<doc id="758711" wikidata="Q1284844" url="?curid=758711" title="History of Dublin">
<text>The city of Dublin can trace its origin back more than 1,000 years, and for much of this time it has been Ireland&#x27;s principal city and the cultural, educational and industrial centre of the island.

==Founding and early history==

The earliest reference to Dublin is sometimes said to be found in the writings of Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy), the Egyptian-Greek astronomer and cartographer, around the year 140, who refers to a settlement called Eblana. This would seem to give Dublin a just claim to nearly two thousand years of antiquity, as the settlement must have existed a considerable time before Ptolemy became aware of it. Recently, however, doubt has been cast on the identification of Eblana with Dublin, and the similarity of the two names is now thought to be coincidental.

Beginning in the 9th and 10th centuries, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841 was known as &quot;Dyflin&quot;, from the Irish &quot;Duiblinn&quot; (&quot;black pool&quot;), which also led to the modern English name. This referred to a dark tidal pool where the River Poddle entered the Liffey on the site of the Castle Gardens at the rear of Dublin Castle. The Gaelic settlement, &quot;Áth Cliath&quot; (&quot;ford of hurdles&quot;) was further upriver, at the site of the present day Father Mathew Bridge at the bottom of Church Street. The Celtic settlement&#x27;s name is still used as the Irish name of the modern city, though the first written evidence of it is found in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; of 1368.

The Vikings, or Ostmen (East-men) as they called themselves, ruled Dublin for almost three centuries, although they were expelled in 902 only to return in 917 and notwithstanding their defeat by the Irish High King Brian Boru at the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014. From that date, the Norse were a minor political force in Ireland, firmly opting for commercial life. Viking rule of Dublin would end completely in 1171 when the city was captured by King Dermot MacMurrough of Leinster, with the aid of Cambro-Norman mercenaries. An attempt was made by the last Norse King of Dublin, Ascall mac Ragnaill, to recapture the city with an army he raised among his relations in the Scottish Highlands, where he fled after the city was taken, but the attempted reconquest failed and Ascall was killed.

The &quot;Thingmote&quot; was a raised mound, high and in circumference, where the Norsemen assembled and made their laws. It stood on the south side of the river, adjacent to Dublin Castle, until 1685. Viking Dublin had a large slave market. Thralls were captured and sold, not only by the Norse but also by warring Irish chiefs.

Dublin celebrated its millennium in 1988 with the slogan &quot;Dublin&#x27;s Great in &#x27;88&quot;. The city is far older than that, but in that year, the Norse King Glun Iarainn recognised Máel Sechnaill II (Máel Sechnaill Mór), High King of Ireland, and agreed to pay taxes and accept Brehon Law. That date was celebrated, but might not be accurate: in 989 (not 988), Mael Seachlainn laid siege to the city for 20 days and captured it. This was not his first attack on the city.

Dublin became the centre of English power in Ireland after the Norman invasion of the southern half of Ireland (Munster and Leinster) in 1169–71, replacing Tara in Meath – the seat of the Gaelic High Kings of Ireland – as the focal point of Ireland&#x27;s polity. On 15 May 1192 Dublin&#x27;s first written &quot;Charter of Liberties&quot; was granted by John, Lord of Ireland, and was addressed to all his &quot;French, English, Irish and Welsh subjects and friends&quot;. On 15 June 1229 his son Henry granted the citizens the right to elect a mayor who was to be assisted by two provosts. By 1400, however, many of the Anglo-Norman conquerors were absorbed into the Gaelic culture, adopting the Irish language and customs, leaving only a small area of Leinster around Dublin, known as the Pale, under direct English control.

==Late medieval Dublin==

After the Anglo-Normans taking of Dublin in 1171, many of the city&#x27;s Norse inhabitants left the old city, which was on the south side of the river Liffey and built their own settlement on the north side, known as Ostmantown or &quot;Oxmantown&quot;. County Dublin was the first county in Ireland to be shired in the 1190s, and the city became the capital of the English Lordship of Ireland. Dublin was peopled extensively with settlers from England and Wales, and the rural area around the city, as far north as Drogheda, also saw extensive English settlement. In the 14th century, this area was fortified against the increasingly assertive native Irish – becoming known as The Pale. In Dublin itself, English rule was centred on Dublin Castle. The city was also the main seat of the Parliament of Ireland from 1297, which was composed of landowners and merchants. Important buildings that date from this time include St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Christchurch Cathedral and St. Audoen&#x27;s Church, all of which are within a kilometre of each other.

The inhabitants of the Pale developed an identity familiar from other settler-colonists of a beleaguered enclave of civilisation surrounded by &quot;barbarous natives&quot;. The siege mentality of medieval Dubliners is best illustrated by their annual pilgrimage to the area called Fiodh Chuilinn, or Holly Wood (rendered in English as Cullenswood) in Ranelagh, where, in 1209, five hundred recent settlers from Bristol had been massacred by the O&#x27;Toole clan during an outing outside the city limits. Every year on &quot;Black Monday&quot;, the Dublin citizens would march out of the city to the spot where the atrocity had happened and raise a black banner in the direction of the mountains to challenge the Irish to battle in a gesture of symbolic defiance. This was still so dangerous that, until the 17th century, the participants had to be guarded by the city militia and a stockade against &quot;the mountain enemy&quot;.

Medieval Dublin was a tightly knit place of around 5,000 to 10,000 people, intimate enough for every newly married citizen to be escorted by the mayor to the city bullring to kiss the enclosure for good luck. It was also very small in area, an enclave hugging the south side of the Liffey of no more than three square kilometres. Outside the city walls were suburbs such as the Liberties, on the lands of the Archbishop of Dublin, and Irishtown, where Gaelic Irish were supposed to live, having been expelled from the city proper by a 15th-century law. Although the native Irish were not supposed to live in the city and its environs, many did so and by the 16th century, English accounts complain that Irish Gaelic was starting to rival English as the everyday language of the Pale.

Life in Medieval Dublin was very precarious. In 1348, the city was hit by the Black Death – a lethal bubonic plague that ravaged Europe in the mid-14th century. In Dublin, victims of the disease were buried in mass graves in an area still known as &quot;Blackpitts&quot;. Though Archaeological excavations in the past ten years have found evidence of a tanning industry in this area, so the name &quot;Blackpitts&quot; may refer to the tanning pits which stained the surrounding area a deep dark colour. The plague recurred regularly in the city until its last major outbreak in 1649.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the city paid tribute, protection money or &quot;black rent&quot; to the neighbouring Irish clans to avoid their predatory raids. In 1315, a Scottish army under Edward the Bruce burned the city&#x27;s suburbs. As English interest in maintaining their Irish colony waned, the defence of Dublin from the surrounding Irish was left to the Fitzgerald Earls of Kildare, who dominated Irish politics until the 16th century. However, this dynasty often pursued its own agenda. In 1487, during the English Wars of the Roses, the Fitzgeralds occupied the city with the aid of troops from Burgundy and proclaimed the Yorkist Lambert Simnel to be King of England. In 1537, the same dynasty, led by Silken Thomas, who was angry at the imprisonment of Garret Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, besieged Dublin Castle. Henry VIII sent a large army to destroy the Fitzgeralds and replace them with English administrators. This was the beginning of a much closer, though not always happy, relationship between Dublin and the English Crown.

==16th and 17th centuries==

Dublin and its inhabitants were transformed by the upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries in Ireland. These saw the first thorough English conquest of the whole island under the Tudor dynasty. While the Old English community of Dublin and the Pale were satisfied with the conquest and disarmament of the native Irish, they were deeply alienated by the Protestant reformation that had taken place in England, being almost all Roman Catholics. In addition, they were angered by being forced to pay for the English garrisons of the country through an extra-parliamentary tax known as &quot;cess&quot;. Several Dubliners were executed for taking part in the Second Desmond Rebellion in the 1580s. The Mayoress of Dublin, Margaret Ball died in captivity in Dublin Castle for her Catholic sympathies in 1584 and a Catholic Archbishop, Dermot O&#x27;Hurley was hanged outside the city walls in the same year.

In 1592, Elizabeth I opened Trinity College Dublin (located at that time outside the city on its eastern side) as a Protestant University for the Irish gentry. However, the important Dublin families spurned it and sent their sons instead to Catholic Universities on continental Europe.

The Dublin community&#x27;s discontent was deepened by the events of the Nine Years War of the 1590s, when English soldiers were required by decree to be housed by the townsmen of Dublin and they spread disease and forced up the price of food. The wounded lay in stalls in the streets, in the absence of a proper hospital. To compound disaffection in the city, in 1597, the English Army&#x27;s gunpowder store in Winetavern Street exploded accidentally, killing nearly 200 Dubliners. The Pale community, however dissatisfied they were with English government, remained hostile to the Gaelic Irish led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill.

As a result of these tensions, the English authorities came to see Dubliners as unreliable and encouraged the settlement there of Protestants from England. These &quot;New English&quot; became the basis of the English administration in Ireland until the 19th century.

Protestants became a majority in Dublin in the 1640s when thousands of them fled there to escape the Irish Rebellion of 1641. When the city was subsequently threatened by Irish Catholic forces, the Catholic Dubliners were expelled from the city by its English garrison. In the 1640s, the city was besieged twice during the Irish Confederate Wars, in 1646 and 1649. However, on both occasions, the attackers were driven off before a lengthy siege could develop.

In 1649, on the second of these occasions, a mixed force of Irish Confederates and Anglo-Irish Royalists were routed by Dublin&#x27;s English Parliamentarian garrison in the Battle of Rathmines, fought on the city&#x27;s southern outskirts.

In the 1650s after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Catholics were banned from dwelling within the city limits under the vengeful Cromwellian settlement but this law was not strictly enforced. Ultimately, this religious discrimination led to the Old English community abandoning their English roots and coming to see themselves as part of the native Irish community.

By the end of the seventeenth century, Dublin was the capital of the English run Kingdom of Ireland – ruled by the Protestant New English minority. Dublin (along with parts of Ulster) was the only part of Ireland in 1700 where Protestants were a majority. In the next century, it became larger, more peaceful and prosperous than at any time in its previous history.

== 18th and 19th centuries ==

===From a medieval to a Georgian city===

By the beginning of the 18th century the English had established control and imposed the harsh Penal Laws on the Catholic majority of Ireland&#x27;s population. In Dublin however the Protestant Ascendancy was thriving, and the city expanded rapidly from the 17th century onward. By 1700, the population had surpassed 60,000, making it the second largest city, after London, in the British Empire. Under the Restoration, Ormonde, the then Lord Deputy of Ireland made the first step toward modernising Dublin by ordering that the houses along the river Liffey had to face the river and have high quality frontages. This was in contrast to the earlier period, when Dublin faced away from the river, often using it as a rubbish dump.

Many of the city&#x27;s notable Georgian buildings and street scape schemes were built during the 18th century. In terms of street layout, at the beginning of the 18th century Dublin was a medieval city akin to Paris. In the course of the eighteenth century (as Paris would in the nineteenth century) it underwent a major rebuilding, with the Wide Streets Commission demolishing many of the narrow medieval streets and replacing them with large Georgian streets. Among the famous streets to appear following this redesign were &quot;Sackville Street&quot; (now called O&#x27;Connell Street), Dame Street, &quot;Westmoreland Street&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;Olier Street&quot;, all built following the demolition of narrow medieval streets and their amalgamation. Five major Georgian squares were also laid out; &quot;Rutland Square&quot; (now called Parnell Square) and &quot;Mountjoy Square&quot; on the northside, and &quot;Merrion Square&quot;, &quot;Fitzwilliam Square&quot; and &quot;Saint Stephen&#x27;s Green&quot;, all on the south of the River Liffey. Though initially the most prosperous residences of peers were located on the northside, in places like Henrietta Street and Rutland Square, the decision of the Earl of Kildare (Ireland&#x27;s premier peer, later made &quot;Duke of Leinster&quot;), to build his new townhouse, &quot;Kildare House&quot; (later renamed Leinster House after he was made Duke of Leinster) on the southside, led to a rush from peers to build new houses on the southside, in or around the three major southern squares.

In 1745 Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St. Patrick&#x27;s, bequeathed his entire estate to found a hospital for &quot;fools and mad&quot; and on 8 August 1746, a Royal Charter was granted to St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital by George II. Following his experiences as a governor of the Bedlam hospital in London, Swift intended the hospital to be designed around the needs of the patients and left instructions on how they were to be treated. The first psychiatric hospital to be built in Ireland, it is one of the oldest in the world and remains one of Ireland&#x27;s leading mental health institutions.


For all its Enlightenment sophistication in fields such as architecture and music (Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was first performed there in Fishamble street), 18th century Dublin remained decidedly rough around the edges. Its slum population rapidly increased fed by the mounting rural migration to the city and housed mostly in the north and south-west quarters of the city. Rival gangs known as the &quot;Liberty Boys&quot;, mostly Protestant weavers from the Liberties and the &quot;Ormonde Boys&quot;, Catholic butchers from Ormonde Market on the northside, fought bloody street battles with each other, sometimes heavily armed and with numerous fatalities. It was also common for the Dublin crowds to hold violent demonstrations outside the Irish Parliament when the members passed unpopular laws. In 1713 the Dublin election riot occurred during a disputed vote as part of the Irish General Election.

One of the effects of continued rural migration to Dublin was that its demographic balance was again altered, Catholics becoming the majority in the city again in the late 18th century.

===Rebellion, Union and Catholic Emancipation===
Until 1800 the city housed the Parliament of Ireland. While parliament was independent, both houses were the exclusive preserve of planters or Old English aristocracy. By the late 18th century, the Ascendancy class of Irish Protestants – who were mostly descendants of British settlers – came to regard Ireland as their native country. This &#x27;Patriot Parliament&#x27; successfully agitated at Westminster for increased autonomy and better terms of trade with Great Britain and the Colonies. From 1778 the Penal Law, which discriminated against Roman Catholics in many areas of life, were gradually repealed, pushed along by liberals such as Henry Grattan. &quot;(See Ireland 1691-1801)&quot;

However, under the influence of the American and French revolutions, some Irish radicals went a step further and formed the United Irishmen to create an independent, non-sectarian and democratic republic. United Irish leaders in Dublin included Napper Tandy, Oliver Bond and Edward Fitzgerald. Wolfe Tone, the leader of the movement, was also from Dublin. The United Irishmen planned to take Dublin in a street rising in 1798, but their leaders were arrested and the city occupied by a large British military presence shortly before the rebels could assemble. There was some local fighting in the city&#x27;s outskirts – such as Rathfarnham, but the city itself remained firmly under control during the 1798 rebellion.
The Protestant Ascendancy was shocked by the events of the 1790s, as was the British government. In response to them, in 1801 under the Irish Act of Union, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland the Irish Parliament voted itself out of existence and Dublin lost its political status as a capital.

Though the city&#x27;s growth continued, it suffered financially from the loss of parliament and more directly from the loss of the income that would come with the arrival of hundreds of peers and MPs and thousands of servants to the capital for sessions of parliament and the social season of the viceregal court in Dublin Castle. Within a short few years, many of the finest mansions, including Leinster House, Powerscourt House and Aldborough House, once owned by peers who spent much of their year in the capital, were for sale. Many of the city&#x27;s once elegant Georgian neighbourhoods rapidly became slums. In 1803, Robert Emmet, the brother of one of the United Irish leaders launched another one-day rebellion in the city, however, it was put down easily and Emmet himself was hanged, drawn and quartered.

In 1829 the wealthier Irish Catholics recovered full citizenship of the United Kingdom. This was partly as a result of agitation by Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who organised mass rallies for Catholic Emancipation in Dublin among other places.

In 1840, Thomas Drummond, the Liberal Under-Secretary for Ireland, passed the Corporation Act, which totally reformed local government in Ireland. In Dublin this meant that the old franchise system, based on Protestant property holders and guild members was abolished and the vote for Dublin Corporation was granted to all property holders of over ten pounds per year. This meant that Catholics, having been excluded from municipal government since the 1690s, became a 2–1 majority in the electorate. Daniel O&#x27;Connell, as a result, was elected mayor in 1841, the first elections held with the new franchise.

O&#x27;Connell also campaigned unsuccessfully for a restoration of Irish legislative autonomy or Repeal of the Union. He organised mass rallies known as &quot;Monster Meetings&quot; to pressure the British government to concede the return of the Irish Parliament, abolished in 1801 under the Act of Union, to Dublin. The climax of his campaign was supposed to be a rally at Clontarf, just north of the city, which was chosen for its symbolic importance due to the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected to attend the meeting, but the British government banned it and sent in troops to suppress it. O&#x27;Connell backed down and his movement split and lost momentum.

O&#x27;Connell is also remembered among trade unionists in the city to this day for calling on the British army to suppress a strike during his tenure.

===Late 19th century===

After Emancipation and with the gradual extension of the right to vote in British politics, Irish nationalists (mainly Catholics) gained control of Dublin&#x27;s government with the reform of local government in 1840, Daniel O&#x27;Connell being the first Catholic Mayor in 150 years. Increasing wealth prompted many of Dublin&#x27;s Protestant and Unionist middle classes to move out of the city proper to new suburbs such as Ballsbridge, Rathmines and Rathgar – which are still distinguished by their graceful Victorian architecture. A new railway also connected Dublin with the middle class suburb of Dún Laoghaire, renamed Kingstown in 1821.

Dublin, unlike Belfast in the north, did not experience the full effect of the Industrial Revolution and as a result, the number of unskilled unemployed was always high in the city. Industries like the Guinness brewery, Jameson Distillery, and Jacob&#x27;s biscuit factory provided the most stable employment. New working class suburbs grew up in Kilmainham and Inchicore around them. Another major employer was the Dublin tramways system, run by a private company – the Dublin United Tramway Company. By 1900 Belfast had a larger population than Dublin, though it is smaller today.
In 1867, the Irish Republican Brotherhood or &#x27;Fenians&#x27;, attempted an insurrection aimed at the ending of British rule in Ireland. However, the rebellion was badly organised and failed to get off the ground. In Dublin, fighting was confined to the suburb of Tallaght. Several thousand Fenians (estimated at between 4–8,000 men) marched out to Tallaght Hill, and some fought a brief skirmish with the police at the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Tallaght. However, due to poor leadership and unclear plans, they dispersed shortly thereafter, several hundred were arrested. The failure of this rebellion did not mark the end of nationalist violence however. An attempt to free three Fenian prisoners in Manchester killed a guard, for which three Fenians were hanged. Dublin saw mass demonstrations in solidarity with those executed and an amnesty campaign for the other Fenian prisoners.

In 1882, an offshoot of the Fenians, who called themselves the Irish National Invincibles, assassinated two prominent members of the British administration with surgical knives in the Phoenix Park, in reprisal for the introduction of Coercion Acts against the Land League and the RIC killing of two demonstrators in County Mayo. The incident became known as the Phoenix Park killings and was universally condemned.

Under the 1898 Local Government Act, the electorate to Dublin Corporation was expanded to include all rate payers. Greater powers of administration were also devolved to local government, as part of a political strategy by the Conservative party of &quot;killing Home Rule with kindness&quot;, or placating Irish nationalist grievances.

==Early 20th century==

===Monto===
Although Dublin declined in terms of wealth and importance after the Act of Union, it grew steadily in size throughout the 19th century. By 1900, the population was over 400,000. While the city grew, so did its level of poverty. Though described as &quot;the second city of the (British) Empire&quot;, its large number of tenements became infamous, being mentioned by writers such as James Joyce. An area called &quot;Monto&quot; (in or around &quot;Montgomery Street&quot; off Sackville Street) became infamous also as the British Empire&#x27;s biggest red-light district, its financial viability aided by the number of British Army barracks and hence soldiers in the city, notably the &quot;Royal Barracks&quot; (later Collins Barracks and now one of the locations of Ireland&#x27;s National Museum). &quot;Monto&quot; finally closed in the mid-1920s, following a campaign against prostitution by the Roman Catholic Legion of Mary, its financial viability having already been seriously undermined by the withdrawal of soldiers from the city following the Anglo-Irish Treaty (December 1921) and the establishment of the Irish Free State (6 December 1922).

===The Lockout===
In 1913, Dublin experienced one of the largest and most bitter labour disputes ever seen in Britain or Ireland – known as the Lockout. James Larkin, a militant syndicalist trade unionist, founded the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) and tried to win improvements in wages and conditions for unskilled and semi-skilled workers. His means were negotiation and if necessary sympathetic strikes. In response, William Martin Murphy, who owned the Dublin Tram Company, organised a cartel of employers who agreed to sack any ITGWU members and to make other employees agree not to join it. Larkin in turn called the Tram workers out on strike, which was followed by the sacking, or &quot;lockout&quot;, of any workers in Dublin who would not resign from the union. Within a month, 25,000 workers were either on strike or locked out. Demonstrations during the dispute were marked by vicious rioting with the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which left three people dead and hundreds more injured. James Connolly in response founded the Irish Citizen Army to defend strikers from the police. The lock-out lasted for six months, after which most workers, many of whose families were starving, resigned from the union and returned to work.

==End of British Rule==

In 1914, after nearly three decades of agitation, Ireland seemed on the brink of Home Rule (or self-government), however, instead of a peaceful handover from direct British rule to limited Irish autonomy, Ireland and Dublin saw nearly ten years of political violence and instability that eventually resulted in a much more complete break with Britain than Home Rule would have represented. By 1923, Dublin was the capital of the Irish Free State, an all but independent Irish state, governing 26 of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties.

===Howth Gun Running 1914===

Unionists, predominantly concentrated in Ulster, though also with significant numbers in Dublin and throughout the country, resisted the introduction of Home Rule and founded the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) – a private army – to this end. In response, nationalists founded their own army, the Irish Volunteers, to make sure Home Rule became a reality. In April 1914, thousands of German weapons were imported by the UVF into the north (see Larne gunrunning). Some within the Irish Volunteers, and other nationalists unconnected with that organisation, attempted to do the same in July. The crew of &quot;Asgard&quot; successfully landed a consignment of surplus German rifles and ammunition at Howth, near Dublin. Shortly after the cargo was landed, British troops from the Scottish Borderers regiment tried to seize them but were unsuccessful. The soldiers were jeered by Dublin crowds when they returned to the city centre and they retaliated by opening fire at Bachelors Walk, killing three people. Ireland appeared to be on the brink of civil war by the time the Home Rule Bill was actually passed in September 1914. However, the outbreak of World War I led to its shelving. John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party and soon to be head of the Irish National Volunteers (but not of the Irish Volunteers), called on nationalists to join the British Army. This caused a split in the Volunteers. Thousands of Irishmen did join (particularly those from working-class areas, where unemployment was high) and many died in the war. The majority, who followed Redmond&#x27;s leadership, formed the National Volunteers. A militant minority kept the title of Irish Volunteers, some of whom were now prepared to fight against, rather than with British forces for Irish independence.

===Easter Rising 1916===

In April 1916 about 1,250 armed Irish republicans under Padraig Pearse staged what became known as the Easter Rising in Dublin in pursuit not of Home Rule but of an Irish Republic. One of the rebels&#x27; first acts was to declare this Republic to be in existence. The rebels were composed of Irish Volunteers and the much smaller Irish Citizen Army under James Connolly. The rising saw rebel forces take over strongpoints in the city, including the Four Courts, Stephen&#x27;s Green, Boland&#x27;s mill, the South Dublin Union, and Jacobs Biscuit Factory and establishing their headquarters at the General Post Office building in O&#x27;Connell Street. They held for a week until they were forced to surrender to British troops. The British deployed artillery to bombard the rebels into submission, sailing a gunboat named the Helga up the Liffey and stationing field guns at Cabra, Phibsborough and Prussia street. Much of the city centre was destroyed by shell fire and around 450 people, about half of them civilians, were killed, with another 1,500 injured. Fierce combat took place along the grand canal at Mount Street, where British troops were repeatedly ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the rebellion was marked by a wave of looting and lawlessness by Dublin&#x27;s slum population and many of the city centre&#x27;s shops were ransacked. The rebel commander, Patrick Pearse surrendered after a week, to avoid further civilian casualties. Initially, the rebellion was generally unpopular in Dublin, due to the amount of death and destruction it caused, the opinion by some that it was bad timing to irreverently hold it at Easter, and also due to the fact that many Dubliners had relatives serving in the British Army. Over 7,000 claims for compensation were submitted to the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee following the rebellion. Reconstruction work under the overview of the Dublin city architect began following the passing of the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act 1916.

Though the rebellion was relatively easily suppressed by the British military and initially faced with the hostility of most Irish people, public opinion swung gradually but decisively behind the rebels, after 16 of their leaders were executed by the British military in the aftermath of the Rising. In December 1918 the party now taken over by the rebels, Sinn Féin, won an overwhelming majority of Irish parliamentary seats. Instead of taking their seats in the British House of Commons, they assembled in the Lord Mayor of Dublin&#x27;s residence and proclaimed the Irish Republic to be in existence and themselves Dáil Éireann (the Assembly of Ireland) -its parliament.

===War of Independence 1919–1921===
Between 1919 and 1921 Ireland experienced the Irish War of Independence -a guerrilla conflict between the British forces and the Irish Volunteers, now reconstituted as the Irish Republican Army. The Dublin IRA units waged an urban guerrilla campaign against police and the British army in the city. In 1919, the violence began with small numbers of IRA men (known as &quot;the Squad&quot;) under Michael Collins assassinating police detectives in the city. By late 1920, this had expanded into much more intensive operations, including regular gun and grenade attacks on British troops. The IRA in Dublin tried to carry out three shooting or bombing attacks a day. Such was the regularity of attacks on British patrols, that the Camden-Aungier streets area (running from the military barracks at Portobello to Dublin Castle) was nicknamed the &quot;Dardanelles&quot; (site of the Gallipoli campaign) by British soldiers.

The conflict produced many tragic incidents in the city, of which a number are still remembered today. In September 1920, 18-year-old IRA man Kevin Barry was captured during an ambush on Church street in the north city in which three British soldiers were killed. Barry was hanged for murder on 1 November, despite a campaign for leniency because of his youth. Another celebrated republican martyr was IRA gunman Seán Treacy, who was killed in a shoot-out on Talbot street in October 1920 after a prolonged manhunt for him. The British forces, in particular the Black and Tans, often retaliated to IRA actions with brutality of their own. One example of this was the Black and Tans burning of the town of Balbriggan, just north of Dublin in September 1920 and the &quot;Drumcondra murders&quot; of February 1921, when Auxiliary Division troops murdered two suspected IRA men in the city&#x27;s northern suburb.

The bloodiest single day of these &quot;troubles&quot; (as they were known at the time) in Dublin was Bloody Sunday on 21 November 1920, when the Michael Collins&#x27; &quot;Squad&quot; assassinated 18 British agents (see Cairo gang) around the city in the early hours of the morning. The British forces retaliated by opening fire on a Gaelic football crowd in Croke Park in the afternoon, killing 14 civilians and wounding 65. In the evening, three republican activists were arrested and killed in Dublin Castle.

In response to the escalating violence, the British troops mounted a number of major operations in Dublin to try to locate IRA members. From 15 to 17 January 1921, they cordoned off an area of the north inner city bounded by Capel Street, Church Street and North King Street, allowing no one in or out and searching house to house for weapons and suspects. In February they repeated the process in Mountjoy Square and then the Kildare Street-Nassau Street area; however, these curfews produced few results. The largest single IRA operation in Dublin during the conflict came on 25 May 1921, the IRA Dublin Brigade burned down the Custom House, one of Dublin&#x27;s finest buildings, which housed the headquarters of local government in Ireland; however, the British were soon alerted and surrounded the building. Five IRA men were killed and over 80 captured in the operation, which was a publicity coup but a military disaster for the IRA.

===Civil War, 1922–23===
Following a truce (declared on 11 July 1921), a negotiated peace known as the Anglo-Irish Treaty between Britain and Ireland was signed. It created a self-governing twenty-six county Irish state, known as the Irish Free State. However, it also disestablished the Irish Republic, which many in the nationalist movement and the IRA, in particular, felt they were bound by oath to uphold. This triggered the outbreak of the Irish Civil War of 1922–23, when the intransigent republicans took up arms against those who had accepted a compromise with the British. The Civil war began in Dublin, where Anti-Treaty forces under Rory O&#x27;Connor took over the Four Courts and several other buildings in April 1922, hoping to provoke the British into restarting the fighting. This put the Free State, led by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith into the dilemma of facing British military re-occupation or fighting their own former comrades in the Four Courts.

After some prevarication and after Winston Churchill had actually ordered British troops to assault the rebels, Collins decided he had to act and borrowed British artillery to shell the republicans in the Four Courts. They surrendered after a two-day (28–30 June 1922) artillery bombardment by Free State troops but some of their IRA comrades occupied O&#x27;Connell Street, which saw street fighting for another week before the Free State Army secured the capital (see Battle of Dublin). Over 60 combatants were killed in the fighting, including senior republican Cathal Brugha. About 250 civilians are also thought to have been killed or injured, but the total has never been accurately counted. Oscar Traynor conducted some guerrilla operations south of the city until his capture in late July 1922. Ernie O&#x27;Malley, the republican commander for the province of Leinster was captured after a shootout in the Ballsbridge area in November 1922. On 6 December 1922, the IRA assassinated Seán Hales, a member of the Dáil, as he was leaving Leinster House in Dublin city centre, in reprisal for the executions of their prisoners by the Free State. The following day, the four leaders of the republicans in the Four Courts (Rory O&#x27;Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barret, and Joe McKelvey) were executed in revenge. Dublin was relatively quiet thereafter, although guerrilla war raged in the provinces. The new Free State government eventually suppressed this insurrection by mid-1923. In April, Frank Aiken, IRA chief of staff, ordered the anti-treaty forces to dump their arms and go home. The civil war left a permanent strain of bitterness in Irish politics that did much to sour the achievement of national independence.

==Independence and 20th century==
Dublin had suffered severely in the period 1916–1922. It was the scene of a week&#x27;s heavy street fighting in 1916 and again on the outbreak of the civil war in 1922. The casualties in Dublin of the revolutionary period from 1916 to 1923 come to about 1,000 dead – 482 killed in the 1916 Easter Rising, another 309 fatal casualties in the 1919–21 War of Independence and finally about 250 killed in the city and county in the Civil War of 1922–23.

Many of Dublin&#x27;s finest buildings were destroyed at this time; the historic General Post Office (GPO) was a bombed out shell after the 1916 Rising; James Gandon&#x27;s Custom House was burned by the IRA in the War of Independence, while one of Gandon&#x27;s surviving masterpieces, the Four Courts had been seized by republicans and bombarded by the pro-treaty army. (Republicans in response senselessly booby trapped the Irish Public Records Office, destroying one thousand years of archives). These buildings were later re-built.

The new state set itself up as best it could. Its Governor-General was installed in the former Viceregal Lodge, residence of the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, because it was thought to be one of the few places where he was not in danger from republican assassins. Parliament was set up temporarily in the Duke of Leinster&#x27;s old palace, Leinster House, where it has remained ever since. Over time, the GPO, Custom House and Four Courts were rebuilt. While major schemes were proposed for Dublin, no major remodelling took place initially.

===The &quot;Emergency&quot;===

Ireland was officially neutral during the Second World War (see Irish neutrality during World War II). So much so that it was not even called &quot;the war&quot; in Irish discourse, but &quot;The Emergency&quot;. Although Dublin escaped the mass bombing of the war due to Ireland&#x27;s neutrality, the German air-force bombed Dublin on 31 May 1941, and hit the North Strand – a working-class district in the north inner city – killing 34 Irish civilians and wounding another 90. The bombing was declared accidental, although many suspected that the bombing was deliberate revenge for de Valera&#x27;s decision to send fire engines to aid the people of Belfast following major bombing in that city. One faction of the IRA hoped to take advantage of the war by getting German help and invading Northern Ireland. In December 1939 they successfully stole almost all the Irish Army&#x27;s reserve ammunition in a raid on the Magazine Fort in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park. In retaliation, de Valera&#x27;s government interned IRA members and executed several of them. The war years also saw rationing imposed on Dublin and the temporary enlargement of the small Jewish community by Jews who fled there from Nazi persecution.
===Tackling the tenements===

The first efforts to tackle Dublin&#x27;s extensive slum areas came on the foundation of the Iveagh Trust in 1891, and the Dublin Artisan Dwellings Company, but these could only help several thousand families. The main focus of the government in 1900–1914 was on building 40,000 cottages for rural workers. Some public planning for the city was made in the first years of the Irish Free State and then effected after 1932, when Éamon de Valera came to power. With greater finances available, and lower wages due to the Great Depression, major changes began to take place. A scheme of replacing tenements with decent housing for Dublin&#x27;s poor began. Some new suburbs such as Marino and Crumlin were built but Dublin&#x27;s inner city slums remained.

It was not until the 1960s that substantial progress was made in removing Dublin&#x27;s tenements, with thousands of Dublin&#x27;s working-class population being moved to suburban housing estates around the edge of the city. The success of this project was mixed. Although the tenements were largely removed, such was the urgency of providing new housing that little planning went into its construction. New and growing suburbs like Tallaght, Coolock and Ballymun instantly acquired huge populations, of up to 50,000 people in Tallaght&#x27;s case, without any provision of shops, public transport or employment. As a result, for several decades, these places became by-words for crime, drug abuse and unemployment. In recent years, such problems have eased somewhat, with the advent of Ireland&#x27;s so-called &#x27;Celtic Tiger&#x27; economic boom. Tallaght in particular has become far more socially mixed and now has very extensive commercial, transport and leisure facilities. Ballymun Flats, one of the State&#x27;s few high-rise housing schemes, was largely demolished and re-designed in recent years.

Ironically, however, given Ireland&#x27;s new-found economic prosperity, and consequent immigration, there is once again a housing shortage in the city. Increased employment has led to a rapid rise in the city&#x27;s population. As a result, prices for bought and rented accommodation have risen sharply, leading to many younger Dubliners leaving the city to buy cheaper accommodation in counties Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow, while still commuting daily to Dublin. This has arguably impacted negatively on the quality of life in the city – leading to severe traffic problems, long commuting times and urban sprawl.

===Destruction of Georgian Dublin in the 1960s===

As part of the building programme that also cleared the inner city slums, from the 1950s onwards, historic Georgian Dublin came under concerted attack by the Irish Government&#x27;s development policies. Whole swathes of 18th-century houses were demolished, notably in Fitzwilliam Street and St Stephen&#x27;s Green, to make way for utilitarian office blocks and government departments. Much of this development was fuelled by property developers and speculators keen to cash in on the buoyant property markets of the 1960s, late 1970s and 1980s. Many schemes were built by Government supporters with the intention of profitably letting to highly desirable State tenants such as government departments and State agencies. It has been proven that many buildings were approved by government ministers personally connected with the developers involved, often to the detriment of the taxpayer and the proper planning and preservation of Dublin city.

Some of this development was also encouraged by Ireland&#x27;s dominant nationalist ideology of that era, which wanted to wipe away all physical reminders of Ireland&#x27;s colonial past. An extreme example of this kind of thinking was the destruction of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in O&#x27;Connell Street in 1966. This statue of the famous British admiral was a Dublin landmark for a century, but was blown up by a small bomb shortly before the 50-year commemorations of the Easter Rising. In 2003, the Pillar was replaced as a landmark by the Dublin Spire which was erected on the same spot. A 120 m tall tapered metal pole, it is the tallest structure of Dublin city centre, visible for miles. It was assembled from seven pieces with the largest crane available in Ireland and is the tallest street sculpture in the world.

Far from the destructive practices of the 1960s diminishing as time went on, if anything they got steadily worse, with the concrete office blocks of earlier times being replaced with the idea of Georgian pastiche or replica offices in place of original 18th century stock. Whole swathes of Harcourt Street and St. Stephen&#x27;s Green were demolished and rebuilt in such a fashion in the 1970s and 1980s, as were parts of Parnell Square, Kildare Street, North Great George&#x27;s Street and many other areas around the city. Many saw this practice as an &#x27;easy way out&#x27; for planners; a venerable Georgian front was maintained, whilst &#x27;progress&#x27; was allowed to continue unhindered.
This planning policy was pursued by Dublin Corporation until around 1990, when the forces of conservationism finally took hold.
However, it was not only sites associated with the British presence in Ireland that fell victim to Irish developers. Wood Quay where the oldest remains of Viking Dublin were located was also demolished, and replaced with the headquarters of Dublin&#x27;s local government, though not without a long and acrimonious planning struggle between the government and preservationists. More recently there has been a similar controversy over plans to build the M50 motorway through the site of Carrickmines Castle, part of the Pale&#x27;s southern frontier in medieval times. It has recently been alleged that much controversial building work in Dublin-—over green spaces as well as historic buildings—-was allowed as a result of bribery and patronage of politicians by developers. Since the late 1990s, there have been a series of tribunals set up to investigate corruption in Dublin&#x27;s planning process.

===Northern Troubles===

Dublin was affected to varying degrees by &quot;the Troubles&quot; a civil conflict that raged in Northern Ireland from 1969 to the late 1990s. In 1972, angry crowds in Dublin burned down the British Embassy in Merrion Square in protest at the shooting of 13 civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday (1972) by British troops. The IRA Southern Command was headquartered in Dublin and was responsible for training camps, recruiting, financing, safe houses, and weapons procurement in the Republic or overseas to support IRA Northern Command operations in Northern Ireland (see Provisional IRA in the Republic of Ireland). This safe haven in the Republic primarily contributed to the longevity of the conflict.

However the city did not generally experience paramilitary violence directly, with the exception a period in the early to mid 1970s when it was the target of several loyalist bombings. The 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings killed 3 people and injured 185. The worst bomb attacks, however, occurred on Talbot street in 1974. The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings on 17 May 1974 were a series of terrorist attacks on Dublin and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland which left 33 people dead (26 of them in Dublin), and almost 300 injured, the largest number of casualties in any single day in the Troubles. Although no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks at the time, loyalist paramilitaries from Northern Ireland (in particular the Ulster Volunteer Force) were widely blamed. In 1993 the Ulster Volunteer Force admitted they carried out the attacks. It has been widely speculated that the bombers were aided by members of the British security forces.

In the early 1970s the Irish government cancelled the hitherto annual Easter parade commemorating the Rising of 1916 and in 1976 banned it, fearing it was serving as a recruiting tool for illegal republican paramilitaries. Nevertheless, the Provisional republican movement organised a demonstration 10,000 strong on Easter Sunday. However the risks the Provisional IRA posed to the state were highlighted several months later when the organisation assassinated the British Ambassador to Ireland Christopher Ewart-Biggs near his home at Sandyford in south Dublin.

In 1981, there was considerable solidarity in Dublin with republican paramilitaries who were on hunger strike in Northern prisons. When Anti H-Block Irish republican protesters, over 15,000 strong, tried to storm the new British Embassy (reconstructed after the events of 1972) there took place several hours violent rioting with over 1,500 Gardaí, before the protesters were dispersed. Over 200 people were injured and dozens arrested.

Other, more peaceful demonstrations were held in the 1990s in Dublin, calling for the end of the Provisional IRA campaign in the North. The largest of these took place in 1993, when up to 20,000 people demonstrated in O&#x27;Connell Street after the IRA killed two children with a bomb in Warrington in northern England. Similar demonstrations occurred in 1995 and 1996 when the IRA ended its ceasefire, called in 1994, by bombing London and Manchester.

On 25 February 2006 rioting broke out between Gardaí and a group of hardline Irish Republicans protesting the march of a &quot;Love Ulster&quot;, loyalist parade in O&#x27;Connell Street. The small group of political activists were joined by hundreds of local youths and running battles continued on O&#x27;Connell Street for almost three hours, where three shops were looted. The marchers themselves were bussed to Kildare street for a token march past Dáil Éireann which prompted some 200 or so rioters to move from O&#x27;Connell street to the Nassau street area, setting cars alight, attacking property, including the headquarters of the Progressive Democrats, before dispersing.

===Regeneration of Dublin===

Since the 1980s, there has been a greater awareness among Dublin&#x27;s planners of the need to preserve Dublin&#x27;s architectural heritage. Preservation orders have been put on most of Dublin&#x27;s Georgian neighbourhoods. The new awareness was also reflected in the development of Temple Bar, the last surviving part of Dublin that contained its original medieval street plan. In the 1970s, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the state transport company, bought up many of the buildings in this area, with a view to building a large modern central bus station on the site with a shopping centre attached. However, most of the buildings had been rented by artists, producing a sudden and unexpected appearance of a &#x27;cultural quarter&#x27; that earned comparisons with Paris&#x27;s Left Bank. The vibrancy of the Temple Bar area led to demands for its preservation. By the late 1980s, the bus station plans were abandoned and a master plan was put in place to maintain Temple Bar&#x27;s position as Dublin&#x27;s cultural heartland, with large-scale government support. That process has been a mixed success. While the medieval street plan has survived, rents have rocketed, forcing the artists elsewhere. They have been replaced by restaurants and bars which draw thousands of tourists but which have been criticised for over-commercialisation and excessive alcohol consumption. Also, in the late 1980s, the Grafton and Henry street areas were pedestrianised.

However, the real transformation of Dublin has occurred since the late 1990s, when the so-called &#x27;Celtic Tiger&#x27; economic boom took effect. The city, previously full of derelict sites, has seen a building boom – especially the construction of new office blocks and apartments. The most visually spectacular of these developments is the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC)- a financial district almost a kilometre long situated along the north quays. While the former tramways had been torn up in the 1950s in favour of buses, the new Luas tram service started in 2004. Though slow to develop, Dublin Airport had become the 16th busiest international airport by 2007.

===Heroin problem===

In the late 1970s, &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, Dublin suffered a serious wave of drug addiction and associated crime throughout its working-class areas. The introduction of the drug heroin into the inner city in the late 1970s accentuated social problems associated with unemployment, poor housing and poverty. These problems were twofold. Firstly, heroin addiction caused a wave of petty crime such as muggings, robbery and so forth as addicts tried to secure money for their next &quot;fix&quot;. This made many of the affected areas all but un-inhabitable for the rest of the population. In addition, many addicts ultimately died from diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis caused by sharing needles. Secondly, the drug trade saw the establishment of serious organised crime syndicates in the city, whose use of violence led to many murders being committed. The most notorious of these killings was that of the journalist Veronica Guerin in 1996, who was killed by criminals she was investigating for a Sunday newspaper. The drugs problem led to a widespread anti-drugs movement, the most well known group was the Concerned Parents Against Drugs, which peaked in the mid-1990s, whose members tried to force drug dealers out of their neighbourhoods. The anti-drugs campaigners were accused of being vigilantes, or a front for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, although this allegation has been vigorously disputed.

==Twenty First Century==
===Immigration===
Dublin was traditionally a city of inward migration, with its population steadily growing, even as that of the rest of Ireland fell, from the mid-19th century. The population of the city doubled over the course of that century to about 400,000 people by 1900 It doubled again over the course of the twentieth century, reaching nearly one million by 1980. However, the vast bulk of people arriving in the city came from the rest of Ireland. There was also significant emigration from the city due to persistently high unemployment and a high birth rate, leading many of its inhabitants to leave, notably to Britain and the United States in search of work. However, the 21st century saw this process reversed dramatically, with the Irish economic boom attracting immigrants from all over the world. The largest single group to arrive in the city were initially returning Irish emigrants, but there was also substantial immigration from other nationalities. Dublin became home by the early 2000s to large communities of Chinese, Nigerians, Brazilians, Russians, Romanians and many others – especially from Africa and eastern Europe. After the accession of several eastern European countries into the European Union in 2004, eastern Europeans became the single largest immigrant group in Dublin. Poland was the most common single point of origin, with well over 150,000 young Poles having arrived in Ireland since late 2004; the majority being concentrated in Dublin and its environs.

The first wave of immigration into Dublin dipped during the financial crash of 2008-9, which hit Ireland and Dublin&#x27;s economy hard. However, as the economy recovered, immigration began to Dublin pick up again, rising sharply in the late 2010s and 2020s. By 2022, the county of Dublin&#x27;s population had risen to over 1.4 million, over 17 per cent of whom were foreign-born. In inner-city Dublin the proportion of foreign-born residents was much higher, with only 36 per cent in the north inner city area describing themselves as &#x27;white Irish&#x27; in the 2022 census. Unlike the previous wave of migration, the majority of the late 2010s and 2020s migrants were from outside of Europe, the largest groups of foreign citizens now being Brazilians and Indians, followed by Poles and Romanians. The post-pandemic migration to Dublin, from 2022 onwards also saw a sharp rise in the arrival of those claiming asylum, with up to 600 arriving every week in 2024, many of whom ended up living in makeshift camps as no accommodation was available. 

By the 2020s, some antagonism had begun to develop against immigrants, particularly asylum seekers in Dublin, with numerous protests against the placement of migrants in places such as the East Wall, Finglas, Coolock and elsewhere. Some of these included the burning of buildings, such as a disused hotel in Ringsend, that were thought to have been intended to house asylum seekers. In November 2023, a serious riot broke out on O&#x27;Connell Street, after a man of Algerian origin stabbed several schoolchildren in adjoining Parnell Square. A crowd first attempted to break into the crime scene and began attacking Gardai. A Luas tram and four Dublin Bus vehicles were set on fire and several shops were looted. Dublin City Council estimated the damage done as costing 20 million euros to repair. The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris described the rioters as &#x27;a lunatic, hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology&#x27;.

<text>In number theory, a noncototient is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the difference between a positive integer and the number of coprime integers below it. That is, , where stands for Euler&#x27;s totient function, has no solution for . The &quot;cototient&quot; of is defined as , so a noncototient is a number that is never a cototient.

It is conjectured that all noncototients are even. This follows from a modified form of the slightly stronger version of the Goldbach conjecture: if the even number can be represented as a sum of two distinct primes and , then

formula_1

It is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 5 is a noncototient. The remaining odd numbers are covered by the observations , , and .

For even numbers, it can be shown
formula_2

Thus, all even numbers such that can be written as with primes are cototients.

The first few noncototients are

:10, 26, 34, 50, 52, 58, 86, 100, 116, 122, 130, 134, 146, 154, 170, 172, 186, 202, 206, 218, 222, 232, 244, 260, 266, 268, 274, 290, 292, 298, 310, 326, 340, 344, 346, 362, 366, 372, 386, 394, 404, 412, 436, 466, 470, 474, 482, 490, ... 

The cototient of are
:0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 6, 1, 8, 1, 8, 7, 8, 1, 12, 1, 12, 9, 12, 1, 16, 5, 14, 9, 16, 1, 22, 1, 16, 13, 18, 11, 24, 1, 20, 15, 24, 1, 30, 1, 24, 21, 24, 1, 32, 7, 30, 19, 28, 1, 36, 15, 32, 21, 30, 1, 44, 1, 32, 27, 32, 17, 46, 1, 36, 25, 46, 1, 48, ...

Erdős (1913–1996) and Sierpinski (1882–1969) asked whether there exist infinitely many noncototients. This was finally answered in the affirmative by Browkin and Schinzel (1995), who showed every member of the infinite family formula_3 is an example (See Riesel number). Since then other infinite families, of roughly the same form, have been given by Flammenkamp and Luca (2000).

<doc id="758725" wikidata="Q313369" url="?curid=758725" title="Alonso de Ojeda">
<text>Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 – c. 1515) was a Spanish explorer, governor and conquistador. He travelled through modern-day Guyana, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, Curaçao, Aruba and Colombia, at times with Amerigo Vespucci and Juan de la Cosa. He is famous for having named Venezuela, which he explored during his first two expeditions, for having been the first European to visit Guyana, Curaçao, Colombia, and Lake Maracaibo, and later for founding Santa Cruz (La Guairita).

== Early life ==
Alonso de Ojeda was born in Torrejoncillo del Rey, New Castile around 1466. His father, Rodrigo de Huete, was a minor noble who fought for Isabel in 1474 during the War of the Castilian Succession. Isabel was grateful for his support and put his son, Alonso, under her protection. In his youth, Alonso served the Duke of Medinaceli, Luis de la Cerda. In service to the duke, he distinguished himself in the conquest of Granada with his military abilities, his skill as a swordsman and his bravery.

Alonso was slight of stature, clever, and handsome. It was reputed that he was always the first to draw blood in any fight. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, he combined &quot;in his person all the bodily perfections that man could have, despite his small size.&quot;

== Arrival in Hispaniola ==
Following Columbus&#x27;s successful first voyage of discovery, a second voyage with a much larger fleet was organized for Columbus by Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca. Medinaceli had been a patron of both Columbus and Ojeda, so perhaps it is not surprising that Ojeda was selected at a relatively young age to captain one of the ships on this new voyage. Fonseca was also impressed with Ojeda and would later become his most important patron.

The fleet sailed for the island of Hispaniola in September 1493 and reached the Caribbean in November. One of their first stops was the island of Guadalupe where a landing party went missing. Fearing for their safety (the islanders were suspected of being cannibals), Columbus sent Ojeda ashore with an armed contingent to search for the lost group. The missing party eventually showed up on their own but Ojeda&#x27;s search turned up additional evidence that the Caribs on the island did practice cannibalism.

They reached Hispaniola at the end of November and discovered the fort, Navidad, constructed during the first voyage was in ruins and all the Spaniards left behind were dead. The local natives blamed the trouble on a cacique from the interior named Caonabo. They began to explore the island and build a permanent settlement named Isabela. In January 1494, Columbus sent a small armed party led by Ojeda to search for gold in a mountainous region of the island known as Cibao. Ojeda returned two weeks later bringing a few substantial gold nuggets and reporting there was much gold to be found in the area.

The discovery of gold focused attention on Cibao. In March 1494 Columbus led a group of nearly 500 men to explore the region. The hunt for gold was unsuccessful but natives from the surrounding area brought in gold for trade. Columbus established a fort, Santo Tomas (named as a rebuke to those who doubted the presence of gold), to serve as a trading post and as a base for further prospecting. , a nobleman from Aragon and a confidant of the king, was put in command of the fort when Columbus returned to Isabela.

In April 1494, Columbus sent Ojeda with a force of about 350 soldiers to relieve de Margarit at Santo Tomas. Columbus wanted de Margarit to take the bulk of the soldiers and search the island for gold, seize food from the natives, and capture Caonabo. At an important river crossing controlled by a friendly tribe, Ojeda arrested the local cacique and other officials with the allegation that some clothes had been stolen during a previous expedition. Ojeda cut the ears off one captive and sent the rest back to Isabela in chains. Ojeda&#x27;s brutal punishment shocked the local people and turned them against the Spaniards. When Ojeda arrived at the fort, de Margarit refused to follow Columbus&#x27;s orders and remained at the fort with his men. Not long after, he returned to Spain, disapproving of the chaotic situation and mistreatment of the Indians.

After de Margarit&#x27;s refusal to capture Caonabo, Columbus ordered Ojeda to find the cacique allegedly responsible for destroying the original Spanish settlement at Navidad. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, Ojeda presented Caonabo with a fine set of polished brass manacles and shackles and convinced him to wear them as a symbol of royalty. The ruse was successful and Ojeda brought the chief back to Columbus.

Following Ojeda&#x27;s mistreatment of the Indians at the river, a fort had to be built to protect the vital crossing. Late in 1494, the first Indian rebellion took place at this spot; the fort was destroyed and ten Spaniards killed by the local tribes. Columbus retaliated with a force of 500 led by Ojeda. The rebels were badly beaten and some 1500 were taken as slaves—600 were shipped to Spain and the remaining were parceled out to those on the island.

Alonso de Ojeda also took part in the battle of Vega Real (also called the battle of Jáquimo), in which, under his command, the Spanish were victorious. An account of the battle written by Las Casas states that the native army comprised ten thousand warriors, while there were only some four hundred Spanish soldiers. Of course, these figures may have been exaggerated. Ojeda returned to Spain in 1496.

== First voyage to Venezuela ==
On returning to Spain, Ojeda was commissioned by the Catholic Monarchs, without the permission of Columbus, to sail for America again, which he did on 18 May 1499 with three caravels. He travelled with the pilot and cartographer Juan de la Cosa and the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci. While Columbus had touched a small portion of Venezuelan coast in 1498, it was only after this voyage that sustained contact with indigenous people was established. This was the first of a series of what have become known as the &quot;minor journeys&quot; or &quot;Andalusian journeys&quot; that were made to the New World.

On leaving Spain the flotilla sailed along the west coast of Africa to Cape Verde before taking the same route that Columbus had used a year before on his third voyage. After making landfall Vespucci decided to separate from the flotilla and he sailed south towards Brazil. The main flotilla arrived at the mouths of the rivers Essequibo and Orinoco in the Gulf of Paria. It also visited the peninsulas of Paria and Araya, the islands of Trinidad and Margarita and traveled along the continental coast, always in search of a passage towards India. The flotilla then sailed along the Paraguaná Peninsula and sighted the island of Curacao, which was named &quot;Giants Island&quot; as the indigenous people that were seen were thought to be giants. During the same journey, he constructed a ship and visited the islands of Aruba and the Las Aves archipelago.

During the voyage along the Paraguaná Peninsula, the flotilla entered into a gulf (Gulf of Venezuela) where there were villages of the Wayuu people with palafito houses built over the water and supported on stilts made from tree trunks. These villages are said to have reminded Amerigo Vespucci of the city of Venice, (), and so the area was given the name &quot;Venezuela&quot; meaning &quot;Little Venice&quot;. (However, according to Martín Fernández de Enciso, who supported Ojeda&#x27;s 1509 expedition, they found a local population calling themselves the &quot;Veneciuela&quot;, so &quot;Venezuela&quot; may derive from the local term.) The flotilla arrived at the entrance to Lake Maracaibo on 24 August 1499. The lake was originally named after Saint Bartholomew as this was his saints day. Ojeda also reached Cabo de la Vela, on the Guajira Peninsula, which he named &quot;Coquivacoa&quot;.

A few days later the expedition left Cabo de la Vela for Hispaniola with some pearls obtained in Paria, a little gold and several slaves. The scarcity of goods and slaves resulted in a poor economic return for investors in the expedition. However, the importance of the voyage comes from the fact that it was the first detailed reconnaissance of the coast of Venezuela and that Spanish explorers carried it out. Following Columbus&#x27;s third voyage Ojeda is credited with leading the second European expedition to have visited Venezuela, and the first to have visited Colombia. The expedition also gave Juan de la Cosa the chance to draw the first known map of the area now known as Venezuela, as well as being possibly the first journey that Vespucci made to the New World.

However, when the expedition arrived in Hispaniola on 5 September the followers of Christopher Columbus were angry because they considered that Ojeda was infringing upon Columbus&#x27;s exploring privileges. This resulted in brawls and fights between both groups, which left many dead and wounded. Ojeda took many captives back to Spain whom he sold as slaves. Even so, the voyage was not financially successful, netting some fifteen thousand maravedis in profit to be divided among the fifty-five crew members surviving from the original three hundred. Note, that since forty maravedis per day was an average wage for skilled labor at this time, they could have made more money staying at home. Returning on the heels of Pedro Alonso Nino&#x27;s smaller but far more lucrative voyage magnified this disappointment. The date of return is disputed: it is usually stated that Ojeda returned in June 1500 but the historian Demetrio Ramos has suggested the earlier date of November 1499.

== Second voyage to Venezuela ==

Ojeda decided to make another journey and he received a new commission from the Catholic Monarchs on 8 June 1501. He was appointed Governor of Coquivacoa behind the back of Christopher Columbus. This appointment gave him the right to found a colony in this area, although he was advised not to visit Paria. On this occasion he formed a partnership with the Andalusian merchants Juan de Vergara and García de Campos, who were able to charter four caravels: the &quot;Santa María de la Antigua&quot;, the &quot;Santa María de la Grenada&quot;, the &quot;Magdalena&quot;, and the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;.

Ojeda set sail from Spain in January 1502 and he followed the same route as his first voyage. On this occasion, he kept his distance from the Gulf of Paria and made landfall on Margarita Island where, according to some sources, he tried to obtain gold and pearls from the indigenous people using several different methods. He sailed along the coast of Venezuela from Curiana to the Paraguaná Peninsula. On 3 May 1502, he founded a colony on the Guajira Peninsula, at Bahia Honda. The colony was called &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; and it was the first Spanish settlement on Colombian territory and therefore the first on the American mainland.

However, the colony did not last for more than three months, as the new arrivals started attacking the indigenous villages in the area, causing constant conflict with them. In addition to this, there were personal difficulties between Ojeda and his men. At this point, Vergara and Campos took Ojeda prisoner and abandoned the settlement with the small amount of plunder that had been captured. Ojeda was put in prison in Hispaniola in May 1502, where he was held until 1504. He was released following an appeal made by Archbishop Rodríguez de Fonseca, although he had to pay a costly indemnity, which left him with little money.

The second voyage was, therefore, a failure as he had not discovered any new areas and he had not received much of a share of the plunder obtained by Vergara and Campos. Besides, the Santa Cruz colony was abandoned and the Governorship of Coquivacoa was abolished.

== Third voyage to New Andalusia ==
On regaining his freedom Ojeda remained in Hispaniola for four years with little to do. (Some authors think that, on his release from prison, Ojeda returned to Spain.) Then in 1508 he learned that King Ferdinand the Catholic was interviewing people interested in colonizing and governing the section of mainland between the capes of Cabo Gracias a Dios (on the border between present-day Honduras and Nicaragua) and Cabo de la Vela in present-day Colombia. Juan de la Cosa went to Spain to represent Ojeda at court. One of Ojeda&#x27;s rivals was Diego de Nicuesa.

Both candidates had good reputations and sympathizers at court, so the King decided to divide the region into two governorates: Veragua to the west and New Andalusia to the east as far as the Gulf of Urabá. The former was awarded to Nicuesa and the latter to Ojeda in a commission signed in 1508.

The new governors repaired to Santo Domingo to prepare the expeditionary flotillas. There was a great disparity between the two flotillas. As Nicuesa was wealthier and had better credit with the colonial authorities he was able to attract 800 men, many horses, five caravels and two brigs. While Ojeda&#x27;s flotilla only consisted of a little more than 300 men, two brigs and two smaller ships. Among those who embarked on these four vessels was Francisco Pizarro, the future conqueror of Peru. Hernán Cortés, who was later to dominate Mexico, would have been among the soldiers of fortune engaged in this adventure, had a sudden illness, preventing him from sailing. Due to the disputes regarding the extent of each of the two governorates, Juan de la Cosa decided that the River Atrato would form the boundary between the two regions.

Ojeda promised to make the wealthy lawyer Martín Fernández de Enciso mayor of the new colony that Ojeda planned to establish in New Andalusia. Encisco was ordered to follow on after the main flotilla with a chartered boat and more provisions. The main flotilla finally set sail from Santo Domingo on 10 November 1509, a few days ahead of Nicuesa.

The flotilla arrived at Bahia de Calamar in present-day Cartagena (Colombia). This was against the wishes of De la Cosa who did not want to land in the area. After disembarking with about 70 men Ojeda encountered some indigenous tribes. He then sent out missionaries and interpreters to read out the proclamation that had been drafted by Palacios Rubios. The indigenous people were upset by this proclamation and so Ojeda tried to placate them by offering them trinkets. At this time the Spanish were also raiding villages to capture Indians for slaves. An eyewitness account recorded by historian Bartolomé de las Casas notes, &quot;The Spaniards worked an incredible slaughter on that village, they spared no one, women, children, babies or not. Then they robbed.&quot; These actions so provoked the indigenous people that they started to fight against the Spanish settlers. Ojeda defeated the natives in the coastal area and on pursuing some of the survivors who had escaped into the jungle he came upon the village of Turbaco. The Spanish were then taken by surprise by a counterattack. Nearly the entire party were wiped out in the battle and Juan de la Cosa sacrificed his life so that Ojeda could escape. Only one other Spanish soldier survived the battle and he and Ojeda fled back to the coast where they were rescued by the ships anchored in the bay.

Nicuesa arrived with his flotilla soon after and, worried by Ojeda&#x27;s losses, he gave him arms and men. The two men then forgot their differences and joined forces to seek revenge on the people of Turbaco, who were massacred to a man.

== Governor of Nueva Andalucía and Urabá ==

Nicuesa then left for Veragua while Ojeda continued traveling along the coast of Nueva Andalucía toward the southwest. On 20 January 1510 he founded the settlement of San Sebastián de Urabá, which in reality was little more than a fort.

However, the fort soon grew short of food, which exacerbated the problems caused by the unhealthy climate and the constant threat of attack by the local tribes who attacked the Spaniards with poisoned arrows. Ojeda was wounded in the leg by one such attack.

Eight months after the flotilla left Santo Domingo the assistance promised by Fernández de Enciso still had not arrived. Francisco Pizarro was placed in charge of the fort and ordered to stay there for the fifty days that it would take for Ojeda to travel to and return from Santo Domingo. However, Ojeda never returned to San Sebastian and after the fifty days, Pizarro decided to leave the colony in the two brigs along with the 70 colonists. A little later Fernández de Enciso, along with Vasco Núñez de Balboa, arrived to assist the survivors. The indigenous people who lived in the area later burnt down the fort.

Ojeda eventually returned to Santo Domingo in the brig of a Spanish pirate called Bernardino de Talavera who was fleeing from Hispaniola and passed by the port.

== Shipwrecked in Cuba ==

When Ojeda returned to Santo Domingo he was accompanied by seventy men and he was seeking help. However, the pirate took Ojeda prisoner and would not set him free. At this point, a powerful hurricane struck the boat and Talavera had to seek help from Ojeda. Despite their efforts, the ship was shipwrecked at Jagua, Sancti Spíritus, in the south of Cuba. Ojeda decided to travel along the coast on foot with Talavera and his men to reach Maisí Point from where they would be able to get to Hispaniola.

However, the party faced several difficulties en route and half of the men died of hunger, illness or other hardships that they met along the way. The sole possession remaining to Ojeda was an image of the Virgin Mary, which he had carried with him since he left Spain. He made a promise on this image that he would build a church dedicated to her in the first village that he reached where he was given hospitality.

A little later, and with only a dozen men and the pirate Talavera still surviving, he arrived in the district of Cueybá where the chief Cacicaná provided food and shelter. Ojeda was true to his word and he built a small hermitage to the Virgin in the village, which was venerated by the local people. The party was rescued by Pánfilo de Narváez and taken to Jamaica, where Talavera was imprisoned for piracy. From Jamaica Ojeda returned to Hispaniola where he learned that Fernández de Enciso had been able to relieve the colonists who had stayed in San Sebastián.

== Later life and death ==

After the failure of his journey to Nueva Andalucía, Ojeda did not mount any further expeditions and he renounced his position as governor. He lived out the last five years of his life in Santo Domingo. He later withdrew to the Monasterio de San Francisco where he died in 1515. Las Casas records of his death, that &quot;He died sick and poor, he didn&#x27;t have a cent to bury him, I think, for all the pearls, the gold he had … stolen from the Indians, for all the slaves he had made of them the times he hit the mainland. He willed himself to be buried (beneath) the door of the … monastery of St. Francis...&quot; This was so that all the visitors to the monastery would walk over his grave as a penance for all the errors that he had committed during his life.

His remains were moved to the former Convento Dominico. The excavations also found the remains of Bartholomew Columbus.

==Legacy==
Ciudad Ojeda, a city on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, is named in his honor.

The Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez tells the story of the life of the conquistador in his novel &quot;El Caballero de la Virgen&quot; (1929).

Also the Spanish writer Alberto Vázquez-Figueroa tells the story of Ojeda&#x27;s life in his novel &quot;Centauros&quot; (2007).

<doc id="758727" wikidata="Q3064607" url="?curid=758727" title="Charged particle beam">
<text>A charged particle beam is a spatially localized group of electrically charged particles that have approximately the same position, kinetic energy (resulting in the same velocity), and direction. The kinetic energies of the particles are much larger than the energies of particles at ambient temperature. The high energy and of charged particle beams make them useful for many applications in particle physics (see Particle beam#Applications and Electron-beam technology).

Such beams can be split into two main classes:
# &quot;unbunched beams&quot; (&quot;coasting beams&quot; or &quot;DC beams&quot;), which have no longitudinal substructure in the direction of beam motion. 
# &quot;bunched beams&quot;, in which the particles are distributed into pulses (bunches) of particles. Bunched beams are most common in modern facilities, since the most modern particle accelerators require bunched beams for acceleration.

Assuming a normal distribution of particle positions and impulses, a charged particle beam (or a bunch of the beam) is characterized by
* the species of particle, e.g. electrons, protons, or atomic nuclei
* the mean energy of the particles, often expressed in electronvolts (typically keV to GeV)
* the (average) particle current, often expressed in amperes
* the particle beam size, often using the so-called &quot;β-function&quot;
* the beam emittance, a measure of the area occupied by the beam in one of several phase spaces.

These parameters can be expressed in various ways. For example, the current and beam size can be combined into the current density, and the current and energy (or beam voltage V) can be combined into the perveance &quot;K&quot; = &quot;I&quot; &quot;V&quot;−3/2.

The charged particle beams that can be manipulated in particle accelerators can be subdivided into electron beams, ion beams and proton beams.

==Common types==
* Electron beam, or cathode ray, such as in a scanning electron microscope or in accelerators such as the Large Electron–Positron Collider or synchrotron light sources.
* Proton beam, such as the beams used in proton therapy, at colliders such as the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider, or for proton beam writing in lithography.
* Ion beams, such as at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider or the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.

<doc id="758728" wikidata="Q5367855" url="?curid=758728" title="Katsuo Okazaki">
<text>was a Japanese diplomat, politician and sportsman. He served as the Japanese foreign minister in the 1950s. He was also the final – and only Japanese – chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

==Early life==

Okazaki was born on 10 July 1897 in Kanagawa, Japan. He was the 10th son of Yasunosuke Okazaki. He studied law at the University of Tokyo and then joined the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==Sporting prowess==

Okazaki participated in the 1924 Paris Olympic Summer Games, qualifying for the 5,000 m final with a time of 15.22.2e. In the final, he fainted in the heatwave and was carried away by medics. He had much success at the Far Eastern Championship Games, winning the mile run at the 1921 Games then doing a middle-distance double in the mile and 880 yards at the 1923 event in Osaka.

==Consular positions==
Okasaki served as second secretary to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. in the early 1930s.

He also served in numerous positions in China during the 1930s, including serving as Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing after the Fall of Nanking to the Imperial Japanese Army and during the Nanking Massacre. In 1938, he was serving as Japanese Consul General in Canton. In October 1939 was appointed Japanese Consul at Hong Kong, a position he held until January 1941.

==Shanghai Municipal Council==

In early January 1942 Okazaki was appointed as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council after the British and American members resigned following the commencement of the Pacific War and the occupation of the Shanghai International Settlement by Japanese troops. After the resignation of the Commissioner General, G. Godfrey Phillips which took effect from 1 March 1942, Okasaki also took over the role of Commissioner General in an honorary capacity. He served until 1943 when the council was disbanded.

==Surrender of Japan==
Okazaki took part in the surrender negotiations between the Japanese emissaries and American military officials on Iejima in 1945. He was present as a representative of Japan at the formal surrender on 2 September 1945 aboard the .

==Post-war political and diplomatic career==

Okazaki was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives in 1949. In 1951, he was appointed by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida as Chief Cabinet Secretary and state minister without portfolio.

In 1952, he was appointed Foreign Minister and served in that position until 1954. In 1954, building on work by Ikeda, Okazaki signed a Mutual Security Assistance (MSA) Agreement with U.S. Ambassador John Allison.

In 1961 he was called out of retirement to serve in the United Nations in what was described at the time as a move to strengthen the Japanese delegation. He served as Japan&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations from April 1961 to July 1963.

==Death==

Okazaki died on 10 October 1965 in Tokyo of a stomach ulcer at the age of 68.

==Family members==

Okazaki was married to Shimako with whom he had a son, Taro, and a daughter, Yoshiko.

He is the grandfather of the Japanese-American figure skater Kyoko Ina, Yoshiko&#x27;s daughter.

<doc id="758730" wikidata="Q5358163" url="?curid=758730" title="Electron-beam technology">
<text>Since the mid-20th century, electron-beam technology has provided the basis for a variety of novel and specialized applications in semiconductor manufacturing, microelectromechanical systems, nanoelectromechanical systems, and microscopy.

==Mechanism==
Free electrons in a vacuum can be manipulated by electric and magnetic fields to form a fine beam. Where the beam collides with solid-state matter, electrons are converted into heat or kinetic energy. This concentration of energy in a small volume of matter can be precisely controlled electronically, which brings many advantages.

==Applications==
The rapid increase of temperature at the location of impact can quickly melt a target material. In extreme working conditions, the rapid temperature increase can even lead to evaporation, making an electron beam an excellent tool in heating applications, such as welding. Electron beam technology is used in cable-isolation treatment, in electron lithography of sub-micrometer and nano-dimensional images, in microelectronics for electron-beam curing of color printing and for the fabrication and modification of polymers, including liquid-crystal films, among many other applications.

===Furnaces===

In a vacuum, the electron beam provides a source of heat that can melt or modify any material. This source of heat or phase transformation is absolutely sterile due to the vacuum and scull of solidified metal around the cold copper crucible walls. This ensures that the purest materials can be produced and refined in electron-beam vacuum furnaces. Rare and refractory metals can be produced or refined in small-volume vacuum furnaces. For mass production of steels, large furnaces with capacity measured in metric tons and electron-beam power in megawatts exist in industrialized countries.

===Welding===

Since the beginning of electron-beam welding on an industrial scale at the end of the 1950s, countless electron-beam welders have been designed and are being used worldwide. These welders feature working vacuum chambers ranging from a few liters up to hundreds of cubic meters, with electron guns carrying power of up to 100 kW.

===Surface treatments===
Modern electron-beam welders are usually designed with a computer-controlled deflection system that can traverse the beam rapidly and accurately over a selected area of the work piece. Thanks to the rapid heating, only a thin surface layer of the material is heated. Applications include hardening, annealing, tempering, texturing, and polishing (with argon gas present). If the electron beam is used to cut a shallow trough in the surface, repeatedly moving it horizontally along the trough at high speeds creates a small pile of ejected melted metal. With repetition, spike structures of up to a millimeter in height can be created. These structures can aid bonding between different materials and modify the surface roughness of the metal.

===Additive manufacturing===

Additive manufacturing is the process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually by melting powder material layer upon layer. Melting in a vacuum by using a computer-controlled scanning electron beam is highly precise. Electron-beam direct manufacturing (DM) is the first commercially available, large-scale, fully programmable means of achieving near net shape parts.

===Metal powder production===
The source billet metal is melted by an electron beam while being spun vigorously. Powder is produced as the metal cools when flying off the metal bar.

===Machining===

Electron-beam machining is a process in which high-velocity electrons are concentrated into a narrow beam with a very high planar power density. The beam cross-section is then focused and directed toward the work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Electron-beam machining can be used to accurately cut or bore a wide variety of metals. The resulting surface finish is better and kerf width is narrower than what can be produced by other thermal cutting processes. However, due to high equipment costs, the use of this technology is limited to high-value products.

===Lithography===

An electron lithograph is produced by a very finely focused electron beam, which creates micro-structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching. It was originally developed for manufacturing integrated circuits and is also used for creating nanotechnology architectures. Electron lithographs uses electron beams with diameters ranging from two nanometers up to hundreds of nanometers. The electron lithograph is also used to produce computer-generated holograms (CGH). Maskless electron lithography has found wide usage in photomask making for photolithography, low-volume production of semiconductor components, and research and development activities.

===Physical-vapor-deposition solar-cell production===
Physical vapor deposition takes place in a vacuum and produces a thin film of solar cells by depositing thin layers of metals onto a backing structure. 
Electron-beam evaporation uses thermionics emission to create a stream of electrons that are accelerated by a high-voltage cathode and anode arrangement. Electrostatic and magnetic fields focus and direct the electrons to strike a target. The kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy at or near the surface of the material. The resulting heating causes the material to melt and then evaporate. Temperatures in excess of 3500 degrees Celsius can be reached. The vapor from the source condenses onto a substrate, creating a thin film of high-purity material. Film thicknesses from a single atomic layer to many micrometers can be achieved. This technique is used in microelectronics, optics, and material research, and to produce solar cells and many other products.

===Curing and sterilization===

Electron-beam curing is a method of curing paints and inks without the need for traditional solvent. Electron-beam curing produces a finish similar to that of traditional solvent-evaporation processes, but achieves that finish through a polymerization process. E-beam processing is also used to cross-link polymers to make them more resistant to thermal, mechanical or chemical stresses.

E-beam processing has been used for the sterilization of medical products and aseptic packaging materials for foods, as well as disinfestation, the elimination of live insects from grain, tobacco, and other unprocessed bulk crops.

===Electron microscopes===

An electron microscope uses a controlled beam of electrons to illuminate a specimen and produce a magnified image. Two common types are the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM).

===Medical Radiation Therapy===
Electron beams impinging on metal produce X-rays. The X-rays may be diagnostic, e.g., dental or limb images. Often in these X-ray tubes the metal is a spinning disk so that it doesn&#x27;t melt; the disk is spun in vacuum via a magnetic motor. The X-rays may also be used to kill cancerous tissue. The Therac-25 machine is an infamous example of this.

<text>The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are a complex of one United States national park and three California state parks located along the coast of northern California. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. The parks&#x27; 139,000 acres (560 km2) preserve 45 percent of all remaining old-growth coast redwood forests.

Located in Del Norte and Humboldt counties, the four parks protect the endangered coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;)—the tallest, among the oldest, and one of the most massive tree species on Earth—which thrives in the humid temperate rainforest. The park region is highly seismically active and prone to tsunamis. The parks preserve 37 miles (60 km) of pristine coastline, indigenous flora, fauna, grassland prairie, cultural resources, waterways, as well as threatened animal species, such as the Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller&#x27;s sea lion. 

Redwood forest originally covered more than two million acres (8,100 km2) of the California coast, and the region of today&#x27;s parks largely remained wild until after 1850. The gold rush and attendant timber business unleashed a torrent of European-American activity, pushing Native Americans aside and supplying lumber to the West Coast. Decades of unrestricted clear-cut logging ensued, followed by ardent conservation efforts. In the 1920s, the Save the Redwoods League helped create Prairie Creek, Del Norte Coast, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks among others. After lobbying from the league and the Sierra Club, Congress created Redwood National Park in 1968 and expanded it in 1978. In 1994, the National Park Service (NPS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation combined Redwood National Park with the three abutting Redwoods State Parks into a single administrative unit. Modern RNSP management seeks to both protect and restore the coast redwood forests to their condition before 1850, including by controlled burning.

In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the United Nations designated them a World Heritage Site in 1980. Local tribes declared an Indigenous Marine Stewardship Area in 2023, protecting the parks region, the coastline, and coastal waters. Park admission is free except for special permits, and visitors may camp, hike, bike, and ride horseback along about of park system trails.

==History==

===Native Americans===

Modern-day Native American nations such as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karuk, Chilula, and Wiyot have historical ties to the region, which has had various indigenous occupants for millennia. Describing &quot;a diversity in an area that size that has probably has never been equaled anywhere else in the world&quot;, historian David Stannard accounts for more than thirty native nations that lived in northwestern California. Scholar Gail L. Jenner estimates that &quot;at least fifteen&quot; tribal groups inhabited the coastline.

The Yurok, Chilula, and Tolowa were the most connected to the current parks&#x27; areas. Based on an 1852 census, anthropologist Alfred Kroeber estimated that the Yurok population in that year was around 2,500. Historian Ed Bearss described the Yurok as the most populous in the area, estimating that there were around 55 villages. Until the 1860s, the Chilula lived in the middle region of the Redwood Creek valley in close company with the redwood trees. They primarily settled along Redwood Creek between the coast and Minor Creek, California, and in summer they would range into and camp in the Bald Hills. The Tolowa were located near the Smith River, and on lands that are now part of Jedediah Smith State Park, an area which 21st century excavation found has been inhabited for at least 8,500 years.

Native Americans residing within the park areas relied on redwood trees as a construction material, and some featured the trees in their mythology, including the Chilula, who viewed the trees as gifts from a creator. The tribes harvested coast redwoods and processed them into planks, using them as building material for boats, houses, and small villages. To construct buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions lashed with willow or hazel and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a two- or three-pitch roof.
===Arrival of European Americans===
Historians believe that the first Europeans to visit land near what is now the parks were members of the Cabrillo expedition led by Bartolomé Ferrer. In 1543, Ferrer&#x27;s ship made landfall at Cape Mendocino and may have reached waters off Oregon as far north as the 43rd parallel. Hubert Howe Bancroft disagreed, believing that Ferrer&#x27;s ship did not travel so far north. Explorers including Francis Drake sailed past the foggy, rocky coast, but generally did not set anchor until 1775, when Bruno de Heceta and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra of Spain spent about ten days at the Yurok village of Tsurai south of the parks. George Vancouver and Francisco de Eliza followed in 1793. American fur trading ships under contract to Russians stopped at Tsurai during the early 19th century.

Prior to Jedediah Smith in 1828, no other explorer of European descent is known to have explored the interior of the Northern California coastal region. Smith and nineteen companions left San Jose, California, and explored what are now called the Trinity, Smith, and Klamath rivers, passing through coast redwood forests and trading with Native American groups. They reached the coast near Requa, parts of which are within the parks&#x27; boundaries.

The California Gold Rush of 1848 brought hundreds of thousands of Europeans and Americans to California, and the discovery of gold along the Trinity River in 1850 brought many of them to the region of the parks. This quickly led to conflicts wherein native peoples were displaced, raped, enslaved, and massacred. By 1895, only one third of the Yurok in one group of villages remained; by 1919, virtually all members of the Chilula tribe had either died or been assimilated into other tribes. The Tolowa—whose numbers Bearss estimates at &quot;well under 1,000&quot; by the 1850s—had a population of about 120 in 1910, having been nearly extinguished in massacres by settlers between 1853 and 1855.

Redwood logging followed gold mining, and most mining companies became lumber interests. Redwood has a straight grain, making planks easy to cut. Because redwood can defy the weather and does not warp, it became a valuable commodity. Jenner says a good team of two men could saw through a redwood tree at about a foot per hour with a crosscut saw, their preferred tool until after World War II. Because wheeled vehicles could not travel the landscape, teams of six or twelve oxen transported logs to logging roads. Rivers or railroads took them to the region&#x27;s lumber mills. After the 1881 invention of the steam donkey and later its successor the bull donkey, the need to fell intervening trees so the donkeys could work spawned the practice called clearcutting. Caterpillar tractors began to compete with manual labor in the late 1920s.

===State park preservation===
After extensive logging, conservationists and concerned citizens began to seek ways to preserve remaining trees, which they saw being logged at an alarming rate. Stumbling blocks slowed conservation: objections and some innovations came from the logging industry, construction of the Redwood Highway brought roadside attractions and more visitors to the trees, Congress failed to act, and voracious demand for lumber came with the post-World War II construction boom.

Organizations formed to preserve the surviving trees: concerned about the sequoia of Yosemite, John Muir cofounded the Sierra Club in 1892. The Sempervirens Club was cofounded in 1900 by artist Andrew P. Hill who lobbied the media, and saw the oldest state park created along with the California state park system. In 1916, politician William Kent purchased land outright and helped to write the bill founding the National Park Service (NPS). In 1918, John Merriam and other members of the Boone and Crockett Club founded the Save the Redwoods League. The league bought land and donated funds for land purchases. Historian Susan Schrepfer writes that, in a sixty-year-long marathon, the Save the Redwoods League and the Sierra Club were racing the logging companies for the old trees.

At first, in 1919, with Congress showing interest but no appropriations, NPS director Stephen Mather formed the NPS system with private wealth—he and his wealthy friends purchased parkland with their own money. Balancing opponents and supporters, the Save the Redwoods League saw their compromise bill pass in 1923, allowing condemnation for park acquisition with state oversight. In 1925, the league backed a bill that would authorize a statewide survey by a landscape architect and permit land acquisition and condemnation for parks. In 1926, the league retained Frederick Law Olmsted to make that survey. The league added to their bill a proposed state constitutional amendment authorizing up to $6 million in bonds to equally match private donations for state land purchases. After sustaining a governor&#x27;s veto in 1925, the league broadened its efforts to include the whole state, mounted a publicity campaign, and gained the support of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. A new governor signed the parks bill into law in 1927, a bond issue was approved in the 1928 election.

In 1927, Olmsted&#x27;s survey was complete and concluded that only three percent of the state&#x27;s redwoods could be preserved. He recommended four redwood areas for parks, including three areas that became Prairie Creek Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks. A fourth became Humboldt Redwoods State Park, by far the largest of the individual Redwoods State Parks, but not in the Redwood National and State Parks system. Now armed with matching funds after 1928, the league bought more land and added to these parks as conditions allowed.

===National park===
The NPS proposed a redwoods national park in 1938. The Save the Redwoods League opposed it, highlighting a division between preservationists who preferred unembellished nature and a segment of the park service who wished to provide recreation and playgrounds for the public. Both the league and the Sierra Club wanted a redwoods national park by the 1960s, but the club and the league supported different locations. The club and the league were antagonists during the 1960s, often on opposite sides of national park arguments, until 1971 when the league backed a club position, and the late 1970s when the league became a club member.

The Sierra Club wanted the largest possible park and usually sought help from the federal government. More cautious, the Save the Redwoods League tended to accommodate industry and support the state of California. When the agency had no funds in 1963, the National Geographic Society funded an NPS survey of the redwoods. In 1964, NPS released its ideas for three different sized redwood national parks. In 1964, Congress passed the Land and Water Conservation Fund to allow federal funds to purchase parkland.

Describing a reason for the club&#x27;s success, Willard Pratt of the Arcata lumber company wrote, &quot;The Sierra Club demonstrated a basic political fact of life: Opposition to particular preservation proposals usually is local while support is national. If decision making can be placed at the national level, preservation usually can win&quot;.

Initially opposing the park in the 1960s, the Arcata, Georgia-Pacific, and Miller lumber businesses operated up to the boundaries being discussed. In 1965, five logging companies formally objected to any redwood national park. Schrepfer writes that the final bill divided the impact between the lumber companies, between California counties, and tried to appeal to both the league and the club. Schrepfer says that in large part, the bill was framed on the loggers&#x27; terms. After intense lobbying of Congress, the bill creating Redwood National Park was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in October 1968.

The Save the Redwoods League donated parcels in 1974 and 1976. The club found the Olmsted plan of delicately choosing sites was the wrong approach to defend against tractor clearcutting. In 1977, the club said that only ridge-to-ridge land acquisition around a water channel could preserve a watershed and thus the trees. Amidst both local support of environmentalists and opposition from local loggers and logging companies, were added to Redwood National Park in an expansion signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978. The purchase included lands that had already been logged, and the NPS was charged with restoring the land and reducing soil erosion. At hundreds of millions of dollars, it was the most expensive land purchase ever approved by Congress. By 1979, the league had preserved , nearly twice the area that the federal government was able to save with park legislation.

===Further recognition===

The United Nations designated the Redwood National and State Parks a World Heritage Site in 1980. The evaluation committee noted cooperative management and ongoing research in the parks by Cal Poly Humboldt University and other partners. The parks are within the California Coast Ranges and their resources are considered irreplaceable. In 1983, the parks were designated an International Biosphere Reserve. In 2017, the US withdrew them along with more than a dozen other reserves from the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

In 2023, following the lead of First Nations in Canada and Aboriginal people in Australia, three federally recognized indigenous tribes—the Resighini Rancheria of the Yurok People, Tolowa Dee-ni&#x27; Nation, and Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria—announced that as sovereign governments they have protected the Yurok-Tolowa-Dee-ni&#x27; Indigenous Marine Stewardship Area. The effort protected of territorial ocean waters and coastline reaching from Oregon to just south of Trinidad, California, and contributed to the California 30x30 plan to conserve 30 percent of the state&#x27;s land and coastal water by 2030. The tribes invited cooperation with US agencies and other indigenous nations.

==Park management==
Redwood National Park is directly managed by the NPS from its office in Crescent City, California. The three state parks are overseen by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. The park management coordinates with tribal leaders, as the parks contain land and village sites belonging to groups including the Yurok and Tolowa. NPS manages about of federal park land and waters that lie within the Yurok Indian Reservation.

Redwood National Park management oversees many other details aside from the redwoods and organic species that reside within the park boundaries. They regulate areas that are off limits to motor vehicles, boats, drones, horses, pets and even bicycles. In addition, park management establishes limitations on camping, campfires, food storage and backcountry use, as well as necessary permits.

When it opened in 1969, Redwood National Park had six permanent employees. As of 2023, the combined RNSP had 96 permanent and 52 temporary staff members. Early park managers prioritized restoring existing structures, rehabilitating the watershed, and developing wildlife management plans. Until 1980, managers assumed that the three state parks, which are contained within the boundaries of the national park, would be donated to the NPS. The donation did not happen, and NPS and the state signed a memorandum of understanding in 1994 governing joint management, and agreeing to the name &quot;Redwood National and State Parks&quot;. As of 2021, the combined RNSP had 1,185,000 annual visitors.

==Natural resources==
The Redwood National and State Parks conserve an area which contains the largest contiguous old-growth coast redwood forest as well as habitats for endangered species.

===Coast redwood===

Discovered in Redwood National Park in 2006 in an unpublished location, the tallest living tree is the coast redwood tree (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) named Hyperion, at . It is followed by Helios at , and Icarus at , both also in Redwood National Park. For many years thought to be the tallest, one specimen named simply &quot;Tall Tree&quot; in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park was measured at . &quot;So many people have stood on the base of the tree that the ground is hard packed&quot;, said Professor Stephen C. Sillett of Cal Poly Humboldt university in the 1990s. The top of the tree died in the 1970s and fell off in the 1990s. In 2022, after documenting damage caused by visitors to the tallest living tree, NPS announced a penalty for those who approach it of up to a $5,000 fine and six months in jail, and it shows visitors instead to views of other trees.

Mature coast redwoods live an average of 500–700 years; a few are documented to be 2,000 years old. As of 1990, a stand in nearby Humboldt Redwoods State Park had the greatest biomass ever recorded. Redwood trees develop enormous limbs that accumulate deep organic soils from which new tree-sized redwood trunks emerge and in which plants called &quot;epiphytes&quot; can grow. Mats of epiphytic ferns well above ground are home to invertebrates, mollusks, earthworms, and salamanders.

Redwoods prefer sheltered slopes, and they thrive on moist flat ground along rivers below in elevation. Coastal fog provides about 40 percent of their annual water intake. Redwoods have existed along the coast of northern California for at least 20 million years and are related to tree species that existed 160 million years ago in the Jurassic era. About 96 percent of the world&#x27;s old-growth coast redwood forest has been logged, and almost half (45 percent) of what remains is in the RNSP. The parks protect of old-growth forest, almost equally divided between federal and state management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature named the coast redwood an endangered species in 2011.

===Other flora===

Coast redwood tends to dominate in places it likes but often can be found together with also-fast-growing coast Douglas-fir trees. Closer to the ocean, red alder grow in place of the salt-water intolerant redwood. The tallest known Sitka spruce grows in the parks. Sitka spruce are plentiful along the coast, better adapted to salty air than other species. Other associated trees are the tanoak, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple, and California laurel.

Huckleberry and snowberry are part of the forest understory. The California rhododendron and azalea are flowering shrubs common in the parks. Plants such as the sword fern and redwood sorrel are prolific.

In Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Fern Canyon is a well-known ravine deep, with walls completely covered in ferns—California maidenhair, deer fern, California polypody, licorice fern, and western swordfern. The ancestors of some of these ferns reach back 325 million years.

===Fauna===

Various ecosystems exist within the parks—seacoast, river, prairie, and densely forested zones—offering refuge to numerous rare and endangered species. About 66 species of land mammals have been documented, including the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, and black-tailed deer. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now common in park areas. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including minks, martens, red squirrels, northern flying squirrels, shrews, moles, brush rabbit, gophers, and raccoons live in the parks, although small mammals are infrequently seen.

Inhabiting or ranging into the park are 28 species that are federally recognized as endangered, threatened, or candidates for protection; about a third of that number can be regularly seen in the parks. The bald eagle, which usually nests near a water source, is listed as a state of California endangered species. The Chinook salmon—historically an essential food for indigenous residents—northern spotted owl, and Steller&#x27;s sea lion are a few of the other animal species that are threatened. The tidewater goby is a federally listed endangered species that lives near the Pacific coastline that were extirpated from the parks in 1968 when shoreline alterations affected the water&#x27;s salinity. The candlefish soon followed in the 1970s. Sea otters were extirpated in the parks at the turn of the 20th century but river otters remain. Also endangered, the marbled murrelet can nest high on redwood branches.

Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals live near the shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Brown pelicans and three species of cormorants are mainly found on cliffs along the coast and on seastacks, while sandpipers and three species of gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, red-tailed hawk, herons, and jays are a few of the bird species that have been documented. Approximately 280 bird species, or about one third of those found in the US, have been documented within park boundaries.

Reptiles like four species of sea turtle can be found offshore and sometimes on beaches. Amphibians can be found in the parks, which the gopher snake, tailed frog, clouded salamander, and three species of newts call home. Well-known detritivores, the banana slug and the yellow-spotted millipede, inhabit the parks.

===Invasive species===
Over 200 exotic species live in the RNSP. Of these, 30 have been identified as invasive species, and 10 of the 30 are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for about a quarter of the total flora in the parks. Growing in varying amounts over the parks&#x27; different vegetation areas, about one percent of plants in old-growth areas are exotic species, compared to 50 to 75 percent in the Bald Hills prairies. Spotted knapweed and poison hemlock were both under consideration in 2015 for addition to a high-priority watch list maintained by the park system.

===Geography===
The parks are located in the most seismically active area in the country. Frequent minor earthquakes in the park and offshore under the Pacific Ocean have resulted in shifting river channels, landslides, and erosion of seaside cliffs. The North American, Pacific, and Gorda Plates are tectonic plates that all meet at the Mendocino triple junction, about southwest of the parks. During the 1990s, more than nine magnitude 6.0 earthquakes occurred along this fault zone. More recently, a 6.4 magnitude quake in 2022 with a hypocenter off the coast caused two deaths. Visitors&#x27; centers closed but the parks remained open. The area is the most tsunami-prone in the continental US, and visitors to the seacoast are told to seek higher ground immediately after any significant earthquake. The parks&#x27; altitude ranges from below sea level up to at Rodgers Peak.

Both coastline and the mountains of the California Coast Ranges can be found within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks are part of the Franciscan assemblage. Assemblage metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, along with marine and alluvial sedimentary deposits of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods, are underneath the Redwood Creek basin. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, and shale, with lesser amounts of chert, greenstone, and metamorphic rocks.

===Climate ===
The Redwood National and State Parks have a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). They receive abundant rain during most of the year, with a peak in winter, a decrease in June and September, and two dry summer months (July and August).
The parks are part of a temperate rainforest that runs along the western United States coast. The nearby Pacific Ocean has major effects on the climate in the parks. Temperatures near the coast mostly remain between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (4–15 °C) all year. Redwoods tend to grow in this area of steadily temperate climate, though most grow at least a mile or two (1.5–3 km) from the coast to avoid the saltier air, and they never grow more than from it. In this humid coastal zone, the trees receive moisture from both heavy winter rains and persistent summer fog. The presence and consistency of the summer fog is actually more important to overall health of the trees than the precipitation. This fact is borne out in precipitation totals of around annually, with healthy redwood forests throughout the areas of less precipitation because excessive needs for water are mitigated by the ever-present summer fog and the cooler temperatures it ensures. The rare snow falls mostly on the hills and mountains in and adjacent to the park.

Parts of the parks are threatened by climate change. Increasing average temperatures have led to reduced water quality, affecting the fish and other fauna, and rising sea levels threaten to damage park structures near the coast. The redwoods benefit from higher carbon levels and are resilient against temperature changes. Scientists fear climate change is likely to shift the range in which coast redwoods live to outside protected areas, and many have done research on assisted migration.
===Fire===

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is responsible for fire management in the redwoods state parks, and NPS manages fire in the national park.

Because coast redwood bark—in places up to a foot thick—has no resin, the trees are resistant to fire and will regrow after burning. The redwood forest is foggy, humid, not generally susceptible to fire, and lightning strikes among redwoods are rare, meaning that most fires are anthropogenic. A 2003 fire was an exception; a lightning storm started fires in least 274 California locations, including the Canoe Fire in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, which burned from September through October. By about 11 percent, old-growth coast redwoods have the greatest volume of fuels of any forest type.

After they arrived and until white settlers invaded their lands in the 1850s, the Tolowa people intentionally set low-intensity ground fires. Indigenous residents, including the Karuk and Tolowa, used fire to protect tanoak trees and their acorns, a primary food supply. Their fires improved their hunting grounds, reduced pests, and decreased the likelihood of larger fires. There is evidence that medium-intensity surface fire was set regularly in the area, but today, after decades of fire suppression and resulting increased fuel density, maximum-intensity crown fire has taken the place of surface fires when fire occurs. Near the tree&#x27;s crown, coast redwood bark may be less than one inch thick.

Since its founding in 1905, and especially with its policies of the 1930s, the US Forest Service (USFS) has for the most part defended both human settlements and timber companies against fire using wildfire suppression techniques intended to &quot;eliminate&quot; fire. Repealed in 1937, the 1850 California Act for the Government and Protection of Indians—for which the state apologized in 2019—provided that &quot;Any person was subject to fine or punishment if they set the prairie on fire, or refused to use proper exertions to extinguish the fire.&quot; Recognizing that fire has benefits, the service began in the 1970s to change policy to allow fire to burn. More recently in the 2000s, USFS embraced indigenous fire management when USFS researcher Steve Norman advocated &quot;a modified Native American burning model&quot;.

In 2020, the Karuk tribe formed the Endowment for Eco-Cultural Revitalization to promote cultural burning in their homeland in the park region. Operating with a new perspective, park managers conduct controlled fires in the grassland areas of the parks—to control invasive species, hold back the spread of Douglas fir, and increase the availability of materials needed by local tribes for basket weaving.

==Recreation==
The parks have five visitor centers, where general information, maps, and souvenirs are available; some of the centers offer activities during the summer, led by park rangers. There is no entry fee for the RNSP, though some camping areas and park areas require paid passes.

Since the 2019 closure of the DeMartin Redwood Youth Hostel, a low-amenities shared lodging facility near Klamath, California,&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov/redw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; there are no hotels or motels within the parks&#x27; boundaries. About north of San Francisco, the parks are accessible by air, automobile, and public transit. NPS itself offers no lodging but for accommodations, links to each town from north to south along US 101: Brookings, Oregon, and in California, Crescent City, Klamath, Orick, Trinidad, McKinleyville, Arcata, Eureka, Ferndale, and the counties of Del Norte and Humboldt.

The state parks have four frontcountry campgrounds which can be accessed by vehicle and used for a fee; the parks&#x27; website suggests making a reservation. These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, which together have 231 campsites; the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, which has 75; and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 26. Other nearby parks and recreation areas have additional camping options.

Hiking is the only way to reach the seven backcountry camping areas, the use of which requires a permit. Camping is only allowed in designated sites, except on gravel bars along Redwood Creek that allow for dispersed camping. Proper food storage to minimize encounters with bears is strongly enforced, and hikers and backpackers are required to take out any trash they generate. The NPS subscribes to the seven principles of Leave No Trace.

Almost of hiking trails exist in the parks. Throughout the year, trails are often wet and hikers need to be well prepared for rainy weather and consult information centers for updates on trail conditions. Some temporary footbridges are removed during the rainy season, as they would be destroyed by high streams.

Horseback riding and mountain biking are allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is permitted, with ranger-led kayak tours offered during the summer. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Visitors can fish for salmon and trout in the Smith and Klamath rivers, and the beach areas offer opportunities to catch smelt and perch. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams.

<text>The Power Mac G4 is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1999 to 2004 as part of the Power Macintosh line. Built around the PowerPC G4 series of microprocessors, the Power Mac G4 was marketed by Apple as the first &quot;personal supercomputers&quot;, reaching speeds of 4 to 20 gigaFLOPS. This was the first existing Macintosh product to be officially shortened as &quot;Mac&quot; (with the exception of the iMac), and is the last Mac able to boot into classic Mac OS with the introduction of Mac OS X.

The enclosure style introduced with the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White) was retained through the entire five-year production run of the Power Mac G4, albeit with significant changes to match Apple&#x27;s evolving industrial design and to accommodate increasing cooling needs. The G4 and its enclosure were retired with the introduction of the Power Mac G5.

The Power Mac G4 is a line of personal computers. The tower form factor case is adapted from that of the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White), and features a latch on the side which can be used to open the side of the machine for easy access to the internals.

The machine is designed around PowerPC G4 processors, which feature faster processor speeds, larger caches and cache speed boosts from their G3 predecessors. The Power Mac G4 used chips that included a subprocessor called the Velocity Engine that performs functions such as video decoding that would otherwise be formed by slower, separate chips. Software must be written to specifically address the Velocity Engine.

External connectivity is provided by Universal Serial Bus and FireWire ports. Early models have options for adding AirPort wireless networking via an expansion card; this later came standard.

==Development==
After releasing the iMac, Apple adopted the translucent plastic computer&#x27;s visual style to its line of professional desktop computers with the &quot;Blue and White&quot; PowerPC G3-powered Power Macintosh G3. These machines featured a colorful design with curved handles for portability and a motherboard mounted on the side of computer for ease of access. They also began a migration away from legacy connectivity, such as SCSI, floppy disk drives, and Apple Desktop Bus to Universal Serial Bus and FireWire. While it was not as popular as the iMac, the Power Macintosh G3 sold well and kept Apple&#x27;s foothold in the more lucrative business market.

For the Power Mac G4, Apple kept the same design as the G3 it replaced, but came in a series of more sober case styling that presaged Apple&#x27;s use of aluminum that would become Apple&#x27;s trademark. The front panel switched from a blueberry color to gray (initially in a shade Apple called &quot;graphite&quot;), the formerly frosted white side panels became opaque silver, and the white handles became clear.

===Graphite models===
The original Power Mac G4 was introduced at the Seybold conference in San Francisco on August 31, 1999. While marketed as a single, unified product line, there were two variants of the machine. The first, cheaper configuration, the Power Macintosh G4 (PCI Graphics), served as an intermediate step between the Power Mac G3s and the G4 processors, used a G4 processor on a modified version of the Blue-and-white G3&#x27;s logic board, making them very similar to their predecessors. The higher-end configuration, Power Mac G4 (AGP Graphics), featured a new logic board and faster memory bandwidth, and swapped the PCI graphics-card slot for a faster Advanced Graphics Port slot.

Apple originally planned to ship the configuration in October 1999, but they were forced to postpone this because of poor yield of the CPUs. In response, Apple reduced the clock speed of the processor in each configuration by (making the options , and ), which caused some controversy because they did not lower the original prices accordingly.

The early (later ) PCI-based version used a motherboard identical to the one used in Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White) computers including the use of Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) processors sockets (minus the ADB port), in a &quot;graphite&quot; colored case and with the new Motorola PowerPC 7400 (G4) CPU. The higher-speed models, code name &quot;Sawtooth&quot;, used a greatly modified motherboard design with AGP 2x graphics (replacing the PCI slot).

The PCI variant was discontinued at the end of 1999.

The machines featured DVD-ROM drives as standard. The and versions had Zip drives as standard equipment, and as an option on the Sawtooth. This series had a system bus and four PC100 SDRAM slots for up to of RAM ( under Mac OS 9). The AGP Power Macs were the first to include an AirPort slot and DVI video port. The computers could house a total of three hard drives, two 128 GB ATA hard drives and up to a single 20 GB SCSI hard drive, with the installation of a SCSI card.

The version was reintroduced on February 16, 2000, accompanied by and models. DVD-RAM and Zip drives featured on these later and versions and were an option on the 400 MHz.

The Power Mac G4 (Gigabit Ethernet) model was introduced at Macworld Expo New York on July 19, 2000; the new revision included dual-processor and versions, and a low-end single CPU model. It was also the first personal computer to include gigabit Ethernet as standard. Most people saw this revision as a stopgap release, because higher clocked G4s were not available; the G4&#x27;s Motorola XPC107 &quot;Grackle&quot; PCI/Memory controller prevented the G4 from hitting speeds higher than . The dual models featured DVD-RAM optical drives. Zip drives were optional on all models. These models also introduced Apple&#x27;s proprietary Apple Display Connector video port.
=== Digital Audio/QuickSilver models ===
A new line with a revamped motherboard but retaining the familiar &quot;Graphite&quot; case debuted on January 9, 2001, known officially as the Power Mac G4 (Digital Audio). Motorola had added a seventh pipeline stage in the new PowerPC G4 design to achieve faster clock frequencies. New features included a fourth PCI slot, a 133 MHz system bus, an improved 4X AGP slot, and a new &quot;digital audio&quot; Tripath Class T amplifier sound system. The models were offered in , , dual , and configurations, the latter two using a newer PowerPC 7450 processor. The number of RAM slots was reduced to three, accommodating up to 1.5 Gigabytes of PC133 SDRAM.

The model was the first Macintosh to include a built-in DVD-R or Apple-branded SuperDrive, the rest of the line became the first Macs to ship with CD-RW drives.

At Macworld Expo New York on July 18, 2001, a new line debuted featuring a cosmetically redesigned case known as QuickSilver, and various upgrades to the specifications. It was available in , and dual configurations. The model was notable for not having a level three cache. The SuperDrive was offered on the mid-range model, and UltraATA/100 hard drives were offered on all models. The internal speaker received an upgrade, using a Harman/Kardon speaker.

The QuickSilver line received criticism in &quot;MacWorld&quot;″s review for removing the &quot;eject&quot; button and the manual eject pinhole, as well as the pass-through monitor power plug, and for the base specification of RAM as being insufficient for running Mac OS X.

The Quicksilver case went through shifts in hardware features and design up until production was due to start, resulting in a mismatch between the color of the plastic on the machine&#x27;s front doors and the rest of the case. Designer Doug Satzger recalled Steve Jobs was adamant that the issue be fixed before it shipped, despite pushback. Ive wanted special polished stainless steel screws in the handle of the case, which Jon Rubinstein vetoed as too expensive and delaying. Ive went around Rubenstein and got Jobs to approve the screws, though it created a widening rift between Ive and Rubinstein as Ive refused to compromise on his design vision.

Updated QuickSilver machines, officially named Power Mac G4 (QuickSilver 2002), were introduced on January 28, 2002, with , and dual configurations. This was the first Mac to reach . Again, the low-end model did not include any level three cache. The graphics in Updated QuickSilver machines were provided by an Nvidia GeForce4 Ti/MX or ATI Radeon 7500 graphics card. Some of these models have ATA controllers with 48-bit LBA to accommodate hard drives larger than 128 GB.
=== Mirrored Drive Doors models ===
Another generation of Apple Power Mac G4s, officially named &quot;Mirrored Drive Doors&quot; (MDD), was introduced on August 13, 2002, featuring both a new Xserve-derived DDR motherboard architecture and a new case design. All models were available in dual processor configurations running at , or . As with the Xserves, the PowerPC 7455 CPU used does not have a DDR frontside bus, meaning the CPU of the 133 MHz frontside bus models could use at most only 50% of the new system&#x27;s theoretical memory bandwidth, providing no improvement over previous models. The rest was available to the graphics card and I/O systems.

The early dual processor models generated more heat, and required more fans and larger heat sinks; the power supply fans were criticized for the increased noise, with third parties producing noise-reduction cases to dampen the sound in audio-sensitive environments. Apple released a firmware update to reduce fan noise and offered a fan and power supply exchange program.

The last real update to the Power Mac G4 line came on January 28, 2003, offering dual 1.42 GHz PowerPC 7455 processors, with features not seen in previous DDR models: a built-in FireWire 800 connector, optional integrated Bluetooth, and optional integrated AirPort Extreme. These were also the first Power Macs that could not boot into Mac OS 9.

With the launch of the Power Mac G5 on June 23, 2003, Apple re-introduced the August 2002 Power Mac G4 because of perceived demand for Mac OS 9 machines. Between that, its low price-tag, and the delayed availability of Power Mac G5s, it proved a strong seller, albeit for a relatively short time. Production stopped on June 27, 2004, and the remaining inventory was liquidated, its discontinuation ending the 20-year legacy of Classic Mac OS support.

<text>Seumas O&#x27;Kelly (1881 – 14 November 1918) was an Irish journalist, fiction writer, and playwright.

Born in Loughrea, County Galway, O&#x27;Kelly was educated locally and began his career as a journalist with the Cork newspaper &quot;Southern Star&quot;. He moved from &quot;The Southern Star&quot; to the &quot;Leinster Leader&quot; in Naas where he remained as Editor until he went to work in 1916 for &quot;Nationality&quot;, the Sinn Féin party newspaper. Michael O&#x27;Kelly, his more militant brother, took over at the &quot;Leader&quot; in 1912, but was interned after the April 1916 Easter Rising. Seumas returned to the &quot;Leader&quot; for a brief stint. There is a plaque in his honour outside the &quot;Leader&quot;&#x27;s offices which reads &quot;Seumas O&#x27;Kelly – a gentle revolutionary&quot;. He wrote numerous plays, short stories, and novels. His short story &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Grave&quot; is among the most acclaimed of Irish short stories. A radio version of this, adapted and produced by Mícheál Ó hAodha, won the Prix Italia for Radio Drama in 1961.

O&#x27;Kelly was a friend of the Irish nationalist Arthur Griffith, founder of both the political party Sinn Féin and its newspaper &quot;Nationality&quot;. He died prematurely of a heart attack following a raid on the paper&#x27;s headquarters at Harcourt St by British security forces.

<text>Count was a Japanese field marshal and leading figure in the early Imperial Japanese Army.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Kokura (in present-day Kitakyūshū) to a &quot;samurai&quot; family of the Kokura Domain in Buzen Province, Oku joined the military forces of the nearby Chōshū Domain during the First and Second Chōshū expeditions and the Boshin War in their struggle to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate and bring about the Meiji Restoration.

===Military career===
Appointed a commander of the new Imperial Japanese Army, Oku fought against the disgruntled samurai insurgents during the Saga Rebellion of 1871. He was later a survivor of the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. During the Satsuma Rebellion, he defended Kumamoto Castle during its siege as commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment.

During the First Sino-Japanese War Oku succeeded General Nozu Michitsura commander of the IJA Fifth Division of the IJA First Army. Later, he successively held posts as commander of the Imperial Guards and Governor-general for the defense of Tokyo. He was elevated to the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system in 1895, and was promoted to army general in 1903.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Oku went to the front as commanding general of the IJA 2nd Army and was noted for his role in the Battle of Nanshan, Battle of Shaho, Battle of Mukden, and other campaigns.

Oku was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (1st class) in 1906, and elevated from baron to &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) in 1907. In 1911, he received the largely honorary rank of Field Marshal.

Oku refused to attend strategy and staff meetings, and thereby gained a reputation for being both a &quot;lone wolf&quot; and also a brilliant tactician capable of independent action. However, Oku&#x27;s reluctance to attend the staff meetings was due to his partial deafness, and inability to comprehend and contribute to the discussions.

===Post-war life===
Oku had absolutely no interest in politics, and lived in virtual seclusion after the war. When he died of an Intracranial hemorrhage in 1930, many people were astonished, thinking that he had died years previously.

<text>Arthur Melvin &quot;Art&quot; Okun (November 28, 1928 – March 23, 1980) was an American economist. 

Okun is known in particular for Okun&#x27;s law, an observed relationship that states that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, a country&#x27;s GDP will be roughly an additional 2.5% lower than its potential GDP. He is also known as the creator of the misery index and the analogy of the deadweight loss of taxation with a leaky bucket. 

== Biography ==
Okun graduated from Columbia College in 1949 with the Albert Asher Green Memorial Prize for the highest GPA. He went on to obtain a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia in 1956 before teaching at Yale University.

He served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers between 1968 and 1969. Afterwards, he became a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1968 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

He died on March 23, 1980, of a heart attack.

<text>Richard Meltzer (born May 10, 1945) is an American rock critic, performer, writer and songwriter. He is considered by some rock historians to be the first to write real analysis of rock and roll and is credited with inventing &quot;rock criticism&quot;.

==Biography==
Meltzer claims that as a young man he was influenced by the pop artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg and by the artists Paul Cézanne and Marcel Duchamp. Meltzer&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Aesthetics of Rock&quot;, evolved out of his undergraduate studies in philosophy at Stony Brook University and graduate studies at Yale University. One of his actions involved sending a tape recorder to class with his comments for the day on tape. Fellow student Sandy Pearlman was responsible for pushing the button. Meltzer also dabbled in art, including &quot;detourned&quot; comic books in the style of the situationists, which had various objects added to the pages.

Meltzer, along with Pearlman and several other students, earned money on the side as booking agents for the big musical acts that came to Stony Brook in the 1960s. Following that, the two started writing lyrics and arranging gigs for a musical group they were promoting, Soft White Underbelly, later renamed Blue Öyster Cult (BÖC). Meltzer wrote the lyrics for many of the band&#x27;s songs, including the hit &quot;Burnin&#x27; for You&quot;.

BÖC guitarist and keyboardist Allen Lanier is often credited with coming up with the umlaut over the O, but Meltzer claims to have suggested it to producer and manager Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: &quot;I said, &#x27;How about an umlaut over the O?&#x27; Metal had a Wagnerian aspect anyway.&quot;

Meltzer started his career in 1967 writing for Paul Williams&#x27;s &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; magazine. That year, he also taught a class in aesthetics at the Maryland Institute College of Art. He went on to write for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Creem&quot;.

During the punk rock era, he formed a band called VOM (short for &quot;vomit&quot;) and released a four-song, 7-inch EP that included &quot;Electrocute Your Cock&quot;. Meltzer also produced a movie, directed by Richard Casey, who later directed several Blue Öyster Cult videos. Clips were filmed in Casey&#x27;s apartment; in Malibu, California; at the Pike in Long Beach; and at a beach-side sewage treatment plant in El Segundo, with future Mau Maus guitarist Mike R. Livingston pantomiming rhythm guitar along with Gregg Turner and (known at that time as Kevin Saunders), who were then organizing the Angry Samoans with Mike Saunders, the drummer for VOM. The film for &quot;Electrocute Your Cock&quot; shows Meltzer in the shower, clad in a T-shirt reading&quot;Halifax, NS&quot;, with jumper cables attached to his crotch and sparks hand-drawn onto the film cels simulating electrocution. Also included was a beach-side clip for &quot;Punkmobile.&quot; The videos are included in the Angry Samoans&#x27; 1995 VHS compilation, &quot;True Documentary&quot;.

In the 1980s, Meltzer dabbled in architectural criticism, writing a series of articles for the &quot;L.A. Reader&quot; alternative weekly on the ugliest buildings in Los Angeles; these pieces were later published as a book. He moved to Portland, Oregon in the 1990s, but continued contributing to the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;. He was also a regular columnist for &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot;, and by 2004 he was a contributor to a new weekly, &quot;Los Angeles CityBeat&quot;.

In 2002 he released the CD &quot;Tropic of Nipples&quot; along with Smegma, VOM, Antler and Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices.

He has also performed and recorded over the past decade with the improvisational music group Smegma.

In 2012, Meltzer contributed spoken-word parts to &quot;Spielgusher&quot;, a musical collaboration with bassist Mike Watt, drummer Yuko Araki and guitarist Hirotaka Shimizu. Meltzer and Watt had originally hoped to collaborate during Watt&#x27;s time in The Minutemen, but it was not completed before the death of Minutemen guitarist D. Boon.

<text>George Andrew Olah (born Oláh András György; May 22, 1927 – March 8, 2017) was a Hungarian-American chemist. His research involved the generation and reactivity of carbocations via superacids. For this research, Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994 &quot;for his contribution to carbocation chemistry.&quot; He was also awarded the Priestley Medal, the highest honor granted by the American Chemical Society and F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society in 1996. 

After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he emigrated to the United Kingdom, which he left for Canada in 1964, finally resettling in the United States in 1965. According to György Marx, he was one of The Martians.

==Early life and education==
Olah was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May 22, 1927, into a Jewish couple, Magda (Krasznai) and Gyula Oláh, a lawyer. After the high school of Budapesti Piarist Gimnazium, he studied under organic chemist Géza Zemplén at the Technical University of Budapest, now the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where he earned M.S. and Ph.D degrees in chemical engineering. From 1949 through 1954, he taught at the school as a professor of organic chemistry. In the subsequent two years, from 1954 to 1956, he worked at the research institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, where he was associate scientific director and head of the department of organic chemistry.

==Career and research==
As a result of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he and his family moved briefly to England and then to Canada, where he joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. Olah&#x27;s pioneering work on carbocations started during his eight years with Dow. In 1965, he returned to academia at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, chairing the department of chemistry from 1965 to 1969, and from 1967 through 1977 he was the C. F. Maybery Distinguished Professor of Research in Chemistry. In 1971, Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then moved to the University of Southern California in 1977.

At USC, Olah was a distinguished professor and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. Starting in 1980, he served as the Distinguished Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Professor
of Chemistry and later became a distinguished professor in USC&#x27;s school of engineering. In 1994, Olah was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his contribution to carbocation chemistry&quot;. In particular, Olah&#x27;s search for stable nonclassical carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane stabilized by superacids, like FSO3H-SbF5 (&quot;Magic Acid&quot;).

Because these cations were able to be stabilized, scientists could now use infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study them in greater depth, as well as use them as catalysts in organic synthesis reactions.

Olah, with Canadian chemist Saul Winstein, was also involved in a career-long battle with Herbert C. Brown of Purdue over the existence of so-called &quot;nonclassical&quot; carbocations – such as the norbornyl cation, which can be depicted as cationic character delocalized over several bonds. Olah&#x27;s studies of the cation with NMR spectroscopy provided more evidence suggesting that Winstein&#x27;s model of the non-classical cation, &quot;featuring a pair of [delocalized] electrons smeared between three carbon atoms,&quot; was correct.

In 1997, the Olah family formed an endowment fund (the George A. Olah Endowment) which grants annual awards to outstanding chemists, including the George A. Olah Award in Hydrocarbon or Petroleum Chemistry, formerly known as the ACS Award in Petroleum Chemistry. The awards are selected and administered by the American Chemical Society.

Later in his career, his research shifted from hydrocarbons and their transformation into fuel to the methanol economy, namely generating methanol from methane. He joined with Robert Zubrin, Anne Korin, and James Woolsey in promoting a flexible-fuel mandate initiative. In 2005, Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy in which he suggested that methanol could be produced from hydrogen gas (H2) and industrially derived or atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using energy from renewable and nuclear sources to power the production process.

==Personal life==
He married Judit Ágnes Lengyel (&quot;Judith Agnes Lengyel&quot;) in 1949, and they had two children, György (&quot;George&quot;), born in Hungary in 1954, and Ronald, born in the U.S. in 1959. Olah died on March 8, 2017, at his home in Beverly Hills, California. After his death, the Hungarian government said that the &quot;country has lost a great patriot and one of the most outstanding figures of Hungarian scientific life.&quot;

<text>The PowerBook G3 is a series of laptop Macintosh personal computers that was designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1997 to 2001. It was the first laptop to use the PowerPC G3 (PPC740/750) series of microprocessors, and was marketed as the fastest laptop in the world for its entire production run. The PowerBook G3 was succeeded by the PowerBook G4.

The G3 was the first black Apple laptop, and was succeeded in this by the black MacBook in 2006. Previous PowerBooks were dark gray.

The Wallstreet, Lombard, and Pismo models were praised for their straightforward upgrade options, not only for accessible drives and memory but also for their CPU daughtercards that could be detached from the logic boards. This encouraged the aftermarket, including Sonnet, Powerlogix, Wegener Media, and others, to offer G3 CPU upgrades across various series. In some instances, they even provided G4 upgrades, allowing these machines to rival or exceed the performance of Apple&#x27;s contemporary &#x27;G4 Titanium&#x27; PowerBooks of that era.

==Macintosh PowerBook G3 (Kanga)==
The first Macintosh PowerBook G3, code-named &quot;Kanga&quot;, was introduced in November 1997. At the time of its introduction, the PowerBook G3 was advertised as the fastest notebook computer available (a title formerly held by its predecessor, the 240 MHz PPC-603ev-based PowerBook 3400c). This model was based on the PowerBook 3400c, and was unofficially known as the PowerBook 3500. It used the same case as the 3400c, and a very similar motherboard. The motherboard was upclocked from 40 MHz to 50 MHz, resulting in some incompatibility with older 3400 RAM modules. Other changes to the motherboard included doubling the onboard RAM from 16 MB to 32 MB, and a faster version of the on-board Chips and Technologies graphics controller. The G3 made the Kanga more than twice as fast as a 3400c, and the improved graphics controller allowed it to refresh the screen 74 percent faster.

This first PowerBook G3 shipped with a 250 MHz G3 processor and a 12.1-inch TFT SVGA LCD. It is the only G3 system that is not officially compatible with Mac OS X (though various methods not sanctioned by Apple can be used to install OS X). The Kanga was on the market for less than 5 months, and is largely regarded as a stopgap system that allowed Apple to ship G3 PowerBooks sooner, while Apple prepared its more revolutionary PowerBook G3 Series. As a result, the Kanga has the dubious distinction of being Apple&#x27;s most quickly deprecated PowerBook. Nevertheless, many people chose to purchase a Kanga to continue using their interchangeable expansion bay modules, batteries, and other peripherals from the Powerbook 190, 5300 and 3400 models. The Kanga was also notably smaller in depth and width than the subsequent Wallstreet Powerbooks, and the Kanga remained the smallest-when-open G3 laptop until the debut of the Apple iBook some years later.

==PowerBook G3 Series (Wallstreet I)==

The second generation of PowerBook G3s, now called the PowerBook G3 Series, was introduced in May 1998. The machine was completely redesigned with a new case that was lighter and more rounded than the previous PowerBook G3; however, it was still an Old World ROM Macintosh. The new PowerBooks, code-named Wallstreet, came in three screen sizes: a 12&quot; passive matrix LCD, a 13.3-inch TFT LCD, and a 14.1-inch TFT LCD. The 12.1&quot; models had 2 MB VRAM onboard, while the 13.3&quot; and 14.1&quot; models were equipped with 4 MB VRAM allowing for &#x27;millions of colors&#x27; at maximum resolution (1024×768 for both; the 13.3&quot; having a higher pixel density). The 13.3&quot; display came with a quick-to-fail ribbon cable that was produced too short, leading to a swath of warranty repairs that led Apple to remove the 13.3&quot; model from the lineup after the initial production run. The Wallstreet was the first PowerBook to use industry-standard ATA optical drives. This change meant that CD and DVD recorders designed for Wintel machines could more easily be used in this computer, often at a price far less than those manufactured by Apple. It also came in three CPU speeds: 233 MHz, 250 MHz, and 292 MHz. The 233 MHz model was sometimes nicknamed Mainstreet, as it lacked L2 cache, making it far slower than the other two in the lineup. The 250 MHz and 292 MHz models shipped with 1 MB of cache. Because of this large cache, as well as the swifter system bus, the Wallstreets were known to suffer from some heat issues. Many of the problems of the Wallstreet PowerBook G3s were fixed in the next revision, the Wallstreet II. The WallStreet I was the last PowerBook assembled by Apple in Cork, Ireland.

==PowerBook G3 Series (Wallstreet II, PDQ - &quot;Pretty Darn Quick&quot;)==
The Wallstreet design was updated in August 1998 (Wallstreet-II). It featured a 14.1-inch display on 266 MHz and 300 MHz models. The 233 MHz machine was now equipped with a vastly improved TFT panel (compared to the passive matrix of the 12.1&quot; Wallstreet I series), as well as a 512 KB backside cache allowing for far superior performance at the same 233 MHz, though it was equipped with 2 MB onboard VRAM compared to the 4 MB on the faster 14.1&quot; models. The 13.3&quot; display was removed from the line, owing to both the falling production costs of the larger TFT and the near-guaranteed failure of the 13.3&quot; models&#x27; ribbon cable through the hinge; it was produced slightly too short, and many failed soon after purchase. Processor speeds were bumped on the faster two models, resulting in 233 MHz, 266 MHz, and 300 MHz models.

The case has two docking bays, one on each side. The left-hand bay can accommodate a battery, a 3.5&quot; floppy disk, a third-party Iomega Zip drive, or a third-party add-on hard drive. The right-hand bay is larger and can accommodate any of the above plus a 5.25&quot; optical drive (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM). A small internal nickel–cadmium battery allowed swapping of the main batteries while the computer &quot;slept&quot;. With a battery in each bay, battery life was doubled. DVDs can be displayed with the use of a hardware decoder built into a CardBus (PCMCIA) card.

The PowerBook G3 Series was Apple&#x27;s first notebook offering that matched the build-to-order customization of the Power Mac G3 desktop line. It was discontinued in May 1999. It is the last Apple computer ever to bear the rainbow-colored Apple logo, and the last Mac to support Apple&#x27;s SuperDrive. It was also the last Old World ROM model in the PowerBook series. The PDQ series was entirely produced in Taiwan, and the machine&#x27;s manufacture labels (showing production in Ireland or Taiwan) on the underside of the machines can be used to identify between otherwise nearly identical Wallstreet and PDQ series for collectors and enthusiasts.

The 12.1&quot; and 13.3&quot; Wallstreet I and PDQ series shared a more curved top case at all corners; the lid and its corners were flattened and squared off for the larger LCD of the 14.1&quot; model resulting in a bulkier appearance. Many press releases and visual media at the time relied on the more &#x27;attractive&#x27; curvature of the case on those smaller-display models, regardless of the 14.1&quot; model&#x27;s superior and more upmarket display.

==PowerBook G3 Bronze Keyboard (Lombard) ==
The third generation of PowerBook G3 (Lombard) was introduced in May 1999. It was much slimmer and lighter than its predecessor and was the first New World ROM PowerBook. It had longer battery life, and as with the Wallstreet II the user could double the duration to 10 hours by substituting a second battery for the optical drive in the expansion bay. The keyboard was also improved and now featured translucent bronze-tinted plastics, which is the origin of the &quot;bronze keyboard&quot; nickname. It was also the first Apple laptop to have a glowing Apple logo on the back.

Internal hard drives for the Pismo, Lombard, and Wallstreet II can be used interchangeably. The expansion bay drives (DVD, CD, floppy, battery) are interchangeable on the Pismo and Lombard, but not on the Wallstreet. A DVD drive was optional on the 333 MHz model and standard on the 400 MHz version. The 400 MHz model included a hardware MPEG-2 decoder for DVD playback, while the 333 MHz model was left without (except for the PC card one used by Wallstreet). Further DVD playback optimizations enabled both models to play back DVDs without use of hardware assistance. This model introduced USB ports to the PowerBook line while retaining SCSI support and eliminating ADB entirely (although the keyboard and touchpad still used an ADB interface internally). Graphics were provided by an ATi Rage LT Pro chipset on the PCI bus, to drive its 14.1-inch LCD at a maximum resolution of 1024×768.

Mac OS 8.6–10.3.9 are supported by Apple, but 10.4 is not, although OS X will not install (except for 10.0) if both RAM slots are not occupied with identical size RAM. The use of XPostFacto 4 enables users to upgrade to Tiger, and it runs quite well for an unsupported machine. More RAM (up to 512 MB), a greater hard drive (up to 128 GB), and CPU upgrades (up to a 433 MHz G4) are available for these PowerBooks.

==PowerBook G3 FireWire (Pismo)==
The fourth generation of PowerBook G3 (Pismo), was introduced in February 2000. It was code named &quot;Pismo&quot; after the City of Pismo Beach, California. For this generation Apple dropped &quot;G3&quot; from the name.

The original Pismo was rumored to be a latchless design, akin to the iBook, which is similar in specification. Apple settled on fitting the Pismo board into the form factor of the previous Lombard G3 PowerBook, but with many improvements. The Pismo was available at CPU speeds of 400 MHz or 500 MHz, with a front side bus speed of 100 MHz (one-third swifter than the Lombard&#x27;s front side bus); it also implemented a unified motherboard architecture, and replaced SCSI with the newer FireWire interface (IEEE-1394). The PCI graphics used on the Lombard were updated to an AGP-connected ATi Rage Mobility 128, though the video memory was kept at 8 MB, and could not be upgraded, and the screen&#x27;s resolution was the same as well. A 6× DVD-ROM drive became standard. It was also the first PowerBook with AirPort networking as an official option (although it could be added to the earlier models via various third-party CardBus cards). The Pismo can be upgraded with additional RAM (officially 512 MB with then-available RAM, but it accepts 1 gigabyte) and a larger hard drive (up to 128 GB). Brighter screens and replacement batteries were also available.

The left expansion bay, like the Lombard, could take only a battery, but the right bay was able to accommodate a tray-loading or slot-loading Combo Drive or SuperDrive, a Zip 100 drive, a Zip 250 drive, an LS-120 SuperDisk drive, a VST floppy disk drive, a second hard drive (with adapter, which was tough to find), or a second battery. Lombard and Pismo accept the same expansion bay devices.

Versions of Mac OS from 9.0.2 through 10.4.11 are officially supported. For some time, G3 (750FX) CPU upgrades at speeds of up to 900 MHz and G4 (7410LE) upgrades up to 550 MHz were available. These upgrades are now out of production and must be purchased secondhand.

The Pismo PowerBook was the last of the G3 line. It was succeeded by the PowerBook G4 Titanium models.

==In popular culture==
The PowerBook G3 was featured in many facets of popular culture from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, including &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Kid&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;What Women Want&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, &quot;The Core&quot;, &quot;Duplex&quot;, &quot;Saw&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.

<doc id="758762" wikidata="Q1364589" url="?curid=758762" title="China (Vangelis album)">
<text>China is a studio album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in April 1979. Although he had never been to China, he employed Chinese instruments and compositional styles on this concept album. The album received some critical praise. It was certified silver (1985) for sales of over 60,000 copies by BPI.

==Overview==
At the end of 1978, Vangelis was without a record label contract (the previous official &quot;Beaubourg&quot; was his final with RCA Records), and the next company which supported his recordings was Polydor Records (which already held the rights to the &quot;Sauvage&quot; series of albums).

It is a loose concept album, inspired by the culture, history, and music of China. Vangelis in a 1979 interview said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been there, I had the idea long before the events that placed China at the forefront of the news. For years I have been passionate about the Chinese. I am not talking about politics, I am talking about the old China, the new China as well, about this enormous nation and the people who live there. What is happening there is miraculous, it touches me&quot;.

He &quot;tried to capture in this record China as I feel it, with its peculiar character, its perfume. I find certain resemblances between the music of China and the music of Greece. Of course, I find a lot of musical similarities all around the world&quot;, but &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to do Chinese folk music. I&#x27;m not Chinese, but I did something that I felt had this characteristic colour of Chinese music&quot;.

The thematic concepts noted in the sleeve range from; &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; (Wade-Giles romanization of &quot;Zhongguo&quot;) means &quot;China&quot; (or literally &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;); &quot;The Long March&quot; is inspired by the Long March (1934–1935) with long citation from &quot;Red China Today&quot; by Edgar Snow; &quot;The Dragon&quot; (Lung) is inspired by the Chinese dragon symbolism, &quot;the spirit of change and the creative force of life. In an endless transformation he unfolds from the deepest caves to rise in the clouds&quot;; &quot;The Plum Blossom&quot; is inspired by the Chinese symbolism of Prunus mume, &quot;sexual vitality&quot;; &quot;The Tao Of Love&quot; is inspired by Zhuang Zhou quote &quot;That which is one is one That which is not one is also one&quot;; &quot;The Little Fete&quot; is inspired by the homonymous poem by the 8th century Li Bai, quoted translation from &quot;Taoism&quot; by Jean Campbell Cooper; &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot; is inspired by the homonymous symbolic duality; &quot;Himalaya&quot; is inspired by the 52nd hexagram 艮 (&quot;Gèn&quot; or &quot;Ken&quot;) from I Ching meaning &quot;mountain, to ascend, the solitude, the immovable&quot;; while &quot;Summit&quot; probably by the homonymous summit of symbolic mountain.

The album was promoted with three concerts in Spring of 1979; London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre in April, Brussels Cirque Royal in May, accompanied by the BRIT Symphony Orchestra and Choir, and Paris in June. The cover and back of the album are &quot;melted&quot; images of Vangelis swimming and were taken in the pool of the Hilton Hotel in Athens.

==Release==
Although Polydor issued this album as POLD-5018, and re-issue as SPELP-19 the track timings of either were never accurate, and confusion exists as to the actual lengths of &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; and &quot;The Long March&quot;. Other country releases of &quot;China&quot; have different track lengths and are probably the more accurate releases of &quot;China&quot; with the proper track timings: the white noise and effects intro is actually &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; and the long melodic synthesizer track and piano ending is &quot;The Long March&quot;. The track listing on the article is from 1983 Polydor edition.

&quot;The Long March&quot; was released as a single, with B-side vocalisation track &quot;The Long March Part 2&quot; performed by Vangelis and children of Orleans Infants School Twickenham, with proceeds being donated to UNICEF.

The album reached #31 on the Dutch album charts in 1979.

==Instrumentation==
The album was conceived during a very active period in Vangelis&#x27; recording career, during which he explored the possibilities of electro-acoustic composing. In 1978 Vangelis had a new mixing desk, 24-track recording equipment - the API-mixer and Scully 16-track from &quot;Beaubourg&quot; were replaced by Lyrec 24-track and Quad Eight Pacifica mixer, producing much cleaner sound.

Vangelis employs his synthesizer arsenal to the fullest, generating sound effects (steam locomotive on &quot;Chung Kuo&quot;) and various Chinese-sounding patches on all tracks. Vangelis plays synthesizers, drum machines, electric piano (&quot;The Tao of Love&quot;), piano (&quot;The Long March&quot;, &quot;The Plum Blossom&quot;, &quot;Himalaya&quot;), various Chinese flutes and plucked string instruments. Featured artists are Michel Ripoche (violin on &quot;The Plum Blossom&quot;), Yeung Hak-Fun and Koon Fook Man (narrative on &quot;The Little Fete&quot;).

==Composition==
The works do not sound as a world fusion with Chinese music, but more of a superficial influence. &quot;China&quot; is orchestrated set of simple melodies influenced by the sound of Chinese music. &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; begins with clashing percussive noises which change orchestrated melody with sequenced backing. &quot;The Long March&quot; is a piano solo in a neo-classical way. &quot;The Little Fete&quot; sounds like orchestrated chinoiserie. &quot;Himalaya&quot; is long and atmospheric, and uses washes of sound to evoke cold, windswept mountain spaces.

==Reception==
John Bush of Allmusic noted that &quot;few tracks use acoustic piano and other organic instruments, the centerpieces &quot;Chung Kuo,&quot; &quot;The Dragon&quot; and &quot;Himalaya&quot; use bracing percussion and synthesizer effects to emphasize the subjects&quot;, and that Vangelis with the &quot;ringing synthesizer textures and stately rhythms&quot; successfully evoked &quot;the majesty of China&quot;.

Scott subsequently employed Vangelis to score his 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.
*&quot;Himalaya&quot; and &quot;The Little Fete&quot; appeared (along with much of Vangelis&#x27;s other work) in Carl Sagan&#x27;s 1980 documentary miniseries &quot;&quot; (for instance, &quot;Himalaya&quot; appears in the second episode &quot;One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue&quot;, when Sagan tours the interior of a cell and features DNA replication).

<doc id="758763" wikidata="Q284967" url="?curid=758763" title="Cold-stimulus headache">
<text>A cold-stimulus headache, colloquially known as an ice-cream headache or brain freeze, is a form of brief pain or headache commonly associated with consumption (particularly quick consumption) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream, popsicles, and snow cones. It is caused by a cold substance touching the roof of the mouth, and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels, &quot;referring&quot; pain from the roof of the mouth to the head. The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor. It can also occur during a sudden exposure of the unprotected head to cold temperatures, such as by diving into cold water. A cold-stimulus headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity, a type of dental pain that can occur under similar circumstances.

Cats and other animals have been observed exhibiting a similar reaction when presented with a similar stimulus.

==History==
According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the first written account of a cold-stimulus headache comes from Patrick Brydone in the 1770s. Brydone described a British naval officer in Sicily who consumed a large bite of ice cream and spat it out &quot;with a horrid oath&quot;.

The term &quot;ice-cream headache&quot; has been in use since at least January 31, 1937, contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Ask Utopia: A Quaker Family in Soviet Russia&quot;. The first published use of the term &quot;brain freeze&quot;, in the sense of a cold-stimulus headache, was in 1991. 7-Eleven has trademarked the term.

==Cause and frequency==
A cold-stimulus headache is thought to be the direct result of the rapid cooling and rewarming of the capillaries in the sinuses leading to periods of vasoconstriction and vasodilation. A similar, but painless, blood vessel response causes the face to appear &quot;flushed&quot; after being outside on a cold day. In both instances, the low temperature causes the capillaries in the sinuses to constrict and then experience extreme rebound dilation as they warm up again.

In the palate, this dilation is sensed by nearby pain receptors, which then send signals back to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, one of the major nerves of the facial area. This nerve also senses facial pain, so as the neural signals are conducted the brain interprets the pain as coming from the forehead—the same &quot;referred pain&quot; phenomenon seen in heart attacks. Brain-freeze pain may last from a few seconds to a few minutes. Research suggests that the same vascular mechanism and nerve implicated in &quot;brain freeze&quot; cause the aura (sensory disturbance) and pulsatile (throbbing pain) phases of migraines.

It is possible to have a cold-stimulus headache in both hot and cold weather, contrary to popular belief, because the effect relies upon the temperature of the food being consumed rather than that of the environment. Other causes that may mimic the sensation of cold-stimulus headache include that produced when high speed drilling is performed through the inner table of the skull in people undergoing such a procedure in an awake or sedated state.
===Anterior cerebral artery theory===
Another theory into the cause of cold-stimulus headaches is explained by increased blood flow to the brain through the anterior cerebral artery, which supplies oxygenated blood to most medial portions of the frontal lobes and superior medial parietal lobes. This increase in blood volume and resulting increase in size in this artery is thought to bring on the pain associated with a cold-stimulus headache.

When the anterior cerebral artery constricts, reining in the response to this increased blood volume, the pain disappears. The dilation, then quick constriction, of this blood vessel may be a type of self-defense for the brain.

This inflow of blood cannot be cleared as quickly as it is coming in during the cold-stimulus headache, so the blood flow could raise the pressure inside the skull and induce pain that way. As the intracranial pressure and temperature in the brain rise the blood vessel contracts, and the pressure in the brain is reduced before reaching dangerous levels.

==Research==
Due to how shortlived the headache is, researchers like Amokrane Chebini and Esma Dilli have voiced how difficult it is to study the phenomenon. Thus, there is not much research that has been conducted on the topic.

The phenomenon is common enough to have been the subject of research published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and &quot;Scientific American&quot;. A study conducted by Maya Kaczorowski demonstrated a higher incidence of headache in subjects consuming an ice cream sample quickly, in less than five seconds, vs. those who consumed slowly, taking longer than thirty seconds (27% and 12%, respectively).

According to research conducted by Nigel Bird, Anne MacGregor, and Marcia I. Wilkinson published in the journal &quot;Headache&quot;, &quot;17% of the migraine patients and 46% of the students developed headache following palatal application or a swallow of ice cream.&quot;

According to research conducted by Ilaria Bonemazzi and several other colleagues found that the children participants in their study were more likely to develop cold-stimulus headaches compared to their adult counterparts. This may suggest that children are more sensitive to cold-stimulus headaches, and that children grow a resistance to these headaches as they grow into adults.

Cold-stimulus headaches are not always caused by consuming ice cream and other cold foods similar to it; it has been found that simply being in a colder environment may trigger the same symptoms associated with a cold-stimulus headache. In a letter written by SK Jankelowitz and AS Zagami, the authors describe a patient who experienced cold-stimulus headache symptoms while she was ice skating. 

In research conducted by Anthony Khoo, Michelle Kiley, and Peter J Goadsby, it was found that naproxen was seen to prevent the symptoms of a cold-stimulus headache when it was taken thirty minutes before the exposure and ingestion of a cold substance. This study opens the door to a world of methods to ensure the prevention of cold-stimulus headaches.

<text>Martin Edward Corry MBE (born 12 October 1973) is a retired English rugby union player who represented and captained and Leicester Tigers in a career spanning 14 seasons. Corry played 64 times for between 1997 and 2007, played 7 tests for the British &amp; Irish Lions on tours in 2001 &amp; 2005, and played 290 times for Leicester between 1997 and 2009. Earlier in his career he played top division rugby for Newcastle Gosforth and Bristol. A versatile player his principal positions were number eight and blindside flanker, he also played lock more as his career progressed.

Corry started the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final, and was an unused substitute as England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final. He was a Premiership Rugby champion six times (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007 &amp; 2009) and European Champion twice in 2001 and 2002.

==Early life==
Born in Birmingham, Corry was educated at Tunbridge Wells Grammar School, and first played rugby union for Tunbridge Wells minis.

==Career==
===University, Newcastle and England under 21s===
Corry attended the University of Northumbria, impressing for their rugby team, before being named as a reserve for a Courage League game for Newcastle Gosforth against Bath. By April 1994 Corry had been called up for England under 21s and was described in the press as a &quot;flanker of rare talent&quot;, in October 1994 Corry was named as England under 21&#x27;s captain. Corry captained the under 21s to a victory over New Zealand Youth, and also captained Northumbria University to a British Universities championship. Following Newcastle&#x27;s failure to gain promotion in the 1994–95 Courage League National Division Two season Corry was one of a number of leading players who moved on, in his case joining Bristol.

===England debut, Leicester title win and 1999 Rugby World Cup===
In 1995 Corry joined Bristol. In February 1997 he was named as part of a 62 man long-list for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa, one of three uncapped players at that stage, but was not in the final squad, instead he made his England debut in May 1997 against Argentina.

Corry moved to Leicester Tigers in the summer of 1997, despite having one year remaining on his Bristol contract, which prompted legal threats from Bristol.

Corry made his Leicester debut on 30 August 1997 against Gloucester at Welford Road, and despite being sent off in a 15 all draw against Northampton Saints played 27 times across number 8, flanker and lock in his first season. The following season saw Corry establish himself as Tigers first choice number 8, starting 29 times in the season; Corry made amends for his red card the previous season as he scored a crucial try in a 1st v 2nd match against Northampton, the 22–15 win effectively sealed the first of Leicester&#x27;s four successive Premiership Rugby titles.

After selection for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Corry returned to Leicester on 30 October 1999 scoring a try against Bedford Blues in a 61–12 win. Corry was then an ever present as Tigers lost only 1 game in 16 to retain the Premiership Rugby title, he also captained the side for the first time in a European game against Leinster.

===European titles and first Lions tour===
2000–01 season saw Corry again be a regular member of Leicester pack, switching between flanker and number 8 with Will Johnson, he played 30 times as Tigers retained the Premiership Rugby title for a third straight year. This season Tigers also progressed in Europe; Corry started as Leicester beat Swansea in the quarter-finals and Gloucester in semis, Corry started the 2001 Heineken Cup Final at blindside flanker as Leicester beat Stade Français 34–30.

In 2001 Corry was called up to the British and Irish Lions side after the tour had started, due to injuries within the squad, and immediately impressed Graham Henry, the Lions coach. He started the first test in the absence of the injured Neil Back, and replaced the injured Richard Hill in the second before starting the third test in the absence of Hill. He played in the delayed Six Nations decider in Dublin in October 2001 for England.

Corry missed much of the first half of the 2001–02 season with injury and international call ups but returned in December to be an ever-present until Leicester secured their fourth straight Premiership Rugby title on 13 April 2002 against Newcastle Falcons at Welford Road. Corry started the 2002 Heineken Cup Final where Leicester beat Munster, they were the first side to retain the European trophy.

===2003 Rugby World Cup, England captaincy and second Lions tour===
Corry confirmed his selection for Clive Woodward&#x27;s Rugby World Cup squad in a highly competitive back row area with a strong late run in England&#x27;s warm-up matches: he performed well in the 43–9 defeat of Wales at the Millennium Stadium in late Summer of 2003 and then again in the September defeat of France at Twickenham. He was part of England&#x27;s 2003 World Cup-winning squad, chosen ahead of teammate Graham Rowntree. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Corry flew home from Australia for the birth of his first child, daughter Eve. He rejoined the squad days later, and played in England&#x27;s victory over Uruguay. He was an unused replacement in the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final.

In 2005, Corry was named as England Captain for the Six Nations match against Italy and Scotland, in the absence of Jason Robinson. Leicester reached the semi-finals of the 2004-05 Heineken Cup, but Corry missed the semi-final defeat by Toulouse due to suspension following a red card against Saracens. However, in May 2005 he was named as both the player of the 2004-05 Premiership Rugby season at the end of year awards, and the players&#x27; player of the season. Despite the individual accolades Leicester were to come up short losing the Premiership final to Wasps.

In the summer Corry was selected for his second Lions tour, this time to New Zealand, and was made vice-captain for the first test. He went on to captain the team from the 2nd minute onwards as Brian O&#x27;Driscoll was injured in a notorious spear tackle incident. However, he was dropped for the final two tests in favour of Ryan Jones.

===Leicester captain===
Corry was named as Leicester&#x27;s new club captain in August 2005, taking over after the retirement of Martin Johnson. Following his selection on the 2005 Lions tour Corry returned ahead of schedule to captain the club in the first match of the season, playing 48 minutes in a 32–0 win over Northampton. He was again selected as England&#x27;s captain for the 2005 autumn internationals and 2006 Six Nations tournament. Corry played 24 times for Leicester that season as they reached a European quarter-final, and an Anglo-Welsh semi-final, before losing to the Sale Sharks in the 2006 Premiership final.

Tigers gained some revenge for that loss in the opening game of the 2006-07 Premiership Rugby season, Corry particularly impressing and scoring in a 35–23 win against Sale. He continued as captain for the 2006 Autumn Internationals, in which England lost to New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa. Following these results, England Head coach Andy Robinson left his post and was replaced by Brian Ashton. In his first squad selection as England coach, Ashton named Corry in the starting line-up for the 2007 Six Nations opener against Scotland, though he was replaced as captain by Phil Vickery. Corry remained in the side as the tournament progressed, but in the final two games of the tournament (against France and Wales) he was moved to lock.

Corry captained Leicester in the 2007 Anglo-Welsh Cup Final, a 41–35 win that ended a 5-year trophy drought for the club. A week later Corry was selected as &quot;Man of the match&quot; when Leicester beat the Scarlets 33–17 in the 2007 Heineken Cup semi-final. Corry won his fifth Premiership medal, starting the final and scoring a try as Leicester defeated Gloucester to secure the domestic double. They could not make it a treble though, losing the 2007 Heineken Cup Final to Wasps, 25–9.

===2007 Rugby World Cup and final seasons===
In 2007, Corry formed part of the Ashton&#x27;s Rugby World Cup squad in which England progressed to the Final in Paris but were ultimately unable to defend their world title, losing to South Africa. The following year, Corry reportedly turned down Ashton&#x27;s offer of a place in the England&#x27;s squad for the opening fixture of their 2008 Six Nations campaign, instead announcing his retirement from international rugby at the age of 34. This move was made in order that he could focus on his remaining club career with Leicester tigers.

Following the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Corry returned to Leicester as captain. His regular position switched to blindside flanker to accommodate Jordan Crane who had come into the side in Corry&#x27;s absence. Corry started the 2008 Anglo-Welsh Cup Final, which ended in defeat to the Ospreys, and the 2008 Premiership final, where Wasps were once again winners in a Twickenham showpiece final. In April 2008, Corry signed a one-year contract extension with Leicester.

Corry&#x27;s final season saw him play mainly at lock, Tom Croft had developed and was now first choice blindside flanker. His final game for Leicester was on 24 January 2009, in a European Cup match against the Ospreys. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2008–2009 season. Following Leicester&#x27;s victory in the 2009 Premiership Rugby Final Corry was on hand to lift the trophy, despite not playing, and the following week he captained the Barbarians against England at Twickenham, to a 33–26 victory in his final match of his professional career. 

==Personal life==
Corry flew back from Australia during the 2003 World Cup for the birth of his first child. He re-joined the squad just a few days later. His son Edward was born soon after the end of the 2006 Six Nations Championship and a daughter was born in 2009. Corry returned to Tunbridge Wells to play a charity match, aged 50, with his son in 2023.

<doc id="758766" wikidata="Q1279966" url="?curid=758766" title="Popular Unity (Chile)">
<text>Popular Unity (, UP) was a left-wing political alliance in Chile that stood behind the successful candidacy of Salvador Allende for the 1970 Chilean presidential election.

==History==
Successor to the FRAP coalition, Popular Unity originally comprised most of the Chilean Left: the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Party, the Social Democrat Party, the Independent Popular Action and MAPU (&quot;Movimiento de Acción Popular Unitario&quot;). They were later joined in 1971 by the Christian Left and in 1972 by the MAPU Obrero Campesino (a splinter group). UP also initially included the moderate Party of the Radical Left, but in 1972 it joined the opposition (inside the Confederation of Democracy).

UP&#x27;s leader, Salvador Allende, was a Marxist who co-founded Chile&#x27;s Socialist Party. His slight plurality in the election resulted in his confirmation as president by the National Congress of Chile. The loose and conditional support from the Christian Democratic Party that made this confirmation possible soon disintegrated, as did centrism of any viable kind in an atmosphere of increasing political polarization. The Revolutionary Left Movement clashed with the conservative and establishment forces, while armed right-wing elements plotted to destabilize the government with support from the Nixon administration. The Unidad Popular coalition itself experienced political conflicts. Generally, the Communist Party, the Radical Party and later MAPU/OC advocated more cautious policies, whereas a part of the Socialist Party supported more radical changes and was often supported by MAPU and Christian Left.

The Pact of Popular Unity (Pacto de la Unidad Popular) was signed on 26 December 1969 in Santiago by following representatives of political parties:

* Luis Corvalán, General Secretary of the Communist Party
* Aniceto Rodríguez, General Secretary of the Socialist Party
* Carlos Morales, President of the Radical Party
* Esteban Leyton, General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party
* Jaime Gazmuri, General Secretary of the Popular Unitary Action Movement
* Alfonso David Lebón, President of the Independent Popular Action

In August 1973 the Christian Democrats cooperated with the right-wing National Party in the congressional protest that set the stage for the Chilean coup of 1973, the effective end of the UP government and —for 17 years— of democracy in Chile.

== Allende&#x27;s administration ==

Salvador Allende&#x27;s election in 1970 represented several important developments internationally and domestically. He was the first democratically elected socialist leader in Latin America. In contrast with Fidel Castro&#x27;s armed people&#x27;s revolution, Allende proposed a peaceful and legal transition to socialism respecting the constitutional order. Popular Unity had the support of the plurality of Chileans, and initially this support continued to grow. Allende was elected with 36% of the popular vote in 1970. Five months into his presidency, his approval rating had grown to 49%. This was where his support peaked. Following severe inflation and food shortages Allende&#x27;s popularity started to dip. With 44%., the Popular Unity progressed in the 1973 legislative election but did not win the majority. The right did not have enough congressmen to destitute Allende, the country was plunged into a political crisis on top of the economic crisis. The left-wing government and the right-wing opposition in Congress were unable to reach a compromise on economic policy. The political violence exploded during 1973 with a first attempted coup d&#x27;Etat on 29 June and the assassination of Arturo Araya Peeters, aide-de-camp of Allende, the 27 July. Finally, anti-socialist elements in the military, with support from US intelligence agencies, orchestrated a successful coup d&#x27;état on 11 September 1973. The leader of the coup, Augusto Pinochet, seized power and assassinated the leaders of the Popular Unity.

The UP&#x27;s early economic success was short lived. Despite winning the presidential election, the legislative and judicial powers were still held by the opposition, making it difficult for the government to legislate. The United States, under the Nixon administration, prevented the renegotiation of national debt and placed an embargo on goods from nationalized companies. In response to these efforts, Allende expanded the money supply, and inflation skyrocketed. Food shortages worsened as the embargo limited imports and hoarding in the black-market limited access to food.

== Platform ==
The UP promoted the peaceful transition to socialism. This primarily involved the nationalizing of certain industries and agrarian reform. The UP intended to nationalize basic sources of wealth held by foreign companies and internal monopolies. This included mining of copper, nitrate, iodine, iron, and coal; the country&#x27;s financial system, especially private banks and insurance companies; foreign trade; production and distribution of electricity; air, rail, and maritime transportation; all petroleum-based goods; iron, steel, cement, and paper. Agrarian reform would include the expropriation of &quot;latifundios&quot;, or large holdings of land. In addition to these policies, the UP promoted improved social security and public health, an improved and expanded housing sector, gender equality, and the extension of the right to organize unions.

== Policies ==
The expropriation of the first company, a textile factory, was announced on December 2, 1970. Others followed over the next several months, and the opposition congress unanimously approved a constitutional reform for the nationalization of copper and other resources, expropriating large foreign companies without compensation. There was considerable redistribution of income and falling unemployment. Only the banks resisted the UP’s attempts to nationalize them.

The main beneficiaries of both Eduardo Frei and Allende Land Reform were the peasants already working the land. The process was similar to that of sharecropping, in which the owners of the land pay people to work the land. The peasants working the land keep a percentage of the profit, the rest goes to the owner. The reform policies rarely addressed the small land holders, turning them against the Allende government. Although the UP did not gain full power of the government with Allende’s election, it did gain the administrative and economic ability to limit the power of business owners through expropriations and strengthen the urban working classes and rural peasantry. One large difference between Christian Democrat and Popular Unity governments was their reactions to &quot;tomas&quot;, or seizures of land by the peasants. Frei’s government would not expropriate any land that had been seized, but Allende accelerated expropriations. This led to a massive movement to seize land. In 1967, there were 9 seizures, but in 1971, there were 1,278. Half of these seizures occurred on farms below the land limit of expropriation. The government established peasant councils that were supposed to represent peasant interests. Their failure in doing this played a large role in Allende’s loss of favor among the peasantry. A series of programs, including pay equality, resulted in diminishing incentives to work, and productivity fell. The agrarian reform under Popular Unity resulted in a significant rise in peasant standard of living, an increase in peasant political awareness and activity, and the expropriation of all latifundios. It also was not as extensive, or as successful, as it was expected to be, and Allende lost their potential support.

<text>Visor om slutet () is an all-acoustic folk metal EP by the Finnish band Finntroll. It was released in 2003 by Spinefarm. It was the first album to feature Tapio Wilska on vocals, and the last to feature Jan &quot;Katla&quot; Jämsen, who was forced into retirement in 2003 due to a tumour developing on his vocal cords.

&quot;Visor om slutet&quot; was released after a number of misfortunes befell several band members, including the death of guitarist Teemu Raimoranta, to whom the album is dedicated. It was recorded in a cabin off in the woods near Helsinki, coined as an &quot;acoustic experiment,&quot; and features the use of traditionally non-metal instruments such as the kazoo. Though quite different in its sound to the folk metal-inspired &quot;Jaktens tid&quot;, the album was a relative success.

<text>Chauncey Olcott, born John Chancellor Olcott and often spelled Chauncey Alcott (July 21, 1858 – March 18, 1932), was an American stage actor, songwriter and singer of Irish descent.

==Biography==
He was born in Buffalo, New York. His mother, Margaret (née Doyle), was a native of Killeagh, County Cork. 
In the early years of his career Olcott sang in minstrel shows, before studying singing in London during the 1880s. Lillian Russell played a major role in helping make him a Broadway star. When the producer Augustus Pitou approached him in 1893 to succeed William J. Scanlan as the leading tenor in sentimental operettas on Irish themes, Olcott accepted and performed pseudo-Irish roles for the remainder of his career.

Olcott combined the roles of tenor, actor, lyricist and composer in many productions. He wrote the complete scores to Irish musicals such as &quot;Sweet Inniscara&quot; (1897), &quot;A Romance of Athlone&quot; (1899), &quot;Garrett O&#x27;Magh&quot; (1901), and &quot;Old Limerick Town&quot; (1902). For other productions he collaborated with Ernest R. Ball and George Graff in works such as &quot;The Irish Artist&quot; (1894), &quot;Barry of Ballymore&quot; (1910), &quot;Macushla&quot; (1912), and &quot;The Isle o&#x27; Dreams&quot; (1913). There are some 20 such works between 1894 and 1920.

He was a good songwriter who captured the mood of his Irish-American audience by combining melodic and rhythmic phrases from traditional Irish music with melancholy sentiment. Some numbers from his musicals became popular, such as &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot; from &quot;A Romance of Athlone&quot;, &quot;Mother Machree&quot; from &quot;Barry of Ballymore&quot;, and &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; from &quot;The Isle o&#x27; Dreams&quot;. Sometimes he used tunes from others, such as that of the title song from &quot;Macushla&quot; from Irish composer Dermot Macmurrough (pseudonym of Harold R. White) or &quot;Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral&quot; by James Royce Shannon for his production &quot;Shameen Dhu&quot; (1914).

In 1925, a serious illness forced him to retire, and he moved to Monte Carlo where he died of pernicious anemia in 1932. His body was brought home and interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==

Olcott&#x27;s life story was told in the 1947 Warner Bros. motion picture &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot; starring Dennis Morgan as Olcott. The film&#x27;s plot was based on the biography by Olcott&#x27;s widow, Rita Olcott, &quot;Song in His Heart&quot; (1939).

In 1970, Olcott was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

<doc id="758777" wikidata="Q1334313" url="?curid=758777" title="Wind Cave National Park">
<text>Wind Cave National Park is a national park of the United States located north of the town of Hot Springs in western South Dakota. Established on January 3, 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, it was the sixth national park in the U.S. and the first cave to be designated a national park anywhere in the world. The cave is notable for its calcite formations known as boxwork, as well as its frostwork. Approximately 95 percent of the world&#x27;s discovered boxwork formations are found in Wind Cave.

Wind Cave is one of the best known examples of a breathing cave. The cave is recognized as the densest cave system in the world, with the greatest passage volume per cubic mile. Wind Cave is the seventh longest cave in the world with of explored cave passageways () and the third longest cave in the United States, though it is only the second longest cave in Custer County, South Dakota behind Jewel Cave. Despite the close proximity, no connection has ever been found between Wind Cave and Jewel Cave and most geologists believe the caves are not connected. Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed grass prairie in the United States, as well as the southern terminus of the South Dakota Centennial Trail.

==Origin of name==
The passages of the cave are said to &quot;breathe&quot; as air continually moves into or out of them, equalizing the atmospheric pressure of the cave and the outside air. When the air pressure is higher outside the cave than inside it, air flows into the cave, raising the cave&#x27;s pressure to match the outside pressure. When the air pressure inside the cave is higher than outside it, air flows out of the cave, lowering the air pressure within the cave. A large cave such as Wind Cave with only a few small openings will &quot;breathe&quot; more obviously than a small cave with many large openings.

Rapid weather changes, accompanied by rapid barometric changes, are a feature of western South Dakota weather. If a fast-moving storm was approaching on the day the Bingham brothers found the cave, the atmospheric pressure would have been dropping fast, causing the cave&#x27;s higher-pressure air to rush out all available openings, creating the wind for which Wind Cave was named.

==History==
The Lakota, Cheyenne, and other Native American tribes who traveled through and made camps around the area were aware of the cave&#x27;s existence, as were early Euro-American settlers, but there has been no recorded evidence discovered that anyone actually entered it.

The Lakota (Sioux), an indigenous people who live in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, spoke of a hole that blew air, a place they consider sacred as the site where they first emerged from the underworld where they had lived before the demiurge creation of the world. Originally called Washun Niya, Wind Cave played an important role in the traditions and culture of the Lakota people. The fables of these people tell the story of Tokahe, the first human to emerge from the cave, symbolizing an emergence from the underworld. His story and presence at Wind Cave is an important part of Lakota history, and heavily influences their origin story.

Wind Cave and other areas throughout the Black Hills were important to the native people in other ways beyond spirituality. Nicknamed, euphemistically, as a &quot;supermarket,&quot; the areas surrounding the cave provided abundant resources for native survival. Often during the winter seasons, such areas served as ideal spots for camps; much of the game they hunted preferred the shelter provided by the cave and made these areas ideal to become Lakota settlements and hunting grounds.

The eventual dispossession of the Lakota people followed the consistent history of dispossession of indigenous peoples across the country. In 1851 a Treaty was formed at Fort Laramie, entering the tribe into a legal relationship with the U.S. government. Another Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 redefined and reduced the borders of Lakota land within the Black Hills. Article two within that treaty allowed for forts to be built within Lakota land and in 1874 General George A. Custer began surveying the land and mistakenly reported a significant presence of gold, despite the geologist on his team of surveyors saying there were no quantities of substance. Miners then began to invade the hills in search of gold, which was against the treaty with the Lakota people, though the government did little to punish such offenses. In 1875 the Lakota title to the land was deemed invalid due to their lack of structural development and supposed &quot;wasting&quot; of the land. When the Dawes Act was passed in 1877, the site was opened to settlers and effectively sealed the dispossession of the Lakota from their ancestral lands.

The first documented discovery of the cave by white Americans was in 1881, when the brothers Tom and Jesse Bingham heard wind rushing out from a by hole in the ground. According to the story, when Tom looked into the hole, the wind exiting the cave blew his hat off of his head.

From 1881 to 1889, few people ventured far into Wind Cave. Then in 1889 the South Dakota Mining Company hired Jesse D. McDonald to oversee their mining claim on the cave site. The South Dakota Mining Company may have hoped to find valuable minerals, or it may have had commercial development of the cave in mind from the start.

No valuable mineral deposits were found, and the McDonald family began developing the cave for tourism. Jesse initially hired his son Alvin (age 16 in 1890) and, beginning in 1891, Alvin&#x27;s brother Elmer, to explore and help develop the cave. Alvin fell in love with the cave and kept a cave diary. Others who worked at Wind Cave and helped explore it between 1890 and 1903 include Katie Stabler, Emma McDonald (Elmer&#x27;s wife), Inez McDonald (Emma and Elmer&#x27;s daughter), and Tommy McDonald (brother of Elmer and Alvin).

By February 1892 the cave was open for visitors; the standard tour fee was apparently $1.00 (equivalent to roughly $30 in 2021). Tourists explored the cave by candlelight on guided tours. These early tours were physically demanding and sometimes involved crawling through narrow passages.

Like the nearby Jewel Cave National Monument, currently the third longest cave in the world, Herb and Jan Conn played an important role in cave exploration during the 1960s.

==Location==
The park is in an unincorporated area of Custer County. The closest municipality is Hot Springs, in Fall River County.

==Flora and fauna==

Wind Cave National Park protects a diverse ecosystem with eastern and western plant and animal species. Wildlife that inhabits this park include raccoons, elk, bison, coyotes, skunks, badgers, ermines, black-footed ferrets, cougars, bobcats, red foxes, minks, whooping crane, pronghorn and prairie dogs. The Wind Cave bison herd is one of only four free-roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd in Utah, and on Elk Island in Alberta, Canada. The Wind Cave bison herd is currently brucellosis-free.

=== Endangered species ===
The black-footed ferret and whooping crane are on the endangered species list. The whooping crane population in Wind Cave National Park is considered a non-self-sustaining wild population.

==Climate==
Throughout the years, the great plains have seen a considerable rise in temperature. Being that Wind Cave is located in the great plains, these temperature rises have already started to affect the park and the area around it. The average temperature rise across the plains has been two degrees Fahrenheit, with some areas seeing increases as high as five degrees Fahrenheit. This trend is projected to cause drought like conditions in the area.

==Infrastructure==
Several roads run through the park and there are of hiking trails on the surface. The park had an estimated 656,397 visitors in 2018. More than 109,000 people toured the cave itself in 2015, the most since 1968 before cave tours were limited to 40 people each.

The Wind Cave visitor center features three exhibit rooms about the geology of the caves and early cave history, the park&#x27;s wildlife and natural history, and the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the park.

Elk Mountain Campground, located in a ponderosa pine forest, is about from the visitor center. The campground has 75 sites for tents and recreational vehicles and is open year-round with campfire programs offered in the summer and limited services available in the winter.

== Geology ==

The three levels making up the Wind Cave system are located in the upper 76 m of the Mississippian Pahasapa Limestone. Deposited in an inland sea, chert, gypsum, and anhydrite lenses within the limestone are evidence of high periods of evaporation. When sea levels dropped at the end of the Mississippian, dissolution of the limestone formed a Kaskaskia paleokarst terrain, complete with solution fissures, sinkholes, and caves. Thus, an unconformity exists between this limestone and the overlying Pennsylvanian Minnelusa Formation. These red sands and clays filled in cavities. Those cavities not filled in were coated in dogtooth spar. Subsequent deposition of the Permian Opeche Shale, Permian Minnekahta Limestone, Triassic Spearfish Formation, and Tertiary White River Group followed. Paleocene and Eocene erosion removed these overlying sediments, in the area of the caves, down to the Minnelusa. Geologic uplift started during the Laramide Orogeny, which lowered the water table, draining the cave system and enlarging it. Today the water level is 150 m below the surface, which amounts to a drop of 0.4 m every 1000 years.

Boxwork was first noted in Wind Cave. These calcite fins were once cracks filling gypsum and anhydrite. Calcite-gypsum pseudomorphs are common. The released sulfuric acid weakened the bedrock, allowing it to weather faster than the calcite. The resultant intersecting fins form open chambers and protrude from the surrounding bedrock by amounts ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 m. Lower levels of the cave have boxworks mixed with frostwork and cave popcorn. Helictite bushes were also first discovered in Wind Cave. Moonmilk is found on many surfaces, while calcite rafts are found in the lower levels of the cave system.

===In popular culture===

During the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary debate on December 19, 2019, candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar referenced the Wind Cave as part of an attack on fellow candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had hosted a campaign fundraiser in a purported wine cave. Klobuchar remarked, &quot;I came here to make a case for progress, and I have never even been to a wine cave. I’ve been to the Wind Cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to.&quot; South Dakota public figures, including the state&#x27;s Representative Dusty Johnson, used it to promote tourism to Wind Cave National Park.

The cave is featured in Dan Jorgensen&#x27;s novel &quot;And the Wind Whispered&quot;.

<text>The Macintosh TV is a personal computer with integrated television capabilities released by Apple Computer in 1993. It was Apple&#x27;s first attempt at computer-television integration. It shares the external appearance of the Macintosh LC 500 series, but in black. The Macintosh TV is essentially a Performa 520 that can switch its built-in 14&quot; Sony Trinitron CRT from being a computer display to a cable-ready television. It is incapable of showing television in a desktop window, although it can capture still frames to PICT files.

It comes with a small credit card-sized remote control that is also compatible with Sony televisions. It was the first Macintosh to be made in black and comes with a matching black keyboard and mouse. Later Apple would issue a custom black Performa 5420 in markets outside the United States with many of the features of the Mac TV. Apple&#x27;s similar TV tuner card was a popular option for later LC, Performa series, and select models of Power Macintosh G3 beige computers.

Only 10,000 were made in the model&#x27;s short time on the market.

==Specifications==
The Macintosh TV is equipped with a 32 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU, a 16 MHz bus, and 5 MB of RAM (which can be expanded to 8 MB). It also comes with a CD-ROM drive, ADB ports for connecting keyboard and mouse, DIN-8 serial ports, and a DB-25 SCSI interface. The performance of the Macintosh TV reaches 7.0 MIPS SIMM, allowing for the use of either a 1 MB or 4 MB SIMM. Additionally, it features an Antenna In (F-type RF Connector), Composite Video-In, Stereo Audio Input (RCA-type), and a 3.6 V lithium PRAM battery, boasting a Gestalt ID of 88 and supporting 32-bit addressing. However, in contrast to most Macintosh models, it does not offer any expansion slots for upgrades.

==Upgrades==
Although there was no official upgrade path provided by Apple, the Macintosh TV chassis is essentially that of the LC 520, and as such supports the same motherboard upgrades. Although the built-in tuner capabilities are lost, installing an LC 575 motherboard is a common method to step up to the significantly faster 68040 processor.

<text>Brasier was a French automobile manufacturer, based in the Paris conurbation, and active between 1905 and 1930. The firm began as Richard-Brasier in 1902, and became known as Chaigneau-Brasier in 1926.

==Origins==

Charles-Henri Brasier worked briefly with Panhard and then for some years with Émile Mors before, at the age of 35, he set himself up as an automobile manufacturer on his own account. He did this in partnership with Georges Richard, the two of them establishing the Richard-Brasier business in 1902.

By 1905, relations had broken down between the partners due to Richard being frequently away from his desk due to his motor racing activities and, it was reported, injuries he sustained as a result. The strained relations prompted Richard to leave the company that year to found Unic. The newly renamed Brasier firm was therefore born into an atmosphere of recrimination and litigation. Nevertheless, Brasier retained the premises originally acquired by the Richard-Brasier company in Ivry, just outside the ring formed by the old city walls (today followed by the &quot;Périphérique&quot; motor-way) on the southern edge of central Paris.

==Early Brasiers==
Before World War I, several twin, four and six-cylinder models were offered. During this period the company was selling around 1,000 cars annually.

==World War I==
Brasier was one of several companies to be contracted to produce the innovative Hispano-Suiza V8 aero engine for use in such scouts as the SPAD S.VII, S.E.5a and Sopwith Dolphin. However, Brasier engines were of such poor quality that the RFC&#x27;s Quartermaster General, Brig.-Gen. Robert Brooke-Popham had to write: &quot;When 1,170 [rpm] SE.5s are allotted, please issue any other 1,170 SE.5 in preference to a Brasier. Brasier engines will only be issued to squadrons when no other 1,170 is available.&quot;

==After WWI==
Following the outbreak of peace, production was resumed in 1919 with a 3404 cc model.

By 1920 Brasier were displaying two models in their high-profile show room, not far from the Place de la Concorde at the prestigious eastern end of the Champs-Élysées The smaller of these was a 4-cylinder 3,392 cc (18 CV/HP) engined car with a choice between two wheelbase lengths of either or . The larger car was fitted with a 6-cylinder 5,325 cc (30 CV/HP) and sat on an impressive chassis. The cars were priced by the manufacturer respectively at 22,500 francs and 40,000 francs in bare chassis form, with tires included.

In October 1924 the Brasier stand at the 19th Paris Motor Show was, as in earlier years, prominently positioned in the central part of the display area, but by now Henri Brasier had switched away from the very large cars he had produced in the immediate post-war years, and was offering the &quot;Brasier Type TB4&quot;, launched in 1923 and powered by a 4-cylinder 2,062 cc (12 CV/HP) engine, set on a wheelbase of only . The currency had continued to lose value following the end of the war and this model was listed at 40,000 francs for a &quot;Torpedo&quot; bodied car and 45,000 francs for a &quot;Conduite interieure&quot; (two-box sedan/saloon/berline) version. By this time, however, the company&#x27;s market-place presence was being progressively eaten into by other, more focused and forward thinking auto-makers.

The cars made after 1926 are known under the name of Chaigneau-Brasier, after the company was bought by the Chaigneau family who had been bicycle makers. The first car made by the new company was the TD-4, a 9 CV 4-cylinder model available as a tourer or saloon. The company appears to have sought a return to its &quot;luxury car&quot; strategy of ten years earlier, now combined with elements of technical innovation for which its traditional customers had not been prepared, introducing a 3-litre OHC-engined front-wheel drive car, described by one commentator as &quot;Utopian&quot;, in 1928 An even larger model followed in 1930. In view of the severe economic downturn crystallised by the Wall Street crash of October 1929, the timing of this venture was unfortunate. The new large Chaigneau-Brasiers attracted plenty of interest at the annual Paris Motor Shows. A journalist described the 3-litre car of 1928 as sitting on &quot;le châssis le plus moderne du salon [1928]&quot; &quot;(&quot;the most modern chassis at the 1928 Paris motor show&quot;)&quot; but it turned out that the car displayed was only a prototype, and it is not clear if any were actually produced for sale. The company fell into acute financial difficulties. With production capacity at the Ivry plant now badly under used, nemesis was postponed by a major investment from Delahaye who were at this time still short of capacity themselves, and were able to transfer some truck production to the Chaigneau-Brasier plant. Chaigneau-Brasier were therefore able to survive, but only until 1930 or 1931. Sources differ.

==Racing==

Léon Théry entered a Brasier in the 1908 French Grand Prix, but surrendered after 9 laps of the 10 lap race.

<text>Sir Maurice Oldfield (16 November 1915 – 11 March 1981) was a British intelligence officer and espionage administrator. He served as the seventh director of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), from 1973 to 1978.

==Early life==
Oldfield was born on 16 November 1915 at his grandmother&#x27;s farm just outside Youlgrave, a village in Derbyshire. He grew up at a house called Mona View in Over Haddon. He was the first of 11 children of Joseph Oldfield, tenant farmer, and his wife, Ada Annie Dicken.

He was educated at Lady Manners School at the nearby market town of Bakewell, before winning a scholarship to the Victoria University of Manchester, where he stayed at Hulme Hall. There, he studied under the historian A. J. P. Taylor and specialised in medieval history. He graduated with a first class degree and was elected to a fellowship.

==Intelligence career==
During the Second World War, Oldfield joined the British Army. Initially a sergeant in Army Field Security (which was absorbed into the Intelligence Corps in 1940), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps in July 1943. Most of his wartime service was in Egypt at the headquarters of SIME (Security Intelligence Middle East) in Cairo. This was primarily a counter-intelligence organisation, the role of which was to detect hostile agents in the region and counter their activities.

By the end of the war, Oldfield had been promoted to major. In 1946, he was awarded an MBE.

After the war, Oldfield joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6. From 1947 to 1949, he was deputy to Brigadier Douglas Roberts, the head of counter-intelligence, with whom he had served in Egypt during the war. After two postings to Singapore (the first as deputy head, the second as head of the SIS regional headquarters) he was appointed a CBE. From 1959, he spent four years as the SIS representative in Washington, D.C. This was a key post, important for the maintenance of good relations between the SIS and the Central Intelligence Agency. On his return, he became director of counter-intelligence and deputy to the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service Sir Dick White. Oldfield was passed over for promotion when Sir John Rennie succeeded White in 1968. He eventually became director when Rennie resigned in 1973; he held this post until his retirement in 1978.

==Retirement==

After retiring from the MI6, Oldfield was a visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford until 1979. Oldfield lived at Marsham Court, an apartment building in Millbank in the City of Westminster from the early 1970s until his death in 1981. A large explosive device was discovered by officers from Special Branch hanging on railings outside Marsham Court on 13 October 1975. The bomb was near Lockett&#x27;s restaurant which was directly under Oldfield&#x27;s flat.
In 1979 the new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, asked Oldfield to coordinate security and intelligence in Northern Ireland.

After his retirement as Chief of the SIS, it emerged that Oldfield was homosexual, resulting in his security clearance being withdrawn shortly before his death in 1981.

Oldfield died in March 1981, aged 65. He is buried next to his parents and sister in St Anne&#x27;s churchyard, Over Haddon, Derbyshire.

==Legacy==

Oldfield was reputedly one of the models for John le Carré&#x27;s fictional character George Smiley, though Le Carré disputes this. In his memoir &quot;The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life&quot; Le Carré describes a lunchtime meeting between Oldfield, himself and Alec Guinness; this was intended to provide the actor with a sense of the manner and appearance of an &quot;old spy in retirement&quot;.

In October 2012, it was reported by the BBC&#x27;s current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, that he had been linked to the Elm Guest House child abuse scandal, supposedly involving senior MPs and security personnel, by the Operation Midland investigation, and a Metropolitan Police informant. The investigation ended without charges, and in 2017 Oldfield was cleared of all allegations of child abuse at Elm Guest House and elsewhere. The accuser in the Operation Midland case, Carl Beech, was subsequently convicted of making up the allegations in 2019.

<text>Richard Oldham (died 1485/86) was a pre-Reformation cleric who served as the Bishop of Sodor and Man in the second half of the 15th century.

He was elected Abbot of Chester in 1455 and appointed Bishop of Sodor and Man on 11 or 15 February 1478, holding both posts until his death. Contemporary records reveal some acrimony between Oldham and the townsfolk of Chester. In 1474 and 1478, the Exchequer of Chester guaranteed his safety and that of his monks, and in a later turnaround of events in 1480 he and twelve fellow monks were themselves bound over to keep the peace in the city.

He died in office either on 13 October 1485 or 19 September 1486 and was buried at Chester Abbey.

<text>Oleg (), Oleh (), or [[Aleh]] () is an East Slavic given name. The name is very common in Russia, Ukraine, and Belаrus. 

==Origins==
&quot;Oleg&quot; derives from the Old Norse &quot;Helgi&quot; (Helge), meaning &quot;holy&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;, or &quot;blessed&quot;. The feminine equivalent is Olga. While Germanic in origin, &quot;Oleg&quot; is not very common outside Eastern European countries, while &quot;Helge&quot; and &quot;Helga&quot; are common names in Scandinavia.

==Russian pronunciation==
Олег (Oleg) is pronounced [ɐˈlʲek] in Russian. The English pronunciation of Oleg is based on the transliteration of the Cyrillic alphabet, and overlooks four key features of the Russian pronunciation:

# The stress is on the second syllable. In spoken Russian, the initial short unstressed &#x27;O&#x27; is reduced to [ɐ], similar to the &#x27;a&#x27; as in &#x27;about&#x27;.
# The &#x27;л&#x27; (l) becomes palatalized to [lʲ] ─ that is, it gains a &#x27;y&#x27;-like quality, and but is still most closely approximated by a plain English &#x27;l&#x27;.
# The Russian letter &#x27;e&#x27; is pronounced &#x27;ye&#x27; as in &#x27;yellow&#x27;.
# The final &#x27;г&#x27; (g) is devoiced to [k].

Thus although English speakers tend to pronounce the name as &#x27;Óh-legg&#x27;, in Russian it sounds more like &#x27;Al-yék&#x27;, the equivalent of Alec.

==Ukrainian pronunciation==

The Ukrainian pronunciation of the name &#x27;Олег&#x27; is different from Russian, though the same Cyrillic letters are used in writing. Ukrainian &#x27;Олег&#x27; is pronounced [oˈlɛɦ] and becomes &#x27;Oleh&#x27; in English according to the transliteration rules.

== Belarusian spelling and pronunciation ==
In Belarusian, the name is spelled and pronounced as &quot;Алег&quot; [aˈlʲeɣ] so that the first letter changes to &quot;A&quot; according to the Belarusian feature of akannye. The last letter is also pronounced differently, which renders the Latin transliteration &#x27;Aleh&#x27;.

<text>See You Later is an album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in November 1980. It breaks quite violently with the style he employed in the late 1970s and later, relying much more on vocals and being more experimental and returning (in many respects) to his early 1970s work like &quot;Earth&quot; or &quot;666&quot;. It was never released in the United States, until it was remastered in 2016 as part of the &quot;Delectus&quot; boxset.

==Overview==
&quot;See You Later&quot; is Vangelis&#x27; most wide-ranging work of the 1980s, with more radical musical and lyrical themes than are found in his other albums. The concept album is bleaker than most of his records, incorporating negative and satirical intonations of a dystopian future. Subjects touched on include funerals, masks, and ready-to-wear and ready-to-eat things.

The lyrics are written by Vangelis in English, French and Italian; they use electronic terminology and incorporate references to lost love, and the downfall of humanity due to the influence of technology. The title track lyrics say &quot;See you later then... alive or dead&quot;. Track &quot;Suffocation&quot; was inspired by the Seveso disaster in Italy.

The album&#x27;s sleeve shows an ice-covered ocean with a young woman wearing sunglasses to protect her eyes; the image uses optical compression in the horizontal axis. The inner sleeve is also disturbing, displaying a character seated in a greenhouse holding a lifeless child in its hands, both wearing eerie-looking gas masks.

==Instruments and style==
Vangelis plays all instruments: synthesizers, electric piano, grand piano and drums. The Korg KR-55 drum machine is used extensively. Michel Ripoche plays the violin on #4. Vocals featured are by Jon Anderson (tracks #5 and #6), Peter Marsh (track #1), Christina and Maurizio Arcieri from the group Krisma (track #5) and Cherry Vanilla (track #4 narrative).

==Composition==
&quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It Anymore&quot; is sung by Peter Marsh through a vocoder over a deep synthesizer glissando bass and a synthesizer choir.

&quot;Memories of Green&quot; is a slow piano-based piece with a backdrop of synthesizer sounds and bleeps from the 1978 Bambino electronic game &quot;UFO Master Blaster Station&quot;. The piano used on this piece was a Steinway Grand piano. Its distinctive &quot;drunk&quot; sound was achieved with the use of an Electroharmonix Electric Mistress flanger pedal. This song was used in Vangelis&#x27; subsequent soundtrack to the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

&quot;Not A Bit – All Of It&quot; has vocals by Cherry Vanilla. &quot;Suffocation&quot; features vocals by Jon Anderson and a narrative in Italian, by Krisma (Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser). &quot;See You Later&quot; has Vangelis on electric piano and staccato male atonal choir. About halfway through, there is a child narrative in French, with Anderson&#x27;s vocals used in the finale.

==Track listing==

<text>Caspar Olevian (or Kaspar Olevianus; 10 August 1536 – 15 March 1587) was a significant German Reformed theologian during the Protestant Reformation and along with Zacharias Ursinus was said to be co-author of the Heidelberg Catechism. That theory of authorship has been questioned by some modern scholarship.

== Life ==
Born in Trier, Olevian was the son of a baker and attended a course of humanist studies in Paris. He went on to study law at Bourges and came under the influence of Reformation teaching. On his return to Trier his beliefs came into conflict with those of the local clergy.

In 1560 he was invited by Frederick III, Elector Palatine to teach at the University of Heidelberg. After the Elector&#x27;s death his son Louis VI, Elector Palatine, who was strongly Lutheran in conviction, attempted to turn the school away from the Reformed doctrine of the Heidelberg catechism. Olevianus was banned from teaching but he was able to move to Berleburg. There, in 1578, he published a commentary on the &quot;Epistle to the Galatians&quot;, with a preface by Theodore Beza.

Olevianus published several works on the Covenant of Grace. In 1584 he moved to the County of Nassau and became rector of Herborn Academy. He died in 1587 surrounded by friends and supporters and was buried in Herborn. On his deathbed he was asked &quot;Are you undoubtedly sure of your salvation, as you taught others constantly?&quot; His reply was &quot;Most certain!&quot;

<text>Holger Thiele (September 25, 1878 – June 5, 1946) was a Danish American astronomer and discoverer of minor planets and comets.

He was the son of Thorvald Nicolai Thiele (1838–1910), the noted Danish astronomer, actuary and mathematician, after whom the main-belt asteroid 1586 Thiele is named.

Holger Thiele is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 4 numbered asteroids during 1914–1916. He also discovered the comet C/1906 V1 and calculated the orbits of other comets. He worked at Hamburg-Bergedorf Observatory at Bergedorf, in Hamburg, Germany. In 1912, he immigrated to the United States.

In 1917, he started working as a fellow for the University of California at Lick Observatory, near San Jose, California. Holger Thiele died in Alameda County in 1946.

<text>Nereu de Oliveira Ramos (; 3 September 1888 – 16 June 1958) was a Brazilian political figure. He briefly served as interim president of Brazil in the aftermath of the political crisis which culminated in the suicide of President Getúlio Vargas and the impeachment of Deputy Carlos Luz and President Café Filho.

==Biography==

===Political career===
Ramos was Vice President of the Republic between 1946 and 1951. The 1945 presidential elections were held for the office of president only, but the Constitution adopted on 18 September 1946 created the office of vice president, and established that the Constituent Assembly would choose the first vice president and swear him in, in the day following the promulgation of the Constitution. Nereu Ramos, until then a senator for Santa Catarina and a member of the Constituent Assembly, was elected vice president in that special election. In his capacity as Vice President of the Republic, Ramos served as President of the Senate. He served as the president of the Chamber of Deputies from 1951 to 1955.

Ramos was re–elected in 1954 to the Federal Senate as a representative from Santa Catarina. He became the Senate&#x27;s President &quot;pro tempore&quot; in the following year. By this stage President Getúlio Vargas had taken his own life. There followed a series of brief presidential reigns: Vargas&#x27;s vice president and successor, Café Filho, took a leave of absence, declaring himself unable to discharge the powers of the presidency due to poor health. By the time President Café Filho took his leave of absence, presidential elections for the next five–year term had been held, and Juscelino Kubitschek had been elected. Many people suspected that there would be a coup d&#x27;état to prevent the inauguration of the President–elect. Army Minister Henrique Teixeira Lott subscribed to that view, and he considered that President Café Filho had taken his leave of absence because he was in agreement with the supposed coup forces but unwilling to lead the coup himself. His leave of absence allowed the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Carlos Luz, to assume the presidency as Acting President, and Luz was seen as hostile to the inauguration of the President–elect and likely to lead a coup to prevent it. Thus, only 48 hours after Café Filho&#x27;s declaration of incapacity and the assumption of the powers of the presidency by Carlos Luz, Army Minister Lott led what he called a &quot;preventive counter-coup&quot; aimed at securing the inauguration of the President–elect chosen by the people, by avoiding the supposed coup that Luz would allegedly lead. In that preventive counter-coup, Luz was deposed, Café Filho was prohibited from resuming the powers and duties of the presidency (although he was not deposed, he was kept under house arrest for the remaining three months of his presidential term, and was barred from declaring his incapacity terminated), and the next man in the line of presidential succession, Senator Nereu Ramos, the Senate&#x27;s President &quot;pro tempore&quot; assumed the powers of the presidency in the place of Carlos Luz.

Ramos assumed the presidency on 11 November 1955, to complete Vargas&#x27;s term. He served until January 31, 1956, whereupon President–elect Kubitschek was inaugurated. Ramos was the last president to have been born in the Empire of Brazil.

==Death==
Nereu Ramos died in a Cruzeiro airline crash on 16 June 1958, near Curitiba Afonso Pena International Airport.

<text>The City is a 1990 album by the Greek artist Vangelis. Reportedly, it was produced entirely in a Rome hotel room, where Vangelis was staying to witness the filming of the Roman Polanski film &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; (for which he&#x27;d been commissioned to write the soundtrack). It can be seen as a concept album, citing concepts from urban life and alluding to the big city atmosphere. The album peaked at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums chart.

== Track listing ==
All tracks written by Vangelis.

== Instruments ==
Vangelis plays all instruments: exclusively synthesisers and drum machines. Spoken-word vocals are contributed by various guest artists (Kathy Hill on &quot;Good to See You&quot;; Mikamo Yuko and Kimura Rieko on &quot;Twilight&quot; and &quot;Red Lights&quot;), with recorded footsteps and vocal narrative at points throughout the album by Roman Polanski and Emmanuelle Seigner.

== Style ==
Vangelis employs a wide range of styles, from jazz (2) and rock (3) to new age (5, 6). Instrument patches are all synthesizer-based, but sound very convincing (trumpet on 1, guitar on 3, cello on 8).

Although &quot;The City&quot; is the first album after &quot;Direct&quot; (1988), there is no mention of the &quot;Direct series&quot; as discussed in that album&#x27;s sleeve notes. It can also not be easily linked with his subsequent work, such as the &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot; soundtrack.

<text>Trub is one of the largest municipalities of Switzerland (62 km²) in size, but not in population. It is located in the Emmental region of the canton of Bern in the administrative district of Emmental.

==History==
Trub is first mentioned in 1139 as &quot;Truoba&quot;. Around 1258 it was mentioned as &quot;Trouba&quot;.

Much of the early history of Trub is tied to the Benedictine Trub Abbey, which ruled over much of the modern municipality. The inhabitants of the village were ruled from the Abbey and were partly under ecclesiastical law, though the high court was under the secular Kyburgs. In 1408 Bern acquired the remaining Kyburg lands including the high court rights in Trub. During the early 15th century the population of the village dropped and many of the outlying farms were abandoned. As the population recovered in the second half of that century, many alpine meadows and small settlements were once opened up.

In 1528, Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and secularized all monasteries, including Trub. The land and lower courts in Trub came under Bernese control. The monastery church has always been the village church. It was converted into a Protestant church and the patronage rights passed to Bern. The original church was probably a Romanesque building. It was replaced with the current building in 1641-45, though some of the walls come from the earlier building.

Following the Protestant Reformation, a number of Anabaptists settled in Trub, which caused problems with the government in Bern. In 1532, the village was ordered to drive out all its Anabaptists, though many remained. Over the following centuries, until 1742 when it was finally no longer illegal, Anabaptist hunters would occasionally visit Trub to attempt to capture them. Several homes in the community, including the house at Hintere Hütte nr. 239, had special hidden rooms that the Anabaptists could hide in to avoid the hunters.

Following the 1798 French invasion, Trub became part of the Helvetic Republic district of Oberemmental. Five years later, following the collapse of the Republic and 1803 Act of Mediation, it was transferred to the Oberamt Signau.

In the 16th century dairy and cheese production became a major part of the local economy. Bernese patricians gradually bought up all the high alpine meadows, which they then leased back to the local dairy farmers. The valley floors were used to raise hay for the cattle when they were brought back down to spend winters on the valley floor. As the population grew and agriculture became more regulated and less labor-intensive, many residents were forced to emigrate beginning in the 18th century. Despite emigration, many residents lived in poverty and in 1810 a hospital for the poor opened in Trub. So many citizens emigrated that today 1 in 147 Swiss can trace their roots back to Trub. The construction of various valley roads between 1832 and 1860 as well as the construction of a train station of the Bern-Lucerne Railroad in Trubschachen in 1875 helped open up the village to industry. The economy shifted from agriculture to processing wood, building automotive parts, transporting goods and the services industry. In 2010 the municipality had two school houses in Trub and Fankhaus.

==Geography==
Trub has an area of . As of 2012, a total of or 40.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 56.0% is forested. The rest of the municipality is or 2.3% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.8% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.3% is unproductive land.

The large, mostly rural municipality is located on the southern slopes of the Napf mountain and includes both banks of the Ilfis river. It consists of the village of Trub, the neighborhoods of Brandösch, Fankhaus, Twären and Gummen, the business development of Kröschenbrunnen as well as scattered farm houses and alpine meadows.

On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Signau, the municipality&#x27;s former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Emmental.

==Demographics==
Today, Trub has just under 1,370 inhabitants (2012), but as a result of centuries of emigration from the Emmental region, over 50,000 people are registered as citizens of the Trub Bürgergemeinde. Under Swiss law it includes all individuals who are citizens of the Bürgergemeinde, usually by having inherited the Bürgerrecht (citizenship), regardless of where they were born or where they may currently live. Instead of the place of birth, Swiss legal documents, e.g. passports, contain the Bürgerort (place of citizenship).

<doc id="758815" wikidata="Q95676" url="?curid=758815" title="Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff">
<text>Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff (also later known as Henri Godefroy Ollendorff) (1803, Rawicz near Poznań – 3 April 1865, Paris) was a German grammarian and language educator, whose &quot;modern method&quot; of learning foreign languages came into vogue from the 1840s.

==Life and career==
After graduating as a doctor of philosophy at the University of Jena, Ollendorff emigrated to London, where he developed &quot;la méthode Ollendorff&quot; (the Ollendorff method), a new way of learning foreign languages based on oral communication rather than on textual comprehension as used in the traditional &quot;grammar translation&quot; method. He refined this method over the years. He became a language teacher in Paris in 1830 and published textbooks there for various languages, including German, French, Italian, Spanish, Modern Greek, Latin and other languages.

His work &quot;Méthode de l&#x27;allemand à l&#x27;usage des français&quot; (1833) was approved for public teaching in French schools by the French Minister of Education, Narcisse-Achille de Salvandy.

The popularity of his works and the fact that French copyright law did not apply in Frankfurt am Main led to pirated copies being printed in that city by the publishing house Carl Jügel (under the name of Charles Jugel at the German and Foreign Library). In 1850 Ollendorff brought a legal case against a London bookseller, Alexander Black, for importing pirated copies of one of his books purported to have been printed in Frankfurt am Main.

In 1898 Antonin Nantel&#x27;s &quot;Nouveau cours de langue anglaise selon la méthode d&#x27;Ollendorff à l&#x27;usage des écoles, académies, pensionnats et colléges&quot;, an English primer based on the Ollendorff method was published by the Montreal publisher Librairie Beauchemin for use in French-speaking schools in Canada.

==La méthode Ollendorff==
Ollendorff was heavily indebted to an early &quot;modern method&quot; teacher, Jean (John) Manesca, who appears to have written the first fully developed modern method language course in the early 1820s. That work was designed for French, and Ollendorff was keen to see it adopted for other modern and classical languages. He would in the decades from the 1830s write and publish numerous foreign languages primers (firstly for modern languages and then for classical languages) based on Manesca&#x27;s methodology and adding features of his own, which he promoted as &quot;la méthode Ollendorff&quot;.

In the 1840s Ollendorff also wrote the first post-Renaissance textbook for conversational Latin, the &quot;Nouvelle méthode pour apprendre, à lire, a écrire et à parler une langue en six mois, appliquée au Latin&quot;. Ollendorff&#x27;s French text contains little on grammar, and is almost entirely intuitive, with learning based on practice alone, not theory. George J. Adler&#x27;s American edition is an extensive revision of Ollendorff&#x27;s first attempt, including grammar; this version of the Ollendorff text has 600 pages of very fine print, with copious exercises. Adler also expanded and re-wrote the Latin text, resulting a much higher quality textbook, with more elegant Latin, and a wider variety of examples based on the historical classic sources.

Again following Manesca, Ollendorf wrote foreign language teaching books not only for modern languages but also for the classical languages. Manesca had written:

If I have not spoken of the advantages that may be derived from the present mode of teaching applied to dead languages, it is not because I entertain the smallest doubt of its efficacy in that particular; for, on the contrary, I am confident that many years of toilsome, tedious, and almost fruitless labours, would be saved by the adoption of such a method for these languages. A well disposed young man, between eighteen and twenty, well versed in the principles of his mother tongue, would, in twelve months, acquire a sufficient knowledge of Latin or Greek for all the purposes of life. Such a consideration well deserves the attention of the few scholars competent for a task which would prove so beneficial to the present and future generation of collegiate students. The present modes of teaching the dead languages are sadly defective. It is high time that a rational, uniform method should be adopted.

The French-Latin Ollendorff was, as far as can be ascertained, the first textbook written in modern times aimed at teaching Latin as a spoken language, using &quot;modern&quot; methods. Manesca&#x27;s method was never translated directly into Latin or Greek for publication, although it did appear in a Spanish edition written by Carlos Rabadan. The utopian socialist Albert Brisbane describes in his biography, &quot;Albert Brisbane: A Mental Biography&quot; (1893), in some detail his private classes in French and Spanish with Manesca in New York, says that he studied Latin using the same method. If Manesca ever wrote up any Latin exercises, perhaps they only survive in manuscript among his papers. The Ollendorff version went through several editions, and was quite popular for private pupils, but it was never taken up by schools for teaching Latin. Adler&#x27;s American edition seems to have suffered the same fate, and original copies of it are very hard to come by, although it is now available as a reprint.

The Ollendorff method likely influenced the development of other well-known 19th century foreign language learning methods, for example, the Method Gaspey-Otto-Sauer which was widely used until the 1950s.

==In popular literature==
===H. G. Wells===
Ollendorff&#x27;s name is used as an epithet in H.G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;:

&quot;&quot;Yesterday he bled and wept,&quot; said the Satyr. &quot;You never bleed nor weep. The Master does not bleed or weep.&quot;
&quot;Ollendorffian beggar!&quot; said Montgomery, &quot;you&#x27;ll bleed and weep if you don&#x27;t look out!&quot;&quot;

Montgomery is mocking the Satyr&#x27;s repetitive discourse, as Ollendorff&#x27;s texts rely heavily on repetition, likening this to playing musical scales. They also use artificially constructed sentences, which, while illustrating grammar and tense well enough, are extremely unlikely to occur in real life.

===Mark Twain===
Mark Twain ridicules Ollendorf&#x27;s sentences––questions in particular––for just that quality. In Chapter XXX of his &quot;Roughing It&quot; (1872), a memoir of his years in Nevada and California, he writes:

&quot;Before leaving Carson, the Secretary and I had purchased &#x27;feet&#x27; from various Esmeralda stragglers. We had expected immediate returns of bullion, but were only afflicted with regular and constant &#x27;assessments&#x27; instead—demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines. These assessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into the matter personally. Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and thence to Esmeralda. I bought a horse and started, in company with Mr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff, a Prussian—not the party who has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched foreign grammars, with their interminable repetitions of questions which never have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation among human beings.&quot;
Twain has in mind such sentences as the following, which appear in &quot;Nouvelle Méthode de H. G. Ollendorff Pour Apprendre À Lire, À Écrire Et À Parler Une Langue Clef de la grammaire anglaise à l&#x27;usage des français, ou Traduction des thèmes contenus dans cet ouvrage&quot;, an Ollendoffian primer meant to teach English to speakers of French:

&quot;Have you any more partridges ? — No, Sir, I have sent them all to my uncle. — Do you want any more paper? — I want a great deal. — How many pair of scissors have you left? — I have six pair left. — Of whom do you speak? — I speak of the lazy scholars of the good teachers. — Of which teachers ? — Of those whom you know. — At what o&#x27;clock do you come back from your shop? — I usually come back at a quarter before eight. — Is the young Frenchman, who lives at your house, still at home? — Yes, he is still at home, but in bed. — Why is he in bed so late? — He came back from the theatre at about midnight or a quarter past twelve yesterday, and now he has the head-ache. — When does he usually go out in the morning? — He usually goes out at a quarter or twenty minutes past nine. — Do you come home late in the night? — No, I usually come home about ten o&#x27;clock. — Do you go immediately to bed? — Yes, I go immediately to bed, but I read a long time in my bed. — It is a bad habit, it spoils your eyes, and you could set your bed-room on fire. — Is your brother here? — He is somewhere, but not here. — Is he at home? — No, he is somewhere else. — Where do you go to-night? — I go into the country. — Does your brother go there also? — No, he goes nowhere.&quot;

===Rudyard Kipling===
In his account in his &quot;From Sea to Sea&quot; of a visit to Yellowstone National Park, Rudyard Kipling complains: &quot;Be it known that the Park is laid out, like Ollendorf, in exercises of progressive difficulty.&quot;

===P. G. Wodehouse===
In his first novel &quot;The Pothunters&quot;, (1902), P. G. Wodehouse references Ollendorf: 

&quot;Mr. Robert. Is he in?&quot; It seemed to Charteris that the form of this question smacked of Ollendorf. He half expected the servant to say &quot;No, but he has the mackintosh of his brother&#x27;s cousin.&quot;
He later references his repetitive phrases in his novella &quot;The Swoop!&quot; (1909):

&quot;Did you put that paper on this looking-glass?&quot; he shouted.

&quot;I did not put that paper on that looking-glass,&quot; replied Clarence precisely.

&quot;Ah,&quot; said the Grand Duke, &quot;if you had, I&#x27;d have come and wrung your neck like a chicken, and scattered you to the four corners of this dressing-room.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t,&quot; said Clarence.

&quot;Have you read this paper on the looking-glass?&quot;

&quot;I have not read that paper on the looking-glass,&quot; replied Clarence, whose chief fault as a conversationalist was that he was perhaps a shade too Ollendorfian.

<doc id="758821" wikidata="Q74322" url="?curid=758821" title="WWE Hardcore Championship">
<text>The WWE Hardcore Championship was a hardcore wrestling championship in the WWF (Now WWE) which was contested under &quot;hardcore&quot; rules (no disqualifications, no countouts, and pinfalls count anywhere). In the latter part of the title&#x27;s history, a rule was implemented allowing anyone to challenge the champion at any place or time, provided a referee was present (dubbed the &quot;24/7 rule&quot;). It is considered one of the most defining titles of the Attitude Era. It was established on November 2, 1998, with Mankind as the inaugural champion. In 2002, it was unified with the WWE Intercontinental Championship by Rob Van Dam, the final Hardcore Champion.

== History ==
=== Ratification ===
During a storyline where The Corporation was manipulating Mankind, Vince McMahon awarded the taped-up, broken championship belt to Mankind as a backhanded compliment to keep him away from WWF Championship contention. Rather than reject the dilapidated title belt, Mankind embraced it with gratitude, calling McMahon &quot;dad,&quot; to the disgust of The Corporation. The title was won by the Big Boss Man a month later, and was then defended as a regular title.

=== 24/7 rule ===
When Crash Holly won the belt, he introduced the &quot;24/7 rule&quot; that the belt was to be defended at all times as long as a referee was present. This allowed for many comic relief moments, such as the belt changing hands while the champion was asleep(Crash Holly lost the title while he was sleeping to Gerald Brisco), and The Headbangers chasing Crash Holly around an amusement park in Brooklyn (Holly eventually escaped from a ball pit and ran from the building, still the champion).

At WrestleMania X8, Maven defended the title against Goldust. After they knocked each other out with trash can lids, Spike Dudley entered and pinned Maven to win the title. Then, in the backstage area, The Hurricane pinned Spike for the title. Mighty Molly (The Hurricane&#x27;s sidekick) told The Hurricane to go to the &quot;Hurri-cycle&quot; before knocking him out with a frying pan when his back was turned and pinning him. While looking for a safe place, Christian won the title by pinning Molly after hitting her in the head with a door. As he was about to leave the building in a taxi, he was attacked and pinned by Maven, who regained the title and escaped in the taxi.

Trish Stratus faced Jazz (managed by then-Hardcore Champion Stevie Richards) for the Women&#x27;s Championship, and lost due to Richards&#x27; interference. After the match, Bubba Ray Dudley attacked Richards from behind and pinned him for the title. Raven appeared and pinned Dudley, but quickly lost the title to Justin Credible, who was then pinned by Crash Holly. Dudley hit Holly with a trash can, but Stratus stole the pin on him. Dudley tried to attack Stratus from behind, but Jazz sprayed him with a fire extinguisher. Richards then stole the final pin of the night after Dudley accidentally powerbombed Stratus through a wooden table.

This rule has allowed the shortest title reigns and quickest title changes in WWE history.

Four women have held the Hardcore Championship: Molly Holly (as Mighty Molly), Trish Stratus, Terri Runnels, and The Godfather&#x27;s ho.

The championship often changed hands at house shows, to give the audience a &quot;big moment&quot;. In the end, the title always returned to its original holder.

At WrestleMania 2000, a battle royal match, in the style of Championship Scramble was booked where the title changed hands 10 times during the 15 minutes. The eventual winner was Hardcore Holly, Tazz, Viscera, Funaki, Rodney, Joey Abs, Thrasher, Pete Gas, and Crash Holly all held the title for varying times throughout the match, usually for very short periods of time. The longest reign in the match was Viscera holding the title for nearly seven minutes.

Between the Invasion storyline and WrestleMania X8, the &quot;24/7&quot; rule was only used twice, during matches on the &quot;Raw Is War&quot; episodes of August 13, 2001 and September 10, 2001 respectively. Both matches were coincidentally between Kurt Angle and Rob Van Dam. On the August 13 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Jeff Hardy interfered and brought a referee with him, and pinned Van Dam for the title, setting up a match for them at that year&#x27;s SummerSlam. On the September 10 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, however, Angle won the match, then was thrown off the entrance ramp by Stone Cold Steve Austin, who then also threw Van Dam off the ramp too. Van Dam landed on Angle and a referee counted the pin.

After the Invasion storyline, The Undertaker won the title from Van Dam. He defended against numerous opponents (usually smaller than him) and assaulted them after the matches (with the exception of Big Show). Although the 24/7 rule was still in effect during his reign, The Undertaker was not challenged by others under the rule; in storyline, commentator Jim Ross attributed this fact to no wrestler being &quot;stupid enough&quot; to do so.

The 24/7 rule ended on August 19, 2002 when &quot;Raw&quot; general manager Eric Bischoff suspended it before a six-minute hardcore battle royal, won by Tommy Dreamer. Previously, a 24-hour suspension on the rule was in place for Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy&#x27;s match at WWF Invasion. Commissioner Mick Foley also suspended the rule while Shane McMahon held the title, to ensure he was still the champion at SummerSlam, to defend against Steve Blackman, whom he cheated out of the belt.

On May 20, 2019, WWE unveiled a new championship, the WWE 24/7 Championship, which was contested under the same 24/7 rule.

=== Unification and retirement ===
The title was unified with the Intercontinental Championship on August 26, 2002, when Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated Hardcore Champion Tommy Dreamer. This was one month after Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy in a ladder match to unify the Intercontinental and European Championships.

=== Sporadic appearances ===
On the June 23, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mick Foley (who was the first champion, as &quot;Mankind&quot;) was awarded the Hardcore Championship belt (but not the championship) by the &quot;Raw&quot; authority figure Stone Cold Steve Austin for his contributions to hardcore wrestling.

On May 22, 2006, Edge and Foley declared themselves co-holders of the championship as part of a storyline involving alumni of the hardcore wrestling-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion and were brought to ECW One Night Stand when they and Lita fought Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk, and Beulah McGillicutty in an intergender tag team Extreme Rules match. The title was not defended and soon quietly disappeared.

In November, 2024, Triple H appeared at a Travis Scott concert and handed him a new Hardcore Championship belt, this one based on the modern WWE Championship belt, while declaring him the &#x27;new&#x27; WWE Hardcore Champion.

=== Origin of the belt ===
The Hardcore Championship belt was rumored to have been a replica of the &quot;Winged Eagle&quot; WWF Championship belt, which was smashed in several places and reassembled with two pieces of duct tape, and inscribed with the words &quot;Hardcore&quot; and &quot;Champion&quot; in marker. During a feud between &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; Curt Hennig and then-champion Hulk Hogan, Hennig stole the championship belt and smashed the center medallion with a hammer during an interview. As Hennig had done so much genuine damage, a replica belt had to be used for the remainder of the story line. The center medallion on the replica and the Hardcore championship is identical. Mick Foley commented that he did not know if the belt that Hennig smashed was later used as the Hardcore Championship, but quipped that &quot;it makes ‘perfect’ sense.&quot; WWE listed this theory as one of its urban legends, but was unable to determine whether it is true. The original belt was later sold as memorabilia by former WWE employee Mel Phillips and authenticated by belt makers Dave Millican and Reggie Parks, thus debunking the longtime rumor.

When Bradshaw won the title in June 2002, he briefly renamed it the Texas Hardcore Championship, and wore a Smoking Skull belt customized with the Texas flag, artificial bull horns and a Bullrope on the centerplate. 

Tommy Dreamer, in the last title defense of the Hardcore Championship, used a variation of the belt with a New York license plate as a centerplate, over a replica of a European Championship. The reason for these changes was because the original belt had become so damaged from wear and tear.

Travis Scott&#x27;s version of the belt is a replica of the original black &quot;Big Network&quot; WWE Championship belt, with the original duct tape and marker &#x27;label&#x27; as the original belt, due to the fact the original Hardcore Championship belt being now in the hands of Mick Foley, and WWE&#x27;s own standardization of belt designs. 

== Reigns ==

Mr. McMahon awarded Mankind the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Hardcore Championship on November 2, 1998. After Mankind lost the title to Big Boss Man, he never attempted to recapture the title, mainly because of the main event push he received shortly afterward. At the time of conception, the idea was for the belt to be used in comedy segments to play on Mankind&#x27;s reputation as a hardcore wrestler. However, as Mankind and hardcore wrestling became more popular with audiences, the Hardcore Championship became a more serious title. Its popularity led competitor World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to create its own Hardcore Championship, a move followed by numerous independent promotions.

<text>Culbert Levy Olson (November 7, 1876 – April 13, 1962) was an American lawyer and politician. A Democratic Party member, Olson was involved in Utah and California politics. He was elected to both the Utah State Senate and California State Senate serving one term in each. As a result of the 1938 California gubernatorial election he was elected as the 29th governor of California, where he served from 1939 to 1943. During his time as governor, Olson struggled to pass New Deal legislation due to hostility from the California legislature. He also supported the internment and removal of Japanese Americans from California after the United States entered World War Two. He was the first atheist governor of an American state.

==Early life and education==
Olson was born in Fillmore, Utah, the son of Delilah Cornelia (née King) and George Daniel Olson, on November 7, 1876. Olson&#x27;s mother was a suffragette and became the first female elected official in Utah. His first cousin was U.S. Senator William H. King, and both were descendants of Edmund Rice, an early immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Olson&#x27;s mother and father belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, Culbert was unconvinced of the existence of God, and became an atheist at the age of ten.

Leaving school at the age of 14, Olson worked briefly as a telegraph operator. In 1890, he enrolled at Brigham Young University in Provo, where he studied law and journalism.

== Career ==
Upon graduating at the age of 19 in 1895, Olson embarked on a career as a journalist with the &quot;Daily Ogden Standard&quot;. During the 1896 presidential election, Olson campaigned for Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan. After the election, Olson moved briefly to Michigan, studying law at the University of Michigan, and then later to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a newspaper correspondent and secretary for the U.S. Congress. During his time in the capital, Olson attended law school at George Washington University, and he was admitted to the Utah Bar in 1901.

===Utah and California Legislature===
Olson moved back to Utah in 1901, settling in Salt Lake City to join a law practice. Building a reputation of defending trade unionists and political progressives, Olson was elected to the Utah State Senate in 1916. During his four years in the State Senate, Olson wrote and endorsed legislation to end child labor in the state, guarantee old age pensions, and expand government control of public utilities.

Olson declined to run again for the State Senate in the 1920 general election. Instead, Olson relocated to Los Angeles, California, beginning another law practice, where he again gained a reputation of investigating corporate fraud. Politics never remained far. Olson campaigned openly for Progressive Party candidate Robert La Follette in 1924, and for Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.

In 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression, Olson ran as a Democrat for the California State Senate, representing Los Angeles. During the 1934 state general elections, Olson campaigned for former Socialist Party member and Democratic nominee for governor, Upton Sinclair, participating in Sinclair&#x27;s End Poverty in California campaign. While Sinclair lost the gubernatorial election to Republican Frank Merriam, Olson was elected to the California State Senate that year.

While in the state Senate, the second state legislative seat to which he was elected, Olson openly supported Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies towards the unemployed. Seeing large business interests as a barrier to change, Olson wrote the Olson Oil Bill to cut down oil company monopolies in the state.

==1938 Gubernatorial Bid==
With the open support of President Roosevelt, Olson ran for governor of California in the 1938 general elections against conservative Republican and anti-labor incumbent Governor Frank Merriam. Merriam, known for suppressing the 1934 Longshore Strike and his conservative fiscal policies, was a highly unpopular candidate among progressives and unionists, with even conservative Republicans angered by his 1935 tax reforms. Merriam lost soundly to Olson. He was the first Democrat to win the governorship since James Budd&#x27;s election in 1894, breaking the 40-year Democrat isolation from the governorship.

===Governor of California 1939-1943===

Olson was inaugurated as California&#x27;s twenty-ninth executive on January 2, 1939, and was the first Democrat to serve as governor of California in 40 years. In his inaugural address, Olson pointed at progressives and the Left for his inspiration, citing that &quot;[t]hey point the way forward - toward the achievement of the aspiration of the people for an economy that will afford general employment, abundant production, equitable distribution, social security and old age retirement, which our country, with its ample resources, great facilities and the genius of its people, is capable of providing.&quot;

Olson refused to say &quot;so help me God&quot; during his oath of office to state Supreme Court Justice William H. Waste. Olson remarked earlier to Justice Waste that &quot;God couldn&#x27;t help me at all, and that there isn&#x27;t any such person.&quot; Instead, Olson said, &quot;I will affirm.&quot;

Olson&#x27;s tenure in the governorship got off to a rocky start. He collapsed four days after his inauguration, and doctors discovered that he was suffering from an ailing heart. On top of personal health matters, Kate Jeremy Olson, the Governor&#x27;s wife of nearly thirty-nine years, died shortly after he assumed the office.

Contrasting with the conservative policies of Governor Frank Merriam, Olson promoted friendly relations with the state&#x27;s labor unions. In September 1939, he officially pardoned Tom Mooney, a labor activist and political prisoner accused of plotting the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco. Olson cited scant evidence against Mooney as the reason for his pardon. The next month, Olson pardoned Mooney&#x27;s alleged accomplice, Warren Billings.

Olson&#x27;s relationship with the California State Legislature was often bitter. With conservative Democrats controlling the Assembly, and business-friendly Republicans in the Senate, Olson had little room to promote his New Deal politics, while the Legislature remained wary of Olson&#x27;s leftist agenda. In the first year of his governorship, Olson&#x27;s proposed budget was cut by nearly 100 million dollars, and his proposal of compulsory universal health insurance for every Californian was defeated. The Legislature also defeated legislation to raise income, bank and corporate taxes, as well as Olson&#x27;s bills to regulate lobbyists and reform the state penal system. State-subsidized relief for farmers was cut nearly in half. Olson installed a telephone hotline to the Legislature to get immediate word of lawmakers&#x27; positions on bills in committee or on the floor for a vote.

During his tenure, Olson grew increasingly critical of the Roman Catholic Church and its presence in the state educational system, and raised the ire of Archbishops John J. Cantwell of Los Angeles and John J. Mitty of San Francisco. A secular atheist, Olson was disturbed by the state legislature&#x27;s passage of two bills in 1941, one to give free transportation to students attending Catholic schools, and the other to release Catholic children from public schools in the middle of the school day in order to attend catechism, leaving the schools and other students idle until the Catholic students returned. Olson signed the first bill into law, later citing the enormous pressure of the Catholic Church on his office and on state lawmakers, but he vetoed the second (&quot;early release&quot;) bill.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the entry of the United States into the Second World War, many in California feared a Japanese invasion. In the wake of the attack, Olson urged calm from Californians. In a plea for racial tolerance, broadcast on December 14, he stated he had assurances from &quot;every racial group&quot; of their loyalty and devotion to the United States, even reading a telegram he had received from a Japanese citizen. Olson attempted to revoke the business licenses of &quot;enemy alien&quot; Japanese in California. (Japanese immigrants were prohibited by law from becoming U.S. citizens and were therefore permanent aliens, although many had resided in California for decades.) On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, allowing U.S. military commanders to create zones from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; Based on that, all West Coast Japanese Americans, including American-born Nisei and Sansei, in addition to the non-citizen Issei, were forcibly relocated to isolated internment camps over the next several months.

The pro-internment recommendations of General John L. DeWitt (head of the Western Defense Command) were embarrassing for Governor Olson. On February 2, 1942, the Governor, following a meeting with DeWitt, said that mass evacuation would not be necessary; DeWitt pursued his plans regardless of Olson&#x27;s disagreement. However, despite his preference for excluding Japanese Americans only from &quot;coastal California&quot;, and allowing adult men to work in labor camps as an alternative to incarceration, Olson wholeheartedly supported the eviction. A long-time supporter of nearly every Roosevelt position on economics, politics and foreign policy, on March 6, 1942, he testified before a U.S. House committee on the danger of allowing Japanese Americans to remain free: &quot;Because of the extreme difficulty in distinguishing between loyal Japanese Americans, and there are many who are loyal to this country, and those other Japanese whose loyalty is to the Mikado, I believe in the wholesale evacuation of the Japanese people from coastal California.&quot;

By the 1942 general elections, Republicans were accusing Olson of blatant partisan politics during wartime, citing Olson&#x27;s often bitter divides with the State Legislature. The Republicans nominated California Attorney General Earl Warren as the party&#x27;s nominee for the governorship. Warren, a centrist Republican, campaigned as a moderate who would appeal to both liberals and conservatives during a time of war, where California was considered as a possible front line, while accusing Olson of being an uncompromising left-wing Democrat.

Olson lost re-election to Warren in an electoral landslide, receiving just 42% of the vote to Warren&#x27;s 57%. In later years, Olson blamed &quot;the active hostility of a certain privately owned power corporation and the Roman Catholic Church in California&quot; for his defeat.

===Later career===
Following his departure from the governorship, Olson returned to law. He regained the public spotlight again in the 1950s, when the Legislature voted to exempt Catholic schools from real estate taxes. Olson filed an amicus curiae brief to the state Supreme Court, asking the court to explain how the state&#x27;s exemption of a religious organization from civil taxes was constitutional.

In 1957, Olson became president of the United Secularists of America, a body of secularists, atheists, and freethinkers.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Death ==
Olson died in Los Angeles on April 13, 1962, aged 85. He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California.

<text>Jan Ferdynand Olszewski (; 20 August 1930 – 7 February 2019) was a Polish conservative lawyer and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Poland for five months between December 1991 and early June 1992 and later became a leading figure of the conservative Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland.

During his premiership, Olszewski&#x27;s cabinet worked under new international conditions. At the end of December 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved. This motivated the government to start integration with NATO and European Community. For the first time, in official documents, it was mentioned that membership in NATO is part of Polish defence strategy. Negotiations to withdraw Russian armies from Poland started at the end of October 1990, were accelerated. In March 1992, a period of confusion occurred when president Lech Wałęsa presented his conception of new economic and military alliance with former Warsaw Pact during his visit to Germany, which went against the euro Atlantic direction of the government. Olszewski’s government changed the concept of privatization of national corporations. Total stop of privatization led to open conflict with liberal groups in the parliament. On 22 May 1992, Olszewski opposed the signing of a clause in Polish-Russian Treaty of Friendly and Neighbourly Cooperation, which handed over former Russian military bases to international Polish-Russian corporations. Olszewski sent a telegram to Moscow to the president Lech Wałęsa informing of government opposition to the clause. Wałęsa, after a conversation with Boris Yeltsin changed the controversial clause. However, this did not stop further clashes with the president.

Olszewski&#x27;s cabinet did not hold a permanent parliamentary majority. Attempts to extend the coalition, first to Democratic Union, Liberal Democratic Congress and Polish Economic Programme, and then to Confederation of Independent Poland, were unsuccessful. On 24 May 1992, the council of the Democratic Union wrote a report calling the government to resign. On 26 May, Wałęsa sent a formal note to the Marshal of the Sejm, informing of withdrawal of support for the government. On 27 May, the four parties prepared for the vote of no confidence against the government. The following day, the Sejm passed a resolution obligating the Minister of Interior (at the time Antoni Macierewicz), to publish the list of communist secret police collaborators. On 29 May, representative of the Democratic Union, Jan Rokita, presented a vote of no confidence request on the behalf of 65 members of the parliament of the three parties. On 2 June, the final day of coalition negotiations with the Confederation of Independent Poland, Macierewicz met with deputy Marshal of that party, informing him that its leader, Leszek Moczulski, was on the list of collaborators which will be presented to the Sejm the following day.

The cabinet was recalled by the Sejm in voting after the midnight of 5 June 1992, few hours after publishing the list. Olszewski supported the decision of Macierewicz, proposing to establish an independent commission to verify the validity of the published documents. The Sejm did not debate this proposal. Wałęsa pressured on the Sejm to speed up the vote of no confidence, sending his own request. On 5 June 1992, 00:00 AM, after a vote of no confidence was approved, with 273 in favour and 119 against, Olszewski was forced to resign as prime minister and his cabinet was immediately replaced in an event known as &quot;the nightshift&quot; (&quot;Nocna zmiana&quot;). After Olszewski&#x27;s dismissal, Wałęsa designated Waldemar Pawlak as the new prime minister. Olszewski&#x27;s premiership was the second shortest in the history of the Third Republic.

==Early life and World War II==
Born in Warsaw on 20 August 1930, Olszewski originated from a working-class family employed in the railway industry who were strongly connected to the Polish Socialist Party. Olszewski was related to Stefan Aleksander Okrzeja, a Polish socialist nationalist from the turn of the 20th century who was executed by Russian authorities in 1905 for leading insurgent activities. Despite Olszewski&#x27;s active preference to right-wing politics later in life, he considered himself sympathetic to socialist causes during his early formative years.

During World War II, Olszewski was active in the Szare Szeregi (Grey Ranks), an underground part of the Polish Scouting Association. According to biographical information published at footnote five, Olszewski participated in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. 

==Political career: 1954–1992==

===Communist era: 1954–1989===

In the immediate post-war years, Olszewski graduated from secondary school in 1949, later going on to study law at the University of Warsaw, where he graduated in 1953. Afterwards, he became an employee of the Ministry of Justice and later worked at the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1956, Olszewski joined the writing staff of the weekly &quot;Po prostu&quot; (&quot;Plain Speaking&quot;) magazine. As a journalist during the relatively open Polish October, Olszewski came into contact with PZPR First Secretary and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state Władysław Gomułka, whom he spent many hours interviewing and described having a trustful relationship with after many frank discussions regarding the state of affairs of Poland and the Eastern Bloc. In an article titled &quot;Na spotkanie ludziom z AK&quot; (&quot;Reaching out to the Men of the Home Army&quot;) published in March 1956, Olszewski, along with journalists Jerzy Ambroziewicz and Walery Namiotkiewicz, called for the rehabilitation of former Armia Krajowa soldiers who faced persecution from communist authorities for anti-state activities.

One of the first openly published articles of its kind to break the official silence on the Armia Krajowa, Olszewski argued that its veterans deserved a positive historical assessment in the struggle against Nazi Germany, describing all subsequent prosecutions of its ranks as being politically motivated. Despite the government&#x27;s initial toleration of &quot;Po prostu&quot;&#x27;s critiques, authorities moved in to forcibly close down the publication&#x27;s offices in October 1956, citing it of presenting a false view of political and economic realities, spreading &quot;disbeliefs&quot; about socialism and proclaiming &quot;bourgeois concepts&quot;. For his part, Olszewski faced a publication ban beginning in 1957. The forcible closure and censoring of &quot;Po prostu&quot; led Olszewski to become quickly disillusioned with the communist order. As a response, from 1956 to 1962, Olszewski was a member of the Crooked Circle Club, a Warsaw-based underground discussion group composed of intellectuals critical of the regime. During the 1960s, Olszewski became a leading defence attorney in political trials. Among others, he defended writer and journalist Melchior Wańkowicz, activist Jacek Kuroń, historian Karol Modzelewski and poet Janusz Szpotański. His professional activity was banned again in 1968 after the March student protests.

However, Olszewski returned to practice law in 1970 as Edward Gierek assumed power. Grateful for Olszewski&#x27;s legal defence at his trial, the writer Melchior Wańkowicz kept a close relationship with Olszewski for the rest of his life, bequeathing funds to the lawyer and fellow dissident Jan Józef Lipski to help future defendants of political crimes shortly before his death in 1974. Olszewski later became a signatory of the Letter of 59 in 1975, an open protest to changes to the republic&#x27;s communist constitution. In 1984, Olszewski served as an auxiliary prosecutor representing the family of murdered pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popiełuszko, whose statements during the trial of laying blame for the priest&#x27;s murder on outside influences created international headlines. Joining the Solidarity movement in the early 1980s, Olszewski quickly rose to become a major figure in the opposition movement, playing a key role in drafting its founding charter. He would go on to become one of Solidarity&#x27;s most active lawyers and legal experts. Olszewski, along with Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa and other anti-government dissidents, participated in the Round Table Talks in early 1989 with the ruling PZPR, where he served as the opposition&#x27;s legal expert. The talks successfully paved the way towards the partially free 1989 parliamentary elections.

===Post-Communist era: 1989–1991===

With the fall of the communist regime in 1989, Olszewski was appointed as a member of the State Tribunal that year, a position he would hold until 1991. In 1990, Olszewski joined the conservative Centre Agreement, whose party membership composed primarily of Wałęsa supporters in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Following the resignation of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in November 1990 after his first-round defeat in the presidential election, newly elected president Wałęsa sought a new prime minister. Initially, the president turned to Olszewski to take the position, though Olszewski quickly refused the post after numerous disagreements with Wałęsa over conditions the president placed on the prime minister&#x27;s cabinet. Instead, Wałęsa turned to Jan Krzysztof Bielecki of the Liberal Democratic Congress to form a government. Bielecki&#x27;s government lasted for the rest of 1991, collapsing in the aftermath of the inconclusive 1991 parliamentary elections.

While Wałęsa appointed Bronisław Geremek as prime minister, an accord was signed by five centrist and rightist parties in the Sejm, including the Liberal Democratic Congress, the Christian National Union, the Peasants&#x27; Agreement, the Confederation of Independent Poland and the Center Civic Alliance list (whose Olszewski&#x27;s Centre Agreement belonged to) to select the next premier. The parties supported Olszewski, a parliamentary outsider and respected lawyer from the Solidarity movement, to unite the various clubs. Grudgingly, Wałęsa, who no longer had a stable working relationship with Olszewski, honoured the coalition agreement and appointed the lawyer as premier on 6 December. Three weeks of selecting the cabinet followed. In the meantime, the original accord behind Olszewski&#x27;s appointment immediately began to fall apart, as both the Liberal Democratic Congress and the Confederation of Independent Poland withdrew their support from Olszewski over economic and cabinet disagreements. Similarly, the Democratic Union refused to support an administration not committed to rapid economic reform, a concern shared with the Liberal Democrats. Despite the weakened alliance, Olszewski&#x27;s minority government was accepted by parliament on 23 December 1991.

==Prime Minister: 1991–1992==

===Foreign and domestic policy===
Following the oath of office, Olszewski&#x27;s government faced difficulties on many fronts. Previously, Olszewski had placed deep criticism on Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz from the previous two administrations and his controversial Balcerowicz Plan, vigorously opposing the minister&#x27;s shock therapy program. Removing Balcerowicz from the cabinet, Olszewski selected Karol Lutowski, a known critic of shock therapy, as his replacement. With unemployment rising to 11.4 percent and the nation&#x27;s gross domestic product declining by ten percent over the course of one year, the Olszewski government faced pressure to amend the unpopular economic plan. Despite his professed monetarist beliefs, Olszewski pushed for a package of reforms to loosen credit, ease earlier anti-inflation policies, reintroduce price supports for a number of agricultural products, and release more subsidies to the state sector of the Polish economy.

Included in his industrial interventionist policy, the premier also proposed the unification of the nation&#x27;s economic ministries to coordinate ongoing privatizations, as well as for all industrial and trade policies. When put to a vote, however, the deeply fragmented Sejm rejected Olszewski&#x27;s reform packages, due to objections that the proposals were overly domineering or were too weak. Over the course of his government, the Sejm proved to be a barrier to any strong reforms. Olszewski explained his views on economic reforms in an interview with Anthony Murawski in the summer of 1992, published in September 1992 in Multinational Monitor magazine (founded by Ralph Nader). In particular, the prime minister&#x27;s plans to reverse the Balcerowicz Plan proved impossible due to his fragile minority government. Without majority support, Olszewski relied on the conditional support of Tadeusz Mazowiecki&#x27;s Democratic Union and Jan Krzysztof Bielecki&#x27;s Liberal Democratic Congress, yet both men and their respective parties insisted on prioritizing economic reforms. Within the government itself, the relationship between the seven parties composing the coalition was fragile at best, teetering on collapse by March 1992. Under pressure from the president to expand the coalition, Olszewski turned to the Democratic Union and the Confederation of Independent Poland, though the Union insisted on a conservative budget before it could join the cabinet.

As with the two previous administrations, the Olszewski government&#x27;s foreign policy continued to steer towards the West, with the stated desire of joining NATO. The prime minister&#x27;s selection of Jan Parys as defense minister indicated a policy hostile to Russia while Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a veteran of the previous Mazowiecki and Bielecki governments, pursued efforts of moderation and compromise, balancing relations between the West and Moscow. President Wałęsa, however, sharply disagreed with the prime minister, arguing that foreign policy efforts instead should drive towards building an alternative military alliance with fellow ex-Warsaw Pact states. Wałęsa&#x27;s proposals coincided with his own security uncertainties over the recent violent collapse of Yugoslavia, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and from a fear that joining NATO would put Poland in an opposing position to Russia. In response, Olszewski accused Skubiszewski, and by extension Wałęsa, who both advocated cooperation with Russia in regards to troop withdrawals, of &quot;Finlandizing&quot; foreign policy.

Individuals close to the Olszewski government, like Jarosław Kaczyński, referred to Wałęsa&#x27;s Belweder residence as a den of Russian interests, which was determined to &quot;maintain and protect the communist set-up&quot; and control Russian influence in Polish internal affairs. Additionally, both men stood at odds over Polish-Ukrainian relations, with Olszewski arguing that the relationship with Kyiv needed equal footing with Polish-Russian relations. At the same time, relations with the West financially soured under Olszewski&#x27;s tenureship. In the face of the premier&#x27;s attempts to stimulate the economy by proposing to raise the budget deficit, the International Monetary Fund demanded instead a restrictive budget in order to resume lending. Particularly, Western donor states pressured Olszewski to replace Lutowski as finance minister. When Olszewski reshuffled ministers, placing Andrzej Olechowski at the Ministry of Finance, observers believed that the premier had reverted to a hard-line economic reform posture. Yet when the Sejm passed a bill authorizing salary and pension increases, raising the budget deficit by fifty percent, Olechowski fiercely objected and resigned from the cabinet, claiming he did not have &quot;the slightest idea&quot; of how to explain the government&#x27;s economic reasoning to the IMF.

===De-communization and the Parys affair===
The conflict between Olszewski and Wałęsa continued to escalate throughout 1992, culminating in a major political crisis by that summer. As premier, Olszewski portrayed himself and his government as staunchly anti-communist, arguing that in the year 1992, Poland continued to remain a communist country. Claiming that communist agents remained in all corridors of economic and political power, Olszewski argued for a purge, particularly of those in the economic sector, whom Olszewski believed were holding back Poland&#x27;s new capitalist free market and kept workers bound. &quot;The invisible hand [of the market]&quot;, Olszewski said, was &quot;simply the hand of the swindler plundering funds from the state treasury&quot;. As such, Olszewski argued for increased democratization and de-communinization at all levels of Polish society. Olszewski&#x27;s drive towards de-communization was also reflected in his cabinet. Jan Parys, Olszewski&#x27;s defense minister, actively pursued efforts to de-communize the Polish Armed Forces and establish civilian ministerial control. These plans ran in conjunction with Wałęsa&#x27;s efforts to stake executive control over the defense establishment. Parys and Wałęsa repeatedly clashed over plans to reorganize national security commands, with Parys effectively challenging Wałęsa&#x27;s role as commander in chief by claiming ministerial rights over the armed forces.

The clash between both men came to a head in April 1992, when, upon learning of a meeting between National Security Bureau Director Jerzy Milewski, a close Wałęsa ally, with Polish Army General Tadeusz Wilecki, promising the general&#x27;s promotion to the high command, Parys accused the presidency of interfering with the defense ministry&#x27;s portfolio. Parys stated that &quot;certain politicians&quot; promised promotions to army officers in exchange &quot;for a kind of army support for political maneuvers&quot;. Parys further elaborated that &quot;politicians who undertake such moves behind my back are simply involved in intrigue&quot;, believing that &quot;they are working to the detriment of the army and Poland; they simply are political schemers. To put it briefly: the Polish Army will help no one striving to abolish democracy in Poland&quot;. Parys&#x27;s implication of a possible coup d&#x27;etat on the behalf of Wałęsa and his allies with bribed high-ranking military officials rocked the entire Polish political establishment. To quiet the political storm, Olszewski responded by placing Parys on administrative leave. In response, a parliamentary commission was quickly created in the Sejm to investigate Parys&#x27;s claims. The commission&#x27;s findings cleared Wałęsa of wrongdoing and declared Parys&#x27;s claims as baseless and &quot;unfounded&quot;, forcing the defense minister to resign. In the aftermath of the Parys affair, Wałęsa bitterly complained of the Olszewski government&#x27;s handling of the controversy, declaring the government&#x27;s civilian leaders of endangering both national security and the professionalism of the military. The relationship between Olszewski and Wałęsa further soured with Olszewski&#x27;s appointment of Radosław Sikorski as deputy defense minister without presidential consultation, a move interpreted as the premier vying for influence within the armed forces.

===Clashes with Wałęsa===
The deepening chasm between both men began to interrupt foreign policy. As both men sought to assert control over the economy, the military, and international relations, particularly over-sensitive negotiations to withdraw Russian Army units from the country, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski admitted that by May 1992, &quot;[i]t was difficult to conduct the foreign policy of an internally unstable country&quot;. The overlying reason for the clash between both men emanated from the fact that both the prime minister and the president believed their respective offices carried the prerogative to direct government policy, particularly in the defence, interior, and foreign ministries. As premier, Olszewski believed that his position, along with the collective Council of Ministers, held precedence in conducting the affairs of state. On the other side, President Wałęsa believed that as the chief executive and head of state he was ultimately responsible for the direction of the republic&#x27;s affairs. The clash between both offices created a highly charged and disruptive political environment. Despite this instability, Skubiszewski continued to negotiate with his Russian counterparts on financial and business settlements in regards to the pullout of Russian Army units from the country. Skubiszewski&#x27;s diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise with his Russian colleagues were met with vehement criticism from Olszewski, with many close to the premier believing that any monetary or trade settlements constituted a renewed occupation. Despite the premier&#x27;s strong objections to the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s negotiations with their Russian counterparts, President Wałęsa strongly supported such moves for a final agreement. Meetings between Olszewski and Wałęsa in May 1992 displayed the divide between both men, with the premier insisting on removing any article on joint Polish-Russian financial and business deals from the treaty while Wałęsa responded that he intended to visit Russia not &quot;to negotiate any agreement, but to sign it&quot;.

===Dismissal===
By late May, Olszewski&#x27;s fragile coalition faced collapse. Shortly after returning from Moscow from signing the cooperation treaty on 26 May 1992, Wałęsa formally asked the Sejm to withdraw its support from Olszewski&#x27;s premiership, stating he had no faith in the government. The president cited the government&#x27;s &quot;irresponsible steps in foreign affairs&quot; as part of his decision. Two days later on 28 May, with half of parliament&#x27;s members absent, Sejm member Janusz Korwin-Mikke of the small conservative-libertarian Real Politics Union successfully pressed for and passed a motion requiring the Ministry of Interior to identify all of the republic&#x27;s leading politicians who collaborated previously in the communist secret services. Despite the resolution, opposition parties, including the Democratic Union, the Liberal Democratic Congress and the Polish Economic Program (a split faction of the Polish Beer-Lovers&#x27; Party), moved to file a vote of no confidence. Responding to the lustration resolution six days later on 4 June, Interior Minister Antoni Macierewicz released to all parliamentary faction heads a secret list of 64 names of communist-era collaborators drawn from his ministry&#x27;s archives. 

Known as the Macierewicz List, which was quickly leaked to the public, the roster included Wiesław Chrzanowski, the Marshal of the Sejm and a member of Olszewski&#x27;s coalition as well as Leszek Moczulski, the head of the opposition Confederation of Independent Poland. A second list published shortly afterwards included President Wałęsa himself. In response, Wałęsa immediately demanded for the government&#x27;s dismissal, yet in private, the president confessed to opposition legislators his worries that Olszewski was orchestrating a last minute coup against him. Late on the night of 4 June, on the eve of his vote of confidence, Olszewski made an unplanned televised address on public broadcasters TVP1 and 2, defending his administration&#x27;s lustration list and appealing for the public to rally behind the government: My government was the first to want to reveal old, secret relationships of individuals who recently volunteered to enter into the state&#x27;s new administration. I believe that the Polish people should know those who govern them, including those who helped the UB and SB to keep Poles enslaved. I believe the collaborators of the former communist political police constitute a threat to the security of the free Polish people. The people should know that not coincidentally, just at the moment when we can finally break away from communist ties, there is a sudden move for the government&#x27;s dismissal.

In the early hours after midnight on 5 June, in an event known as the &quot;nocna zmiana&quot; (&quot;the nightshift&quot;), the Sejm convened for a vote of no confidence. Despite Olszewski&#x27;s public appeals both on television and within the debating chamber, parliament&#x27;s majority opinion became readily apparent of supporting his dismissal. Aside from the opposition post-communist Democratic Left Alliance, members of the Tadeusz Mazowiecki-oriented Democratic Union, the Liberal Democrats, and other centrist and liberal parties remained unfazed with their loss of confidence with the prime minister. The opposition was joined from the right by the Confederation of Independent Poland, whose members derided the Olszewski government&#x27;s attempt at radical lustration just before a vote of confidence as outright blackmail. Facing certain defeat, an emotional Olszewski addressed the Sejm, stating:&quot;I would like to get out of this place with just one achievement. And as of this moment, I have the belief that I will go out with it. I would like to say when this period finishes when time runs out for me—I admit—a terribly painful time, when in my hometown&#x27;s streets, I can only move about by car or in the company of guards protecting me from human contact—when my time does finally finish—I can take to the streets of my city freely again, to move about and look people in the eye. And that for you, honourable members is what I wish for after this vote.&quot;
The vote of no confidence was approved, with 273 in favour and 119 against. Olszewski was immediately replaced by Wałęsa ally Waldemar Pawlak of the Polish People&#x27;s Party. Pawlak&#x27;s government failed to gain support from Sejm majority and failed in a vote of confidence. Pawlak later resigned and Wałęsa replaced him by Hanna Suchocka, who won support from the majority. Two weeks following the government&#x27;s no-confidence vote, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled 11–1 the Sejm&#x27;s 28 May lustration resolution singling out alleged communist collaborators as illegal due to it not being a statutory enactment, as well as violating both the dignity of citizens and democratic values. The list produced by former Interior Minister Macierewicz was similarly found to be filled with inaccuracies, forcing the ministry to later apologize to several of those falsely implicated.

==Post-Premiership==

===Parliamentary career: 1992–2005===


Following his dismissal, Olszewski resumed his career as a member of the Sejm. Olszewski departed from the Centre Agreement in the summer of 1992 with a number of other rebel MPs, creating the Movement for the Republic. The new party was joined by other anti-Wałęsa and former Solidarity supporters, carrying a quasi-nationalist and ultra-Catholic platform. As a parliamentarian, Olszewski led his club&#x27;s opposition to the Small Constitution, believing it did not offer a clear break from the Stalinist constitution of 1956. Olszewski led his party to support the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka in 1993, believing her economic policies had harmed the state. In the subsequent elections that year, Olszewski lost his seat as the electorate swung to the Democratic Left Alliance (led by Aleksander Kwaśniewski), despite a failed attempt to reunite rightist forces with the Centre Agreement, now headed by Jarosław Kaczyński.

In 1995, Olszewski launched a bid for the presidency in that year&#x27;s presidential election in order to replace his rival Wałęsa. Campaigning on an anti-communist and patriotic platform, Olszewski garnered 1,225,453 votes, with nearly seven percent of the vote and earned fourth place. However, both he and Wałęsa lost to winning left-wing candidate Aleksander Kwaśniewski from Social Democracy. Later in the same year, in an attempt to consolidate the former premier&#x27;s relatively strong performance in the presidential ballot, Olszewski and his supporters established the Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland.

Under the new party banner, poll numbers initially gave Olszewski&#x27;s block a sixteen percent approval rating by the middle of 1996, yet this period was cut short with the creation of Solidarity Electoral Action, a rival conservative alliance led by Marian Krzaklewski. The results of the 1997 parliamentary election garnered Olszewski&#x27;s party with 5.6 percent of the vote, returning the former premier to the Sejm with six seats. During this period, Olszewski supported Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s 1997 concordant with the Holy See, reasoning that the Catholic Church was &quot;one of the most important, if not the most important, and certainly the most durable, longest-running and most rooted institution in Polish national life and culture&quot;. At the same time, Olszewski also generally supported European integration and the government&#x27;s efforts for Poland&#x27;s accession into the European Union, though stressed reservations on the economic conditions of integration, particularly insisting that the national banking sector must remain within domestic hands. However, the Movement became increasingly marginalized due to numerous party splits.

During the 2000 presidential election, Olszewski stood again as a candidate, but withdrew from the race shortly before the vote and later supported the Solidarity Electoral Action candidate Marian Krzaklewski. Olszewski was reelected to the Sejm in 2001, with his party allied with the populist far-right League of Polish Families. However, Olszewski broke with the League shortly after his reelection over policy differences. Prior to Poland&#x27;s admission into the EU in 2004, Olszewski expressed worry that Poland&#x27;s accession to the European Union would pave the way for Germans to make property claims regarding land seized during the population expulsions at the end of World War II. The former premier also expressed in 2005 his support for strong security and political relations with the United States within a transatlantic framework, though expressed reservations to stronger ties with Germany until property claims were dealt with.

In 2005, Olszewski, along with his former cabinet ministers Antoni Macierewicz and Gabriel Janowski, created the Patriotic Movement, a right-wing nationalist political block combining the forces of his own party with those of the National-Catholic Movement and the Polish Alliance, where he became the head of the new organization. In that year&#x27;s parliamentary election, Olszewski ran for a Senate seat in the Warsaw constituency for the Law and Justice list, but was defeated, coming sixth. Following his exit from parliament after his failed Senat bid, Olszewski was appointed as deputy chairman of the State Tribunal between 2005 and 2006. President Lech Kaczyński later appointed Olszewski as a presidential adviser in April 2006, a position he held until Kaczyński&#x27;s death in the 2010 Smolensk air disaster.

==Personal life and death==
Olszewski was married to Marta Olszewska, a former activist, editor and journalist of &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot;. On the night of 16 August 2000, Olszewski was involved in a deadly car crash on national road 8 near the village of Marków-Towarzystwo in Masovian Voivodeship, when the car Olszewski was a passenger in collided with a truck. The driver of the car (Olszewski&#x27;s party treasurer) was killed in the crash, while Olszewski escaped with only minor injuries. In July 2014, Olszewski was made an honorary citizen of Warsaw by Mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz for his participation in the Warsaw Uprising as well as citing his moral and social authority in service of the city. Olszewski died after a long illness on 7 February 2019 in a Warsaw hospital.

===Legacy===
Olszewski remains a controversial figure within Polish politics. Members of the right-wing, particularly Law and Justice leader Jarosław Kaczyński, have praised the former premier for his anti-communist stances and legal principles. On the twentieth anniversary of the Olszewski government&#x27;s vote of no confidence in 2012, Kaczyński praised Olszewski for attempting to stop the rapid privatizations of the early 1990s, and having helped steer Poland towards its eventual integration into NATO. 

Former Interior Minister Antoni Macierewicz also affirmed his personal belief in 2012 that had the Olszewski government not fallen, &quot;the Smolensk disaster would never have transpired&quot;.

Politicians on the centre-right have viewed Olszewski more critically. Christian National Union politician Stefan Niesiołowski strongly defended Olszewski during his vote of no confidence in 1992, declaring to the premier&#x27;s detractors that &quot;you&#x27;re making a political mistake and Poland won&#x27;t forget this error&quot;. In an interview in 2007, Niesiołowski (now a Civic Platform parliamentarian) regretted his defense of the former prime minister in hindsight, describing Olszewski as &quot;being a poor man who supported a moral lie&quot; with the Macierewicz List, &quot;and was still silent&quot;. 

Prime Minister Donald Tusk similarly accused Olszewski of misleading information in 2008 during a non-governmental investigation into communist era archives conducted by the former premier, declaring: &quot;I know that in Poland there are politicians who have genuinely strange archives and cannot get used to the idea that they&#x27;re no longer prime ministers or heads of committees anymore, spending instead a lifetime in these archives, poisoning our public space with their own interpretations of what they have found&quot;. 

In an opinion poll conducted by CBOS in 2014, asking respondents to evaluate who was the best prime minister of the Third Republic, Olszewski was placed at seventh place. A similar poll conducted by Millward Brown later that year positioned Olszewski at sixth place.

<doc id="758830" wikidata="Q6750875" url="?curid=758830" title="Manning O'Brine">
<text>Paddy Manning O&#x27;Brine was an Irish writer of thrillers and television screenplays about whom surprisingly little is known. His date of birth is uncertain: at least one authoritative source gives it as 1915; the dust jacket of his last American publication, however, says that he was born in Connemara, Ireland, in 1913 with dual Irish and Italian citizenship. Internet booksellers frequently give his date of death as 1977. All of his novels concern espionage and/or secret agents and often feature sadistic Nazis who have survived World War II and are hunted down and killed.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; review of &quot;No Earth for Foxes&quot; closes with these lines: &quot;The jacket copy has a sentence about O&#x27;Brine that is a real stopper. &#x27;He killed his first Nazi in Heidelberg in 1937 and his last one in Madagascar in 1950.&#x27; Try to top that one.&quot;

The backcover blurb for the 1976 American paperback edition says in addition that O&#x27;Brine was a former British secret agent.During World War II, he was parachuted into Occupied France, was captured by the Gestapo, escaped from a train taking him to Buchenwald, and served in Algeria, Yugoslavia and Italy. He has been awarded medals from many nations. 

The dust jacket of &quot;Pale Moon Rising&quot; is somewhat more restrained in its biographical details, although certainly testifying to an unusually varied, and perilous, life: 
He studied art and architecture at Rome University and became a scenic designer. He was a Commando during the War, carrying out many missions in France, North Africa and Yugoslavia. He then fought in Palestine with the Israelis against Glubb Pasha and the Arab Legion, and subsequently arrived in Cairo where he took on the job of managing a stranded Opera company. He returned to Italy and, whilst working in Rome Film Studios, wrote the story for Fellini&#x27;s first film &quot;Rome:Open City&quot;. Manning O&#x27;Brine lived in Sussex with his wife and four sons.

Manning O&#x27;Brine is not credited on &quot;Rome:Open City&quot;. Screenplay credits are by Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini from a story by Sergio Amidei. Roberto Rossellini was the director.

O&#x27;Brine began with a series of seven books about Michael the O&#x27;Kelly that were somewhat light-hearted in tone. He then wrote four novels that were grimmer and more realistic in nature and for which he received a certain amount of critical praise. These books are: &quot;Crambo&quot;, &quot;Mills&quot;, &quot;No Earth for Foxes&quot;, and &quot;Pale Moon Rising&quot;, the latter being set in wartime France. A number of common characters appear throughout these books, such as Pavane and Crambo, but the most important one is generally Mills, who is obsessed, as apparently O&#x27;Brine himself was, with tracking down and killing Nazi war criminals.

His last novel, &quot;Pale Moon Rising&quot;, is apparently based on his own experiences as a 30-year-old in wartime France. Of it, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[it] is well-written and is an exciting adventure story. But transcending all is Mr. O&#x27;Brine&#x27;s loathing for Nazi Germany, the &quot;ubermenschen&quot; and all they represented. He uses his book as a not very subtle tract to condemn the system.&quot;

He also wrote the screenplays for films including &quot;Man from Tangier&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Long Shadow&quot; (1961) and episodes of television series including &quot;No Hiding Place&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;.

His novel &quot;Passport to Treason&quot; was filmed in 1956 by producer-director Robert S. Baker, starring Rod Cameron.

In a bitterly worded and ironic forward to &quot;No Earth for Foxes&quot; called &quot;A Note from the Author&quot;, O&#x27;Brine writes in 1973 or 1974 that: ...it remains a nightmare reality that, in 1965, ex-Nazis held 21 ministerial and state secretarial appointments in West Germany alone; 128 were generals of the Bundeswehr; 828 were high judges, court counselors, public prosecutors; 245 were with embassies and consulates of the Bonn Foreign Service; 297 were in key positions in the police and secret services... If facts are interpreted by some as prejudice, then I stand a prejudiced man; if knowledge can be termed bigotry, I am truly a bigot.&quot; 

Of Mills, the hero of the eponymously named 1969 novel, a man &quot;who came out of World War II with a blinding obsession: the eradication of Nazi butchers,&quot; the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;You won&#x27;t always like Mills, you&#x27;ll find his story drags a bit in spots, but you&#x27;ll discover both subtly compelling all the same.&quot;

<text>The Legislative Assembly () was the legislature of the Kingdom of France from 1 October 1791 to 20 September 1792 during the years of the French Revolution. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention. Legislative Assembly saw an unprecedented turnover of four ministers of Justice, four ministers of Navy, six ministers of the interior, seven ministers of foreign affairs, and eight ministers of war. 

== History ==
=== Background ===
The National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 30 September 1791. Upon Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s motion, it decreed that none of its members would be eligible for the next legislature. Its successor body, the Legislative Assembly, operating over the liberal French Constitution of 1791, lasted until 20 September 1792 when the National Convention was established after the insurrection of 10 August just the month before.

The Legislative Assembly entrenched the perceived left–right political spectrum that is still commonly used today. There were 745 members.

== Elections ==
The elections of 1791, held by census suffrage, brought in a legislature that desired to carry the Revolution further.
The rightists within the assembly consisted of 264 Feuillants, whose chief leaders, Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette and Antoine Barnave, remained outside the House because of their ineligibility for re-election. They were staunch constitutional monarchists, firm in their defence of the king against the popular agitation.

The leftists were of 136 Jacobins (still including the party later known as the Girondins or Girondists) and Cordeliers. Its most famous leaders were Jacques Pierre Brissot, the philosopher Condorcet and Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud. The Left drew its inspiration from the more radical tendency of the Enlightenment, regarded the émigré nobles as traitors and espoused anticlericalism. They were suspicious of Louis XVI, some of them favoring a general European war, both to spread the new ideals of liberty and equality and to put the king&#x27;s loyalty to the test.

The remainder of the House, 345 deputies, generally belonged to no definite party. They were called The Marsh (&quot;Le Marais&quot;) or The Plain (&quot;La Plaine&quot;). They were committed to the ideals of the Revolution, hence generally inclined to side with the Left, but would also occasionally back proposals from the Right.

The king&#x27;s ministers, named by him and excluded from the Assembly, are described by the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;mostly persons of little mark&quot;.

== Formation ==

The 27 August 1791 Declaration of Pillnitz already threatened France with an attack by its neighbors. King Louis XVI favored war hoping to exploit a military defeat to restore his absolute power—the Assembly was leaning toward war and to spread the ideals of the Revolution. This led in April 1792 to the first of the French Revolutionary Wars.

The king vetoed many of the Assembly&#x27;s bills throughout its existence such as these:
* Legislation declaring the &quot;émigrés&quot; guilty of conspiracy and prosecuted as such was passed on 8 November 1791, but vetoed by Louis.
* Enforcement of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy: on 29 November 1791, the Assembly decreed that every nonjuring clergyman who did not take the civic oath within eight days would lose his pension and—if any troubles broke out—he would be deported. Louis vetoed the decree as a matter of conscience.

Louis XVI formed a series of cabinets, veering at times as far left as the Girondins. However, by the summer of 1792, amid war and insurrection, it had become clear that the monarchy and the now-dominant Jacobins could not reach any accommodation. On 11 July 1792, the Assembly formally declared the nation in danger because of the dire military situation.

On 9 August 1792, a new revolutionary Commune took possession of Hôtel de Ville and early on the morning of 10 August the insurgents assailed the Tuileries, where the royal family resided. Louis and his family sought asylum with the Legislative Assembly.

The Assembly stripped Louis, suspected of intelligence with the enemy, of all his royal functions and prerogatives. The king and his family were subsequently imprisoned in the Temple. On 10 August 1792, a resolution was adopted to summon a new National Convention, to be elected by universal suffrage.

Many who had sat in the National Constituent Assembly and many more who had sat in the Legislative Assembly were re-elected. The Convention met on 20 September 1792 and became the new government of France.

== Reforms ==
There were numerous reforms passed by the Legislative Assembly that addressed various topics including divorce, émigrés, and the clergy.

The Legislative Assembly implemented new reforms to help create a society of independent individuals with equal rights. These reforms included new legislation about divorce, government control over registration, and inheritance rights for children. The registration of births, marriages, and deaths became a function under the government instead of the Catholic Church. The new laws introduced adoption and gave illegitimate children inheritance rights equal to those of legitimate children. Before 1791, divorces could only be granted for adultery and other violations of the marriage contract, but under the new reform a couple could also get divorced if they met one or more of the following:
* If there was mutual consent of both spouses
* If there was a unilateral incompatibility of character
* If the couple had been formally separated before and needed a legalized divorce
* If there was dissolution of marriage due to &quot;insanity, condemnation to an infamous punishment, violence or ill-treatment, notoriously dissolute morals, desertion for at least two years, absence without news for at least five years, and emigration&quot;
The new divorce laws were not sexually discriminatory as both the man and woman had the right to file for a divorce—the women petitioned for the most divorce decrees.

The émigrés, mainly members of the nobility and public office who fled France after the events of the Revolution turned violent, were a major focus of the Legislative Assembly. In their decree on 9 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly established a three-class hierarchy of émigrés as well as the punishments that would correspond with each class. The first class was composed of the princes and other people of high birth who &quot;formed [emigration’s] rallying point and controlled both its recruiting in France and its organization abroad&quot;.

The second class was composed of officials in public office, soldiers and other members of society with less organizational clout than members of the nobility yet more influence than the common people. The third and final class of recognized émigrés encompassed the average French citizens who left France yet commanded little to no direct influence over emigration proceedings.

In twelve articles, the decree outlined the economic and political punishments of the first and second classes—particularly assigning deadlines by which time emigration would be classified as an act of treason. Article 3 dictated that first class émigrés still abroad after 1 January would be &quot;impeached for treason and punished with death&quot; and articles 6 through 10 imposed a loss of position, salary, and even citizenship for second class émigrés still abroad after 14 September. Along with the declaration that emigration could result in the loss of active citizenship, article 6 established the Assembly&#x27;s right to sequester first class émigrés&#x27; revenues and article 11 classified émigré soldiers as deserters.

As the Legislative Assembly considered third class émigrés to be faultless victims of trickery and seduction by the other two classes, the legislators&#x27; decree explicitly avoided issuing punitive measures against third class émigrés—whereas the other classes were to be financially and socially punished, third class émigrés were to be treated with &quot;sympathy and understanding&quot;. The émigrés decree was vetoed by the king three days later.

The laws regarding the clergy were mostly made in response to a reform passed by the National Assembly in July 1790, known as the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. In this decree, the National Assembly took the power to appoint bishops and curés away from the king. Many members of the Catholic clergy objected to this ruling. In response, the National Assembly required a public oath of fidelity from the clergy if they wanted to retain their positions in the Catholic Church.

This decision was not well received by a substantial portion of the clergy, which is why the Legislative Assembly felt it was necessary to address the issue. Those unwilling to take the oath were known as non-juring members. On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly decreed that any who refused to take the oath were committing a political crime and were liable to punishments including loss of pension and expulsion from their homes in the event of religious disturbances.

== Political groups ==
The Legislative Assembly was driven by two opposing groups. The members of the first group were conservative members of the bourgeoisie (wealthy middle class in the Third Estate) that favored a constitutional monarchy, represented by the Feuillants, who felt that the revolution had already achieved its goal. The other group was the democratic faction, for whom the king could no longer be trusted, represented by the new members of the Jacobin Club that claimed that more revolutionary measures were necessary.

<text>The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language.

In English, the word &quot;past&quot; was one of the many variant forms and spellings of &quot;passed&quot;, the past participle of the Middle English verb (whence Modern English &quot;pass&quot;), among &quot;ypassed&quot;, &quot;ypassyd&quot;, &quot;i-passed&quot;, &quot;passyd&quot;, &quot;passid&quot;, &quot;pass&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;paste&quot;, etc. It developed into an adjective and preposition in the 14th century, and a noun (as in &quot;the past&quot; or &quot;a past&quot;, through ellipsis with the adjective &quot;past&quot;) in the 15th century.

== Grammar ==
In English grammar, actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past (past, uses of English verb forms, past perfect, or past perfect continuous), present (present, present continuous, present perfect, or present perfect continuous), or future (future, future continuous, future perfect, or future perfect continuous). The past tense refers to actions that have already happened. For example, &quot;she is walking&quot; refers to a girl who is currently walking (present tense), while &quot;she walked&quot; refers to a girl who was walking before now (past tense).

The past continuous tense refers to actions that continued for a period of time, as in the sentence &quot;she was walking,&quot; which describes an action that was still happening in a prior window of time to which a speaker is presently referring. The past perfect tense is used to describe actions that were already completed by a specific point in the past. For example, &quot;she had walked&quot; describes an action that took place in the past and was also completed in the past.

The past perfects continuous tense refers to an action that was happening up until a particular point in the past but was completed. It is different from the past perfect tense because the emphasis of past perfect continuous verbs is not on the action having been completed by the present moment, but rather on its having taken place actively over a time period before another moment in the past. The verb tense used in the sentence &quot;She had been walking in the park regularly before I met her&quot; is past perfect continuous because it describes an action (&quot;walking&quot;) that was actively happening before a time when something else in the past was happening (when &quot;I met her&quot;).

Depending on its usage in a sentence, &quot;past&quot; can be described using a variety of terms. Synonyms for &quot;past&quot; as an adjective include, &quot;former,&quot; &quot;bygone,&quot; &quot;earlier,&quot; &quot;preceding,&quot; and &quot;previous.&quot; Synonyms for &quot;past&quot; as a noun include, &quot;history, &quot;background,&quot; &quot;life story,&quot; and &quot;biography.&quot; Synonyms of &quot;past&quot; as a preposition include, &quot;in front of,&quot; &quot;beyond,&quot; &quot;by,&quot; and &quot;in excess of.&quot;

== Other uses ==
The word &quot;past&quot; can also be used to describe the offices of those who have previously served in an organization, group, or event such as, &quot;past president,&quot; or, &quot;past champions.&quot; &quot;Past&quot; can also refer to something or someone being at or in a position that is further than a particular point. For instance, in the sentence, &quot;I live on Fielding Road, just past the train station,&quot; the word &quot;past&quot; is used to describe a location (the speaker&#x27;s residence) beyond a certain point (the train station). Alternatively, the sentence, &quot;He ran past us at full speed,&quot; utilizes the concept of the past to describe the position of someone (&quot;He&quot;) that is further than the speaker.

The &quot;past&quot; is also used to define a time that is a certain number of minute before or after a particular hour, as in &quot;We left the party at half-past twelve.&quot; People also use &quot;past&quot; to refer to being beyond a particular biological age or phase of being, as in, &quot;The boy was past the age of needing a babysitter,&quot; or, &quot;I&#x27;m past caring about that problem.&quot; The &quot;past&quot; is commonly used to refer to history, either generally or with regards to specific time periods or events, as in, &quot;Past monarchs had absolute power to determine the law in contrast to many European Kings and Queens of today.&quot;

Nineteenth-century British author Charles Dickens created one of the best-known fictional personifications of the &quot;past&quot; in his short book, &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; In the story, the Ghost of Christmas Past is an apparition that shows the main character, a cold-hearted and tight-fisted man named Ebenezer Scrooge, vignettes from his childhood and early adult life to teach him that joy does not necessarily come from wealth.

== Fields of study ==
The past is the object of study within such fields as time, life, history, nostalgia, archaeology, archaeoastronomy, chronology, geology, historical geology, historical linguistics, ontology, paleontology, paleobotany, paleoethnobotany, palaeogeography, paleoclimatology, etymology and physical cosmology.

<doc id="758860" wikidata="Q4412856" url="?curid=758860" title="Asgardians (Marvel Comics)">
<text>The Asgardians or Gods of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] are a fictional humanoid race of gods appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Some are taken from mythology while others are original creations.

==Fictional history==
They were worshipped about a millennium ago by the Norsemen of Scandinavia and various Germanic tribes, but they no longer have, or seek to have, any worshippers on Earth.

The gods live in a dimension called Asgard which is also home to five other races (Giants, Dwarves, Elves, Trolls, and Demons).

==Known members==
Known Æsir include Amora the Enchantress, Balder, Bor, Búri, Brunnhilde, Fandral, Frigga, Heimdall, Hermod, Hildegarde, Hoder, Kelda, Lorelei, Magni, Mimir, Odin, Sif, Skurge the Executioner, Thor, Tyr, Vidar, Vili, Ve, Volla, and Volstagg. Known Vanir include Frey, Freya, Idunn, Njord, and Sigyn.

==Powers and abilities==
Despite their mostly human appearance, all Asgardians possess physical attributes that operate on superhuman levels. All Asgardians possess some degree of superhuman strength, with males typically being stronger than females.

The Asgardians are extremely long lived and age at an extremely slow pace as compared to human beings, unlike the Olympians who cease to age once reaching adulthood. The bodies of the Asgardians possess some degree of superhuman durability. If an Asgardian is injured, he or she will be able to recover much faster than humans. However, they sometimes require magical aids in order to heal themselves from severe injuries, such as missing limbs, organs, and severe blood loss. Often, even with the help of magic, regenerating limbs or organs is beyond their capacity. Only the most physically or mystically gifted Asgardians have the potential to heal from such severe injuries.

The muscle, bone, and skin tissue of an Asgardian is considerably denser than that of a human being. This contributes to the Asgardians superior strength and weight. Due to their superior metabolism, Asgardians also possess superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities.

All Asgardians are born with the potential to wield and control mystical energies for a variety of purposes, although only a certain few have been observed to have developed this ability to any noticeable degree.

Asgardians are not true immortals. They do age, albeit slowly, but are immune to all known Earthly diseases. Each Asgardian needs, and is allocated, a golden apple grown by Yggdrasil and tended by Idunn. Eating their own apple is essential for an Asgardian to maintain his or her physical vitality.

If an Asgardian dies, his or her place in a type of afterlife is determined by the circumstances of their death. If an Asgardian has died in battle, the Valkyrior will take his or her soul to Valhalla, Odin&#x27;s palace, where they shall spend eternity feasting and fighting. The souls of Asgardians that haven&#x27;t died in battle are taken to the realm of Hela, the Asgardian Goddess of Death.

There has been some contradiction regarding the origin of the Asgardians. Main Marvel canon states that the Asgardians are descendants of the Elder Gods, as are all other pantheons on Earth.

==Reception==
* In 2022, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Asgardians 2nd in their &quot;The Avengers&#x27; 10 Best Allies In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

==Other versions==
Some comics set in alternate universes have claimed that they are not Gods. Rather, they are aliens whose science and abilities are advanced so far beyond the science and abilities of humans that the Asgardians appear to be magic, such as in &quot;Earth X&quot; where the Asgardians turned out to be the final evolution of manipulation by the Celestials.

==Other media==
Asgardians have appeared in films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Thor appearing in several films in the series. Tom Hiddleston portrays Loki in the films &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot; and the two-part &quot;&quot;.

The 2011 film &quot;Thor&quot; and the 2013 film &quot;&quot; featured many unnamed Asgardians. Those films and other films in the series have featured Odin, Sif, Frigga, Heimdall, Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun.

It was described from fossils found in a Maevarano Formation quarry near the village of Berivotra, Mahajanga Province, Madagascar. The age of the fossilised specimen is Late Cretaceous, probably Maastrichtian (72.1-66.0 mya). &quot;V. berivotrensis&quot; is known from scattered remains, possibly from a single individual (UA 8651 and FMNH PA715).

The phylogenic affinity of &quot;Vorona&quot; is hard to determine due to the fragmentary nature of the remains, mainly because the fossil shows a mix of basal avian features as well as some that seem very derived. &quot;Vorona&quot; might be a primitive ornithuromorph. At least two studies recovered it as part of Enantiornithes, however.

&quot;Vorona&quot; is sometimes confused with the dromaeosaur &quot;Rahonavis ostromi&quot;, a fossil of which was found in the same location. This confusion has led to the common misconception that &quot;Vorona&quot; had a deinonychosaur-like sickle claw on each foot.

<text>Sylvanus Épiphanio Olympio (; 6 September 1902 – 13 January 1963) was a Togolese politician who served as prime minister, and then president, of Togo from 1958 until his assassination in 1963. He came from the important Olympio family, which included his uncle Octaviano Olympio, one of the richest people in Togo in the early 1900s.

After graduating from the London School of Economics, he worked for Unilever and became the general manager of the African operations of that company. After World War II, Olympio became prominent in efforts for independence of Togo and his party won the 1958 election, making him the prime minister of the country. His power was further cemented when Togo achieved independence and he won the 1961 election, making him the first president of Togo. He was assassinated during the 1963 Togolese coup d&#x27;état.

== Early life and business career ==
Sylvanus Olympio was born on 6 September 1902 in Kpandu in the German protectorate of Togoland, present day Volta Region of Ghana. He was the grandson to the important Brazilian trader Francisco Olympio Sylvio and son to Ephiphanio Olympio, who ran the prominent trading house for the Miller Brothers from Liverpool in Agoué (in present-day Benin). His uncle, Octaviano Olympio, had located his business in Lomé, which would become the capital of the protectorate, and quickly became one of the richest people in the German and then French colony of Togoland. The Olympios therefore belonged to an aristocratic community of mixed Brazilian and other African descent that was related to both the Tabom people of Ghana and the Amaro people of Nigeria.

His early education was at the German Catholic school in Lomé, which his uncle Octaviano had built for the Society for the Divine Word. Following that, he began study at the London School of Economics, where he studied economics under Harold Laski. Upon graduation, he worked for Unilever first in Nigeria and then in the Gold Coast. By 1929, he was located to be the head of Unilever operations in Togoland. 

In 1938, he remained in Lomé, but was promoted to become the general manager of the United Africa Company&#x27;s, then part of Unilever, operations throughout Africa. During this time he married Dina Grunitzky, a woman of mixed Ghanaian and German Polish heritage. She was born in Keta (Ghana) as a member of the Amegashie royal family. They had five children together: Bonito, Rosita, Gilchrist, Sylvana and Elpidio.

During World War II, the colony came under the control of the Vichy France government which treated the Olympio family with general suspicion because of their ties to the British. Olympio was arrested in 1942 and held under constant surveillance in the remote city of Djougou in French Dahomey. The imprisonment would permanently change his view toward the French and he would become active in pushing for independence of Togo at the end of the war.

== Political career ==
Olympio became active in the domestic and international struggle to gain independence for Togo following World War II. Since Togo was not formally a French colony, but was a trustee under the rules of the League of Nations and then the United Nations, Olympio petitioned the United Nations Trusteeship Council for a host of issues pushing toward independence. His 1947 petition to the Trusteeship Council was the first petition for resolution of grievances taken to the United Nations. Domestically he founded the &quot;Comité de l&#x27;unité togolaise&quot; (CUT) which became the major party opposing French control over Togo.

Olympio&#x27;s party boycotted most of the elections during the 1950s within Togo because of the heavy French involvement in the elections (including the 1956 election that made Nicolas Grunitzky, the brother to Olympio&#x27;s wife, the Prime Minister of the colony as head of the Togolese Progress Party). In 1954, Olympio was arrested by the French authorities and his right to vote and run for office were suspended. However, his petitions to the Trusteeship Council led to the 1958 elections where French control over the elections were limited, although involvement remained significant and Olympio&#x27;s CUT party was able to win every elected position in the national council. The French were then forced to restore Olympio&#x27;s right to hold office and he became the Prime Minister of the Togo colony and began pressing for independence.

From 1958 until 1961, Olympio served as the prime minister of Togo and also served as the minister of finance, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of justice for the colony. He connected with many of the other independence struggles throughout the continent; for example making Ahmed Sékou Touré, first president of Guinea, &quot;conseiller special&quot; to his government in 1960. In 1961, as part of the transition of power away from French control, the country voted for a president and affirmed the Constitution developed by Olympio and his party. Olympio defeated Grunitzky with over 90% of the vote to become the first president of Togo and the Constitution was approved.

=== Foreign policy ===

Olympio largely pursued a policy of connecting Togo with Britain, the United States and other Western Bloc countries. In 1962, he visited the United States and had a friendly meeting with President John F. Kennedy. In many respects, he was a cultural linkage between British and French West Africa and spoke both languages fluently and connected with the elites in both circles.

==== Togo–Ghana relations ====
One of the defining dynamics during Olympio&#x27;s presidency was the tense relationship between Ghana and Togo. Kwame Nkrumah and Olympio were initially allies working together to gain independence for their neighboring countries; however, the two leaders split when fighting over the western part of the German colony which had become part of the British Gold Coast and eventually part of Ghana. The division resulted in splitting up the land of the Ewe people. Nkrumah proposed openly that Togo and Ghana dissolve the colonial borders and unite while Olympio sought to have the eastern part of the German colony returned to Togo. The relationship became quite tense with Olympio referring to Nkrumah as a &quot;black imperialist&quot; and Nkrumah repeatedly threatening Olympio&#x27;s government.

Relations between the two countries became very tense after 1961 with multiple assassination attempts against each leader resulting in accusations against the other leader and domestic repression leading to refugees receiving support from the other country. Exiles opposing Nkrumah organized in Togo and exiles opposing Olympio organized in Ghana creating a very tense atmosphere.

==== Togo–France relations ====
The French initially treated Olympio with significant hostility during the transition to independence and later, after Olympio became the President in 1961, the French became concerned that Olympio was largely aligned with British and American interests. Olympio adopted a unique position for early independent African leaders of former French territories. Although he tried to rely on little foreign aid, when necessary he relied on German aid rather than French aid. He was not part of the alliances between France and their ex-colonies (notably not joining the African and Malagasy Union) and fostered connections with former British colonies (namely Nigeria) and the United States. Eventually, he began to improve relations with France and when relations with Ghana were at their most tense, he secured a defense pact with the French in order to ensure protection for Togo.

=== Domestic politics ===
Domestic politics was largely defined by Olympio&#x27;s efforts to restrain spending and develop his country without being reliant on outside support and repression of opposition parties.

His austere spending was most significant in the realm of military policy. Initially, Olympio had pushed for Togo to have no military when it achieved independence, but with threats from Nkrumah being a concern, he agreed to a small military (only about 250 soldiers). However, an increasing number of French troops began returning to their homes in Togo and were not provided enlistment in the limited Togolese military because of its small size. Emmanuel Bodjolle and Kléber Dadjo, the leaders in the Togo military, repeatedly tried to get Olympio to increase funding and enlist more of the ex-French army troops returning to the country, but were unsuccessful. On 24 September 1962, Olympio rejected the personal plea by Étienne Eyadéma, a sargent in the French military, to join the Togolese military. On 7 January 1963, Dadjo again presented a request for enlisting ex-French troops and Olympio reportedly tore up the request.

At the same time, Togo largely became a one-party state during Olympio&#x27;s presidency. Following a 1961 unsuccessful attempt on Olympio&#x27;s life in which Grunitzky&#x27;s Togolese Progress Party and the Juvento movement under Antoine Meatchi were accused, the opposition was outlawed. Meatchi was imprisoned for a brief period before being exiled and other opposition leaders left the country. The result was that Olympio maintained a significant amount of authority and his party dominated political life.

== Assassination ==
Shortly after midnight on 13 January 1963, Olympio and his wife were awakened by members of the military breaking into their house. Before dawn, Olympio&#x27;s body was discovered by the U.S. Ambassador Leon B. Poullada three feet from the door to the U.S. Embassy. It was the first coup d&#x27;état in the French and British colonies in Africa that achieved independence in the 1950s and 1960s, and Olympio is remembered as the first president to be assassinated during a military coup in Africa. Étienne Eyadéma, who would claim power in 1967 and remain in office until 2005, claimed to have personally fired the shot that killed Olympio while Olympio tried to escape. Emmanuel Bodjollé became the head of the government for two days until the military created a new government headed by Nicolas Grunitzky, as president, and Antoine Meatchi, as vice president.

The assassination sent shock waves throughout Africa. Guinea, Liberia, the Ivory Coast, and Tanganyika all denounced the coup and the assassination, while only Senegal and Ghana (and to a lesser extent Benin) recognized the government of Grunitzky and Meatchi until elections in May. The government of Togo was excluded from the Addis Ababa Conference which formed the Organisation of African Unity later that year as a result of the coup.

== Aftermath ==
The army increased dramatically from 250 in 1963 to 1,200 by 1966. When protests in the Ewe region, Olympio&#x27;s ethnic group, caused chaos in 1967, the military under Eyadéma deposed the government of Grunitzky. Eyadéma ruled the country from 1967 until 2005. Olympio&#x27;s family remained in exile for much of that period and only returned to the country with democratic openings at the end of Eyadéma&#x27;s rule. Olympio&#x27;s son, Gilchrist Olympio, is the head of the party Union of Forces for Change and has led the main opposition in Togo since the mid-1990s.

<doc id="758875" wikidata="Q214835" url="?curid=758875" title="Bengal fox">
<text>The Bengal fox (Vulpes bengalensis), also known as the Indian fox, is a fox endemic to the Indian subcontinent from the Himalayan foothills and Terai of Nepal through southern India, and from southern and eastern Pakistan to eastern India and southeastern Bangladesh.

==Appearance==

&quot;Vulpes bengalensis&quot; is a relatively small fox with an elongated muzzle, long, pointed ears, and a long, bushy tail. The pelage ranges in color from buff to silver-gray with an overall grizzled effect; the dorsal pelage is mostly grayish and paler ventrally. The legs tend to be brownish or rufous, and the underparts light, a pale sand or ginger shade.

The Bengal fox is more daintily built than the red fox (&quot;V. vulpes&quot;), and can readily be recognized by its bushy, black-tipped tail, which is around 50–60% of the length of the head and body.

The backs of the ears are dark brown with a black margin, and white inside. The ears have the same colour as the nape or maybe darker, but not having a dark patch as in &quot;V. vulpes&quot;. Its rhinarium is naked and the lips are black. The muzzle is pointy, and there may be a dark smudged marking along the upper part of muzzle in front of eyes. Extensive variation in coat colour exists across populations and seasonally within populations, but generally varies from grey to pale brown. The head and body length is , with a long tail. Typical weight is .

The genus &quot;Vulpes&quot; can be separated from &quot;Canis&quot; and &quot;Cuon&quot; in the Indian region by the flat forehead between the postorbital processes and not inflated by air cells. The processes themselves are slightly concave with a raised anterior edge (convexly round in other canids). The canine teeth are longer.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Bengal Fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, ranging from the Himalayan foothills and Terai of Nepal through the South portion of the Indian Peninsula (but the western and east Ghats are not included) and from southern and eastern Pakistan to eastern India and southeastern Bangladesh. In Nepal and northeast India, it occurs up to 1,500 meters long. It was not reported from Afghanistan or Iran or from the Western Ghats, India.

Its range is bounded by the Himalayas and the Indus River valley. It favors semiarid, flat to undulating land, bush and short grassland habitats. It avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands and true deserts. It is relatively widespread in low rainfall areas where the vegetation is usually scrub, thorn or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands. In the Indian peninsula, the species is confined to plains and open scrub forests. It was considered to be a habitat generalist, but it shows a strong preference for semiarid, short grassland habitats at multiple scales.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Bengal foxes are predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal; while individuals may sometimes become active during cool periods of daytime, they typically spend warmer daylight hours under vegetation or in subterranean dens. They use three distinct types of den: basic, compact dens with two openings used for short rest periods, complex dens with multiple openings, and dens under rocks or rock crevices. The basic social unit of the Bengal Fox is the breeding pair, formed by a pair of bonds that can last for many years. Larger aggregations may occur while grown pups linger longer than average in the natal community. Other findings indicate that Bengal foxes can sometimes be more social. Female Bengal foxes were reported to share dens during lactation and four adult foxes were seen emerging from the same den.

Bengal foxes are not especially suspicious of humans and can be found near human habitation. They are easy to tame.

=== Diet ===

Bengal foxes are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders, feeding primarily on insects, small mammals, reptiles, small birds, and fruits.

Their diet consists mainly of orthopterans, termites, ants, beetles, spiders, soft-furred rat (&quot;Millardia meltada&quot;), little Indian field mouse (&quot;Mus booduga&quot;), Indian gerbil (&quot;Tatera indica&quot;), Indian mynah (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;), grey partridge (&quot;Francolinus ponticerianus&quot;) and ashy-crowned finch lark (&quot;Eremopterix griseus&quot;). Less common prey items include ground lizards, oriental rat snake (&quot;Ptyas mucosa&quot;), Madras hedgehog (&quot;Paraechinus nudiventris&quot;) and Indian hare (&quot;Lepus nigricollis&quot;). They feed on fruits of ber (&quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot;), neem (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;), mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;), jambu (&quot;Syzygium cumini&quot;) and banyan (&quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot;). The Bengal fox is also considered to be a predator of eggs and possibly bustard chicks. Scats of young pups indicated that they primarily feed rodents.

===Communication===
Bengal foxes make a wide range of vocalizations. A common vocalization is a &quot;chattering cry&quot; that seems to have a significant role in establishing territoriality and may also be used as a warning call. They also growl, whimper, whine and make a sound which could be called a growl-bark. In reaction to humans, yapping or baying has also been observed. The Bengal fox does not appear to have latrine behaviour, a feature seen in some social canids, in which all members defecate at specific spots. They can be heard howling in the night in groups.

===Reproduction===

Bengal foxes are thought to form long-term monogamous pairs, but this supposition is based on scarce evidence and extra-pair copulations are known to occur. During the breeding season, males vocalize intensely during the night and at dusk and dawn. Throughout most of its range, the mating season occurs in December to January and after a gestation period of around 50–53 days, two to four pups are born in a den. Both parents participate in pup-rearing and protection. Aggregations of grown foxes at den sites have been recorded when the dispersal has been delayed, although the presence of helpers has not been observed. Pups may sometimes be nursed by multiple females, but the relationship between them is uncertain.

During the day, they tend to rest under shrubs and bushes, except in summer when they rest in dens. Play between pups is typical during the first 3 months and consists of vertical jumps, back arching, foreleg stabs, submissive displays, and play solicitation; the adult male sometimes plays with the young. In northwestern India, young foxes are scattered during the monsoon season, when the opportunities are plentiful. The pups are fully weaned about 3–4 months after emerging from the den. Pup mortality is high during the first few months.

==Threats==

While the Bengal fox is common, it usually occurs at low densities across its range, and populations may experience significant fluctuations due to prey abundance and disease (canine distemper virus and rabies, which have been confirmed to cause local population declines in western India). Any human disruptions can be tolerated, but with the increase of human populations and the increased growth of grasslands for agricultural and industrial use, the habitat of the Bengal fox is continually being reduced. The combination of the above causes, combined with disease and/or natural mortality, could potentially cause localized extirpation.

Lack of habitat protection is perhaps the greatest threat to the Bengal fox. For example, in southern India, less than 2% of potential Indian fox habitat is covered under the existing protected area network of the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . Hunting for its skin and flesh, as well as conversion of its grassland habitat to agriculture, industry, and increasingly bio-fuel plantations, have affected its population density. In addition, its body parts are used in traditional medicine, and in some areas it is eaten. They are hunted by the &quot;narikuruva&quot; tribes of southern India. In Karnataka, they are captured in rituals conducted during Sankranthi.

The populations of India are listed in the CITES Appendix III. The Indian Wildlife Conservation Act (1972 as amended to 2005) forbids the hunting of all wildlife and lists the Indian Fox in Schedule II. It does not apply to any particular category in the wildlife protection legislation of Nepal. It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<doc id="758884" wikidata="Q1438624" url="?curid=758884" title="Fort Matanzas National Monument">
<text>Fort Matanzas National Monument () is the site where the Spanish built a fort. It was designated a United States national monument on October 15, 1924. The monument consists of a 1740 Spanish fort called Fort Matanzas, and about 100 acres (0.4 km2) of salt marsh and barrier islands along the Matanzas River on the northern Atlantic coast of Florida. It is operated by the National Park Service in conjunction with the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument in the city of St. Augustine.

==History==
Fort Matanzas was built by the Spanish in 1742 to guard Matanzas Inlet, the southern mouth of the Matanzas River, which could be used as a rear entrance to the city of St. Augustine. Such an approach avoided St. Augustine&#x27;s primary defense system, centered at Castillo de San Marcos. In 1740, Gov. James Oglethorpe of Georgia used the inlet to blockade St. Augustine and launch a thirty-nine-day siege. St. Augustine endured the siege, but the episode convinced the Spanish that protecting the inlet was necessary to the security of the town. Under Gov. Manuel de Montiano&#x27;s orders, construction of the fort began that year and was completed in 1742. Engineer Pedro Ruiz de Olano, who had worked on additions to the Castillo de San Marcos, designed the fortified observation tower. Convicts, slaves, and troops from Cuba were used as labor to erect the structure, which was sited on present-day Rattlesnake Island and had a commanding position over Matanzas Inlet.

The fort, known to the Spanish as &quot;Torre de Matanzas&quot; (Matanzas Tower), is a masonry structure made of coquina, a common shellstone building material in the area. The marshy terrain was stabilized by a foundation of pine pilings to accommodate a building long on each side with a high tower. The standard garrison of the fort was one officer in charge, four infantrymen, and two gunners, though more troops could be stationed if necessary. All soldiers at Fort Matanzas served on rotation from their regular duty in St. Augustine. Five cannon were placed at the fort—four six-pounders and one eighteen-pounder. All guns could reach the inlet, which at the time was less than half a mile away.

In 1742, as the fort was nearing completion, the British under Oglethorpe approached the inlet with twelve ships. Cannon fire drove off the scouting boats, and the warships left without engaging the fort. This brief encounter was the only time Fort Matanzas fired on an enemy. Spain lost control of Florida with the 1763 Treaty of Paris, and regained control with the 1783 Treaty of Paris. With the Spanish Empire falling apart, Spain spent little effort maintaining the fort after this time. When the United States took control of Florida in 1821, the fort had deteriorated to the point where soldiers could not live inside. The United States never used the fort and it became a ruin.

Fort Matanzas was named for the inlet, which acquired its name after the executions, or &quot;matanzas&quot; (Spanish: slaughters), on its north shore, of Jean Ribault and his band of Huguenot Frenchmen, the last of the Fort Caroline colonists, by the Spanish in 1565.

==Restoration and modern use==
In 1916, the U.S Department of War began a major restoration of the badly deteriorated fort. By 1924, three vertical fissures in the wall were repaired and the structure was stabilized; in the same year, National Monument status was proclaimed. Fort Matanzas was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. As a historic area under the Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

==Headquarters and Visitor Center==
The Fort Matanzas National Monument Headquarters and Visitor Center, located at 8635 A1A about south of St. Augustine, Florida, was built in 1936. Located on Anastasia Island, it services the Fort Matanzas National Monument, a five-minute boat ride away. It was designed by the National Park Service&#x27;s Eastern Div. of Plans &amp; Design in what is called National Park Service Rustic architectural style, and includes a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The listing included two contributing buildings and one contributing site on .

The main building is a two-story building with an arched walk-through breezeway that serves as the visitor center and includes a ranger residence as well. The walls of its first floor are made of coquina block masonry, and the second floor is wood framed with wood siding. It has a hipped roof.

The one-story second building, to the north, is also hip-roofed and has coquina walls. It is a utility building that now serves as a ranger office.

Visitors wait at the center to take a five-minute boat ride to the historic Fort Matanzas, which is located across Matanzas Inlet on Rattlesnake Island.

The buildings and the surrounding landscaping was designed by architects of the Eastern Division Branch of Plans and Design of the National Park Service.

Additional designed features include flagstone walkways and sidewalks, an exterior staircase, a retaining wall, parking areas and roads and curbs.

<doc id="758887" wikidata="Q272896" url="?curid=758887" title="Telma Hopkins">
<text>Telma Louise Hopkins (born October 28, 1948) is an American actress and pop singer. Hopkins rose to prominence as a member of the pop group Tony Orlando and Dawn, who had several number-one songs. She also performed on the CBS variety show &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot; from 1974 until 1976 along with Tony Orlando and Joyce Vincent Wilson. In the late 1970s, Hopkins began working as an actress, playing roles on various sitcoms. In the 1980s-1990s, Hopkins endured longer sitcom roles as Isabelle Hammond on &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980–82), Adelaide &quot;Addy&quot; Wilson on &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; (1983–87) and &quot;Family Matters&quot; (1989–1997) as Rachel Baines–Crawford.

As lead actress, Hopkins starred on &quot;Getting By&quot; from 1993 to 1994. In recent years, Hopkins was a regular cast member on &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; (2002–06) portraying Phyllis Thorne, &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; (2010–13), and short-lived &quot;Partners&quot; (2014). In film, Hopkins co-starred in 1984 science fiction film &quot;Trancers&quot; and in its sequels &quot;Trancers II&quot; (1991) and &quot;Trancers III&quot; (1992), as well as appearing in &quot;The Wood&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (2008).

== Early life ==
Hopkins was born on October 28, 1948 in Louisville, Kentucky to Louise (Kinkaid). Hopkins was raised by her grandmother in Highland Park, Michigan, a city located in the Metro Detroit area. Lacking an interest in acting during her childhood, she decided to pursue her dreams of singing.

==Career==
===Music===

Hopkins started her career as a background singer in Detroit, singing background on Golden World, Motown, Invictus Records, and Hot Wax Records hits. She appeared on such classics as Freda Payne&#x27;s &quot;Band of Gold&quot; and Isaac Hayes&#x27; &quot;Theme from Shaft&quot; and working with legendary artists like the Four Tops and Marvin Gaye.

Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson were recruited by Tony Orlando to form the vocal group Dawn. As a recording act, Tony Orlando and Dawn would have much success throughout the first half of the 1970s, releasing 16 top-40 singles, three of which reached #1, and starring in a CBS variety show (titled &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;) from 1974 to 1976. In 1977, Tony Orlando and Dawn announced their retirement.

===Television and film===
In 1979, Hopkins made her acting debut playing Daisy in the ABC miniseries &quot;&quot;. Later that year, she co-starred alongside Eileen Brennan on the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;A New Kind of Family&quot;. The following year, she was cast opposite Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari in another ABC sitcom, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;. The series was cancelled in 1982 after two seasons.

In 1983, Hopkins joined the cast of NBC sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; starring Nell Carter. She played Adelaide &quot;Addy&quot; Wilson, Nell&#x27;s childhood friend, until the series finale in 1987.

In 1989, Hopkins began starring as Rachel Baines-Crawford in the ABC sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;. She left the series after four seasons as a regular cast member, to star (with Cindy Williams) as the co-lead of the sitcom &quot;Getting By&quot; which aired for two seasons (one on ABC, the other on NBC) from 1993 to 1994. She later returned to &quot;Family Matters&quot;, making recurring appearances in the sixth season and guest-starring in the Season 9 Christmas episode &quot;Deck the Malls&quot; in 1997.

In later years, she appeared as Richard T. Jones&#x27; mother in the romantic comedy &quot;The Wood&quot; (1999), and played Romany Malco&#x27;s mother in the comedy film &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (2008). She appeared in JD Lawrence&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Clean Up Woman&quot; in October 2008.

From 2002 to 2006, she starred in the UPN sitcom &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; alongside Rachel True, Essence Atkins and Valarie Pettiford. She also had recurring roles on &quot;The Hughleys&quot; and &quot;Any Day Now&quot;. From 2010 to 2013, she co-starred alongside Terry Crews and Essence Atkins in the TBS sitcom &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;.

In 2014, she played Martin Lawrence&#x27;s mother on the FX sitcom &quot;Partners&quot;. In 2016, she was cast as Jerrika Hinton&#x27;s mother in the ABC comedy pilot &quot;Toast&quot;, produced by ShondaLand.

In May 2021, it was announced Hopkins had been cast in the role of Denise Tolliver on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, reuniting her with &quot;Family Matters&quot; co-star Bryton James.

<text>Freimut Börngen (; 17 October 1930 – 19 June 2021) was a German astronomer and a prolific discoverer of minor planets. A few sources give his first name wrongly as &quot;Freimuth&quot;. The Minor Planet Center credits him as F. Borngen.

He studied galaxies with the Schmidt telescope at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany. In 1995 he retired, but continued to work as a freelancer for the observatory. As a by-product of his work, he discovered numerous asteroids (519, ). The research on asteroids had to be done in his spare time, as the search for small objects was not considered prestigious enough by the GDR research managers. During the GDR regime, Börngen restricted himself to politically neutral names for his asteroids, such as topics related to Thuringia or famous scientists and composers. Examples include 2424 Tautenburg, 3181 Ahnert, 3245 Jensch, or 3941 Haydn. After the German reunification, he chose systematically historical, cultural, scientific and geographical namings, and at times honored amateur astronomers. Other names include references to resistance fighters against the Nazi suppression, or document a religious interest.

Freimut Börngen achieved great reputation in the international scientific community for his human qualities and the well-substantiated choice of names. In 2006, he was awarded the &quot;Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande&quot; (Cross of Merit on ribbon) by German Federal President Horst Köhler.

The main-belt asteroid 3859 Börngen, discovered by astronomer Edward Bowell at the U.S. Anderson Mesa Station in 1987, was named in his honor. The naming and its citation was proposed and written by his colleague Lutz Schmadel, and published on 20 February 1989 ().

Freimut Börngen died on 19 June 2021 at the age of 90.

== List of discovered minor planets ==

Freimut Börngen is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 538 numbered minor planets made between 1961 and 1995.

<doc id="758895" wikidata="Q3348143" url="?curid=758895" title="History of software engineering">
<text>The history of software engineering begins around the 1960s. Writing software has evolved into a profession concerned with how best to maximize the quality of software and of how to create it. Quality can refer to how maintainable software is, to its stability, speed, usability, testability, readability, size, cost, security, and number of flaws or &quot;bugs&quot;, as well as to less measurable qualities like elegance, conciseness, and customer satisfaction, among many other attributes. How best to create high quality software is a separate and controversial problem covering software design principles, so-called &quot;best practices&quot; for writing code, as well as broader management issues such as optimal team size, process, how best to deliver software on time and as quickly as possible, work-place &quot;culture&quot;, hiring practices, and so forth. All this falls under the broad rubric of software engineering.

== Overview ==
The evolution of software engineering is notable in a number of areas:
* Emergence as a profession: By the early 1980s software engineering had already emerged as a &quot;bona fide&quot; profession, to stand beside computer science and traditional engineering.
* Role of women: Before 1970 men filling the more prestigious and better paying hardware engineering roles often delegated the writing of software to women, and legends such as Grace Hopper or Margaret Hamilton filled many computer programming jobs. Today, fewer women work in software engineering than in other professions, a situation whose cause is not clearly identified. Many academic and professional organizations consider this situation unbalanced and are trying hard to solve it.
* Processes: Processes have become a big part of software engineering. They are hailed for their potential to improve software but sharply criticized for their potential to constrict programmers.
* Cost of hardware: The relative cost of software versus hardware has changed substantially over the last 50 years. When mainframes were expensive and required large support staffs, the few organizations buying them also had the resources to fund large, expensive custom software engineering projects. Computers are now much more numerous and much more powerful, which has several effects on software. The larger market can support large projects to create commercial off the shelf software, as done by companies such as Microsoft. The cheap machines allow each programmer to have a terminal capable of fairly rapid compilation. The programs in question can use techniques such as garbage collection, which make them easier and faster for the programmer to write. On the other hand, many fewer organizations are interested in employing programmers for large custom software projects, instead using commercial off the shelf software as much as possible.

== 1945 to 1965: The origins ==
Early usages for the term &quot;software engineering&quot; include a 1965 letter from ACM president Anthony Oettinger, lectures by Douglas T. Ross at MIT in the 1950s. Margaret H. Hamilton is the person who came up with the idea of naming the discipline, software engineering, as a way of giving it legitimacy during the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer.

The NATO Science Committee sponsored two conferences on software engineering in 1968 (Garmisch, Germany) and 1969, which gave the field its initial boost. Many believe these conferences marked the official start of the profession of &quot;software engineering&quot;.

== 1965 to 1985: The software crisis and operating systems ==
Software engineering was spurred by the so-called &quot;software crisis&quot; of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, which identified many of the problems of software development. Many projects ran over budget and schedule. Some projects caused property damage. A few projects caused loss of life. The software crisis was originally defined in terms of productivity, but evolved to emphasize quality. Some used the term &quot;software crisis&quot; to refer to their inability to hire enough qualified programmers. During this time, Silicon Valley cemented itself as the best location for software engineers to work. 
* Cost and Budget Overruns: The OS/360 operating system was a classic example. This decade-long project from the 1960s eventually produced one of the most complex software systems at the time. OS/360 was one of the first large (1000 programmers) software projects. Fred Brooks claims in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; that he made a multimillion-dollar mistake of not developing a coherent architecture before starting development.
* Property Damage: Software defects can cause property damage. Poor software security allows hackers to steal identities, costing time, money, and reputations.
* Life and Death: Software defects can kill. Embedded systems used in radiotherapy machines prove the ability to fail so catastrophically that they administered lethal doses of radiation to patients. The most famous of these failures are the &quot;Therac-25&quot; incidents.

Peter G. Neumann has kept a contemporary list of software problems and disasters. The software crisis has been fading from view, because it is psychologically extremely difficult to remain in crisis mode for a protracted period (more than 20 years). Nevertheless, software – especially real-time embedded software – remains risky and is pervasive, and it is crucial not to give in to complacency. Over the last 10–15 years Michael A. Jackson has written extensively about the nature of software engineering, has identified the main source of its difficulties as lack of specialization, and has suggested that his problem frames provide the basis for a &quot;normal practice&quot; of software engineering, a prerequisite if software engineering is to become an engineering science.

One of the largest projects undertaken by software engineers during this time period was the development of modern operating systems. Starting in Bell Labs and then moving to UC Berkeley, software engineers worked to create Unix V6 in 1975, a landmark operating system that set standards for future operating systems. Future operating systems built on Unix V6&#x27;s methods, and its descendants can be grouped into five types of operating system paradigms. In contrast with Unix, software engineers at MIT in 1983 built GNU (literally &quot;GNU&#x27;s Not Unix&quot;) as an open source alternative to Unix. As an early open source software, GNU was beloved by a small group of developers and its work grew the open source software development community in the 80s.

== 1985 to 1989: &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot; ==
For decades, solving the software crisis was paramount to researchers and companies producing software tools.
The cost of owning and maintaining software in the 1980s was twice as expensive as developing the software.
* During the 1990s, the cost of ownership and maintenance increased by 30% over the 1980s.
* In 1995, statistics showed that half of surveyed development projects were operational, but were not considered successful.
* The average software project overshoots its schedule by half.
* Three-quarters of all large software products delivered to the customer are failures that are either not used at all, or do not meet the customer&#x27;s requirements.

=== Software projects ===
Seemingly, every new technology and practice from the 1970s through the 1990s was trumpeted as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; to solve the software crisis. Tools, discipline, formal methods, process, and professionalism were touted as silver bullets:

* Tools: Especially emphasized were tools: structured programming, object-oriented programming, CASE tools such as ICL&#x27;s CADES CASE system, Ada, documentation, and standards were touted as silver bullets.
* Discipline: Some pundits argued that the software crisis was due to the lack of discipline of programmers.
* Formal methods: Some believed that if formal engineering methodologies would be applied to software development, then production of software would become as predictable an industry as other branches of engineering. They advocated proving all programs correct.
* Process: Many advocated the use of defined processes and methodologies like the Capability Maturity Model.
* Professionalism: This led to work on a code of ethics, licenses, and professionalism.

In 1986, Fred Brooks published his &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot; article, arguing that no individual technology or practice would ever make a 10-fold improvement in productivity within 10 years.

Debate about silver bullets raged over the following decade. Advocates for Ada, components, and processes continued arguing for years that their favorite technology would be a silver bullet. Skeptics disagreed. Eventually, almost everyone accepted that no silver bullet would ever be found. Yet, claims about &quot;silver bullets&quot; pop up now and again, even today.

Some interpret &quot;no silver bullet&quot; to mean that software engineering failed. However, with further reading, Brooks goes on to say: &quot;We will surely make substantial progress over the next 40 years; an order of magnitude over 40 years is hardly magical ...&quot;

The search for a single key to success never worked. All known technologies and practices have only made incremental improvements to productivity and quality. Yet, there are no silver bullets for any other profession, either. Others interpret &quot;no silver bullet&quot; as proof that software engineering has finally matured and recognized that projects succeed due to hard work.

However, it could also be said that there are, in fact, a range of &quot;silver bullets&quot; today, including lightweight methodologies (see &quot;Project management&quot;), spreadsheet calculators, customized browsers, in-site search engines, database report generators, integrated design-test coding-editors with memory/differences/undo, and specialty shops that generate niche software, such as information web sites, at a fraction of the cost of totally customized web site development. Nevertheless, the field of software engineering appears too complex and diverse for a single &quot;silver bullet&quot; to improve most issues, and each issue accounts for only a small portion of all software problems.

== 1990 to 1999: Prominence of the Internet ==
The rise of the Internet led to very rapid growth in the demand for international information display/e-mail systems on the World Wide Web. Programmers were required to handle illustrations, maps, photographs, and other images, plus simple animation, at a rate never before seen, with few well-known methods to optimize image display/storage (such as the use of thumbnail images).

The growth of browser usage, running on the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), changed the way in which information-display and retrieval was organized. The widespread network connections led to the growth and prevention of international computer viruses on MS Windows computers, and the vast proliferation of spam e-mail became a major design issue in e-mail systems, flooding communication channels and requiring semi-automated pre-screening. Keyword-search systems evolved into web-based search engines, and many software systems had to be re-designed, for international searching, depending on search engine optimization (SEO) . Human natural-language translation systems were needed to attempt to translate the information flow in multiple foreign languages, with many software systems being designed for multi-language usage, based on design concepts from human translators. Typical computer-user bases went from hundreds, or thousands of users, to, often, many-millions of international users.

== 2000 to 2015: Lightweight methodologies ==
With the expanding demand for software in many smaller organizations, the need for inexpensive software solutions led to the growth of simpler, faster methodologies that developed running software, from requirements to deployment, quicker &amp; easier. The use of rapid-prototyping evolved to entire &quot;lightweight methodologies&quot;, such as Extreme Programming (XP), which attempted to simplify many areas of software engineering, including requirements gathering and reliability testing for the growing, vast number of small software systems. Very large software systems still used heavily documented methodologies, with many volumes in the documentation set; however, smaller systems had a simpler, faster alternative approach to managing the development and maintenance of software calculations and algorithms, information storage/retrieval and display.

=== Current trends in software engineering ===
Software engineering is a young discipline, and is still developing. The directions in which software engineering is developing include:

==== Aspects ====
Aspects help software engineers deal with quality attributes by providing tools to add or remove boilerplate code from many areas in the source code. Aspects describe how all objects or functions should behave in particular circumstances. For example, aspects can add debugging, logging, or locking control into all objects of particular types. Researchers are currently working to understand how to use aspects to design general-purpose code. Related concepts include generative programming and templates.

==== Experimental ====
Experimental software engineering is a branch of software engineering interested in devising experiments on software, in collecting data from the experiments, and in devising laws and theories from this data.

==== Software product lines ====
Software product lines, aka product family engineering, is a systematic way to produce &quot;families&quot; of software systems, instead of creating a succession of completely individual products. This method emphasizes extensive, systematic, formal code reuse, to try to industrialize the software development process.

The Future of Software Engineering conference (FOSE), held at ICSE 2000, documented the state of the art of SE in 2000 and listed many problems to be solved over the next decade. The FOSE tracks at the ICSE 2000 and the ICSE 2007 conferences also help identify the state of the art in software engineering.

=== Software engineering today ===
The profession is trying to define its boundary and content. The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge SWEBOK has been tabled as an ISO standard during 2006 (ISO/IEC TR 19759).

In 2006, &quot;Money Magazine&quot; and &quot;Salary.com&quot; rated software engineering as the best job in America in terms of growth, pay, stress levels, flexibility in hours and working environment, creativity, and how easy it is to enter and advance in the field.

== Sub-disciplines ==

=== Artificial intelligence ===
A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from expert systems such as Cyc to deep learning to robot platforms such as the Roomba with open interface. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries, including Deeplearning4j, TensorFlow, Theano and Torch.

A 2011 McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data and AI professionals and managers and a number of private bootcamps have developed programs to meet that demand, including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs like General Assembly.

==== Languages ====

Early symbolic AI inspired Lisp and Prolog, which dominated early AI programming. Modern AI development often uses mainstream languages such as Python or C++, or niche languages such as Wolfram Language.

<text>Richard William Hamilton (24 February 1922 – 13 September 2011) was an English painter and collage artist. His 1955 exhibition &quot;Man, Machine and Motion&quot; (Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) and his 1956 collage &quot;Just what is it that makes today&#x27;s homes so different, so appealing?&quot;, produced for the &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; exhibition of the Independent Group in London, are considered by critics and historians to be among the earliest works of pop art. A major retrospective of his work was at Tate Modern in 2014.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Pimlico, London on 24 February 1922. Despite having left school with no formal qualifications, he managed to gain employment as an apprentice working at an electrical components firm, where he discovered an ability for draughtsmanship and began to do painting at evening classes at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art and at the Westminster School of Art. In 1938, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Arts.

After spending World War II working as a technical draftsman, he re-enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools but was expelled in 1946 on grounds of &quot;not profiting from the instruction&quot;. Loss of his student status forced Hamilton to carry out National Service. After two years at the Slade School of Art, University College London, Hamilton began exhibiting his work at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), where he also produced posters and leaflets. He taught at the Central School of Art and Design from 1952 until 1966.

==1950s–1960s==
Hamilton&#x27;s early work was much influenced by D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson&#x27;s 1917 text &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;. In 1951, Hamilton staged an exhibition called &quot;Growth and Form&quot; at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. A pioneering form of installation art, it featured scientific models, diagrams and photographs presented as a unified artwork. In 1952, at the first Independent Group meeting, held at the ICA, Hamilton was introduced to Eduardo Paolozzi&#x27;s seminal presentation of collages produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s that are now considered to be the first standard bearers of Pop Art. Also in 1952, he was introduced to the &quot;Green Box&quot; notes of Marcel Duchamp through Roland Penrose, whom Hamilton had met at the ICA. At the ICA, Hamilton was responsible for the design and installation of a number of exhibitions including one on James Joyce and &quot;The Wonder and the Horror of the Human Head&quot; that was curated by Penrose. It was also through Penrose that Hamilton met Victor Pasmore who gave him a teaching post in the Fine Art Department of Durham University at Newcastle upon Tyne, which lasted until 1966. Among the students Hamilton tutored at Newcastle in this period were Rita Donagh, Mark Lancaster, Tim Head, Roxy Music founder Bryan Ferry and Ferry&#x27;s visual collaborator Nicholas de Ville. Hamilton&#x27;s influence can be found in the visual styling and approach of Roxy Music. He described Ferry as &quot;his greatest creation&quot;. Ferry repaid the compliment, naming him in 2010 as the living person he most admired, saying &quot;he greatly influenced my ways of seeing art and the world&quot;.

Hamilton gave a 1959 lecture, &quot;Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking Cinemascope and Stereophonic Sound&quot;, a phrase taken from a Cole Porter lyric in the 1957 musical &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;. In that lecture, which sported a pop soundtrack and the demonstration of an early Polaroid camera, Hamilton deconstructed the technology of cinema to explain how it helped to create Hollywood’s allure. He further developed that theme in the early 1960s with a series of paintings inspired by film stills and publicity shots.

The post at the ICA also afforded Hamilton the time to further his research on Duchamp, which resulted in the 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Green Box&quot;, which comprised Duchamp&#x27;s original notes for the design and construction of his famous work &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even&quot;, also known as &quot;The Large Glass&quot;. Hamilton&#x27;s 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition &quot;Man Machine Motion&quot; at the Hatton Gallery in the Fine Art Department at King&#x27;s College, Durham (now Newcastle University). Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. &quot;Just what is it that makes today&#x27;s homes so different, so appealing?&quot; was created in 1956 for the catalogue of &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot;, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. &quot;Just what is it that makes today&#x27;s homes so different, so appealing?&quot; is widely acknowledged as one of the first pieces of pop art. Hamilton&#x27;s written definition of what &quot;pop&quot; is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton&#x27;s definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: &quot;Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business&quot;, stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.

The success of &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; secured Hamilton further teaching assignments in particular at the Royal College of Art from 1957 to 1961, where he promoted David Hockney and Peter Blake. During this period Hamilton was also very active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and produced a work parodying the then leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell for rejecting a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In the early 1960s he received a grant from the Arts Council to investigate the condition of the Kurt Schwitters Merzbau in Cumbria. The research eventually resulted in Hamilton organising the preservation of the work by relocating it to the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle University Fine Art Department.

In his works, Hamilton frequently incorporated the materials of consumer society. &quot;Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?&quot; (1956) used American magazines, brought back from the United States by John McHale and Magda Cordell.
Hamilton also incorporated pieces of plastic directly into his collages. In &quot;Pin-up&quot; (1961), a mixed-media work exploring the female nude, sculpted plastic was used for the breasts of the nude figure. &quot;$he&quot; (1959–1961) incorporated a plastic holographic eye, given to Hamilton by Herbert Ohl.
 The use of plastics has created significant challenges in conserving Hamilton&#x27;s works. As early as 1964, when &quot;Pin-up&quot; and &quot;$he&quot; were loaned for a solo show of Hamilton&#x27;s works at the Hanover Gallery in London, they were found to be cracked, with plastic lifting off the supporting surfaces. Hamilton experimented with materials, including plywood, acrylic glass, and plasticizers, and worked closely with conservators to repair his works and develop better techniques for incorporating and conserving plastics in artworks.

In 1962 his first wife Terry was killed in a car accident. In part to recover from her loss, in 1963 Hamilton travelled for the first time to the United States for a retrospective of the works of Marcel Duchamp at the Pasadena Art Museum, where, as well as meeting other leading pop artists, he was befriended by Duchamp. Arising from this Hamilton curated the first British retrospective of Duchamp&#x27;s work, and his familiarity with &quot;The Green Box&quot; enabled Hamilton to make copies of &quot;The Large Glass&quot; and other glass works too fragile to travel. The exhibition was shown at the Tate Gallery in 1966.

In 1968, Hamilton appeared in a Brian De Palma film titled &quot;Greetings&quot; where Hamilton portrays a pop artist showing a &quot;Blow Up&quot; image. The film was Robert De Niro&#x27;s first motion picture, and the first film in the United States to appeal an X rating.
From the mid-1960s, Hamilton was represented by Robert Fraser and even produced a series of prints, &quot;Swingeing London&quot;, based on Fraser&#x27;s arrest, along with Mick Jagger, for possession of drugs. This association with the 1960s pop music scene continued as Hamilton became friends with Paul McCartney resulting in him producing the cover design and poster collage for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;.

In 1969, Hamilton appeared in a documentary by filmmaker James Scott, in which he discussed the &quot;Swingeing London&quot; series and his preoccupation with mass media through a selection of his own work.

==1970s–2011==
During the 1970s, Richard Hamilton enjoyed international acclaim with a number of major exhibitions being organised of his work. Hamilton had found a new companion in painter Rita Donagh. Together they set about converting North End, a farm in the Oxfordshire countryside, into a home and studios. &quot;By 1970, always fascinated by new technology, Hamilton was redirecting advances in product design into fine art, with the backing of xartcollection, Zurich, a young company that pioneered the production of multiples with the aim of bringing art to a wider audience.&quot; Hamilton realised a series of projects that blurred the boundaries between artwork and product design including a painting that incorporated a state-of-the-art radio receiver and the casing of a Dataindustrier AB computer. During the 1980s Hamilton again voyaged into industrial design and designed two computer exteriors: OHIO computer prototype (for a Swedish firm named &quot;Isotron&quot;, 1984) and DIAB DS-101 (for Dataindustrier AB, 1986). As part of a television project, 1987 BBC series Painting with Light Hamilton was introduced to the Quantel Paintbox and subsequently purchased one for his studio to produce and modify his work.

From the late 1970s Hamilton’s activity was concentrated largely on investigations of printmaking processes, often in unusual and complex combinations. In 1977–78 Hamilton undertook a series of collaborations with the artist Dieter Roth that also blurred the definitions of the artist as sole author of their work.

In 1992, Richard Hamilton was commissioned by the BBC to recreate his famous art piece, &quot;Just What Is It That Makes Today&#x27;s Homes So Different, So Appealing?&quot; but only this time, as to what he felt the average household would be like during the 1990s. Instead of the male body builder, he used an accountant working at a desk. Instead of the female icon, he used a world class female body builder.

In 1981 Hamilton began work on a trilogy of paintings based on the conflict in Northern Ireland after watching a television documentary about the &quot;Blanket&quot; protest organized by IRA prisoners in Long Kesh Prison, officially known as The Maze. &quot;The citizen&quot; (1981–1983) shows IRA prisoner Hugh Rooney portrayed as Jesus, with long flowing hair and a beard. Republican prisoners had refused to wear prison uniforms, claiming that they were political prisoners. Prison officers refused to let &quot;the blanket protesters&quot; use the toilets unless they wore prison uniforms. The republican prisoners refused, and instead smeared the excrement on the wall of their cells. Hamilton explained (in the catalogue to his Tate Gallery exhibition, 1992), that he saw the image of &quot;the blanket man as a public relations contrivance of enormous efficacy. It had the moral conviction of a religious icon and the persuasiveness of the advertising man&#x27;s dream soap commercial - yet it was a present reality&quot;. &quot;The subject&quot; (1988–89) shows an Orangeman, a member of an order dedicated to preserve Unionism in Northern Ireland. &quot;The state&quot; (1993) shows a British soldier on a &quot;foot&quot; patrol on a street. &quot;The citizen&quot; was shown as part of &quot;A Cellular Maze&quot;, a 1983 joint exhibition with Donagh at the Orchard Gallery in Derry. The pair created a yellow pamphlet appropriating the style of 17th Century political pamphlets distributed by the Diggers and Ditchers to link the cause of Republican strikers to previous historic struggles.

From the late 1940s Richard Hamilton was engaged with a project to produce a suite of illustrations for James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In 1988, the Orchard Gallery, Derry did an exhibition and publication entitled, &quot;Work in Progress&quot; of the copper plate etchings Hamilton had been making since the 1940s. Before this an unsuccessful attempt had been made alongside Joseph Beuys to display the etchings, alongside the additional two chapters of Ulysses that Beuys had authored. The proposed show was to take place on 7.7.77 - a magic date in Joyce&#x27;s thinking at the lighthouse in Sandycove but was terminated due to the property owners worries about the fragility of Joyce&#x27;s original manuscripts. In 2002, the British Museum staged an exhibition of Hamilton&#x27;s illustrations of James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses, entitled &quot;Imaging Ulysses&quot;. A book of Hamilton&#x27;s illustrations was published simultaneously, with text by Stephen Coppel. In the book, Hamilton explained that the idea of illustrating this complex, experimental novel occurred to him when he was doing his National Service in 1947. His first preliminary sketches were made while at the Slade School of Art, and he continued to refine and re-work the images over the next 50 years. Hamilton felt his re-working of the illustrations in many different media had produced a visual effect analogous to Joyce&#x27;s verbal techniques. The &quot;Ulysses&quot; illustrations were subsequently exhibited at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (in Dublin) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (in Rotterdam). The British Museum exhibition coincided with both the 80th anniversary of the publication of Joyce&#x27;s novel, and Richard Hamilton&#x27;s 80th birthday.

Hamilton died on 13 September 2011, at the age of 89. His work &quot;Le chef d’oeuvre inconnu – a painting in three parts&quot;, unfinished at his death, comprises a trio of large inkjet prints composed from Photoshop images to visualize the moment of crisis in Balzac’s novel &quot;The Unknown Masterpiece&quot;.

==Exhibitions==
The first exhibition of Hamilton&#x27;s paintings was shown at the Hanover Gallery, London, in 1955. In 1993 Hamilton represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale and was awarded the Golden Lion. Major retrospective exhibitions have been organized by the Tate Gallery, London, 1970 and 1992, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1973, MACBA, Barcelona, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, 2003, and the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, 1974. Some of the group exhibitions Hamilton participated in include: Documenta 4, Kassel, 1968; São Paulo Art Biennial, 1989; Documenta X, Kassel 1997; Gwangju Biennale, 2004; and Shanghai Biennale, 2006. In 2010, the Serpentine Gallery presented Hamilton’s ‘Modern Moral Matters’, an exhibition focusing on his political and protest works which were shown previously in 2008 at Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. For the season 2001/2002 in the Vienna State Opera Richard Hamilton designed the large scale picture (176 sqm) &quot;Retard en Fer – Delay in Iron&quot; as part of the exhibition series &quot;Safety Curtain&quot;, conceived by museum in progress. Just the week prior to his death the artist was working with the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, to prepare a major museum retrospective of his oeuvre that had already been scheduled to open first at Tate Modern, London, on 13 February 2014, travelling later to Madrid where it will open on 24 June 2014.

In 2011 Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane showed a joint retrospective exhibition of both Hamilton&#x27;s and Rita Donagh&#x27;s work called &quot;Civil Rights etc.&quot; That same year, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts showcased Hamilton&#x27;s work in &quot;Richard Hamilton: Pop Art Pioneer, 1922-2011&quot;. The National Gallery’s &quot;Richard Hamilton: The Late Works&quot; opened in 2012. A major retrospective at Tate Modern in 2014 was &quot;the first retrospective to encompass the full scope of Hamilton’s work, from his early exhibition designs of the 1950s to his final paintings of 2011. [The] exhibition explores his relationship to design, painting, photography and television, as well as his engagement and collaborations with other artists&quot;.

==Collections==
The Tate Gallery has a comprehensive collection of Hamilton&#x27;s work from across his career. In 1996, the Kunstmuseum Winterthur received a substantial gift of Hamilton&#x27;s prints, making the museum the largest repository of the artist&#x27;s prints in the world.

==Recognition==
Hamilton was awarded the William and Noma Copley Foundation Award, 1960; the John Moores Painting Prize, 1969; the Talens Prize International, 1970; the Leone d’Oro for his exhibition in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, 1993; the Arnold Bode Prize at Documenta X, Kassel, 1997; and the Max Beckmann Prize for Painting of the City of Frankfurt, 2006. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 2000. He was presented with a special award by The Bogside Artists of Derry at the Royal College of Art in 2010. The School of Arts building at Oxford Brookes University is named in his honour.

==Art market==
Hamilton has been represented by The Robert Fraser Gallery. The Alan Cristea Gallery in London is the distributor of Hamilton&#x27;s prints. His auction record is £440,000, set at Sotheby&#x27;s, London, in February 2006, for &quot;Fashion Plate, Cosmetic Study X&quot; (1969) For a 2014 retrospective at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, the government-owned museum insured 246 works of Hamilton for 115.6 million euros ($157 million) against loss or damage, according to an order published as law by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports.

<doc id="758905" wikidata="Q632240" url="?curid=758905" title="Eli Lilly and Company">
<text>Eli Lilly and Company, doing business as Lilly, is an American multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, with offices in 18 countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran during the American Civil War for whom the company was later named.

As of October 2024, Lilly is the most valuable drug company in the world with a $842 billion market capitalization, the highest valuation ever achieved to date by a drug company. The company is ranked 127th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 with revenue of $34.12 billion. It is ranked 221st on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000 list of the world&#x27;s largest publicly-traded companies and 252nd on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Employers&quot;.

Lilly is known for its clinical depression drugs Prozac (fluoxetine) (1986), Cymbalta (duloxetine) (2004), and its antipsychotic medication Zyprexa (olanzapine) (1996). The company&#x27;s primary revenue drivers are the diabetes drugs Humalog (insulin lispro) (1996) and Trulicity (dulaglutide) (2014).

Lilly was the first company to mass-produce both the polio vaccine, developed in 1955 by Jonas Salk, and insulin. It was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA, including Humulin (insulin medication), Humalog (insulin lispro), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the U.S., Basaglar (insulin glargine). Lilly brought exenatide to market—the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonists—followed by blockbuster drugs in the same class such as Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide). 

As of 1997, it was both the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana. In 2009, Lilly pleaded guilty for illegally marketing Zyprexa and agreed to pay a $1.415 billion penalty that included a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind at the time.

Lilly is a full member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).

==History==
===Founding===

The company was founded by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War. Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.

In 1869, after working for drugstores in Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois-based drugstore with James W. Binford. Four years later, in 1873, Lilly left the partnership with Binford, and returned to Indianapolis. In 1874, Lilly partnered with John F. Johnston, and opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly. 

Two years later, in 1876, Lilly dissolved the partnership, and used his share of the assets to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business, Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis. The sign outside, above the shop&#x27;s door, read: &quot;Eli Lilly, Chemist.&quot; 

Lilly began his manufacturing venture with three employees, including his son, Josiah (J. K.). One of the first medicines that Lilly produced was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria, a mosquito-borne disease. By the end of 1876, sales reached $4,470.

===19th century===
In 1878, Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman, and the subsequent sales team marketed the company&#x27;s drugs nationally. By 1879, the company had grown to $48,000 in sales.

The company moved its Indianapolis headquarters from Pearl Street to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881, the company moved to its current headquarters in Indianapolis&#x27;s south-side industrial area, and the company later purchased additional facilities for research and production. The same year, Lilly incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.

Lilly&#x27;s first innovative product was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company&#x27;s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.

In 1882, Colonel Lilly&#x27;s only son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in Philadelphia, and returned to Indianapolis to join the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory.

In 1883, the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a &quot;blood purifier&quot; and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis. Sales from the product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities. By the late 1880s, Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area&#x27;s leading businessmen, whose company had over 100 employees and $200,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.

In 1890, Colonel Lilly fully turned over the day-to-day management of the business to J. K., who ran the company for 34 years. The 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, but the company flourished. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.

In 1898, Lilly&#x27;s son, J. K. Lilly, inherited the company and became its president following Colonel Lilly&#x27;s death. At the time of Colonel Lilly&#x27;s death, the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars). Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.

As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis&#x27;s near south side. The area developed into one of the city&#x27;s major business and industrial hubs. Lilly&#x27;s production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings, which covered 15-block area, in addition to its production plants along Kentucky Avenue.

In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly&#x27;s cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper. As young boys, Lilly&#x27;s grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.

Under J. K.&#x27;s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company&#x27;s research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.

For the rest of the late 19th century, Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did, manufacturing and selling &quot;sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups&quot;. The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, &quot;Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs than the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research.&quot;

===20th century===



In 1905, J. K. Lilly oversaw a large expansion of the company, and it reached annual sales of $1 million ($ in 2015 chained dollars).

Before and after World War I, the company experienced rapid growth, including expanded manufacturing facilities at its McCarty Street plant, which improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913. Om 1913, the company began construction of Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana.

In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage. Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others. 

In 1917, &quot;Scientific American&quot; described Lilly as &quot;the largest capsule factory in the world&quot; and reported that the company was &quot;capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day&quot;. One of Lilly&#x27;s early innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow. Over the next few years, the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.

Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. In 1909, Eli Lilly, grandson of the company&#x27;s founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets, which created multiples copies of a drug formula and helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors. 

In 1919, Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.

In the 1920s, Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production to the pharmaceutical industry, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company&#x27;s manufacturing process. Under Eli&#x27;s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new five-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs. One historian noted, &quot;It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry.&quot; This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly&#x27;s regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.

During the 1920s, the introduction of new products brought the company financial success. In 1921, three University of Toronto scientists, John Macleod, Frederick Banting, and Charles Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes. Clowes proposed a collaboration with the researchers in December 1921, and then again March and May 1922. The researchers were hesitant to work with a commercial drug firm, particularly since they had the Connaught Laboratories&#x27; non-commercial facilities at hand. But as limits were reached at the scale to which Connaught could produce insulin, Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin. The collaboration greatly accelerated the large-scale production of the extract.

In 1923, the company began selling Iletin, the company&#x27;s tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes. Numerous objections were registered by the Insulin Committee of the University of Toronto in regard to Lilly&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Iletin&quot;, although production continued under this name and the objection was later dropped &quot;as a concession&quot;.

Also in 1923, Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize for their research, which they subsequently shared with co-discoverers Charles Best and James Collip. Insulin, &quot;the most important drug&quot; in the company&#x27;s history, did &quot;more than any other&quot; to make Lilly &quot;one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world.&quot; Eli Lilly and Company enjoyed an effective monopoly on the sale of insulin in the U.S. for almost two years, until the first of the new American licensees, Frederick Stearns &amp; Co., entered the market in June 1924.

The success of insulin enabled the company to attract scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1926, its sales had reached $9 million and it was producing over 2,800 products.

In 1928, Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930, Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist. Four years later, in 1934, Minot, Murphy, and Whipple were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research.

In the 1930s, the company also continued expansion overseas. In 1934, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company&#x27;s first overseas subsidiary was established in London, and a manufacturing plant was opened in Basingstoke.

In 1932, despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly&#x27;s sales rose to $13 million. The same year, Eli Lilly, eldest grandson of Col. Lilly who had joined the company in 1909, was named as the company&#x27;s president, succeeding his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. In his early years at the company, Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles, implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company, and expanded the company&#x27;s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.

In 1934, the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly&#x27;s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, &quot;one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world.&quot; 

During World War II, the company expanded production to a new high, manufacturing merthiolate, an organomercury compound, and penicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic. Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma. By the end of World War II, the company had dried over two million pints of blood, &quot;about 20 percent of the United States&#x27; total&quot;. Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an &quot;antiseptic and germicide&quot; that became a U.S. Army standard issue during World War II.

International operations expanded even further during World War II. In 1943, Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948, Lilly employees worked in 35 countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

In 1945, Lilly began a major expansion effort that included two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on Kentucky Avenue, west of the company&#x27;s McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company&#x27;s shipping department. By 1948, Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.

In 1948, Eli Lilly, who served as the company&#x27;s president since 1932, retired from active management, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly Jr. (Joe). During Eli&#x27;s 16-year presidency, sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company&#x27;s personnel and marketing efforts. He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board, and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.

Throughout the mid-20th century, Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950, Lilly launched Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana, and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. 

In the 1950s, Lilly introduced two new antibiotics, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, and erythromycin. In the 1950s and 1960s, as generic drugs began flooding the marketplace after the expiration of patents, Lilly diversified into other areas, including agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicine products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.

In 1952, the company offered its first public shares of stock, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1953, Eugene N. Beesley was named the company&#x27;s new president, the first non-family member to run the company.

In 1953, following a company reorganization and transition to non-family management, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In 1954, Lilly formed Elanco Products Company, named after its parent company, for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals.

Also in 1954, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now the March of Dimes, contracted with five pharmaceutical companies, Lilly, Cutter Laboratories, Parke, Davis and Company, Pitman-Moore Company, and Wyeth Laboratories to produce Salk&#x27;s polio vaccine for clinical trials. Lilly&#x27;s selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers. In 1955, Lilly manufactured 60 percent of Salk&#x27;s polio vaccine.

In the 1960s, Lilly operated 13 affiliate companies outside the United States. In 1962, the company acquired The Distillers Company and established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968, Lilly built its first research facility outside the United States, the Lilly Research Centre, in Surrey, England. In 1969, the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company underwent a flurry of drug production, including Keflex, an antibiotic, in 1971, Dobutrex, a cardiogenic shock heart drug in 1977, Ceclore, which ultimately became the world&#x27;s top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979, Eldisine, a leukemia drug, Oraflex, an arthritis drug, and Darvon, an opioid drug used in pain management.

In 1971, the company became a component of the S&amp;P 500 Index. To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, acquiring cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although Arden continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped to ultimately turn it into a financial success. By 1982, Arden&#x27;s &quot;sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million.&quot; In 1987, 16 years after acquiring it, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé for $657 million.

In 1977, Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. The same year, Lilly acquired Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., a manufacturer of heart pacemakers. In 1980, Lilly acquired Physio-Control, a pioneering company in defibrillation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovascular Systems in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, Devices for Vascular Intervention, in 1989, Pacific Biotech in 1990, and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, in 1992. In the early 1990s, Lilly combined its newly acquired medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that &quot;contributed about 20 percent&quot; of Lilly&#x27;s annual revenues.

In 1989, a joint agrochemical venture between Elanco and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997, Lilly sold its 40% share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.

In 1991, Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly and Company. During Bryson&#x27;s 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company. 

In 1993, Randall L. Tobias, vice chairman of AT&amp;T Corporation and a Lilly board member, was named Lilly&#x27;s chairman, president, and CEO after &quot;product and competitive pressures&quot; had &quot;steadily eroded Lilly&#x27;s stock price since early 1992.&quot; Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias&#x27;s leadership, the company &quot;cut costs and narrowed its mission&quot;. Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. 

In 1994, Lilly acquired PCS Systems, the largest drug benefits health maintenance organization at the time, for $4 billion, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.

In 1998, Sidney Taurel, Lilly&#x27;s former chief operating officer, was named CEO, replacing Tobias. Also in 1998, Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In January 1999, Taurel was named chairman. In 2000, Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.

===21st century===
In September 2002, Lilly agreed to partner with Amylin Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize Amylin&#x27;s exotic new drug based on exendin-4, a novel substance isolated from the venom of the Gila monster. Exenatide, the first of the GLP-1 receptor agonists, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2005.

In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share. After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly increased its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued. But Lilly&#x27;s offer was approved by Icos&#x27; shareholders, and Lilly completed the acquisition of the company in January 2007. Lilly subsequently closed Icos&#x27; manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, leaving 127 employees working at the biologics facility. In December 2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell, Washington-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.

In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion, was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.

In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly announced a global agreement to jointly develop and market new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than $1 billion for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs. Boehringer Ingelheim&#x27;s oral anti-diabetic Linagliptin, BI 1077, and two of Lilly&#x27;s insulin analogs, LY2605541 and LY2963016, were in phase II and III of clinical development at that time.

In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to acquire Switzerland-based Novartis AG&#x27;s animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans. As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment was divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) treatment market.

In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercializing Hanmi&#x27;s phase I Bruton&#x27;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal that could yield $690 million. A day later, however, the company announced another deal with China&#x27;s Innovent Biologics to co-develop and commercialize at least three of Innovent&#x27;s treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million; the collaboration was subsequently expanded in 2022, according to Innovent. As part of the deal, the company contributed its c-Met monoclonal antibody, and Innovent contributed a monoclonal antibody, which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immunooncology molecule. The following week, the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company. 

In April 2015, Lilly engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California, a campus and facility that is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the U.S.

In January 2017, Elanco Animal Health, a subsidiary of the company completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim&#x27;s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio. 

In March 2017, Lilly acquired CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, obtaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan. In August 2017, Lilly and Shionogi jointly licensed their product varespladib to Ophirex for Ophirex&#x27;s novel snakebite treatment program.

In May 2018, Lilly acquired Armo Biosciences for $1.6 billion. Days later, the company announced it would acquire Aurora kinase A inhibitor developer AurKa Pharma, and control over the lead compound, AK-01, for up to $575 million.

In January 2019, Lilly announced it would acquire Loxo Oncology for $235 per share, valuing the business at around $8 billion,which significantly expanded the business&#x27;s oncology offerings. The deal gave Lilly Loxo&#x27;s oral TRK inhibitor, Vitrakvi (Larotrectinib), LOXO-292, an oral proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitor, LOXO-305, an oral Bruton&#x27;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, and LOXO-195, a follow-on TRK inhibitor. In August 2019, Elanco acquired the Bayer animal health business for $7.6 billion.

In January 2020, the company announced its acquisition of Dermira for $1.1 billion, gaining control of lebrikizumab,glycopyrronium cloth used in the treatment of hyperhidrosis, and other assets. 

In June 2020, Lilly announced that, in collaboration with Vancouver-based AbCellera, it had begun the world&#x27;s first study of a potential monoclonal antibody treatment for treatment of COVID-19, with a Phase 1 trial of LY-CoV555. By August 2020, the challenging aspects of running a clinical trial in a long-term care facility during a pandemic prompted Lilly to create the first of many customized recreational vehicles into mobile research units (MRU) to meet people where they were and support mobile labs and clinical trial material preparation. A trailer truck could escort the MRU with supplies to create an on-site infusion clinic. Lilly deployed the mobile research unit fleet in response to outbreaks of the virus at long-term care facilities across the U.S. In September 2020, Amgen announced that they had partnered with Lilly to manufacture their COVID-19 antibody therapies. 

In October 2020, Lilly announced that its cocktail was effective and that it had filed with the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for it. The same day, Lilly&#x27;s corporate rival Regeneron also filed for an EUA for its own monoclonal antibody treatment. The same month, Lilly announced it would acquire Disarm Therapeutics and its experimental treatments for axonal degeneration, via SARM1 inhibitors, for $135 million plus a further $1.225 billion based on regulatory and commercial milestones. 

Also in October 2020, Lilly announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ACTIV-3 clinical trial evaluating its monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab (LYCoV555), found that bamlanivimab was not effective in treating people hospitalized with COVID-19, but data showed bamlanivimab might be effective in treating COVID-19 by reducing viral load, symptoms, and the risk of hospitalization in outpatients. Other studies, including the NIH ACTIV-2 trial and its own BLAZE-1 trial, continued to evaluate bamlanivimab. In November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients. In December 2020, Lilly announced it would acquire Prevail Therapeutics Inc. for $1 billion, boosting its pipeline in neurodegenerative disease gene therapies.

In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed and signaled FDA agreement for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and certain pediatric patients. On 18 May 2021, the FDA accepted Lilly&#x27;s application for Tyvyt (sintilimab), in combination with Lilly&#x27;s own Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy for newly diagnosed nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. In July 2021, the company announced it would acquire Protomer Technologies for more than $1 billion.

In January 2022, distribution of Lilly&#x27;s COVID-19 antibody drug was paused due to lack of efficacy against the emerging omicron variant. A second COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy, bebtelovimab, developed with AbCellera, was granted Emergency Use Authorization in February 2022, with the U.S. government committing to a $720 million purchase of up to 600,000 doses. 

In May 2022, the FDA approved Lilly&#x27;s type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide). In August 2022, following the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in the &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision, the state of Indiana passed a near total ban on abortion, and Lilly said the move would make it difficult to attract talent to the state and that it would be forced to look for &quot;more employment growth&quot; elsewhere.

In October 2022, the business announced it would acquire Akouos Inc. for $487 million in upfront and $123 million deferred payments. 

In early 2020, Lilly introduced the Lilly Insulin Value Program, where people who have commercial insurance or no insurance can receive a savings card to fill their entire monthly prescription of any Lilly insulin for $35. In 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act extended a similar concept across all insulin suppliers by capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per monthly prescription among Medicare Parts B and D enrollees.

In January 2023, Lilly and TRexBio announced a collaboration and license agreement for three assets to treat immune-mediated diseases. TRexBio received an upfront payment of $55 million as part of this deal. In June the company announced it would acquire startup Emergence Therapeutics for an undisclosed sum and Sigilon Therapeutics for $300 million. The company&#x27;s 2023 research and development focus has been reported to be on drugs in the obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer&#x27;s and autoimmune areas. 

In July 2023, Lilly announced it would acquire Versanis for $1.93 billion. In October 2023, Eli Lilly acquired Point Biopharma for $1.4 billion.

In November 2023, the FDA approved tirzepatide for the treatment of obesity under the brand name Zepbound.

In March 2024, Lilly announced a deal with Amazon to offer home delivery of certain medications for diabetes, obesity, and migraines, on behalf of LillyDirect.

As of October 2024, tirzepatide&#x27;s success as a blockbuster weight-loss drug had transformed Eli Lilly into the most valuable drug company in the world with a $842 billion market capitalization, the highest valuation ever achieved by a drug company to date, followed only by Novo Nordisk.

==Collaborative research==
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886, Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist. Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts. 

After World War I, the company&#x27;s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly&#x27;s next crucial phase—its &quot;aggressive entry into scientific research and development.&quot; The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company&#x27;s collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere. Clowes&#x27;s first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company&#x27;s future. Lilly&#x27;s success with insulin production secured the company&#x27;s position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research. 

In 1934, the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis. As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital. Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market. 

In 1949, Eli Lilly went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve, setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA) Unit to allow employees to research company data for the scientific logistics and Eurasian fields of study. 

In 1998, the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.

===Publicly funded research===
Lilly is involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example is non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs. 

In 2008, this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. in Switzerland, secured an €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe. 

In 2008, Lilly&#x27;s activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.

==Pharmaceutical brands==
The company&#x27;s most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts. 

During World War II, Lilly produced penicillin and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included &quot;antimalarials,&quot; blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).

Among the company&#x27;s other pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company&#x27;s best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for the product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.

In March 2023, Eli Lilly announced a $35 cap on the price of monthly insulin to be put in place immediately in order to be in line with the Inflation Reduction Act.

Medications that provide significant revenue for Lilly include Trulicity, Mounjaro, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance, Humalog, Cyramza, Olumiant, Emgality, Tyvyt, Retevmo, Alimta, and Zepbound.

=== Cialis ===

In 2003, Eli Lilly and Company introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer&#x27;s blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the &quot;weekend pill&quot;. Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. In December 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.

=== Cymbalta ===
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.

=== Kisunla ===

Donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Kisunla was approved by the US FDA in 2024.

=== Gemzar ===

In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved gemcitabine (Gemzar) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

=== Methadone ===

Lilly was the first distributor of methadone in the United States, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions. Eli Lilly was able to acquire the right to produce the drug commercially for just $1 because the patent rights of the original patent holders, IG Farben and Farbwerke Hoechst, were not protected after the Allies of World War II seized all German patents, research records and trade names. Eli Lilly introduced the drug to the United States in 1947, marketed under the trade name &quot;Dolophine&quot;.

=== Prozac ===

Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. Prozac was approved by the US FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression, with generic versions appearing after 2002.

=== Secobarbital ===

Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 1999.

Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. In September 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. In June 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.

=== Thiomersal ===

Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that &quot;had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship.&quot; In November 2002, congressional Republicans inserted a provision into a domestic security bill that President George W. Bush signed into a law, protecting Eli Lilly from all suits in the federal courts, alleging that the drug, Thiomersal caused autism and other neurological disorders in children, such that all such matters be heard by a special master appointed for the purpose, rather than regular federal courts. Its toxicology was that it metabolized into ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate, in the body. However, since the mid 2000’s it has mostly fallen out of use.

=== Zyprexa ===

Zyprexa (Olanzapine) (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, (see Illegal marketing of Zyprexa) it was the company&#x27;s best selling drug through 2010, when the patent expired.

==Leadership==
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership. The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company&#x27;s president.

Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley&#x27;s appointment began the transition to non-family management. In 1972 Richard Donald Wood became Lilly&#x27;s president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck. In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and CEO and Wood became board chairman. During Bryson&#x27;s 20-month tenure as Lilly&#x27;s president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.

Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&amp;T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company&#x27;s executive ranks first to replace Lilly&#x27;s president and CEO, Vaughn Bryson, at Bryson&#x27;s predecessor and then board chairman Richard Wood&#x27;s urging and then, in short order, also Wood. Tobias later became the US director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.

Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999. Taurel retired as CEO in March 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until 31 December 2008. John C. Lechleiter was elected as Lilly&#x27;s CEO and president, effective 1 April 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly&#x27;s president and chief operating officer since October 2005.

In July 2016 it was announced that Lechleiter would be retiring. David Ricks was voted to succeed his position.

===Community service===
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades. Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way. Josiah&#x27;s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.

Josiah Sr. continued his father&#x27;s civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.

In 1917, Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah&#x27;s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919. Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion. In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war&#x27;s end.

===Lilly Endowment===

In 1937, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock. The endowment still owns 11.3% of the company.

===Eli Lilly and Company Foundation===
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly&#x27;s corporate profits.

== Controversies ==
=== BGH ===

In August 2008, Eli Lilly purchased the right to manufacture bovine growth hormone, used to increase milk production in dairy cattle, from Monsanto. Use of the supplement has become controversial due to the animal ethics and human health concerns.

=== 340B ===

In 2021, Eli Lilly filed a court motion against in response to an advisory opinion of the Department of Health and Human Services indicating that Eli Lilly and other drug manufacturers must continue to offer reduced pricing to covered outpatient drugs through pharmacies contracted to hospitals rather than only to the hospitals themselves.

=== Prozac ===
In September 1989, Joseph T. Wesbecker killed eight people and injured twelve before committing suicide. His relatives and victims blamed his actions on the Prozac medication he had begun taking a month prior. The incident set off a chain of lawsuits and public outcries. Lawyers began using Prozac to justify the abnormal behaviors of their clients. Eli Lilly was accused of not doing enough to warn patients and doctors about the adverse effects, which it had described as &quot;activation&quot;, years prior to the incident. The link between suicide and antidepressants remains a subject of public and academic dispute.

In October 2004, the FDA added a boxed warning to all antidepressant drugs regarding use in children. In 2006, the FDA included adults aged 25 or younger. In February 2018, the FDA ordered an update to the warnings based on statistical evidence from twenty-four trials in which the risk of such events increased from two percent to four percent relative to the placebo trials.

=== Illegal marketing of Zyprexa ===
Eli Lilly has faced many lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking olanzapine (branded Zyprexa), an antipsychotic medication, as well as by various governmental entities, insurance companies, and others. Internal documents provided to &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that Lilly had downplayed the risks of Zyprexa. According to the documents, 16 percent of people taking Zyprexa gained more than 66 pounds in their first year, a much larger figure than Eli Lilly had shared with doctors.

In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle around 8,000 of these lawsuits, and in early 2007, Lilly settled around 18,000 suits for $500 million, which brought the total Lilly had paid to settle suits related to the drug to $1.2 billion.

In March 2008, Lilly settled a suit with the state of Alaska, and in October 2008, Lilly agreed to pay $62 million to 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle suits brought under state consumer protection laws. In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate &quot;qui tam&quot; lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to a US federal criminal misdemeanor charge of illegally marketing Zyprexa, actively promoting the drug for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement, a $515 million criminal fine, and forfeit assets of $100 million. The US Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a US criminal prosecution of any kind. &quot;That was a blemish for us,&quot; John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, said. &quot;We don&#x27;t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that.&quot; In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated &quot;we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population&quot; for off-label use.

In January 2020, lawyer James Gottstein published a book titled &quot;The Zyprexa Papers&quot; summarizing the legal activities surrounding Zyprexa, and their impact on the political landscape of psychiatry and antipsychiatry in the US. The book details of how he obtained the Zyprexa papers, including how Will Hall and a small group of &quot;psychiatric survivors&quot; untraceably spread the Zyprexa Papers on the Internet and his battles on behalf of Bill Bigley, the psychiatric patient whose ordeal made possible the exposure of the Zyprexa Papers.

=== Discrimination ===
In March 2021, Eli Lilly and Company was accused of sex discrimination by a former lobbyist who claimed she was forced to work in a sexually hostile work environment. The parties involved settled for an undisclosed amount in June 2021.

In September 2021, Eli Lilly and Company was accused in a federal court lawsuit of discriminating against older applicants for sales positions based on their implementation of hiring quotas for millennials.

=== Canada patent lawsuit ===
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for Strattera and Zyprexa. Canadian courts found Strattera&#x27;s seven-week long study of twenty-two patients, too short and too narrow in scope to qualify for the patent. The Zyprexa patent was invalidated because it had not achieved its promised utility. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost profits. They ultimately lost the case in 2017.

=== Illegal marketing of Evista ===
Evista is a medication typically used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

In December 2005, Eli Lilly and Company agreed to plead guilty and pay $36 million in connection with the illegal promotion of the drug. Sales representatives were trained to promote Evista for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, to prompt or bait questions by doctors, and to send them unsolicited letters promoting Evista for unapproved use. The company distributed a videotape in which a sales representative declared that &quot;Evista truly is the best drug for the prevention of all these diseases.&quot; Some sales representatives had also been instructed to conceal the disclosure page which stated that the effectiveness of the drug in reducing breast cancer risks had not yet been established.

=== Insulin pricing ===
In January 2019, lawmakers from the United States House of Representatives sent letters to Eli Lilly and other insulin manufacturers asking for explanations for their rapidly raising insulin prices. The annual cost of insulin for people with type 1 diabetes in the US almost doubled from $2,900 to $5,700 over the period from 2012 to 2016.

Renewed attention was brought to Eli Lilly&#x27;s pricing of insulin in November 2022, after a verified Twitter account impersonating Eli Lilly posted on Twitter that insulin would now be free. The following year, the company announced that it would be reducing the out-of-pocket price of insulin to $35 a month. The company also stated that it would lower the price of Humalog from $275 a month to $66 and that it would offer insulin glargine at a 78% discount compared to rival company Sanofi. Despite this, the reduced costs will not apply to Eli Lilly&#x27;s newer brands of insulin, and the company&#x27;s pricing is still significantly higher than it was several decades prior.

<text>Richard Clay &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton (born February 14, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player and current basketball analyst for CBS Sports HQ. Hamilton played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is best known for his nine-year stint with the Detroit Pistons, where he was a three-time All-Star. He helped lead the Pistons to six straight Eastern Conference Finals appearances, back to back NBA Finals appearances, their best record in franchise history (64–18 in 2005–06) and the 2004 NBA championship.

Born and raised in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, a city west of Philadelphia, Hamilton played three years for the University of Connecticut. In his third and final year, Hamilton was named the Final Four&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player en route to an upset NCAA Championship win over the favored Duke Blue Devils. He is the second-leading scorer in Connecticut Huskies history.

Named a consensus first-team All-American, Hamilton decided to forgo his senior year and enter the NBA draft. Drafted seventh overall by the Washington Wizards where he would spend the next three seasons, Hamilton notably averaged 20 points per game starting next to Michael Jordan. Traded to Detroit for Jerry Stackhouse in 2002, Hamilton played with the Pistons for nine seasons before ending his career with two final seasons with the Chicago Bulls. The Pistons retired his No. 32 jersey on February 26, 2017.

==College career==
Hamilton played college basketball at the University of Connecticut from 1996 to 1999. In a 1998 Sweet 16 game with the 2-seeded UConn vs the 11th-seeded Washington Huskies, Hamilton hit a game-winning shot as time ran out after rebounding a missed shot by Jake Voskuhl and then his own shot attempt. He was named the 1999 NCAA tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player after UConn&#x27;s run to that year&#x27;s national title after averaging 24.2 points per game. Number 1 UConn&#x27;s race to the top also included a close, physical defeat of the national Cinderella team no. 10 Gonzaga Bulldogs, in which Hamilton played a key role as UConn&#x27;s leading scorer in the game. The UConn squad beat a Duke team in the final game after which four Duke players were drafted in the top 14 of the 1999 NBA draft. The Huskies were nine-point underdogs, but upset the Blue Devils after Hamilton contributed 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in the final game. The &quot;One Shining Moment&quot; video and song had one of Hamilton&#x27;s shots against Duke as the last shot shown in the video.

==Professional career==
Hamilton was selected with the 7th pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Washington Wizards. In his first career game, Hamilton recorded 10 points in almost 16 minutes of playing time on a 94–87 win over the visiting Atlanta Hawks. On November 12, Hamilton recorded 13 points and a career-high 8 rebounds on a 104–95 loss to the Miami Heat. In his rookie season, he played in 71 games with 12 starts and averaged 9 points a game backing up veteran shooting guard Mitch Richmond. The Wizards won 29 games, however, and failed to make the playoffs.

In the following year, Hamilton played more at the small forward position and started in 42 of 78 games and doubled his scoring average to 18.1 points a game. On November 8, 2000, Hamilton recorded a career-high 30 points, 3 rebounds and 3 steals in a 102–86 home loss to the New Jersey Nets. The Wizards did not improve, however, winning only 19 games for the season. In the off-season, Michael Jordan announced that he would return to the court for the Wizards, and Doug Collins was hired to coach the team.

With Jordan now the team&#x27;s small forward, Hamilton moved back to shooting guard and assumed the starting role. Hamilton and Jordan were limited to 60 games due to injuries, but the duo helped improve the team&#x27;s final record to 37–45, effectively an 18-game improvement over the previous season. Though they missed the playoffs, Hamilton averaged 20 points a game for the season while finishing second in the league in free throw percentage, shooting 89 percent from the free throw line.

===Detroit Pistons (2002–2011)===

In September, the Wizards traded Hamilton to the Detroit Pistons, along with Bobby Simmons and Hubert Davis, in exchange for Ratko Varda, Brian Cardinal, and All-Star scorer Jerry Stackhouse. During the 2002 off-season, the Pistons also traded for Chauncey Billups and drafted forward Tayshaun Prince. The Pistons already featured reigning Coach of the Year Rick Carlisle and Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace.

In his first career game with the Pistons, Hamilton recorded 22 points and 6 rebounds in an 86–77 win over the visiting New York Knicks.

Hamilton started all 82 games for Detroit and led the team in scoring with 19.7 points per game as the team won 50 games and the Central Division. In Hamilton&#x27;s playoff series debut, he helped rally the team from a 3–1 deficit against Tracy McGrady and the Orlando Magic, to win the series in seven games. They defeated Philadelphia 76ers in the conference semifinals and returned to the Conference Finals for the first time since 1991. They faced the defending conference-champion New Jersey Nets, who overwhelmed the Pistons with their experience and swept the series in four games. Hamilton led Detroit in scoring throughout the playoffs with 22.5 points per game on 44 percent shooting.

====Championship win and return to the Finals: 2004–2005====
Through the early part of the 2003–04 season, Hamilton broke his nose twice (he also broke it in 2002) and was advised to wear a face mask to prevent needing significant nasal reconstructive surgery. The clear plastic face mask became his trademark and he would wear it for the rest of his playing career. The season also marked the arrival of All-Star forward Rasheed Wallace who teamed with Hamilton, Billups, Ben Wallace, and Prince under new head coach Larry Brown to lay the foundation of what would become known as the &quot;Goin&#x27; to Work&quot; Pistons.

Now wearing the mask on a nightly basis (he called the mask his &quot;Superman cape&quot;), Hamilton led the Pistons in scoring for the second consecutive season with 17.6 points per game as the Pistons finished the season with 54 wins. Hamilton scored a then career-high 44 points on 15-for-23 shooting from the field as the Pistons won 92–88 at home against the Cavaliers.

In the playoffs, the Pistons dominated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round before setting up a rematch with New Jersey. In a back-and-forth seven-game series against the Nets, Hamilton scored 21 points and grabbed 6 rebounds in the decisive Game 7 victory, as the Pistons came back from a 3–2 deficit. The Pistons then faced the league-leading Indiana Pacers in the conference finals, and the team&#x27;s defense and efficient scoring proved too much for the favored Pacers. Hamilton scored 33 points in an 83–65 Game 5 victory in Indiana, and Detroit wrapped up the series in the following game 69–65 at home to advance to the franchise&#x27;s first NBA Finals since the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; Pistons team won the NBA title in 1990. Hamilton contributed 21 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in that Game 6 win over the Pacers.
The Pistons were viewed as a major underdog in the Finals, as they faced the star-studded Los Angeles Lakers, who were just one season removed from winning three straight championships. Adding a new chapter to the Lakers–Pistons rivalry of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Pistons dominated game 1 in Los Angeles and shocked the Lakers 87–75. The Lakers bounced back in game 2 with an overtime win to send the series to Detroit tied at 1–1. Through the three games in Detroit, the Pistons&#x27; defense and efficient scoring dismantled Los Angeles to win the championship in five games. Hamilton led the Pistons with 21.4 points per game in the Finals, and scored 31 points in their 88–68 Game 3 win.

Entering the season determined to repeat as champions, Hamilton led the team in scoring for the third consecutive season, averaging 18.7 points per game. On January 6, 2005, Hamilton was 0-for-10 from the field, but hit 14-of-14 free throws to pace the Pistons in a 101–79 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, becoming the only player in NBA history to lead his team in scoring in a game despite not making a single field goal.

As the second seed in the playoffs, Detroit defeated Philadelphia before another rematch with Indiana. In a match-up overshadowed by the brawl between the two teams earlier in the season, the champs overcame a 2–1 series deficit with Hamilton scoring 28 points in the decisive game six victory. In the conference finals against the Miami Heat led by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who had arrived via trade from Los Angeles, and Dwyane Wade, the Pistons responded to a 3–2 deficit with two straight victories and advanced to the NBA Finals for a second consecutive year. Hamilton scored 24 in game 7.

Detroit faced the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals, led by all-stars such as Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginóbili. The Spurs won the first two games of the series, before the Pistons responded with two wins of their own before the Spurs took a 3–2 lead after a win in Detroit in the fifth game. Detroit responded on the road in game 6, with Hamilton scoring 23 points. The Spurs proved too much in game 7, however, winning the game and the series. Hamilton averaged 20 points throughout the 2005 playoffs.

====Three All-Star selections: 2006–2008====

The 2005–06 season would prove to be another great one individually for Hamilton, as he averaged a career-high 20.1 points a game and earned his first All-Star Game selection. He also led the league in three-point field goal percentage with .458, as the Pistons excelled throughout the season and won a franchise-record 64 games. Detroit once again ran through the first round of the playoffs, against Milwaukee, with Hamilton scoring 40 points in the series-clinching fifth game. Up next were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were led by forward LeBron James. The series reached seven games before the Pistons put away the younger Cavaliers. This set up a rematch with Miami, and while the Pistons had home court advantage they had no answer for the dominant play of Dwyane Wade, and lost in six games. Hamilton scored 33 points in game 6 and averaged 20.4 points in the 2006 Playoffs. Miami advanced to the Finals and won the NBA title. After the season, Ben Wallace signed with the Chicago Bulls, changing the dynamic of the Pistons&#x27; identity.

During the 2006–07 season, on December 27, Hamilton scored a career-high 51 points with 19-for-37 field goal shooting in a 151–145 triple-overtime Pistons loss to the New York Knicks, becoming the first opposing player since Michael Jordan to score over 50 points at Madison Square Garden. Hamilton averaged 19.8 points during the season and was once again selected to represent the Eastern Conference at the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. The Pistons won 53 games, and swept the Orlando Magic in the first round of the playoffs before defeating Chicago and Wallace in the conference semifinals. This set up a rematch with the younger Cleveland Cavaliers team, but this time the Cavaliers peaked after the series tied at 2–2, and won the next two games to win the series. Hamilton averaged 18.8 points throughout the 2007 playoffs.

With back-to-back losses in the conference finals and the rise of teams such as the Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, and Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons entered the 2007–08 season in unfamiliar territory. They were however able to win 59 games and still secure the Central Division title. Hamilton averaged 17.3 points a game for Detroit, and was selected as an All-Star for the third straight year. He also participated in the Foot Locker Three-Point Shootout.

The Pistons defeated Philadelphia in the first round before holding off the young Orlando Magic led by Dwight Howard, with Hamilton scoring 32 points in the 5th game and 31 points in the 6th game, as he surpassed Isiah Thomas as the Pistons&#x27; all-time leading scorer in the playoffs. Detroit advanced to their sixth straight appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals, but fell to the Boston Celtics in six games. After the loss, Joe Dumars acknowledged it was probably the end of an era, signaling the team&#x27;s impending changes. Indeed, changes began immediately when Flip Saunders was dismissed as head coach, despite the best winning percentage in Pistons history.

====Playing without Billups: 2008–2011====

Just two games into the 2008–09 season, Detroit traded Hamilton&#x27;s longtime backcourt mate Chauncey Billups in exchange for former MVP Allen Iverson. Despite expressing his disappointment with the trade, Hamilton agreed to a three-year, $34 million contract extension to remain in Detroit. Hamilton averaged 18.3 points per game during the season, including a 38-point effort as a reserve in an overtime game against Milwaukee, the most by a Piston reserve in history. He also posted a career-high 16 assists on March 13 against the Toronto Raptors. However, the backcourt rotation of Hamilton, Iverson, Will Bynum, and Rodney Stuckey failed to mesh well under coach Michael Curry, and Detroit posted their first losing record with Hamilton on the team. They still qualified for the 8th seed in the playoffs, but they were swept by Cleveland in the first round. After the season, Iverson and Rasheed Wallace departed the team.

Hamilton played in 46 games in the 2009–10 season and averaged 18.1 points a game. Detroit won 27 games that year, despite the return of Ben Wallace and the addition of younger players. The following year, Hamilton feuded frequently with then-head hoach John Kuester, including verbally berating Kuester in front of the team during a practice.
This feud led to Kuester&#x27;s benching of Hamilton. In more than six weeks, Hamilton only played 20 total minutes and received a DNP-CD (did not play – coach&#x27;s decision), where he was on the active roster but did not play in 23 out of 24 games. Despite Kuester&#x27;s firing by the Pistons after the 2010–11 season, Hamilton&#x27;s contract was bought out by the Pistons in December 2011, making him an unrestricted free agent.

===Chicago Bulls (2011–2013)===
Hamilton cleared waivers on December 14, 2011, and quickly signed a three-year, $15 million contract with the Chicago Bulls, with the third year being a team option. During the 2011–12 season, he averaged 11.6 points per game, 3 rebounds per game, and 2.4 assists per game in 24.9 minutes per game. Due to injuries, he only played 28 games (starting all of them). The Bulls finished 50–16, clinching the first playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the team lost All-Star Derrick Rose to a torn ACL in the first game of the playoffs and were defeated in six games by the eighth-seeded Philadelphia 76ers.

In the 2012–13 season, Hamilton averaged 9.8 points per game, 2.4 assists per game, and 1.7 rebounds per game in 21.8 minutes per game. He played 50 games, starting in 45 of them. On November 26, 2012, Hamilton scored a season-high 30 points, but missed a shot as time expired that would have won the game, in a 93–92 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bulls finished 45–37; they ranked 5th in the Eastern Conference and 2nd in the Central Division. The team reached the second round of the playoffs, but were eliminated by the Miami Heat. The Bulls declined their option on Hamilton&#x27;s contract on July 10, 2013, making him a free agent.

On February 26, 2015, Hamilton officially announced his retirement from the NBA on the ESPN program &quot;His &amp; Hers&quot;. This was just months after he sustained a &quot;freak&quot; foot injury in October 2014, which ultimately convinced him to retire from the game.

On February 26, 2017, the Pistons retired Hamilton&#x27;s no. 32 jersey.

==Media appearances==
In the 2006–07 NBA season Hamilton appeared in the &quot;NBA Fundamentals&quot; series, hosted by TNT, where basketball players showcase certain aspects of the game. Hamilton explained the topic &quot;moving without the ball&quot; to shake off your defender.

He was also a contestant on an episode of the game show series &quot;Wanna Bet?&quot;.

He has worked with many charities, including the Read to Achieve program and reading books to children. As part of his long-time work with children, he has appeared on an episode of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Imagination Movers&quot;. He helped the gang play basketball and learn a lesson of friendship.

==Personal life==
On October 31, 2007, Hamilton&#x27;s girlfriend, former So Plush member T. J. Lottie gave birth to Richard Clay Hamilton II. On July 11, 2009, Hamilton married Lottie in Boca Raton, Florida. Special guests included Dwyane Wade, Rasheed Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Michael Jordan, and many others.

In April 2009, Hamilton filed a suit against former personal assistant and business manager Josh Nochimson, claiming that Nochimson stole over $1 million by unauthorized use of Hamilton&#x27;s credit card from 2003 to 2008.

He inherited the nickname &quot;Rip&quot; from his father who received it from his mother due to the elder&#x27;s habit of ripping his diaper off as an infant.

<text>Paul G. Comba (1926 – April 5, 2017) was an Italian-American computer scientist, an amateur astronomer and a prolific discoverer of minor planets.

He was born in Tunisia to Italian parents in 1926, and moved to Italy at a young age. Admitted to university studies at the age of 17, He attended the University of Turin (1943–46). In 1946 he moved to the United States to attend Bluffton College, from which he graduated in 1947. He then attended Caltech, and completed his Ph.D. work in mathematics in 1951 (the degree was conferred at commencement in 1952). In 1951 he moved to Honolulu where he taught at the University of Hawaii until 1960.

He then joined IBM as a software developer, and later as a member of the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center. There he worked in Cryptography, and also developed a multiplication algorithm for large numbers, which reduces the multiplication time to as little as 3% of the conventional algorithm.

In 2003 he won the Leslie C. Peltier Award for his contribution to astronomy.

He is the author of the Astronomical League&#x27;s Asteroid Club Observing Guide, and was an active member of the Prescott Astronomy Club.

==Prescott Observatory==
After retirement in 1991, Comba moved to Prescott, Arizona, where he built the Prescott Observatory (obs. code: 684) There he specialized in discovering asteroids and has been recognized for the discovery of 644 numbered objects as of September 2013.

Refurbished in 2011, the observatory houses a PlaneWave CDK 24 inch telescope with two Takahashi wide field refractors in the dome. There is a dedicated solar observatory that is equipped with a Lunt 152 solar telescope. The observatory also has a nano lab for cosmology research that is currently equipped with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (scanning electron microscope). Prescott Observatory is an active contributor for the webcast organization SLOOH which is the premiere webcast organization for live celestial events. The observatory is now owned and operated by Matt Francis.
