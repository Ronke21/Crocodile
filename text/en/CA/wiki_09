<text>James Henry O&#x27;Rourke (September 1, 1850 – January 8, 1919), nicknamed &quot;Orator Jim&quot;, was an American professional baseball player in the National Association and Major League Baseball who played primarily as a left fielder. For the period 1876–1892, he ranks behind only Cap Anson in career major league games played (1,644), hits (2,146), at-bats (6,884), doubles (392) and total bases (2,936), and behind only Harry Stovey in runs scored (1,370) (Stovey was a younger player; Anson played five seasons and O&#x27;Rourke four prior to 1876.). In 1945, O&#x27;Rourke was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
O&#x27;Rourke was born in East Bridgeport, Connecticut, and worked on his family&#x27;s farm while playing youth league and semi-pro baseball. He began his professional career as a member of the Middletown Mansfields in 1872, joining the one-year-old National Association team as a catcher. The Mansfields were not a top-tier team, and folded in August, but O&#x27;Rourke had impressed other teams sufficiently enough to be offered a contract with the Boston Red Stockings, with whom he played until 1878. On April 22, 1876, O&#x27;Rourke had the first base hit in National League history.

He graduated from Yale Law School in 1887 with an LL.B., practicing law in Bridgeport between early playing stints, and earning the nickname &quot;Orator Jim&quot; because of his verbosity on the field, his intellect, and his law degree—uncommon in a game regarded as a rough immigrant sport at the time.

After leaving the major leagues following the 1893 season he continued to play in the minor leagues until he was over 50 years old. Returning to the Park City fulltime, O’Rourke helped organize the Connecticut State League in 1895, serving as league official, team owner, manager, and player. As a direct result Bridgeport retained a professional baseball team for over a third of a century. Proximity to Yale allowed Jim to umpire Ivy League ball games and he also devoted his expertise to consulting baseball hierarchy at the national level. Jim is credited with signing Harry Herbert in 1895, Bridgeport’s first African American to play pro ball.

In 1904, he made a final appearance with the New York Giants under manager and friend John McGraw, becoming at age 54 the oldest player ever to appear in the National League, and the oldest player to hit safely in a major league game. O&#x27;Rourke is one of only 29 players in baseball history to appear in Major League games in four decades.

In 1912, he returned to the field to catch a complete minor league game at the age of 60.

O&#x27;Rourke died of pneumonia at age 68 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as one of the earliest inductees from the 19th century. His older brother John O&#x27;Rourke and his son Jimmy O&#x27;Rourke also played in the majors.

One legend concerning O&#x27;Rourke is that he was asked to drop the &quot;O&#x27;&quot; from his last name when he signed a contract with Boston and its Protestant backers. The son of Irish immigrants and the husband of a woman born in Ireland, O&#x27;Rourke refused, saying &quot;I would rather die than give up my father&#x27;s name. A million dollars would not tempt me.&quot;

Another legend about O&#x27;Rourke is that his signing by the Mansfields in 1872 was conditioned on the team finding someone to take over O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s chores on his parents&#x27; farm.

==Career statistics==
In 1,999 games over 23 seasons, O&#x27;Rourke posted a .310 batting average (2,639-for-8,503) with 1,729 runs, 468 doubles, 149 triples, 62 home runs, 1,208 RBI, 229 stolen bases, 513 bases on balls, .352 on-base percentage and .422 slugging percentage.

<text>James Lawrence Orr (May 12, 1822May 5, 1873) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the 22nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1857 to 1859. He also served as the 73rd governor of South Carolina from 1865 to 1868 after a term in the Confederate States Senate.

==Biography==
Orr was born at Craytonville, South Carolina. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1841 and became an attorney. In 1843 he married Mary Jane Marshall; they had seven children. He served as a Democratic Congressman from South Carolina from 1849 to 1859, serving as the Speaker of the House from 1857 to 1859. Orr was an advocate of states&#x27; rights who used his position to assist those persons who promoted the continuation of slavery. He foresaw the consequences of the decision by South Carolina to attempt to secede from the Union, but he remained loyal to his state, while protecting his own financial interests. Orr owned at least fourteen enslaved people in 1850 and purchased at least five more before 1860. He was one of the three commissioners sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the transfer of federal property to South Carolina; the failure of these negotiations led directly to the bombardment of one of the highest-profile federal assets within South Carolina, Fort Sumter.

Orr served as president of the 1860 South Carolina Democratic convention, which endorsed him for the Democratic presidential nomination.

After Fort Sumter and the outbreak of the American Civil War, Orr organized and commanded Orr&#x27;s Regiment of South Carolina Rifles, which saw little action before he resigned in 1862 and entered the Confederate Senate, where he served as chairman of the influential Foreign Affairs and Rules committees. The regiment continued to bear his name throughout the war and fought in some of the most prominent battles of the Army of Northern Virginia. In the Confederate Senate, he remained a strong proponent of states&#x27; rights.

At the end of the war, Orr was elected governor and served from 1865 until the passage of a new state constitution in 1868. In 1872 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Orr as Minister to Russia in a gesture of post-Civil War reconciliation. Orr died in St. Petersburg, Russia shortly after arriving to begin his service as Minister. He was interred in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Anderson, South Carolina.

A posthumous portrait of Orr by painter Esther Edmonds is currently part of the collection of the United States Capitol. The portrait was removed from public display in the Speaker&#x27;s Lobby outside the House Chamber after an order issued by the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi on June 18, 2020.

<doc id="759222" wikidata="Q5870702" url="?curid=759222" title="History of the West Indies cricket team">
<text>The history of the West Indian cricket team begins in the 1880s when the first combined West Indian team was formed and toured Canada and the United States. In the 1890s, the first representative sides were selected to play visiting English sides. Administered by the West Indies Cricket Board (&quot;WICB&quot;), and known colloquially as The Windies, the West Indies cricket team represents a sporting confederation of English-speaking Caribbean countries.

The WICB joined the sport&#x27;s international ruling body, the Imperial Cricket Conference, in 1926, and played their first official international match, which in cricket is called a Test, in 1928. Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test nation, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s, by which time the side had changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side. By the late 1970s, the West Indies had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a title they retained throughout the 1980s. Their team from the 1970s and 1980s is now widely regarded as having been one of the best in test cricket&#x27;s history, alongside Don Bradman&#x27;s Invincibles. During these glory years, the Windies were noted for their four-man fast bowling attack, backed up by some of the best batsmen in the world. The 1980s saw them set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 tests without defeat (the other tests being draws), as well as inflicting two 5–0 &quot;blackwashes&quot; against the old enemy of England. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, in part due to the rise in popularity of athletics and football in West Indian countries, and the team today is struggling to regain its past glory. However, the team has since won the ICC T20 World Cup twice (2012 and 2016, when it was styled World Twenty20), the ICC Champions Trophy once (2004), and the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup once (2016).

In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies of the West Indies Federation plus British Guyana. The current side represents the now independent states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago, and the British dependencies of Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands along with the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Maarten. National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian first-class competition, the Stanford 20/20, the Carib Beer Cup (earlier known as the &quot;Busta Cup&quot;, &quot;Shell Shield&quot; and various other names). It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm-up games before they take on the combined West Indies team.

==Early Years and Formation (1890s–1928)==

=== 1890s–1910s: Introduction and early cricketing culture ===
British colonists introduced cricket to the Caribbean in the 19th century, and it soon became embedded in the social and cultural fabric of the islands. British settlers and soldiers initially played the sport. Still, it gradually gained popularity among the local population, particularly as the Caribbean elite—many of whom had been educated in England—adopted the game as part of their lifestyle. By the late 19th century, cricket was widely played across the region, from Jamaica in the north to Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados in the south.

Cricket in the Caribbean islands grew organically, with each island developing its cricket culture. Friendly matches between local clubs became increasingly common, and by the late 19th century, matches between islands were regularly organised, fostering early rivalries and competition. Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana (then British Guiana), and Jamaica were some of the first islands to develop a structured cricketing framework.

In 1891, the first Inter-Colonial Tournament was organised. It became an annual event and played a key role in fostering regional competition and cohesion. The tournament included teams from Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana and eventually expanded to include other islands. This tournament was instrumental in improving the standard of cricket in the region, as it allowed players from different islands to compete against each other regularly.

During this period, several talented Caribbean players emerged, many of whom impressed during regional tournaments and drew the attention of international observers. However, despite this growing talent, the West Indies team was still far from achieving Test status, as the sport was still heavily controlled by the British establishment, which saw the Caribbean colonies primarily as sources of raw materials and labour rather than as equals in the cricketing world.

=== 1920s: Pre-Test era and team formation ===
The 1920s marked a turning point for West Indies cricket. As cricket became more popular across the region, there was a growing desire for a unified team to represent the West Indies internationally. Until now, matches against overseas teams have often been played by individual islands or representative teams that were informally selected. However, the region began to form a more cohesive cricketing identity, setting the stage for the emergence of a full-fledged West Indies cricket team.

In 1923, the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) was established, formalising cricket administration across the Caribbean islands. The formation of this governing body was a crucial step in the development of the West Indies cricket team, as it allowed the region to coordinate efforts in selecting and organising tours and lobby for recognition from the Imperial Cricket Conference, the governing body of international cricket at the time.

In the years leading up to their Test debut, the West Indies cricket team embarked on several international tours, gaining valuable experience and exposure to high-level competition. Notable tours included trips to England, where the West Indies played against county teams and English amateurs, and to Canada, where they participated in first-class matches. These tours allowed the West Indian players to hone their skills, learn from international cricketing cultures, and begin building a reputation for themselves on the global stage.

As the 1920s progressed, it became clear that the West Indies cricket team had the potential to compete at the highest levels of the game. With a growing pool of talented players and an increasing desire for recognition, the region began to push for full Test status.

In 1928, the West Indies cricket team reached a historic milestone when they were granted full Test status, becoming the fourth team to join the ranks of international Test cricket after England, Australia, and South Africa. This achievement reflected the region’s growing prowess in the sport and the influence of British colonialism, which had fostered the spread of cricket across the empire.

==The early Tests (1930s and 1940s)==

The West Indies played 19 Tests in the 1930s in four series against England and one against Australia. The first four of these were played against an England team led by the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe that toured in 1929–30. However, as Harold Gilligan was leading another English team to New Zealand at exactly the same time, this was not a full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being recorded on 26 February 1930. West Indian George Headley scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and Learie Constantine took the most wickets (18).

The West Indies toured Australia in 1930–31. They lost the Test series 4–1. The fifth and final Test showed some promise – batting first, the West Indies spent the first three days earning a 250-run lead with five wickets down in their second innings. A bold declaration was backed up by their bowlers, as Herman Griffith took four wickets and West Indies won by 30 runs to their first overseas Test victory. By the time the team left, they had left a good impression of themselves with the Australian public, although at first the team were faced with several cultural differences – for example, their hosts did not at first appreciate that the tourists&#x27; Roman Catholic beliefs would mean they would refuse to play golf on Sundays or engage in more ribald behaviour. The West Indian sides of the time were always led by white men, and the touring party to Australia comprised seven whites and eleven &quot;natives&quot;, and the West Indian Board of Control wrote to their Australian counterparts saying &quot;that all should reside at the same hotels&quot;. Australia at the time had in place its &quot;White Australia&quot; policy, with the Australian Board having to guarantee to the Government that the non-whites would leave at the end of the tour. When the West Indians arrived in Sydney, the whites were immediately given a different hotel from the blacks. They complained, and thereafter their wishes were met. The tour lost a lot of money, part of which was due to the Great Depression then affecting Australia. The West Indians won four and lost eight of their 14 first-class fixtures.

1933 saw another tour of England. Their hosts had just come back from defeating Australia in the infamous &quot;Bodyline&quot; series, where England&#x27;s aggressive bowling at the body with a legside field attracted much criticism. England won the three-Test series of three-day Tests against the Windies 2–0. The second, drawn, Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, provided an intriguing footnote to the Bodyline controversy when Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine bowled Bodyline – fast, short-pitched balls aimed at the body – against the Englishmen, the only time they faced it in international cricket. The tactic did not work, as Douglas Jardine, the English captain who ordered his players to bowl it against the Australians, did not flinch as he scored his only Test century, making 127 out of England&#x27;s 374.

Another England tour of the West Indies followed in 1934–35. England won the first Test in Barbados on a poor pitch, affected by rain, and in a match where 309 runs were scored, England took a four-wicket victory. Both sides declared one of their innings closed to have their bowlers take advantage of the poor pitch. The second Test saw the Windies win by 217 runs, and a drawn third Test saw the series go to a decider at Sabina Park in Jamaica. A massive 270 not out from George Headley saw the Windies declare on 535 for 7. Despite a century from Les Ames, England could not avoid going down by an innings and 161 runs – the West Indies had secured their first Test series victory.

The West Indies toured England in 1939. England won the first Test at Lord&#x27;s easily by 8 wickets, then there was a rain-affected draw in Manchester, and finally a high-scoring draw at the Oval in mid-August. The highlight of the series for the West Indies was George Headley scoring hundreds in both innings in the Lord&#x27;s Test. With the clouds of World War II seemingly about to envelope Europe, the rest of the tour was cancelled and the Windies returned home. They would play no more Tests until 21 January 1948 saw the start of the first Test the West Indies played since the War, which resulted in a draw against the MCC side from England. The second Test was also drawn, with George Carew and Andy Ganteaume both making centuries. Ganteaume was then dropped, ending with a Test average of 112 – the highest in Test history. The West Indies won the final two Tests chasing sub-100 totals, and wrapped up the series 2–0, their first away-series victory.

In 1948, West Indies toured newly independent India for the first time for a five Test tour. The tour was preceded by a non-Test tour of Pakistan and followed by a similar short tour of Ceylon. After three high-scoring draws against the Indians, the West Indians wrapped up the fourth by an innings before a thrilling fifth Test, which left the Indians six runs away from victory with two wickets in hand as time ran out, so that the West Indies thus won the rubber 1–0. Carrying on from his hundred in the series against England, Everton Weekes set a record of scoring hundreds in five successive Test innings.

==The post-War period (1950s)==
1950 saw another tour of England, the series saw the emergence for the West Indies of their great spinning duo, Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. England won the first Test by 202 runs, but Valentine and Ramadhin&#x27;s bowling would win the series for the visitors. The second Test saw the Windies put on 326 thanks to 106 from Allan Rae before Valentine (4 for 48) and Ramadhin (5 for 66) skittled England in the first innings. A mammoth 168 from Clyde Walcott saw England set a theoretical target of 601. Ramadhin&#x27;s 6 for 86 and Valentine&#x27;s 3 for 79 dismissed the hosts for 274. The spinning duo took 12 wickets, Frank Worrell made 261 and Everton Weekes 129 as the third Test went the Windies way by 10 wickets, the fourth saw 14 wickets from Valentine and Ramadhin and centuries from Rae and Worrell as England were defeated by an innings. The West Indies won the series 3–1.

In 1951–1952 the Windies visited Australia. The first Test saw a narrow defeat by three wickets, with the two spinners seemingly continuing their form with twelve wickets between them. The second Test was lost by seven wickets, as Australia replied to the Windies 362 and 290 with 567 (which included centuries from Lindsay Hassett and Keith Miller) and 137 for 2. 6 wickets from Worrell in the third Test saw Australia dismissed for only 82, and the Windies eventually won by six wickets to pull back to two-one down in the series. The fourth Test saw the series lost in a narrow defeat. Worrell, batting with an injured hand, scored 108 and helped the Windies to 272 before Australia made 216 in reply. 203 from the Windies left Australia a target of 260. 5 wickets from Valentine helped reduced the Aussies to 222 for 9, 38 short with 1 wicket remaining. It didn&#x27;t happen, as some brilliant running between the wicket for Australia by Bill Johnston and Doug Ring saw West Indies lose their composure and the match. The fifth Test saw three batting collapses, as Australia (116 and 377) beat Windies (78 and 213) by 202 runs to finish the rubber four-one winners. The West Indies then went on to New Zealand. In the first Test encounter between the two teams, the visitors scored a five wicket victory. In the second and final Test, Allan Rae scored 99, Jeffrey Stollmeyer 152, Frank Worrell 100 and Clyde Walcott 115 as the West Indies put on 546 for 6 declared. There wasn&#x27;t enough time to bowl out the opposition twice though, as the hosts made 160 and were following-on at 17 for 1 when stumps were drawn, leaving the Windies series winners.

The Indians toured at the beginning of 1953. The Windies won the second of the five Tests that were played, with the others all being draws. The highlight of these games we Frank Worrell&#x27;s 237 in the fifth Test, where all the three W&#x27;s scored hundreds, as the West Indies scored a 1–0 series victory. Len Hutton led an MCC (England) side to the islands in 1953–1954. Sonny Ramadhin again starred for the Windies taking 23 wickets (no other West Indian took more than 8), as Walcott&#x27;s 698 runs was more than 200 higher than second-placed West Indian, Everton Weekes. The five match rubber was drawn two-all.

Australia came and conquered in 1954–1955. After the Aussies made 515 in the first innings of the first Test, the Windies went down by 9 wickets. Then the Windies 382 was put in the shade by 600 for 9 declared by the visitors as the second Test was drawn. A low-scoring third Test saw Australia (257 and 133 for 2) beat the hosts (182 and 207) by 8 wickets. After Australia scored 668 in the fourth Test, the series was lost, although a double century from captain Denis Atkinson and a world-record stand for the seventh wicket allowed the Windies to reach 510 and draw the Test. The fifth Test saw the West Indies win the toss and bat. Walcott&#x27;s 155 was the highest score of their 357. The Australians then batted and batted, in total for 245.4 overs in the 6-day Test, as they put on 758 for 8 declared, with five players making centuries. 319 in the West Indies&#x27; second innings left them defeated by an innings and 82 runs in the Test, and by three games to nil in the series. Walcott set records by scoring five hundreds, and hundreds in both innings of a match twice. A four-Test tour of New Zealand followed in February 1956. After two wins by an innings and one by 9 wickets, the Windies were surprised by the Kiwis in the fourth, dismissing them for 145 and 77 as they recorded their first ever Test win in their 45th Test.

John Goddard returned to captain the West Indians for a five-Test tour of England in 1957, which was lost three-nil, with England having the better of the two draws. Then 1957–1958 Gerry Alexander led a team that defeated Pakistan three-one. It was in this series in Jamaica that Garry Sobers scored 365 not out to record what was then the highest score in Test match cricket. Alexander went on to lead the West Indies to a three-nil win over five Tests in India, and a 2–1 defeat by Pakistan in a three match rubber in the following winter. In 1959–1960 he led as West Indies went down one-nil at home in a five-match series with England.

==A period of mixed fortunes (1960s)==
Despite being a region where whites are a minority, until 1960 West Indies were always captained by white cricketers, though this was more social than racial discrimination. Throughout the 1950s, social theorist CLR James, the increasingly political former cricketer Learie Constantine and others called for a black captain. Constantine himself had stood in for Jackie Grant in the field against England on the 1934–35 tour, and George Headley captained the West Indies in the First Test against England in 1947–48 when the appointed, white captain, John Goddard was injured. However, no black was appointed as captain for a whole series until Frank Worrell was chosen to lead West Indies in their tour of Australia in 1960–61. In his three years as captain, Worrell moulded a bunch of talented but raw cricketers into probably the best team in the world.

In 1960, Australia were the best team in the world but on their way down, while West Indies were on their way up. It so happened that when they met, the two teams were of almost equal strength. The result was a series that has been recognised as one of the greatest of all time. The first Test in Brisbane was the first Test ever to end in a tie, which in cricket means the side batting last has been dismissed with scores level. The teams shared the next two Tests. In the fourth, Australia&#x27;s last pair of Ken Mackay and Lindsay Kline played out the last 100 minutes of the match to earn a draw, while Australia won the final Test and the series by two wickets. One of the days of play was attended by a world-record crowd of 90,800. Such was the impression created by Worrell&#x27;s team that the newly instituted trophy for the series between the two teams was named the Frank Worrell Trophy.

West Indies beat India 5–0 at home next year, and in 1963, they beat a fine English team by three matches to one. The Lord&#x27;s Test of this series saw a famous finish. With two balls left, England needed six runs to win, and West Indies one wicket. The non-striker was Colin Cowdrey, who had his left arm in a sling, having fractured it earlier in the day. However, David Allen safely played out the last two balls and the match ended in a draw. 

==World dominance (1970s)==
West Indies&#x27; woes overflowed into the 1970s. At home in 1970–71, they lost to India for the first time. In the next year, a five Test series against New Zealand cricket team ended with no team coming close to winning one. A major find in the New Zealand series was Lawrence Rowe, who started off with a double century and century on his debut. Under Rohan Kanhai&#x27;s captaincy, West Indies showed the first signs of revival. Australia won the closely fought 1972–73 series in the Caribbean by two Tests. With Sobers back – but Kanhai still the captain – West Indies defeated England 2–0 in 1973. This included a win by an innings and 226 runs at Lord&#x27;s, their biggest win against England. The return series in West Indies ended 1–1, though the home team was the better side. Rowe continued his run scoring three centuries including a 302 at Kingston. The final Test of this 1973–74 series marked the end of an era in West Indies cricket – it was the last Test of both Garry Sobers and Rohan Kanhai, and marked the emergence of fast bowler Andy Roberts.

The new captain Clive Lloyd had made his first appearance in Test cricket in 1966 and had since become a fixture in the side. His avuncular, bespectacled appearance and a stoop near the shoulders masked the fact that he was a very fine fielder, especially in the covers, and a devastating stroke player. Lloyd&#x27;s first assignment was the tour of India in 1974–75. West Indies won the first two Tests comfortably. Gordon Greenidge started his career with 107 and 93 in the first Test. Vivian Richards failed on his debut, but scored 192* in his second. India fought back to win the next two, but Lloyd hit 242* in the final Test to win the series.

West Indies won the inaugural World Cup in England in 1975, defeating Australia in the final. Then in 1975–76 they toured Australia, only to lose 1–5 in the six-Test series, and then beat India at home two-one in a four Test series later that same winter. It was in Australia that the quick bowler Michael Holding made his first appearance. Colin Croft and Joel Garner made their debuts the next year, and Malcolm Marshall two years after. In the span of about four years, West Indies brought together a bowling line-up of a quality that had rarely been seen before. The tour of India had seen the debut of Vivian Richards, arguably the finest West Indian batsman ever, and Gordon Greenidge, who joined a strong batting line-up that already included Alvin Kallicharran and opener Roy Fredericks in addition to Rowe and Lloyd. These players formed the nucleus of the side that became recognised as world Test match champions until the beginning of the 1990s.

Next came a tour of England in 1976. In a TV interview before the series, English captain Tony Greig commented that the West Indies tend to do badly under pressure and that &quot;we&#x27;ll make them grovel&quot;. This comment, especially as it came from a South African-born player, touched a raw nerve of the West Indians. Throughout the series, the English batsmen were subjected to what was described by the English press as very hostile bowling, but was rather reflective of a solid pace attack, and what the Windies had faced in Australia before. After the first two Tests ended in draws, West Indies won the next three. Of the many heroes for West Indies, Richards stood out with 829 runs in four Tests. He hit 232 at Trent Bridge and 291 at the Oval. Greenidge scored three hundreds, two of which were on the difficult wicket at Old Trafford. Roberts and Holding shared 55 wickets between them, Holding&#x27;s 8 for 92 and 6 for 57 on the unhelpful wicket at the Oval being a superlative effort.

West Indies won a home series against a tough Pakistan side in 1976–77. A few months later, the World Series Cricket (WSC) controversy broke out. Most of the West Indian players signed up with Kerry Packer, an Australian TV magnate who was attempting to set up his own international cricket competition. The Australian team that toured West Indies the next year included no Packer players. West Indies Cricket Board fielded a full-strength team under the argument that none of the West Indies players had refused to play, but disputes arose in the matter of payment and about the selection of certain players. Before the third Test, Lloyd resigned his captaincy. Within two days all the other WSC-contracted players also withdrew. Alvin Kallicharran captained the team for the remaining Tests of the series, which the Windies won 3–1.

WICB allowed the WSC players to appear in the 1979 World Cup, and the West Indies retained the title with little difficulty. By the end of 1979, the WSC disputes were resolved. Kallicharran was deposed after losing a six-match series one-nil in India and Lloyd returned as captain for a tour against a full-strength Australia (where the Windies won two-nil, with one draw) and New Zealand. The latter tour was full of controversy. New Zealand won the first Test at Dunedin by one wicket, but West Indies were never happy with the umpiring. West Indian discontent boiled over the next Test at Christchurch. While running into bowl, Colin Croft deliberately shouldered the umpire Fred Goodall. When Goodall went to talk to Lloyd about Croft&#x27;s behaviour, he had to walk all the way to meet the West Indian captain, as the latter did not move an inch from his position at the slips. After tea on the third day, West Indies refused to take the field unless Goodall was removed. They were persuaded to continue, and it took intense negotiations between the two boards to keep the tour on track. The Kiwis won the three match series after the second and third Tests ended in draws. Nevertheless, the defeat proved to be the West Indies last Test series loss for the next 15 years.

==Dominance, rebels and blackwashes (1980s)==
The 1980s started with a one-nil victory away to England over five Tests, one-nil away to Pakistan over four Tests, two-nil home to England over four Tests and a one-all draw away to Australia. Then in 1982–83, a West Indian rebel team toured apartheid South Africa. It was led by Lawrence Rowe and included prominent players like Alvin Kallicharran, Colin Croft, Collis King and Sylvester Clarke. WICB banned the players for life (which was later revoked), and some were refused entry back home. However, the rebels managed another tour the next year, which included most of the players of the original team. Despite this loss of talent, the official Windies side continued to dominate. During this time, the West Indies established themselves as one of Test cricket&#x27;s all-time great sides, peaking perhaps on their tour of England in 1984, where they won the series 5–0, the only time in Test cricket history the touring side has whitewashed a five-test series. This was followed by a second &quot;blackwash&quot; against England at home in 1985–86. At the same time, the West Indies established the then-record of 11 consecutive Test victories, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 Tests without defeat. In the period from 1980 to 1985–86 they won 10 out of 11 Test series, the 1981–82 series in Australia being drawn 1–1. The West Indies&#x27; only notable defeat in this period was in the one-day arena, when, to general surprise, they lost to India in the final of the 1983 World Cup.

West Indian captain Lloyd retired from Test cricket at the end of the 1984–85 series against Australia. In total Lloyd had captained West Indies in 74 Test matches, winning 36 of them. Vivian Richards was Lloyd&#x27;s successor, and continued the run of success. Meanwhile, a change of old guard was also happening. Joel Garner and Michael Holding had retired by 1987. A major find was Curtly Ambrose, who was as tall as Garner and equally effective with the ball. Courtney Walsh, who made his first appearance in 1984, bowled with an action that resembled Holding. Ian Bishop also had a similar action, and was as good a bowler till injuries interrupted his career. Patrick Patterson was faster than all the rest, but had a short career. Marshall still was the finest fast bowler in the world. But the batting was beginning to show signs of weakness, despite the presence of Richards, Greenidge and Desmond Haynes. West Indies failed to qualify for the semifinals of the 1987 World Cup. By the end of the 1980s, while still good were very beatable, they had lost the aura of invincibility that they had till the middle of the decade. Finding good replacements for senior players was again becoming a problem.

==Fall from grace (1990s–2000s)==
During the early 1990s, the West Indies team was dealt a great blow with the retirement of its star players like Richards, Greenidge, Dujon and Marshall (who all retired after the away series against England in 1991), bringing an end of an era of strength. This left a youthful and inexperienced side. After Richards&#x27; retirement the only players with significant experience were Richie Richardson (who was appointed the new captain of the side), Desmond Haynes (who was soon dropped), Gus Logie (who was recalled), Courtney Walsh (who was now the leader of the West Indian pace attack) and Roger Harper (who came and went). However, this did not immediately affect their performance. Richie Richardson proved to be a decent successor to Richards. A new crop of young players emerged such as Brian Lara, Curtly Ambrose, Ian Bishop, Jimmy Adams, Carl Hooper, Phil Simmons, Keith Arthurton and Winston Benjamin. It was five more years before the West Indies lost a series, but they had a number of close shaves before then. Making a comeback to international cricket, South Africa played its first Test match in Bridgetown, a match which was attended by fewer than 10,000 people because of a boycott. Needing 201 to win on the last day, South Africa reached 123 for 2 before Ambrose and Walsh took the remaining 8 wickets for 25 runs. In 1992–93, the West Indies defeated Australia by one run in Adelaide, where a loss would have cost them the series. In 1994–95, the West Indies salvaged a draw in India when, after losing the first Test and drawing the second, they secured a win in the third. In 1992, the West Indies once again failed to qualify for the World Cup semi-finals.

Australia finally defeated the West Indies 2–1 in 1994–95 to become the unofficial world champions of Test cricket. The 1996 World Cup ended with a defeat in the semi-final, which forced Richie Richardson to end his career. The captaincy passed over to Courtney Walsh and then in 1998 to Brian Lara. The West Indies made their first ever official tour to South Africa in 1998–99. It was a disaster, starting with player revolts and ending with a 5–0 defeat. The 1999 World Cup campaign ended in the group stages. The next year, England won a series against the West Indies for the first time in thirty-one years. The West Indies ended the decade with another 5–0 defeat, this time in Australia.

For most of the 1990s, the West Indian batting lineup was dominated by Brian Lara. Lara became a regular in the side after the retirement of Viv Richards in 1991. In 1993–94, he scored 375 against England in Antigua, breaking Sobers&#x27; world record for the highest individual score in Test cricket. He continued his fine form playing for Warwickshire in the 1994 English County Championship, posting seven first-class hundreds in eight innings (including the Test match 375). The last of these was 501 not out against Durham, which improved upon Hanif Mohammad&#x27;s thirty-five-year-old record as the highest score in first-class cricket. The West Indian bowling attack was spearheaded by Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, the latter setting a then world record of 519 wickets. However, these two had both retired by 2001, and their successors failed to maintain the high standards that Ambrose and Walsh had set. Despite the emergence of some good batsmen like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara remained the crucial figure of the side.

After a 2–0 defeat by New Zealand in 1999–00, Lara was replaced as captain by Jimmy Adams, who initially enjoyed series wins against Zimbabwe and Pakistan. However, a 3–1 defeat by England and a 5–0 whitewash by Australia saw him replaced by Carl Hooper for the 2000–01 visit by South Africa. By the time Lara was restored to the captaincy in 2002–03, series had been lost to South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, New Zealand and India. The only series win of note was against India (although Zimbabwe and Bangladesh were also beaten) as the West Indies plummeted to eighth place in the world-rankings, below all the other established Test nations.

After losing the first series of his second captaincy period to world champions Australia, Lara secured success against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, before another poor run saw 3–0 defeats in 4-Test series against both South Africa and England. In the drawn fourth Test against England, Lara became the only man to regain the world record for highest individual Test score by scoring 400 not out, once again in Antigua, bettering Matthew Hayden&#x27;s 380 against Zimbabwe the previous year. The West Indies were then whitewashed 4–0 in England. Lara&#x27;s last act as captain was to win the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, a one-day competition second only to the Cricket World Cup, at the Oval, London – a win that was a welcome surprise for the Caribbean which had just been hit by Hurricane Ivan.

===Player, Board disputes===
This joy was short-lived as a major dispute broke out in 2005 between the West Indian Players Association (WIPA) and the Cricket Board. The point of contention was clause 5 of the tour contract which gave WICB &quot;the sole and exclusive right to arrange for sponsorship, advertising, licensing, merchandising and promotional activities relating to WICB or any WICB Team&quot;. Digicel were the sponsors of the West Indian Team, while most of the players had contracts with Cable &amp; Wireless. This conflict, coupled with a payment dispute meant that the West Indies initially announced a team absent Lara and a number of other leading West Indians for South Africa&#x27;s visit in 2004–05, leading to Shivnarine Chanderpaul becoming captain. Some of these players did, in the end, compete. However, the dispute had not been resolved and rumbled on, leading to a second-string side being named for the tour of Sri Lanka in 2005. A resolution did not arise until October 2005, when a full-strength side was finally named for the 2005–06 tour of Australia. It was on this tour that Brian Lara overtook Australian Allan Border as the highest run-scorer in Test match cricket, despite the West Indies losing the series 3–0.

In 2009, another dispute erupted when many senior players decided not to take part over pay and contract issues. The WICB chose a second-string side to take part in a series against Bangladesh and the Champions Trophy. In 2012, ICC decided to get involved in order to resolve this long standing dispute.

In 2014, another dispute between WICB and West Indian Players Association (WIPA) led to the team&#x27;s Indian tour being curtailed. The bone of contention was a protracted payment structure.

In 2015, Players has made themselves unavailable for tests, and with Jason Holder being thrust into the role of captaincy, and was met with much distrust between veteran bowlers and Holder and the administration and selectors. As a result, West Indies lost 21 matches by an innings since 1995–2015, when the team never lost more than 4 matches by over an innings combined from 1966 to 1995.

==Rebuilding and T20 success (2010s)==
When Twenty20 cricket began to be contested full force beginning with the 2007 World Twenty20 in South Africa, the West Indies began to develop and realize an advantage of possessing and developing Richards-style batsmen who could devastate bowling attacks with power. As well, many West Indian batsmen put an emphasis on power to prepare for Twenty20 play as it offered them their most lucrative contracts. Foremost among the hard hitters was Chris Gayle, who both hit the first T20 international century and became the first to hit two.

At the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, the West Indies beat Australia in the semifinals and then beat the hosts by 32 runs to win their third ICC world championship and their first since Richards, Holding. and Lloyd had won the 1979 World Cup. In the 2016 World Twenty20, they beat host India in the semifinals after a successful chase and were still cheered back at their hotel by local and traveling fans as they advanced to face England in the final, which they won by four wickets after Carlos Brathwaite hit four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes with 19 runs required off the final over. In contrast to being 8th in the ICC Test Rankings and 9th in the ICC ODI Rankings, the West Indies entered the match as second in the ICC T20 rankings behind India.

== Bowling attack ==
The West Indies generally play fast bowlers more so than spin bowlers. The West Indian team at any one time will generally consist of four fast bowlers (as opposed to a mixture of fast and spin bowlers). They have on occasion played spin bowlers however, they tend to be batting All-Rounders. Examples include Gus Logie, Carl Hooper, etc. One famous example of their &quot;four-pronged&quot; pace attack (as it has been dubbed) was during the 1980s when the attack generally included :
*Malcolm Marshall (fast bowler)
*Andy Roberts (fast)
*Michael Holding (fast) and 
*Joel Garner (fast).
Other pacemen surrounding that quartet included *Patrick Patterson (fast), *Colin Croft (fast) &amp; *Sylvester Clarke (fast).

Their current attack includes:
* Kemar Roach (fast)
* Ravi Rampaul (fast medium)
* Tino Best (fast)
* Sheldon Cottrell (fast medium)
* Darren Sammy (medium fast)
* Jason Holder (fast medium) and 
* Dwayne Bravo (fast medium)

Other pacemen of this era include Andre Russell (fast), Miguel Cummins (fast medium), Fidel Edwards (fast), Krishmar Santokie (fast medium), Shannon Gabriel (fast), Lionel Baker (fast medium) Jerome Taylor (fast) and Oshane Thomas (fast).

<text>M-62 is an arc-shaped state trunkline highway in the southwestern part of the US state of Michigan. The highway runs from the Indiana state line north and west to M-140 in Eau Claire. In between, it serves the western Cass County communities of Dowagiac and Cassopolis. The highway was formed in the 1920s, originally as a north–south route. It was later extended, taking the current arc-shaped routing. A short truncation in the 1950s produced the current routing, which has remained unchanged since. In total, M-62 runs about in the two counties.

==Route description==

M-62 follows a roughly &quot;question mark&quot;-shaped routing in southwestern Michigan. It starts at the Indiana state line south of Edwardsburg in Cass County&#x27;s Ontwa Township north of Granger, Indiana. The trunkline connects with State Road 23 and runs north through farmland to Edwardsburg, intersecting US Highway 12 (US 12) in town. M-62 turns northeasterly running out of town parallel to a rail line up to Cassopolis. The trunkline crosses the rail line and runs concurrently with M-60 through Cassopolis. The two highways pass Stone Lake on the way into downtown. M-62 continues north after leaving M-60, where the change in signposting from north–south to east–west occurs, then curves west to leave town. It then continues through more farmland to La Grange, where it crosses the Dowagiac River at the mouth of La Grange Lake. It crosses the river a second time on the way northwest to Dowagiac.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic volumes along the roads it maintains. This is measured using a metric called average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicle per day that use a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT&#x27;s survey calculated that 2,246 vehicles used the section of M-62 between Cassopolis, La Grange and Dowagiac. This was the lowest traffic count along the whole highway.

The third crossing of the Dowagiac is at the mouth of Mill Pond in eastern Dowagiac, where M-62 follows Division Street through downtown. This section of the highway had the highest traffic count with 9,088 vehicles in 2009. At Front Street, M-51 merges with M-62, and the two run concurrently to the west through town. M-62 continues westerly after M-51 separates and turns southwesterly near the Dowagiac Municipal Airport. The highway crosses into Berrien County south of Indian Lake and continues west through more scattered farms and woodland to a junction with M-140. At this intersection, M-140 turns west along the roadway, and M-62 ends. No section of M-62 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads considered important to the country&#x27;s defense, economy or mobility.

==History==
M-62 was formed before 1924 along a portion of its current routing. The trunkline started at the Indiana state line and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis. The northern terminus was at M-40 (now M-51) in Dowagiac. The southern section was moved by the end of 1925 to follow a more direct routing between Edwardsburg and the state line. An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.

<text>Captain Richard Wallace Annand (5 November 1914 – 24 December 2004) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. This was the first VC awarded to a member of the British Army in the Second World War.

==Early life==
Annand was born in South Shields, County Durham, England, and was the son of Lieutenant-Commander Wallace Moir Annand. His father was killed with the Collingwood Battalion of the Royal Naval Division at Gallipoli in June 1915. He was educated at Pocklington School, East Yorkshire. Upon leaving school he worked at the National Provincial Bank first at South Shields and then in Rugby and finally in London.

==Military career==
In 1933, Annand joined the Tyne Division of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a midshipman. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant in 1936 and completed both a navigation and a gunnery course. In 1937 he applied for a commission in the Royal Navy but was refused because of his age.

Annand was commissioned into the Supplementary Reserve of Officers as a second lieutenant of the Durham Light Infantry on 29 January 1938.
===Victoria Cross===

&quot;Dickie&quot; Annand was 25 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry, during Operation David when a deed took place on 15 May 1940, near the River Dyle, Gastuche, Belgium, for which he was awarded the VC. This was the first Victoria Cross awarded to a member of the British Army in the Second World War. He was invested with the Victoria Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 3 September 1940.

The citation concerning his Victoria Cross was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in a supplement on 23 August 1940. It read as follows:
For most conspicuous gallantry on the 15th–16th May 1940, when the platoon under his command was on the south side of the River Dyle, astride a blown bridge. During the night a strong attack was beaten off, but about 11 a.m. the enemy again launched a violent attack and pushed forward a bridging party into the sunken bottom of the river. Second Lieutenant Annand attacked this party, but when ammunition ran out he went forward himself over open ground, with total disregard for enemy mortar and machine-gun fire. Reaching the top of the bridge, he drove out the party below, inflicting over twenty casualties with hand grenades. Having been wounded he rejoined his platoon, had his wound dressed, and then carried on in command.

Richard Annand&#x27;s platoon sergeant said later &quot;Mr Annand came to me at platoon headquarters and asked for a box of grenades as they could hear Jerry trying to repair the bridge. Off he went and he sure must have given them a lovely time because it wasn&#x27;t a great while before he was back for more.

During the evening another attack was launched and again Second Lieutenant Annand went forward with hand grenades and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. When the order to withdraw was received, he withdrew his platoon, but learning on the way back that his batman was wounded and had been left behind, he returned at once to the former position and brought him back in a wheelbarrow, before losing consciousness as the result of wounds.
The batman Private Joseph Lakeman Hunter was captured and died of his wounds.

===Later military career===
As a result of his wounds, Annand was evacuated to England and he rejoined the re-formed battalion the following month. In June 1941, he lost what remained of his hearing as a result of rifle practice and was discharged from the 2nd Battalion. He spent much of the war as an instructor, including at the Commando Training Centre at Inverailort, Inverness-shire, and at the Highland Fieldcraft Centre in the Cairngorms. 

He was promoted to captain on 28 January 1948. He relinquished his commission due to disability on 29 December 1948 but retained the rank of captain.

==Personal life==
He married Shirley Osborne in 1940 and celebrated their Diamond Wedding anniversary on 9 November 2000. They did not have any children.

On 11 February 1956, Annand became a deputy lieutenant for the County of Durham.

Upon retirement from the military, and because of the injuries he sustained during the Second World War, Annand became involved in helping disabled people. He was a founder member of the British Association for the Hard of Hearing which became Hearing Concern in 1963, and was also involved in the founding of the Durham County Association for the Disabled.

Richard Annand died at Durham shortly after his 90th birthday on 24 December 2004.

==Legacy==

Statues by the sculptor Roger Andrews depicting Annand and Private Thomas Young VC, who served with the Durham Light Infantry in the First World War, were unveiled inside South Shields Town Hall in May 2007.

<text>Maritime Southeast Asia comprises the Southeast Asian countries of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and East Timor. 

The terms Island Southeast Asia and Insular Southeast Asia are sometimes given the same meaning as Maritime Southeast Asia. Other definitions restrict Island Southeast Asia to just the islands between mainland Southeast Asia and the continental shelf of Australia and New Guinea. There is some variability as to whether Taiwan is included in this. Peter Bellwood includes Taiwan in his definition, as did Robert Blust, whilst there are examples that do not. 

The 16th-century term &quot;East Indies&quot; and the later 19th-century term &quot;Malay Archipelago&quot; are also used to refer to Maritime Southeast Asia.

In Indonesia, the Old Javanese term &quot;Nusantara&quot; is also used as a synonym for Maritime Southeast Asia. The term, however, is nationalistic and has shifting boundaries. It usually only encompasses Peninsular Malaysia, the Sunda Islands, Maluku, and often Western New Guinea and excludes the Philippines.

Stretching for several thousand kilometres, the area features a very large number of islands and boasts some of the richest marine, flora and fauna biodiversity on Earth.

The main demographic difference that sets Maritime Southeast Asia apart from modern Mainland Southeast Asia is that its population predominantly belongs to Austronesian groups. The region contains some of the world&#x27;s most highly urbanized areas—the Greater Manila Area, Greater Jakarta, Singapore, and Greater Kuala Lumpur—and yet a majority of islands in this vast region remain uninhabited by humans.

==Geography==

The land and sea area of Maritime Southeast Asia exceeds 2 million km2. These are more than 25,000 islands of the area that comprise many smaller archipelagoes.

The major groupings are:

* Peninsular Malaysia
* Singapore, Indonesia, East Timor, East Malaysia and Brunei
** Sunda Islands
*** Greater Sunda Islands
*** Lesser Sunda Islands
** Maluku Islands
* Philippines
** Visayan Islands
** Sulu Archipelago

The seven largest islands are Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi and Java in Indonesia; and Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines.

In the natural sciences, the region is sometimes known as the &quot;Maritime Continent&quot;. It also corresponds to the biogeographical region of Malesia (not to be confused with &quot;Malaysia&quot;), with shared tropical flora and fauna.

Geologically, the archipelago is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, producing many volcanoes, especially in Java, Sumatra, and the Lesser Sunda Islands region, where most volcanoes over are situated. Tectonic uplifts also produced large mountains, including the highest in Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia, with a height of and Puncak Jaya on Papua, Indonesia at . Other high mountains in the archipelago include Puncak Mandala, Indonesia at and Puncak Trikora, Indonesia, at .

The climate throughout the archipelago is tropical, owing to its position on the Equator.

==Biogeography==
Island Southeast Asia is crossed by the Wallace Line. This line divides the flora and fauna of Asia from that of Australia and New Guinea with stretches of water that have always been too wide for plant and animal species to cross readily. The gaps are considered to be large enough to make accidental rafting from one side to another to be unlikely events. Apart from birds, species that have managed to cross this line include those that have been moved by humans. There is a transitional zone adjacent to the Wallace Line that is termed Wallacea. This is a zone where examples of animal and plant species from both sides can be found, but, particularly on smaller islands, there may be a greatly reduced number of terrestrial species.

The biographical division of the region is important for understanding the spread of both modern and archaic humans into the region. The Wallace Line represents a sea barrier that has persisted, as far as is known, even at the lowest sea levels of glacial maxima of the Pleistocene and the Holocene. Therefore we know when watercraft of some (admittedly unknown) description must have been used by humans to cross the sea.

== Culture and demographics==

As of 2017, there were over 540 million people living in the region, with the most populated island being Java. The people living there are predominantly from Austronesian subgroupings and correspondingly speak western Malayo-Polynesian languages. This region of Southeast Asia shares social and cultural ties with both the peoples of mainland Southeast Asia and with other Austronesian peoples in the Pacific. Islam is the predominant religion, with Christianity being the dominant religion in the Philippines and East Timor. Buddhism, Hinduism, and traditional Animism are also practiced among large populations.

Historically, the region has been referred to as part of Greater India, as seen in Coedes&#x27; &quot;Indianized States of Southeast Asia&quot;, which refers to it as &quot;Island Southeast Asia&quot;; and within Austronesia or Oceania, due to shared ethnolinguistic and historical origins of the latter groups (Micronesian and Polynesian groups) being from this region.

== History ==
The maritime connectivity within the region has been linked to it becoming a distinct cultural and economic area, when compared to the &#x27;mainland&#x27; societies in the rest of Southeast Asia. This region stretches from the Yangtze delta in China down to the Malay Peninsula, including the South China Sea, Gulf of Thailand and Java Sea. The region was dominated by the thalassocratic cultures of the Austronesian peoples.

===Ancient Indian Ocean trade===

The first true long-distance maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. They established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500 BCE, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug and sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, and sugarcane); as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China. Indonesians, in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium CE. It continued up to historic times.

=== Maritime Silk Road ===

By around the 2nd century BCE, the Neolithic Austronesian trade networks in Southeast Asia connected with the maritime trade routes of South Asia, the Middle East, eastern Africa, and the Mediterranean, becoming what is now known as the Maritime Silk Route (or Maritime Silk Road). In addition to Austronesian sailors, the route was also heavily used by Tamil, Persian, and Arab sailors. It allowed the exchange of goods from East and Southeast Asia on one end, all the way to Europe and eastern Africa on the other.

Although usually spoken of in modern times in the context of Eurocentric and Sinocentric luxury goods, the goods carried by the trading ships varied by which product was in demand by region and port. They included ceramics, glass, beads, gems, ivory, fragrant wood, metals (both raw and finished goods), textiles (including silk), food (including grain, wine, and spices), aromatics, and animals, among others. Ivory, in particular, was a significant export of east Africa, leading some authors to label the western leg of the trade route as the &quot;Maritime Ivory Route&quot;.

The Maritime Silk Route flourished until around the 15th century CE. Han and Tang dynasty records mention large Southeast Asian ships (that they called the &quot;kunlun po&quot;, 崑崙舶, &quot;ships of the kunlun&quot;) visiting coastal Chinese cities regularly to trade from as early as 3rd century CE.

By around 900 to 1000 CE, the Song dynasty passed decrees enabling private trade fleets. Demand for Southeast Asian products and trade was partially driven by the increase in China&#x27;s population in this era, whereby it doubled from 75 to 150 million, as well as the loss of access to the northern Silk Road. The first record of Chinese trading ships venturing to Southeast Asia (which they called &quot;Nan Hai&quot;) appear by the 11th century, though the trade routes during this period remained dominated by Srivijaya. The Chinese development of their own maritime technologies led to the establishment of Chinese trading colonies in Southeast Asia, a boom in the maritime trade, and the emergence of the ports of &quot;&quot;Chinchew&quot; (Quanzhou) and &quot;Canton&quot;&quot; (Guangzhou) as regional trade centers in China. Chinese trade was strictly controlled by the Imperial Court, but the Hokkien diaspora facilitated informal trade and cultural exchange with Southeast Asia, settling among Southeast Asian polities during this time period. Despite not having the official sanction of the Chinese government these communities formed business and trade networks between cities such as Melaka, Hội An and Ayutthaya. Many of these Chinese businesspeople integrated into their new countries, becoming political officials and diplomats.

Trade with China ceased after the collapse of the Song dynasty due to invasions and famine. It was restored during the Ming dynasty from the 14th to 16th centuries. The naval expeditions of Zheng He between 1405 and 1431 also played a critical role in opening up of China to increased trade with Southeast Asian polities.

The Maritime Silk Route was disrupted by the colonial era in the 15th century, essentially being replaced with European trade routes. Shipbuilding of the formerly dominant Southeast Asian trading ships (&quot;jong&quot;, the source of the English term &quot;junk&quot;) declined until it ceased entirely by the 17th century. Although Chinese-built &quot;chuán&quot; survived until modern times. There was new demand for spices from Southeast Asia and textiles from India and China, but these were now linked with direct trade routes to the European market, instead of passing through regional ports of the Indian Ocean Maritime Silk Road.

<text>Pavol Országh Hviezdoslav (2 February 1849 – 8 November 1921) was a Slovak poet, dramatist, translator, and for a short time, member of the Czechoslovak parliament. Originally, he wrote in a traditional style, but later became influenced by parnassism and modernism.

== Name ==
He was born Pavol Országh. His surname is Hungarian (from &quot;ország&quot; &#x27;country&#x27;). Hviezdoslav (a Slavic name, meaning approximately &#x27;celebrating the stars&#x27; and/or &#x27;Slav of the stars&#x27;) was his pseudonym from 1875 onward. His earlier pseudonym was Jozef Zbranský.

== Life ==

Pavol Országh was living in Felsőkubin, Árva County, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (now Vyšný Kubín, Slovakia). He was of noble origin. Hviezdoslav studied at grammar schools in Miskolc and Késmárk (now Kežmarok, Slovakia) in the Hungarian lutheran school. The young Országh became a Hungarian patriot. During this time he got acquainted with the poetry of Arany János and Petőfi Sándor and under their influence he started to write poems first in Hungarian, then from the mid-1870s in Slovak. After his graduation in 1870, he continued his studies at the Law Academy of Eperjes (now Prešov, Slovakia), where in 1871 he participated in the preparation of the &quot;Almanach Napred&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot; Miscellany/Almanac), which marked the beginning of a new literary generation in Slovak literature. Due to his contribution to this Almanac with several radical poems, however, he was ignored in the literary life of the country for the rest of the 1870s and couldn&#x27;t get his works published. During this period, he pursued his law career in Alsókubin (now Dolný Kubín, Slovakia), but he also carried on with his literary work in his free time. He practiced as a lawyer between 1875 and 1899 in Námesztó (now Námestovo, Slovakia), and then in Alsókubin again. In 1918, he became a member of the newly created &quot;Revolutionary National Assembly&quot; (provisional governing body, later parliament) in Prague, and from 1919 to 1920, served as its representative. In 1919, he was chosen as the leader of the re-established Matica slovenská (Slovak matica), a Slovak cultural institute founded in 1863, and closed as a result of Hungarian policy in 1875.

In 1954, the &quot;Literary Museum of P. O. Hviezdoslav&quot; was established in Dolný Kubín. A festival of amateur poetry reciters named &quot;Hviezdoslav&#x27;s Kubín&quot; has been held there since.

Minor planet 3980 is named Hviezdoslav.

== Works ==

Hviezdoslav introduced the syllabic-tonic verse into Slovak poetry and became the leading representative of Slovak literary realism. His style is characterized by extensive use of self-coined words and expressions, making it difficult to translate his works into foreign languages.

His oeuvre constitutes some 12 volumes of original poetry and an additional 3 volumes of translations of classical authors. During his era, he was the poet laureate of the Slovak nation. To honor his 1905 translation, of &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; by Imre Madách, he was elected a member of the Kisfaludy Society in 1912.

=== Reflexive poetry ===
He began writing poetry – initially in Hungarian – while still attending grammar school (in Miskolc and Kežmarok / Késmárk)). His first poetry collection, the &quot;Básnické prviesienky Jozefa Zbranského&quot; (&quot;Poetry primroses of Jozef Zbranský&quot;), was published in 1868. It introduced the syllabic-tonic verse into Slovak literature.

An awakened national pride brought him to resolve to work in Slovak, but the inclination towards realism in his early poetry was met with aversion by the older generation.

Among the most important of his mature lyric cycles are:
* &quot;Sonety&quot; (1882–1886) (Sonnets)
* &quot;Letorosty I-III &quot; (1885–1893) (Growth Rings I – III)

Hviezdoslav was also a translator. He translated many works of such authors as Goethe (&quot;Faust, Iphigenia on Tauris&quot;, ballads), Schiller (selected poems), Mickiewicz (Crimean Sonnets et al.), Pushkin (&quot;Boris Godunov, The Captive of the Caucasus, The Gypsies, Rusalka&quot;, etc.), Shakespeare (&quot;Hamlet, A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;), Słowacki (&quot;In Switzerland&quot;, etc.), Arany (28 lyric poems and ballads), Petőfi (42 selected poems), Lermontov (&quot;A Song about the Emperor Ivan Vasilievitch, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov, The Demon&quot;) and Madách (&quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot;). These translations were collected after his death into volumes 12 to 15 of &quot;The Collected Poetical Works of Hviezdoslav&quot;.

==Legacy==

Hviezdoslavovo námestie, a town square in Bratislava, along with the village of Hviezdoslavov and approximately 172 streets in Slovakia are named after him.

The poetry recitation contest , which bears his name in honor, has been taking place every year since its inception in 1954, except for 1960.

<doc id="759251" wikidata="Q3106057" url="?curid=759251" title="The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;The Wish&quot; is the ninth episode of season three of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It was written by Marti Noxon, directed by David Greenwalt, and first broadcast on The WB on December 8, 1998.

Although a standalone episode, &quot;The Wish&quot; is considered one of the best episodes of the show.

==Plot==
Cordelia returns to school only to be rejected by Harmony and her former clique, who taunt her as &quot;Xander&#x27;s castoff&quot;. She goes to The Bronze where Buffy accidentally humiliates her further by knocking her into a pile of trash in front of her friends. Cordelia decides that Buffy is to blame for her predicament.

The next day, new girl Anya gives Cordelia an amulet while trying to goad her into wishing something bad would happen to Xander. Instead Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale. Anya immediately transforms into Anyanka, the vengeance demon of scorned and wronged women, and grants the wish.

Cordelia is once again popular in school, her Cordettes are at her beck and call, and handsome jock John Lee wants to date her. Her happiness is short lived when she realises that the town is overrun by vampires. The Master has risen and created a vast army of vampires, which terrorize the surviving humans. Most of the students are either dead or vampires and there is a nighttime curfew. Walking through the streets at night Cordelia encounters Xander and Willow who are now aggressive, capricious vampires. She is saved by a group of vampire fighters led by Giles. Cordelia tries to explain to Giles what happened and asks to have Buffy back so that things could be the way they were; but, before she can elaborate, she is killed by Xander and Willow.

Giles calls Buffy&#x27;s contacts in Cleveland but is able only to leave a message for the very busy Slayer. He learns that the amulet Cordelia was wearing is that of Anyanka, whose granted wishes can be undone only if her center of power is destroyed.

The Master has created machinery to industrialize harvesting of blood from captive humans. Giles, on his way home, is nearly captured by vampires who are rounding up humans for the plant; he is rescued by Buffy, the slayer, who in this reality is cold and cynical. She doubts that Giles can reverse Anya&#x27;s spell, but does offer to kill the Master. Buffy finds Angel imprisoned; when she sees that he is a vampire, she initially rejects his help, but the marks of torture on his chest persuade her that he is no friend of the Master.

The Master starts up the plant with the first human victim before a cage of prisoners, including Oz and Larry. Buffy and Angel attack the vampires. During the battle, Xander kills Angel, Buffy kills Xander, Oz kills Willow, and the Master breaks Buffy&#x27;s neck.

Meanwhile, Giles uses a spell to summon Anyanka to his house. He guesses that Anyanka&#x27;s own amulet is the center of her powers and smashes it, restoring the original reality. Cordelia once again makes the wish and Anyanka tries to grant it, but without her amulet she is powerless.

==Cultural references==
Mike Loschiavo notes, &quot;Most good genre series play with the idea of a parallel timeline. &quot;Star Trek&quot; might be one of the earliest of the big franchises to do it with &quot;Mirror, Mirror.&quot; &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; have all visited that same timeline all to varying degrees of success. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; gave us our first taste with &quot;Inferno&quot; and in the modern era, The &quot;Rise of the Cybermen.&quot; Perhaps &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s most profound alternate timeline episode however is &quot;Turn Left,&quot; where we see what happened to the world without the Doctor there to save us.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Vox&quot; ranked it at #10 on their &quot;Every Episode Ranked From Worst to Best&quot; list, writing, &quot;Plunging a show into a parallel universe is bold. Plunging a show into a parallel universe in which everyone we love dies by the end of the episode is some next-level trolling... It might be a bit hyperbolic, but everything from Vampire Willow playing with Angel as her &#x27;puppy&#x27; to the episode&#x27;s desperate showdown between Giles and Anya is just too gripping for us to care.&quot;

&quot;Paste Magazine&quot;, in a similar list, ranked it at #9 and said it &quot;packs one of the strongest emotional wallops of the series. The alternate reality is predictably nightmarish and The Master&#x27;s assembly line of bloodletting is horrific, but watching our heroes kill each other over and over again is brutal. The real genius in this episode is who kills whom and how it relates to the real world: Xander and Willow, the pair that essentially caused this brutal alternate reality in &#x27;Lover&#x27;s Walk,&#x27; drain Cordelia, one of the injured parties; Xander kills Angel, the vampire he never truly trusted; Buffy in turn avenges her alt.lover by staking Xander, while Oz kills Willow. Finally, The Master snaps Buffy&#x27;s neck. The last five minutes are like watching all your friends die. It&#x27;s exceedingly tough to watch, but no less marvelous as a work of art.&quot;

Rhonda Wilcox and David Lavery described &quot;The Wish&quot; as &quot;one of the darkest of &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes. The moment Vamp Xander and Vamp Willow kill Cordelia—without remorse and with visible pleasure—the tone of the episode shifts, climaxing in the scene where the cast regulars are killed in slow motion and with haunting music underneath.&quot;

Matthew Pateman praised the performance of Mark Metcalf as the Master. He also points out the satire involved in the Master&#x27;s plan to mechanize the draining of blood, its implicit criticism of progress through mass production, and the script&#x27;s reference to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; where such themes are explored.

Lewis Call said the episode was a &quot;multi-signifying masterpiece&quot;. In &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, an earlier episode also written by Marti Noxon, a love-struck Willow responds to Xander&#x27;s threat to use force with an enthusiastic &quot;Force is OK!&quot; Call writes that this indicates a character trait in Willow that is brought to the fore in &quot;The Wish&quot; where she is portrayed as polymorphously perverse and sadomasochistic.

Roger Pocock writes, &quot;Sci-fi and fantasy are genres that are joined at the hip, so the idea easily translates to the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe, with a wish being granted so that history has followed a different course. By necessity we never quite get a punchline to this. ... Although it’s slightly frustrating that Cordelia never learns how much better life is with Buffy around, it’s doubly frustrating that Buffy never learns that either.&quot;

Jennifer Armstrong of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; singled out &quot;The Wish&quot; as the 8th best episode of the show.

<doc id="759255" wikidata="Q5176587" url="?curid=759255" title="Councils of Aquileia">
<text>In the history of Christianity and later of the Roman Catholic Church, there have been several Councils of Aquileia. The Roman city of Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic Sea is the seat of an ancient episcopal see, seat of the Patriarch of Aquileia.

==Council of 381 AD==
The council was summoned by the Western Roman Emperor Gratian to address the Arian controversy. It was organized by Ambrose, and presided over by Valerian, Bishop of Aquileia. Thirty-two Western bishops attended.

The Arian Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, were defenders of the Arian position. The Arian position was anathematized by all the bishops other than Palladius, who disputed the legitimacy of the council due to the absence of Eastern bishops.

The council also asked the two Emperors to convene a general council of both East and West in order to put an end to the Meletian schism in Antioch.

==Council of 553 AD==
The council of 553 inaugurated the Schism of the Three Chapters, that for a century and more separated many churches of northern Italy from the Holy See; in it the Bishops of Venetia, Istria, and Liguria refused to accept the decrees of the Second Council of Constantinople (the 5th General Council, 553 AD), on the plea that by the condemnation of the Three Chapters it had undone the work of the Council of Chalcedon of 451. In Northern Italy the ecclesiastical provinces of Milan and Aquileia broke off communion with the papacy; the former yielding only towards the end of the 6th century, whereas Aquileia protracted its resistance to about 700.

==Council of 579 AD==
The council of 579, also known as the Synod of Grado was a meeting of bishops loyal to Aquileia that helped to prolong the schism of the Three Chapters.

The Council met on 3 November in Grado, under the presidency of Elias, Patriarch of Aquileia, and with the presence of the Papal Legate, the priest Laurentius, and seventeen bishops, and two priests representing absent bishops. A letter of Pope Paschal I, dated April 20, was read out, in which permission was granted to move the Seat of the Patriarchate from Aquileia to Grado, while retaining the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The Council approved the Pope&#x27;s letter.

==Council of 1184==
The Council of 1184 was held on 30 September 1184 at Aquileia by the Patriarch, Gotifredus. The Council denounced, robbers, plunderers of cemeteries, incendiaries, and those guilty of sacrilege, especially by physically attacking clergy. Perpetrators were to be subject to anathema.

==Council of 1409==
In 1409 a council was held by Gregory XII against the pretensions of the rival popes, Benedict XIII (Peter de Luna) and Alexander V (Peter of Candia). He declared them schismatical, but promised to renounce the papacy if they would do the same.

Pope Gregory had responded to the call of the cardinals at Livorno in June 1408 for a general council to be held at Pisa with an announcement that he would hold a council himself, somewhere in the territory of Aquileia or the territory of Rimini. Aquileia ceased to be an attractive venue when its Patriarch announced his adherence to the Council of Pisa and sent representatives to Pisa. On 19 December 1408 Pope Gregory fixed the town of Cividale as the site of his council. His council held its inaugural session on 6 June 1409, the day after he had been formally deposed by the Council of Pisa. The attendance was so embarrassingly small that he had to issue new letters of convocation on 20 June 1409, with a date of 22 July for the Second Session. He authorized his friend King Rupert (Ruprecht) to depose any prelate in his domains who refused to obey the summons to his council. He received a severe blow when the Venetians decided to support the Council of Pisa, since Venice controlled both the land and sea routes between Rimini and Cividale.

In that Second Session Gregory XII declared that his little assembly was a general council of the entire Church. He then declared all the popes of the Roman Obedience back to Urban VI to be canonical, and he anathematized all the popes of the Avignon Obedience, and included Alexander V for good measure. Another session was held on 5 September 1409, at which he demanded that Peter of Candia (Alexander V) renounce the position to which he had been elected by an uncanonical conclave.

Trapped in Friuli, Gregory XII had to be rescued by ships which had been sent by Ladislaus of Naples. Disguised as a merchant he fled on 6 September, bringing his council to a sudden end. He made first for Ortona on the Adriatic, and then Gaeta in central Italy. His chamberlain, who was playing the part of the pope in order to distract his pursuers, was captured by the soldiers of the Patriarch of Aquileia.

==Council of 1596==
In October 1596 Francesco Barbaro, Patriarch of Aquileia, held a council at the city of Udine in Friuli, at which he renewed in nineteen decrees the legislation of the Council of Trent, including the replacement of the Aquileian Rite with the Tridentine Mass. This was part of a series of synods around the Patriarchate to standardise the Rite with Rome.

<text>M-103 is a state trunkline highway entirely within St. Joseph County in the southwestern region of the U.S. state of Michigan. The trunkline runs between U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) in Mottville and the Indiana state line along undivided highway near the St. Joseph River. With the connection to State Road 15 (SR 15), it provides access to the Indiana Toll Road. The current highway is the second to carry the number; the first version of M-103 has been incorporated into the routing of US 131.

==Route description==
M-103 is the continuation of SR 15 in Michigan. It starts at State Line Road which runs along the state line east from M-103. From here north to the terminus in Mottville, M-103 parallels the St. Joseph River running through farmlands. South of town, it runs past the Mottville Township Cemetery. Between John and Water streets, M-103 intersects and ends at US 12. The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense and mobility.

The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks traffic volumes along the roads it maintains. These volumes are expressed as the average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measurement of the number of vehicles on a stretch of roadway for any average day of the year. For the 2008 survey, traffic volume was 3,604 vehicles per day, with 437 commercial vehicles in the tally. In 2009, the numbers increased to 8,252 vehicles total and 1287 commercial vehicles.

==History==
M-103 was first designated as a state trunkline in 1932. The first version ran from SR 13 at the state line northerly to the junction with US 112 and US  131 in White Pigeon. At the time, US 131 turned westerly along US 112 before turning south to connect with SR 15. This first version of M-103 was completed paved by 1934. The routings of US 131 and M-103 were swapped south of US 12 (successor to US 112) by 1960. Since that time, M-103 has been routed between US 12 and SR 15 in western Mottville Township and US 131 has run due south of White Pigeon to SR 13.

<text>The South Africa men&#x27;s national cricket team, also known as the Proteas, represents South Africa in men&#x27;s international cricket and is administered by Cricket South Africa (CSA). South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The team&#x27;s nickname derives from South Africa&#x27;s national flower, &quot;Protea cynaroides&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;King Protea&quot;.

South Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an England cricket team in the 1888–89 season. Initially, the team was no match for Australia or England but, having gained experience and expertise, they were able to field a competitive team by the first decade of the 20th century. The team regularly played against Australia, England and New Zealand through to the 1960s, by which time there was considerable opposition to the country&#x27;s apartheid policy. The ICC imposed an international ban on the team, commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies. When the ban was imposed, South Africa had developed to a point where its team was arguably the best in the world, and even out-played Australia.

The ban remained in place until 1991, after which South Africa played against India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time. The team has been strong since its reinstatement, and has at several times held the number-one positions in international rankings. South Africa is also one of the most successful teams in ODI cricket, winning more than 61 per cent of their matches. However, the 1998 Champions Trophy is its sole success in ICC-organised tournaments. South Africa won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1998.

As of February 2025, the team is currently ranked 5th in ODIs, 2nd in Tests and 6th in T20Is.

==History==
===Beginnings and early developments===

European colonisation of southern Africa began on Tuesday, 6 April 1652 when the Dutch East India Company established a settlement called the Cape Colony on Table Bay, near present-day Cape Town, and continued to expand into the hinterland through the 17th and 18th centuries. It was founded as a victualling station for the Dutch East Indies trade route but soon acquired an importance of its own due to its good farmland and mineral wealth. There was virtually no British interest in South Africa until 1795 when troops under General Sir James Henry Craig seized Cape Colony during the French Revolutionary War, the Netherlands having been occupied by French forces the same year. After the British seized Cape Colony a second time in 1806 to counteract French interests in the region in the course of the Napoleonic Wars, Cape Colony was turned into a permanent British settlement. As in most other parts of the world, British colonisation brought in its wake the introduction of the game of cricket, which began to develop rapidly. The first-ever recorded cricket match in South Africa took place in 1808, in Cape Town between two service teams for a prize of one thousand rix-dollars.

The oldest cricket club in South Africa is the Port Elizabeth Cricket Club, founded in 1843. In 1862, an annual fixture &quot;Mother Country v Colonial Born&quot; was staged for the first time in Cape Town. By the late 1840s, the game had spread from its early roots in Cape Colony and permeated the Afrikaners in the territories of Orange Free State and Transvaal, who were descendants of the original Dutch settlers and were not considered naturally a cricket-playing people. In 1876, Port Elizabeth presented the &quot;Champion Bat&quot; for competition between South African towns. The first tournament was staged in Port Elizabeth. King William&#x27;s Town Cricket Club won the tournament in 1876 and the following year, in 1877, too.

In 1888, Sir Donald Currie sponsored the first English team to tour South Africa. It was managed by Major R. G. Warton and captained by future Hollywood actor C. Aubrey Smith. The tour marked the advent, retrospectively, of both first-class and Test cricket in South Africa. Currie donated the Currie Cup (originally called the Kimberley Cup) that became the trophy, first won by Transvaal in 1889–90, for a national championship of the provincial teams in South Africa.

===Early Test history===
In 1889, South Africa became the third test-playing nation when it played against England at Port Elizabeth captained by Owen Robert Dunell. Soon after, a 2nd test was played at Cape Town. However, these two matches, as was the case with all early matches involving the erstwhile &#x27;South African XI&#x27; against all touring teams, did not receive the status of official &#x27;Test&#x27; matches until South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference with England and Australia in 1906. Neither did the touring English team organised by Major Warton even claim to be representing the English cricket team; the matches were marketed as &#x27;Major Warton&#x27;s XI&#x27; v/s &#x27;South African XI&#x27; instead. Even the players who participated did not know that they had played international cricket, and the side that played South Africa was regarded to be of weak county strength. The team was captained by C. Aubrey Smith, a decent medium pacer from Sussex, and for two of the Major Warton&#x27;s XI, Basil Grieve and The Honourable Charles Coventry, the two Tests constituted their entire first-class career. Even so, the nascent, fledgling &#x27;South African XI&#x27; was very weak, losing both tests comfortably to England, English spinner Johnny Briggs claiming 15–28 in the second Test at Cape Town. However, Albert Rose-Innes did make history by becoming the first South African bowler to take a five-wicket haul in Tests at Port Elizabeth.

South Africa&#x27;s early Test record remains the worst among all current Test-playing nations with ten defeats and just a solitary draw from their first eleven tests, and it was not until 1904 that they began to emerge as a quality international team. They recorded their first Test win against England in 1906, which took them 17 years. The low point of this barren early period for the South African team was an English tour of 1895–96, where South Africa was humiliated 3–0 in 3 Tests by an English side for the first time remotely comparable to a full-strength team, losing all the tests by 288 runs, an innings and 197 runs, and by an innings and 32 runs respectively. The touring English team, arranged by Lord Hawke, included four of the best cricketers of the world at the time: Tom Hayward, C.B. Fry, George Lohmann and Sammy Woods.

===Emergence as a quality international team===

In the early 1900s, the first world-class South African cricket team emerged, comprising stars such Bonnor Middleton, Jimmy Sinclair, Charlie Llewellyn, Dave Nourse, Louis Tancred, Aubrey Faulkner, Reggie Schwarz, Percy Sherwell, Tip Snooke, Bert Vogler, and Gordon White, players who were capable of giving any international teams a run for their money. In addition to possessing batsmen such as Sinclair (the batsman with the highest strike rate in Test history), Nourse, Tancred, all-rounder Faulkner, Sherwell, Snooker, and White, the South Africans developed the world&#x27;s first (and arguably greatest) spin attack which specialised in googly. Greatest among the South African googly quartet was Schwarz, who, inspired by English googly bowler Bernard Bosanquet, regarded as the inventor of the googly, developed into the most devastating googly bowler of his time. He taught diligently the secrets of the googly to allrounder Faulkner, medium-pacer Vogler, and specialist batsman White, and together the four formed a quartet which began to lead South Africa to unprecedented heights in Test cricket. Another important force during this period for South Africa was the all-around performances of Faulkner and Llewellyn. Faulkner came to be regarded as the first great South African all-rounders in the international game, regarded by some as even the greatest all-rounder in the world in the pre-1st World War period.


The Australian cricket team toured South Africa in 1902, with an extremely strong squad comprising many prominent members of &#x27;The Golden Age of Australian Cricket&#x27; such as Victor Trumper, Joe Darling, Clem Hill, Syd Gregory, Monty Noble, Reggie Duff, Warwick Armstrong, Hugh Trumble, and Ernie Jones. Though South Africa lost the 3-match Test series 2–0, they avoided defeat for the first time by drawing the first game at Johannesburg, even forcing the touring side to follow on thanks to some outstanding all-round performances from Llewellyn.

In 1904, South Africa was invited by the Marylebone Cricket Club for a tour of England to play a series of first-class matches, the team not being regarded as sufficiently high standard to play-official Tests. The side won ten out of their twenty-two matches, including a thrilling tie with Middlesex, who finished among the top four in that year&#x27;s County Championship, due to some magic weaved by Schwarz through his googlies. He repeated his heroics against an all-England XI, whom South Africa recorded an upset victory against by 189 runs. Unfortunately, the match was not accorded official Test status.

In 1906, England made a reciprocal tour to South Africa, which this time consisted of a 5-match official Test series. The touring English team was a second-string team, with only Colin Blythe, Schofield Haigh and JN Crawford being those who could be considered regulars of the England team. Nevertheless, South Africa was still not favouriting going into the series. However, in a shocking result at Johannesburg, the inspired South Africans, led by Sherwell and their googly quartet, defeated England by 1 wicket, thereby recording her first Test win. Schwarz, Vogler, and Faulkner led the way for South Africa. Afterwards, South Africa defeated England by 9 wickets in the 2nd Test at Johannesburg, a 243-run win in the 3rd test at the same venue as well as an innings-and-16 runs victory at Cape Town in the 5th Test to secure a 4–1 domination of England. Schwarz picked up 18 in the series at 17.22, Faulkner 14 at 19.42. However, Vogler was not so successful with 9 wickets at 22.33. The series is widely recognised as the one which heralded the arrival of South Africa as a major force on the international cricket scene. The MCC duly complied by inviting the South African team to tour England in 1907 for the first time to play-official Tests. Though the series finished 1–0 to England with two draws, the quartet of Schwarz, Faulkner, Vogler, and White were praised for their exceptional quality of googly bowling, and Schwarz and Vogler came to be recognised as &quot; Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year the following year – the first South Africans to win the prestigious award.

England&#x27;s next tour of South Africa came about in 1909–10. Once again, South Africa was dominant, winning the 5-match Test series 3–2, with victories in the first Test at Johannesburg by 19 runs, second Test at Durban by 95 runs, and by 4 wickets in the 4th Test at Cape Town. South Africa&#x27;s captain was Tip Snooke.

The South African cricket team toured Australia for the first time in 1910–11. The Australian team was then considered as the leading cricket team of the era, in what has been described as &#x27;The Golden Age of Australian Cricket&#x27;. Led by the legendary Clem Hill and the batting exploits of Victor Trumper, Australia won the 5-match Test series comfortably 4–1, though South Africa made history by recording their first-ever overseas Test victory, as well as a maiden Test victory against Australia at the 3rd Test in Adelaide Oval. The tour was significant for the rise of Billy Zulch as a leading batsman of the South African cricket team; and after a resolute 150 in the 1st Test at Sydney Cricket Ground in a heavy innings defeat for South Africa, he scored South Africa&#x27;s highest individual score of 105 in their maiden overseas Test win at Adelaide, a match also characterised by the all-round performances Charlie Llewellyn and the outstanding bowling of Reggie Schwarz.

South Africa&#x27;s next international cricketing involvement was a triangular tournament held in England, involving England, Australia, and South Africa, the only three Test-playing nations of the era. By this time, the googly duo of Schwarz and White were past their prime, while Vogler had already retired. Additionally, retirements of key players such as Sherwell ensured that South Africa was nowhere near their best in the series. South Africa finished bottom with just one draw, but the series was notable for the debut of Herbie Taylor, regarded as one of the finest batsmen of the era. The tournament marked the international swansong for Schwarz and White. The tournament also marked the peak of the short, but moderately successful test career of medium-pacer Sid Pegler, whose rise, coinciding as it did with the decline of Schwarz and Vogler, briefly caused him to hold the mantle of the lead bowler of the South African bowling attack before as well as to emerge as South Africa&#x27;s leading bowler and a resounding success in the Triangular tournament, before commitments elsewhere in the form of the appointment as a colonial district commissioner in Nyasaland forced him to drift out of cricket – meaning that the enormous potential that he showed in that Triangular, as well as the expectations that he could be a mainstay in the South African bowling in the coming years, were not quite fulfilled.

Prodigious batsman Herbie Taylor was named captain of the South African team to face off against the visiting English team in 1913–14, in what would prove South Africa&#x27;s last international cricketing involvement before the First World War. Overall, the series was extremely poor for a South African side in transition, who failed to replicate the achievements of the South African sides 1905–06 and 1909–10, losing the 5-match Test series 4–0 against an extremely strong English side playing under the banner of the MCC. However, the series became memorable for Herbie Taylor&#x27;s exceptional batting, who heralded his arrival as a new colossus in the world game, scoring a phenomenal 508 runs at an average of 50.80 against a terrific Sydney Barnes at his prime, who had claimed a record 49 wickets during the series at just 10.93. The cricket historian H.S. Altham wrote: &quot;The English cricketers were unanimous that finer batting than his against Barnes at his best they never hoped to see.&quot; Neville Cardus noted it was &quot;perhaps the most skillful of all Test performances by a batsman.&quot; It also led Cardus to count Taylor as &quot;one of the six greatest batsmen of the post-Grace period&quot;.

===The inter-war years===

The war brought in its wake the temporary suspension of international cricket. The Currie Cup, which had hitherto not been held during the years of The Boer War (1899–1902) and on the years when England had visited as a touring team, faced cancellation during the years of war (1914–18). Cricketing activity in South Africa resumed to normal with the armistice in November 1918.

Post World War I, South Africa first hosted in 1919–20 an Australian Imperial Forces side boasting cricketers of the calibre of Jack Gregory, Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield, and Nip Pellew. The South African XI lost both of their matches against them.

Australia became the first international team to make an official tour to South Africa in 1921–22. The first two tests at Durban and Johannesburg were drawn, with Australia sealing the series 1–0 with a 10-wicket win in the 3rd Test at Cape Town. Herbie Taylor, who captained the South Africans, finished with 200 runs at 33.33. Claude Carter was the South Africans&#x27; leading bowler, taking 15 wickets at 21.93.

The following season, in 1922–23, an English cricket team toured. Just like nine years, previous Taylor was at his best. In the first Test at Johannesburg, he batted at number three and in the second innings scored a superb 176, the next highest score in the match was 50. Taylor&#x27;s knock included 25 boundaries and was the largest by a South African against England. South Africa won the Test by 168 runs, it was Taylor&#x27;s first victory as captain and as a Test player. He followed that in the second Test with scores of 9 and 68 as England narrowly won by one wicket. In the third Test at Durban he was moved back up to open the innings, he scored 91 and shared 110 with Bob Catterall. The third day&#x27;s play was washed out leaving the draw inevitable in a four-day match. The fourth Test was also drawn, Taylor scored 11 at number four and then moved back as the opener in the second innings made 101. &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote: &quot;Taylor, who hit out freely when fear of defeat had gone, played a masterly game, but he had a little luck&quot;. With the series still level at 1–1, the fifth and final Test was made Timeless to ensure a winner of the series. England&#x27;s C. A. G. Russell scored two centuries in the match and South Africa were set a target fourth innings target of 344. Taylor, at number four, batted for four and a half hours over an innings of 102 however he received little support from his teammates and South Africa lost by 109 runs. Taylor finished the series with 582 runs at 64.66 and was the highest scorer on either side, his total was 278 more than the next South African. His series total was at the time a Test record for a captain, later surpassed by Don Bradman in 1936. His three centuries in the series set a South African Test record which was only bettered in 2003/04 by Jacques Kallis. The &quot;Wisden&quot; report of the series recorded that &quot;H. W. Taylor as a batsman was in a class by himself&quot;. The series cemented Taylor&#x27;s position as a leading batsman in the world.

With Faulkner retiring in 1924, the South Africans, who had only two quality players in Taylor and Cattrell, underwent somewhat of a barren period in the 1920s. However, the emergence of a new generation of South African cricketers, more so in their batting than in their bowling, in the 1930s such as Bruce Mitchell, Xen Balaskas, Ken Viljoen, Dudley Nourse, Eric Rowan, Alan Melville, Pieter van der Bijl, and Ronnie Grieveson once again ensured that South Africa became a top-quality international team. The team&#x27;s leading batsmen during this era were Mitchell, Nourse, Rowan, Melville, and van der Bijl. Nourse, in particular, became famous for his hand-eye coordination and his excellent fielding, one of many to be produced by South Africa in the coming decades; natural skills which were according to legend inspired and developed by his father Dave&#x27;s refusal to coach him as a youngster, demanding that he learned the rudiments of the game on his own, as he himself had. This South African team was also distinct from past South African teams in one respect: whereas the previous teams had been composed entirely of British-origin players, this team had Afrikaners like van der Bijl and Greeks such as Balaskas, regarded by wide consensus to be the greatest Greek cricketer ever.

===The post-war years===

The South African cricket team toured England in 1947. At Trent Bridge, Captain Alan Melville and vice-captain, Dudley Nourse achieved a Test match record for a third wicket partnership of 319. The following year Nourse, 38-year-old captain of Natal, was appointed Captain for the 1948 MCC Test matches in South Africa.

They continued to play regularly against England, Australia and New Zealand until 1970. The membership rules of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) meant that when South Africa left the Commonwealth in May 1961, they also left the ICC. Despite the rules being changed in 1964 to allow other nations to be &quot;Associate&quot; members, South Africa did not reapply. Due to South African apartheid laws, which introduced legal racial segregation to the country in 1948, no non-white (defined under the legislation as either &quot;black&quot;, &quot;coloured&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot;) player was eligible to play Test cricket for South Africa.

===The international ban===

The anti-apartheid movement led the ICC to impose a moratorium on tours in 1970. This decision excluded players such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Mike Procter from international Test cricket for most of their careers. It would also cause the emigration of future stars such as Allan Lamb and Robin Smith, who both played for England, and Kepler Wessels, who initially played for Australia before returning to South Africa. World class cricketers of their day such as Clive Rice and Vintcent van der Bijl also never played Test Cricket despite their strong first class records.

===A rainbow nation===

The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991, and the team played its first sanctioned international match since 1970 (and its first-ever One-Day International) against India in Calcutta on 10 November 1991 losing by 3 wickets. South Africa&#x27;s first Test match after re-admission was played against the West Indies in April 1992. The match was played in Bridgetown, Barbados and South Africa lost by 52 runs.

Since South Africa has been reinstated they have achieved mixed success and hosted the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup in 2003. However, it is widely believed the sides containing the likes of Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock, Gary Kirsten, Jacques Kallis and Hansie Cronje grossly underachieved, gaining a reputation as &quot;chokers&quot;, due to them reaching the semi-finals of the Cricket World Cup four times, but failing to progress into the finals. In the second part of the 1990s, South Africa had the highest winning percentage in ODIs of any team, but they were knocked out of the 1996 World Cup in the quarter-finals, and then were eliminated on countback after tying their semi-final against Australia in 1999.

Their most noted international win was their win in the inaugural Champions Trophy in 1998. The team also won Commonwealth Games Gold medal in 1998.

===21st century Proteas===
In the 2003 World Cup, South Africa was one of the favourites but was eliminated by only one run in the group stages after they had mistakenly counted the number of runs they needed. They have also had bad press for failing in vital matches in global tournaments including the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.

With Donald retiring, Cronje banned for match-fixing and later killed in a plane crash, and Pollock also retiring from international cricket, the team once again changed shape. Graeme Smith was made captain, although following injuries to Smith and Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince deputised as Test captain on 12 July 2006. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the once all-white South African cricket team. Although that racial quota policy, was rescinded in 2007, a new rule passed in 2016 stated that the team had to have an average minimum of six Black players, of which two must be Black African, in matches over the season.

With the addition of high-class players such as AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla, the South African Cricket team started rising in the ICC rankings. After many of the major players in the Australian side that had dominated the early 2000s had retired, the number one place in the ICC Test Championship was a wide-open race, with India and England having short stints as the number one side. South Africa toured England in 2012 for a three-Test series with the winner assured of being the world No. 1. South Africa went on to take the series comfortably 2–0 and claim the top spot in the rankings, a position they retained for over a full calendar year from 20 August 2012. Eight days later, on 28 August 2012, South Africa became the first team to top the rankings in all three formats of the game.

In February 2014 South Africa took on Australia in a Test series, with the winner being ranked No. 1 team in the world. Australia won the series 2–1. South Africa later in the year would regain the No. 1 ranking. As of 4 May 2020, South Africa is ranked 6th in Test Cricket.

During this time of dominance in the Test arena, the ODI and T20I performances were far less consistent, as South Africa search for a winning formula ahead of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. A notable ODI series loss to New Zealand at home in January 2013, and a further loss in Sri Lanka highlighted South Africa&#x27;s recent difficulties. Exits from the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy only served to improve South Africa&#x27;s reputation as &#x27;chokers&#x27; in major tournaments. In the latter years of Smith&#x27;s career, South Africa split the captaincy in the shorter forms of the game, with the ODI side being led by AB de Villiers and the T20I side by Faf du Plessis. After Smith&#x27;s retirement, Hashim Amla was appointed captain of the test side, leading his side to victory in his first test in charge, in Galle in Sri Lanka.

==Tournaments==

South Africa has a record of failing to win world cups and is much-maligned because of this. The 1992 Cricket World Cup, for example, featured a rain-affected semi-final played before the introduction of the Duckworth-Lewis rain rule. South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain intervened. After the delay, they were left in the situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball to progress. In 1996 they were eliminated in the quarter-finals despite being one of the fancied teams and having qualified first in their group. In 1999 South Africa lost in the semi-final to eventual champions Australia. The match ended in a tie with both South Africa and Australia managing 213 but Australia advanced to the Final as Australia finished higher than South Africa in the group.

South Africa hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup but failed to progress beyond the group stage due to a misunderstanding of how many runs they needed to score in a rain-affected run chase. As a result of this, Shaun Pollock resigned as captain and was replaced by young batsman Graeme Smith, although Pollock continued to play for the team. Under Smith&#x27;s leadership, South Africa has achieved some success, although they have been hampered by the retirements of many star players, including fast bowler Allan Donald and one-day specialist Jonty Rhodes. As a result, they had a poor 2004, only winning against the Windies.

In the 2007 Cricket World Cup they had a rollercoaster ride that included dominant wins over England, the West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland, and a narrow win over Sri Lanka, but devastating losses to Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh that cost them the No. 1 ranking. Then they bowed out in the semi-finals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets.

In the 2011 World Cup, South Africa topped Group B with the distinction of bowling out every side they played within the 50 over the limit, which also included a famous victory over hosts India. In the quarter-final, they were beaten by New Zealand after suffering a dramatic collapse and losing eight wickets for 64 runs.

Even after many setbacks, their biggest heartbreak was awaiting them in the 2015 World cup semi-final where they lost to the tournament runners-up New Zealand in a rain-affected tie. Batting first South Africa posted 281–5 and set a revised target of 298 to New Zealand, thanks to an amazing batting performance by Faf du Plessis, David Miller and captain AB de Villiers. Chasing a mammoth target of 298 New Zealand got off to a flier inspired by their captain Brendon McCullum. But the real hero of the match was Grant Elliott, who scored 84* including a second-last ball six off the then world&#x27;s best bowler Dale Steyn. This saw South Africa crash out of the 2015 World Cup despite playing some fantastic cricket throughout the entire tournament. After a good world cup, South Africa went on to dominate ODI cricket in bilateral series which saw the Proteas rise to No. 1 in the ICC ODI Championship.

At the 2019 Cricket World Cup South Africa lost the opening match of the tournament to England and followed this up with losses to Bangladesh and India. Rained out against West Indies, they defeated Afghanistan but then lost to New Zealand and Pakistan, to end their chances of qualifying for the next stage.

They also hold the record of the highest successful run chase and made the highest total (the latter record has been surpassed) in One-Day Internationals (438–9 in 49.5 overs), in an iconic match against Australia on 12 March 2006. This game is considered by many to be the greatest One-Day International ever played.

South Africa beat the Netherlands by 231 runs in Mohali in Group matches in ICC World Cup 2011, The 231-run win is the fourth-largest margin of victory for any team in World Cups and the largest for South Africa in World Cups. It is also the second-largest margin of victory for South Africa in ODIs on 3 March 2011.
The 87-run stand between JP Duminy and Colin Ingram is the highest for the sixth wicket for South Africa in World Cups. The highest sixth-wicket stand for South Africa in ODIs is the 137 between Hansie Cronje and Shaun Pollock against Zimbabwe in 1997. The triumph is South Africa&#x27;s seventh by a fringe of hundred or more runs in World Cups.

In the 2023 Cricket World Cup South Africa reached the semi-final but lost its match against Australia who went on to win the final.

In the 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, South Africa reached the final unbeaten, with a resounding 9 wicket win over Afghanistan in a one-sided demolition. This was the first appearance in an ICC final for the Proteas. Ultimately, they lost to India in the final by 7 runs.

==Team colours==

South Africa&#x27;s kits are manufactured by Lotto, who replaced the previous manufacturer Castore in 2023.
When playing Test cricket, South Africa&#x27;s cricket whites feature the king protea badge (the emblem of the South African Sports Commission) with the South African flag above it on the left breast of the shirt. South African fielders may wear a green cap or a white sun hat with the king protea badge in the middle. Helmets are also coloured green. Before 1996, the cap insignia was the United Cricket Board of South Africa old badge, which was a circle with a ball superimposed over a wicket in the centre and the inscription which reads &quot;UNITED CRICKET BOARD OF SOUTH AFRICA&quot; around the circle&#x27;s border. Before 1991, the cap insignia was a springbok head under the inscription &quot;S.A.C.B&quot; in yellow letters (which changed to &quot;S.A.&quot; with the years of the tour, for instance, &quot;S.A. 1982–83&quot;).

In limited overs cricket, South Africa&#x27;s ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the king protea badge with the national flag on the left breast of the shirt. 

In ODIs, the kit comprises a green shirt with yellow accents and dark green stylised protea leaves and green trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a green shirt with a yellow gradient and the Oxigen logo in the front and green trousers. In both uniforms, the fielding hat is a green baseball cap with white piping and a yellow line on the visor border or a green sunhat, which are both green with the king protea badge.

In ICC limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with the sponsor&#x27;s logos moving to the sleeve and &#x27;South Africa&#x27; printed across the front.

Since 2016, South Africa played some matches with an all-pink version of its uniform, to raise breast cancer awareness.

Previous suppliers were ISC (1992–1996), Asics (1999), Admiral (2000–2003), Hummel (2004–2007), Adidas (2011–2015), New Balance (2016–2021) and Castore (2021–2023).

Until 2016, the sponsor was Castle Lager. During the 2003–04 tour of Pakistan, the Castle Lager logo was replaced by &quot;Charles&quot;.

==Current squad==
For the 2024–25 period, CSA awarded 18 players national contracts, from which selectors choose the core of the Test, One-Day, and Twenty20 International teams. Non-contracted players remain eligible for selection and can be upgraded to a Cricket South Africa contract if they gain regular selection.

This is a list of every active player who is contracted to Cricket South Africa, has played for South Africa since January 2024 or was named in the recent Test, ODI or T20I squads. Uncapped players are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

<text>In chemistry, the amount of substance (symbol ) in a given sample of matter is defined as a ratio () between the number of elementary entities () and the Avogadro constant (). Since 2019, the value of the Avogadro constant is defined to be exactly . The elementary entities are usually molecules, atoms, ions, or ion pairs of a specified kind. The particular substance sampled may be specified using a subscript, e.g., the amount of sodium chloride (NaCl) would be denoted as . The unit of amount of substance in the International System of Units is the mole (symbol: mol), a base unit. Sometimes, the amount of substance is referred to as the chemical amount or, informally, as the &quot;number of moles&quot; in a given sample of matter.

== Usage ==
Historically, the mole was defined as the amount of substance in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. As a consequence, the mass of one mole of a chemical compound, in grams, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the mass of one molecule or formula unit of the compound, in daltons, and the molar mass of an isotope in grams per mole is approximately equal to the mass number (historically exact for carbon-12 with a molar mass of 12 g/mol). For example, a molecule of water has a mass of about 18.015 daltons on average, whereas a mole of water (which contains water molecules) has a total mass of about 18.015 grams.

In chemistry, because of the law of multiple proportions, it is often much more convenient to work with amounts of substances (that is, number of moles or of molecules) than with masses (grams) or volumes (liters). For example, the chemical fact &quot;1 molecule of oxygen () will react with 2 molecules of hydrogen () to make 2 molecules of water ()&quot; can also be stated as &quot;1 mole of will react with 2 moles of to form 2 moles of water&quot;. The same chemical fact, expressed in terms of masses, would be &quot;32 g (1 mole) of oxygen will react with approximately 4.0304 g (2 moles of ) hydrogen to make approximately 36.0304 g (2 moles) of water&quot; (and the numbers would depend on the isotopic composition of the reagents). In terms of volume, the numbers would depend on the pressure and temperature of the reagents and products. For the same reasons, the concentrations of reagents and products in solution are often specified in moles per liter, rather than grams per liter.

The amount of substance is also a convenient concept in thermodynamics. For example, the pressure of a certain quantity of a noble gas in a recipient of a given volume, at a given temperature, is directly related to the number of molecules in the gas (through the ideal gas law), not to its mass.

This technical sense of the term &quot;amount of substance&quot; should not be confused with the general sense of &quot;amount&quot; in the English language. The latter may refer to other measurements such as mass or volume, rather than the number of particles. There are proposals to replace &quot;amount of substance&quot; with more easily-distinguishable terms, such as enplethy and stoichiometric amount.

The IUPAC recommends that &quot;amount of substance&quot; should be used instead of &quot;number of moles&quot;, just as the quantity mass should not be called &quot;number of kilograms&quot;.

== Nature of the particles ==
To avoid ambiguity, the nature of the particles should be specified in any measurement of the amount of substance: thus, a sample of 1 mol &quot;of molecules&quot; of oxygen () has a mass of about 32 grams, whereas a sample of 1 mol &quot;of atoms&quot; of oxygen () has a mass of about 16 grams.

== Derived quantities ==
=== Molar quantities (per mole) ===

The quotient of some extensive physical quantity of a homogeneous sample by its amount of substance is an intensive property of the substance, usually named by the prefix &quot;molar&quot; or the suffix &quot;per mole&quot;.

For example, the quotient of the mass of a sample by its amount of substance is its molar mass, for which the SI unit kilogram per mole or gram per mole may be used. This is about 18.015 g/mol for water, and 55.845 g/mol for iron. Similarly for volume, one gets the molar volume, which is about 18.069 millilitres per mole for liquid water and 7.092 mL/mol for iron at room temperature. From the heat capacity, one gets the molar heat capacity, which is about 75.385 J/(K⋅mol) for water and about 25.10 J/(K⋅mol) for iron.

==== Molar mass ====
The molar mass (formula_1) of a substance is the ratio of the mass (formula_2) of a sample of that substance to its amount of substance (formula_3): formula_4. The amount of substance is given as the number of moles in the sample. For most practical purposes, the numerical value of the molar mass in grams per mole is the same as that of the mean mass of one molecule or formula unit of the substance in daltons, as the mole was historically defined such that the molar mass constant was exactly 1 g/mol. Thus, given the molecular mass or formula mass in daltons, the same number in grams gives an amount very close to one mole of the substance. For example, the average molecular mass of water is about 18.015 Da and the molar mass of water is about 18.015 g/mol. This allows for accurate determination of the amount in moles of a substance by measuring its mass and dividing by the molar mass of the compound: formula_5. For example, 100 g of water is about 5.551 mol of water. Other methods of determining the amount of substance include the use of the molar volume or the measurement of electric charge.

The molar mass of a substance depends not only on its molecular formula, but also on the distribution of isotopes of each chemical element present in it. For example, the molar mass of calcium-40 is , whereas the molar mass of calcium-42 is , and of calcium with the normal isotopic mix is .

=== Amount (molar) concentration (moles per liter) ===
Another important derived quantity is the molar concentration (formula_6) (also called &quot;amount of substance concentration&quot;, &quot;amount concentration&quot;, or &quot;substance concentration&quot;, especially in clinical chemistry), defined as the amount in moles (formula_3) of a specific substance (solute in a solution or component of a mixture), divided by the volume (formula_8) of the solution or mixture: formula_9.

The standard SI unit of this quantity is mol/m3, although more practical units are commonly used, such as mole per liter (mol/L, equivalent to mol/dm3). For example, the amount concentration of sodium chloride in ocean water is typically about 0.599 mol/L.

The denominator is the volume of the solution, not of the solvent. Thus, for example, one liter of standard vodka contains about 0.40 L of ethanol (315 g, 6.85 mol) and 0.60 L of water. The amount concentration of ethanol is therefore (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(1 L of vodka) = 6.85 mol/L, not (6.85 mol of ethanol)/(0.60 L of water), which would be 11.4 mol/L.

In chemistry, it is customary to read the unit &quot;mol/L&quot; as molar, and denote it by the symbol &quot;M&quot; (both following the numeric value). Thus, for example, each liter of a &quot;0.5 molar&quot; or &quot;0.5 M&quot; solution of urea () in water contains 0.5 moles of that molecule. By extension, the amount concentration is also commonly called the molarity of the substance of interest in the solution. However, as of May 2007, these terms and symbols are not condoned by IUPAC.

This quantity should not be confused with the mass concentration, which is the mass of the substance of interest divided by the volume of the solution (about 35 g/L for sodium chloride in ocean water).

=== Amount (molar) fraction (moles per mole) ===
Confusingly, the amount (molar) concentration should also be distinguished from the molar fraction (also called mole fraction or amount fraction) of a substance in a mixture (such as a solution), which is the number of moles of the compound in one sample of the mixture, divided by the total number of moles of all components. For example, if 20 g of is dissolved in 100 g of water, the amounts of the two substances in the solution will be (20 g)/(58.443 g/mol) = 0.34221 mol and (100 g)/(18.015 g/mol) = 5.5509 mol, respectively; and the molar fraction of will be .

In a mixture of gases, the partial pressure of each component is proportional to its molar fraction.

== History ==
The alchemists, and especially the early metallurgists, probably had some notion of amount of substance, but there are no surviving records of any generalization of the idea beyond a set of recipes. In 1758, Mikhail Lomonosov questioned the idea that mass was the only measure of the quantity of matter, but he did so only in relation to his theories on gravitation. The development of the concept of amount of substance was coincidental with, and vital to, the birth of modern chemistry.
* 1777: Wenzel publishes &quot;Lessons on Affinity&quot;, in which he demonstrates that the proportions of the &quot;base component&quot; and the &quot;acid component&quot; (cation and anion in modern terminology) remain the same during reactions between two neutral salts.
* 1789: Lavoisier publishes &quot;Treatise of Elementary Chemistry&quot;, introducing the concept of a chemical element and clarifying the Law of conservation of mass for chemical reactions.
* 1792: Richter publishes the first volume of &quot;Stoichiometry or the Art of Measuring the Chemical Elements&quot; (publication of subsequent volumes continues until 1802). The term &quot;stoichiometry&quot; is used for the first time. The first tables of equivalent weights are published for acid–base reactions. Richter also notes that, for a given acid, the equivalent mass of the acid is proportional to the mass of oxygen in the base.
* 1794: Proust&#x27;s Law of definite proportions generalizes the concept of equivalent weights to all types of chemical reaction, not simply acid–base reactions.
* 1805: Dalton publishes his first paper on modern atomic theory, including a &quot;Table of the relative weights of the ultimate particles of gaseous and other bodies&quot;.
*:The concept of atoms raised the question of their weight. While many were skeptical about the reality of atoms, chemists quickly found atomic weights to be an invaluable tool in expressing stoichiometric relationships.
* 1808: Publication of Dalton&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot;, containing the first table of atomic weights (based on H = 1).
* 1809: Gay-Lussac&#x27;s Law of combining volumes, stating an integer relationship between the volumes of reactants and products in the chemical reactions of gases.
* 1811: Avogadro hypothesizes that equal volumes of different gases (at same temperature and pressure) contain equal numbers of particles, now known as Avogadro&#x27;s law.
* 1813/1814: Berzelius publishes the first of several tables of atomic weights based on the scale of &quot;m&quot;(O) = 100.
* 1815: Prout publishes his hypothesis that all atomic weights are integer multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. The hypothesis is later abandoned given the observed atomic weight of chlorine (approx. 35.5 relative to hydrogen).
* 1819: Dulong–Petit law relating the atomic weight of a solid element to its specific heat capacity.
* 1819: Mitscherlich&#x27;s work on crystal isomorphism allows many chemical formulae to be clarified, resolving several ambiguities in the calculation of atomic weights.
* 1834: Clapeyron states the ideal gas law.
*:The ideal gas law was the first to be discovered of many relationships between the number of atoms or molecules in a system and other physical properties of the system, apart from its mass. However, this was not sufficient to convince all scientists of the existence of atoms and molecules, many considered it simply being a useful tool for calculation.
* 1834: Faraday states his Laws of electrolysis, in particular that &quot;the chemical decomposing action of a current is &quot;constant for a constant quantity of electricity&quot;&quot;.
* 1856: Krönig derives the ideal gas law from kinetic theory. Clausius publishes an independent derivation the following year.
* 1860: The Karlsruhe Congress debates the relation between &quot;physical molecules&quot;, &quot;chemical molecules&quot; and atoms, without reaching consensus.
* 1865: Loschmidt makes the first estimate of the size of gas molecules and hence of number of molecules in a given volume of gas, now known as the Loschmidt constant.
* 1886: van&#x27;t Hoff demonstrates the similarities in behaviour between dilute solutions and ideal gases.
* 1886: Eugen Goldstein observes discrete particle rays in gas discharges, laying the foundation of mass spectrometry, a tool subsequently used to establish the masses of atoms and molecules.
* 1887: Arrhenius describes the dissociation of electrolyte in solution, resolving one of the problems in the study of colligative properties.
* 1893: First recorded use of the term &quot;mole&quot; to describe a unit of amount of substance by Ostwald in a university textbook.
* 1897: First recorded use of the term &quot;mole&quot; in English.
* By the turn of the twentieth century, the concept of atomic and molecular entities was generally accepted, but many questions remained, not least the size of atoms and their number in a given sample. The concurrent development of mass spectrometry, starting in 1886, supported the concept of atomic and molecular mass and provided a tool of direct relative measurement.
* 1905: Einstein&#x27;s paper on Brownian motion dispels any last doubts on the physical reality of atoms, and opens the way for an accurate determination of their mass.
* 1909: Perrin coins the name Avogadro constant and estimates its value.
* 1913: Discovery of isotopes of non-radioactive elements by Soddy and Thomson.
* 1914: Richards receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &quot;his determinations of the atomic weight of a large number of elements&quot;.
* 1920: Aston proposes the whole number rule, an updated version of Prout&#x27;s hypothesis.
* 1921: Soddy receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on the chemistry of radioactive substances and investigations into isotopes&quot;.
* 1922: Aston receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his whole-number rule&quot;.
* 1926: Perrin receives the Nobel Prize in Physics, in part for his work in measuring the Avogadro constant.
* 1959/1960: Unified atomic mass unit scale based on &quot;m&quot;(C) = 12 u adopted by IUPAP and IUPAC.
* 1968: The mole is recommended for inclusion in the International System of Units (SI) by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM).
* 1972: The mole is approved as the SI base unit of amount of substance.
* 2019: The mole is redefined in the SI as &quot;the amount of substance of a system that contains specified elementary entities&quot;.

<text>Amanda Blake (born Beverly Louise Neill, February 20, 1929 – August 16, 1989) was an American actress best known for the role of the red-haired saloon proprietress &quot;Miss Kitty Russell&quot; on the western television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Along with her fourth husband, Frank Gilbert, she ran one of the first successful programs for breeding cheetahs in captivity.

==Early life==
Amanda Blake was born Beverly Louise Neill in Buffalo, New York, the only child of Jesse and Louise (née Puckett) Neill. Her father was a banker. Blake was a telephone operator and briefly attended Pomona College before she took up acting. Blake attended Brenau Academy from 1944 to 1945. She then served on the board of advisors and became a trustee.

==Career==

In the late 1940s, Blake was signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as the studio saw her as its next Greer Garson. She appeared in a few Hollywood films, such as the 1952 western &quot;Cattle Town&quot; and in the starring role of &quot;Miss Robin Crusoe&quot;, a 1954 adaptation of the Robinson Crusoe adventure. In 1954, she appeared in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;.

Blake became best known for her 19-year stint as the saloon-keeper Miss Kitty on the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; from 1955 to 1974. On February 27, 1974, Blake brought a lion named Kemo on to the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; set.

Because of her continuing role on television, Blake rarely had time for films. She did appear on a number of television shows, including a recurring comedy routine on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;; as a celebrity on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, and the 1970s revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;; and comedy appearances on the &quot;Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;.

In 1957, Blake guest-starred as Betty Lavon-Coate in the episode titled &quot;Coate of Many Colors&quot; on Rod Cameron&#x27;s crime drama, &quot;State Trooper&quot;. Later, after a &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; reunion film, she made two feature-film appearances: in &quot;The Boost&quot;, a drug-addiction drama starring James Woods and Sean Young, and &quot;B.O.R.N&quot;, both in 1988.

In 1968, Blake was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. She was the third performer inducted, after Tom Mix and Gary Cooper, selected in 1958 and in 1966.

==Personal life==
Blake was married five times, first to Jack Shea (1952–53), then Don Whitman in 1954, divorced from him in 1956. After the divorce from Whitman, she would go to the &#x27;saloon set&#x27; of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Blake felt like it was home to her on the days when she was not needed. She married Austin, Texas, city councilman Mark Edward Spaeth in 1984. Spaeth died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1985.

===Animal welfare===
After &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, Blake went into semi-retirement at her home in Phoenix and took on few film or television projects. She instead devoted more time to her animals. She had been known for bringing her pet lion, Kemo, onto the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; set. Kemo lived in an animal compound at her home, at which she and husband Frank Gilbert ran an experimental breeding program for cheetahs. They were some of the first to breed cheetahs successfully in captivity; they raised seven generations of cheetahs.

Blake joined with others in 1971 to form the Arizona Animal Welfare League, today the oldest and largest &quot;no-kill&quot; animal shelter in the state. In 1985, she helped finance the start-up of the Performing Animal Welfare Society. Blake reportedly was a one-time board member of the Humane Society of the United States. In 1997, the Amanda Blake Memorial Wildlife Refuge opened at Rancho Seco Park in Herald, California. The refuge provides sanctuary for free-ranging African hoofed wildlife, most of which were originally destined for exotic animal auctions or hunting ranches.

===Declining health and death===
In 1977 Blake, who was a heavy cigarette smoker, developed oral cancer that was successfully treated with surgery. She became a supporter of the American Cancer Society and made fundraising appearances throughout the country. In 1984, she was the recipient of the society&#x27;s annual Courage Award, which was presented to her by then U.S. President Ronald Reagan. 

On August 16, 1989, Blake died of AIDS-related
hepatitis at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, California, at the age of 60. Her death was initially attributed to throat cancer but, after her death, her doctor publicly announced her death was due to complications from AIDS. It is not known how Blake contracted the disease. Blake’s close friends insisted that she was not a drug user or sexually promiscuous, and that she may have acquired AIDS from her fifth husband who also died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1985.

<text>Sir Nicholas Alexander Faldo (born 18 July 1957) is an English retired professional golfer and television commentator. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was renowned for his dedication to the game, and was ranked No. 1 on the Official World Golf Ranking for a total of 97 weeks. His 41 professional wins include 30 victories on the European Tour and six major championships: three Open Championships (1987, 1990, 1992) and three Masters (1989, 1990, 1996).

Faldo has since become a television commentator for major golf championships. In 2006, he became the lead golf analyst for CBS Sports. In 2012, Faldo joined the BBC Sport on-air team for coverage of the Open Championship.

==Early life==
Faldo was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, in 1957, as the only child of Joyce and George Faldo, an accountant at Imperial Chemical Industries. Responding to suggestions that Faldo might be an Italian surname, George Faldo stated it is of English origin, and had traced it to a 13th-century Knight in Bedford.

Faldo &quot;became hooked&quot; on golf at age 14 — having never &quot;even picked up a golf club&quot; himself, watching Jack Nicklaus play the 1971 Masters on his parents&#x27; new colour television (his first exposure to the game).

== Amateur career ==
Faldo qualified to play in the 1974 English Amateur at Woodhall Spa. In 1975, he won both the English Amateur at Royal Lytham and the British Youths Open Amateur Championship. His successes came too late to gain a Walker Cup place that year, the match being played in late May with the team selected in November 1974. He represented Great Britain in the Commonwealth Tournament in South Africa in November 1975. Faldo describes his late discovery of golf enthusiastically, saying that he &quot;love[d] school, until golf came along&quot;—after which &quot;the only thing [he] was interested in was getting out of the gates as quick as possible and going to the golf course.&quot;

Faldo&#x27;s golf prowess was soon noticed in the United States, where he was given a golf scholarship to the University of Houston. He attended for ten weeks, but he felt the distraction of going to school hurt his golf game.

== Professional career ==
After leaving the school, Faldo turned professional in 1976 and joined the European Professional Golfers Association. Faldo achieved instant European Tour successes, finishing eighth on the Order of Merit in 1977, and third in 1978; and winning a European Tour event in each of those seasons (in 1977, he became the then-youngest Ryder Cup player at the age of 20). As a rookie, Faldo won all three of his matches at the 1977 Ryder Cup including a win over Jack Nicklaus and an astonishing singles victory over Tom Watson, who had just won the 1977 Open Championship two months earlier. Faldo continued his European Tour successes in the early 1980s, winning two consecutive Sun Alliance PGA Championships in England, in 1980 and 1981. Faldo finished top of the Order of Merit in 1983, with five European Tour victories.

In the mid-1980s, Faldo began rebuilding his swing under the tutelage of David Leadbetter, to reorder his game and become a regular contender in major championships (many contemporaries and commentators viewed his all-encompassing swing change as excessive, although later players have adopted similar strategies to varying degrees—most notably, Tiger Woods). Leadbetter felt that although Faldo&#x27;s swing &quot;looked beautiful,&quot; and had &quot;marvelous rhythm,&quot; it &quot;camouflaged a number of faults&quot;. After a series of setbacks, Faldo&#x27;s efforts paid off in May 1987, when he won the Peugeot Spanish Open, his first European Tour victory since 1984 (Faldo later said the win was a &quot;major turning point,&quot; which restored his confidence).

Two months later, in July 1987, Faldo claimed his first major title at The Open Championship at Muirfield. After rounds of 68 (-3) and 69 (-2), Faldo emerged through stormy conditions with an even-par 71, thus entering the final round one stroke behind American Paul Azinger. Faldo parred every hole in his final round for a one-shot victory. At one point Azinger held a lead of three shots with nine holes to play, but bogeys at four of his last nine holes, including at the 17th and 18th, placed him a stroke behind Faldo. In cool misty weather conditions, Faldo&#x27;s solid and steady play in the final round won him the Open title a day after his 30th birthday. He holed a five-foot putt on the final hole for his 18th consecutive par. Faldo later said: &quot;I knew I&#x27;d do it. And I knew I had to do it.&quot; Highlighting a bunker shot on the 8th hole as a key shot of his final round, Faldo said: &quot;The one at 8 was fantastic, a 35-yard shot and I knocked it to three feet.&quot;

At the 1988 U.S. Open, Faldo ended 72 holes of regulation play in a tie for the lead with Curtis Strange. Faldo&#x27;s even-par fourth round of 71 started with 14 consecutive pars. A birdie on the 15th hole gave him a share of the lead with Strange. However, on the 16th hole Faldo found himself with a difficult bunker shot to play. After backing away from his bunker shot to scold some photographers for talking, Faldo made his lone bogey. Strange dropped a shot on the 17th to leave the two rivals tied for the lead on the 18th tee. Faldo missed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th green which would have made him the first British player since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to hold both major national championships. The following day, Strange won the 18-hole Monday playoff by four strokes. Strange shot an even-par round of 71, while Faldo struggled with a round of 75.

Faldo won his second major championship at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo&#x27;s final round of 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him to get into a playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the back nine, Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 feet at the 13th, 5 feet at the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 feet at the 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.

At the 1990 Masters, Faldo successfully defended his title. He came from behind to get into a playoff with Raymond Floyd, once again winning on the second playoff hole after Floyd pulled his approach shot into a pond left of the green. Faldo became the first player to win back-to-back Masters titles since Jack Nicklaus in 1965–66.

In the next major at the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah Country Club, Faldo finished tied for 3rd place. In his final round of 69 he three-putted from 45 feet on the 16th hole for a bogey and missed a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th, which lipped out of the hole. This resulted in him missing out by one stroke on an 18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald. Faldo refused to come to the press tent after his final round and later, en route to the locker room, snapped at a journalist who suggested that he had hit his putt too hard on the final green. Faldo said: &quot;I hit it perfect. I hit a foot past the hole. How can you say I hit it too hard?&quot;

The following month, Faldo won his second Open Championship at St Andrews, Scotland, by five shots, becoming the first golfer since Tom Watson in 1982 to win two majors in the same year.

Faldo won the famous Claret Jug trophy for a third time in the 1992 Open Championship at Muirfield. Faldo&#x27;s first two rounds of 66-64 for a 36-hole total of 130 broke the Open Championship record for the lowest first 36 holes (a record later tied by Brandt Snedeker in 2012). Faldo had a 54-hole lead of four shots in the 1992 Open, before losing the lead during the back-nine of the final round to American John Cook. Faldo recovered with birdies on two of the last four holes to win by a stroke over Cook, who bogeyed the 72nd hole.

Perceived by some golf fans to be an aloof stoic character in the mould of Ben Hogan, Faldo displayed visible emotion after his Open-winning putt on the final hole at Muirfield in 1992, trembling and shedding tears. Faldo later said: &quot;I thought I&#x27;d blown it. If I had lost, I would have needed a very large plaster to patch that one up.&quot;

Faldo claimed the European Tour Order of Merit a second time in 1992. During that time, Faldo said of his success: &quot;The run doesn&#x27;t have to end. If someone is going to beat me then I&#x27;m going to make sure they&#x27;ve worked for their victory. Let them come and get it from me.&quot; That year, he had worldwide earnings of £1,558,978, breaking the existing record.

===Professional career 1993–2015===
In July 1993, Faldo won the Carroll&#x27;s Irish Open for an unprecedented third time in a row. Starting his final round four shots behind José María Olazábal, Faldo&#x27;s fourth round of 65 enabled him to tie over 72 holes with Olazábal. Faldo won the sudden death playoff at the first extra hole. Later that month, as defending Open champion, Faldo was involved in a memorable duel with rival Greg Norman in the Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club. Starting his final round one shot ahead of Norman, Faldo hit a tee shot on the par-3 11th which appeared to be heading for a hole in one, but the ball hit the cup and rolled away. Faldo played some excellent golf in his final round of 67, but he finished runner-up, two strokes behind Norman, who shot a spectacular final round of 64.

Throughout the early 1990s, Faldo remained a European Tour player while also visiting America regularly and playing events around the world, but in 1995 he decided to concentrate on playing on the U.S. PGA Tour, as his priority was to win further major championships (and three out of the four majors are played in the United States). At first this strategy didn&#x27;t seem to work, as he had a moderate 1995 season, but in April 1996 he won a famous victory at Augusta to collect his sixth and final major championship.

Faldo went into the final round at the 1996 Masters trailing Greg Norman by six shots, but was the beneficiary of an infamous Sunday collapse at Augusta by Norman; Faldo shot a 67 to win by five over Norman, who struggled mightily en route to a 78. Though this is commonly remembered as the tournament where Norman collapsed in the final round, Faldo&#x27;s 67 was a memorable display of concentration and consistency which put pressure on Norman. After Faldo finished, he hugged Norman and whispered something in his ear, which years later Norman confirmed to have included the line &quot;Don&#x27;t let the bastards get you down,&quot; a reference to the media, which Faldo assumed would aggressively hound Norman for the loss. Norman said in interview after defeat that &quot;He (Faldo) had gone way, way up in my estimations.&quot; Since then they have become friends and fishing partners, a passion they both share.

After Faldo&#x27;s victory at the 1996 Masters, he had just one further tournament win in his career at the 1997 Nissan Open in Los Angeles, at the age of 39. As Faldo entered his forties, his form gradually declined and he devoted more time to off-course activities. The last season that he played regularly on the PGA Tour was 2001. Afterwards, he refocused on the European Tour and consistently played less than a full schedule.

At the 2002 U.S. Open, a month before his 45th birthday, Faldo finished in a very creditable position of tied for 5th place. At the 2003 Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s, Faldo shot a fine third round of 67 and was briefly in contention for the tournament during the final round. He closed to within two shots of the lead after a birdie at the 5th hole in the final round before holing a 30-foot eagle putt on the 7th. However, his momentum stalled over the next three holes. A birdie at the 14th hole took him to level par and into fourth place. However, three successive bogeys on his subsequent three holes ended his challenge and he finished the tournament in a tie for eighth place. It was Faldo&#x27;s last top-10 finish in a major championship.

After 2005, Faldo&#x27;s appearances in professional tournaments became increasingly sporadic. In 2006, apart from appearances in the Masters and at the Open Championship, Faldo played in only two other events on the European Tour that year. In the first half of 2007, Faldo did not appear in any regular tour events. He did play in the 2007 Open at Carnoustie, missing the cut. In his first Champions Tour event, he finished tied for 14th in the Senior British Open.

Faldo did not take part in the 2008 Open at Royal Birkdale. It was the first time he had not taken part in the competition since failing to qualify as an amateur in 1975. He entered in 2009 at Turnberry and 2010 at St Andrews, but missed the 36-hole cut at both. Faldo opted not to take part in the 2011 Open at Royal St George&#x27;s. He also decided not to compete in the 2012 Open, instead joining the BBC Sport commentary team for the event. Faldo competed at the 2013 Open at Muirfield. He missed the cut. Faldo decided to make the 2015 Open at St Andrews his final Open Championship appearance.

As of January 2015, Faldo&#x27;s career European Tour earnings are just over €8 million, and his U.S. PGA Tour earnings are over $5 million.

===Achievements and legacy===
Faldo has won more major golf championships than any player from Europe since World War I. Only one European golfer, Harry Vardon, who won seven majors in a span between 1896 and 1914, has had more major victories than Faldo. Other than Vardon, only one golfer from outside the United States (Gary Player from South Africa) has won more majors than Faldo.

Faldo was named the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1990 and the European Tour Player of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 1992, and has won 29 European Tour titles. While his professional tournament wins (40) pale in quantity to that of contemporaries Greg Norman, Seve Ballesteros, and Bernhard Langer, the prestige and stature of his successes are impressive, and he has more major victories than any of these players.

Faldo&#x27;s CV boasts (often multiple) successes in high-profile tour events such as the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the European PGA, the British Masters, the European Open, the Johnnie Walker Classic, and the Volvo Masters, as well as his Nissan Open, Doral Open, and Heritage successes in the US. These wins are not only supplemented by his six majors, but also by his wins in invitational events such as the Nedbank Million Dollar Challenge, the Johnnie Walker World Golf Championship, and the World Matchplay, as well as his team successes in the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup of Golf, and the Ryder Cup.

For much of the early 1990s, Faldo was considered the best golfer in the world. He spent a total of 97 weeks altogether at the top of the Official World Golf Ranking, an achievement surpassed by only one other competitor, Greg Norman, during the decade of the 1990s. His total of six professional major tournament wins were more than any other player in the world from 1987 through 1996. (Nick Price was second with three major victories during this period; Seve Ballesteros won five majors from 1979 to 1988).

Faldo is one of the most successful Ryder Cup players ever, having won 25 points and having represented the European Team a record 11 times. He played a key role in making Europe competitive in the event. Having won 23 of his matches, lost 19, and halved 4, he also holds the European record for having played the most Ryder Cup matches.

Former Walker Cup captain Peter McEvoy said of Faldo: &quot;He is a leading contender to be Britain&#x27;s finest ever sportsman in an individual sport. He is the gold standard from which the rest of modern British golf has to be judged.&quot; In 2003, PGA chief executive Sandy Jones said of Faldo&#x27;s career: &quot;His career achievements position him as Britain&#x27;s best golfer of all time. But it is his dedication and commitment to the game which really sets him apart.&quot;

The careers of Faldo and his archrival for many years, Greg Norman, were profiled by &quot;Golf World&quot; magazine: &quot;Norman has played and won more events: 87–43; however, Faldo has won more U.S. and European tour titles: 36–34. Norman has won more money; Faldo has won more majors: 6–2. Norman has won more friends, Faldo more admirers; Norman had more women, Faldo had more fast cars.&quot;

==Playing style==
Faldo&#x27;s remarkable composure under pressure and intimidating presence were hallmarks of his game. His final round of 18 consecutive pars at the 1987 Open Championship was an example of steady play under pressure. BBC commentator Peter Alliss suggested that much of the flair in Faldo&#x27;s game was lost in the mid-1980s when he remodelled his swing. Alliss said: &quot;Faldo had cut out the excitement, but he had also eradicated the mistakes.&quot;

It&#x27;s been suggested that during his career Faldo wore down the opposition and benefited from other players making mistakes in pressure-filled situations. His three Masters titles at Augusta came after mistakes by Scott Hoch missing a short putt in 1989, Raymond Floyd hitting into a pond in 1990 and from a collapse by Greg Norman in 1996. Two of Faldo&#x27;s Open Championship wins came after mistakes in the closing two holes by Paul Azinger in 1987 and John Cook in 1992. His Open Championship in 1990 was effectively decided when Norman shot 76 to his 67 in the 3rd round. Nevertheless, Faldo earns credit for the way in which he performed under pressure in his major victories.

Although not a particularly powerful player for a tall man, Faldo&#x27;s strengths included his distance control, course management and his strong competitive mind. His intense dedication to the game meant that he attended to every detail in the golf swing. Gary Player said of Faldo: &quot;He had a work ethic that was quite unbelievable.&quot;

After Faldo changed his swing in the mid-1980s, his methodical style gave him a reputation for being one of the game&#x27;s more conservative players. However, Faldo did shoot some spectacular rounds of golf at the height of his career. For three consecutive Open Championships between 1992 and 1994, Faldo carded one round of fewer than 65 strokes in each of the three Opens, shooting a 64 at Muirfield in 1992, a 63 at Royal St George&#x27;s in 1993, and a 64 at Turnberry in 1994.

Faldo also had a reputation of having an intense focus and not being engaged in too many social courtesies. 

In 1998, Faldo&#x27;s partnership with David Leadbetter came to an end when Faldo dispensed with his services by post in a letter. In 2003, Leadbetter said of Faldo: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t the most popular guy with all the players, that&#x27;s for sure. He didn&#x27;t go out to win friends and influence people. Very seldom does he call people by name. He was very difficult to get close to. But I don&#x27;t think it hurt his performance. You don&#x27;t have to be &#x27;Mr Popular&#x27; to win golf tournaments.&quot;

Faldo&#x27;s strong work ethic was praised by Leadbetter, who said that during uncomfortably hot conditions in the summer heat of Florida, a conservative estimate of Faldo&#x27;s practice levels would be him hitting &quot;500–800 balls a day, every day&quot;. Leadbetter said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how many balls we hit in total but it was thousands and thousands. He also kept up his short game too – he worked hard on that aspect of his game.&quot;

In an interview in 2005, Curtis Strange said: &quot;Nick Faldo stared a lot of guys down. He had a way of folding his arms and looking at you as though he knew you were going to make a mistake. But in our playoff in the 1988 U.S. Open, I was in a good frame of mind to handle him. We didn&#x27;t say three words all day, which was fine with me. I&#x27;m proud of beating him when he was in his prime.&quot;

Nick Dougherty, who won three Faldo Junior Series events and went on to win tournaments on the European Tour, said of Faldo: &quot;He&#x27;s the most driven human being I&#x27;ve ever known. People say Tiger Woods created the new breed of golfer but I believe Nick Faldo did.&quot;

In 1990, British golf writer Peter Dobereiner suggested that Faldo was &quot;obsessively driven by the impossible dream of technical perfection.&quot;

==2008 Ryder Cup captaincy==
Faldo was selected as captain of the European Ryder Cup team in 2008. The 37th Ryder Cup, held at the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was won 16½ – 11½ by Team USA to end the streak of three successive victories for Team Europe.

Faldo had picked Ian Poulter as a wild card ahead of Darren Clarke, who already had two tour victories that season. This decision paid off when Poulter emerged as the top scorer in the tournament.

On the final day of the competition, Faldo decided to play a tactic, where the best players would start lower down the order; thus, if it went to a close finish, Europe would have its best players in play. This tactic seemed to backfire, as the US, leading by 2 at the start of the day, gained the 5 points they required by the eighth match, rendering the last four irrelevant.

==Broadcasting career==
After cutting back on his playing schedule, Faldo became a broadcaster for ABC Sports&#x27; PGA Tour coverage, where he worked from 2004 to 2006 alongside former playing rival Paul Azinger and host Mike Tirico. While never considered to be a particularly charismatic player, Faldo surprised many fans with his dry, British wit and insightful commentary as part of the ABC team. The trio garnered many positive reviews, with Faldo and Azinger often exchanging verbal barbs and engaging in humorous banter.

On 3 October 2006, it was announced that Faldo had signed a contract with CBS to replace Lanny Wadkins as the network&#x27;s lead golf analyst. Faldo said, &quot;I view this as a fabulous opportunity for me, which may come once every ten years. But it will seriously curtail my playing career. My playing days aren&#x27;t completely over but my priority now is given to CBS.&quot; Faldo&#x27;s decision meant he missed the 2007 Masters, an event he had won three times. In 2007 he also became the lead analyst for Golf Channel&#x27;s coverage on the PGA Tour. Faldo has garnered less positive support since he began working on his own. He and Azinger did have a pair of reunion telecasts, one for each of the analysts&#x27; employers. Faldo joined Azinger and Tirico on ABC for the 2007 Open Championship. Meanwhile, Azinger joined Faldo and Brian Hammons on Golf Channel for the 2009 Presidents Cup.

Faldo retired from CBS after 16 years in the broadcast booth; his final regular broadcast was at the Wyndham Championship, in August 2022.

==Other activities and awards==
In 1991, Faldo launched his golf course design practice Faldo Design. As a way of opening his first course design in the UK (Chart Hills in Kent), Faldo teed up on the dog-leg right par five. He drove into the middle-right of the fairway, he then teed another ball and drove off; the two balls finished within 6 inches of each other and to this day can be seen set into the fairway in a protective case. This was a mark of the man&#x27;s golfing ability at his peak. Known golf design associates of Faldo Design have been Paul Jansen, Steve Smyers, Adam Calver.

The following is a partial list of courses designed by Faldo:

*&quot;OD&quot; denotes courses for which Faldo is the original designer
*&quot;R&quot; denotes courses reconstructed by Faldo
*&quot;A&quot; denotes courses for which Faldo made substantial additions
*&quot;E&quot; denotes courses that Faldo examined and on the construction of which he consulted
Faldo&#x27;s other business interests include coaching schools and pro shops. In 1996 he launched the Faldo Series to provide opportunities to young golfers, under the age of 21 from around the world, both male and female. There are over 7,000 participants each year and there are 38 tournaments in 28 countries. Age category winners at each event qualify for either the Faldo Series Grand Final, hosted each year by Faldo at the Lough Erne Golf Resort, Northern Ireland or the Faldo Series Asia Grand Final, also hosted by Faldo at Mission Hills Golf Club, Shenzhen, China (A Faldo Design course). The registered charity boasts a number of successful graduates, the most notable being; Rory McIlroy, Yani Tseng, and Nick Dougherty.

Along with the Marriott hotel chain, Faldo established The Faldo Golf Institute in 1997. This is a golf instructional programme designed to help golfers of every level improve their skills and enjoyment of golf. The institute has five locations: Orlando, Florida; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Palm Desert, California; Marco Island, Florida; and Hertfordshire, UK.

In 2007, Mercedes-Benz signed Faldo to act as brand ambassador to promote the revival of the Maybach brand of ultra-luxury automobiles.

Faldo has written several golf instructional books.

===Knighthood and other honours===
Faldo was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1989 and inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2000, Faldo was ranked 18th greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine. In a 2019 article on England&#x27;s best golfers, &quot;Golf Monthly&quot; described Faldo as &quot;arguably the greatest English player of all time&quot;.

Faldo was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1988 New Year Honours, then made a Knight Bachelor in the 2009 Birthday Honours, on both occasions “for services to golf”.

Faldo was announced as the 2014 recipient of the Payne Stewart Award on 9 September 2014.

==Personal life==
Faldo met his first wife, Melanie Rockall, when he was 21. They married in 1979 and separated less than five years later.

Faldo&#x27;s divorce from Rockall came before his major championship successes and her settlement was relatively small. He married Gill Bennett in 1986 and the couple had three children: Natalie, Matthew and Georgia. The marriage ended in 1995 after Faldo began a relationship with 20-year-old American golfing student Brenna Cepelak.

Faldo&#x27;s three-year relationship with Cepelak ended when he met Valerie Bercher, a Swiss PR agent working for marketing company IMG. She married Faldo in July 2001 in a lavish ceremony at his Windsor home. They have a daughter, Emma Scarlet (born 2003). It was announced in May 2006 that Faldo had filed for divorce.

Faldo married his fourth wife Lindsay De Marco, now known as Lindsay Lady Faldo, in December 2020, in the Florida Keys, after their wedding at Kensington Palace had to be called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Faldo lives on Faldo Farm outside Bozeman, Montana, United States.

<doc id="759289" wikidata="Q2355166" url="?curid=759289" title="M-205 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-205 was a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The route was turned back to local control in October 2002 by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) after the completion of M-217 (Michiana Parkway). MDOT swapped roadways with the Cass County Road Commission ending the 67-year history of M-205.

==Route description==
M-205 ran through an agricultural landscape from a connection with State Road 19 (SR 19) at the state line north of Elkhart, Indiana, northward for about along Cassopolis Road before turning easterly through a sweeping curve. The roadway is bordered by houses in the area as it continues to an intersection with US Highway 12 (US 12, the former US 112) between Union and Adamsville. The highway went through no towns within Michigan, but did connect with some short local roads.

==History==
When the state highway system was initially signposted in 1919, a highway numbered M-23 ran north from the state line near Union and turned east, eventually connecting all the way to Ypsilanti in Washtenaw County, east of Detroit.
On the original approved US Highway plan, M-23 was replaced by US 112, running over the border into Indiana. Michigan diverted that highway along a route entirely within Michigan, and the very short, but locally important segment of cut-off highway became M-205. The curve between Cassopolis and Redfield roads was realigned to give M-205 a more sweeping curve in 1950.
As part of the swap between MDOT and Cass County, M-217 was designated several miles to the east as a new connector to the toll road, and M-205 was transferred to local control on October 10, 2002, decommissioning the trunkline.

The highway is now identified as &quot;Old M-205&quot; on road signs. Its old northern end, an intersection on US 12 was rebuilt as a traffic circle after the highway was decommissioned.

Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. The ships had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlets, Vought F4U Corsairs or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine torpedo bombers.

==History==
&quot;Tracker&quot; was laid down 3 November 1941, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 233, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Tacoma, Washington. She was originally intended to be the 2nd replacement merchant ship &quot;Mormacmail&quot; for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., however, before completion, the vessel was purchased by the US Navy. In 1942, she was given the designation &quot;BACV-6&quot; and converted into an escort carrier at Willamette Iron &amp; Steel, Portland, Oregon. She was launched on 7 March 1942, and commissioned 31 January 1943; she was transferred to the Royal Navy and renamed HMS &quot;Tracker&quot;.

&quot;Tracker&quot; served as an escort during 1943–1944, for North Atlantic and Arctic convoys. She originally carried Swordfish torpedo-bombers and Seafire fighters of 816 Naval Air Squadron; in January 1944, switching to the Grumman Avengers and Grumman Wildcats of 846 Naval Air Squadron. In April 1944, her aircraft, together with those from were responsible for the sinking of the German U-boat east of Bear Island, during convoy JW 58.

On 10 June 1944, while part of the antisubmarine screen of the Western Approaches Command for the D-Day landings, she collided with a of the Royal Canadian Navy, , causing damage to both ships. HMS &quot;Tracker&quot; continued operations despite stove-in bows until 12 June 1944. Thereafter, she was repaired and partially refitted in Liverpool, until 7 September 1944. On 8 December 1944, the ship sailed to the US to be used as an aircraft transport, and spent the remainder of the war ferrying aircraft and personnel in the Pacific.

In August 1945, she made a final trip to the UK, being returned to the US Navy in November 1945. She was sold in November 1946, and entered service as the merchant ship &quot;Corrientes&quot;, based in Argentina. She was scrapped in 1964.

<doc id="759293" wikidata="Q449645" url="?curid=759293" title="Nancy Lee Grahn">
<text>Nancy Lee Grahn (born April 28, 1956) is an American actress known primarily for her work in daytime soap operas, portraying Julia Wainwright Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1985–93 and Alexis Davis on &quot;General Hospital&quot; since 1996.

== Early life and career ==
Grahn was born in Evanston, Illinois, to a Jewish mother, Barbara Edna Ascher, and a Lutheran father, Robert Donald Grahn. Her parents were both involved with their local community theater in Skokie. Grahn&#x27;s first stage appearance was as a pony in a community production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; At Niles North High School, she played &quot;Daisy Mae&quot; opposite future Broadway actor Gregg Edelman in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Lil&#x27; Abner&quot;. As a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Grahn landed her first credited role, as Mimi in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at the Goodman Rep Theater, 1973–74 season.

Grahn subsequently went to New York City, where she studied acting with noted drama teachers Sandy Meisner and Bill Epsen. Here she had roles in productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. She also appeared in commercials and several industrial films; in an interview, Grahn recalled crossing paths with fellow future soap star Kim Zimmer at the production of several of those films. She also continued to perform in numerous plays, such as &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;, among others.

== Television roles ==
Grahn has made a number of appearances in episodic prime time television, including &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. She has also been seen in the recurring role of Denise Fielding on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, as Connie Dahlgren on &quot;Murder One&quot;, and as Principal Russell on &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

Grahn also has had several roles on daytime dramas. Her first television role was as Beverly Wilkes, Marco Dane&#x27;s secretary on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1978 to 1982. In 1985, she was cast as headstrong lawyer Julia Wainwright Capwell, on the now-defunct soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. Julia was a departure from the traditional &quot;damsel in distress&quot; or vixen roles; she was an intelligent, uncompromising woman. Julia was paired with Mason Capwell, and the two had a Tracy/Hepburn-esque romance. Offscreen, Grahn was briefly involved with Mason&#x27;s portrayer, actor Lane Davies; conflict over their storylines eventually led to Davies&#x27; departure from the series. Grahn&#x27;s performance garnered her a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1989, an award which she shares with &quot;All My Children&quot; actress Debbi Morgan. She portrayed the role of Julia until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1993.

In 1996, she was cast as Alexis Davis, another headstrong lawyer, on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She was nominated for several additional Daytime Emmys, winning in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category in 2012. In July 2010, Grahn re-signed with &quot;General Hospital&quot; for another four years on the show.

== Political views ==
A liberal, Grahn is outspoken in political matters. In 2000, she organized a television conference for fellow Democratic daytime stars titled &quot;Daytime for Gore/Lieberman&quot;. The event was held at the home of Gary Tomlin, director of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Passions&quot;, and in attendance were Sharon Davis, wife of then-California Governor Gray Davis, and Kristin Gore, daughter of then-Vice President Al Gore. During the 2008 presidential election, she hosted an online chat along with fellow daytime actors to discuss the election with fans.

Grahn is an active proponent of reproductive rights. She created &quot;Daytime for Choice&quot; in 1988, and discussed with the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2007 her decision to have an abortion when she was in her 20s as well as her desire to see abortion depicted in a fair and unbiased light within film and television. Grahn is also a supporter of LGBT rights and has participated in the NOH8 Campaign.

== Personal life ==
Grahn is a single mother to one daughter, Katherine Grace, known as Kate, born on February 24, 1998, who studies music at the University of Southern California (USC). 
In December 2019, Grahn announced her engagement to guitarist Richard Smith of Eugene, Oregon, who is a professor at the Thornton School of Music at USC in LA. Grahn has two sisters, Wendy Grahn and Suzi Gantz of Illinois.
She is also involved in various charities, including Meals on Wheels.

<doc id="759295" wikidata="Q182538" url="?curid=759295" title="Pakistan national cricket team">
<text>The Pakistan national cricket team has represented Pakistan in international cricket since 1952. It is controlled by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the governing body for cricket in Pakistan, which is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Pakistan compete in cricket tours and tournaments sanctioned by the PCB and other regional or international cricket bodies in Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 International (T20) formats. Pakistan are current ICC Champions Trophy holders.

Pakistan were given Test status in 1952 following a recommendation from India, but faced limited international success until the 1980s, when they became fixtures in the latter stages of tournaments. They won their first international trophy, the ICC World Cup, in 1992, and then won the Asia Cup in 2000. They saw increased success in the 21st century, winning the T20 World Cup in 2009, the Asia Cup in 2012, and ICC Champions Trophy in 2017. Pakistan won the first Asian Test Championship in 1999, and was the fourth team to win the now-defunct ICC Test Championship in 2016. Pakistan have the second-highest win percentage in international T20 cricket (with a minimum of 150 games played), the fourth-highest win percentage in ODI cricket, and the fourth-best win-loss ratio in Test cricket (both with a minimum of 400 games played).

Pakistan has been plagued by security concerns and domestic instability due to terrorism and the war on terror, restricting it as a venue for international cricket in the 21st century. Despite hosting the 1987 and 1996 World Cups (with the 1996 final played in Lahore), cricket was not played in the country after an attack against the Sri Lanka national team in 2009; Pakistan then played one-day games in the United Arab Emirates until 2016 and Test games in the UAE until 2019. International cricket was resumed in Pakistan from 2016, which coincided with the debut of the Pakistan Super League, following improvements in security and overall reduction in terrorism.

==History==


Cricket in Pakistan has a history predating the creation of the country in 1947. The first ever international cricket match in Karachi was held on 22 November 1935 between Sindh and Australian cricket teams. The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites. Ghulam Mohammad was the captain of team Sind and Frank Tarrant was the captain of Tarrant&#x27;s team. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, cricket in the country developed rapidly and Pakistan was given Test match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference at Lord&#x27;s in England on 28 July 1952 following recommendation by India, which, being the successor state of the British Raj, did not have to go through such a process. The first captain of the Pakistan national cricket team was Abdul Hafeez Kardar.

Pakistan&#x27;s first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan&#x27;s first home Test match was against India in January 1955 at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dacca, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in Test history).

The team is considered a strong but unpredictable team. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has been composed of talented players but is alleged to display limited discipline on occasion, making their performance inconsistent at times. In particular, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is usually emotionally charged and can provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams and players from both sides of the border seek to elevate their game to new levels. Pakistan team contests with India in the Cricket World Cup have resulted in packed stadiums and highly charged atmospheres. The team is well supported at home and abroad, especially in the United Kingdom where British Pakistanis have formed a fan-club called the &quot;Stani Army&quot;. Members of the club show up to matches across the country and are known to provide raucous support. The Stani Army also takes part in charity initiatives for underprivileged Pakistanis, including annual friendly cricket matches against British Indian members of the similar &quot;Bharat Army&quot;.

==Test cricket==

Pakistan&#x27;s first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series. They lost the first test by an innings and 70 runs. India scored 372 runs in their first innings and Pakistan managed 302 runs in combined both innings. However, it just took seven days to turn things around for the Pakistani&#x27;s. In second Test match, Pakistan blew India away for 106 before Pakistan, with the help of Hanif Mohammad&#x27;s 124, scored 331 in their first innings, taking a lead of 225. India were bowled out for 182, giving Pakistan a win by an innings and 43 runs. It was Fazal Mahmood&#x27;s game as he took 12/94. India won the next match by 10 wickets before the final two test were drawn, which resulted India winning series 2–1.

Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan&#x27;s first home Test match was against India in January 1955 at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dacca, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in Test history). In the same year, New Zealand toured Pakistan for their first series against them. They defeated New Zealand by an innings and 1 run in the first test and won the second test match by 4 wickets. The final test ended in a draw, resulting in Pakistan&#x27;s first ever Test series win, with 2–0 margin.

In 1956 Australia toured Pakistan and played one test, which Pakistan won. They bowled Australia out for 80 in their first innings. Pakistan took a lead of 119 runs when they were dismissed at 199. Pakistan bowled Australia out for 187 in the second innings, giving the hosts a target of 68. Pakistan won comfortably by 9 wickets. Again, Fazal Mahmood was the chief destroyer, taking 13/114 in the match.

Pakistan visited West Indies in 1958 for a five-test series. Pakistan drew the first test. It was Hanif Mohammad&#x27;s match as he saved Pakistan after they were bowled out for 106 in reply to West Indies&#x27; first innings of 579. Trailing by 473, Mohammad played the longest test match innings – a marathon 970 minutes for his match-saving 337. The next three tests went in West Indies&#x27; favour before Pakistan won their first match against them by an innings and 1 run. In that match, it was another Mohammad performance. This time it was Hanif&#x27;s brother Wazir Mohammad who scored 189 out of Pakistan&#x27;s 496 in reply to the hosts&#x27; 268. West Indies were bowled out for 227 in their second innings but the series went to them by 3–1.

===Performance during the 1970s till the 1990s===

From 1970 to 1979, Pakistan played over 13 Test series, which they won 3, lost 5 and drew 5. In total of 41 Test matches, Pakistan won 6, lost 12 and drew 23. They had a below par performance. But from 1980 to 1989, they did better. Out of 21 Test series they have played from that period, they won 9, lost 5 and drew 7. In terms of matches, they played total of 72 matches, winning 20 and losing 12 with 40 draws. In 1987, Pakistan went to India for five match series. It was Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s last test series. The first four test went draw but the final match was thriller. Pakistan scored 116 before India scored 145. Pakistan came back with 249 on board, giving the host a target of 220. India fell 16 runs short and the series was considered one of the best India-Pakistan series. In 1988, after West Indies tour where they drew 1–1 (3), Pakistan were rated as No.1 Test team. It was one of greatest moments in their history.

From 1990 to 1999, Pakistan did even better. They played 29 series, winning over 15 and losing 9 with 5 drawn. In terms of matches, they played 74, winning 40, losing 21 and drawing 13. In this period, the lowest point of for Pakistan came in 1998 where they lost to Zimbabwe 1–0 in three match series. The biggest moment came in Asian Test Championship in 1998 where they defeated Sri Lanka in the final by an innings and 175 runs.

===21st century===
In 2002, Pakistan participated in their second Asian Test Championship. It was originally planned to include all four Asian ICC full-members (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). However, before the tournament started, India&#x27;s participation was put in doubt. After defeating Bangladesh in the 1st Test to meet Sri Lanka in the final, they were defeated by them by 8 wickets.
A major controversy occurred in 2006 when the team toured England for a four-match Test series. England led the series 2–0 going into the final Test. In the first innings of that match, they were bowled out for 173 and Pakistan scored 504 in reply. In the second innings, after the dismissal of Alastair Cook for 83 off a reverse-swinging from Umar Gul, umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove called a halt to play as they adjudged Pakistan to be guilty of ball tampering. The ball was replaced and England was awarded 5 penalty runs. This event was the catalyst for the subsequent refusal to continue the match after tea by the Pakistan team. Based on the Laws of Cricket, the umpires declared Pakistan to have forfeited the game. The ICC later changed the result of the match to a draw, and subsequently reinstated the original result on 1 February 2009.

===2010 spot-fixing scandal===

The Pakistan cricket team toured England from 29 July to 22 September 2010. The tour consisted of four Tests, two T20Is and five ODIs. During the Test series, Pakistan lost the first two Test by 354 runs and 9 wickets. They came back to win the third Test by 4 wickets. However, in the fourth Test, the spot-fixing took place. On the third day of the 4th Test, British newspaper News of the World published a story with allegations that an agent loosely affiliated with some of the Pakistani players (later identified as Mazhar Majeed) had accepted a £150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporters for information that two Pakistani bowlers (Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir) would deliberately deliver no balls at specific points during the match. The third player was also caught. It was Pakistan&#x27;s Test skipper Salman Butt, who was revealed to be the master mind of this case. On 1 November 2011, Asif, Amir, and Butt were found guilty for their part in the spot-fixing and were given prison sentences, ranging from six months to 30 months and now Amir played well.

===Under Misbah-ul-Haq===

After Amir, Asif and Butt were dismissed, Pakistan made Misbah ul Haq the new captain of Pakistan. In subsequent series against South Africa in the UAE he led Pakistan in tests. After resignation of Shahid Afridi as test captain and suspension of Salman Butt due to spot-fixing scandal, Misbah was preferred over Younus Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Kamran Akmal as captain. Wasim Akram stated that although the decision was surprising, if Misbah bats and fields well everything else will go according to plan.

Former Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson stated that he believed Misbah has the best cricketing brain within Pakistan and he will do incredibly well in the plans for the captaincy Misbah hit back at those who criticised the decision to appoint him captain and stated that he should be given a chance to prove himself.

In Misbah&#x27;s first series against South Africa in UAE 2010, he led the two match Test series to draw 0–0. Later the team toured New Zealand where they won two match Test series 1–0. Pakistan also went to West Indies and Zimbabwe for two Match and lone Test match. They drew 1–1 and won 1–0 over West Indies and Zimbabwe respectively.
They also won against the touring Sri Lankan team, winning 1–0 (3) and whitewashed Bangladesh 2–0 (2).

One of the most biggest moment for Pakistan under Misbah&#x27;s captaincy was when they whitewashed England, the then no.1 side, who toured UAE in early 2012. Mohsin Khan, the Pakistan coach, compared his team&#x27;s whitewash against England to the 1992 Cricket World Cup triumph. &quot;Today is like a dream come true,&quot; Mohsin told Sky Sports. &quot;It&#x27;s not a very experienced team but it&#x27;s very talented. Today, the captain and all the players have proved they are one of the best in the world. It&#x27;s a great achievement for the Pakistan team.&quot;

Against the South Africa cricket team in 2013 tour, they were badly whitewashed by the Proteas by 3–0 (3). In first Test, they were bowled out for 49, the worst in their history. That was considered to be worst performance against top side. At the same year, they also got their second defeat to Zimbabwe when Pakistan toured for two match Test series. The series was drawn 1–1. In early 2014, against Sri Lanka who toured UAE for 3 match series, Pakistan were down 1–0 after two match. In the final match, the first four days went nowhere until the early fifth day when Pakistan managed to bowl out the Sri Lankan cricket team for 214 and were asked to chase 301 in last two and a half session. Pakistan chased it down in 57.3 overs, the fastest chase in Test cricket history.

Another greatest performance from Pakistan is when they whitewashed the touring Australian cricket team. After beating Pakistan 1–0 in T20Is and 3–0 in ODIs, Pakistan were doubtful to win a two match Test series against the tourist. However, Pakistan won the matches by 221 runs and 356 runs. The win in the second Test was their highest winning margin against any opposition in their history. Also in the same match, Misbah equaled the then fastest Test match century off 56 deliveries.

Against New Zealand, who toured Pakistan for 3 Test match series. After winning the first Test, Misbah became Pakistan&#x27;s most successful Test captain win 15 wins, taking over Imran Khan and Javed Miandad&#x27;s joint 14 win record. The series went to draw 1–1 (3).

Another moment for Pakistan under Misbah was when Pakistan toured Sri Lanka and defeated them in three match Test series. There, it was the first time Pakistan defeat Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka after 9 years. And when England toured UAE for three match Test series, Pakistan defeated them 2–0 (3). As a result, they climbed to No.2 in Test rankings, also after 9 years.

===Rise to No.1 in Tests===

In 2016, Pakistan became No.1 Test team after their tour of England, where they drew series 2–2 (4). It was the first time since the ranking system were introduced, they were crowned No.1 and first time since 1988. It was another great achievement in Pakistan&#x27;s Test history. They were also given Test mace in Lahore. However, their No.1 rank was short-lived, as their downfall began. After winning the series against the West Indies 2–1 (3) in UAE, Pakistan toured New Zealand and Australia for two match and three match Test series. They lost all five matches plus one lost against West Indies. They were down at No.5 in rankings. Misbah was considering retirement after the Australia tour but stayed till West Indies tour, saying he had &#x27;one last job to do&#x27;.

Despite having major upsets in the southern continent, Pakistan were triumphant in the West Indies tour of 2017, having won the T20 series 3–1, the ODI series by 2–1, and winning a thriller in the 3rd test to seal it 2–1. This was Pakistan&#x27;s first ever test series win in the Caribbean. Misbah-ul-Haq and Younus Khan retired after, with the captaincy going to Sarfaraz Ahmed.

==White ball cricket (ODIs and T20Is)==

===1986 Austral-Asia Cup (Champions)===

The 1986 Austral-Asia Cup, played in Sharjah in UAE, saw a last-ball victory for Pakistan against their arch-rivals India, with Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero. India batted first and set a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92 runs per over. Miandad came in to bat at number 3 and Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, he stated that his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his team&#x27;s lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma, which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.

===1992 Cricket World Cup (Champions)===
At the 1992 World Cup Semi-final, having won the toss, New Zealand chose to bat first and ended with a total of 262 runs. Pakistan batted conservatively yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a rate of 7.67 runs per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who had just turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got out, Pakistan required 36 runs from 30 balls, which wicket-keeper Moin Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto the international stage.

The 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand marked Pakistan&#x27;s first World Cup victory. It is remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar and being led by an injured captain Imran Khan. Pakistan lost 3 of their first 5 matches and were nearly eliminated in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 runs against England, until the match was declared as a &quot;no result&quot; due to rain. Imran Khan told the team to play like &quot;cornered tigers&quot;, after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including the semi-final against hosts New Zealand and the final against England.

===2007 Cricket World Cup===
The 2007 Cricket World Cup was one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history when Pakistan was knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat to Ireland, who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in their opening match, were put into bat by Ireland. They lost wickets regularly and only 4 batsmen scored double figures. In the end they were bowled out by the Irish for 132 runs. The Irish went on to win the match, after Niall O&#x27;Brien scored 72 runs. This meant that Pakistan had been knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World Cup. Tragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican police spokesman Karl Angell reported on 23 March 2007 that, &quot;Mr Woolmer&#x27;s death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation&quot; and that, &quot;Mr Woolmer&#x27;s death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a case of murder.&quot; Assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed acted as temporary coach for the team&#x27;s final group game of the tournament. Subsequent to his team&#x27;s defeat and the death of Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but not as captain. Shoaib Malik was announced as his successor. Following his return to the squad, Salman Butt was appointed as vice-captain until December 2007.

On 23 March 2007, Pakistan players and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the investigation into Woolmer&#x27;s murder. Three days after leaving the West Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the detective in charge of the investigation, announced, &quot;It&#x27;s fair to say they are now being treated as witnesses.&quot; &quot;I have got no evidence to suggest it was anybody in the squad.&quot; A memorial service was held in Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, who was quoted as saying, &quot;After Woolmer&#x27;s family, the Pakistan team was the most aggrieved by his death.&quot; After the World Cup ended, serious doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact, and the case has been closed.

On 20 April 2007, a PCB official announced that former Test cricketer Talat Ali would act as interim coach, in addition to his rôle as team manager, until a new coach had been appointed. On 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson, previously head coach of New South Wales, was appointed coach of Pakistan for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the rôle. In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up, after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October 2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB.

===2009 ICC World T20 (Champions)===
In the final at Lord&#x27;s, the home of cricket in London, Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. The first over was bowled by Mohammad Amir. After failing to score off the first four balls – all short – Dilshan went for his scoop and mistimed it, resulting in him being caught at short fine-leg. Soon after this, Jehan Mubarak top-edged a delivery by Abdul Razzaq which went high in the air and was caught by Shahzaib Hasan, leaving Sri Lanka at 2 for 2. Sanath Jayasuriya was able to stabilise the innings for Sri Lanka hitting 17 runs off 10 balls, however, Jayasuriya soon fell as he dragged a good length ball back on to the stumps. Mahela Jayawardene followed after edging a shot into the hands of Misbah-ul-Haq, leaving Sri Lanka on 32/4. Sangakkara and Chamara Silva added further runs before the latter was caught by Saeed Ajmal playing a pull shot off the bowling of Umar Gul. Shahid Afridi soon after, took the wicket of Isuru Udana with a googly which drifted into the right-hander, knocking the off-stump. This brought in Angelo Mathews, who along with Sangakkara took the score from 70/6 to 138/6, with 17 runs being scored off the last over bowled by Mohammad Amir. Sri Lanka finished on 138/6 from 20 overs.

Pakistan started off well with openers Kamran Akmal and Shahzaib Hasan adding 48 runs for the 1st wicket before Kamran Akmal was stumped by Kumar Sangakkara by the first delivery of Sanath Jayasuriya. Pakistan reached the target in 18.4 overs, with Shahid Afridi, who hit the winning runs, earning Man of the Match while Tillakaratne Dilshan was declared Man of the Series for his 317 runs at an average of 63.40. Pakistan&#x27;s win often cheered on by crowds of fans from England&#x27;s Pakistani communities, marked its first world title since Imran Khan&#x27;s &quot;cornered tigers&quot; had won the 1992 World Cup.&quot;We all know how important this World Cup was with so much happening in Pakistan,&quot; Afridi said. &quot;The guys motivated themselves for this World Cup.&quot;

Afridi had a quiet start to the tournament with the bat but responded strongly with match-winning half-centuries in the semi-final and final. He also took 11 wickets in the tournament.

He said the support staff, including the head coach Intikhab Alam and bowling coach Aaqib Javed, played a role in shaping the team&#x27;s victory.

&quot;They all really worked hard with the guys and kept them united and close to each other, that&#x27;s why we had success,&quot; Afridi said. Shahid Afridi was the man who won the heart of people of Pakistan

===2010 ICC World T20 (Semi-finalists)===
The 2010 World T20 was held in West Indies, where Pakistan was able to reach for the semi-final stage. Pakistan, Australia and Bangladesh were in Group A. Pakistan won the first match against Bangladesh by 21 runs. Salman Butt became the hero of the match with his 73 runs from just 46 balls.

With this match, Pakistan lost their defended World T20 title.

=== 2011 Cricket World Cup (Semi-finalists) ===

Pakistan started well in the ICC Cricket World Cup, which was held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, after beating Kenya, Sri Lanka (one of the tournament favourites) and bye a margin, beating Canada. Shahid Afridi clearly stated that his team is capable of qualifying for the Semifinals. After a huge loss against New Zealand, Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 7 wickets. After victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC CWC 2011 Quarters. One of the highlights of the tournament for Pakistan was when they beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display. This saw Australia&#x27;s record win streak of 27 consecutive world cup games broken which saw them win every game between the 1999 world cup up until this game. In the quarter-finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were ruthless, as they emphatically won against the West Indies side by 10 wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the semi-finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India managed 260 after they batted first. Not having a good batting line-up along with a slow start to the chase, Pakistan were 29 runs short as India reached the final (India went on to win the final, by defeating Sri Lanka).

=== 2012 ICC World T20 (Semi-finalists) ===
The 2012 edition of World T20 was held in Sri Lanka, where Pakistan grouped in Group D with New Zealand, and Bangladesh. They won comfortably against the two teams, and stood up as top of group D.

=== 2014 ICC World T20 ===
The 2014 ICC World T20 was held by Bangladesh. The Pakistani team was in Bangladesh prior to the World T20, due to 2014 Asia Cup, which was held by Bangladesh. Pakistan played for the Group 2, with mighty oppositions. The tournament was a disappointing one for the Pakistanis, where they won 2 and lost 2, finished the group as third and disqualified for the semi-finals.

The first group match was with rivals India, which India won by 7 wickets. The next match was against Australia, where Pakistan scored 191/5 with brilliant batting of Umar Akmal.

=== 2015 Cricket World Cup (Quarter-finalists) ===
Pakistan started poorly in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Their first match was against cricket rivals — India. India batted first and scored 300/7 with Virat Kohli scoring a century. After a poor start to the run chase, Pakistan&#x27;s skipper Misbah-ul-Haq made a useful contribution of 76 runs but Pakistan lost the match by 76 runs. The second match against West Indies was a disaster. West Indies posted 310/6 on the board. In response, Pakistan lost 4 wickets for 1 run on the board, a first in an ODI match. The team was bowled out for 160 and lost the match by 150 runs.

Pakistan then won their next four games against Zimbabwe, UAE, South Africa and Ireland. Sarfaraz Ahmed scored Pakistan&#x27;s only century against Ireland and was awarded Player of the Match against both South Africa and Ireland.

The quarterfinal match of Pakistan was against Australia. Pakistan scored 213 runs. Australia started steadily but wickets regularly fell during the middle overs. The match gained a lot of attraction due to the on-field rivalry between Australian all-rounder, Shane Watson and Pakistani pacer, Wahab Riaz. Wahab&#x27;s spell was praised despite not picking up many wickets. Pakistan dropped catches during the first power-play and conceded many runs. The partnership between Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell allowed Australia to win the match. As a result, Pakistan were knocked out of the tournament. The match was the final ODI for Pakistani&#x27;s captain Misbah-ul-Haq and experienced all-rounder Shahid Afridi.

=== After 2015 Cricket World Cup ===
After the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi ended their ODI careers. As a result, the captaincy of the ODI team was given to newcomer Azhar Ali. Under his captaincy, Pakistan played their first ODI series against Bangladesh. The tour was a disappointment and Pakistan lost all three ODIs as well as the T20 match. Clever bowling coupled with wonderful batting and fielding allowed the hosts to stroll past the visitors. This was Bangladesh&#x27;s first win against Pakistan since the 1999 Cricket World Cup and first ever series win over Pakistan. However, Pakistan ended the tour on a positive with a 1–0 win in the two-match test series.

Pakistan played a home series against Zimbabwe in May 2015 after 6 years. This was the first tour by a Test-playing nation since the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009. Pakistan won the T20I series 2–0 and the ODI series 2–0 after the third match ended in a draw due to rain.
During the Sri Lanka tour in 2015, Pakistan won the Test series 2–1, the ODI series 3–2 and the T20I series 2–0. The successful tour allowed Pakistan to qualify for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, removing West Indies from a place in the tournament. The series win pushed up Pakistan&#x27;s ranking in all three formats of the game.

In September, Pakistan travelled to Zimbabwe for 2 T20Is and 3 ODIs. Pakistan won the T20I series 2–0 and the ODI series 2–1. As a result, Pakistan concluded their 2015 season rankings as 4th in Tests, 8th in ODIs, and 2nd in T20Is.

=== 2017 ===
Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan, who had been the mainstays of the Pakistani batting line-up, announced their retirements from Test cricket (the only format they played at that time) at the completion of the West Indies tour 2017. Pakistan won the T20I series 3–1 and the ODI series 2–1 in the same tour under the captaincy of Sarfaraz Ahmed. In his final Test series, Misbah made history by being the first Pakistani captain to win an away Test series against West Indies in West Indies. Sarfaraz Ahmed was announced as Misbah&#x27;s successor. In his first series against Sri Lanka, who toured UAE, Pakistan lost both Test matches. It was first time in 10 years that Pakistan lost their home series, the first time they lost was against the Australian team and the first time in the UAE ever since it became Pakistan&#x27;s adoptive home.

=== 2017 ICC Champions Trophy (Champions) ===

The tournament did not start well for Pakistan, losing to their arch-rivals India by 124 runs. But as the group stages progressed the bowling attack improved significantly for Pakistan, winning games against South Africa by 19 runs, and a crucial game against Sri Lanka by 3 wickets. This set up a semi-final against hosts and favourites England, where Hasan Ali took 3 wickets to take Pakistan to their first ICC Champions Trophy Final, a highly anticipated re-match with India.

In the final before a packed house at The Oval, India won the toss and elected to bowl first. Pakistan&#x27;s batting lineup made India question their decision with opening batsman Fakhar Zaman scoring his maiden One Day International century (114 off 106 deliveries), with major contributions from Azhar Ali (59) and Mohammad Hafeez (57*) pushing Pakistan to a total of 338. India lost their top order quickly with Mohammad Amir getting the key wickets of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli. Resistance came in the form of Hardik Pandya, who scored a brisk 76. Hasan Ali, Pakistan&#x27;s star find in this tournament took the final wicket finishing with figures of 3–19, leaving India 180 runs short of the target and handing Pakistan their first Champions Trophy. The margin of victory was the largest in an ICC tournament final.

Hasan Ali was named as player of the tournament. Pakistan captain, Sarfaraz Ahmed stated (after the opening match against India) &quot;I said to the boys, the tournament doesn&#x27;t finish here. Good cricket, positive cricket and we will win&quot;. After Pakistan&#x27;s victory, they moved up from 8th to 6th in the ICC ODI rankings. The ICC Team of the Tournament had Sarfaraz Ahmed as captain, Fakhar Zaman, Junaid Khan and Hasan Ali from Pakistan.

==Governing body==
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is responsible for all first class and Test cricket played in Pakistan and by the Pakistan cricket team. It was admitted to the International Cricket Council in July 1953. The corporation has been run by former cricketers, professional administrators and trustees, who are often respected businessmen. The Board governs a network of teams sponsored by corporations and banks, city associations and clubs including advertising, broadcasting rights and internet partners.

The PCB&#x27;s experiment with the Twenty20 cricket model has also proven popular and hopes to similarly revive popular interest in domestic games, which it did. The PCB also set up major domestic competitions such as the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, the Faysal Bank T20 Cup, the Pakistan Super League and the National Twenty20 Cup.

For all national women&#x27;s cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts and the women&#x27;s teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men&#x27;s team. The women&#x27;s teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men&#x27;s teams and play fewer matches. The team played it first match during 1997, when it was on tour of New Zealand and Australia and were invited to the World Cup later that year and in the Women&#x27;s Asia Cup during 2005 the team came third place.

<doc id="759298" wikidata="Q516372" url="?curid=759298" title="Linear density">
<text>Linear density is the measure of a quantity of any characteristic value per unit of length. Linear mass density (titer in textile engineering, the amount of mass per unit length) and &quot;linear charge density&quot; (the amount of electric charge per unit length) are two common examples used in science and engineering.

The term linear density or linear mass density is most often used when describing the characteristics of one-dimensional objects, although linear density can also be used to describe the density of a three-dimensional quantity along one particular dimension. Just as density is most often used to mean mass density, the term linear density likewise often refers to linear mass density. However, this is only one example of a linear density, as any quantity can be measured in terms of its value along one dimension.

==Linear mass density==
Consider a long, thin rod of mass formula_1 and length formula_2. To calculate the average linear mass density, formula_3, of this one dimensional object, we can simply divide the total mass, formula_1, by the total length, formula_2:
formula_6
If we describe the rod as having a varying mass (one that varies as a function of position along the length of the rod, formula_7), we can write:
formula_8
Each infinitesimal unit of mass, formula_9, is equal to the product of its linear mass density, formula_10, and the infinitesimal unit of length, formula_11:
formula_12
The linear mass density can then be understood as the derivative of the mass function with respect to the one dimension of the rod (the position along its length, formula_7)
formula_14

The SI unit of linear mass density is the kilogram per meter (kg/m).

Linear density of fibers and yarns can be measured by many methods. The simplest one is to measure a length of material and weigh it. However, this requires a large sample and masks the variability of linear density along the thread, and is difficult to apply if the fibers are crimped or otherwise cannot lay flat relaxed. If the density of the material is known, the fibers are measured individually and have a simple shape, a more accurate method is direct imaging of the fiber with a scanning electron microscope to measure the diameter and calculation of the linear density. Finally, linear density is directly measured with a vibroscope. The sample is tensioned between two hard points, mechanical vibration is induced and the fundamental frequency is measured.

==Linear charge density==
Consider a long, thin wire of charge formula_15 and length formula_2. To calculate the average linear charge density, formula_17, of this one dimensional object, we can simply divide the total charge, formula_15, by the total length, formula_2:
formula_20
If we describe the wire as having a varying charge (one that varies as a function of position along the length of the wire, formula_7), we can write:
formula_22
Each infinitesimal unit of charge, formula_23, is equal to the product of its linear charge density, formula_24, and the infinitesimal unit of length, formula_11:
formula_26
The linear charge density can then be understood as the derivative of the charge function with respect to the one dimension of the wire (the position along its length, formula_7)
formula_28

Notice that these steps were exactly the same ones we took before to find formula_29.

The SI unit of linear charge density is the coulomb per meter (C/m).

==Other applications==

In drawing or printing, the term linear density also refers to how densely or heavily a line is drawn.

The most famous abstraction of linear density is the probability density function of a single random variable.

==Units==

Common units include:
*kilogram per meter (using SI base units)
*ounce (mass) per foot
*ounce (mass) per inch
*pound (mass) per yard: used in the North American railway industry for the linear density of rails
*pound (mass) per foot
*pound (mass) per inch
*tex, a unit of measure for the linear density of fibers, defined as the mass in grams per 1,000 meters
*denier, a unit of measure for the linear density of fibers, defined as the mass in grams per 9,000 meters
*decitex (dtex), a unit for the linear density of fibers, defined as the mass in grams per 10,000 meters

<doc id="759299" wikidata="Q1753697" url="?curid=759299" title="4-Track Demos">
<text>4-Track Demos is an album of demos by the English singer-songwriter PJ Harvey. It was released in October 1993 by Island Records. It consists of eight demos of songs from her previous album, &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, along with six demos of some unreleased tracks which never made it to release with the three-piece PJ Harvey line-up. According to interviews with Harvey, all fourteen of these songs were written and demoed at her home between mid-1991 and autumn 1992. &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; was Harvey&#x27;s first entirely self-produced album; there would not be another such until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot;.

==Background==
Prior to the release of &quot;4-Track Demos&quot;, Harvey had a history of releasing early versions of her songs. The demo versions for the songs on her debut album &quot;Dry&quot; (1992) were released with the studio album in a limited edition double album format called &quot;Dry (Demonstration)&quot;. She briefly contemplated releasing &quot;Rid of Me&quot; as a double album, consisting of the studio album on one disc and the demo versions on another. However, considering that &quot;Rid of Me&quot; was to be her major label debut, a double album ended up being a move that neither Harvey nor Island wanted to make.

Harvey explained the reason for releasing this record to &quot;Filter&quot; magazine in a 2004 interview: &quot;&quot;4-Track Demos&quot;... was partly encouraged by Steve Albini [producer of &quot;Rid of Me&quot;]. He loved the demos for that album so much he thought they should be out there and I tended to agree with him. It seemed like showing another side of what I do and introducing new songs that I hadn&#x27;t recorded on a record. It was a lovely thing to do and it felt like the right time because my three-piece band had fallen apart and I was kind of in limbo before deciding where I was gonna be going again. So, it was just like a small interjection piece of me before I knew where I was going to be next.&quot;

==Release and critical reception==
As of 2005, &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; had sold 119,000 copies in the U.S. The album charted in both the United Kingdom and the United States upon its release, peaking at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Heatseeker Albums chart. Some reviewers preferred this version to &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, which they contended buried some of her vocal range and sonic experimentations under its noisy, in-your-face dynamics. For a side project, &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; received remarkably high praise: &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;a chillingly intimate peek into the fierce musical ethic of an independent and compelling voice&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; hailed it as &quot;viciously aggressive music with no numbing narcotic qualities&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said in its four-star review that &quot;its depth, range and conceptual completeness make you wonder why Harvey even bothered with such conventions as a band or a producer in the first place&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; found that Harvey&#x27;s vocals &quot;stun, especially on those cuts that got the Albini treatment&quot; on &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. Robert Christgau, however, still preferred &quot;Rid of Me&quot; over &quot;4-Track Demos&quot;.

In 1994, Island Records gave away the original Yamaha MT 2X 4-track recorder Harvey used to record &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; as a promotion in issue 67 of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine. The winner was announced on the weekend of 19 March 1994 on &quot;JBTV&quot; as seen on Fox Net and Channel America. The winner, Thomas Wells of Vinton, Virginia, was picked from over 500 entries. In conjunction with being announced on TV, Thomas&#x27; name and photo were published in the April 1994 extra edition (number 71) issue of &quot;AP Wiretapping Newsletter&quot;.

&quot;Hardly Wait&quot; is one of two PJ Harvey songs used in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Strange Days&quot; (the other is &quot;Rid of Me&quot;). In the film it is sung by Juliette Lewis.

==Artwork==
The photo on the album&#x27;s cover was shot by Maria Mochnacz in June,1993 while Harvey was touring to support the album &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. It shows Harvey in lingerie and sunglasses, raising her arm and exposing her natural underarm. The picture was taken at the Watergate, in Washington, D.C. The black-and-white photo that appears on the back of the album (also by Mochnacz) depicts Harvey naked and wrapped in plastic sheeting. When speaking about the picture, Mochnacz remarked &quot;I suggested Polly was now a product so we wrapped her up like one&quot;.

==Tour==
PJ Harvey did not tour to promote &quot;4-Track Demos&quot;. She had recently endured the break-up of the PJ Harvey trio and was contemplating the direction her next studio album would take. Some of the unreleased tracks, however, had been played live during the &quot;Rid of Me&quot; tour. &quot;M-Bike&quot;, in particular, was included in many of those concerts and a live version can be found in the long-form video &quot;Reeling with PJ Harvey&quot;, released in 1994. When Harvey toured in 1995 to promote &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, she also included songs from &quot;4-Track Demos&quot;. &quot;Goodnight&quot;, for example, was used as the closing song for many of the shows on that tour. Additionally, &quot;Goodnight&quot; was performed on the music program &quot;The White Room&quot;, which aired on Channel 4 in 1995. This performance highlighted Harvey&#x27;s use of stage props during that tour (she beat out the rhythm with a long stick of dowl) as well as the unique instrumentation of guitarist Joe Gore, who played the song&#x27;s sliding guitar riff with a knife.

<doc id="759304" wikidata="Q980860" url="?curid=759304" title="Victor Canning">
<text>Victor Canning (16 June 1911 – 21 February 1986) was a prolific British writer of novels and thrillers who flourished in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He was personally reticent, writing no memoirs and giving relatively few newspaper interviews.

==Life==
Canning was born in Plymouth, Devon, the eldest child of a coach builder, Fred Canning, and his wife May, née Goold. During World War I his father served as an ambulance driver in France and Flanders, while he with his two sisters went to live in the village of Calstock ten miles north of Plymouth, where his uncle Cecil Goold worked for the railways and later became station master. After the war the family returned to Plymouth. In the mid-1920s they moved to Oxford where his father had found work, and Victor attended the Oxford Central School. Here he was encouraged to stay on at school and go to university by a classical scholar, Dr. Henderson, but the family could not afford it and instead Victor went to work as a clerk in the education office at age 16.

Within three years he had started selling short stories to boys&#x27; magazines and in 1934, his first novel, &quot;Mr. Finchley Discovers His England&quot;, was accepted by Hodder and Stoughton and became a runaway best seller. He gave up his job and started writing full-time, producing thirteen more novels in the next six years under three different names. Lord Rothermere engaged him to write for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and a number of his travel articles for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; were collected as a book with illustrations by Leslie Stead under the title &quot;Everyman&#x27;s England&quot; in 1936. He also continued to write short stories.

In 1935 he married Phyllis McEwen, a woman from a theatrical family whom he met while she was working with a touring vaudeville production at Weston-super-Mare. They had three daughters, Lindel born in 1939, Hilary born in 1940, and Virginia who was born in 1942, but died in infancy.

In 1940, he enlisted in the Army, and was sent for training with the Royal Artillery in Llandrindod Wells in mid-Wales, where he trained alongside his friend Eric Ambler. Both were commissioned as second lieutenants in 1941. Canning worked in anti-aircraft batteries in the south of England until early 1943, when he was sent to North Africa and took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Italian campaigns. At the end of the war he was assigned to an Anglo-American unit doing experimental work with radar range-finding. It was top secret work but nothing to do with espionage, though Canning never discouraged the assumption of publishers and reviewers that his espionage stories were partly based on experience. He was discharged in 1946 with the rank of major.

He resumed writing with &quot;The Chasm&quot; (1947), a novel about identifying a Nazi collaborator who has hidden himself in a remote Italian village: the novel is inspired by the events of the partisan republic of Corniolo, on the Forlì Apennines. A film of this was planned but never finished. Canning&#x27;s next book, &quot;Panther&#x27;s Moon&quot;, was filmed as &quot;Spy Hunt&quot;, and from now on Canning was established as someone who could write a book a year in the suspense genre, have them reliably appear in book club and paperback editions on both sides of the Atlantic, be translated into the main European languages, and in many cases get filmed. He himself spent a year in Hollywood working on scripts for movies of his own books and on TV shows. The money earned from the film of &quot;The Golden Salamander&quot; (filmed with Trevor Howard) meant that Canning could buy a substantial country house with some land in Kent, Marle Place. He had moved from Stansted in February 1952, and he then lived in Marle Place until 1969 and where his daughter continues to live now. From the mid-1950s onwards, his books became more conventional, full of exotic settings, stirring action sequences and stock characters. In 1965 he began a series of four books featuring a private detective called Rex Carver, and these were among his most successful in sales terms.

Some time at the end of the 1960s, he began an affair with Diana Bird, the estranged wife of a solicitor living in the area, which led to his separation from Phyllis and leaving the family home in 1969 to settle in Devon. He had to wait five years for his divorce, and finally married Diana Bird in 1974. She died in February 1976. The six and a half years that they lived together were an extraordinarily productive period for him, containing almost all of his best work, including the first five of his &#x27;Birdcage&#x27; novels, a trilogy of books for children starting with &quot;The Runaways&quot;, and the beginning of a trilogy retelling the legends of King Arthur, &quot;The Crimson Chalice&quot;.

Canning married Adria Irving-Bell in November 1976, and they moved to Gloucestershire and then Herefordshire, then back to Gloucestershire. He continued writing a book a year, and started to write radio plays, of which three were broadcast. He died in Cirencester, Gloucestershire in 1986, aged 74. His last book, &quot;Table Number Seven&quot;, was completed by his wife Adria and his sister Jean. Adria Canning continued to live in Cirencester. She died there in 1986.

Canning seems to have been a generous and friendly man, an accomplished sportsman, keen on golf and latterly on fishing, as attested by his daughter (personal interview), the many descriptions of fishing in the books and stories after 1968, and by his dedicating a book to the cartoonist Alex Graham as his golfing partner. His love of and knowledge of English countryside and wildlife pervades his early and late work. His middle period thrillers are mainly set overseas since &quot;in England you can always call a policeman&quot;, as he is reported to have said. In contrast, the &#x27;Birdcage&#x27; books, beginning with &quot;Firecrest&quot; (1971) and including his masterpiece &quot;The Rainbird Pattern&quot; (1972) which was awarded the CWA Silver Dagger and nominated for the Edgar awards, were all far darker and more realistic than any of his earlier thrillers. They do not have conventional happy endings. The settings are mostly in the south of England, and the villains are often sinister government officials who crush the innocent bystanders who might expose them.

<doc id="759307" wikidata="Q583302" url="?curid=759307" title="To Bring You My Love">
<text>To Bring You My Love is the third studio album by the English alternative rock musician PJ Harvey, released on 27 February 1995 by Island Records. Recorded after the break-up of the PJ Harvey trio, it stands as her first proper solo album. The songs on the album are heavily influenced by American blues music.

Harvey co-produced the record with Flood and John Parish. &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; would be the first of Harvey&#x27;s many collaborations with Flood and Parish. The music on the album was played largely by Harvey and Parish, with contributions from seasoned musicians Joe Gore, Mick Harvey, Jean-Marc Butty, and others. Many of the musicians who appeared on the album joined Harvey on tour to support it in 1995.

&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; is considered to be PJ Harvey&#x27;s breakthrough. It garnered massive critical acclaim worldwide and became her best-selling studio album. The single &quot;Down by the Water&quot; received extensive airplay on radio and on MTV. The album was placed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s original list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Background and history==
PJ Harvey took a break from the spotlight in 1994. After releasing two studio albums (&quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid of Me&quot;) and a compilation (&quot;4-Track Demos&quot;) in less than two years, she kept a low profile for most of the year. Harvey made only one public appearance in 1994, performing a cover version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; with Icelandic singer Björk at the annual BRIT Awards.

Using the royalties that she had received from her first two studio albums, she bought a house in rural England close to her parents&#x27; home in Yeovil. She described her new home as &quot;completely in the countryside. I have no neighbours. When I look out the window, all I see are fields.&quot; Living in near isolation, she began writing the songs that would appear on &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; was Harvey&#x27;s first album of new material since disbanding the original PJ Harvey trio in 1993. For this recording she recruited producer Flood, her old Automatic Dlamini bandmate John Parish and a new line-up of session musicians including multi-instrumentalists Joe Gore, Eric Drew Feldman, Mick Harvey and drummer Jean-Marc Butty. She herself played guitar, keyboards, vibraphone and bells on the record, as well as co-producing it with Flood and John Parish.

==Music and lyrics==

The subject matter and tone of the songs on &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; differ somewhat from what Harvey had presented on her earlier albums. The songs on &quot;Rid of Me&quot; (1993), for example, are more aggressive in their depictions of relationships. They focus more on revenge (&quot;Rid of Me&quot;, &quot;Rub &#x27;til It Bleeds&quot;), or act as an attack on traditional masculinity (&quot;Man-Size&quot;, &quot;50ft Queenie&quot;, &quot;Me-Jane&quot;). Although these songs do directly consider longing and loss, many of the songs on &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; focus particularly on these topics, specifically considering the loss of, or longing for, a departed lover. The title track presents a narrator who not only desires love but is willing to sacrifice everything to get it. &quot;I&#x27;ve lain with the devil,&quot; Harvey sings, &quot;Cursed God above/Forsaken Heaven/To bring you my love.&quot;

Many of the songs on &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; employ biblical imagery such as Heaven, God, and Jesus Christ. Harvey, however, is not a religious person. She was not baptized and did not attend church as a child. She spoke of her use of religious imagery by saying &quot;I look towards religion as possibly one means to finding an answer, to making sense why we&#x27;re here. That&#x27;s what drives the creative force, to make sense of one&#x27;s life. A very natural place to look is in that divine area, because it&#x27;s so strong and has been here long before us.&quot;

With the exception of two tracks (&quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; and &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot;) the album is considered much softer musically than her previous studio albums.

Many references are made to one of Harvey&#x27;s major influences, Captain Beefheart. The opening line of the album, &quot;I was born in the desert&quot;, is also the opening line of Beefheart&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; (1967). The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot;, is a direct response (from the perspective of one of the &quot;young girls&quot; invited to meet the monster) to Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Tropical Hot Dog Night&quot;, the second track of his 1978 album &quot;Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)&quot;, an album which Harvey has said had a particular impact on her. A lyrical and melodic resemblance to Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; is also found on the track &quot;I Think I&#x27;m a Mother,&quot; and the vocal melody at the end of Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Teclo&quot; (&quot;Let me ride on his grace for a while...&quot;) seems to mirror Beefheart&#x27;s melody in &quot;Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles&quot;.

Musically, the album is more complicated than &quot;Dry&quot; or &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. Two guitar parts are used in many of the songs, in most cases played by Harvey and Parish. Acoustic guitar and strings, used sparingly in her previous releases, can be heard throughout &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;. Bells, chimes, and a vibraphone add to the atmosphere of the recording. Keyboards and organ are also used extensively, a result of much of the album being composed on a Yamaha keyboard Harvey bought second-hand. The deep, rumbling organ tones provide many of the lower notes on the album, replacing traditional basslines.

==Critical reception==

As her second full-length release on a major label, &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; received a heavy promotional push from Island Records. Extensive MTV rotation and college radio airplay for the first single &quot;Down by the Water&quot; — with its eccentric, eye-catching Maria Mochnacz-directed music video of Harvey drowning in an emerald pond while wearing an extravagant wig, heavy make-up and a slinky red satin evening gown — gave Harvey her biggest radio hit to date, reaching number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock chart. The album itself debuted at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 12 in the UK, and went on to sell roughly one million copies. The moderate commercial breakthrough of &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; had nothing to do with any scaling-down of her trademark lyrical intensity: the infanticide fable &quot;Down by the Water&quot; — whose whispered coda of &quot;Little fish big fish swimming in the water/Come back here, man, gimme my daughter&quot; references the old Lead Belly blues standard &quot;Salty Dog&quot; — ostensibly deals with a mother drowning her child.

The critical response was overwhelmingly positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the record as &quot;astonishing&quot; in its four-star review. &quot;The Independent&quot; shared the same point of view, writing that Harvey&#x27;s performance &quot;make[s] the record stand out from its peers&quot;; reviewer Nicholas Barber saw it as &quot;a threatening, nightmarish creature&quot;, adding &quot;imagine Siouxsie and the Bad Seeds&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted the &quot;rich imagery&quot; of the lyrics, writing that &quot;in the most gripping moments, [...] [Harvey] speaks with the captivating clarity and force of someone reaching for a final, life-saving anchor.&quot;

==Accolades==
The album received universal acclaim. It was voted as the best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll by a wide margin, and was also voted the year&#x27;s number-one album by publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Hot Press&quot; and, in &quot;the biggest landslide victory in 15 years&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It featured in Top Ten lists for magazines like &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot;, though a contrarian &quot;Time&quot; list dubbed it the &quot;Worst Album of 1995.&quot; The album received two Grammy Award nominations as Best Alternative Music Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Down by the Water&quot;, and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. &quot;Spin&quot; later ranked it at number three in a list of the best albums of the 1990s. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 435 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, in 2011, rated &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; as the 20th best album of the 1990s. As of December 2005, (according to AskBillboard) &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; has sold 371,000 copies in the US.

<text>Data management comprises all disciplines related to handling data as a valuable resource, it is the practice of managing an organization&#x27;s data so it can be analyzed for decision making.

==Concept==

The concept of data management arose in the 1980s as technology moved from sequential processing (first punched cards, then magnetic tape) to random access storage.

Since it was now possible to store a discrete fact and quickly access it using random access disk technology, those suggesting that data management was more important than business process management used arguments such as &quot;a customer&#x27;s home address is stored in 75 (or some other large number) places in our computer systems.&quot; However, during this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting &quot;process management&quot; was more important than &quot;data management&quot; used batch processing time as their primary argument.

As application software evolved into real-time, interactive usage, it became obvious that both management processes were important. If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process wasn&#x27;t well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.

== Patterns ==
Followings are common data management patterns:

* Cache-aside
* command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) 
* Event sourcing
* Index table
* Materialized view
* Sharding
* Valet key
* Static content hosting

==Usage==

In modern management usage, the term &quot;data&quot; is increasingly replaced by &quot;information&quot; or even &quot;knowledge&quot; in a non-technical context. Thus data management has become information management or knowledge management. This trend obscures the raw data processing and renders interpretation implicit. The distinction between data and derived value is illustrated by the information ladder.
However, data has staged a comeback with the popularisation of the term big data, which refers to the collection and analyses of massive sets of data. While big data is a recent phenomenon, the requirement for data to aid decision-making traces back to the early 1970s with the emergence of decision support systems (DSS). These systems can be considered as the initial iteration of data management for decision support.

Several organisations have established data management centers (DMC) for their operations.

==Data sources==
Marketers and marketing organizations have been using data collection and analysis to refine their operations for the last few decades. Marketing departments in organizations and marketing companies conduct data collection and analysis by collecting data from different data sources and analyzing them to come up with insightful data they can use for strategic decision-making (Baier et al., 2012). In the modern business environment, data has evolved into a crucial asset for businesses since businesses use data as a strategic asset that is used regularly to create a competitive advantage and improve customer experiences. Among the most significant forms of data is customer information which is a critical asset used to assess customer behavior and trends and use it for developing new strategies for improving customer experience (Ahmed, 2004). However, data has to be of high quality to be used as a business asset for creating a competitive advantage. Therefore, data governance is a critical element of data collection and analysis since it determines the quality of data while integrity constraints guarantee the reliability of information collected from data sources. Various technologies including Big Data are used by businesses and organizations to allow users to search for specific information from raw data by grouping it based on the preferred criteria marketing departments in organizations could apply for developing targeted marketing strategies (Ahmed, 2004). As technology evolves, new forms of data are being introduced for analysis and classification purposes in marketing organizations and businesses. The introduction of new gadgets such as Smartphones and new-generation PCs has also introduced new data sources from which organizations can collect, analyze and classify data when developing marketing strategies. Retail businesses are the business category that uses customer data from smart devices and websites to understand how their current and targeted customers perceive their services before using the information to make improvements and increase customer satisfaction (Cerchiello and Guidici, 2012). Analyzing customer data is crucial for businesses since it allows marketing teams to understand customer behavior and trends which makes a considerable difference during the development of new marketing campaigns and strategies. Retailers who use customer data from various sources gain an advantage in the market since they can develop data-informed strategies for attracting and retaining customers in the overly competitive business environment. Based on the information on the benefits of data collection and analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed: The sources of data used as the foundation of data collection and analysis have a considerable impact on the data analysis tools used for analyzing and categorizing data.

== Data analysis tools ==
Organizations use various data analysis tools for discovering unknown information and insights from huge databases; this allows organizations to discover new patterns that were not known to them or extract buried information before using it to come up with new patterns and relationships (Ahmed, 2004). There are 2 main categories of data analysis tools, data mining tools and data profiling tools. Also, most commercial data analysis tools are used by organizations for extracting, transforming and loading ETL for data warehouses in a manner that ensures no element is left out during the process (Turban et al., 2008). Thus the data analysis tools are used for supporting the 3 Vs in Big Data: volume, variety and velocity. Factor velocity emerged in the 1980s as one of the most important procedures in data analysis tools which was widely used by organizations for market research. The tools used to select core variables from the data that was collected from various sources and analyzed it; if the amount of data used to be too huge for humans to understand via manual observation, factor analysis would be introduced to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative data (Stewart, 1981). Organizations collect data from numerous sources including websites, emails and customer devices before conducting data analysis. Collecting data from numerous sources and analyzing it using different data analysis tools has its advantages, including overcoming the risk of method bias; using data from different sources and analyzing it using multiple analysis methods guarantees businesses and organizations robust and reliable findings they can use in decision making. On the other hand, researchers use modern technologies to analyze and group data collected from respondents in the form of images, audio and video files by applying algorithms and other analysis software Berry et al., 1997). Researchers and marketers can then use the information obtained from the new generation analysis tools and methods for forecasting, decision support and making estimations for decision making. For instance, information from different data sources on demand forecasts can help a retail business determine the amount of stock required in an upcoming season depending on data from previous seasons. The analysis can allow organizations to make data-informed decisions to gain competitive advantage in an era where all businesses and organizations are capitalizing on emerging technologies and business intelligence tools to gain competitive edges. While there are numerous analysis tools in the market, Big Data analytics is the most common and advanced technology that has led to the following hypothesis: Data analytic tools used to analyze data collected from numerous data sources determine the quality and reliability of data analysis.

==Data security and data privacy==
While organizations need to use quality data collection and analysis tools to guarantee the quality and reliability of the customer data they collect, they must implement security and privacy strategies to protect the data and customer information from privacy leaks (Van Till, 2013). A study conducted by PWC indicated that more than two-thirds of retail customers prefer purchasing products and services from businesses that have data protection and privacy plans for protecting customer information. Also, the study indicated that customers trust businesses that can prove they cannot use customer data for any other purposes other than marketing. As technology and the Internet continue improving, the success of businesses using it as a platform for marketing their products will depend on how effectively they can gain and maintain the trust of customers and users. Therefore, businesses will have to introduce and implement effective data protection and privacy strategies to protect business data and customer privacy. Although developing trust between customers and businesses affects the customers’ purchasing intentions, it also has a considerable impact on long-term purchasing behaviors including how frequently customers purchase which could impact the profitability of a business in the long run. Thus, the above information leads to the following hypothesis: Implementing data security and privacy plans has a positive impact on economic and financial outcomes.

==Financial and economic outcomes==
Studies indicate that customer transactions account for a 40% increase in the data collected annually, which means that financial data has a considerable impact on business decisions. Therefore, modern organizations are using big data analytics to identify 5 to 10 new data sources that can help them collect and analyze data for improved decision-making. Jonsen (2013) explains that organizations using average analytics technologies are 20% more likely to gain higher returns compared to their competitors who have not introduced any analytics capabilities in their operations. Also, IRI reported that the retail industry could experience an increase of more than $10 billion each year resulting from the implementation of modern analytics technologies. Therefore, the following hypothesis can be proposed: Economic and financial outcomes can impact how organizations use data analytics tools.

<text>The Zimbabwe men&#x27;s national cricket team, also known as the Chevrons, represents Zimbabwe in men&#x27;s international cricket and is overseen by Zimbabwe Cricket (formerly known as the Zimbabwe Cricket Union). Zimbabwe has been a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1992. As of May, 2023, Zimbabwe was ranked 10th in Tests, 11th in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 11th in Twenty20 internationals (T20Is) by the ICC.

==History==

===Before Test status===


Zimbabwe – known as Rhodesia until 1980 – had a national cricket team before it achieved Test status.

A summary of key moments:

* Rhodesia was represented in the South African domestic cricket tournament, the Currie Cup, sporadically from 1904 to 1932, and then regularly from 1946 until independence.
* Following independence, the country began to play more international cricket.
* On 21 July 1981, Zimbabwe became an associate member of the ICC.
* Zimbabwe participated in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, as well as the 1987 and 1992 events.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s first World Cup campaign in 1983 ended in the group stage, as they lost five of their six matches. However, they threw a surprise against Australia. Batting first, Zimbabwe reached a total of 239 for 6 in the allotted 60 overs, with skipper Duncan Fletcher top-scoring with 69 not out. Fletcher then produced career-best figures of 4 for 42 to restrict Australia to 226 for 7, thereby recording a stunning upset in cricket history.

In the 1987 World Cup, Zimbabwe lost all six of their group-stage matches, though they came very close to winning against New Zealand. Chasing 243 to win from 50 overs, wicketkeeper-batsman David Houghton scored 142, but Zimbabwe were all out for 239 in the final over, thus losing by three runs.

In the 1992 tournament, Zimbabwe failed to progress beyond the round-robin stage, losing seven of their eight matches, though there were two notable achievements. Against Sri Lanka in their first match, Zimbabwe posted their then-highest total of 312 for 4, with wicketkeeper-batsman Andy Flower top-scoring with 115 not out. However, the Sri Lankans chased this total down with four balls to spare, winning by three wickets.

In their final match, Zimbabwe faced England in an inconsequential encounter, England having already made the semi-finals. Batting first, Zimbabwe were all out for 134. Eddo Brandes then produced a stunning spell of 4 for 21, including dismissing Graham Gooch the first ball, to help restrict England to 125 all out and thus give Zimbabwe a shock nine-run victory.

These twenty World Cup matches were Zimbabwe&#x27;s only international games during this period.

===1992–1996: early years of Test status===
Zimbabwe was granted Test status by the ICC in July 1992 and played its first Test match in October that year, against India at Harare Sports Club. They became the ninth Test nation.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s early Test performances were consistently weak, leading to suggestions that they had been granted Test status prematurely. Of their first 30 Test matches, they won just one, at home against Pakistan in early 1995.

In the one-day arena, however, the team soon became competitive, if not particularly strong. In particular, world respect was gained for their fielding ability.

===1997–2002: the golden era===
Despite his team&#x27;s difficulties, wicket-keeper/batsman Andy Flower was at one point rated the best batsman in world cricket. During this era, Zimbabwe also produced such cricketers as Flower&#x27;s brother Grant, and allrounders Andy Blignaut and Heath Streak (who was later appointed national captain). Murray Goodwin was also a world-class batsman; following his retirement from international cricket, he has scored heavily for Sussex. Another world-class batsman was David Houghton, who holds the record for the highest individual Test score for Zimbabwe of 266 against Sri Lanka in 1994/95. Sometime captain and middle-order batsman Alistair Campbell, leg-spinning all-rounder Paul Strang, Eddo Brandes, and pace bowler/opener Neil Johnson were other important contributors for Zimbabwe on the world stage at this time.

With the appearance of these quality players, a breakthrough was achieved in levels of performance in the late 1990s where the Zimbabwean team began winning Tests against other nations, which included a series win against Pakistan. Unfortunately, the political situation in Zimbabwe declined at around the same time, which had a detrimental effect on the national team&#x27;s performances.

Zimbabwe performed well at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, coming in fifth place in the Super Sixes and only missing out on a semi-final place due to having an inferior net run-rate than New Zealand.

In the group stage, Zimbabwe beat India by three runs, before facing their neighbours South Africa, then the best team in the world. Batting first, Zimbabwe made 233 for 6, with a well-fought 76 by opening batsman Neil Johnson. In reply, South Africa collapsed to 40 for 6, before Lance Klusener and Shaun Pollock scored half-centuries to reduce the margin of defeat to 48 runs. This was South Africa&#x27;s first defeat against Zimbabwe and one of Zimbabwe&#x27;s most famous wins. Neil Johnson also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets and claiming the Man of the Match award. Johnson quit playing for Zimbabwe after this tournament.

During this period, Zimbabwe beat all Test-playing nations (except Australia ,India) regularly in ODI series. Zimbabwe beat New Zealand both home and away in 2000–2001. The team also reached the finals of many multi-national one-day tournaments.

===2003–2004: signs of decline===

The increasing politicization of cricket, including selectorial policy, along with the declining situation in Zimbabwe disrupted the 2003 Cricket World Cup, which was jointly hosted by Zimbabwe, Kenya and South Africa. England forfeited a match scheduled to be played in Zimbabwe, risking their own progress through the competition, citing &quot;security concerns&quot; as their reason. Zimbabwean players Andy Flower and fast bowler Henry Olonga wore black armbands, for &quot;mourning the death of democracy&quot; in Zimbabwe. Both were immediately dismissed from the team and applied for political asylum overseas. This public political protest caused considerable embarrassment to the co-hosts and disrupted team harmony. Since the 2003 World Cup, with a succession of Zimbabwe&#x27;s best players ending their international careers early, a new side began to develop, featuring the likes of Travis Friend, Andy Blignaut, Hamilton Masakadza, Douglas Hondo, Craig Wishart, Ray Price, Sean Ervine, Mark Vermeulen, Tatenda Taibu, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Dougie Marillier, and Barney Rogers. Whilst not of the same caliber of Streak, Goodwin, and the Flower brothers, this new breed of predominantly multi-disciplined players formed a solid backbone to a competitive, if usually unsuccessful, side.

In late 2003, Zimbabwe toured Australia in a two-match series. The series was more memorable for Australian opener Matthew Hayden&#x27;s innings in the first Test – in which he overcame a back strain to score a then record 380 runs – than for the Zimbabwean performance.

Zimbabwe lost its first match against Bangladesh in 2004. In 2004, captain Heath Streak was sacked by the ZCU (now Zimbabwe Cricket), prompting a walkout by 14 other players in protest against political influence in the team&#x27;s management and selection policies. A scheduled tour by Sri Lanka went ahead, but this was a lopsided affair, with Zimbabwe represented by fringe players who were not of international standard. Because of this, the ZCU accepted that Zimbabwe was to play no further Test cricket in 2004, though its status as a Test nation remained unaffected.

===2005–2009: worsening political situation, steep decline and the exodus of players===

After a series of poor Test performances following the resignation of several senior players, the Zimbabwean team was voluntarily suspended from Test cricket in late 2005 by its cricket board, with ICC encouragement.

In early 2005, Heath Streak was reinstated into the national side, but the political situation in Zimbabwe involving Operation Murambatsvina disrupted the Zimbabwean team. During overseas tours, the players were often said to be buying necessities that were unavailable – or prohibitively expensive – at home, as opposed to the souvenirs which other touring teams would purchase.

In 2005 an agreement was signed which led to the return of many of the rebels to the Zimbabwe side. However, results failed to improve as in March Zimbabwe lost both their Tests on tour against South Africa by an innings. Worse was to follow in August, when they were crushed on home soil by New Zealand, in a match that was completed in just two days. In the process, Zimbabwe was humiliated; they became only the second side in Test history (after India in 1952) to be bowled out twice in the space of one day. Then they lost both their Tests to India at home later in September. After the series against India, Streak announced his retirement from international cricket, dealing yet another blow to the beleaguered team.

By November 2005, the players were once again in dispute with Zimbabwe Cricket over political interference in the management of the game, as well as contract negotiations, and the new captain, Tatenda Taibu, resigned from international cricket. By then the team had been further weakened by the departure of the likes of Dougie Marillier, Craig Wishart and Sean Ervine, all of whom retired in protest and expressed disillusionment in the local cricket hierarchy.

By January 2006, 37 Zimbabwean cricketers had failed to receive any offer of renegotiation talks from Zimbabwe Cricket after their contracts with the board had expired. This body of players demanded that the chairman and managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, Peter Chingoka and Ozias Bvute, be removed from office for there to be any hope for the players to return to the international stage.

On 6 January 2006, the Sports and Recreation Commission, a division of the Zimbabwean government, took over the offices of Zimbabwe Cricket. The apparent takeover has resulted in the firing of all whites and Asians among the board directors, because of &quot;their racial connotations and saving their own agendas and not government policy&quot; according to Gibson Mashingaidze, an army brigadier and chairman of the government&#x27;s Sports and Recreation Commission.

An interim board was appointed as the new leading party of cricket in Zimbabwe, with Peter Chingoka appointed as the committee&#x27;s head. Given Chingoka&#x27;s close ties to Bvute, it was likely that the latter would continue in his post as well.

On 18 January 2006, Zimbabwe Cricket announced that they were suspending the playing of Test cricket for the rest of the year. Zimbabwe&#x27;s coach Kevin Curran said that Zimbabwe were aiming to play their next Test against the West Indies in November 2007. It was felt by observers that the Zimbabwean national team was not of sufficient Test standard, and that competing against Full Member sides would do little to improve standards, given the likely one-sided nature of the games. Bangladesh, for a long time seen as the &#x27;whipping boys&#x27; of Test cricket, recorded their first win against Zimbabwe, and were thereafter regarded as being of a superior standard. On 8 August 2011, Zimbabwe recorded a resounding victory in the one Test match series over Bangladesh, played in Harare.

Domestically, the Logan Cup – Zimbabwe&#x27;s first-class competition played amongst the provinces – was canceled in 2006 for the first time since its inception over a century ago (though the Cup was not played during some of the years of the World Wars). This was widely seen due to concern by ZC that the standard of play would be so poor as to be both not worthwhile and potentially harmful to the external image of cricket in Zimbabwe. The one-day trophy, the Faithwear Cup, was contested and drew complaints from observers that the quality was less than club level. As well as player exodus, the main reason for this catastrophic fall in standards was put down to wrangling within Zimbabwe Cricket, where internal politics motivated the removal of the historic provinces and their replacement with revamped, newly designated provincial teams. Zimbabwe&#x27;s economic collapse led to scanty attendance at games and players not receiving their salaries for long periods of time.

In a further harmful incident, ex-player Mark Vermeulen was arrested after attempting to burn down ZC&#x27;s offices, and successfully destroying the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy&#x27;s premises. In a nation in increasing social and economic turmoil, such facilities are hard to replace, and their loss has proven difficult to manage for a cricket administration already short of top-quality facilities.

In the period leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, and to stop a similar exodus of players as after the 2003 World Cup, the selected players were asked to sign a new contract. The players were summoned to meet Ozias Bvute, Zimbabwe Cricket&#x27;s managing director, a week or so before they were due to set off and given an ultimatum – sign the contract on offer or be removed from the squad. It is understood that they were not allowed to take advice, and were told they had to make the decision then and there.

One player told his teammates that there were certain things contained in the contracts that needed clarification. He was summoned back into Bvute&#x27;s office and warned that it was a take-it-or-leave-it offer: this player was later revealed to be Anthony Ireland. Another said that when he told Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute picked up the phone and called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, and told him he wanted the player replaced in the squad. Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.

In light of the poor state of Zimbabwe&#x27;s finances, and that Zimbabwe Cricket had to borrow around US$1  million in early 2007 pending receipt of monies from the World Cup to help them over an ongoing cash crisis, the board agreed to pay match fees in US dollars. The players were to be paid US$2000 per appearance and a series of US$500 bonuses based on wickets taken and fifties scored. The maximum payment was believed to be capped at around US$8000. However, fees were not paid until June 2007 to stop the exodus and help cash flow.

The specter of continued problems with the ZC board influenced some players to cut their losses and seek to finish their careers abroad: Anthony Ireland accepted a contract to play for Gloucestershire during 2007, while opener Vusi Sibanda also left. More are thought to be considering following suit.

Zimbabwe fared poorly in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, even failing to beat non-Test playing Ireland.

Zimbabwe upset Australia in its opening match of the Twenty20 World Championship in Cape Town, defeating them by 5 wickets. Brendan Taylor led the way for Zimbabwe, with first-class wicket keeping (a catch, stumping, and run out) and a crucial unbeaten 60 from 45 deliveries. He was announced as Man of the Match. They then lost to England by 50 runs, meaning they exited the tournament at the first stage due to their net run rate being inferior to both Australia and England after Australia had beaten England in the other group match.

There was more encouraging news in October 2007, when it was announced that Zimbabwe would compete in all three domestic competitions in South Africa as part of Cricket South Africa&#x27;s attempts to improve the standard of cricket in Zimbabwe.

However, their participation in the above competitions was thrown into doubt when the plans were postponed pending a Cricket South Africa board meeting. A compromise was reached late in November 2007, meaning Zimbabwe would have taken part in the MTN Domestic Championship and the Standard Bank Pro 20 Series, but not the SuperSport Series as originally planned. Instead, they played three first-class four-day games against a South African Composite XI made up of franchise and provincial players. The three games, in Paarl, Potchefstroom, and Kimberley were all won by Zimbabwe.

In between those games, they played a five match One Day International series against the West Indies, scoring an upset win in the opening match before losing the series 3–1. The final match was abandoned due to rain.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s performance against Bangladesh during this time was extremely poor as they lost every ODI series except one at home, including a 0–5 whitewash in 2006.

Zimbabwe also lost against non-Test playing nation Kenya very often. But in 2009, they bounced back beating their African neighbors 9–1 in ten games.

===2010–2013: return to Tests and continued financial problems===
Zimbabwe won an ODI and a T20I during their tour of the West Indies. Zimbabwe reached the finals of a triangular tournament that included India and Sri Lanka. They lost their remaining matches in the year except against Ireland whom they beat 2–1 at home.

Zimbabwe started their World Cup 2011 campaign with a 91-run defeat by Australia at Ahmadabad on 21 February 2011. They then recorded a comfortable victory over Canada, before losing by 10 wickets to New Zealand on 4 March 2011. Further heavy defeats by Sri Lanka and Pakistan followed, before a consolation victory over Kenya was achieved in Zimbabwe&#x27;s final game of the tournament. After these defeats, opening batsman Brendan Taylor was announced as captain of all formats on 24 June 2011, replacing Elton Chigumbura.

Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket on 4 August 2011 after a six-year exile, hosting Bangladesh in a one-off Test match at Harare. The national team&#x27;s re-introduction to Test cricket was successful, as they won by 130 runs.

As part of the lead-up to their Test return, Zimbabwe Cricket announced major upgrades to the Harare Sports Club and Mutare Sports Club grounds. Plans for a new Test ground at Victoria Falls were also revealed. ZC also signed a US$1 million deal with Reebok to sponsor the domestic competitions and manufacture the kits of the national team for three years.

Following the Test, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh contested a five-match ODI series. Zimbabwe won 3–2, thus recording their first ODI series win against a Test-playing nation since 2006.

Zimbabwe was beaten in all the formats by Pakistan. After this they played a home series with New Zealand. They were defeated 2–0 in the T20I series, and New Zealand was 2–0 up in the ODI series. The final ODI was being played at the Queen&#x27;s Sports Club, Bulawayo. They were on a 12-match losing streak at that time.

Furthermore, when batting first, New Zealand scored 328 in 50 overs, nobody gave Zimbabwe a chance of winning. The Zimbabweans have never chased an ODI total over 300 before. However, they did it successfully for the first time in their history.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s main aim in the innings break was to lose with dignity. When opener Vusi Sibanda was out for a duck, even that seemed to be a tall order, but skipper Brendan Taylor changed the entire complexion of the match. Taylor scored a brilliant 75 before he was dismissed fresh from the centuries he scored from the last games.

After Taylor&#x27;s dismissal, Tatenda Taibu&#x27;s speedy fifty kept Zimbabwe in the hunt. However, the match-changing partnership was between the two all-rounders Malcolm Waller and Elton Chigumbura. Waller played one of the greatest innings in ODI history as he scored 99*. In the end, he even did not think of his century, but to just take his team over the line. His unselfishness brought about for Zimbabwe a much-needed victory. His partner Chigumbura scored a brisk 47 and was quite unlucky to miss out on his half-century, bowled by Jacob Oram after he along with Waller had taken the equation below a run a ball. When Keegan Meth was bowled two balls later for a duck, Waller kept his cool as he marshaled the middle order efficiently, assisted by a six by debutant Natsai Mushangwe, and then enough support by Ray Price brought the scores level. After Price was dismissed (caught), it was the last wicket Zimbabwe had and the new man in was another debutant Njabulo Ncube. Waller is said to have advised him, &quot;&#x27;No matter what happens if I get bat on the ball, let&#x27;s take the run.&#x27; And the run they did take, thereby recording a legendary victory for Zimbabwe. According to an interview later, Waller said that he was thinking of a swing and get the ball over the ground so that both his team could win and he could get a century, but later he thought that he would rather take the team home rather than get 100,&quot;. Waller was the Man of the Match for his spectacular performance, while Brendan Taylor was Man of the Series.

Zimbabwe came close to winning the solitary Test between the teams. Chasing 366 to win in their second innings, Zimbabwe were well placed at 265 for 3, with Taylor making 117, before a collapse handed New Zealand a 34-run victory.

Zimbabwe then toured New Zealand in January and February 2012 for a single-Test, three-ODI and two-T20I series, but lost all six matches. In the Test, they were bowled out twice on the third day – for 51 (their lowest Test score) and 143 – to lose by an innings and 301 runs.

In June 2012, Zimbabwe beat South Africa in a t20 match of an unofficial triangular T20 tournament where Bangladesh national cricket team also featured. This was the 3rd match of the tournament. They beat South Africa by 29 runs. They also had beaten Bangladesh in the first match of that tournament by 10 runs. In the 3rd match against South Africa, although there were no AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis, the South Africa team was very much strong. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza opened the innings and scored 58 and 55 respectively. The wicket-keeper captain Brendan Taylor scored a quickfire 38 from 21 balls in the end. They scored 176/4 in 20 overs. Coming to chase, South African batsmen Richard Levi and Colin Ingram scored 40 and 48 respectively. But the other batsmen struggle to make it and went all out on 147 within 19.2 overs. Christopher Mpofu took 3 for 20. In the next meetings with South Africa and Bangladesh, Zimbabwe lost both of the matches and ended in the same points as those of South Africa and Bangladesh. Due to better net run rates, Zimbabwe and South Africa progressed to the final. On 24 June 2012, in the final match, South Africa batted first and scored 146 runs with the loss of 6 wickets in 20 overs. While an early collapse occurred in their innings, South Africa managed to get back with a fair score as Faf du Plessis scored 66 off 57 balls and Albie Morkel scored a quickfire 34 not out off 23 balls. Kyle Jarvis of Zimbabwe took 2 wickets for 22 runs. coming out to chase, Zimbabwe started well but Vusi Sibanda went out on 24 off 16. But then the captain Brendan Taylor and Hamilton Masakadza well built the innings scoring 59 not out and 58 not out respectively. They took Zimbabwe to victory as they scored 150 for the loss of 1 wicket in 17.1 overs. Zimbabwe won by 9 wickets and clinched the T20 series in front of a full house packed with native Zimbabwean crowd at the Harare Sports Club ground. Brendan Taylor was the man of the match and Hamilton Masakadza got the man of the series award.

Zimbabwe lost all their matches in 2010 and 2012 World t20s in the opening stage.

Zimbabwe toured West Indies again in 2013. This time they were less successful and lost all matches.

Zimbabwe then hosted Bangladesh in June. They won the One Day International series 2–1 while the Test and T20I series were tied 1–1. They then lost an ODI series 0–5 at home to world champions India.

During August and September 2013, Zimbabwe hosted Pakistan in a two-Test, three-ODI and two-T20I series. Pakistan won both T20Is, before coming from behind to win the ODI series 2–1. They then won the first Test following a double-century by Younis Khan in the second innings. However, Zimbabwe won the second Test by 24 runs – their first Test victory against a team other than Bangladesh since 2001 – to draw the series 1–1.

Throughout the period, Zimbabwe&#x27;s financial condition deeply worsened. The ICC had to step in and provide financial assistance but the usage of monetary benefits has been a question of debate. Zimbabwe players have threatened boycott many times of late and have formed a players&#x27; Union. Zimbabwe team has struggled to attract sponsors and this has affected its domestic structure leading to cancellation of many tournaments such as &quot;Pro40&quot;. A number of franchises also have been cancelled. Multiple tours have been postponed, cancelled or have gone un-televised.

===2014–2021: fall in rankings, loss to associates, and failure to reach 2019 World Cup===

At the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, Zimbabwe was eliminated in the group stage. A last-ball defeat against Ireland was followed by victories over the Netherlands (also off the last ball) and the United Arab Emirates, but a resounding win for the Netherlands over Ireland meant that the Dutch progressed to the Super 10 stage on net run-rate.

In July 2014, Zimbabwe hosted Afghanistan in a four-ODI series. They won the first two matches, before the Afghans won the last two to draw the series. The following month, Zimbabwe hosted South Africa in a single-Test and three-ODI series, losing all four matches.

Following the South African tour, Australia arrived in Zimbabwe for a triangular ODI series with the hosts and South Africa. While Zimbabwe lost their first two matches, to Australia and South Africa respectively, they pulled off a significant upset by beating Australia in the 4th match of the series. This was the first time Zimbabwe had beaten Australia in 31 years, with their last win coming in the 1983 world cup in England. Despite this win, Zimbabwe lost their final match and were knocked out of the tournament.

In late 2014, Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh for a three-Test and five-ODI series. They lost all eight matches. Following this, Stephen Mangongo was sacked as coach. In late December 2014, Zimbabwe Cricket appointed Dav Whatmore as coach, replacing Mangongo.

Zimbabwe geared up for the 2015 Cricket World Cup by winning all games against Northern Districts XI before facing New Zealand in their first warm-up game. New Zealand were reduced to 157/7 before rain intervened. In the next game, Zimbabwe upset Sri Lanka by seven wickets. Zimbabwe lost their opening game to South Africa, following which they beat the United Arab Emirates before losing to West Indies. Zimbabwe then went on to lose a close encounter to Pakistan.

During the Pool B match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Sean Williams was caught by Ireland&#x27;s John Mooney in a close run chase. Mooney was extremely close to the boundary and eight different television replays were inconclusive as to whether his foot had touched the boundary rope. Meanwhile, Williams had walked and the umpires signaled him out. Zimbabwe went on to lose the game and was knocked out of the tournament as a result. In their last game, Zimbabwe lost to India. Zimbabwe finished their world cup campaign with just one win over UAE in the first round. Despite this, Zimbabwe turned out to be very competitive and suffered four of the closest losses in the preliminary round of the tournament.

During the tournament, Brendan Taylor announced his retirement from Zimbabwe cricket even as he finished the tournament with 433 runs and two centuries. At the finish of the tournament, Taylor was among the leading run-getters of the tournament.

In May 2015, Zimbabwe became the first team in six years to tour Pakistan. Zimbabwe lost the T20I series 0–2 and the ODI series by an identical margin. In July that year, Zimbabwe hosted India and lost the ODI series 0–3, while the T20I series was tied 1–1, which included Zimbabwe&#x27;s first T20I win in Harare.

Zimbabwe then hosted New Zealand in August for a three match ODI series and won the first game but went on to lose the series 1–2, as well as the lone T20I. Pakistan arrived in late September following a decision to postpone their tour. Pakistan won the T20Is 2–0 and the ODI series 2–1.

Following the series against Pakistan, Zimbabwe simultaneously hosted associates Ireland and Afghanistan in October. Zimbabwe beat Ireland 2–1 in ODIs. But, Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe 3–2 to win the ODI series. This was the first time an associate nation had beaten a full member in a bilateral series. Zimbabwe then went on to lose the T20I series 0–2 as well to Afghanistan. After series of losses within home soil, Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh in November. But, losses continued to attack Zimbabweans, where they lost the ODI series 0–3, while the T20Is were drawn 1–1.

At the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, Zimbabwe contested a five-ODI and two-T20I series against Afghanistan in the United Arab Emirates. They took the ODI series to the deciding match before losing 3–2, and lost both T20Is. Zimbabwe then toured Bangladesh for a four-T20I series which was drawn 2–2.

After Chigumbura stepped down as captain, Hamilton Masakadza was named skipper. During the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, Zimbabwe were knocked out in the first round after they lost to Afghanistan by 59 runs.

Zimbabwe axed coach Whatmore and captain Hamilton Masakadza before the India tour in mid-2016. Makhaya Ntini the bowling coach was given interim responsibility of coaching while previously appointed vice-captain Graeme Cremer who had missed the ICC World Twenty20 2016 was appointed stand-in captain. Lance Klusener was appointed batting coach on a full-time basis.

India toured Zimbabwe for the fourth time in about six years for a three ODI and three t20I series. Indian selectors rested most of its senior players except for skipper MS Dhoni who visited the country for the first time in the decade. Zimbabwe was thrashed 0–3 in the ODI series which led to angry reactions by the fans. To add injury to insult, several key Zimbabwe players like Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Vusi Sibanda, Luke Jongwe, Richmond Mutumbami and Tinashe Panyangara were injured before or during the t20 series. Despite this, Zimbabwe managed to win the first T20I by two runs before going down meekly in the second. The series remained tied 1–1 after two games. In the last game, Zimbabwe went down fighting by 3 runs to lose the series 1–2. In 2016 season, New Zealand toured Zimbabwe in late July and won both tests convincingly, recorded as the Zimbabwe&#x27;s sixth straight loss to Kiwis.

Before the Sri Lanka tour on late September, Streak was appointed as head coach of Zimbabwe, with Ntini appointed as bowling coach. The task was given to qualify for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup and go up through the ranks in coming years. Zimbabwe played their 100th Test match on 29 October 2016 against Sri Lanka, but lost the match by 225 runs in the last hour of the fifth day after a fighting innings by skipper Graeme Cremer. Zimbabwe went on to lose the two match series 0–2.

The test series was followed by a tri-series also featuring West Indies. Zimbabwe advanced to the finals with four different results – a loss, a tie, a no-result and a win. However, Zimbabwe lost the final to Sri Lanka by six wickets. In early 2017, Afghanistan again defeated Zimbabwe in the ODI series and won the series 3–2.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s next one day international series was against Scotland in the European country in mid 2017 which was tied 1–1.

After 15 years, Zimbabwe toured Sri Lanka for 5-ODIs and a single Test in late June 2017. In the first match against Sri Lanka at Galle on 30 June 2017, Zimbabwe recorded their first ODI win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka, which is also recorded as their first win in any format against them within Sri Lanka. Solomon Mire scored a match-winning century and Zimbabwe successfully chased 319, which was also recorded as the first successful chase over 300 on Sri Lankan soil.

Despite the opening win, Zimbabwe went on to lose the next two games but bounced back to win the fourth game in a rain-affected match. In the fifth game, Sri Lanka set Zimbabwe a total of 204 runs to chase with Sikandar Raza claiming a career-best 3/21. In reply, Zimbabwe was 137–1 thanks to Hamilton Masakadza&#x27;s 73 before a collapse saw them lose six wickets before reaching 175. Skipper Cremer joined Raza to score the remaining runs and Zimbabwe won with about 12 overs to spare.

Zimbabwe lost the following one-off test by 4 wickets, partly due to a controversial stumping decision on the fifth day of the test. Despite this, Zimbabwe team and especially coach Heath Streak were showered with praises on their return.

In October, former players Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis returned to the national team after a two-year hiatus to play in the two test match series against the West Indies.

Zimbabwe lost the first match and the two test series 0–1 to West Indies. However, their draw in the second game was their first in over 12 years and they also earned their first points on the ICC rankings table while ending their ten-match losing streak.

Zimbabwe finished the year with an innings defeat within two days against South Africa in a rare four-day test.

Zimbabwe began 2018 with one win (against Sri Lanka) out of four games in a tri-series that involved hosts Bangladesh. They failed to qualify for the finals.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s next commitment was in the UAE where they again lost 0–2 to Afghanistan in a t20 series. This was followed by yet another ODI series defeat (1-4) against Afghanistan.
In March, Zimbabwe hosted nine other teams in the qualifiers for the 2019 ICC World Cup to decide the top two teams that will join the elite eight at cricket&#x27;s premier event to be held in England and Wales. Zimbabwe were placed in group B alongside Afghanistan, Nepal, Hong Kong and Scotland. Zimbabwe progressed to the super sixes by beating Nepal, Afghanistan and Hong Kong and earning a tie with Scotland. Zimbabwe beat Ireland in the first game of the super sixes but lost the second to West Indies. Needing to win their last game, Zimbabwe suffered a shock loss by 3 runs against UAE and were knocked out of the tournament. This was the first time Zimbabwe had failed to qualify for the Cricket World Cup.

With this failure, Zimbabwe Cricket sacked all the national coaching staff, national captain, under-19 coach and national selector from their positions. During a press conference, ZC suggested that Brendan Taylor would take over leadership of the team. In May 2018, ZC announced the appointment of Lalchand Rajput as interim head coach. In August 2018, he was confirmed as the permanent coach of the team.

In July 2018, Zimbabwe hosted Australia and Pakistan in a T20I tri-series. Zimbabwe players - Brendan Taylor, Graeme Cremer, Sean Williams, Craig Ervine and Sikandar Raza - refused to play after being not paid their salaries for about a year which resulted in a depleted Zimbabwe side losing their games heavily and getting knocked out in the first round. This was followed by a five-ODI series against Pakistan where Zimbabwe - further rattled by the losses of Malcolm Waller, Solomon Mire, and Kyle Jarvis - lost all five games by heavy margins.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s losing streak in international matches was extended to nineteen as the team lost the ODI series (0-3) and the t20I series (0-2) in South Africa in October and the ODI series (0-3) in Bangladesh in the same month. Zimbabwe put an end to the streak by winning the first test against Bangladesh by 151 runs. This was the Chevrons&#x27; first away win since 2001. The series was eventually tied 1-1.

2019 began on a bad note for Zimbabwe with Graeme Cremer putting his career on hold and proposed tours of India and Afghanistan being called off. Zimbabwe retained Hamilton Masakadza as skipper for all formats (despite the cricketer having not won a single limited overs match) while Peter Moor was named deputy. However, Masakadza along with Taylor missed the series against UAE due to injury. Moor captained the team in Masakadza&#x27;s absence. Under Moor, Zimbabwe recorded their first series clean sweep in over a decade by beating UAE 4–0.

Masakadza returned along with Taylor for Zimbabwe&#x27;s tour to the Netherlands. Zimbabwe lost the ODI series 0–2. After the Netherlands won the first t20i, the second game ended in a dramatic tie. Zimbabwe won the super over to tie the series 1-1. During the tour, Zimbabwe&#x27;s cricket board was suspended and was replaced by an interim board. Zimbabwe also lost the ODI series 0–3 in the subsequent tour of Ireland. The t20I series was tied 1-1.

ICC voluntarily suspended the Zimbabwe Cricket on 18 July 2019 from ICC tournaments citing political interventions in the Cricket Board of Zimbabwe. The decision taken by ICC panel left several players frustrated. Due to the ban, Zimbabwe could not compete in the qualifiers for 2020 ICC World Twenty20. Zimbabwe&#x27;s board was reinstated by their government soon after, but the suspension stayed. During the time, Solomon Mire and captain Hamilton Masakadza (under whom Zimbabwe had lost all 25 completed ODIs) announced their retirements.

Despite the suspension by the ICC, Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed that they would still be participating in the 2019–20 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, as they can still play against other ICC members. The tri-series started on 13 September, with the final scheduled to be held on 24 September. Masakadza&#x27;s last assignment led to Zimbabwe winning one game out of four and bowing out of the tournament.

Under new stand-in captain Sean Williams and missing many of their regular players, Zimbabwe toured Singapore to play in a final Tri-Nation Series also involving Nepal. Zimbabwe beat Nepal in the first game but lost to 21st ranked Singapore in the second. Zimbabwe won the next two games to register their first-ever series win in t20i format. In October 2019, the ICC lifted its suspension on Zimbabwe Cricket, allowing them to take part in future ICC events.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s first commitment of the year 2020 was a two-test home series against Sri Lanka which they lost 0–1. This was followed by a lone test and ODI series loss in Bangladesh. They lost the lone test in Sylhet by an innings and 106 runs. In the first ODI, thanks to a Liton Das century, they lost by a huge margin of 169 runs. The second ODI was a closer affair as Donald Tiripano&#x27;s incredible assault led to them causing a huge upset, but eventually, Zimbabwe lost by 4 runs. They were crushed by a 292 run partnership by the Bangladeshi openers and went on to lose by 123 runs. After the 0–3 loss, the two teams squared off for a two-game t20i series which Zimbabwe lost 0–2.

As of April 25, 2021 Zimbabwe had played 3 T20i matches against Pakistan marking a remarkable win in second T20 match held at 23 April in Harare restricting opposition to 99/10 against 119 and that was also their first ever victory in T20 against Pakistan.
=== 2022–2023: the redemption, 2022 World Cup qualifier success, first ever win on Australian soil and T20 World Cup ===
In Group A, United States and Zimbabwe both won their first two matches to secure their places in the semi-finals of the tournament. The Netherlands and Zimbabwe reached the final of the tournament to qualify for the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup. Hosts Zimbabwe beat the Netherlands by 37 runs in the final to win the tournament.

The Bangladesh cricket team toured Zimbabwe in July and August 2022 to play three one-day international (ODI) and three Twenty20 international (T20I) matches.Zimbabwe won the opening T20I match by 17 runs. It was the team&#x27;s sixth-consecutive win in T20Is, their best in the format. Zimbabwe won the third T20I by 10 runs to win the series by 2–1 margin, which was their first T20I series win against Bangladesh and defeated them in ODI matches too 2-1. Sikandar Raza was player of the series in both the series, Ryan Burl also made a record of 34 runs in a over against Nasum Ahmed bettering shakib al hasan&#x27;s record of 30 runs a over which dates back in 2019

Although they lost the series 3-0 , there was a good fight back against India in 3rd ODI ,completely whitewashed by India.

Zimbabwe lost the matches 2-0 , but sprung up a surprise to Australians to win the 3rd final ODI . Ryan Burl starred again with his 5/10 being the best bowling by a Zimbabwe player against Australia in ODIs, which incidentally was their first ever win on Australian soil .Ending the series 2-1 . Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton was impressed by team&#x27;s performance.

Zimbabwe qualified for the Super 12 of the 2022 T20 World Cup after victory over Scotland and Ireland and a loss to the West Indies. The first game of the Super 12 was a no result against neighbours South Africa. The second game brought about a famous 1 run win over Pakistan.

=== 2024: T20I world record===
On 23 October 2024, Zimbabwe set a world record for the highest score in a men&#x27;s T20I with 344 for 4 against The Gambia, during the 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup Africa Sub-regional Qualifier B tournament in Kenya. The innings included Sikandar Raza becoming the first Zimbabwe player to score a T20I century, making 133 not out off 43 balls.

<doc id="759319" wikidata="Q1754614" url="?curid=759319" title="Is This Desire?">
<text>Is This Desire? is the fourth studio album by the English musician PJ Harvey, released on 28 September 1998 on Island Records. It was re-released on vinyl LP in late January 2021. A separate demo compilation of tracks from the album titled &quot;Is This Desire? - Demos&quot; was also released on vinyl LP and CD.

== Background ==
Recorded on and off in Somerset and London between April 1997 and April 1998, it was co-produced by Flood, Head and Harvey herself, and featured instrumental contributions from Rob Ellis, John Parish, Mick Harvey, Eric Drew Feldman, Joe Gore and Jeremy Hogg. It marked a move away from Harvey&#x27;s earlier guitar-driven rock style into subtler, quieter, atmospheric soundscapes and mood pieces based around keyboards, bass and electronics.

Harvey spoke about the making of the album in an interview with &quot;Filter&quot; magazine in 2004, indicating it was the project of which, to date, she was proudest. &quot;Again working with Flood, again trying to find new ground, but a particularly difficult time in my life. So, it was a very, very difficult, difficult record to make and still one I find very difficult to listen to, but probably my favorite record that I&#x27;ve made because it had a lot of guts. I mean, I was making extremely difficult music, experimenting with techniques I hadn&#x27;t used before and not really caring what other people thought about it. I&#x27;m quite proud of that one.&quot; She also told &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;I do think &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; is the best record I ever made—maybe ever will make—and I feel that that was probably the highlight of my career. I gave 100 per cent of myself to that record. Maybe that was detrimental to my health at the same time.&quot;

John Parish reflected on the album&#x27;s recording in 2021: &quot;[&quot;Is This Desire?&quot;] is probably the most compromised album that Polly&#x27;s made, largely to do with the time over which it was made ... There were two long recordings sessions and almost a year&#x27;s gap between them. The bulk of the first session took place in a small studio in Yeovil, so it was much more Heath Robinson setup, and the second session, most or all of it took place in a huge expensive London studio, so there were differences in the technical capabilities of the studio, but the same musicians basically in both sessions and same producers and engineers. It’s very difficult to sustain the identity of a record like that. It was also the only record where the record company came in and had a degree of creative input, which had never been sanctioned on any of the other records, certainly none of the other records I was involved with. The record company often never heard anything until they got the mastered album! ... on this album there were a couple of people who I felt took advantage of the fact Polly wasn&#x27;t very well at that time. Normally she&#x27;s so decisive and strong about what she feels, about what&#x27;s going to happen, but on that record she wavered in the middle.&quot;

It is the first PJ Harvey album to feature lyrics printed on the inner sleeve.

The song &quot;The Wind&quot; was inspired by Saint Catherine, and in particular St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, Abbotsbury.
The lyrics discuss the chapel&#x27;s location on top of a hill, and end with an inversion of a traditional prayer which women used at the chapel to pray for a husband. The village of Abbotsbury is near PJ Harvey&#x27;s home.

== Critical reception ==
The album was met with critical acclaim. &quot;Q&quot; magazine praised the record as &quot;one of the most artfully truncated missives of bleakness and pain to have emerged... since the dawn of CD&quot;, CMJ called it &quot;another milestone in her already illustrious career&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said it &quot;seethes with hypnotic power&quot;; the magazine &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; claimed &quot;&quot;Is This Desire?&quot; will be a classic of the next 10 if not 20 years. It has the impeccable timing of jazz, the arrangement of a classic dance track, the depth of an orchestral symphony and the emotional charge of gospel.&quot; It received a Grammy Award nomination as Best Alternative Music Performance of 1998. Although it did not sell as well as her 1995 commercial breakthrough &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, it did spawn her biggest UK hit with the single &quot;A Perfect Day Elise&quot;; a second single, &quot;The Wind&quot;, charted on the UK Top 30.

<doc id="759327" wikidata="Q3555020" url="?curid=759327" title="Siege of Masada">
<text>The siege of Masada was one of the final events in the First Jewish–Roman War, occurring from 72 to 73 CE on and around a hilltop in present-day Israel. The siege is known to history via a single source, Flavius Josephus, a Jewish rebel leader captured by the Romans, in whose service he became a historian. According to Josephus the long siege by the troops of the Roman Empire led to the mass suicide of the Sicarii rebels and resident Jewish families of the Masada fortress.

In modern times, the story of the siege was revived as the Masada myth, a selectively constructed narrative based on Josephus&#x27;s account. The mythical narrative became a national symbol in the early years of Israel&#x27;s nationhood.

== Background ==

Masada has been described as &quot;a lozenge-shaped table-mountain&quot; that is &quot;lofty, isolated, and to all appearance impregnable&quot;. Historically, the fortress could be reached only by a single pathway that was too narrow for men to walk abreast. This pathway was named &quot;the Snake&quot; for the way it twists and zig-zags to the summit. Masada was named as the place where David rested after fleeing from his father-in-law, King Saul.

Flavius Josephus, a Jew born and raised in Jerusalem, is the only historian to provide a detailed account of the First Jewish–Roman War and the only person who recorded what happened on Masada. After being captured during the Siege of Yodfat and then freed by Vespasian, Josephus chronicled the Roman campaign. Josephus presumably based his narration on the field commentaries of the Roman commanders.

According to Josephus, Masada was first constructed by the Hasmoneans. Between 37 and 31 BC Herod the Great fortified it as a refuge for himself in the event of a revolt. In 66 AD, at the beginning of the First Jewish–Roman War, a group of Jewish extremists called the Sicarii overcame the Roman garrison of Masada and settled there. The Sicarii were commanded by Eleazar ben Ya&#x27;ir, and in 70 AD they were joined by additional Sicarii and their families expelled from Jerusalem by the Jewish population with whom the Sicarii were in conflict. 

Shortly thereafter, following the Roman siege of Jerusalem and subsequent destruction of the Second Temple, additional members of the Sicarii and many Jewish families fled Jerusalem and settled on the mountaintop, with the Sicarii using it as a refuge and base for raiding the surrounding countryside. 

According to modern interpretations of Josephus, the Sicarii were an extremist splinter group of the Zealots and were equally antagonistic to both Romans and other Jewish groups. It was the Zealots, in contrast to the Sicarii, who carried the main burden of the rebellion, which opposed Roman rule of Judea.

According to Josephus, on Passover, the Sicarii raided Ein Gedi, a nearby Jewish settlement, and killed 700 of its inhabitants.

Archaeology indicates that the Sicarii modified some of the structures they found at Masada. These include a building that was modified to function as a synagogue. It may in fact have been a synagogue to begin with, although it did not contain a &quot;mikvah&quot; or the benches found in other early synagogues. It is one of the oldest synagogues in Israel.

== Josephus&#x27;s narrative ==

In 72 AD, the Roman governor of Judaea, Lucius Flavius Silva, led Roman legion X &quot;Fretensis&quot;, a number of auxiliary units and Jewish prisoners of war, totaling some 15,000 men and women, of whom an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 were fighting men, to lay siege to the 960 people in Masada. The Roman legion surrounded Masada and built a circumvallation wall, before commencing construction of a siege ramp against the western face of the plateau, moving thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth to do so. Josephus does not record any attempts by the Sicarii to counterattack the besiegers during this process, a significant difference from his accounts of other sieges of the war.
The ramp was completed in the spring of 73, after probably two to three months of siege. A giant siege tower with a battering ram was constructed and moved laboriously up the completed ramp, while the Romans assaulted the wall, discharging &quot;a volley of blazing torches against ... a wall of timber&quot;, allowing the Romans to breach the wall of the fortress on April 16, 73 AD.

When the Romans entered the fortress, they found it to be &quot;a citadel of death&quot;. The Jewish rebels had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze and had killed each other, declaring &quot;a glorious death ... preferable to a life of infamy&quot;.

According to Josephus, &quot;The Jews hoped that all of their nation beyond the Euphrates would join together with them to raise an insurrection&quot;, but in the end there were only 960 Jewish Zealots who fought the Roman army at Masada. When these Zealots were trapped on top of Masada with nowhere to run, Josephus tells us that the Zealots believed &quot;it [was] by the will of God, and by necessity, that [they] are to die.&quot;

==Archaelogy==

The Masada site was extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archaeologist and former military Chief-of-Staff Yigael Yadin.

==Historical interpretations==
According to Shaye Cohen, archaeology shows that Josephus&#x27; account is &quot;incomplete and inaccurate&quot; and contradicted by the &quot;skeletons in the cave, and the numerous separate fires&quot;. Cohen speculates that &quot;some Jews killed themselves, some fought to the death, and some attempted to hide and escape. The Romans were in no mood to take prisoners and massacred all whom they found.&quot;

According to Kenneth Atkinson, there is no &quot;archaeological evidence that Masada&#x27;s defenders committed mass suicide.&quot;

According to archaeologist Eric H. Cline, Josephus&#x27; narrative is impossible because the Romans would have immediately pressed their advantage, leaving no time for Eleazar&#x27;s speech or the mass suicides. Instead, Cline proposes that the defenders were massacred by Romans.

== Masada myth ==

The siege of Masada and the resulting Masada myth is often revered in modern Israel as &quot;a symbol of Jewish heroism&quot;. According to Klara Palotai, &quot;Masada became a symbol for a heroic &#x27;last stand&#x27; for the State of Israel and played a major role for Israel in forging national identity.&quot; 

To Israel, it symbolized the courage of the warriors of Masada, the strength they showed when they were able to keep hold of Masada for almost three years, and their choice of death over slavery in their struggle against an aggressive empire. Masada had become &quot;the performance space of national heritage&quot;, the site of military ceremonies. Palotai states how Masada &quot;developed a special &#x27;love affair&#x27; with archeology&quot; because the site had drawn people from all around the world to help locate the remnants of the fortress and the battle that occurred there.

<doc id="759331" wikidata="Q507053" url="?curid=759331" title="Hiroshi Kaneda">
<text>is a Japanese astronomer and discoverer of minor planets from Sapporo, in the northernmost prefecture of Japan.

Kaneda ranks among the world&#x27;s most prolific individual discoverers of minor planets. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the co-discovery of 705 numbered minor planets, between 1987 and 2000, all of them in collaboration with astronomer Seiji Ueda. Along with being an astronomer, Kaneda works as a computer programmer and is a developer of astronomical software.

The main-belt asteroid 4677 Hiroshi, discovered by Atsushi Takahashi and Kazurō Watanabe at Kitami in 1990, is named after him.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
His many minor planet discoveries include (5646) 1990 TR, a near-Earth object of the Amor group, , an asteroid from the main-belt, (5407) 1992 AX, a Mars-crossing asteroid, (7352) 1994 CO, a Jupiter trojan, as well as the three named main-belt asteroids 4672 Takuboku, 5176 Yoichi and 6235 Burney (the latter was not named by him). As of 2016, most of his numbered discoveries remain unnamed &quot;(see table below)&quot;. All minor planets were co-discovered with Seiji Ueda.

<text>Rex Carver is a fictional British private eye created by the prolific writer Victor Canning. He appeared in four fast-paced, irreverently narrated novels in the 1960s. 

In the book preceding the novels, &quot;The Limbo Line&quot; (1963), the Government agency that Carver is unwillingly drawn into is described for the first time. It introduces Richard Manston, a retired agent drawn back into the world of spies, who also appears as a character in some of the later Rex Carver books. 

Although strictly a private investigator, Carver knows a number of people who work for a shadowy British undercover agency and he frequently runs into both enemy agents and hostile British agents during his adventures. It is by no means a stretch to call his adventures spy thrillers or to consider Carver himself a secret agent of sorts.

== Rex Carver novels ==
* The Whip Hand (1965). Carver agrees to track down a German au pair, Katerina Saxmann, who has gone missing in Brighton. But when the security services show up at his apartment within hours of him accepting the assignment, he realises there is far more going on. As the search leads Carver around the pleasure spots of Europe, the investigation, and his feelings for Katerina, get more complicated. But when a spectre from the continent’s past rears its head, Rex realises he might be in too deep.
* Doubled in Diamonds (1966). When Rex Carver is taken on by a solicitor’s firm to trace the sole beneficiary, one Arthur Finch, of an estate worth £6,000, he barely considers the job worth going out into the freezing weather for. But there is far more ice involved than Carver could have imagined. When he connects the seemingly innocuous yet hard-to-find Finch with a Hatton Garden diamond heist, he books the first flight to Finch’s bolthole in Ireland, determined to smoke him out.
* The Python Project (1967). An antique gold python bracelet, with diamonds for eyes and emeralds for scales, has been stolen from the home of its owner. The insurance company accountable for the jewellery wants it found, and hires Carver to recover it. When he discovers that the thief has also disappeared, an international chase around the Mediterranean ensues. But as he closes in on his target, so too does the net constrict around him. Rex must slip the coils of this snake while he can still breathe.
* The Melting Man (1968). Rex Carver wants a holiday, and is determined to have one. So when millionaire Cavan O’Dowda attempts to hire him to track down some stolen property, the answer is a flat ‘No’. Until, that is, Cavan’s beautiful daughter, Julia, arrives to collect him. The property in question is a top-of-the-range Mercedes, missing in France somewhere between Evian and Cannes; the driver turned up in Cannes without the car, and with no memory of the prior 48 hours. O’Dowda wants the vehicle, and the papers concealed within it, recovered at any cost.

<text>William Fife Knowland (June 26, 1908 – February 23, 1974) was an American politician and newspaper publisher. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from California from 1945 to 1959. He was Senate Majority Leader from August 1953 to January 1955 after the death of Robert A. Taft, and would be the last Republican Senate Majority Leader until Howard Baker in 1981.

As one of the most powerful members of the Senate and with his strong interest in foreign policy, Knowland helped set national foreign policy priorities and funding for the Cold War, the policy regarding Vietnam, Formosa, China, Korea and NATO, as well as other foreign policy objectives. He opposed sending American forces to French Indochina and was a sharp critic of Communist China under Mao Zedong. Knowland represented the right wing of the party and considered some of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s policies too liberal.

After the Republicans lost their majority in the 1954 election, he served as Minority Leader from January 1955 to January 1959. Knowland voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He was defeated in his 1958 run for Governor of California. He succeeded his father, Joseph R. Knowland, as the editor-in-chief and publisher of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;.

== Background ==
Knowland was born in the City of Alameda, Alameda County, California. His father, Joseph R. Knowland, was serving his third term as a US Representative. He was the third child, with an older sister, Elinor (1895–1978), and a brother, Joseph Russell &quot;Russ&quot; Knowland Jr. (1901–1961).

His grandfather Joseph Knowland (1833–1912) had made the family fortune in the lumber business. William F. Knowland was also a scion of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; fortune. His mother, Elinor Fife Knowland, died on July 20, 1908, less than a month after his birth. His father&#x27;s second wife, Emelyn S. West, raised Knowland as her own son.

A young Knowland made campaign speeches for the 1920 Republican ticket of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge at the age of 12. He married at 19, became a California State Assemblyman at 25, entered the US Senate at 37, and became a grandfather at 41.

== Early political career ==
Knowland, the president of the student body, graduated from Alameda High School in the Class of 1925. He graduated with a political science degree in three and a half years from the University of California, Berkeley in 1929. He was a member of Zeta Psi fraternity and the Order of the Golden Bear. California Governor C. C. Young and University of California President William Wallace Campbell praised Knowland&#x27;s political activities as a university student.

Knowland attended the 1932 Republican National Convention. From the gallery, he watched the California delegation which included his father, Earl Warren, Louis B. Mayer and Marshall Hale. The delegates renominated President Herbert Hoover and Vice President Charles Curtis.

In November 1932, he was elected to the State Assembly, where he served for two years. In 1934 he won election to the California State Senate, where he served for four years. He did not seek re-election in 1938 but remained active in the California Republican Party. He was also influential on the national scene, serving as the chairman of the executive committee of the Republican National Committee from 1940 to 1942. Knowland campaigned for Wendell L. Willkie, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for president in 1940.

== World War II ==
In June 1942, Knowland was drafted into the U.S. Army for World War II service. After a few months service as a private and sergeant, he went through Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He served as an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Marcellus L. Stockton Jr., then attended the military government school to study civil affairs. He was sent to Europe in 1944 and landed in France a month after D-Day. Knowland served in France initially with the Forward Echelon Communications Zone headquarters in France and Belgium, and later with the Fifteenth United States Army headquarters in Germany. During his military service, Knowland attained the rank of major and was assigned civil affairs and public affairs duties that were in line with his civilian education and experience and his military training.

===Military awards===
Knowland received the following military awards:
== U.S. Senate ==
Hiram Johnson, the senior U.S. senator from California, died on August 6, 1945. On August 14, 1945, Governor Earl Warren appointed Knowland to fill Johnson&#x27;s seat. Warren first offered the Senate seat to Joseph R. Knowland, who declined Warren&#x27;s offer: &quot;I lost the Senate Seat in 1914, I have the responsibility of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, Bring my boy, Billy home.&quot; Still serving overseas, Knowland learned of his new job from an article in &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;; Knowland&#x27;s wife Helen tried to telephone him with the news, but she couldn&#x27;t get past the military censors, who said it was not essential government business.

Knowland accepted his appointment and it was effective with his return to the United States on August 26, 1945. He was sworn in as a freshman senator in the 79th Congress on September 6, 1945, the day the Senate adjourned in memory of Hiram Johnson. He was assigned membership in the Commerce Committee, the Irrigation and Reclamation and Immigration Committee, and the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (the Truman Committee).

In 1946, in a special election for the last part of Johnson&#x27;s term, Knowland defeated Democrat Will Rogers Jr. by 334,000 votes. The special election featured a blank ballot, whereby electors had to write in the name of their choice. He also defeated Rogers in the general election by nearly 261,000 votes, winning a full term in the Senate in his own right.

Knowland became a caustic critic of the Harry S. Truman administration. He was publicly critical of the actions in the loss of China to Communism and the Korean War. However, Knowland admired the former Senator from Missouri personally. A firm believer in legislative authority under the US Constitution, Senate leader Knowland sometimes also was at odds with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower wrote that Knowland &quot;means to be helpful and loyal, but he is cumbersome&quot; and described the Senator&#x27;s foreign policy views, particularly on Red China, as &quot;simplistic.&quot; In his diaries, the publicly avuncular Eisenhower felt free to confide more critical assessments of his political acquaintances. &quot;Knowland has no foreign policy, except to develop high blood pressure whenever he mentions &#x27;Red China&#x27; ... In his case, there seems to be no final answer to the question, &#x27;How stupid can you get?&#x27;&quot; Fellow conservative Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater described Knowland as &quot;a very determined man, and a very highly principled one, and as long as he and Eisenhower agreed on the legislation that Ike wanted, Bill would fight his head off for it.&quot; In 1954, for example, Knowland voted in support of Eisenhower&#x27;s initiatives 91 percent of the time.

For his strong support for Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist government in China against Mao Zedong and the Communists, Knowland sometimes was called the &quot;Senator from Formosa&quot; (now known as Taiwan). A keen opponent of China&#x27;s accession to the United Nations, Knowland tangled with Indian statesman V. K. Krishna Menon over the issue, leading the latter to acidly recommend psychiatric treatment to the former. In later years, Knowland moderated his position, praising President Nixon&#x27;s diplomatic overture to China in 1972.

At the 1948 Republican National Convention, Knowland made the nominating speech for Warren as the vice presidential candidate, and he was seen on the podium with presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey.

In the June 1952 primary election, Knowland &quot;cross-filed,&quot; running for both the Republican and Democratic nominations. He got 2.5 million votes to 750,000 for his Democratic opponent, Clinton D. McKinnon, and won both nominations. In the general election, he was opposed only by an &quot;Independent Progressive.&quot; He won with 88% of the vote and carried 57 of the 58 counties.

The 1952 Republican National Convention met in Chicago. General of the Army Eisenhower and U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio were the two main candidates. On July 8, 1952, Taft asked Knowland if he was interested in the vice presidency. Eisenhower won the nomination and selected as his running mate Richard M. Nixon, who was serving as California&#x27;s junior U.S. senator. On September 23, 1952, Nixon gave the Checkers speech, a response to allegations that Nixon had maintained a secret fund of political donations from business leaders. (It was reported that Knowland said after the Checkers speech, &quot;I had to have my picture taken with that dirty bastard, crying on my shoulder!&quot;) Eisenhower&#x27;s aides contacted Knowland and persuaded him to fly from Hawaii to join Eisenhower and be available as a potential replacement running mate. However, seeing public opinion, Eisenhower retained Nixon on the 1952 Republican ticket.

When Taft died on July 31, 1953, Knowland was chosen to succeed him as Senate Republican Leader (majority leader from 1953 to 1955, minority leader from 1955 to 1959). At age 45, he is the youngest senator to occupy the position of majority leader. The Republican majority during Knowland&#x27;s stint as majority leader was tenuous. Taft&#x27;s Senate seat was filled by a Democrat, which gave Democrats 48 seats compared to the Republicans&#x27; 47. One Senator, Wayne Morse of Oregon, who dropped his Republican affiliation to become an independent, pledged to vote with the Republicans on organizing the Senate in 1954 and brought the Republican tally to 48 seats. The constitutional provision for the Vice President to cast a tie-breaking vote gave Republicans a working majority to organize the Senate.

Knowland&#x27;s Democratic counterpart was Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. Knowland and Johnson shared a cordial and respectful political relationship, often working in tandem on policy and procedure, including co-authoring a resolution in 1957 in an unsuccessful attempt to limit the filibuster, the practice of allowing minority viewpoints to use everlasting debate to obstruct the passage of legislation. &quot;To completely block the legislative process of government is too much power for any responsible person to want, and far too much power for any irresponsible person to have,&quot; Knowland said of the filibuster. Knowland and Johnson crafted and passed, in the Senate, the watered down Civil Rights Act of 1957. It was the first such law since Reconstruction. After the bill was passed, Knowland wept because of the bill&#x27;s perceived weakness in protecting civil rights.

Knowland called the Senate the &quot;most exclusive club of 96&quot; (there were 48 states at the time). He was slow to criticize its most infamous member, Wisconsin&#x27;s Republican junior Senator Joseph McCarthy. In 1953, McCarthy questioned the &quot;integrity and good faith&quot; of US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, which led Knowland to denounce McCarthy publicly. McCarthy was later condemned by the Senate for &quot;conduct contrary to Senate traditions&quot; in his vehement investigation of alleged communist infiltration of the US government.

Amid speculation that Eisenhower might not run for re-election, Knowland briefly floated his candidacy for president in 1956, but he withdrew when Eisenhower decided to seek a second term.

Knowland was Temporary Chairman of the 1956 Republican National Convention in the San Francisco Cow Palace. On appointing Knowland as delegate to the Eleventh General Assembly of the United Nations in 1956, Eisenhower wrote: &quot;Knowland brings to his leadership post an absolute, unflinching integrity that rises above politics. In the councils of government, he inspires faith in his motives and gives weight to his words.&quot;

Knowland had a long-running battle with Nixon, with whom he served in the Senate from 1951 to 1953, for influence in California Republican Party affairs. Nonetheless, he gave Nixon the constitutional oath for Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1953, and again on January 21, 1957, on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol (the second inauguration was delayed a day because January 20, the normal date, was a Sunday). In 1968, as Nixon crossed the Bay Bridge from San Francisco to Oakland, an aide pointed out the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; Tower and Nixon replied, &quot;Bastard.&quot;

== Campaign for the governorship ==

In 1958, Knowland decided to run for Governor of California instead of re-election to the Senate. His father was shaken by the decision, as he cherished the Senate seat; voters had denied him California&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1914.

Knowland secured the Republican nomination for governor after a brutal contest with incumbent Goodwin J. Knight. In the &quot;Big Switch,&quot; Knight agreed to run for Knowland&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat while Knowland ran for governor. Many felt Knowland would use the governorship to control the California Republican delegation in 1960 and to try to deny Nixon the presidential nomination but get it himself.

A critical issue in the campaign was Proposition 18, an initiative to enact a right-to-work law in California. Knowland endorsed the measure in excessive language, but Proposition 18 was highly unpopular, and the endorsement hurt Knowland. He was soundly defeated in the general election by the Democratic nominee, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown by a 60%-40% margin. After dominating California politics for over half a century, many other California Republicans were also defeated for statewide offices, including Knight. Following the election, Knowland&#x27;s political career was effectively over.

Among Joseph R. Knowland&#x27;s protégés, Representative John J. Allen Jr. lost his House seat to Jeffery Cohelan, and Alameda County Supervisor Kent D. Pursel lost his race for the State Senate to John W. Holmdahl. To pay off some of Knowland&#x27;s campaign debts, his father had to sell his &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; radio station, KLX, to Crowell Collier Broadcasting. Knowland never again ran for any elective office.

== After politics ==
The 1964 Republican National Convention, again in San Francisco&#x27;s Cow Palace, nominated Barry Goldwater for president. Knowland backed the Goldwater-Miller ticket and spoke for the Arizona Senator across the country.

Knowland was the titular head of the California Republican Party from 1959 to 1967, when he passed the party leadership to the new governor, Ronald Reagan. In the 1966 California gubernatorial campaign, Reagan ran on a law-and-order message, while Knowland and his old California Republican rival Richard Nixon worked tirelessly behind the scenes, enabling Reagan to win two thirds of the primary vote over George Christopher, the moderate Republican former mayor of San Francisco. The momentum from Reagan&#x27;s successful primary win carried over to the general election, where he defeated incumbent Democratic Governor Pat Brown in a landslide.

Russ, Knowland&#x27;s brother, died on October 6, 1961. Knowland became the sole successor to his father and to control of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;. Knowland became president, editor, and publisher of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; in 1966, after the death of his father. Knowland was typically called &quot;Senator&quot; by the staff after his return to the paper from Washington. He kept the editorial pages of the &quot;Tribune&quot; solidly Republican.

However, he took steps to add a bipartisan bent to the news pages, including the appointment in 1969 of a political editor with Democratic Party leanings. His son, Joseph W. Knowland, was Assistant Publisher with the position of Assistant General Manager.

In a cost-cutting move that ultimately hurt the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, the Southern Alameda County and Contra Costa County editions were trimmed. That opened the areas to Floyd Sparks (1900–1988), the owner of the &quot;Hayward Daily Review&quot;, and Dean Lesher (1902–1993), owner since 1947 of the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;. In early 1968, &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; circulation rose because the major San Francisco newspapers were on strike. When the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; returned, &quot;Tribune&quot; sales fell in home delivery and on-the-street sales.

As editor and publisher, Knowland took an interest in local affairs along with the job and was less concerned with national and foreign policy. During his tenure as newspaper executive, Oakland and the East Bay Area were changing, with the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley, the Black Panthers, and &quot;white flight&quot; to the suburbs.

He offered a $100,000 reward for the conviction of those responsible for the 1973 murder of Marcus Foster. The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) claimed responsibility. The SLA subsequently kidnapped Patricia Hearst and &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; editor J. Reginald Murphy. Such acts made Knowland fearful for his own safety.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; turned 100 years old on February 21, 1974. Knowland spoke on the occasion: &quot;For 100 years this newspaper has participated in the growth of Alameda and Contra Costa counties... Now as we look into the future it becomes ever more important that newspapers here and in other cities keep the public adequately informed.&quot; He went to all departments on that Thursday. At the banquet at Goodman&#x27;s Hall, Governor Ronald Reagan praised the &quot;Tribune&quot; and the Knowland family.

The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; was sold in 1977 by the Knowland family. After four ownership changes, it is now a daily newspaper of the Bay Area News Group (BANG), a subsidiary of MediaNews Group.

== Personal life ==
William F. Knowland was married to Helen Davis Herrick, whom he had met in the sixth grade. They were married on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1926. They were divorced on March 15, 1972, citing irreconcilable differences, a quiet reference to his affairs. Knowland then married Ann Dickson on April 29, 1972, but the two were estranged by the end of that year.

He and Herrick had three children: Emelyn K. Jewett, Joseph William Knowland, and Estelle Knowland. He had two stepchildren, Kay and Steve Sessinghaus, from his marriage to Dickson.

== Suicide ==
On February 23, 1974, Knowland died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, an apparent suicide, at his summer home near Guerneville, California. His personal life was in a shambles; heavy gambling took all his money and he died owing over $900,000 () to banks and impatient mobsters.

== Remains ==
At the Main Mausoleum of the Mountain View Cemetery, in Oakland, California on Floor I, M8J, N2, TI, Knowland is with his first wife, Helen Knowland Whyte (1907–1981) and her mother, Estelle Davis Herrick (1881–1963). Also contained are the remains of Ruth Lamb Caldwell Narfi (1909–2003) and her first husband, Hubert A. Caldwell (1907–1972) and second husband, Gaetano &quot;Tani&quot; Narfi (1905–1996)

At the Chapel of Memories in Oakland, California, two tiers down from his father, Joseph R. Knowland in the &quot;Serenity&quot; Section Tier 4 Number 6, a double book urn has only one side inscribed, &quot;U.S. Senator William F. Knowland, 1908–1974.&quot;

<doc id="759335" wikidata="Q594408" url="?curid=759335" title="Uh Huh Her (album)">
<text>Uh Huh Her is the sixth studio album by the English alternative rock musician PJ Harvey. The album was written, recorded and produced over a two-year period by the singer-songwriter herself. She also played every instrument on the album (the first such project since &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; in 1993) with the exception of the final drum tracks, added by long-time collaborator Rob Ellis. It was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom, and 8 June 2004 in the United States.

During the accompanying tour that lasted eight months, she performed the album&#x27;s unreleased title-track. &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; debuted and peaked at number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and has been certified Silver by the BPI. It became Harvey&#x27;s highest charting album to date in the U.S., peaking at number 29 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and had sold more than 135,000 copies there as of 2005, according to AskBillboard. Although it charted higher than &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; in many territories, &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; failed to achieve its predecessor&#x27;s chart longevity and crossover interest.

The album received largely positive reviews upon its release, although there was some criticism of its production. It currently holds a 79 out of 100 metascore at &quot;Metacritic&quot; based upon 28 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; also earned PJ Harvey nominations to awards such as the Grammy Awards and the Brit Awards.

== History ==
The album was written and recorded over a two-year period in Dorset, East Devon and Los Angeles. Much of the recording was done alone by Harvey using her four-track and eight-track home studio, guitar, keyboards and drum machine. For the first time since 1993&#x27;s &quot;4-Track Demos&quot; album, she produced it herself and played every instrument bar the final drum tracks, which were handled by her longtime collaborator Rob Ellis. Final recording and mixing was done by Head at the Presshouse Studio in rural East Devon in autumn/winter 2003.

Harvey told &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, &quot;I don&#x27;t think &#x27;tender&#x27; is a word that could be applied to anything I&#x27;ve written before, but that&#x27;s how I feel about this album and I&#x27;m really pleased about it. Some of the songs are very gentle, very loving; with others I had a lot of fun in the words I used and the way I sang them.&quot; She explained to &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine how she &quot;wanted to get back to the earthy, rootsy, more dirty side of things&quot; following the popular success of her last album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;. She said, &quot;I wanted this record to be simple, I wanted it to be ugly in some places, I wanted it to have a swagger to it... but also a real honesty and intimacy. I wanted a warmness and closeness and I wanted to make a welcoming record.&quot; To &quot;Spin&quot; magazine she said that, in contrast to the extreme darkness of some of her earlier LPs, &quot;I find an enormous amount of openness and hope on this record... &quot;The Desperate Kingdom of Love&quot; or &quot;You Come Through&quot; I find incredibly optimistic and tender.&quot; Harvey also explained to &quot;Tracks&quot; magazine that, &quot;I was looking for distressed, debased sounds. So all of the guitars are either tuned so low that it&#x27;s hard to detect what notes they&#x27;re playing or they&#x27;re baritone guitars or they&#x27;re played through the shittiest amps I could find.&quot;

On the inside sleeve of the album cover are a long set of self-portrait photographs that Harvey took over the years, and a series of scribbled annotations she collected during the songwriting process of &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; – notes to herself such as &quot;Scare yourself&quot;, &quot;Too normal? Too PJ H?&quot; and &quot;All that matters is my voice and my story&quot; (a piece of advice given to her by her friend Elvis Costello). She admitted to &quot;Shaken Stir&quot; that producing the record on her own was &quot;a completely draining, disorientating, exasperating, invigorating experience&quot; and &quot;one of the hardest pieces of work I&#x27;ve ever done... I couldn&#x27;t say that this record was an enjoyable experience. I think it was a journey that I learnt an enormous amount from, but certainly there were very enjoyable moments... I mean when I look back on it now it was a very difficult, hard and taxing time, and yet I&#x27;m so glad I did it – so glad.&quot;

Harvey underwent an eight month world tour in support of the album with drummer Rob Ellis and two new bandmates, bass player Dingo and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. The tour was captured for the DVD &quot;On Tour: Please Leave Quietly&quot;.

A song called &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; was regularly played during the tour, but not included on the album. It was eventually recorded for the digital compilation &quot;iTunes Originals – PJ Harvey&quot;. On the origin of album&#x27;s title PJ Harvey mentioned it in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2004: &quot;But it came from the chorus of a song, actually — there’s a song called “Uh Huh Her” that I play live but I chose never to record. The chorus is: “Don’t marry uh huh her/Don’t marry her her her.”&quot;

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; was released in May 2004 in the UK and peaked at #12 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was preceded by lead single &quot;The Letter&quot;, which reached #28 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Uh Huh Her&quot; became PJ Harvey&#x27;s highest-charting record on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching #29. Overall, however, it did not spark the same level of crossover interest as its million-selling predecessor &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;. As usual with Harvey, the critical reception was generally strong: &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described the record as &quot;profoundly moving&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;raw, dark and beautiful... a jagged, edgy winner&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; noted that &quot;No singer since Janis Joplin has moved as easily between primal scream and intimate sigh&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; hailed it as &quot;a thrilling, bone-rattling barrage, interleaved with moments of hushed, accordion-flecked intimacy whose closeness and apparent candour make you want to shield yourself from their passion.&quot; &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine, meanwhile, felt it was &quot;an extremely potent record... that contains more perspectives, characters and camera angles than maybe any PJ album to date&quot;. It won Harvey her sixth BRIT Award nomination, as Best British Female Artist, and her fifth Grammy Award nomination, for Best Alternative Music Performance of 2004.

<text>The Bangladesh men&#x27;s national cricket team (), commonly known as The Tigers, is the national cricket team of Bangladesh, administered by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). They are a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

They became an associate member of the ICC in 1977, and competed in six ICC Trophies but performed inconsistently until 1997, which marked the year of their first major victory, winning the 1997 ICC Trophy held in Malaysia. This set the way of becoming a Test-playing nation, a journey which ended with success in 2000. They played their first test match in November 2000 against India with a 9 wicket loss in Dhaka, becoming the 10th Test-playing nation. The Bangladesh cricket team has not won any ICC trophies till date.
Bangladesh&#x27;s first official foray into international cricket came in the 1979 ICC Trophy in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played their first ODI match, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. For a long time, football was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular – particularly in urban areas – and by the late 1990s, it had surpassed football.

In 1997, Bangladesh won the ICC Trophy in Malaysia and thus qualified for its first Cricket World Cup to participate in England in 1999. There, they defeated Pakistan – causing much upset – and also Scotland. On 26 June 2000, Bangladesh was granted full ICC membership.

Bangladesh holds the record for most consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2001 and 2004) and ODIs (23, between 1999 and 2002). After becoming Full Member, they had to wait until 2004 for first ODI win since the 1999 World Cup which was against Zimbabwe. Bangladesh&#x27;s maiden Test victory was against Zimbabwe in 2005 where securing a draw in the 2nd match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In 2009, Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both secured their first overseas Test series victory.

As of 8 December 2024, Bangladesh has played 150 Tests, winning 22. Results have improved predominantly at home with draws earned against Pakistan, India and South Africa and wins against England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia. They played their 100th Test against Sri Lanka in March 2017, which they won by 4 wickets.

As of 24 February 2025, the team has won 160 of its 446 ODI matches. They played their 100th ODI against India in 2004 which they won, 200th ODI against West Indies in 2009 which they won, 300th ODI in the quarter-final of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against India, which they lost and 400th ODI against Zimbabwe, which they won. They won their 100th ODI match when Afghanistan toured Bangladesh in October 2016.

Bangladesh have also played 182 T20Is, winning 71. They played their 100th T20I against Zimbabwe in July 2021 which they won. Results have improved with wins against Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and West Indies.

Bangladesh&#x27;s major achievements include reaching the semi-finals in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. That run included a famous comeback win over New Zealand, often considered one of the greatest wins in Bangladesh&#x27;s cricketing history. The team reached the quarter-finals in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup after beating England in Adelaide, still a landmark moment for the team and the fanbase. Bangladesh were runners up in three Asia Cups -in 2012, where they lost by a narrow margin of 2 runs in Mirpur, in 2016, the T20 version of the tournament held at home, and 2018 held in the UAE. They lost in the final of the 2018 Nidahas Trophy in the last over, the latest of a series of near-final losses for the national side. They won their first recognized multi-team trophy when lifted 2019 Ireland Tri-Nation Series.

As of 1 May 2024, Bangladesh is ranked 9th in Tests, 8th in ODIs and 9th in T20Is by the ICC.

==History==
===20th century===
Several East Pakistan-based sides played in Pakistani domestic cricket prior to Bangladesh&#x27;s declaration of independence of 1971—the East Pakistan cricket team fielded three players who later played ICC Trophy matches. In 1977, Bangladesh became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Bangladesh was one of fifteen teams to take part in the inaugural ICC Trophy. Held in 1979, it gave non-test playing countries the opportunity to qualify for that year&#x27;s World Cup. Bangladesh, under the captaincy of Raqibul Hasan, won two matches and lost two, but failed to progress beyond the first round. Victory in the South-East Asian Cricket Conference Tournament in February 1984 ensured Bangladesh qualified for the 1986 Asia Cup. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played their first One Day International against a Full Member of the ICC.

Captained by Gazi Ashraf, Bangladesh were dismissed for 94 runs and Pakistan reached their target for victory with seven wickets in hand. They lost their second ODI, which was against Sri Lanka, finishing last in the three-team tournament. Bangladesh qualified for the 1988 Asia Cup, this time hosting the tournament; it was the first time ODIs had been staged in the country. Although they lost all their matches, Bangladesh&#x27;s fixtures were retrospectively awarded ODI. Floods in the preceding months meant the tournament was in doubt, but it went ahead as planned. A charity match raised $70,000 for the flood victims. Bangladesh added a black mark in 1986 ICC Trophy with only 2 wins.

Bangladesh took part in the 1990 Austral-Asia Cup, the Asia Cup in 1990–91, 1995, 1997, and several other triangular tournaments. Still, it was not until 1998 that they won their first ODI. Their 22-match losing streak since their first ODI was at the time a record.

Bangladesh posted its first ODI win against Kenya, in India. thanks largely to Mohammad Rafique, who contributed a fiery 77 runs and took 3 wickets. He put on 137 for the first wicket with Athar Ali Khan whose own contribution was 47.

In October 1998, Bangladesh hosted (but did not participate in) the first ICC KnockOut Trophy ever held (the event later became the ICC Champions Trophy), a knock-out ODI tournament featuring all the test playing nations.

Bangladesh took part in each of the 1979, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994 editions of the ICC Trophy, and won the trophy in 1997, in the process qualified for the 1999 World Cup. The then General Secretary of Bangladesh Cricket Board, Aminul Huq Moni took the initiative to install Astro Turf in Abahani Cricket Ground and Bangabandhu National Stadium so that the local players had two full seasons to prepare on the type of pitch they would playing in ICC Trophy in 1997. Bangladesh also became a regular ICC member with the right to play ODIs and started hosting bilateral and triangular ODI tournaments. Earlier, in February Dhaka hosted the third and final SAARC cricket tournament. Bangladesh played in its first World Cup in England in 1999 and recorded their first win in a World Cup match against Scotland. Later on, Bangladesh created an enormous upset by beating Pakistan by 62 runs in the group match at Northampton. Bangladesh made 9/223 from its full 50 overs, and in reply, Pakistan could only manage 161 due to timely run-outs by wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud and some tight bowling by Khaled Mahmud, who took 3/31 from 10 overs. Mahmud was judged the man of the match. Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super Six round due to defeats in three of its five matches. However, the win over Pakistan, who finished runners-up to Australia, helped Bangladesh to gain test playing status the following year. Bangladesh had sacked coach Gordon Greenidge, who had steered the team through the 1997 ICC Trophy and into the 1999 World Cup on the morning of the match.

Former South Africa Test cricketer Eddie Barlow became Bangladesh&#x27;s coach in 1999. In preparation for becoming a Test playing country, Bangladesh established its own first-class competition in 1999–2000, although the matches were not given first-class status until the 2000–2001 season. The lack of an established first-class structure in the country until shortly before Bangladesh played its debut Test has been cited as one of the reasons the side struggled to adapt to the longer format of the game. The West Indies toured Bangladesh in October, winning both matches in the ODI series. After suffering a stroke in April 2000, Barlow vacated the position of coach and Sarwar Imran was handed the coaching job. In May and June 2000, Bangladesh hosted the Asia Cup; Bangladesh lost all three of their matches and playing against Pakistan Bangladesh recorded the heaviest defeat in ODIs, a margin of 233 runs at the time. Bangladesh participated in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy in October; their only match ended in defeat by England.

===First years as a Test team (2000–2003)===
On 13 November 2000, Bangladesh played their inaugural Test match, hosting India in Dhaka.

The first Test run in the history of Bangladesh Cricket came from the bat of Mehrab Hossain, who also scored the first ODI hundred by an individual player for Bangladesh in 1999. Captained by Naimur Rahman, Bangladesh lost by nine wickets, although &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that they &quot;surpassed all expectations by matching their neighbours, and at times even enjoying the upper hand&quot;. Aminul Islam Bulbul scored 145 in the first innings, becoming the third person to have scored a century in their team&#x27;s first Test; Rahman took 6 wickets for 132 runs, the second-best bowling figures in a country&#x27;s maiden Test. In March 2001, former Australian Test cricketer Trevor Chappell was appointed coach. The following month Bangladesh embarked on a tour of Zimbabwe to play two Tests and three ODIs. Zimbabwe, who at the time were ranked ninth out of the ten Test teams, won all five matches.

Bangladesh took part in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship, the second and final time the championship was held and the first the team had been eligible to play in. They lost both their matches by an innings. Mohammad Ashraful made his debut in the series and became the youngest player to score a Test century in his first match.

In November, Bangladesh hosted Zimbabwe for two Tests and three ODIs. The opening Test was curtailed by bad weather and ended in a draw; after losing their first five Tests, it was the first time Bangladesh had avoided defeat. Zimbabwe won all the remaining matches. After the Test series wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud replaced Rahman as captain. The following month Bangladesh toured New Zealand for two Test matches. Bangladesh&#x27;s batsmen struggled in unfamiliar conditions and the team slumped to two innings defeats.

In January 2002, Bangladesh hosted Pakistan for two Tests and three ODIs where Bangladesh lost all the matches. At this point, they had lost ten of their first eleven Tests; only South Africa had struggled as much in their introduction to Test cricket, also losing ten of their first eleven matches. Chappell blamed Bangladesh&#x27;s batsmen for the loss, saying &quot;they commit the same mistakes again and again, and need to learn to apply themselves, to bat in sessions&quot;. In April, former Pakistan Test cricketer Mohsin Kamal replaced Chappell as coach. When Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka in July and August they were on the receiving end of Sri Lanka&#x27;s largest margin of victory in Test cricket: an innings and 196 runs. Bangladesh lost both Tests and all three ODIs on the tour, recording their 50th defeat in 53 ODIs. Repeated poor performances prompted people to question whether Bangladesh had been granted Test status too soon.
Two defeats against Australia and New Zealand in pool matches knocked Bangladesh out of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.

In October, Bangladesh got whitewashed in both Test and ODI series against in South Africa.&quot;Wisden&quot; noted that &quot;Time and again ... came the mantra that [Bangladesh] would learn from the experience, that they could only improve by playing against the best, that there was genuine talent in the squad. But it wore thin.&quot; The final defeat set a record for most consecutive losses in ODIs (23), beating the previous record, which was also held by Bangladesh. When West Indies toured in November and December, Bangladesh lost both Tests and two out of the three ODIs, and one ended in no result. Bangladesh hit several new lows on the third day of the first Test: their lowest innings total (87), their lowest match aggregate (226), and the biggest defeat in their 16 Tests (by an innings and 310 runs).

South Africa hosted the 2003 World Cup in February and March. Bangladesh lost five of their six matches (one ended in no result), including fixtures against Canada, who hadn&#x27;t played international cricket since the 1979 World Cup, and Kenya, who eventually made the semi-finals of the tournament. In the aftermath of Bangladesh&#x27;s World Cup campaign, Habibul Bashar replaced Khaled Mashud as captain, and Kamal was sacked as coach with Dav Whatmore taking over the role. Whatmore was not able to begin the job immediately, so Sarwar Imran acted as interim coach during TVS Cup and South Africa&#x27;s tour of Bangladesh in April and May. Bangladesh lost all four ODIs by large margins and two Tests by innings.

===Under Dav Whatmore (2003–2007)===
Bangladesh played two Tests and three ODI matches on a mid-year tour of Australia in 2003.They lost every single match on that tour.

In August 2003, Bangladesh toured Pakistan to play three Tests and five ODIs matches. This was Bangladesh&#x27;s second tour to Pakistan, with the first occurring in 2001–02, when the teams played one Test match. Both series ended in whitewash, with Pakistan winning the Test series 3 – 0 and the ODI series 5 – 0.

In the first Test match of that series, Alok Kapali became the first Bangladesh player to take a hat-trick in Test cricket, dismissing Shabbir Ahmed, Danish Kaneria, and Umar Gul. However, in the third Test match of that series, Bangladesh came very close to its first Test victory, when it lost to Pakistan by only one wicket. It was just the tenth time in Test history that a team had lost by a single wicket.

In September–October 2003, England played 2 Tests and 3 ODIs against Bangladesh. England won both the Test matches and won all three ODIs by 7 wickets. Bangladesh&#x27;s captain, Mahmud, was booed. Ahead of Bangladesh&#x27;s tour of Zimbabwe in February and March the next year, he was dropped from the squad and batsman Habibul Bashar was granted the captaincy. At the time, Zimbabwe were without many of their senior players. Bangladesh lost the Test series 1–0, and the ODI series 2–1. The second Test was drawn after 3 days of no play due to heavy rains and brought an end to their run of 21 consecutive defeats dating back to November 2001, a world record in Test cricket. The solitary ODI victory was Bangladesh&#x27;s first international win since defeating Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup.

Bangladesh&#x27;s next matches were against the West Indies in May and June. Bangladesh lost the ODI series 3–0 and the Test series 1–0; by securing a hard-fought draw in the first match, Bangladesh managed to avoid defeat for just the third time in 29 Tests. Bangladesh participated in 2004 Asia Cup and 2004 ICC Champions Trophy winning only one match against Hong Kong. In the following months, Bangladesh suffered heavy defeats in Tests and in ODIs against touring New Zealand and India. However, in December,
India toured Bangladesh in December 2004. In 2nd ODI of the series, Bangladesh defeated India in its hundredth ODI, this being only the third time that it had won against a Test playing nation.

In January 2005, Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh for two Tests and five ODIs. The touring Zimbabwe side had suffered due to player disputes which in 2004 had led to the country&#x27;s temporary suspension from Test cricket. Of Zimbabwe&#x27;s 16-man squad, only their captain had played more than nine Tests; Bangladesh was the more experienced team. In the first match, Bangladesh secured their maiden victory in Test cricket. Bangladesh&#x27;s batsmen secured a draw in the second Test by batting out the final five sessions after coach Dav Whatmore had opined that &quot;Zimbabwe will win, unless our batsmen do something special&quot;.

In the match – which helped secure a historic first series victory for Bangladesh – Enamul Haque Jr broke his own bowling record for best figures in an innings for Bangladesh by taking 7 wickets for 95 runs, and secured the best figures in a match for Bangladesh: 12 wickets for 200 runs and captain Habibul Bashar hit half centuries in both innings. In the ODI series that followed, Zimbabwe won the opening two contests, and Bangladesh won the final three to take the ODI series.

After their maiden Test victory, Bangladesh embarked on its first tour of England in May and June 2005. The team faced unfamiliar conditions and the batsmen struggled against seam bowling. Bangladesh lost both matches in the Test series by an innings; the second Test was the 22nd time it had happened in 38 Tests. Pundits Mike Atherton and Richie Benaud criticised the team&#x27;s performances and suggested Bangladesh was not yet suited to Test cricket. A triangular ODI series with England and Australia followed. Bangladesh won just one match out of six, but their solitary victory was against an Australian side that at the time were world champions in what &quot;Wisden&quot; described as &quot;the greatest upset in 2,250 one-day internationals&quot;.

Mohammad Ashraful scored his first century in that match with a score of exactly 100, which was enough to take the team to victory and then played a blistering knock of 94 off 53 balls against England the following match.

Bangladesh&#x27;s next fixture was in Sri Lanka in September for two Tests and three ODIs. After the one-off victory against Australia in England, Bangladesh was a more confident team; however, Sri Lanka won all five matches by large margins. Captain Habibul Bashar lamented his side&#x27;s defeat, describing it as &quot;the worst tour since I took over the captaincy&quot;.

The home season of 2006 began with the series against Sri Lanka, which registered its first win against Sri Lanka ever in the second match of the ODI series.
However Bangladesh lost both ODIs and Test series 2–1 and 2–0 respectively.

In April, Australia toured for a 2-match Test series and 3-match ODI series. Bangladesh came very close to beating Australia in a Test match, taking a first-innings lead of 158, and eventually losing by only three wickets. However, Bangladesh lost the second Test by an innings and three ODIs by huge margins.

India hosted the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in October and November. Bangladesh failed to progress beyond the group stages, losing two of their three matches. Their only victory came against Zimbabwe.

In November, Zimbabwe toured Bangladesh for a T20 and a 5-match ODI series. Bangladesh won their inaugural T20I match against Zimbabwe in front of the home crowd.

Bangladesh subsequently went on to whitewash the same opponent in the five-match ODI series.

Bangladesh capped year 2006 with two more ODI victories over Scotland. That year, Shahriar Nafees became the first Bangladeshi to score over a thousand runs (which included three centuries) in a calendar year, while Mashrafe Mortaza became the leading wicket-taker in the world in ODIs staged in 2006 with 49 wickets.

Ahead of the World Cup Bangladesh faced Zimbabwe in four ODIs, and Bermuda and Canada one each; of those matches, Bangladesh lost a single ODI to Zimbabwe. Australia, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were the only teams to win both of their warm-up games. On 17 March, in their first match of the 2007 World Cup, hosted by the West Indies, Bangladesh secured a five-wicket win over India; the surprise result triggered late night partying in Bangladesh despite government bans on public gatherings. In their remaining group matches Bangladesh lost to Sri Lanka and defeated Bermuda, which was enough to secure qualification for the second round while India was knocked out. Bangladesh&#x27;s only victory in the Super Eights was against South Africa, losing to everyone else including Ireland, a team mostly made up of amateur cricketers.

In April 2007, after four years as coach, Mukil Mathavan chose not to extend his contract, but agreed to remain in charge until the end of May, to allow the BCB to find and appoint his successor and also to guide the side through the two Tests and three ODIs at home against India. After Bangladesh had helped knock India out of the tournament, the series was seen as an opportunity for India to exact revenge. India won the three-match ODI series 2–0, one being washed out. Bangladesh had not played Test cricket since April 2006. The first Test was shortened due to rain and drawn, but India won the second by their largest margin ever (by an innings and 239 runs). In the aftermath Habibul Bashar, who had previously resigned as ODI captain, was replaced as captain by 22-year-old Mohammad Ashraful in all forms of the game. Mashrafe Mortaza was appointed vice-captain.

===Under Shaun Williams (2007)===
BCB appointed their Under-19 coach Shaun Williams as Bangladesh&#x27;s interim coach until they find Whatmore&#x27;s long-term successor. Mohammad Ashraful was appointed Test &amp; ODI captain in June 2007. Ashraful&#x27;s first series in charge was a tour of Sri Lanka in June and July. Bangladesh suffered heavy defeats in each of the three Tests; losing by an inning on every occasion, and three ODIs. In the first innings of the second Test, Bangladesh was bundled out for their lowest total (62) at that time.

Before the World T20, Bangladesh played two T20Is in Kenya. Here, they enjoyed victory over Kenya, but lost to Pakistan. South Africa hosted the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in September. Bangladesh defeated the West Indies at the group stage to progress to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. However, it was the only match they won in the tournament, losing next four matches. During the Super 8 match against Bangladesh, Australian fast bowler Brett Lee took the first Twenty20 International (T20I) hat-trick ever achieved.

===Under Jamie Siddons (2007–2011)===

In late October, BCB appointed Jamie Siddons, an Australian cricketer, as their head coach. At the end of 2007, Bangladesh toured New Zealand. They were soundly beaten 3–0 in the one-dayers. Bangladesh started the new year with the Test leg of the tour. These matches were also one-sided, where Bangladesh lost the series 2–0.

In February–March 2008, South Africa clean-swept Bangladesh across formats. The tour included two Tests and three ODIs. However, in the 1st Test, Bangladesh secured a first innings lead of 22 runs after restricting South Africa for 170.

Bangladesh then defeated non-Test-playing Ireland 3–0 in an ODI series at home in the same month, ending a run of 14 losses.

Pakistan hosted Bangladesh for 5 ODIs and a T20I in April. It was a miserable tour for Bangladesh where they lost all games.

Bangladesh lost both first-round games against Pakistan and India at a triangular ODI tournament held in Bangladesh in June.

At the 2008 Asia Cup held in Pakistan, Bangladesh won their first group stage game against associate UAE. Even though they lost to Sri Lanka in the next group stage match, Bangladesh reached the super four stage, before losing the next three games against India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

They were later got whitewashed 0–3 in the ODIs during their tour to Australia in August–September.

In October, New Zealand toured Bangladesh for three ODIs and two Tests. Shortly before the tour, fourteen Bangladesh players left to play in the Indian Cricket League and were subsequently banned for ten years. Six of the players were centrally contracted, including former captain Habibul Bashar. With a less experienced team than usual and a poor record against New Zealand, Bangladesh was expected to lose heavily. After winning the opening ODI (their first ODI victory ever over New Zealand), Bangladesh went on to lose the series 2–1. New Zealand won the first Test by three wickets in what their coach, John Bracewell, described as &quot;one of the great character wins&quot;. The second Test ended up in a rain curtailed draw, sealing the series victory for New Zealand (1–0). But in the process Shakib Al Hasan emerged as an all-rounder. Having previously been selected primarily as a batsman, he went on to take the best bowling figures in an innings for a Bangladesh player, 7 wickets for 36 runs, beating the record set by Enamul Haque Jr three years earlier.

In November, Bangladesh toured South Africa. They lost all their matches, including the only T20I match, two of the three ODIs (the third being washed out due to rain) and both Tests by innings.

In December, however, Bangladesh bounced back from the previous lacklustre performances by threatening to win the first Test match against Sri Lanka at home by chasing down the highest fourth innings total of 513. Though they fell 107 runs short, their performances were praised. But in the second test match of this home series in January, Bangladesh succumbed to a 465 runs defeat, conceding the series 2–0 to Sri Lanka. Then Zimbabwe joined the hosts and the Lankan team for a tri-series ODI tournament, which proved to be more evenly matched than was expected. In the first match, Zimbabwe defeated Bangladesh by an excellent performance, but then was defeated by Sri Lanka by a huge margin, leaving Bangladesh needing to win with a bonus point against the Lankans in the last group match to go through to the finals to join the Lankans. In a reduced match due to rain interruptions, Bangladesh recorded their second ODI win over Sri Lanka to reach the finals. However, at the Finals, they were beaten by the Lankans who claimed the Series.

Later in the same month the three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe at home was won by Bangladesh 2–1.

At the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 held in England, Bangladesh crashed out of the tournament at the group stage after losing both games against India and associate Ireland.

The aftermath of the losses at the global event, the selectors appointed Mashrafe Mortaza as the new captain of the team for the tour to the West Indies so that Ashraful could focus on his batting. The two Test series was played amidst controversy when a pay dispute between the West Indian players and the West Indies Cricket Board led a number of West Indian players boycotting the series, which forced the West Indies to select a number of inexperienced players as replacements. Bangladesh went on to win both of the Tests, winning the first Test by 95 runs and the second by four wickets. In the process they achieved their first overseas Test series victory.

In the ODI series which followed, Bangladesh secured their first ODI win against the West Indies at the 14th attempt.

Bangladesh won the series 3–0, but lost the only Twenty20 match.

Bangladesh emerged victorious 4–1 and 4–1 in back to back five match ODI series against Zimbabwe away (in August) and home (in October–November).

In November, Shakib was named &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Test Player of the Year&quot;.
In January 2010, Bangladesh hosted a tri-series ODI tournament with India and Sri Lanka. They failed to win a match (in 4 matches) and went out of the tournament. That was followed by a two-match Test series against India at home, which Bangladesh lost 2–0.

During full away tour in February 2010 against New Zealand, Bangladesh lost all matches (only T20I, three ODIs and only Test).

In February–March 2010, England visited Bangladesh to play three ODIs and two Test matches. Bangladesh lost all their ODIs and Tests in the series.

In May, Bangladesh took part in the 2010 World Twenty20. They lost all their matches at group stage (against Pakistan and Australia) and failed to progress to the Super Eights stage.

In May and June, Bangladesh played two Test matches against England away, losing both, although Tamim Iqbal scored two centuries in the series.

Between the Tests and ODIs against England, Bangladesh took part in the 2010 Asia Cup during June, but lost all their matches vs India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

In the ODI series, England comfortably won the first match. However, in the second match at Bristol, Bangladesh beat England for the first time in international cricket (England were the only Test playing nation yet to be beaten by Bangladesh), bowling England out in the final over to win by five runs.
However England won the third ODI at Birmingham and sealed the series 2–1. Bangladesh extended this tour in Europe to play a 2-match ODIs series against Ireland. The series was shared (1–1). The one-off ODI against Scotland was abandoned due to heavy rains. Later Netherlands won the last one-off ODI of the tour.

In October New Zealand went to Bangladesh for five ODIs. Mortaza suffered an injury in the first match and Shakib took over as captain. Under his leadership Bangladesh won the series 4–0 (2nd ODI was abandoned due to rain), securing their first series victory against a full strength ICC Full Member nation.

Although unable to play against New Zealand due to injury, while the series was in progress Tamim Iqbal was named &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Test Player of the Year&quot;.

In December Bangladesh hosted Zimbabwe for five ODIs. After losing the opening match, Bangladesh went on to win the next three complete matches, with 4th ODI called off due to rain, to beat Zimbabwe 3–1.

In February and March 2011, Bangladesh co-hosted the World Cup with India and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh lost the tournament opener against India, before the win against Ireland. The next match was won by West Indies after dismissing Bangladesh for 58 runs, the team&#x27;s lowest score in ODIs and a record low for a Full Member at the World Cup. The West Indies and Bangladesh team buses were stoned as they left the ground, and so was Shakib&#x27;s house. In the match against England, Bangladesh&#x27;s score was at one point 169/8 but tail ender 58 run partnership brought victory for the team. Bangladesh&#x27;s win in this match was only their second against England in a total of 15 ODIs.

Bangladesh later defeated the Netherlands, making their final match of the group stage a must-win contest. Against South Africa, Bangladesh succumbed to their second-largest defeat in ODIs and became the first Full Member team to be bowled out for under 100 twice in World Cups, thereby failing to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament.

Then Australia completed a 3–0 sweep in ODIs against Bangladesh when they visited the country in April.

Middle of the Australian visit, BCB confirmed that Siddons unlikely to win a contract extension from the moment his team failed to meet lofty home expectations during the 2011 World Cup. Under his mentorship, Bangladesh won 2 Tests (in 19), 31 ODIs (in 84). They did not win any T20Is (in 8) during this period. First overseas Test series victory, first Test match and series victories over West Indies, first ODI wins against New Zealand, West Indies and England, clean sweeps in ODIs against West Indies (away) and New Zealand (home), reaching the final of a triangular tournament where all participants are ICC full members, consistent wins in bilateral ODI series against Zimbabwe (4) were the highlights for Siddons as the Bangladesh head coach. During his three-and-a-half-year tenure as coach Siddons introduced a full coaching staff for the first time, including coaches for bowling, strength and conditioning, and fielding. Under Siddons Bangladesh&#x27;s reliance on spin bowlers continued, partly because pitches in the country encourage spin bowlers, and frequently only two seam bowlers were used in a match. Siddons was credited with helping the team improve mentally.

=== Under Stuart Law (2011–2012) ===
A lengthy hunt for a head coach, followed Siddons&#x27; exit encountering the names of Vincent Barnes and Stuart Law as possible appointees. Law, who at the time was the interim head coach of Sri Lanka following Trevor Bayliss&#x27; departure, was named Bangladesh&#x27;s new head coach starting from 1 July 2011.

Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe in August 2011 for a one-off Test and five ODIs. The Test marked Zimbabwe&#x27;s return to the longest-format of the game, after a self-imposed withdrawal in January 2006 as the sport in the country was in a state of disarray. Bangladesh lost the match by 130 runs. Though they were expected to do well with the Test and the ODIs, Bangladesh lost the subsequent one-day series 3–2. In the aftermath of the series, captain Shakib Al Hasan and vice captain Tamim Iqbal were sacked from their leadership roles, with a BCB representative citing their poor leadership. Later that month, wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim was named captain, with all-rounder Mahmudullah as his deputy.

Bangladesh&#x27;s struggles at the international level have been epitomised by the ineffectiveness of their fast bowlers. Between January 2010 and August 2011, they took 37 wickets in 8 Tests at an average of 67.67, the worst out of the nine teams playing regular Test cricket in this period.

Though Bangladesh won Rahim&#x27;s first match in charge, the only T20I against West Indies at home in October, the team lost the subsequent ODI series 2–1 and the two-match Test series 1–0.

Pakistan toured in December, and during the first of three ODIs Bangladesh were dismissed for their 13th score of less than 100 in the format, overtaking Zimbabwe&#x27;s record of 12 times. Bangladesh got whitewashed comprehensively across formats, 0–1 (T20I), 0–3 (ODIs) and 0–2 (Tests).

In March Bangladesh hosted in the 2012 Asia Cup featuring India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh entered the tournament with just two wins from 29 Asia Cup matches. Victories against India and Sri Lanka saw Bangladesh face Pakistan in the final, only the second time the team had reached the final of a multi-national competition. Though Pakistan won the final by two runs, Bangladesh had exceeded expectations. During the tournament, Tamim Iqbal became the first Bangladeshi player to score four consecutive fifties in ODIs. Shakib Al Hasan was named man of the series after contributing with both the bat and the ball, making 237 runs and taking 6 wickets respectively.

The following month Law announced he would be stepping down as coach in June when his contract was due to expire for personal reasons. Bangladesh had not won any Tests (in 5) under Law. Further they only won 5 ODIs (in 15) and 1 T20I (in 2) during this period. Reaching the finals of Asia Cup 2012 was the pinnacle of Law&#x27;s tenure as Bangladesh coach.

=== Under Richard Pybus (2012) ===
In May 2012 Bangladesh appointed England born Richard Pybus as their new head coach for two-years, replacing Stuart Law who stepped down from the post in April.

In July, Bangladesh toured Ireland and Netherlands. Bangladesh clean swept the three-match T20I series becoming no. 4 in T20I rankings surpassing Pakistan and Australia. In the same month, Bangladesh lost a T20I against Scotland and shared the two-match T20I series against Netherlands by 1–1.

Bangladesh crashed out of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 by losing to New Zealand and Pakistan in the first round.

After only four months at the helm, Pybus notified the BCB of his unwillingness to continue due to issues with his contract and interference from administration. Under him Bangladesh won 4 T20Is (in 8).

=== Under Shane Jurgensen (2012–2014) ===
The team&#x27;s bowling coach and Australian Shane Jurgensen was appointed as the interim Bangladesh coach for the series against West Indies at home in November–December 2012. The home side lost the two Tests, but won the ODI series 3–2, before losing the only T20I.

In February 2013, BCB announced that Jurgensen will continue as Bangladesh&#x27;s head coach for the rest of the year.

Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka in March 2013 for a full series. In the 1st Test at Galle Mushfiqur Rahim scored the first double century for Bangladesh in test cricket, and Mohammad Ashraful chipped in with a handy 190. They were able to draw the 1st Test against Sri Lanka, the first time ever against the island nation.
Sri Lanka won the 2nd Test by 7 wickets and the two match test series 1–0. The three match ODI series was shared 1–1 since the 2nd ODI being washed out. Bangladesh lost the only T20I too.

Then they toured Zimbabwe from April–May. Bangladesh lost the 1st Test by 335 runs, which marked Zimbabwe&#x27;s biggest win. Later they won the 2nd Test by 173 runs to share the series with Zimbabwe (1–1). Bangladesh lost the ODI series (1–2) before sharing the T20I series (1–1).

Later in October–November 2013, New Zealand toured Bangladesh for a full series. Bangladesh achieved a new feat sharing the two-match test series (0–0) on home soil against New Zealand, the first against the country.

Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh for full series from January–February 2014. Bangladesh slip to their fourth-heaviest defeat in their Test history after losing the 1st Test by an innings and 248 runs. The 2nd test was a high scoring draw and Bangladesh lost the series (0–1). Later they got whitewashed in the T20I (0–2) and the ODI (0–3) series.

That was followed up by a series of defeats (0–4) against Asian Cricketing nations (India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) at the league stage of 2014 Asia Cup conducted on their home soil and Bangladesh finished at the bottom of the table. Associate Afghanistan&#x27;s win against Bangladesh was their first ODI victory against a Test-playing nation.

Bangladesh ended their 11-match win-less run in 2014 defeating two associates (Afghanistan and Nepal) in consecutive T20Is at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 Group stage. Their loss to another associate, Hong Kong, did not prevent them reaching the Super 10 stage. However at the Super 10 stage, Bangladesh lost all (0–4) their matches against West Indies, India, Pakistan and Australia.

The coach resigned from his position less than a month after the World T20, where the team won just two out of seven matches. Under Jurgensen, Bangladesh won 1 Test (in 10), 8 ODIs (in 21) and 3 T20Is (in 14). Highlights of his tenure were the Test win after 4 years (against Zimbabwe), shared two-test series against New Zealand at home, 3–0 ODI clean sweep against New Zealand at home and securing 2 draws in Tests against Sri Lanka (away and home).

=== Under Chandika Hathurusingha (2014–2017) ===

====2015: Rise in ODI====
At the turn of the new year, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan emerged as the number one all-rounder in all formats of the game. This was the first time that any player ever achieved such a feat, after the ICC introduced ranking system.

During the group stage of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh defeated Afghanistan in their first game where Shakib Al Hasan became the first Bangladeshi cricketer to reach 4,000 ODI runs and their next match against Australia was Washed Out. They lost their next game to Sri Lanka by 92 runs. Following that, they achieved their highest successful run-chase in an ODI, when they chased down Scotland&#x27;s 318, Bangladesh later qualified for the second quarterfinal in the 2015 world cup, by defeating England. At the second quarter-final, India comprehensively defeated Bangladesh by 109 runs, knocking them out of the 2015 World Cup.

A full strength Indian team arrived in Bangladesh in June 2015, for a one-off Test and 3 ODIs, where the Indians were expected to win comfortably. During the Test, the Indian team was too strong for Bangladesh where they were enforced to follow on. But the heavy rain interruptions denied a decisive result (only 184.2 overs were played). However excellent performances by the batsmen and ODI debutant bowler Mustafizur Rahman had the tables turned over as Bangladesh convincingly won the first two ODIs and for the first time, won a bilateral series against India by a margin of 2–1.

During July 2015 South Africa visited Bangladesh for 2 T20Is, 3 ODIs and 2 Tests. South Africa whitewashed Bangladesh in the T20I series (2–0) and took the lead of ODI series winning the first match. However Bangladesh came back strongly and completely dominated South Africa in the following two matches, showing excellent performance in all three departments where none of the team in any match could reach 200 runs in an innings in the whole ODI series, to win the series by a margin of 2–1, which marked the first series win ever against South Africa. Two match test series was shared (0–0) after heavy monsoon rains curtailed both games (played 221 and 88.1 overs respectively).

Strong performances shown by Bangladesh in ODIs since the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, winning ODI series against Pakistan, India and South Africa, helped it jump from ninth to seventh in the ODI Team Rankings. Since they were ranked No. 7 in ODIs on 30 September 2015 which was the cut-off date, they have qualified for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy replacing West Indies.

However they were again comprehensively beaten by India in the final.

However Bangladesh did not have a significant success during the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 held in India in March–April 2016. Wins against two associates (Netherlands and Oman) and the washed out game against another associate (Ireland) at the group stage saw them reach the Super 10.

In the group stage match against Oman, Tamim Iqbal became first Bangladeshi batsman to score a T20I century and at least a century in all formats. They returned home losing all four games at the Super 10 stage against full members Pakistan, Australia, India and New Zealand.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is the governing body for the Bangladeshi cricket team and the sport in the country. The BCB is responsible for maintaining grounds and promoting the sport. It was founded in 1972 as the Bangladesh Cricket Control Board. Its first constitution was drafted in 1976. The board changed its name, dropping &quot;control&quot; from its title, in January 2007. The president of the BCB is appointed by the government of Bangladesh. The board also controls the team&#x27;s sponsorship. Since 2003 telecommunications company Grameenphone has sponsored the men and women&#x27;s national teams. Between 2007 and 2011 they invested in developing sport in the country. In 2006 the Board established an academy to encourage the development of young and inexperienced players. The Board issues central contracts to the national players and issuing match fees. In 2005 players were given about $1,000 for each Test they played and $500 per ODI.

==Fan following==
Before Bangladesh had even secured Test status, cricket fans in the country took the game seriously; when the team lost an ODI against Kenya in March 1999, several hundred fans protested outside the offices of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). On learning of Bangladesh&#x27;s promotion to Test status, thousands of people celebrated on the streets. Then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina remarked that &quot;I can&#x27;t express my joy in words at this happiest hour of the nation&quot;. At the time cricket was the second-most popular sport in the country behind football. When Bangladesh began its first Test match on 10 November 2000 at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, the stadium was nearly full on the first day as around 40,000 people watched the team take on India. As the match partly overlapped with the festival of Shab-e-Barat, numbers attending declined as the match progressed. In 2011, Bangladeshi politician Saber Hossain Chowdhury opined that &quot;In Bangladesh cricket is not simply a game, it is a symbol of national unity&quot;, and in the words of AHM Mostofa Kamal, president of the BCB in 2011, &quot;People of Bangladesh take cricket religiously&quot;.

The people of Bangladesh are referred as &quot;the most passionate cricket fans&quot; among the cricket world. When Bangladesh are victorious, the fans sometimes take to the streets in celebration. When Bangladesh defeated India in the 2007 World Cup, thousands of people celebrated into the night on the streets of Dhaka despite there being a ban on public gatherings at the time. Although fans are jubilant in victory, they can also be vocal in defeat. When Bangladesh lost to England in an ODI in November 2003, the then captain Khaled Mahmud was booed off the field. During the 2011 World Cup, Bangladesh succumbed to a record defeat against West Indies, registering the team&#x27;s lowest score in ODIs. Bangladeshi fans booed and stoned the buses of both teams (Bangladesh&#x27;s intentionally, West Indies&#x27; mistakenly), as was Shakib Al Hasan&#x27;s house.

==Team colours and sponsorship==

In Test cricket, Bangladesh wears cricket whites, with the BCB logo on the left chest and the sponsor&#x27;s logo on the right chest. Fielders wear a dark green cap or a white wide brim sunhat. The helmets are also dark green. In limited overs cricket, Bangladesh wears a green uniform with red being the secondary colour and the BCB logo on chest and the sponsor&#x27;s logo on the centre and &quot;BANGLADESH&quot; written underneath in white letters, with the fielders wearing a green baseball cap with red accents or a green wide-brimmed hat. During ICC tournaments, the sponsor&#x27;s logo is placed on the left sleeve. In the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh wore an olive green uniform with yellow accents and a horizontal stripe with tiger-stripe motif on the chest.

<text>The colonial colleges are nine institutions of higher education chartered in the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution before the founding of the United States. These nine have long been considered together, notably since the survey of their origins in the 1907 &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot;.

Seven of the nine colonial colleges became seven of the eight Ivy League universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Dartmouth. The remaining Ivy League institution, Cornell University, was founded in 1865. These are all private universities.

The two colonial colleges not in the Ivy Leaguethe College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia and Rutgers University in New Jerseyare now both public universities. William &amp; Mary was a royal institution from 1693 until the American Revolution. Between the Revolution and the American Civil War, it was a private institution, but it suffered significant damage during the Civil War and began to receive public support in the 1880s. William &amp; Mary officially became a public college in 1906.

Rutgers was founded in 1766 as Queen&#x27;s College, named for Queen Charlotte. For much of its history, it was privately affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. It changed its name to Rutgers College in 1825 and was designated as the State University of New Jersey after World War II.

==The nine colonial colleges==
Seven of the nine colonial colleges began their histories as institutions of higher learning while existing preparatory schools developed two. Dartmouth College began operating in 1768 as the collegiate department of Moor&#x27;s Charity School, a secondary school started in 1754 by Dartmouth founder Eleazar Wheelock. Dartmouth considers its founding date as 1769 when it was granted a collegiate charter. The University of Pennsylvania began operating in 1751 as a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, and added an institution of higher education in 1755 with the granting of a charter to the College of Philadelphia.

==Other colonial-era foundations==
Several other colleges and universities can be traced to colonial-era &quot;academies&quot; or &quot;schools&quot; but are not considered colonial colleges because they were not formally chartered as colleges with degree-granting powers until after the formation of the United States in 1776. Listed below are the founding dates of the schools that served as predecessor entities and the years they were chartered to operate an institution of higher learning.

<doc id="759346" wikidata="Q1130378" url="?curid=759346" title="Persian mythology">
<text>Iranian mythology, or Persian mythology in western term (), is the body of the myths originally told by ancient Persians and other Iranian peoples and a genre of ancient Persian folklore. These stories concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient Persians&#x27; own cult and ritual practices. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of not only Iran but of the Persosphere, which includes regions of West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, and Transcaucasia where the culture of Iran has had significant influence. Historically, these were regions long ruled by dynasties of various Iranian empires, that incorporated considerable aspects of Persian culture through extensive contact with them, or where sufficient Iranian peoples settled to still maintain communities who patronize their respective cultures. It roughly corresponds to the Iranian Plateau and its bordering plains.

The Encyclopædia Iranica project uses the term &quot;Iranian cultural continent&quot; for this region.

==Religious background==
Most characters in Persian mythology are either good or evil. The resultant discord mirrors the nationalistic ideals of the early Islamic era as well as the moral and ethical perceptions of the Zoroastrian period, in which the world was perceived to be locked in a battle between the destructive &quot;Ahriman&quot; and his hordes of demonic &quot;Div&quot;s and their Aneran supporters, versus the Creator Ahura Mazda, who although not participating in the day-to-day affairs of mankind, was represented in the world by the &quot;izad&quot;s and the righteous &quot;ahlav&quot; Iranians. The only written texts relating to religious come from prophet Zoroaster, initiated the reforms which would become Zoroastrianism.

==Good and Evil==
Iranian mythology is based on the battle between good and evil. Indo-Iranian peoples believed in two general categories of gods: Ahuras, and evil: Divan. The characteristics of these two ranks of gods among Iranians and Hindus, and were transformed into each other, in the sense that among Indians Ahuras became evil and Divan became good, And among Iranians, Ahuras became good and Divan became evil. They sacrificed for both types of gods. The purpose of the sacrifice for the evil gods was to pay them a ransom to stop killing people. Sacrifice was made for good gods to seek help and blessing from them. On the other side of the fence is Zahhak, a symbol of despotism who was, finally, defeated by Kāve, who led a popular uprising against him. Zahhak () was guarded by two vipers which grew out from both of his shoulders. No matter how many times they were beheaded, new heads grew on them to guard him. The snake, like in many other mythologies, was a symbol of evil, but many other animals and birds appear in Iranian mythology, and, especially, the birds were signs of good omens. Most famous of these is the Simurgh, a large, beautiful, and powerful bird; and the Huma bird, a royal bird of victory whose plume adorned Persian crowns. Peri (Avestan &quot;Pairika&quot;), a beautiful albeit evil woman in early mythology, gradually became less evil and more beautiful. The conflict between good and evil is prevalent in Persian myths as well as Zoroastrianism.

== Development ==

Before the Medes, Aryan civilizations lived in this land, which mostly had no linguistic, racial, or even religious kinship with their neighbors outside the Iranian plateau, and sometimes they had solidarity. These tribes included Lullubi, Gutian, Kassites, and Urartu. The Elamites also had an old and well-known civilization in the southwest of the Iranian plateau, but they were not of the Aryan race. These tribes, who controlled the southern half of Iran, the west and the northwest, had their own special myths. Not much is known about their mythology. However, Kassites mythology has some similarities with later Iranian civilizations, namely the Medes and Persians, especially in the names. The mythology of the Elamites, who were a separate people and had linguistic affinities with the non-Aryans of India, shares some myths contained in the Rigveda. The traditions and beliefs of these people influenced the beliefs of their later society, which was under the cultural domination of the Aryans. With the power of the Medes and then the Persians, a newer mythology, known as the comprehensive mythology of Iran, began. Researchers believe that before the power of the Medes, a branch of Aryans migrated from Iran to India. That is why the ancient forms of Indian mythology are very similar to the ancient forms of Iranian mythology. The mythology of Iran was greatly influenced by the myths of the native peoples of the Iranian plateau and the myths of the Middle River. Researchers have shown these influences in many places in Iranian mythology. Indian and Iranian mythology are close in many ways. This proximity is sometimes to the extent of the similarity of the names of persons and places. The close languages of these two groups also confirm their common roots; Therefore, the origin of the mythology of these two nations has been the same in the distant past, but the migration of Indians from the Aryan plateau to lands with different nature and climatic conditions, as well as indigenous peoples, has brought about fundamental changes in their mythology and religious beliefs. There are good and evil forces in both of these myths. The names of their gods are close to each other. Fire is sacred and praised in Iranian and Indian beliefs, and they used to perform sacrifices for the gods in a similar manner. The oldest examples of the ancient form of Iranian mythology are references in Avesta, especially in Yashta. Because Yashta are above all a collection of prayer hymns, there are no detailed references to myths in them. Everything is closed and short. The most detailed texts about Iranian mythology are in Zoroastrian writings in Middle Persian. The final compilation of most of them is in the early Islamic era; But most of them are based on the texts of the late Sasanian period. Some of the most famous of these books are &quot;Bundahisn,&quot; &quot;Denkard&quot; and the &quot;Vendidad&quot;. The other major source for Persian mythology is the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (“The Book of Kings”) written by the Persian poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi (940-1020 CE).

== Overview of the world ==
In the mythological beliefs of Iranians before Zoroastrian, the world was round and flat like a plate. The sky was also imagined as stone and hard as a diamond. The earth in the center was completely flat and untouched, and there was no movement between the earth, the moon, and the stars. But everything changed by Ahura Mazda. The dynamism arose, the mountains were created, the rivers flowed, and the moon and stars began to rotate. In the general picture of the world at that time, the world was divided into seven regions, the center of which was called Khoonirth, and six satellite lands were around it. The sky had three levels of star base, moon base and sun base. Dark Mountain, which was located in Alborz, was considered the center of the universe. The message of Iranian myths is the confrontation of two gems of good and evil. One is truth and the other is untruth, one is fragrant and the other is bright, one is light and the other is darkness. In fact, serving good concepts is still one of the great mythological messages of Iran.

== Evil Forces ==

In Iranian mythology, what can be seen everywhere in all mythological narratives is the presence of evil and evil forces in the world. These evil forces, which are considered to be the assistants of Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), are mentioned by the names of Div and Druq. These two have male and female genders, and against every good thing in the world. In Iranian mythology, the world is always the scene of conflict between these evil and good forces.

== Ahura Mazda and Ahriman ==
Ahura Mazda and Ahriman have been at war with each other since eternity, and life in the world is a reflection of the cosmic struggle of the two. Ahriman&#x27;s place of residence is the north of the earth, where the whole divan of &quot;Zeed and Islah&quot;. Ahriman appears in 3 forms other than his image: Chelpasa (lizard), Snake and Young. Although he is mentioned in the Shahnameh of the Mardosh kingdom, in the Avesta he is a three-headed, six-eyed and three-nosed demon with a body full of scorpions. However, based on Zoroastrian writings, in the final days of the world, it is Ahura Mazda who will win over Ahriman and destroy him forever, and after that only goodness, light and health will remain in the world. 

== Myths of creation and the end of the world ==

Creation takes place within twelve thousand mythological years. These twelve thousand years are divided into four periods of three thousand years. The first three thousand years begins with the birth of two children named Ahura Maza and Ahriman from Zarvan. In the first three thousand years, the world is Minoan and there is still neither place nor time. In this period, two entities are mentioned. One is the world belonging to Ahura Maza, which is full of light, life, knowledge, beauty, and fragrance, and the second is the world belonging to Ahriman, which is dark, ugly, smelly, and full of sorrow and disease. Ahura Maza first creates Amesha Spenta, which are: Sepand Mino, Khordad, Mordad, Bahman, Ordibehesht, Shahrivar and Spandarmad. After the creation of Amshaspandan, Ahura Mazda creates the gods. Ahriman also creates Sardivan for each of Amshaspandans to deal with Ahura Maza. At the end of the first three thousand years, a peace is made between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman that the last battle between the forces of evil and good will take place nine thousand years later. After the pact is concluded, Ahura Mazda utters the true prayer, Ahunur, and as a result, Ahriman falls to hell and remains unconscious there for the second three thousand years.

The second three thousand years: After Ahriman&#x27;s unconsciousness, Ahura Mazda begins the creation of the world. He creates the sky, water, earth, plants, animals and humans in one year. The anniversary of these creations are six festivals, which are known as Gahambars. The main prototypes of creation are the cow, four-legged animals, and the human beings. At the end of the second three thousand years, Ahriman, with the help of his allies, returns and decides to destroy the current world.

The third three thousand years: in this period, we see the conflict of Ahriman and his demons with Ahura Maza and his gods. Meanwhile, Ahriman kills the created cow, grains, plants and animals are created. After 40 years, a rhubarb branch grows from the seed of Keyumars, which has two stalks and fifteen leaves. These fifteen leaves are in accordance with the years that Mishiyeh and Mishyaneh, the first Adam couple have at that time. Mishiyeh is male and Mishyaneh is female. Mishiyeh is known as the father of humans and Mishyaneh as the mother of humans. Ahriman attacks their thoughts and they utter the first lie and attribute creation to Ahriman. They both repent and have seven pairs of children and die after living for a hundred years. The genealogy of the descendants of Mishiyeh and Mishyaneh includes the origins of many different races. The Iranian race is from a couple called Siamak and Neshak. After them, Farag-Farwagin and after them the couple Hushang and Guzak are born.

The fourth three thousand years: The third three thousand years ends in the middle of the era of Kay Lohrasp. The most important feature of this period is the emergence of Zoroaster. This period is the period of religious revelation. Ahura Mazda reveals the secrets of religion to Zoroaster, and he declares himself a prophet of Zoroastrianism religion and his mission. Mazdaism is a religion that has Ahura Mazda at the head of their gods, and in other words, it is Zoroastrian religion. After Zoroaster&#x27;s death, Oshidar, Oshidar Mah and Saoshyant take over the leadership of Behdinan. Sushyant period is the period of evolution of Urmazdi creatures, and all divans from the generation of bipeds and quadrupeds are destroyed. Sushyant has the task of raising the dead. Each of these dead people pass through the Chinvat Bridge.

== Mythological history of Iran ==
Pishdadian dynasty: Pishdadians are the first dynasty of Iranian history according to mythological texts, which are related to Kay Lohrasp. This series of kings who brought the beginning of human civilization to Iranians and were able to record fire and use of metals and other living things and capturing the court in their records. It starts from Kay Lohrasp and ends at Garshasp. However, all these are mythological characters in the Avesta, and in the Zoroastrian texts of the Sasanian period, they are gods of the Izder race.

Kayanian dynasty: The Kayanians are the second mythological dynasty of Iran, which in Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh is equal to the epic periods. It starts with Kay Kawad and ends with the possessors. In this period, Zoroastrian religion is presented and we see fundamental changes in the mythological history of Iran. The most important events of this period are related to Iran and Turan wars. The story of Arash belongs to the narratives of this period. In the Shahnameh, it is associated with the epic, and in it Rostam, who is a less prominent character in Zoroastrian texts, rises to the top. These kings were probably considered the local kings of eastern Iran. Al-Biruni has compared the Achaemenids to the Kayanians in his works. However, it is clear that the last Kiyan king who is defeated by Alexander in mythological texts is the same Darius III of Achaemenid.

A fusion of mythological history and real history: This period corresponds to the time when the Iranian mythological narrative coincides with concrete historical data such as stone inscriptions and Greek texts; It means the fall of Iran at the hands of Alexander. However, the Iranian narrative considered the reign of Alexander and the Greeks to be very short, and did not assume any time for the Seleucids, it also estimated the period of 450 years of rule of the Parthians to be only 200 years. The final data of the Parthian era in Iranian mythology deals with the battle between Artabanus IV and Ardeshir I, which is the same as what was found in Latin and Armenian texts. After that, the Sassanid period begins, and they are introduced as descendants of the Kayanians.

== Life &amp; Afterlife ==
The one who chose to follow Ahura Mazda, would live a good life with others, and the one who chose Ahriman, will become a source of strife. Death is a journey to the afterlife, and the soul of the dead person has to cross the Chinvat Bridge. Good souls found the bridge to be a wide road leading to heaven, and for bad souls who chose to follow Ahriman during their life, they fell from the bridge into hell.

== Gods ==

* Ahura Mazda: the creator deity and god of the sky. He is the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the Persian mythology. The literal meaning of the word &quot;Ahura&quot; is &quot;lord&quot;, and that of &quot;Mazda&quot; is &quot;wisdom&quot;. 
* Angra Mainyu (Ahriman): the &quot;destructive/evil spirit&quot; and the main adversary in Zoroastrianism either of the Spenta Mainyu, the &quot;holy/creative spirits/mentality&quot;, or directly of Ahura Mazda. 
* Mithra: The god of covenants, light, oath, justice, the sun, contracts, and friendship. Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing protector of Truth, and the guardian of cattle, the harvest, and the Waters. The Romans attributed their Mithraic mysteries to Zoroastrian Persian sources relating to Mithra. Since the early 1970s, the dominant scholarship has noted dissimilarities between the Persian and Roman traditions, making it, at most, the result of Roman &quot;perceptions&quot; of Zoroastrian ideas.
* Anahita: goddess and appears in complete and earlier form as Aredvi Sura Anahita, associated with fertility, healing and wisdom. There is also a temple named Anahita in Iran. The symbol of goddess Anahita is the Lotus flower. Lotus Festival (Persian: Jashn-e Nilupar) is an Iranian festival that is held on the end of the first week of July. Holding this festival at this time was probably based on the blooming of lotus flowers at the beginning of summer.
* Rashnu: Rashnu is one of the three judges who pass judgment on the souls of people after death. Rashnu&#x27;s standard appellation is &quot;the very straight.&quot; The 18th day of every month in the Zoroastrian calendar is dedicated to Rashnu. The &quot;Counsels of Adarbad Mahraspandan&quot;, a Sassanid-era text, notes that on the 18th day &quot;life is merry&quot;.
* Verethragna: The neuter noun &quot;verethragna&quot; is related to Avestan &quot;verethra&quot;, &#x27;obstacle&#x27; and &quot;verethragnan&quot;, &#x27;victorious&#x27;. Representing this concept is the divinity Verethragna, who is the hypostasis of &quot;victory&quot;, and &quot;as a giver of victory Verethragna plainly enjoyed the greatest popularity of old.
* Vayu-Vata: divinity of the wind (Vayu) and of the atmosphere (Vata). The names are also used independently of one another, with &#x27;Vayu&#x27; occurring more frequently than &#x27;Vata&#x27;, but even when used independently still representing the other aspect. The entity is simultaneously angelic and demonic, that is, depending on the circumstances, either &quot;yazata&quot; - &quot;worthy of worship&quot; - or &quot;daeva&quot;, which in Zoroastrian tradition is a demon. Scripture frequently applies the epithet &quot;good&quot; when speaking of one or the other in a positive context.
* Tishtrya: benevolent divinity associated with life-bringing rainfall and fertility. Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. In the Zoroastrian religious calendar, the 13th day of the month and the 4th month of the year are dedicated to Tishtrya/Tir, and hence named after the entity. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits its month names from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 4th month is likewise named Tir.
* Atar: Zoroastrian concept of holy fire, sometimes described in abstract terms as &quot;burning and unburning fire&quot; or &quot;visible and invisible fire&quot;. It is considered to be the visible presence of Ahura Mazda and his Asha through the eponymous Yazata. The rituals for purifying a fire are performed 1,128 times a year.
* Haoma: a divine plant in Zoroastrianism and in later Persian culture and mythology. &quot;Haoma&quot; has its origins in Indo-Iranian religion and is the cognate of Vedic &quot;soma&quot;.
* Zorvan: Zurvan was perceived as the god of infinite time and space and also known as &quot;one&quot; or &quot;alone.&quot; Zurvan was portrayed as a transcendental and neutral god without passion; one for whom there was no distinction between good and evil. The name &quot;Zurvan&quot; is a normalized rendition of the word, which in Middle Persian appears as either &quot;Zurvān&quot;, &quot;Zruvān&quot; or &quot;Zarvān&quot;. The Middle Persian name derives from Avestan &quot;zruvan.&quot;
* Spenta Armaiti: Spenta Armaiti is the guardian and goddess of the green earth and a sign of fertility and birth.

== Creatures ==

* Simurgh: a benevolent bird. It is sometimes equated with other mythological birds such as the phoenix, and the humā, though it must be understood as a completely different mythological creature of its own. The figure can be found in all periods of Iranian art and literature and is also evident in the iconography of Georgia, medieval Armenia, the Eastern Roman Empire, and other regions that were within the realm of Persian cultural influence. 
*Chamrosh: a bird said to live on the summit of Mount Alborz, described as having the body of a dog/wolf with the head and wings of an eagle. It was said to inhabit the ground beneath the soma tree that was the roost of the Senmurv. When the Senmurv descended or alighted from its roost, all the ripened seeds fell to the earth. These seeds were gathered by the Chamrosh, which then distributed them to other parts of the earth. Chamrosh is the archetype of all birds, said to rule and protect all avifauna on Earth. According to the Avesta, Iran is pillaged every three years by outsiders, and when this happens, the angel Burj sends Chamrosh out to fly onto the highest mountaintop then snatch the pillagers in its talons as a bird does corn.
*Huma: is a mythical bird, continuing as a common motif in Sufi and Diwan poetry. Although there are many legends of the creature, common to all is that the bird is said never to alight on the ground, and instead to live its entire life flying invisibly high above the earth. Huma bird is said to never come to rest, living its entire life flying invisibly high above the earth, and never alighting on the ground (in some legends it is said to have no legs). In several variations of the Huma myths, the bird is said to be phoenix-like, consuming itself in fire every few hundred years, only to rise anew from the ashes. The Huma bird is said to have both the male and female natures in one body, each nature having one wing and one leg. Huma is considered to be compassionate, and a &#x27;bird of fortune&#x27; since its shadow is said to be auspicious. In Sufi tradition, catching the Huma is beyond even the wildest imagination, but catching a glimpse of it or even a shadow of it is sure to make one happy for the rest of one&#x27;s life. It is also believed that Huma cannot be caught alive, and the person killing a Huma will die in forty days.
*Al: a class of demon. Als are demons of childbirth, interfering with human reproduction. 
*Khrafstra: a cover term in Zoroastrianism for the animals that are harmful or repulsive. They were considered creations of the Evil Spirit Angra Mainyu and killing them was seen as meritorious. In the Young Avesta and Middle Persian texts, the class of xrafstars includes frogs, reptiles, scorpions and insects like ants or wasps, whereas predators such as the wolf are not referred to as xrafstars, even though they too are considered to be creations of evil. Herodotus narrates about the practice of killing xrafstars among the Magi: &quot;The Magi are a very peculiar race, different entirely from the Egyptian priests, and indeed from all other men whatsoever. The Egyptian priests make it a point of religion not to kill any live animals except those which they offer in sacrifice. The Magi, on the contrary, kill animals of all kinds with their own hands, excepting dogs and men. They even seem to take a delight in the employment, and kill, as readily as they do other animals, ants and snakes, and such like flying or creeping things&quot;

*Peri: exquisite, winged spirits renowned for their beauty. They are described in one reference work as mischievous beings that have been denied entry to paradise until they have completed penance for atonement.
*Div: monstrous creatures within Middle Eastern lore, with Persian origins. They exist along with jinn, &quot;peri&quot; and &quot;shayatin&quot;.They are described as having a body like that of a human, only of gigantic size, with two horns upon their heads and teeth like the tusks of a boar. Powerful, cruel and cold-hearted, they have a particular relish for the taste of human flesh. Some use only primitive weapons, such as stones: others, more sophisticated, are equipped like warriors, wearing armour and using weapons of metal. Despite their uncouth appearance – and in addition to their great physical strength – many are also masters of sorcery, capable of overcoming their enemies by magic and afflicting them with nightmares. In &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, they are already the evil entities endowed with roughly human shape and supernatural powers familiar from later folklore, in which the &quot;divs&quot; are described as ugly demons with supernatural strength and power, who, nonetheless, may sometimes be subdued and forced to do the bidding of a sorcerer.
*Aeshma: the Younger Avestan name of Zoroastrianism&#x27;s demon of &quot;wrath.&quot; Aeshma is variously interpreted as &quot;wrath,&quot; &quot;rage,&quot; and &quot;fury.&quot; His standard epithet is &quot;of the bloody mace.&quot;
*Div-e Sepid: In the Shahnameh, Div-e Sepid (White Demon), is the chieftain of the Divs (demons) of Mazandaran. He is a huge being. He possesses great physical strength and is skilled in sorcery and necromancy. He destroys the army of Kay Kavus by conjuring a dark storm of hail, boulders, and tree trunks using his magical skills. He then captures Kay Kavus, his commanders, and paladins; blinds them, and imprisons them in a dungeon. Rostam undertakes his &quot;Seven Labors&quot; to free his sovereign. At the end, Rostam slays Div-e Sepid and uses his heart and blood to cure the blindness of the king and the captured Persian heroes. Rostam also takes the Div&#x27;s head as a helmet and is often pictured wearing it.
*Manticore: a legendary creature similar to the Egyptian sphinx that proliferated in western European medieval art as well. It has the head of a human, the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion. There are some accounts that the spines can be launched like arrows. It eats its victims whole, using its three rows of teeth, and leaves no bones behind.
*Azhi (Dragon)

== Famous Myths ==

Persian myths is filled with famous heroes, to name a few: the greatest Persian hero is Rostam, who is the grandson of the hero Sām, and son of the equally Zal and Rudaba. Rostam was always represented as the mightiest of Iranian paladins (holy warriors). He rides the legendary stallion Rakhsh and wears a special suit named Babr-e Bayan in battles. In the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, Rostam and his predecessors are Marzbans of Sistan. Rostam is best known for his tragic fight with Esfandiyār, the other legendary Iranian hero; for his expedition to Mazandaran (not to be confused with the modern Mazandaran Province); and for tragically fighting and killing his son, Sohrab, without knowing who his opponent is. He is also known for the story of his Seven Labours. 

Another great hero is Jamshid (also given as Yama), who rules the world with justice. He is given power by the gods as a reward for his selfless devotion and uses it wisely. In Persian mythology and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the epigraphically unattested Pishdadian Dynasty (before the Kayanian dynasty). Edward FitzGerald transliterated the name as &quot;Jamshyd&quot;. In the eastern regions of Greater Iran, and by the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent it is rendered as &quot;Jamshed&quot;

Bahram, is an Iranian hero in Shahnameh. He is son of Goudarz and brother of Rohham, Giv and Hojir. In the story of Siavash, he and Zange-ye Shavaran are Siavash&#x27;s counselors. They unsuccessfully try to convince Siavash not to go to Turan. When Siavash goes to Turan and abandons Iranian army, Bahram is put in command of the Iranian army until the arrival of Tous. His most important adventure is in the story of Farud, where he fights with Turanian army along with other Iranian heroes.

Rudaba: a Persian mythological female figure in Ferdowsi&#x27;s epic Shahnameh. She is the princess of Kabul, daughter of Mehrab Kaboli and Sindukht, and later she becomes married to Zal, as they become lovers. They had two children, including Rostam, the main hero of the Shahnameh.

Rostam&#x27;s Seven Labours: a series of acts carried out by the greatest of the Iranian heroes, Rostam, The story was retold by Ferdowsi in his epic poem, Shahnameh. The Seven Labours were seven difficult tasks undertaken by Rostam, accompanied, in most instances, only by his faithful and sagacious steed Rakhsh, although in two labours he was accompanied also by the champion, Olad. 

Rostam and Sohrab: The tragedy of Rostam and Sohrab forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. It tells the tragic story of the heroes Rostam and his son, Sohrab.

Esfandiyār: a legendary Iranian hero and one of the characters of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. He was the son and the crown prince of the Kayanian King Goshtasp and Queen Katāyoun. He was the grandchild of Kay Lohrasp. Esfandiyār is best known for the tragic story of a battle with Rostam. It is one of the longest episodes in &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and is one of its literary highlights.

Vis and Rāmin: a classical Persian love story. The epic was composed in poetry by Fakhruddin As&#x27;ad Gurgani in the 11th century. Gurgani claimed a Sasanian origin for the story, but it is now regarded as of Parthian dynastic origin, probably from the 1st century AD. It has also been suggested that Gorgani&#x27;s story reflects the traditions and customs of the period immediately before he himself lived. The framework of the story is the opposition of two Parthian ruling houses, one in the west and the other in the east. Gorgani originally belongs to Hyrcania which is one of main lands of Parthians. The existence of these small kingdoms and the feudalistic background point to a date in the Parthian period of Iranian history. The story is about Vis, the daughter of Shāhrū and Qārin, the ruling family of Māh (Media) in western Iran, and Ramin (Rāmīn), the brother to Mobed Manikan, the King of Marv in northeastern Iran. Manikan sees Shāhrū in a royal gala, wonders at her beauty, and asks her to marry him. She answers that she is already married, but she promises to give him her daughter in marriage if a girl is born to her.

Faramarz: an Iranian legendary hero in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. He was son of Rostam and at last killed by Kay Bahman. The book Faramarz-nama, written about a hundred years after Shahnameh, is about Faramarz and his wars. He is also mentioned in other ancient books like Borzu Nama.

== Iranian mythology in the Islamic period ==

After Islam came to Iran, many Iranian myths were discarded or at least fell out of favor. Myths related to creation, actions of gods and supernatural forces in general, and predictions related to the end of the world are among them. Contrary to the mentioned cases, the deeds of mythological characters were transferred to modern Persian in the form of epics and preserved to a large extent. As the greatest epic work of Iranian history, Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh was written in the Islamic era. In terms of literature and epic, Shahnameh has great superiority over all the works of the previous eras. Some Iranians even tried to establish a kind of equivalent relationship between the mythological figures of these two completely different frameworks. So the time, place and mythological characters of the two mythological systems, Iranian and Semitic, were mixed up; For example, in Iranian mythology, the parents of man are Ayudamen (or Meshia) and Meshiani. In the Islamic era, some people equated Ayudamen with Adam, who is the first of the people in Semitic mythology, and it is the same. Along with the intermingling of Iranian and Semitic mythology, which increased with the passage of time, Iranian mythology continued to live and evolve among the Zoroastrian minority. One of the most important developments was the changes that took place in the predictions about the end of time. There were more references to the Tazi raiders and the new religion of the conquerors.

<text>The Citroën Xsara () is a compact C-segment family car, produced by the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroën, under their Citroën marque, from 1997 to 2006. The Xsara was a development of the Citroën ZX and Peugeot 306, which shared a platform and running gear.

It came in three and five door hatchback (notchback) and five door estate body styles; the estate was marketed as the &quot;Break&quot; and the three door as the &quot;Coupé&quot;. The styling shared cues with the larger Bertone designed Xantia, but was regarded as bland by the motoring press.

The straight four engine range includes 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre petrol engines as well as 1.4, 1.6, 1.9 and 2.0 litre naturally aspirated and turbocharged diesels. In some countries, such as Portugal, the 1.5 litre TUD5 diesel engine was also available. The Xsara was 1998 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.

==Chassis design==
The familiar range of PSA powertrains drove the front wheels of a seemingly conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën fully independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up, which was first introduced on the estate of the Peugeot 305.

However, PSA&#x27;s chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and inhouse developed and constructed shock absorbers.

At high mileages, this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.

The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted as far back as possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.

===Facelift===
In September 2000 for the 2001 model year, the Xsara was substantially facelifted with a new bonnet, wings, bumper, grille and headlamps with integrated fog lights. The rear end of the car saw slight changes to the light cluster and the introduction of a new hatch with a prominent logo. The car was now heavier (around 80 kg) and longer (21 mm). The body was made stiffer with A pillars and side-door beams reinforced. The tracks were also widened and 15-inch wheels were now sold as standard. Trims and materials were improved and the new steering wheel taken over from Citroen C5 enabled the installation of a bigger airbag. The instrument displays were now clearer with side and curtain airbags made available on higher trims. The facelift also saw the introduction of multiplex wiring.

New 1.6i and 2.0i 16 valve engines were being introduced and 1.8L were removed. Now Xsara is offered with following engine choices:

*1.4L (1361 cc 8 valve SOHC) TU3JP four cylinder petrol 121 N·m (catalyst and its position were changed).
*1.6L (1587 cc 16 valve DOHC) TU5JP4 four cylinder petrol (new, replaced 8-valve TU5JP engine)
*2.0L (1998 cc 16 valve DOHC) XU10J4RS four cylinder petrol (used till 2002)
*2.0L (1998 cc 16 valve DOHC) EW10J4 four cylinder petrol (new, replaced XU10 engine)
*1.4L (1398 cc) HDI 50 KW 68 PS DW4TD 01. 2004–31 December 2004
*1.5L (1527 cc) 43 kW (58 PS; 57 hp) TUD5 diesel
*1.9L (1868 cc) DW8 diesel (used till 2002)
*1.9L (1868 cc) DW8B diesel (new)
*2.0L (1997 cc) DW10TD turbodiesel (catalyst was changed, later central silencer was removed)
*2.0L (1997 cc) DW10ATED turbodiesel (new)

The model of 2002 had slight interior modifications (e.g. a different way of controlling the sound system from the steering wheel). In February 2003, there were also some exterior modifications (e.g. new front bumper, new instrument panel design with Eurostile typeface (to replace the Futura typeface) with dial design from the Peugeot 307).

The Xsara hatchback was discontinued in Europe, and replaced by the C4 in November 2004. Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile, a joint venture between Dongfeng and the PSA Group, continued to manufacture the Xsara hatchback one more year.

In Europe, the Xsara Estate continued to be produced until 2006 and did not get a replacement. The Xsara Picasso small MPV was continued, concurrently with its successor that was based on the C4, &#x27;Picasso&#x27; becoming the name for MPV derivatives of any Citroën model.

<text>Athersley is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England.

==History==
The site now occupied by the estate was once farmland and woodland. A large area from Lee Lane was known as Athersley Wood, which stretched nearly to Carlton Hill. The name was first recorded in 1379 as &#x27;Hattirslay&#x27;, probably meaning &#x27;Aethred&#x27;s forest glade&#x27; from the Old English &#x27;Aethe[l]red&#x27; and &#x27;leah&#x27;.

Construction began in post war Britain, near the end of the 1940s, under the direction of the then Building Administrator. The land, originally dense woodland populated by a variety of wildlife, proved difficult to prepare, yet the need for more housing gave rise to an influx of labourers, many of whom stayed on in the houses they helped to build. This undertaking was instrumental in the decision to build more homes around the region, including &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; of Athersley, which was later to become known as Athersley North. North and South are separated by a main B road, Laithes Lane. The adjoining estate of New Lodge is separated by Wakefield Road from Athersley North yet other estates surrounding the area have no noticeable separation, most notably Smithies and Monk Bretton.

Although woodland was cleared to make way for construction, remnants remain throughout the surrounding area, home to diverse wildlife, and ponds and creeks. Some of these areas are sanctuaries for the local wildlife, most recently Carlton Marshes, a lake or pond preserving water creatures and birds. This area was once home to Wharncliffe Woodmoor Colliery.

==Community==
The area is served by four primary schools, Holy Trinity Catholic and Church of England School (ages 3–16), Athersley North Primary School, Athersley South Primary School and Laithes Primary School. The local secondary schools are Holy Trinity Catholic and Church of England School (ages 3–16) and Outwood Academy Carlton,

The area is served by a variety of shops, many of which are located at the top of Laithes Lane at its junction with Wakefield Road. Shops include Poundstretcher and Co-op stores, cafes, bakers, butchers, a pet store, an alcohol retailer, and a barbers. There is a social club and a working men&#x27;s club.

<doc id="759353" wikidata="Q613254" url="?curid=759353" title="Pilatus Aircraft">
<text>Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. is an aerospace manufacturer located in Stans, Switzerland. In June 2016, the company employed 1,905 people.

The company has mostly produced aircraft for niche markets, in particular short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft as well as military training aircraft. During the 1950s and 1960s, Pilatus developed a short takeoff and landing (STOL) light civil transport aircraft, the PC-6 Porter. In 1973, it was decided to restart work on a turbine version of the piston engine trainer P-3, which entered production as the PC-7 Turbo Trainer. In 1979, Pilatus acquired Britten-Norman, manufacturer of the Britten-Norman Islander and Britten-Norman Defender aircraft. During the 1980s, it developed the PC-9, an improved derivative of the PC-7.

During the 1990s, Pilatus opened up a broader civilian market with the introduction of the PC-12, a single-engine turboprop aircraft and has delivered 1,800 as of April 2021. In the 2000s, it also introduced a new member family of its military training aircraft, the turboprop-powered PC-21. During the 2010s, the company developed the PC-24, a twin-engined STOL jet aircraft capable of operating from unpaved runways.

==History==

=== 1939–1949 ===
In August 1938 Vickers offered Spitfire aircraft to the Swiss &quot;Kriegstechnische Abteilung&quot; (KTA). Antoine Gazda, working as a sales manager for the Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon, negotiated a licence agreement with Vickers and offered swiss-built Spitfires to the Flugwaffe. On October 21, 1938, a society named «Studiengesellschaft zur Gründung einer Flugzeugfabrik AG» was founded and designated the future company to be located at Stans. However the authorities deciced to buy complete aircraft from Messerschmitt in Germany. Without the now obsolete «Studiengesellschaft», Emil Bührle and Gazda continued on the project and founded the Pilatus Flugzeugwerke AG with the help of Elektrobank on 16. Dezember 1939. Construction of a production building started in March 1940. After forming, the company obtained contracts to do maintenance and repairs for the Swiss Air Force. The first venture of the new company was the assembly of EKW C-35 reconnaissance biplanes from spare parts, along with overhaul work on other types.

The first company proposal to the Swiss Air Force was a single-seat trainer, designated the P-1, although no records exist of the work done on it and not even the name of the project was ever mentioned on the two drawings that were discovered in the federal archives. The next project was the detail construction of the SB-2 Pelican which had been designed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The five-seat experimental aircraft first flew on 30 May 1944 and only one of the type was built - resulting in a financial loss for the company that was higher than what it was ever paid for. 

In 1942, the company won a contract from the Swiss military to modify 33 EKW C-3603. Following on from the abandoned P-1 design, the company started again on the development of a two-seat trainer, designated the P-2. The P-2 first flew on 27 April 1945, and the company won an order for the Swiss Air Force.

During 1945, the company produced a prototype single-engined light transport, designated the P-4. It made its first flight on 22 March 1948, but only one P-4 was ultimately completed. During the late 1940s, the company produced a number of wooden glider designs, and also handled the production of fuselages and tail-booms for the licence-produced De Havilland Vampire and Venom.

=== 1950–1959 ===
During 1951, the company worked on the P-5, a design project for an artillery observation aircraft, but it was not built. The P-3 was put into quantity production for the Swiss Air Force, and the company also achieved its first export success with the type: an order for six P-3s by the Brazilian Navy.

During 1958, Pilatus began design work on a short takeoff and landing (STOL) light civil transport aircraft which emerged as the PC-6 Porter; this aircraft first flew on 4 May 1959. The Porter was also manufactured under license by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. Roughly 100 of these licence-produced aircraft would be completed, being mainly purchased by civil operators within the US.

=== 1960–1969 ===
The initial turbine-powered models of the PC-6 were equipped with the Astazou II powerplant, however complaints of the reliability of this engine were made. Another early turboprop powerplant that became available for the PC-6 was the Garrett Air Research TPE 331. Some operators such as Air America chose to retrofit their Astazou II-powered PC-6s with the TPE 331 engine in its place. Both the piston and turbine-engine versions of the PC-6 became quickly known for their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capabilities, requiring only a very short takeoff run before being ready for rotation prior to taking off.

Furthermore, during 1965, a twin-engined variant of the PC-6 was built as the PC-8 Twin Porter, although it first flew on 15 November 1967, the aircraft remained an experimental and one-off type, and development was stopped in 1972. Another project, the PC-10, a 16-passenger twin-engined transport, was also kicked off by the company; however, it was not ultimately put into production.

In 1966, a turboprop-powered variant of the P-3 was flown, and was designated the PC-7. This aircraft was lost in a crash, leading to development of the type being put on hold until the 1970s. The termination of work was reportedly driven by a lack of market interest at that time.

=== 1970–1979 ===
In a departure from the production of trainers and Porters, the company bought the rights to the all-metal B-4 glider; Pilatus re-designed the B-4 for easier production and redesignated at the B-4/PC-11. The PC-11 first flew on 5 May 1972 and the company went on to build 322.

During 1973, it was decided to restart work on the PC-7 programme; factors for its revival had included the 1973 oil crisis, the launch of the rival Beechcraft T-34C Turbo-Mentor, and the increasing age of existing trainer aircraft. In 1975, a further PC-7 prototype was flown; following further development, it entered production as the PC-7 Turbo Trainer. On 12 August 1978, the first production standard aircraft made its first flight; on 5 December of that year, Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) issued civil certification for the PC-7. Over time, sales of the PC-7 generated considerable profits, allowing the company to finance the development of further types of aircraft.

In 1979, Pilatus acquired Britten-Norman, constructor of the Britten-Norman Islander and Britten-Norman Defender aircraft; this move led to the business being restructured as the &quot;Pilatus Britten-Norman company&quot;. Shortly thereafter, production activity on the Islander/Defender family was transferred to its Bembridge. Under the new company&#x27;s direction, new features were installed upon the Islander over the years, such as the fitting of silencers upon both the aircraft&#x27;s engine and propellers to better facilitate operations in noise-sensitive environments.

=== 1980–1989 ===
During 1982, development of an improved variant of the PC-7 was started, it emerged as the Pilatus PC-9 in 1984. It retained the overall layout of its predecessor, but the aircraft had very little structural commonality with it. Amongst other improvements, the PC-9 features a larger cockpit with stepped ejection seats and also has a ventral airbrake. Certification was achieved in September 1985.

Development of what was to become the company&#x27;s best selling type, the Pilatus PC-12, was started in 1987, a single-engined turboprop transport that could carry up to twelve passengers or freight. In October 1989, Pilatus announced the development of the PC-12 at the annual convention of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).

=== 1990–1999 ===
The prototype PC-12 was flown on 31 May 1991. On 30 March 1994, the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation issued the type certificate for the PC-12; The first &quot;PC-12 Eagle&quot; surveillance aircraft was built in 1995, further developments led to the &quot;PC-12 Spectre&quot;; amongst other customers, it was adopted by the United States Air Force as the &quot;U-28A&quot;. Since entering service, Pilatus developed a large number of improvements and options upon the original PC-12 model; changes include increases in the maximum takeoff weight, the use of increasingly powerful engines, the adoption of new avionics, noise-reduction measures, new propellers, speed and range increases, additional interiors and new inflight entertainment systems.

During 1997, &quot;TSA Transairco SA&quot; of Geneva was acquired by Pilatus. In 1998, &quot;Pilatus Australia Pty Ltd&quot; was established, while Britten-Norman was sold.

=== 2000–2009 ===
To further its family of military training aircraft, the turboprop PC-21 was developed and first flown in 2002. A key aim for the PC-21 was to allow jet aircraft pilots to perform the majority of their training using the type before converting to jet-powered types, allowing operators to make substantial savings. In order to achieve this aim, the new trainer was required to have an expanded performance envelope in terms of aerodynamics, cockpit equipment, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. In May 2002, Pilatus announced that it aimed for the PC-21 to capture 50% of the global trainer aircraft market between 2005 and 2030.

In December 2000, the owners Unaxis (previously called Oerlikon-Bührle) sold Pilatus to a consortium of Swiss investors. During July 2010, the company delivered its 1,000 PC-12.

=== 2010–2019 ===
In 2013, Pilatus created a new overseas entity, &quot;Pilatus Aircraft Industry (China) Co., Ltd&quot;, to manufacture both the PC-6 and PC-12 aircraft in Chongqing, China; this company was run as a joint partnership between Pilatus and Beijing Tian Xing Jian Yu Science Co., Ltd. In 2014, the majority of PC-6s delivered that year were to Chinese customers. By April 2016, around 20 PC-6s were in operation in the Chinese market; the type has often been used to replace the Antonov An-2, being reportedly cheaper to operate.

The PC-24 was designed based on feedback from PC-12 customers, who desired increased range and speed, but wanted to retain the PC-12&#x27;s ability to use very short runways. The design program was first mentioned by Pilatus in its May 2011 annual report. On 21 May 2013, the PC-24 was introduced to the public at the European Business Aviation Convention &amp; Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva. At the event, the then Pilatus chairman Oscar Schwenk claimed the PC-24 did not fit into any existing business jet categories, and stated that the aircraft was the only one that combined &quot;...the versatility of a turboprop with the cabin size of a medium light jet, and the performance of a light jet&quot;. The rollout of the first PC-24, &quot;HB-VXA&quot;, was on 1 August 2014, Switzerland&#x27;s national day; the aircraft&#x27;s first flight was on 11 May 2015.

During 2018, Pilatus&#x27; general aviation division delivered 128 aircraft: 80 PC-12s, 27 PC-21s, 3 PC-6s and 18 PC-24s and its revenue was 1.1 billion Swiss francs (SFr.) ($1.0 billion) while order intake for the year was $980 million, boosting the company’s backlog to $2.07 billion. That same year, the company announced the closure of the orderbook for the PC-6 during summer 2018; the last example of the type was completed during early 2019 while parts production is set to continue for at least 20 years.

At the end of 2019, Pilatus recorded revenues of Sfr1.2 billion, which was principally generated via the delivery of 134 aircraft: 40 PC-24s, 83 PC-12NGs, and 11 PC-21s. This compared with revenues of SFr1.1 billion in 2018 on deliveries of 128 aircraft: 18 PC-24s, 80 PC-12NGs, 27 PC-21s and three PC-6s. As of May 2020,the company&#x27;s backlog stood at $2.1 billion.

==Locations==
Pilatus Aircraft has its headquarters, along with a production plant, on the Buochs Airport in the Swiss canton of Nidwalden. The headquarters and plant are in the municipality of Stans.

The company&#x27;s wartime founding called for a location far from Switzerland&#x27;s borders and right up against a ridge of Mount Pilatus. Original plans actually called for the factory to be built inside the mountain.

Besides its day-to-day role as an aircraft factory, the Stans plant is perhaps best known for its use as a location for the film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, particularly the exterior shots in which James Bond crashes his DB5 and is captured.

Besides its Stans plant, the Pilatus Group has operations in Adelaide, South Australia and in Broomfield, Colorado.

== Controversies ==

=== Violation of Swiss Arms Export Law ===
In 2019, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) launched an investigation into the company for providing logistical support and maintenance services to military aircraft in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirate, both involved in the war in Yemen. Pilatus Aircraft’s support of military operations in Saudi Arabia and the UAE was deemed a breach of Swiss export laws , which prohibit aiding military activities in countries involved in ongoing conflicts. In June 2019, the FDFA ordered Pilatus to halt its operations in both countries. Pilatus Aircraft appealed the decision. In 2021, the decision of the FDFA was annulled by the Federal Administrative Court based on &quot;incompatibility with the [Swiss] government&#x27;s foreign policy objectives&quot; 

=== Indian Bribery case ===
Pilatus Aircraft was implicated in a bribery scandal in India. In 2019, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into alleged corruption involving the sale of 75 PC-7 MkII trainer aircraft to the Indian Air Force. The $350 million deal, signed in 2012, was reportedly tainted by bribes paid to Indian officials to secure the contract.

Pilatus was accused of violating India’s Prevention of Corruption Act, with investigations revealing financial transfers to intermediaries and consultants allegedly involved in facilitating the deal. Indian authorities, as part of the inquiry, scrutinized the involvement of middlemen including notorious arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, who would have received $50 million through the Dubai branch of Offset India Solutions Private Limited. Pilatus refused to comment and India scrapped a contract to purchase a further 38 aircraft from the Swiss manufacturer.

<text>Wombwell () is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. In the 2011 census, data for the town was split between the ward of Wombwell and small sections that fell into the wards of Darfield (specifically the area south of Pitt Street, including Broomhill) and Stairfoot (specifically the area south of Aldham Crescent). Added together, these record the town&#x27;s population at approximately 15,316.

Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, its name may have originally been &quot;Womba&#x27;s Well&quot;, meaning &quot;well in a hollow&quot;.

==History==

Wombwell railway station (formerly Wombwell West) serves the Penistone and Hallam lines. Until 1959 the town had another station, Wombwell Central, on the Barnsley–Doncaster line; this was closed when the line lost its passenger service. Wombwell was home to two collieries: Wombwell Main and Mitchells Main. Wombwell is close to the large shopping and leisure facilities of Cortonwood, and also has a number of local business, from cafes to travel agents to high-street chains such as Wilko.

Wombwell has one main cemetery, maintained by a voluntary group, the Friends of Wombwell Cemetery. Two chapels stand in the cemetery, both Grade II listed buildings: one was transformed into a &quot;Peace Garden&quot; after a fire that destroyed its roof; the other has been renovated by the group to become a &quot;community hub&quot;.

Wombwell Urban District Council was the administrative body for the town from 1865 until 1974. The district also included Broomhill, Brampton, Aldham, Smithley, Lundhill, Jump and Hemingfield.

The Old Town Hall was completed in 1897.

<text>Doyle is a surname of Irish origin. The name is a back-formation from O&#x27;Doyle, which is an Anglicisation of the Irish (), meaning &quot;descendant of &quot;Dubhghall&quot;&quot;. There is another possible etymology: the Anglo-Norman surname &quot;D&#x27;Oyley&quot; with agglutination of the French article &quot;de&quot; (cf. Disney). It means &#x27;from Ouilly&#x27;, the name of a knight who originated from one of the places named Ouilly in Normandy, such as Ouilly-le-Tesson (Calvados, &quot;Oylley&quot; 1050), Ouilly-le-Vicomte (Calvados, &quot;de Oilleio&quot; 1279), etc. The relationship with the family D&#x27;Oyly is unknown.

The personal name &quot;Dubhghall&quot; contains the elements &quot;dubh&quot; &quot;black&quot; + &quot;gall&quot; &quot;stranger&quot;. Similar Scottish and Irish surnames, derived from the same personal name are: &quot;MacDougall&quot; / &quot;McDougall&quot; and &quot;MacDowell&quot; / &quot;McDowell&quot;.

During the Viking Age the term &quot;Dubhghoill&quot; was used to describe the Vikings—usually Danes—and the term &quot;Fionnghoill&quot; (&quot;fair foreigners&quot;) was used to describe Norwegians. There is uncertainty as to the exact meaning of these terms. If they do not refer to literal colours of hair, complexion, or apparel, the terms could denote &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; Vikings. If correct, the terms may distinguish different groups or dynasties, or perhaps represent ethnonyms referring to Danes and Norwegians respectively. Later, &quot;Fionnghall&quot; was used to describe Scottish Gaels from the Hebrides, and sometimes the Hiberno-Normans (or &quot;Old English&quot;). The most common term for the Hiberno-Normans was &quot;Seanghoill&quot; (&quot;old foreigners&quot;) to differentiate themselves from the &quot;Dubhghoill&quot; the &quot;new foreigners&quot; or &quot;dark foreigners&quot; who came to Ireland during Tudor conquest of Ireland.

The name &quot;Doyle&quot; is not found in any of the old genealogies which document other prominent Irish families. This has led many to maintain that the Doyles are of somewhat recent origin in Ireland. In 2014, &quot;Doyle&quot; was the ninth most common surname in Ireland. In consequence it is thought that there may be several different specific sources of the name. Doyles found in Ulster may be of Scottish descent, as the name was used for MacDowell. In the 20th century the principal locations of the surname were in Dublin, , Kerry and Cork.

<text>Dance Hall at Louse Point is the debut collaborative studio album by English alternative rock musicians PJ Harvey and John Parish, released on 23 September 1996 on Island Records. It was reissued on vinyl LP in October 2020.

==Background==
Parish wrote and played the music, while Harvey sang vocals and wrote the lyrics. The pair had been musical collaborators for several years before making this album together – as a teenager growing up in rural England, Harvey contributed saxophone, guitar and backing vocals to Parish’s band Automatic Dlamini before forming her own band in 1991. Parish later served as co-producer, guitarist, percussionist and keyboard player on Harvey’s 1995 album &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, and would also feature heavily on her 1998 album &quot;Is This Desire?&quot;.

The album was viewed by many PJ Harvey fans as a minor side project – perhaps due to the top billing accorded the more obscure Parish and her own accreditation as Polly Jean Harvey rather than the more widely recognised PJ Harvey name. The album consequently sold more poorly than any of her solo releases, entering the UK charts at #46 and barely denting the U.S. Billboard charts at #178 for one week. It yielded only one single, &quot;That Was My Veil&quot;, which spent a week at #75 in the UK charts. Harvey later admitted that she left all promotional duties for the record to Parish because she was exhausted following a year of intense promotional activity for her own &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; album in 1995. Reportedly, bosses at Harvey’s Island Records label feared the avant-garde venture was &quot;commercial suicide&quot;, despite it winning generally positive reviews: &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined, &quot;This is &#x27;deep&#x27; music in every sense; total immersion is recommended&quot;, &quot;Musician&quot; reckoned &quot;The results are as engaging as they are disturbing...full of strange moves and unusual textures&quot;, &quot;Logo&quot; felt it was &quot;thrillingly sinister&quot;, while &quot;Q magazine&quot; praised its &quot;polecat scat and brooding rural blues&quot;, adding that it felt &quot;more a series of themes and word paintings.&quot;

Speaking about the album to &quot;NME&quot; in 1998, Harvey explained &quot;I just really wanted to learn different things, and a lot of learning comes from working with other people. I tend to place more importance on lyric writing than music, and I wanted to somehow bring the music to a similar level with that, but I didn’t feel confident in myself as a musician to do it. I know John can write demanding and intellectual music, much more than mine, which is very simple. So it was really just to test my lyric writing.&quot; In 2001 she told &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;People don&#x27;t even count that, yet that&#x27;s the record I&#x27;m really proud of. It was an enormous turning point. Lyrically, it moved me into areas I&#x27;d never been to before. Faced with John&#x27;s music, which is so different to my own, it just made me write lyrics in a very different way and structure songs in a different way.&quot;

Parish and Harvey did a brief UK club tour with the Mark Bruce Dance Company in early 1997, performing the album’s experimental songs with a group of interpretive ballet dancers onstage.

In 2009 Parish and Harvey released their second collaborative album &quot;A Woman a Man Walked By&quot;.

<text>The area density (also known as areal density, surface density, superficial density, areic density, mass thickness, column density, or density thickness) of a two-dimensional object is calculated as the mass per unit area. The SI derived unit is the &quot;kilogram per square metre&quot; (kg·m−2). 

In the paper and fabric industries, it is called grammage and is expressed in grams per square meter (g/m2); for paper in particular, it may be expressed as pounds per ream of standard sizes (&quot;basis ream&quot;).

A related &quot;area number density&quot; can be defined by replacing mass by number of particles or other countable quantity, with resulting units of m−2.

== Formulation ==
Area density can be calculated as:

formula_2
where &#x27; is the average area density, &#x27; is the total mass of the object, &#x27; is the total area of the object, &#x27; is the average density, and &quot;&quot; is the average thickness of the object.

== Column density ==
A special type of area density is called &quot;column density&quot; (also &quot;columnar mass density&quot; or simply &quot;column density&quot;), denoted &quot;ρ&quot;A or &quot;σ&quot;. It is the mass of substance per unit area integrated along a path; It is obtained integrating volumetric density formula_3 over a column:
formula_4

In general the integration path can be slant or oblique incidence (as in, for example, line of sight propagation in atmospheric physics). A common special case is a vertical path, from the bottom to the top of the medium:
formula_5
where formula_6 denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth).

Columnar density formula_7 is closely related to the vertically averaged volumetric density formula_8 as
formula_9
where formula_10; formula_8, formula_7, and formula_13 have units of, for example, grams per cubic metre, grams per square metre, and metres, respectively.

==Usage==

===Atmospheric physics===
It is a quantity commonly retrieved by remote sensing instruments, for instance the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) which retrieves ozone columns around the globe. Columns are also returned by the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method and are a common retrieval product from nadir-looking microwave radiometers.

A closely related concept is that of ice or liquid water path, which specifies the volume per unit area or depth instead of mass per unit area, thus the two are related:
formula_14

Another closely related concept is optical depth.

===Astronomy===
In astronomy, the column density is generally used to indicate the number of atoms or molecules per square cm (cm2) along the line of sight in a particular direction, as derived from observations of e.g. the 21-cm hydrogen line or from observations of a certain molecular species. Also the interstellar extinction can be related to the column density of H or H2.

The concept of area density can be useful when analysing accretion disks. In the case of a disk seen face-on, area density for a given area of the disk is defined as column density: that is, either as the mass of substance per unit area integrated along the vertical path that goes through the disk (line-of-sight), from the bottom to the top of the medium:

formula_15

where formula_6 denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth), or as the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path (column number density):

formula_17

===Data storage media===

Areal density is used to quantify and compare different types media used in data storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical disc drives and tape drives. The current unit of measure is typically gigabits per square inch.

===Paper===

The area density is often used to describe the thickness of paper; e.g., 80 g/m2 is very common.

===Fabric===

Fabric &quot;weight&quot; is often specified as mass per unit area, grams per square meter (gsm) or ounces per square yard. It is also sometimes specified in ounces per yard in a standard width for the particular cloth. One gram per square meter equals 0.0295 ounces per square yard; one ounce per square yard equals 33.9 grams per square meter.

===Other===

It is also an important quantity for the absorption of radiation. 

When studying bodies falling through air, area density is important because resistance depends on area, and gravitational force is dependent on mass.

Bone density is often expressed in grams per square centimeter (g·cm−2) as measured by x-ray absorptiometry, as a proxy for the actual density.

The body mass index is expressed in units of kilograms per square meter, though the area figure is nominal, being the square of the height.

The total electron content in the ionosphere is a quantity of type columnar number density.

Snow water equivalent is a quantity of type columnar mass density.

<text>Drury Lane is a fictional detective created by Ellery Queen in the 1930s under the byline of Barnaby Ross. Later publications reverted to the Ellery Queen name. Lane is a deaf Shakespearean actor turned amateur sleuth.

==Character overview==
Lane was born in New Orleans on November 3, 1871. His father was a travelling American tragedian, and his mother an English music hall comic. Drury was born prematurely in a theater, his mother dying in childbirth. He was raised by his father, and made his acting debut aged 7. He was sixteen when his father died.

Lane became a highly celebrated Shakespearean actor, noted author of theatrical studies and biographies, and both a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and an honorary member of the French Legion of Honour. In 1928, he retired from the stage, having developed deafness. He became highly skilled in lip reading.

Upon his retirement, Lane decides to take up amateur sleuthing. He explains in &quot;The Tragedy of X&quot;, &quot;I think I can bring to this pursuit a rather unique equipment. I have murdered on the stage countless times; emotionally I have suffered the agony of plotting, the torture of conscience. I have been, among others perhaps less noble, Macbeth, and I have been Hamlet. And like a child viewing a simple wonder for the first time, I have just realized that the world is full of Macbeths and Hamlets.&quot;

Lane resides in &quot;The Hamlet&quot;, a castle overlooking the banks of the Hudson River, and accompanied by a small Elizabethan village, populated by people clad in authentic period garb and all bearing Shakespearean names. He is aided by Quacey (also known as Caliban and Quasimodo), his &quot;hunchbacked&quot; butler and formerly his makeup artist. Lane is also assisted by Inspector Thumm, and later by Thumm’s daughter Patience. 

Physically, he is tall and slender, with white hair and greyish-green eyes. Despite being in his 60s, facially he looks much younger.

<doc id="759363" wikidata="Q8033853" url="?curid=759363" title="Woolley Colliery">
<text>Woolley Colliery is a village in Wakefield district in West Yorkshire, England. The village is near the border with South Yorkshire. The former colliery was in the Wakefield Rural Ward in West Yorkshire. The village is known locally as Mucky Woolley, as a tribute to its coalmining heritage and to distinguish it from the more affluent village of Woolley two miles away.

Coal mines were worked as early as 1850, and at about that time the village was established when two rows of small terrace cottages were built to accommodate miners. There are several coal seam outcrops on the hillside and coal had probably been mined in the area for many years before, but only on a small scale until railway transport began. Woolley Colliery itself was established in 1869. The mine had three shafts, three seams (named Fenton, Lidgett and Thorncliffe), and five coal faces. Woolley Colliery was nationalised in 1947 and the majority of the coal mined there went to the production of electricity and coke. The pit grew to become one of the largest in West Yorkshire. In 1980 it employed 1514 men underground and 428 on the surface.

The colliery began when two tunnels or drifts were dug into the Barnsley bed seam in the hillside. Vertical shafts were sunk to reach the deeper seams. In the 1960s there were three shafts in the pit yard and a fourth, for ventilation, about a mile to the east. At that time around 17,000 tons of high-quality coal were produced each week.

Arthur Scargill, later the leader of the NUM, started work at the colliery in 1953, when he was 15. The pit was among the most conservative in Yorkshire, and Scargill was often in dispute with the branch leadership. He organised a strike in 1960 over the day on which union meetings were held, as he argued that these were deliberately being held at times when the sections of the workforce that were inclined to militancy were unable to attend.

==Miner&#x27;s Strike 1984–85==
During the UK miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985 roughly 70 per cent of the workforce at the colliery went on strike for a year, but the NUM branch leadership remained conservative about the use of flying pickets and union funds to help strikers. There were arguments with the lodge at North Gawber Colliery on contributions to a kitchen, as it was claimed that Woolley, which was a much larger pit, was making a minimal contribution to feeding strikers. After the strike the men from North Gawber were transferred to Woolley.

==Woolley Grange==

The pit was closed in 1987 and the buildings were demolished in 1993. The site is now home to a private housing estate, Woolley Grange. In 2023 further housing development plans on the site of the former colliery were opposed by local residents and ecologists on the grounds that the scheme would erode local identity and have an adverse effect on local wildlife. The proposed construction site covered a natural habitat housing a colony of the small blue butterfly, with the development plans leaving only the SUDS undeveloped.

<doc id="759365" wikidata="Q4020987" url="?curid=759365" title="Worsbrough">
<text>Worsbrough is a district 2 to 3 miles south of Barnsley in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. Before 1974, Worsbrough had its own urban district council in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Much of Worsbrough is now part of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council&#x27;s, Worsbrough ward, although certain parts of the historic Worsbrough district, such as Birdwell, Rockley and Blacker Hill, currently lie within neighbouring council wards.

==Geography==
The Worsbrough district includes three parishes; St James&#x27;s originally included the Suburbs of Worsbrough Bridge and Ward Green. St Thomas&#x27;s included Worsbrough Dale, Swaithe and Bank End. St Mary&#x27;s included Worsbrough Village, Birdwell, Blacker Hill, Worsbrough Park and Rockley. 

Worsbrough Common estate is a suburb of the Barnsley town centre area. It takes its name from the old common above Highstone Lane, which was the border betwixt Worsbrough and Barnsley. Although it takes its name from the old Worsbrough common, the modern Worsbro Common council estate was never part of the Worsbrough Urban District or Parish, but part of the County Borough of Barnsley. Furthermore, approximately one third of the common ground and fields used to build the Kendray council estate was on land within the Worsbrough Urban District, which was later swallowed up by the County Borough of Barnsley after the estate was constructed. 

Stainborough C.P. was formerly a sub division of the Worsbrough Urban District. 

The River Dove flows through Worsbrough and the reservoir before joining the River Dearne . The A61 traverses this large valley, before passing through Birdwell and junction 36 of the M1, in the direction of Sheffield. 

A railway line, the Worsbrough Branch line, linked to the former Woodhead Line, passed along the valley. It is now part of the Trans-Pennine Trail. 

The Worsbrough Branch railway line was primarily a coal freight line and started at Aldham from Wath and ended at West Silkstone Junction, where it joined the Barnsley-Penistone line. 

The Worsbrough Bank, sometimes referred to as the Worsbrough Incline, was a steep bank on the Worsbrough Branch of the Great Central Railway (GCR) freight-only line from Wath to Penistone, climbing for 7 miles (11 km), with a stretch of 3 miles (4.8 km) at a nominal gradient of 1 in 40 (2.5%). Sections of this incline also suffered from colliery subsidence, making it infamously difficult to restart a stalled train on these severe sections. The main traffic on the line was loaded trains carrying coal from the southern Yorkshire coalfields to Lancashire via the Woodhead Tunnel. 

The LNER Class U1 was designed solely for the Worsbrough Branch line, prior to electrification in the early 1950s. 

The Worsbrough Branch line was closed in 1981. 

The only passenger railway station in the Worsbrough District was at Dovecliffe, on the South Yorkshire Railway&#x27;s Barnsley to Sheffield line .The station was originally named Smithley for Darley Main &amp; Worsborough. The road from Worsbrough Dale to Dovecliffe is called Station Road. The Station closed in 1953, but freight traffic on the line operated for Rockingham Colliery until the late 1960s and the nearby Barrow Colliery, until the mid 1980s. The line was closed in 1986. 

The current Hallam Line and Penistone Line between Barnsley-Sheffield, both run through the Worsbrough area at Swaithe. 

===Landmarks===

Notable landmarks of Worsbrough include Houndhill, Rockley Old Hall, Rockley Furnace, Wigfield Farm, Worsbrough Hall, St Mary&#x27;s Church, also Worsbrough Mill and Worsbrough Reservoir, which are within Worsbrough Country Park. There is also remnants of a canal which was a branch of the Dearne and Dove Canal.


==History==
Worsbrough dates back to the 7th century, and is listed within the wapentake of Staincross,Yorkshire, in the Domesday Book:
In Wircesburg Gerneber and Haldene had five carucates of land and a half to be taxed where there may be four ploughs. Gamel and Chetelber now have it of Ilbert, themselves two ploughs, and four bordars, and one mill pays two shillings. Wood pasture half a mile long and half a mile broad. Value in King Edward&#x27;s time four pounds, now thirty shillings.
The name &#x27;Worsbrough&#x27; means &#x27;Weorc&#x27;s fortified place&#x27;. 

The historic centre of Worsbrough was what is now known as Worsbrough Village. It was colloquially referred to as Wusber/Wusper up until recent times, and is spelt as such on old maps.

Worsbrough was a largely farming and agricultural settlement prior to the Industrial Revolution. During the Industrial Revolution, there was a growing coal mining industry, plus iron foundries and several quarries across the Worsbrough District. The railway, canal system and better road links between Barnsley and Sheffield, also led to increased industry and migration to Worsbrough from other parts of the North, Britain and Ireland, and to the wider area as a whole.

Several coal mines in the industrial era were located in Worsbrough, more so in the east of the area, such as Swaithe Main, Martin&#x27;s Main, Worsbrough Park, Bell Ing, Kendall Green, Barrow, Mount Vernon, Edmunds Main and Darley Main.

With the rise of industry in the area and migration, came risks and due to unsafe and treacherous working conditions, many men and boys lost their lives, and families their breadwinners.

Several large pit disasters rocked the local community.

In 1849, 75 men and boys lost their lives in the Darley Main Colliery disaster in Worsbrough Dale. 

In 1862, another massive pit disaster occurred this time at Edmunds Main Colliery. Fifty-nine men and boys died in the explosions. 

Then, in 1875 at Swaithe Main Colliery, another explosion that led to the deaths of 143 men and boys, this was the biggest loss of life since the Oaks Disaster near Hoyle Mill, Barnsley.

There was several &#x27;lesser&#x27; pit disasters in the Worsbrough area, including the 1907 Barrow Colliery disaster, among others.

Today there are several memorials to those who lost their lives in local pit disasters, at churchyards in the area.

==Places of worship== 

===Church of England===
The Worsbrough Dale (St Thomas) parish covers the majority of the population of Worsbrough north of the river including Swaithe. It stretches up &quot;Hunningley Lane&quot; (B6100) as far as &quot;Birk Avenue&quot;.
Worsbrough Village (St Mary) church, south of the river near Worsbrough Hall and the parish covers most of the area of Worsbrough south of the river and includes Birdwell and most of the M1 between the river and junction 36.

====St Thomas and St James&#x27; Church====
On Bank End Road in Worsbrough Dale. The church was built in 1858 and consecrated in 1859. The Wentworth family of Wentworth Castle gave a donation of £2,000 and other people provided donations of smaller amounts or helped in other ways. The total cost of the church building was about £3,000. Listed as Grade II by Historic England. The church was originally called St Thomas&#x27;s, but after St James&#x27;s church in Worsbrough Bridge became a RC church, St Thomas took on St James&#x27;s name and Parish. St Thomas&#x27;s was the parish church of Worsbrough Dale, Swaithe and Bank End, until the addition of St James&#x27;s Parish.

====St Mary&#x27;s Church====
St Mary&#x27;s Church built over a thousand years ago, is a Grade I listed building in the tranquil setting of the historic settlement of Worsbrough Village. The Parish of St Mary&#x27;s covers, Worsbrough Village, Birdwell, Blacker Hill, and the rural areas of Worsbrough Park and Rockley.

====Church====

===Roman Catholic===

On West Street (B6100) in Worsbrough Bridge. Our Lady and St James Church. Built 1902 by T. H. and F. Healey of Bradford. Listed as Grade II by Historic England. The church was formerly a Church of England church known as St.James&#x27;. The Parish covered Worsbrough Bridge and Ward Green. 

===Community Church===

On High Street, Worsbrough Dale. The east elevation bears the inscriptions &quot;AD 1903&quot; and &quot;Ebenezer Wesleyan Reform&quot;. There are also foundation stones either side of the doorway inscribed with &quot;EBENEZER CHAPEL 1854&quot;. This suggests that the chapel was built in 1854 and extended upwards in 1903.

==Education==
The Barnsley Academy, before 2006 known as the Elmhirst School, provides secondary education to the area. It moved to a new site on &quot;Farm Road&quot;. Primary schools include Birdwell Primary School (formerly Worsbro Birdwell Junior&amp;Infants), Ward Green Primary School (formerly Worsbro&#x27; Ward Green Junior&amp;Infants), The Mill Academy (formerly St Edmunds Primary School, before amalgamation of Our Ladys RC Primary and Worsbro&#x27; Lobwood Infant School), Bank End Primary Academy (formerly Worsbrough Bank End Junior&amp;Infants) and Worsbrough St Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School. Worsbrough St Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School closed on 31 December 2007 as a consequence of falling pupil numbers. Other schools in the area now closed, were, Worsbrough Dale Junior &amp; Infants, Blacker Hill Primary (formerly Worsbrough Blacker Infants), Worsbrough High School (formerly Whitecross Secondary Modern).

==Sport and recreation==
Worsbrough Bridge Athletic F.C. are based in Worsbrough, next to the River Dove and currently play in the Northern Counties East Football League. The Trans Pennine Trail runs through Worsbrough along the path of a disused railway line. Outdoor bowls can be played at High Street Bowling Club in Worsbrough Dale and Kendal Vale Bowling Club in Worsbrough Bridge. Adjacent to Worsbrough Bridge Athletic F.C. and Kendal Vale Bowling Club is Worsbrough Bridge Cricket Club who compete in the Yorkshire Cricket Southern Premier League.

<text>Mapplewell is a village within the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, England. Formerly part of the now defunct Barnsley West and Penistone borough constituency, following the Boundary Commission for England&#x27;s report on South Yorkshire&#x27;s Parliamentary constituencies in 2004 and the subsequent inquiry in 2005, it is now part of the Barnsley Central borough constituency. The village currently falls within the Barnsley MBC ward of Darton East.

==History==
Mapplewell began life as a hamlet within the Staincross Wapentake. As it grew in size it began to merge with neighbouring hamlet, Staincross and ever since the histories of the villages have been linked together. As in Staincross, nail making was an important industry in Mapplewell in the 17th century. However, by the late 19th century mining was the predominant source of employment, after the sinking of a deep mine in North Gawber. In 1761, John Wesley preached in Mapplewell, at a time when villagers had to go west to worship at the church in neighbouring Darton. After Wesley&#x27;s visit, many chapels were built in the village, of which only a few remain.

==Geography==
Mapplewell lies around three miles north of Barnsley, and eight miles south of Wakefield situated at approximately and at an elevation of around 328 feet (100 m) above sea level.

==Education==
Mapplewell Primary School is in the village and was rated &quot;Outstanding&quot; by Ofsted in 2012.

==Sport==
The village was represented in the FA Cup by Mapplewell and Staincross Athletic F.C.

<doc id="759368" wikidata="Q2097233" url="?curid=759368" title="Station (Australian agriculture)">
<text>In Australia, a station is a large landholding used for producing livestock, predominantly cattle or sheep, that needs an extensive range of grazing land. The owner of a station is called a pastoralist or a , corresponding to the North American term &quot;rancher&quot;.

Originally &quot;station&quot; referred to the homestead – the owner&#x27;s house and associated outbuildings of a pastoral property, but it now generally refers to the whole holding. Stations in Australia are on Crown land pastoral leases, and may also be known more specifically as sheep stations or cattle stations, as most are stock-specific, dependent upon the region and rainfall.

If they are very large, they may also have a subsidiary homestead, known as an outstation.

==Sizes==
Sheep and cattle stations can be thousands of square kilometres in area, with the nearest neighbour being hundreds of kilometres away. Anna Creek Station in South Australia is the world&#x27;s largest working cattle station. It is roughly ; much larger than the runner-up, Clifton Hills, another South Australian cattle station spanning ; and substantially larger than America&#x27;s biggest ranch (King Ranch), which is only . King Ranch is approx 13% of the size of Anna Creek Station.

==Structure==
A station typically has a homestead where the property owner or the manager lives. Nearby cottages or staff quarters provide housing for the employees. Storage sheds and cattle yards are also sited near the homestead. Other structures depend on the size and location of the station. Isolated stations will have a mechanic&#x27;s workshop, schoolroom, a small general store to supply essentials, and possibly an entertainment or bar area for the owners and staff. Water may be supplied from a river, bores or dams, in conjunction with rainwater tanks. Nowadays, if rural mains power is not connected, electricity is typically provided by a generator, although solar electricity systems have become increasingly common.
===Outstations===

Historically, an outstation was a subsidiary homestead or other dwelling on Australian sheep or cattle stations that was more than a day’s return travel from the main homestead. Although the term later came to be more commonly used to describe a specific type of Aboriginal settlement, also known as a homeland community, it is still used on cattle and sheep stations today, for example the Sturt Creek Outstation of the Ruby Plains Station in the Kimberley, and Rawlinna sheep station, Australia’s largest operating sheep station.

===Facilities===
Because of the extended distances, there is a School of the Air so that children can attend classes from their homes, originally using pedal-powered radios to communicate with the teachers, developed by South Australian engineer and inventor Alfred Traeger in 1929. The larger stations have their own school and teacher to educate the children on the station until at least they commence high school. Large isolated stations have their own stores to supply workers with their needs.

Medical assistance is given by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (also originally using Traeger&#x27;s pedal radio technology), where medical staff such as doctors and nurses can treat patients at their homes, or airlift emergency and seriously ill patients to hospitals at the nearest towns. The Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service and RAC rescue helicopter and its trained medical crews also respond quickly to emergencies threatening the life, health and safety of people caused through medical emergency, illness, natural disaster, accidents or mishap.

==Personnel==
A station hand is an employee, who is involved in routine duties on a station and this may also involve caring for livestock.

Some stations are in remote areas that are not easy to access, limiting their population greatly. Accommodation for couples and families may be limited. An important example is the jackaroo (male) or jillaroo (female), a young person who works on a station for several years in a form of apprenticeship, in order to become an overseer or rural property manager. Aboriginal people have played a big part in the northern cattle industry where they were and still are competent stockmen on the cattle stations. Nowadays staff on these stations may work in the homestead and in stock camps. Stockmen, especially ringers, may be seasonal employees. Others include boremen, managers, mechanics, machinery operators (including grader drivers), station and camp cooks, teachers, s and bookkeepers. Veterinary surgeons also fly to some of the more distant cattle and sheep stations.

==Popular culture==
Jeannie Gunn arrived at Elsey Station in 1902, leaving after her husband died, and in 1908 wrote the book &quot;We of the Never Never&quot; based on her time on the property. Elsey also featured in the 1946 film &quot;The Overlanders&quot;. The crew set up camp on the property for a month, and the river crossing sequence was shot at the Roper River.

Writer Arthur Upfield spent many years working in the outback and on stations in many different jobs; he later described station life of the early 20th century in his novels.

The long-running television drama &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (20012009) is set on an Australian cattle station. The 2008 film &quot;Australia&quot; was set on the fictional station Faraway Downs; the movie was filmed on Home Valley Station.

The 2016 videogame &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI&quot; introduces Australia into the series, with one ability being a unique tile improvement called the Outback Station.

<text>The Inyo Mountains are a short mountain range east of the Sierra Nevada in eastern California in the United States. The range separates the Owens Valley to the west from Saline Valley to the east, extending for approximately south-southeast from the southern end of the White Mountains, from which they are separated by Westgard Pass, to the east of Owens Lake.

Geologically, the mountains are a fault block range in the Basin and Range Province, at the western end of the Great Basin. They are considered to be among the most important and best-known Late Proterozoic to Cambrian sections in the United States.

== Wilderness ==
Most of the mountain range () is designated as the Inyo Mountain Wilderness, managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the south and the United States Forest Service in the north. The USFS manages of the wilderness all within Inyo National Forest.

Wildlife in the area includes the endangered Inyo Mountains salamander and the desert bighorn sheep. Plant communities include creosote and sagebrush at lower altitudes, and bristlecone pine forests at higher altitudes. A number of rare and endemic plants are adapted to the unique limestone soils of the mountains, including the cliffdweller, bristlecone cryptantha, and Inyo rock daisy.

<text>Dodworth ( ) is a village in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it has a population of 5,742, increasing to 5,900 at the 2011 Census (9,777 for Dodworth Ward).

==History==
Dodworth was historically a township in the ancient parish of Silkstone in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, and an urban district in 1894. The urban district and civil parish were abolished in 1974, when Dodworth was transferred to the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in the new county of South Yorkshire. Dodworth is now an unparished area.

Dodworth is a former coal mining village with approximately 5,800 people. The land occupying the former pit is now the Dodworth Business Park. The &quot;muck&quot; stack from the pit is clearly visible throughout the village. The spoil heaps are now covered with grass, scrub and birch trees. Over the past twenty years, trees and wildlife have flourished. Now the whole of the east, south and west side are covered with trees. The north side is occupied by farmland and the former &#x27;muck stack&#x27; is completely invisible apart from the rise.
The crossroads between High Street, Station Road and Barnsley Road lead to Barnsley and Manchester. Dodworth&#x27;s High Street acted as part of a historical trade route for salt brought from Cheshire to Barnsley, proving to be one of the oldest trading routes in the area. Along High Street are a number of old weavers&#x27; cottages. Opposite the library is one of the village&#x27;s oldest buildings. It dates back to 1600, with evidence of this above its High Street front door.

==Current development==
There are established private housing estates at Baslow Crescent and Strafford Walk. Extensive newer housing is at the eastern side of Dodworth around Water Royd Drive and Rose Hill Drive. The Water Royd Drive area is often referred to as the &#x27;In and Out&#x27; estate by locals as many commuters from outside the village see this area as having easy access to the motorway links with house prices being reflective of their desirability. Further development is to the west with new housing at Champany Fields and Green Road, and luxury flats on Barnsley Road. These new homes are popular for commuters working in Barnsley, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds and many other centres. There is employment locally at the Dodworth Business Park and at Fall Bank Industrial Estate.

In the past few years house prices have risen sharply, reflecting the popularity of living in the village. The soon to be relocated railway station has direct lines to Huddersfield and Barnsley. A new hotel and Toby Carvery has been built on Capitol Park close to the M1 motorway junction.

The Dodworth Bypass, near junction 37 on the M1, was completed in early 2007. The bypass allows commuters to travel from central Barnsley, or the motorway, to Silkstone and surrounding areas without travelling through Dodworth. A new business park called Capitol Park, part funded through the European Objective One scheme, is under construction along the bypass.

Pharmaceutical company Galpharm International operate from a purpose-built distribution and office complex in the village.

A memorial dedicated to the miners killed in the industry has now been erected on the High Street.
A charity music festival was held at the Dodworth Miners&#x27; Welfare on 3 June 2012 to raise money for the memorial fund.

==Transport==

Proximity to the M1 Junction 37 means that Dodworth has a high proportion of commuters to Sheffield and Leeds. It also has easy access to Manchester along the A628 through Woodhead. Many people also work in Barnsley town centre, away.

Dodworth railway station, on the Huddersfield to Sheffield line, provides access to Barnsley centre, Sheffield, Leeds and other nearby towns and cities.

There are two leading bus companies operating through Dodworth: Stagecoach and Tates. Recently there have been changes to service routes in the village, diverting buses from the main road to less populated areas.

The new road system linking the motorway junction to the A628 towards Silkstone and Manchester, has bypassed what was once a busy thoroughfare, producing a much quieter and sought-after retreat for villagers.
==Education==
Dodworth has two primary schools, Keresforth Primary School and Dodworth St John the Baptist CofE Primary Academy. Dodworth St John (formerly Dodworth Junior School) amalgamated with Dodworth CofE Infant School in 2002.

Local secondary schools are Horizon Community College on Dodworth Road, and Penistone Grammar School in nearby Penistone.

Dodworth Branch Library is situated on High Street next to the war memorial. It functions as a local library, and provides internet access and &#x27;Study Support&#x27; for local children.

==Churches==
There are three churches in Dodworth, Dodworth Methodist Church, St John the Baptist Parish Church of 1844 by Benjamin Broomhead Taylor with three military graves, and Rosehill Wesleyan Reform Church on Keresforth Road adjacent to the school.
==Sport==
Dodworth F.C. represented the village in the FA Cup during the 1920s.

Dodworth MWFC currently play in the Sheffield County Senior premier division.

Dodworth Miners ARLFC was established in 2018 and competes in the Yorkshire Men&#x27;s Summer League; it&#x27;s predecessor Dodworth ARLFC (1980–2015) initially competed in the West Yorkshire Amateur League and later the National Conference League.
