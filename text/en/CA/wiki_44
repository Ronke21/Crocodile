<text>Air Europe was a wholly privately owned, independent British airline, established in 1978 under the working title Inter European Airways. It adopted the Air Europe name the following year. Its head office was in Reigate, Surrey, then in Crawley, West Sussex.

Its main operating base was at London Gatwick Airport where it commenced commercial airline operations in May 1979 with three brand-new Boeing 737-200 Advanced jet aircraft.

Air Europe was the brainchild of Errol Cossey and Martin O&#x27;Regan, two former Dan-Air executives, and Harry Goodman, who had founded Intasun Leisure during the early 1970s. Goodman became the airline&#x27;s main private financial backer, and in so doing expanded his role as chairman of the International Leisure Group (ILG), the parent company of both companies.

Air Europe was the main supplier of charter seats to Intasun Leisure, which grew during the 1980s to become the UK&#x27;s second-largest package tour operator (after the market leader Thomson).

Air Europe expanded during the 1980s with a major scheduled presence on short-haul European trunk routes taking off and landing at London Gatwick.

Towards the end of the decade it became the first non-state incepted airline to become pan-European, setting up subsidiaries elsewhere in Europe and it acquired two small airlines, forming the nucleus of a new Air Europe Express regional airline subsidiary. The acquired slots at Gatwick enabled it to increase frequencies as well as launch new scheduled routes. By the end of the decade it had become Gatwick&#x27;s largest resident airline operator.

Air Europe&#x27;s success came to an end – the cost of borrowing rose (to the detriment of highly debt-leveraged companies) and financial problems beset its parent company from late 1989 thus ILG and its UK-based subsidiaries – including Air Europe – went bankrupt on 8 March 1991.

==History==
===Background to formation===
Since its beginning in the 1950s, the UK package tour industry has been characterised by its cyclic trade (with pronounced periods of growth and contraction).

The first two periods of major growth had occurred during the mid-1960s and early 70s, respectively. These were followed by a period of major contraction during the mid-70s, mainly as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. This, in turn, was followed by renewed expansion during the second half of the 1970s.

The industry&#x27;s spurt of growth in the late 70s was accompanied by a growing shortage of whole-plane charter seats, which was further exacerbated by Laker Airways&#x27; decision to curb its short- to medium-haul charter activities, as a result of that airline&#x27;s increasing focus on its long-haul, transatlantic &quot;Skytrain&quot; scheduled no frills services, as well as by British Caledonian&#x27;s decision to withdraw completely from the market.

Therefore, a regional niche market opportunity arose specialising in short-haul.

====Radical departure from established practices in the charter airline industry====
During his time as Dan-Air&#x27;s associate director in charge of the airline&#x27;s operations, Errol Cossey oversaw the successful introduction of new jet aircraft types into Dan-Air&#x27;s fleet, beginning with the de Havilland Comet series 4 in 1966 and continuing with the BAC One-Eleven 400 series in 1969, the Boeing 707-320 &quot;Intercontinental&quot; in 1971, the Boeing 727-100 in 1973 as well as the BAC One-Eleven 500 in 1975. He assumed control over the charter fleet, numbering 28 aircraft during the mid-1970s. At that time, Intasun contracted a growing share of its business to Dan-Air. Intasun, like Dan-Air at that time, was shunned by doubtful writers as &#x27;no frills&#x27;. It was mainly competing on price with the other tour operators, notably market leader Thomson Holidays.

A factor behind Air Europe&#x27;s undercutting of prices while continuing to expand profitably was that it first waited for all the other operators to place their business with Dan-Air and only then placed its contracts, fitting in with whenever aircraft and crews were available. This meant that a lot of Intasun&#x27;s business involved mid-week and night flying. This, in turn, was a win-win for both operator and airline. It enabled Intasun to charter aircraft at substantially lower rates than its competitors, who had to pay a premium for chartering planes at weekend peak times and it permitted Dan-Air to increase its fleet&#x27;s utilisation, thereby boosting the company&#x27;s overall profitability. However, the high fuel consumption of Dan-Air&#x27;s &quot;mix&#x27;n match&quot; fleet – especially the Comets, which at that time made up the bulk of its charter fleet – against the backdrop of steeply rising jet fuel prices in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis made it more and more difficult to offer Intasun the rates at which it was prepared to contract its business to Dan-Air.

Errol Cossey became convinced that he could offer Intasun these rates without difficulty, and do a lot more business with it, if Dan-Air had more modern aircraft with a substantially lower fuel-burn and overall lower direct operating costs in its fleet. He was also aware that Britannia Airways, Thomson Holidays&#x27; sister airline and Dan-Air&#x27;s main rival in the charter market, had already begun building up a fleet of brand-new Boeing 737-200 jet planes, which had lower operating costs and a better operational performance than the older, second-hand jets operated by Dan-Air.

Therefore, Errol Cossey, Martin O&#x27;Regan, the group finance director of Dan-Air parent Davies and Newman, and Alan Snudden, Dan-Air&#x27;s managing director, tried to convince Fred Newman, Davies and Newman&#x27;s majority shareholder as well as Dan-Air&#x27;s long-serving chairman, that operating a brand-new fleet of Boeing 737-200 Advanced series jet aircraft – at the time the very latest, state-of-the-art aircraft – was the only way to secure Dan-Air&#x27;s long-term future as a major player in the charter airline industry. Their argument to Fred Newman was that operating the latest series 200 Advanced model of the 737 would not only give Dan-Air far better cost figures than any of the existing aircraft types in its fleet but would also allow it to leap-frog Britannia, which initially operated only the basic 200 model of the 737. That model lacked important enhancements, such as a short-field capability enabling operations at airfields whose runways were too short for the basic 737-200 model.

After failed attempts to convince Fred Newman of their plan&#x27;s merits, Errol Cossey, Martin O&#x27;Regan and Alan Snudden decided to leave Dan-Air.

Cossey presented the plan forged with O&#x27;Regan and Snudden. Goodman agreed to support it as an equity holder. This was the point at which Air Europe was incorporated (however Snudden decided to join Monarch Airlines.)

The fact that the charter airline industry—Dan-Air in particular—were shunned by some travel companies meant broad appeal was needed at the outset, especially in terms of on-board service, including the in-flight catering. Standards were set to rival the leading scheduled service airlines, with an aim of establishing a new benchmark for the industry and for charter airlines in particular; this would enable the new airline to fly longer seasons as travel companies were expected to cancel their contracts with rival airlines—an increase in aircraft utilisation that would translate into higher profits.

One of the ways in which the new airline was planning to set a standard for high-quality in-flight service was by completely revamping the seat-back catering practised by most contemporary charter airlines. At the time, this consisted of serving spam salad on all flights out and sandwiches back. This seemed to be a low-cost way of minimal catering on inclusive tours but was labour-intensive especially when taking into account that these meals needed to be prepared freshly several hours before departure. Caterers were charging for fresh preparation and seasonal produce. However, the salad leaves tended to wilt and the sandwiches acquired quickly staled due to the dry atmosphere inside an aircraft cabin. As a result, many passengers disliked the food. Thus Air Europe resolved to serve proper, restaurant-style meals including at least three courses – a starter, a hot main course and a dessert — on all flights, time permitting. This saw bulk-purchase of deep-frozen ingredients only to take advantage of lower rates. Eschewing inbound local catering, the frozen food could stay in the aircraft&#x27;s holds, which would generally not be filled to capacity. Other than operating only brand-new aircraft from the very beginning, this was a second unique selling point.

Improving profitability in a very competitive marketplace characterised by low profit margins and excess capacity were not the only reasons for exclusively using brand-new equipment – generous capital allowances for new equipment reduced tax liability, thereby increasing the enterprise value.

Legal affiliation to a tour operator (Intasun) gave indirect access to customers&#x27; deposits for use as working capital. This was of particular importance to reduce market barriers – the first plane had not yet arrived but it could meet up-front expenses. Also many suppliers would have to be paid in February – the dead season – before the summer flying programme commenced in April.

To attract higher-margin business from upmarket tour operators Air Europe was chosen from a short-list, which aimed to distance Air Europe from Intasun.

====Long-term strategic planning instead of opportunistic growth====
Cossey and O&#x27;Regan consciously rejected a second-hand fleet, variable food and ephemeral expansion: from the late 1940s until the early 1960s a short-termist approach was typical for new independent airlines, being critical of the undercutting, opportunistic risks taken by Dan-Air, an airline that became highly diversified – many of its sectors never turned a profit. This weakness overwhelmed its management with activities that were seeing a negative return on investment. Dan-Air justified a diversification strategy by its low marginal cost as aircraft and crews were already available. For many years for Dan-Air each aircraft type represented a &quot;cost centre line&quot; that was financially accountable for itself.

A typical example of Dan-Air&#x27;s opportunistic diversification into activities was its long-term commitment to start a comprehensive network of regional scheduled services linking secondary airports across Europe, many of which operated on a seasonal basis only. This took up massive resources – financial and managerial. It never became a financial success.

Cossey and O&#x27;Regan therefore honed in on low-risk activities, specifically few but core activities.

Their long-term strategic plan was to penetrate the market for:

* Short-/medium-haul charter flights.
* Long-haul charter flights.
* Scheduled services serving markets where half of the available capacity could be profitably filled with Intasun customers.
* Air Europe branded airlines in other European countries.

A particular financial strength was:
* Favourable finance leases of new aircraft allowing it to take on more debt (such as further leases) against their fixed residual dollar valuations.

===Beginning===
Air Europe became the first British charter airline to use new equipment from the outset and provide food and service that were reviewed to be comparable to established scheduled carriers.

Due to the package tour industry&#x27;s seasonality, Air Europe needed to ensure that it had high capacity through the entire June–September peak season: the airline needed to have finance in place to pay up-front for the deposits to take over the delivery slots of three brand-new Boeing 737-200 Advanced aircraft that had originally been booked by another airline that been forced to cancel its order. Financing these aircraft, which were due to roll off Boeing&#x27;s production line during May 1979, was its biggest challenge of that year.

In the late 1970s major financiers were reluctant to provide start-up capital to newly constituted airlines (dubbed &#x27;paper&#x27;) unless part of or enjoyed the backing of well-financed organisations. Their reluctance was based on a decade-long high failure rate of UK airline ventures. Therefore, Air Europe&#x27;s promoters were compelled to approach non-UK institutions, lenders and venture capitalists.

Ultimately, C. ITOH and the Marubeni Corporation, two Japanese conglomerates, whose commercial activities included purchasing brand-new aircraft from the United States and leasing them on to non-US airlines as part of Japan&#x27;s effort to reduce the then huge trade imbalance with the US, were prepared to lend Air Europe the required amount, following complex and lengthy negotiations. The type of aircraft finance Air Europe procured from C. ITOH and Marubeni was known as &quot;Samurai&quot; leasing. It consisted of a combination of full repayment mortgage and partial repayment (hire purchase) finance spread over ten years for each aircraft. Boeing provided their deficiency guarantees underwriting greatly the Japanese financiers&#x27; outstanding loans (equal to fair depreciated resale values).

Air Europe&#x27;s first commercial air service was on 4 May 1979, with a brand-new, 130-seat Boeing 737-2S3 Advanced, named &quot;Adam&quot; (registration G-BMHG) flying Gatwick to Palma de Mallorca with a full passenger load, flight KS 1004. The second plane was delivered to Gatwick that day. The last of the batch of the three arrived, post-testing, likewise on 31 May 1979, in time for the start of the peak operating season.

Air Europe became the first new UK charter airline to be profitable during its first year of operation.

===Becoming a major player in the charter airline industry===
The first year&#x27;s success instilled stakeholder confidence and gave a financial platform.

Air Europe opened its second base at Manchester Airport in the autumn of 1979 and became its fastest-growing UK departure point for a few years.

A major reorganisation was completed in 1981 when Intasun became a unified company, leading to its first flotation as Intasun Leisure Group plc on the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s then Unlisted Securities Market. In 1987, the group, which by then had become the International Leisure Group (ILG), delisted from London&#x27;s stock exchange proper.)

A third base opened at Cardiff Airport in 1982 when Air Europe&#x27;s core fleet consisted of seven from-new Boeing 737-200 Advanced aircraft. A further three operated under a swap-lease arrangement with Air Florida between May and September. Air Europe expected to carry 1.2 million passengers during 1982.

1982 was the year Air Europe:
*took over the purchase agreement of British Airways for a pair of brand-new Boeing 757-200 aircraft to arrive 1983 and 1984. These were among 19 the UK &#x27;flag carrier&#x27; had placed with Boeing prior to starting BA&#x27;s privatisation process which as such had become surplus to its strict requirements.
*ordered five Boeing 737-300s but with deliveries from 1987.

Intasun Leisure Group plc&#x27;s annual results for the financial year to the end of March 1983 were released in August. These results showed that the group&#x27;s pre-tax profit for that period was £6.8 million (up 26% on the year before, namely as the travel operator alone) and that the group carried 1.26 million passengers, most of whom by Air Europe. Air Europe accounted for half of the profit.

Air Europe&#x27;s first Boeing 757 named &quot;Fiona&quot; (registration G-BKRM) operated its maiden commercial flight on 24 April 1983, between Gatwick and Faro. The airline&#x27;s second 757 (G-BPGW) entered commercial service on 29 March 1984, between Gatwick and Milan. An order for a third, the first directly ordered from Boeing, followed in 1984 and further such aeroplanes operated.

During the early 1980s the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began rethinking its policy on the minimum number of engines an aircraft needed to be permitted to fly long distances non-stop over water. The FAA&#x27;s rethink had been prompted by the increasing reliability of jet engines powering new widebodied airliners as well as other technological advances. Mid-air engine shutdowns that necessitated an emergency landing at the nearest diversion airfield and which could harm the structure and/or occupants had become a rare phenomenon. The result was ETOPS, a set of rules permitting twin-engined aircraft to fly long over water routes, provided that there were usable diversion airfields within 120 minutes&#x27; non-stop flying distance plus a 15% margin from the aircraft&#x27;s route.

Following the introduction of the new rules in the mid-1980s, Air Europe became one of the first airlines to have its 757s ETOPS-equipped to take advantage of the aircraft&#x27;s design range, which was sufficient to permit non-stop flights to the East coast of North America, the Caribbean and Central America as well as certain parts of South America and Asia.

This enabled Air Europe to become the first British charter airline to operate its 757s on transatlantic charter flights between various points in the UK and Orlando, Florida, from 1989.

The first three planes were sold in April 1985 when the company cashed in on their dollar-denominated residual values. The contractual ability to sell in this way meant keeping the fleet young with a policy or replacing planes whenever residual values happened to exceed the costs of leasing new replacements, such as capacity temporarily leased in from other operators.)

Air Europe placed an initial order for five, larger 400 series Boeing 737s. These aircraft were delivered during 1989.

ILG&#x27;s 1989 annual report, which covered financial and operational performance during Air Europe&#x27;s tenth anniversary had summary statistics:

* Group operating profit of £35.5 million.
* 31 jet aircraft operated across the group.
* 20 scheduled routes.
* Total surplus aircraft valuations of £360 million.
* A combined share of 20% of all slots at London Gatwick.
* Total passenger numbers for all the group&#x27;s airlines of 5.8 million.
* Total passenger numbers for all the group&#x27;s tour operators of 2.7 million.

Each of these was a record for these benchmarks.

===Aircraft leasing===
Air Europe frequently used day-to-day operating leases as well as finance leases.

The former includes long-term swaps of surplus capacity with other airlines whose seasonality was opposite to Air Europe&#x27;s as well as short-term leases for temporary capacity shortfalls.

The latter is an efficient secured finance method to pay for aircraft, whereby these aircraft are sold to related or external lessors from whom they are then leased back, with the airline retaining a substantial interest in the aircraft&#x27;s residual values.

The charter airline business was highly seasonal, with most of the annual commercial activity taking place over a relatively short period of barely four months between the end of May and the beginning of September. As Air Europe was operating a fleet of brand-new aircraft that incurred high financing charges unlike the older, second-hand jets operated by Dan-Air and many other rival airlines, it could not afford to kerb its fleet utilisation over the winter months. Dan-Air, by contrast for example took half of its operational Comet fleet out of service at the end of the 1976 summer season and put the aircraft into storage at Dan-Air Engineering&#x27;s main base at Lasham Airfield the following winter season and saw reduced use of other aircraft in the winter. Dan-Air was able to do this as these predominantly older, second-hand aircraft had much lower acquisition costs and were already largely or fully depreciated at the time they entered its fleet.

Air Europe therefore sought business partners whose seasonality was counter-cyclical to its own so that its surplus aircraft could be leased out to other operators in winter and those operators&#x27; surplus capacity could be leased in for the busy summer period. Air Europe agreed an aircraft lease-swap with Air Florida, which commenced at the start of the 1980/81 winter season. Under this deal, Air Europe leased three of its aircraft to Air Florida to cover that airline&#x27;s peak season, which occurred in winter. In return, Air Florida leased two of its aircraft to Air Europe to cover the UK airline&#x27;s summer peak period. The number of aircraft Air Europe leased from Air Florida during the summer months subsequently increased to three.

Although this arrangement initially worked to both airlines&#x27; satisfaction, Air Europe decided to terminate it at the end of the 1982/83 winter season due to Air Florida&#x27;s growing financial problems such as paying its rent on time. Further not all aircraft returned to the UK on time along with the aircraft Air Florida was contractually obliged to supply from its own fleet at the start of the UK carrier&#x27;s summer season.)

Air Europe replaced the defunct deal with a similar arrangement with British Airways, which it had negotiated with the UK flag carrier in 1982. (This was part of a wider deal that had resulted in Air Europe purchasing two brand-new Boeing 757s from British Airways (BA).)

The Air Europe—BA aircraft swap lease involved BA leasing back the two 757s it had sold to Air Europe along with a number of that airline&#x27;s 737s to cover the shortfall resulting from aircraft being taken out of service during the winter when BA&#x27;s scheduled maintenance occurred. This deal lasted from 1983 until 1986.

An example for a short-term lease to bridge a capacity shortfall was Air Europe&#x27;s intended lease of a pair of Boeing 747s to enable the launch of a new long-haul charter programme in 1989.

The launch of this programme in May 1989 necessitated the temporary lease of suitable wide-body aircraft capacity as Air Europe did not have any aircraft suited to this type of operation in its fleet. The original intention was to lease two 460-seat Boeing 747s.

In the event, Air Europe leased a single, 486-seat Boeing 747 from US supplemental carrier Tower Air to operate its long-haul charter services to Bangkok, Barbados, Orlando and Acapulco on an ACMI basis.

===Pan-European presence===
Further expansion and diversification occurred between 1986 and 1989.

It began with the creation of a Spanish subsidiary, Air España S.A., based at Palma de Mallorca, in which ILG acquired a 25% stake, the maximum foreign entities or individuals could legally own in a Spanish airline at the time. This was followed by the acquisition of a 49% stake in German regional carrier Nürnberger Flugdienst (NFD), the purchase of a 33% stake in Norwegian charter carrier Norway Airlines and the creation of a new Italian carrier, Air Europe SpA, in which ILG held a 35% stake.

With the exception of Air España, which traded as Air Europa, all the other airlines traded as Air Europe. All of their aircraft – including those operated by Air Europa – adopted Air Europe&#x27;s livery. The only way to tell the aircraft apart, other than by their respective national registrations, was to look at the national flag following the Air Europe/Air Europa name on the upper, white part of the fuselage.

ILG eventually created Dutch-incorporated Airlines of Europe BV as a joint management and holding company for all of these airlines.

ILG &#x27;s move to seek a pan-European presence, including the Spanish market, the most important destination market for its charter operations from the UK, was not only driven by its desire to take advantage of new business opportunities resulting from the gradual liberalisation of Europe&#x27;s air transport market. Another important factor leading to this decision was to ensure the widest possible UK coverage for its package tour operations to enable Intasun to compete better with market leader Thomson. ILG wanted to be able to do this without incurring the additional expense of stationing aircraft and crews at regional UK airports to operate a small number of seasonal flights only or, alternatively, incurring the cost of operating empty legs with aircraft repositioned from its two main bases at Gatwick and Manchester.

This resulted in an arrangement whereby Air Europa&#x27;s aircraft were flying German and Scandinavian holidaymakers during daytime and Intasun&#x27;s regional customers at night. The resulting higher aircraft utilisation and lower direct operating costs for Air Europa compared with Thomson sister company Britannia Airways, the UK&#x27;s leading charter airline and Air Europe&#x27;s greater competitor in the European charter market, in turn enabled Intasun to undercut Thomson&#x27;s prices.

===Scheduled services===
Air Europe took its first tentative steps to become a scheduled-service airline in 1980, its second year of operation. However, the attempt failed.

Low-frequency scheduled services on selected leisure routes to destinations already served by Air Europe&#x27;s charter operation did eventually commence in 1985.

City-pair scheduled services plying the major international European trunk routes from Air Europe&#x27;s Gatwick base began in 1987.

As part of a major scheduled service expansion, Air Europe launched a new business class in 1988. This was accompanied by an increase in frequencies on most of its scheduled European trunk routes. It also introduced a new scheduled service aircraft type from late 1989.

At that time, work started on licence applications for several long-haul scheduled services.

====Abortive attempt to go long-haul====
Air Europe prepared to enter the scheduled service market as early as April 1980 when it applied to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for a licence to begin a year-round scheduled operation between London Gatwick and Miami, challenging Laker Airways&#x27; rival application to become the UK&#x27;s second designated flag carrier on the route in direct competition with Air Florida as well as in indirect competition with British Airways&#x27; and Pan Am&#x27;s services from Heathrow. The service was to commence at a frequency of five weekly return flights in summer and four weekly round-trips in winter. Air Europe proposed operating the service either with a McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 30 series widebodied trijet or a Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747-200B. Air Europe had already reserved delivery positions with both manufacturers. In support of its application, the airline stressed that any spare capacity would be filled with its tour operator affiliates&#x27; customers. It hoped that this would convince the CAA of the proposed operation&#x27;s viability on a year-round basis, especially during off-peak periods.

In the event, the CAA rejected Air Europe&#x27;s application. It argued that the airline was still in its infancy as this was only its second year of operation and, therefore, lacked the expertise to take on three competitors on a major, intercontinental long-haul scheduled service route.

====Launching low-frequency services on leisure routes====
Air Europe&#x27;s first successful scheduled route launch occurred on 2 May 1985. On that day the airline launched a four times weekly scheduled service between London Gatwick and Palma de Mallorca. This was followed by further scheduled route launches between Gatwick and Gibraltar as well as Manchester and Gibraltar in November 1985 and November 1986, respectively.

These route launches were part of Air Europe&#x27;s initial scheduled service strategy to operate low-frequency services on selected leisure routes to destinations already served by Air Europe&#x27;s charter operation.

====Taking on flag carriers====
The gradual liberalisation of the regulatory framework governing the airline industry in Europe from December 1987 provided the legal basis for Air Europe to become the first wholly private airline to take advantage of the new relaxed policies regarding the operation of fully fledged scheduled services on major European trunk routes in direct competition with the established flag carriers.

Air Europe considered itself well-placed to take advantage of the new scheduled service opportunities that became available to independent airlines as a result of the gradual liberalisation of the European air transport market. It enjoyed substantially lower operating costs than the established flag carriers because of its much higher aircraft utilisation and labour productivity. This meant that the airline could afford to undercut its rivals&#x27; business class fares by about 10–15% on each route where it competed with them.

This, in turn, provided the impetus for the formulation of a new scheduled service strategy, which was internally known as the &quot;New European Airline Project (NEAP)&quot;. The new strategy centred on Air Europe providing competitively priced and timed scheduled services on the eleven busiest international European trunk routes from its Gatwick base. The first batch of services was to be inaugurated with four brand-new Boeing 737-300s Air Europe had then on order, in a single-class, high-density configuration, at a frequency of two round-trips per day. All flights were to offer a full on-board service.

The early morning outbound service from Gatwick was to be the earliest flight of the day from any London airport to each of the destinations to be served. The late evening inbound service to Gatwick was to be the last flight of the day to any London airport. Air Europe hoped that offering the first flight out as well as the last flight back would strengthen its competitive position vis-à-vis its rivals by giving passengers a longer day, thereby helping them to cut down on overseas accommodation costs.

Other important reasons for choosing these departure and arrival times at Gatwick for Air Europe&#x27;s proposed network of short-haul, international European scheduled services were the availability of slots at an increasingly congested Gatwick and the in-built bias in travel agents&#x27; computer reservation systems.

The former meant that the only competitively timed slots that were then available at Gatwick due to the airport&#x27;s tight slot situation were early morning and late evening slots.

Operating the first flight of the day displayed that flight at the very top of a travel agent&#x27;s VDU screen. This automatically accorded it the highest priority among all the flights listed on the agent&#x27;s screen and, therefore, made it more likely to be booked in a typical travel agency&#x27;s high-pressured work environment.

Air Europe submitted its application to launch scheduled services from Gatwick to Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Zürich, Geneva, Rome, Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen to the CAA in November 1986. It requested the CAA to approve its application in time for a spring 1987 launch.

Eventually, services commenced in December 1987 to Munich, followed by Paris-Charles de Gaulle in February 1988 and Brussels in April 1988.

====Establishing a regional airline operation====

In June 1988 ILG took over Connectair, a small, Gatwick-based regional airline. Following that airline&#x27;s acquisition by ILG, Connectair was re-branded Air Europe Express and adopted a new corporate identity as of 1 February 1989.

ILG&#x27;s decision to purchase Connectair was part of Air Europe&#x27;s corporate strategy at the time to establish itself as a major short-haul scheduled operator at its Gatwick base. Gatwick had become very busy during the late 1980s. This meant that the much-coveted early-morning peak time slots, which Air Europe needed to be able to operate at times that were attractive to business travellers as well as competitive with its rivals&#x27; departure and arrival times, were in increasingly short supply. Connectair held a fairly large number of conveniently timed slots at Gatwick. ILG&#x27;s acquisition of Connectair therefore represented a golden opportunity to substantially increase the number of slots the group&#x27;s airlines controlled at Gatwick, thereby strengthening Air Europe&#x27;s competitive position at that airport.

Air Europe Express flew under the same AE airline designator as its bigger sister airline.

Its scheduled services initially linked Gatwick with Antwerp, Düsseldorf and Rotterdam.

Larger Shorts 360s gradually replaced the Shorts 330s.

In April 1989 ILG purchased Guernsey Airlines, another small, independent regional airline, which operated scheduled services between Guernsey and Gatwick as well as between Guernsey and Manchester at the time. On 29 October 1989 ILG fully integrated Guernsey Airlines into Air Europe Express.

These moves provided Air Europe with additional transfer traffic for its developing short-haul European scheduled route network. They also enabled Air Europe to launch new routes where there was insufficient traffic to support its larger Boeing 737 and Fokker 100 jet aircraft or where these aircraft were too big to provide a frequent schedule during the start-up phase, such as Gatwick—Düsseldorf for instance.

Following the replacement of the Air Europe Express Shorts 360 turboprops with Air Europe&#x27;s larger and faster Fokker 100 jets on the Gatwick—Düsseldorf route, Air Europe Express launched a new thrice-daily Gatwick—Birmingham schedule with its Shorts 360s.

During the year ending August 1990 the Air Europe Express operation carried more than a quarter of a million passengers across its route network for the first time.

Air Europe Express was forced to halt its operations on 8 March 1991, along with its sister airlines in the ILG-controlled Airlines of Europe group as a result of its parent company&#x27;s decision to put all the group&#x27;s companies into administrative receivership on that day, even though Air Europe Express itself had remained profitable throughout that period.

Following the receivership of ILG, the Air Europe Express operation was bought from the receivers by the original management of Connectair, who restarted operations as Euroworld Airways in May 1991. Euroworld was later renamed CityFlyer Express, which became
a franchisee of British Airways in June 1993 and was eventually acquired by British Airways in 1999.

====Introducing a new aircraft type to compete on frequency as well as price====
In early 1988 Air Europe began evaluating several aircraft types that had a lower seat capacity as well as lower direct operating costs per round-trip than the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737-300/400s to enable it to penetrate the high-yield business travel market more effectively with a tailor-made product. Operating a fleet of dedicated, lower capacity scheduled aircraft with lower trip costs in a lower density configuration at higher frequencies on the main short-haul European trunk routes from Gatwick had the potential to attract a far greater share of the highly profitable business travel market, thereby transforming the financial performance of the scheduled routes.

At the same time, Air Europe decided that it would also need to launch a separate business class cabin on all scheduled routes that had the potential to attract a large number of business travellers to penetrate this market segment effectively and to maximise its profit potential. This led to the launch of a new business class on 24 October 1988, culminating in the refurbishment of seven aircraft and the kitting out of 800 staff with new uniforms.

At the end of a detailed performance evaluation of an updated, re-engined, Rolls-Royce Tay-powered version of the original BAC One-Eleven 500 featuring a 1990s style glass cockpit, the BAe 146-300 and the Fokker F100, Air Europe decided to place an order for eleven RR Tay-powered F100s, including an option on a further eleven aircraft, in March 1988. Deliveries of the aircraft on firm order were to begin in late 1990. Air Europe primarily chose the F100 as its main scheduled aircraft to ply its business routes because it promised 25% lower trip costs than the 737-300/400. (It rejected both rival contenders because these had revealed serious range/payload shortcomings during the evaluation process.)

A subsequent change in KLM&#x27;s short-haul fleet requirements unexpectedly released four F100s from an order that airline had originally placed with Fokker. This enabled Air Europe to lease these aircraft, thereby bringing forward the date of the F100s introduction into its fleet by a year.

Air Europe&#x27;s inaugural commercial F100 service departed Gatwick for Brussels on 4 December 1989.

The F100s introduction enabled Air Europe to increase frequencies to a minimum of three daily round-trips on most of the routes the aircraft served. (Higher frequencies were eventually offered on the Gatwick—Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick—Brussels routes following British Airways&#x27; release of slots formerly held by British Caledonian, as part of a deal to permit it to take over its erstwhile competitor.)

The F100s introduction also enabled Air Europe to introduce &quot;mainline&quot; jet services between Gatwick and Jersey, following British Airways&#x27; withdrawal from what had always been one of British Caledonian&#x27;s few, genuinely profitable short-haul routes, as well as to replace the Air Europe Express service between Gatwick and Düsseldorf.

Furthermore, Air Europe&#x27;s F100-operated scheduled services showed excellent load factors and enabled each new route launched with that aircraft to become profitable within three months.

===Ordering a new long-haul fleet and other aircraft commitments===
Air Europe decided to become the launch customer for the Rolls-Royce Trent-powered version of the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 in late 1989 when it announced its intention to place a firm order for six aircraft and to take an option on a further twelve. The first of these aircraft was to be delivered in 1993.

The airline intended to use these aircraft to operate a mix of long-haul charter and scheduled services, thereby helping sister company Intasun to reduce its dependence on third party suppliers to provide it with long-haul capacity.

Work on licence applications to launch new, long-haul scheduled routes from London Gatwick to New York City, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand to be operated with the new MD-11s commenced during the autumn of 1989. However, these never reached the hearing stage.

In addition to the MD-11 order, Air Europe had outstanding orders for an additional 22 Boeing 757-200s, eight Boeing 737-400s as well as eleven Fokker F100s during that period.

In April 1990 Air Europe furthermore signed a MoU with Airbus for a firm order covering the delivery of 40 A320 200 series twin-engined, narrow-bodied aircraft for delivery between May 1995 and December 1998. (It also took options on another 40 aircraft, the deliveries of which would have stretched to November 2001 if confirmed.)

===ILG&#x27;s abortive attempts to take over British Caledonian Group===
ILG launched its first takeover bid, which valued British Caledonian Group at £36 million, in May 1986. (That bid materialised after several rounds of inconclusive talks exploring ways of combining the short-haul businesses of Air Europe and British Caledonian (BCal) in a new joint venture, which had taken place between ILG and British Caledonian Group since the end of 1985.) At the time BCal&#x27;s senior management dismissed ILG&#x27;s bid as &quot;derisory&quot; because it valued the entire British Caledonian Group&#x27;s assets far below their minimum expectations.

ILG decided to launch a new counter bid for the entire British Caledonian Group at the end of July 1987, following British Airways&#x27; outright rejection of ILG chairman Harry Goodman&#x27;s offer to purchase BCal&#x27;s short-haul operation for a fair price and to merge that operation with the short-haul operations of ILG subsidiary Air Europe, in return for not having the proposed BA-BCal deal referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).

Air Europe was concerned that a new entity combining BA and BCal had the power to destroy the UK&#x27;s remaining independent airlines, especially with regard to their ability to compete with such a behemoth. At the time Air Europe had ambitions of its own to become a major short-haul scheduled operator. It was planning to launch eleven new routes from Gatwick to Europe, thereby replacing and enhancing the services BCal had provided. Given a combined BA-BCal&#x27;s superior financial strength, considerably lower borrowing costs and far greater economies of scale, Air Europe&#x27;s management felt that it would be imprudent to launch these new routes if it had to compete with BA out of Heathrow and Gatwick as well. Therefore, its parent ILG had decided to make a counter bid, which it hoped would either kill off BA&#x27;s proposal to take over BCal lock, stock and barrel or result in it being referred to the MMC.

To enhance its credibility as a serious contender, Air Europe&#x27;s bid contained a detailed proposal to return BCal to profitability by way of a reorganisation. This proposal had been prepared by a retired BA head of route planning whom ILG had specifically hired for this purpose. The proposal itself entailed separating BCal into four discrete businesses, each of which would have had its own management who would have been accountable for the performance of their own business unit. The businesses into which BCal was to be split included a long-haul operation using the existing BCal brand, a short-haul operation to be merged into Air Europe&#x27;s existing short-haul operation using the BCal brand to serve business routes and the Air Europe brand to serve leisure markets as well as an engineering and a ground handling unit.

BCal&#x27;s senior management rejected ILG&#x27;s renewed bid on the grounds that it still did not adequately reflect the value of the group&#x27;s assets, in particular those of BCal. In addition, BCal&#x27;s senior management felt that both airlines&#x27; nature of operations and their business strategies were incompatible and that therefore there were no synergies to be gained from combining BCal with what they regarded as &quot;essentially a charter company&quot;.

===Air Europe&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to see off ailing Dan-Air===
The presence of Dan-Air, a major scheduled and charter operator at Gatwick and Manchester, Air Europe&#x27;s two largest bases, meant that Air Europe was facing a potential competitor for every additional scheduled service and charter contract that became available. Dan-Air&#x27;s large-scale presence at Gatwick, the airport&#x27;s increasing scarcity of early morning peak time slots, and the fact that Dan-Air had already been licensed to operate scheduled services to some of the destinations Air Europe wanted to serve as well while only a quarter of London&#x27;s and a third of the entire Southeast&#x27;s population lived in Gatwick&#x27;s catchment area also meant that attaining the &quot;critical mass&quot; to make its scheduled operation viable became an uphill struggle for Air Europe. This situation was made worse by the state of the British economy in the late 1980s, which was overheating and going to give way to a major recession during the early years of the following decade.

In addition, the CAA&#x27;s decision to re-allocate the licences for several of British Caledonian&#x27;s short-haul Gatwick feeder routes, which British Airways had agreed to return to the licensing process as a concession to have its takeover of that airline approved, to Air Europe, Air UK and Dan-Air weakened the overall performance of the airport&#x27;s scheduled services. As a result of this decision, Air Europe was excluded from the two main London—Scotland trunk routes and it was forced to compete head-on with Dan-Air to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Jersey.

Dan-Air&#x27;s growing financial problems at the time provided the impetus for ILG&#x27;s high-profile publicity campaign not to miss an opportunity to run down its ailing competitor in the press, accusing it of operating old, &quot;gas-guzzling&quot; aircraft. As part of this &#x27;anti-Dan-Air&#x27; campaign, ILG had already announced that Intasun was going to reduce the number of aircraft it chartered from Dan-Air from six to three for the 1989/90 winter season. ILG made a further announcement in this regard, stating that Intasun was no longer going to charter any Dan-Air aircraft for the 1990 summer season and that Air Europe was going to cancel its maintenance contract with Dan-Air Engineering.

However, ILG&#x27;s campaign to deal a fatal blow to Air Europe&#x27;s main rival suffered a major setback in October 1990 when Dan-Air&#x27;s beleaguered management appointed &quot;company doctor&quot; David James, who immediately set about refinancing Dan-Air&#x27;s parent organisation Davies and Newman Holdings in order to save the airline.

ILG&#x27;s commercial attack on Dan-Air ultimately failed when David James&#x27;s attempt to refinance Davies and Newman succeeded, with sufficient funds to allow Dan-Air to carry on its business for another two years.

===End===
At the end of the first week of March 1991 ILG and all of its UK-based subsidiaries entered administration resulting in 4,000 job losses. Many of the aircraft operated by Air Europe and Air Europe Express were impounded, leaving a large number of passengers stranded at airports. The Airlines of Europe conglomerate quickly unravelled, with Norway Airlines following its former UK-based parent into liquidation.

Hans Rudolf Wöhrl, NFD&#x27;s founder and original majority shareholder, bought back the stake he had sold to ILG from the administrators, thereby saving NFD. Air Europa survived the collapse and successfully established itself as one of the leading charter and scheduled operators in Spain. Air Europe Italy became one of the leading independent Spanish airlines following ILG&#x27;s failure. Most of the Spanish and Italian sister airlines&#x27; aircraft retained the UK carrier&#x27;s livery (paintwork) for a few years.

===Causes of collapse===
The main causes leading to the collapse of ILG and its UK-based subsidiaries, including Air Europe and Air Europe Express, were:

* A major, unforeseen downturn in traffic as a result of the recessionary economic conditions in the UK the looming Gulf War.
* Undercapitalisation.
* An unsound financial structure.
* Being financially overextended.
* Lack of ownership of any significant assets.
* A high-risk strategy.

Against the background of the looming war during the summer of 1990 and an abrupt recession in the UK, ILG began suffering heavy losses and mounting debts.

ILG/Air Europe&#x27;s senior management was aware that ILG had been facing a cash crunch from as early as 1989. This had made it more and more difficult for the group to finance the aircraft it already had on order, notably the F100s and the MD-11s. It was also clear to them that ILG did not have sufficient funds to run a fully fledged, rapidly growing scheduled operation in addition to a major charter operation.

ILG&#x27;s opaque financial structure and the fact that as a privately held company its ultimate owners, some of whom were residing abroad, were not subject to the same kind of strict financial disclosure requirements as the owners of publicly listed firms further exacerbated the group&#x27;s financial instability, thereby contributing to its collapse as well.

In addition to the group&#x27;s undercapitalisation and its overstretched finances, ILG generally and Air Europe in particular were not backed up by any significant assets.

For instance, Air Europe did not own any of the shiny, new aircraft in its fleet. (These were usually procured on highly favourable terms from the manufacturers and then sold upon delivery to ILG&#x27;s in-house leasing subsidiaries, such as AE Finance or AE Norsk, or to third party lessors, such as Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), from whom the airline subsequently leased them back. This enabled it to keep them off its balance sheet, thereby being relieved of the financial burden resulting from the aircraft&#x27;s depreciation, while keeping a substantial interest in the aircraft&#x27;s residual values, which were booked as profits. This sale-and-lease-back activity was a central plank of ILG&#x27;s corporate strategy. It also constituted a major part of ILG&#x27;s business and accounted for a large slice of its profits.)

Neither did the group hold the titles to the freehold of any of the properties that housed its offices and other facilities that formed an integral part of the business.

Air Europe&#x27;s massive expansion into high-profile scheduled services plying trunk routes between major European cities towards the end of the 1980s, the airline&#x27;s huge aircraft commitments lasting well into the 1990s, and ILG&#x27;s increasing reliance on profits arising from its interest in the US dollar-denominated residual values of the aircraft operated by its airline subsidiaries for the group&#x27;s overall profitability from 1989 represented a high-risk strategy for an undercapitalised company. This marked a major shift from the original focus on establishing Air Europe and Intasun as a major force in the UK charter airline/package tour market as well as Air Europe&#x27;s excursion into operating scheduled services on selected leisure routes only. Although ILG had justified this strategic shift by the new strategy&#x27;s far greater rewards compared with the old one, some members among its senior management suspected that there was an ulterior motive to all this. It was well known among senior company insiders that several sets of exploratory talks had taken place at various times, involving ILG and British Airways, as well as ILG and American Airlines. ILG had also held similar talks with a number of other interested parties. These talks had centred on how to intensify those parties&#x27; co-operation with ILG/Air Europe, including proposals for a full-scale merger/takeover.

This lack of being an asset-backed organisation with a high-risk strategy made lending money to ILG and its subsidiaries a far riskier proposition than lending to Davies and Newman Holdings, the parent company of Air Europe&#x27;s ailing rival Dan-Air. Not only did Davies and Newman/Dan-Air actually own many of the aircraft in the ailing airline&#x27;s fleet, which were mainly older, less efficient planes with a generally low re-sale value, but it also held the title to the freehold of a number of commercial properties, including prime real estate in the City of London. Moreover, Davies and Newman was the owner of Dan-Air Engineering, a sister company of the airline as well as the UK&#x27;s second-biggest and one of the world&#x27;s best-equipped aircraft engineering organisations at the time.

These were the main reasons ILG&#x27;s lenders, notably Lloyds Bank plc, which also had a substantial financial exposure to Davies and Newman, ultimately decided to pull the plug on the former rather than the latter, despite Air Europe being perceived as operationally far superior and financially stronger than Dan-Air by many of those who had no intimate knowledge of the true state of ILG&#x27;s finances. This included many well-reputed industry analysts as well as seasoned observers.

===Legacy===
Unlike many of its contemporary charter airline rivals, as exemplified by Dan-Air, one of its chief rivals, Air Europe had made a name for itself by becoming a pioneer in offering genuinely enjoyable as well as affordable jet travel for the average holidaymaker, which decisively broke with the charter airline industry&#x27;s &quot;cheap but cheerful&quot; image.

Air Europe was also typical of the trend which dominated the British holiday market in the 1980s, with tour companies operating their own in-house airlines, which, although accruing considerable capital expense in the first instance, enabled these companies to offer lower prices by effectively cutting out the &quot;middle man&quot;.

Intasun and its associated ILG-owned tour companies, Global and Lancaster, became what many consumers saw as the cheaper alternative to the other main British tour operator of the time, Thomson Holidays.

The existence of these two major brands helped open up the foreign holiday market. The fierce competition between them provided families with affordable and competitive packages.

Air Europe and Intasun were used as a template for many aspiring British tour operators, such as Cardiff-based Aspro Holidays, which launched its own in-house airline, Inter European Airways, in 1987, as well as Airtours (later rebranded as MyTravel), which merged with Aspro in 1993, to create the second largest tour operator in the UK and which was widely recognised as the direct successor to Intasun and Air Europe.

==Facts==
Many Air Europe aircraft had out of sequence registrations, especially in the early years. These aircraft&#x27;s registrations generally followed the initials of its executives, financial backers and/or promoters. The aircraft were also named after these people&#x27;s spouses or children.

Air Europe&#x27;s Boeing 737-200 Advanced had the following out of sequence registrations and names:
* G-BMHG – Harry Goodman, Intasun (later ILG) and Air Europe&#x27;s chairman. The aircraft was named &quot;Adam&quot; (after Errol Cossey&#x27;s son and following Air Europe&#x27;s first initial).
* G-BMOR – Martin O &#x27; Regan, Air Europe&#x27;s chief executive. The aircraft was named &quot;Eve&quot; (following Air Europe&#x27;s second initial).
* G-BMEC – Errol Cossey, Air Europe&#x27;s commercial director. The aircraft was named &quot;Joy&quot; (after Harry Goodman&#x27;s wife).
* G-BJFH – Sir James F. Hill, Executive Director. The aircraft was named &quot;Roma&quot;.
* G-BMSM – Stephen Matthews, ILG Finance Director. The aircraft was named &quot;Sandy&quot; (after Stephen Matthews&#x27; sister).
* G-BRJP – Roy J. Phillips, Air Europe&#x27;s chief engineer. The aircraft was named &quot;Louise&quot; (after Roy Phillips&#x27; wife).
* G-DDDV – Desmond de Verteuil, Air Europe&#x27;s first chief pilot. The aircraft was named &quot;Peggie&quot; (after Des de Verteuil&#x27;s wife).

Air Europe&#x27;s first two Boeing 757s had the following out of sequence registrations and names:
* G-BKRM – Renée Manchester, Air Europe&#x27;s first chief stewardess. The aircraft was named &quot;Fiona&quot; (after Errol Cossey&#x27;s daughter).
* G-BPGW – Peter G. Woodward, an Air Europe director and ILG Financial Director. The aircraft was named &quot;Anne Marie&quot; (after Peter Woodward&#x27;s wife).

Air Europe&#x27;s final batch of Boeing 757s, delivered from mid-1990, were also allocated out of sequence registrations, beginning with:
* G-BRJD – Rory J Downes, Air Europe&#x27;s then Chief Pilot (and ironically a 737 pilot)

Air Europe&#x27;s first British-registered F100 had the following out of sequence registration:
* G-FIOO.

Air Europe&#x27;s first MD-11 was allocated the following out of sequence registration:
* G-MDII.

Air Europe clocked up its first 1m miles on 26 July 1979, its load factor averaged 94% during the peak month of August and the 100,000th passenger boarded in September.

Air Europe made an operating profit after only nine weeks of trading.

Air Europe was allocated the two-letter AE airline identification designator in October 1980, allowing it to replace the initial KS designator.

Air Europe&#x27;s application to the CAA requesting permission to carry mail and newspapers on its regular charter services from London Gatwick to Gibraltar on days when there were no scheduled flights was approved on 7 November 1980.

Air Europe introduced a separate premium class cabin branded &quot;Premier Class&quot; on its charter flights between London Gatwick and Funchal in November 1983.

Air Europe became the first customer in a new American Airlines flight training centre near Gatwick Airport in 1983.

Air Europe won the prestigious &quot;Travel Trade Gazette&quot; &quot;Top Charter Airline of the Year&quot; award twice in two consecutive years, 1983 as well as 1984.

Air Europe achieved full Category III compliance in 1985.

Air Europe operated its own airside executive lounge at Gatwick&#x27;s South Terminal.

Air Europe staff working on the Boeing 747 leased from Tower Air during 1989–90 nicknamed the aircraft &quot;Fat Freddie&quot; after the last two letters of its US registration N602FF.

ILG was estimated to have gross liabilities of £460 million at the end of October 1990 and it lost £56 million in its last three months of trading.

==Accidents and incidents==

Air Europe had no fatal accidents involving an Air Europe aircraft. A widely reported flight deck fire involved an Air Europe aircraft in its penultimate season. On 17 December 1989, a F100 PH-ZCL en route from Copenhagen to Gatwick suffered a flight deck fire, necessitating a return to Kastrup Airport. None of the 88 occupants (seven crew and 81 passengers) were harmed by the fire that had started behind the co-pilot&#x27;s seat. The aircraft needed to be taken out of service and was sent for repairs elsewhere in the Netherlands. It re-entered service on 22 June 1990.

<text>The Ontarian River is the term used for the pre-glacial river that began the creation of the valley in Silurian age shales and limestones now occupied by Lake Ontario. The valley was greatly deepened by glacial action during the Ice age.

The original flow is thought to have been westward beginning from the Laurentian shield in the present area of the St. Lawrence River to eventually join the Mississippi River drainage system.

During continental glaciation, the tremendous weight of the glacier depressed the area of the St. Lawrence so much that a lower point of drainage was established eastward through the present river system. The area is still rebounding, however, and the rise could further rearrange drainage within geologic time by raising the outlet of Lake Ontario sufficient for it to drain at some other, lower point.

<text>Douglas Gordon Arthur Lowe (7 August 1902 – 30 March 1981) was a British double Olympic Games champion, winning gold medals in 1924 and 1928. On both occasions he set British 800-metres records of 1:52.4 and 1:51.8 respectively, the latter also being an Olympic record.

==Biography==
Born in Manchester, Douglas Lowe first attended Harrow but moved at the age of 14 to Highgate School, where unusually he was made Head Boy for two years before leaving in July 1921. An all-round school sportsman, he excelled as a middle distance runner, winning the Public Schools&#x27; 880 yd (805 m) title in 1920. Later, at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied medieval and modern languages, he played football and won the 880 yd (805 m) against Oxford in 1922 and 1923, and both the mile (1609 m) and the quarter-mile (402 m) race against them in 1924.

In the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Lowe won the 800 metres gold medal in a new European record time of 1:52.4. He beat the fellow Cambridge runner H. B. Stallard, who had been considered the pre-race favourite. Stallard suffered a leg injury and could only finish fourth. Lowe also came fourth in the 1,500 metres in a time of 3:57.0.

Lowe was defeated in a famous 880 yards race with Germany&#x27;s Otto Peltzer at the 1926 AAA Championships. Peltzer won by three yards in a time of 1:51.6 with Lowe (untimed but estimated at 1:52.0) also inside the world record of 1:52.2.

Lowe was a national 440 yards champion and national 880 yards champion after winning the AAA Championships title at both the 1927 AAA Championships and 1928 AAA Championships.

At the Amsterdam Olympics Lowe won the 800 metres in a personal best performance of 1:51.8, a full second and eight yards ahead of a world class field. He also anchored the British 4×400 metres relay team that finished 5th.

Lowe set a world record of 1:10.6 for 600 yards in 1926, a distance then recognized by the IAAF for record purposes. His other personal bests included: 440 yards – 48.8 (1927); 800 metres – 1:51.2 (1928); 1,500 metres – 3:57.0 (1924); 1 mile – 4:21.0 (1925).

Lowe retired from athletics at the end of the 1928 season but played 9 times for Isthmian League side Casuals FC in the 1928/29 season including in two friendlies against Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He also took up law at the Inner Temple in London, where he was elected a Bencher in 1955. First elected to the Bar Council in 1958, he was President from 1961 to 1964. He was appointed QC in 1964, and was made Recorder of Lincoln in the same year. He was a Governor of Highgate School from 1939 to 1975.

He was Chairman of the Universities Athletic Union from 1928 to 1936, Honorary Secretary of the Amateur Athletic Association from 1931 to 1938, a Council member of the British Olympic Association in 1928–38 and an IAAF representative in 1931–40.

Prior to the making of the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, Lowe&#x27;s support was sought, but declined. In consequence, the fictional character of Lindsay was created in his stead.

<text>The Megiddo Junction () is an intersection of Highways 65 and 66 in northern Israel, at the exit from the mountain pass coming up through Wadi Ara into the Jezreel Valley. 

It is named for the nearby ruins of the biblical city of Megiddo, also known as Armageddon, and the sites of several historic battles. Adjacent to the junction is the large (formerly a military prison), and less than to the northwest is kibbutz Megiddo.

The stretch of Highway 65 east towards Afula is called &quot;Kvish HaSargel&quot;, lit. &#x27;the Ruler Road&#x27;, since it is very flat and straight.

This is an important junction for the residents of the northern district of Israel, because it sits at the entrance to the Wadi Ara mountain pass which connects the North to the Trans-Israel Highway (Highway 6) and other highways in Israel&#x27;s coastal plain and, by that, to the rest of the country. Its importance slightly diminished when Highway 6 was completed all the way to the Ein Tut interchange near Ramot Menashe in 2009. The junction and Highway 66 can now be used as an alternate route for reaching Highway 6 via another mountain pass, Wadi Milek, located northwest of Wadi Ara.

On June 5, 2002, 17 people lost their lives and 43 people were injured in the Megiddo Junction bus bombing

<doc id="769118" wikidata="Q2572996" url="?curid=769118" title="Hiram Powers">
<text>Hiram Powers (July 29, 1805 – June 27, 1873) was an American neoclassical sculptor. He was one of the first 19th-century American artists to gain an international reputation, largely based on his famous marble sculpture &quot;The Greek Slave&quot;.

==Early life and studies==
Powers was born to a farmer on July 29, 1805 in Woodstock, Vermont. When he was 14 years old, his family moved to Ohio, about six miles from Cincinnati, where Powers attended school for about a year while staying with his father&#x27;s brother, a lawyer. He began working after the death of his parents, first superintending a reading-room in connection with the chief hotel of the town, then working as a clerk in a general store. At age 17, Powers became an assistant to Luman Watson, Cincinnati&#x27;s early wooden clockmaker, who owned a clock and organ factory. Using his skill in modeling figures, Powers mastered the construction of the instruments and became the first mechanic in the factory.

In 1826, he began to frequent the studio of Frederick Eckstein, and at once conceived a strong passion for the art of sculpture. His proficiency in modeling secured him the situation of general assistant and artist of the Western Museum, kept by a Louisiana naturalist of French extraction named Joseph Dorfeuille. Here he created representations of scenes in the poem Inferno by Dante, which met with extraordinary success. Fanny Trollope helped launch his career when she had him sculpt Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot;. After studying thoroughly the art of modeling and casting, he moved to Washington, D.C. at the end of 1834.

==Career as a sculptor==
Powers drew attention and local commissions in Washington, D.C. with his modeled portrait of Andrew Jackson. In 1837 he moved to Italy and settled on the Via Fornace in Florence, where he had access to good supplies of marble and to traditions of stone-cutting and bronze casting. He remained in Florence till his death, though he did travel to Britain during this time. During his time in Italy, he developed a friendship with Horatio Greenough. He developed a thriving business in portraiture and &quot;fancy&quot; parlor busts, but he also devoted his time to creating life-size, full-figure ideal subjects, many of which were also isolated as a bust. In 1839 his statue of &quot;Eve&quot; won the admiration of the leading European neoclassical sculptor, Bertel Thorvaldsen.

In 1843 Powers produced his most celebrated statue, &quot;The Greek Slave&quot;, which at once gave him a place among the leading sculptors of his time. It attracted more than 100,000 viewers when it toured America in 1847; and in 1851 was exhibited in Britain (along with the &quot;Fisher Boy&quot;, his other very famous statue, mentioned below) at the center of the Crystal Palace Exhibition, when Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a sonnet on it. This sculpture was used in the abolitionist cause and copies of it appeared in many Union-supporting state houses. Among the best known of his other idealising statues are &quot;The Fisher Boy&quot;, &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;, &quot;Eve Disconsolate&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Tribe&quot; (also called &quot;The Last of Her Tribe&quot;). He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851.

Powers&#x27; most discerning and important private client was Prince Anatole Demidoff, who owned marble full-figure versions of both the &quot;Greek Slave&quot; and the &quot;Fisher Boy&quot; and also commissioned from Powers a portrait bust of his wife, the niece of Napoleon and the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. The statues and busts Powers carved for Demidoff were exceptional in the quality and purity of the marble employed.

Powers became a teacher at the Florence Accademia. One of his sons was the sculptor Preston Powers.

Hiram Powers died on June 27, 1873, and is buried, as were three of his children, at the Cimitero Protestante di Porta a&#x27; Pinti, Florence (English Cemetery, Florence).

Spiritual descendants of Hiram Powers in Europe included the notorious Futurist designer &#x27;Thayaht,&#x27; pseudonym of Ernesto Michahelles and his brother, the notorious neo-metaphysical artist RAM, pseudonym of Ruggero Alfredo Michahelles who was awarded the &quot;Prix Paul Guillaume&quot; in Paris in 1937.

== Collections ==

In 2007 the Taft Museum of Art, Cincinnati, Ohio presented the first major exhibition devoted to his work, &quot;Hiram Powers: Genius in Marble&quot;. This is the same place of the first solo exhibition of Powers&#x27; work in Cincinnati in 1842, when Nicholas Longworth opened his private residence to allow the public to view Power&#x27;s newest sculpture.

<doc id="769122" wikidata="Q470590" url="?curid=769122" title="John Henry Poynting">
<text>John Henry Poynting FRS (9 September 185230 March 1914) was an English physicist. He was the first professor of physics at Mason Science College from 1880 to 1900, and then the successor institution, the University of Birmingham until his death.

==Early life and education==
Poynting was the youngest son of Thomas Elford Poynting, a Unitarian minister. He was born at the parsonage of the Monton Unitarian Chapel in Eccles, Lancashire, where his father served as minister from 1846 to 1878. In his boyhood, he was educated at the nearby school operated by his father. From 1867 to 1872, he attended Owens College, now the University of Manchester, where his physics teachers included Osborne Reynolds and Balfour Stewart. From 1872 to 1876 he was a student at the University of Cambridge, where he attained high honours in mathematics after taking grinds with Edward Routh.

==Career==
In the late 1870s, he worked in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under James Clerk Maxwell. In 1880, he became the first professor of physics at the University of Birmingham. He was the developer and eponym of the Poynting vector, which describes the direction and magnitude of electromagnetic energy flow and is used in the Poynting theorem, a statement about energy conservation for electric and magnetic fields. This work was first published in 1884. He performed a measurement of Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant by innovative means during 1893. In 1903 he was the first to realise that the Sun&#x27;s radiation can draw in small particles towards it: this was later named the Poynting–Robertson effect.

He discovered the torsion-extension coupling in finite strain elasticity. This is now known as the (positive) Poynting effect in torsion.

Poynting and the Nobel prizewinner J. J. Thomson co-authored a multi-volume undergraduate physics textbook, which was in print for about 50 years and was in widespread use during the first third of the 20th century. Poynting wrote most of it.

He was awarded an honorary MSc in Pure Science in 1901 by Birmingham University.

Poynting lived at 11 St Augustine&#x27;s Road, Edgbaston with his family and servants for some years. He previously lived at 66 Beaufort Road, Edgbaston (demolished) and died of a diabetic coma, aged 61, at 10 Ampton Road, Edgbaston in 1914. In 1880, he married Maria Adney Cropper. He was survived by his widow, a son, and two daughters.

==Legacy==
Alfred J. Lotka was among Poynting&#x27;s most famous students, being inspired by Poynting to apply the ideas of physical chemistry to biology. Lotka dedicated his classic book on mathematical population biology to Poynting.
Poynting predicted the &#x27;Poynting-Robertson effect&#x27;, whereby a particle of dust orbiting a star experiences a drag force which makes it spiral slowly into the star. Howard P. Robertson later restated the prediction using general relativity.
Poynting also founded and is the namesake of the popular student society at the University of Birmingham, &#x27;The Poynting Physical Society&#x27; or PPS.

Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour, as is the main physics building at the University of Birmingham and the departmental society there, the Poynting Physical Society.
He is credited with coining the expression &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in 1909 to explain how infrared-absorbing trace gasses such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the surface temperature of Earth and Mars.

<doc id="769128" wikidata="Q15756" url="?curid=769128" title="Dmitry Pozharsky">
<text>Dmitry Mikhaylovich Pozharsky (; 17 October 1577 – 30 April 1642) was a Russian prince known for his military leadership during the Polish–Russian War from 1611 to 1612. Pozharsky formed the Second Volunteer Army with Kuzma Minin in Nizhny Novgorod against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s occupation of Russia during the Time of Troubles, resulting in Polish withdrawal after Russian victory at the Battle of Moscow in 1612. Pozharsky received the unprecedented title of &quot;Saviour of the Fatherland&quot; from Mikhail I of Russia, becoming a folk hero in Russian culture and honored in the Monument to Minin and Pozharsky in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square.

==Early career==

Dmitry Mikhaylovich Pozharsky is considered to have been born on 1 November 1578 in Klin County, in the north of Moscow Governorate of the Tsardom of Russia. Pozharsky was descended from a branch of Rurik dynasty, sovereign princes which ruled the town of Starodub-on-the-Klyazma, near Suzdal northeast of Moscow. At one point in the 15th century the family estate burned to the ground, and in consequence assumed the name of Pozharsky, derived from the Russian word &quot;pozhar&quot; meaning conflagration. Pozharsky&#x27;s mother, Maria Feodorovna Pozharskaya, came from the Beklemishev family.

Pozharsky&#x27;s early career was not documented until the beginning of the Time of Troubles following the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598, when he took part in the Zemsky Sobor which elected Boris Godunov as the Tsar of Russia. Pozharsky&#x27;s closeness to the throne during Godunov&#x27;s rule made him an influential figure among Russia&#x27;s nobility. Pozharsky was attested as a stolnik four years later and supported the Tsardom in the Polish-Muscovite War following its outbreak in 1605. Pozharsky was present at the defense of Kolomna in 1608 and helped Vasily IV during the siege of Moscow in 1609. Later that year, Pozharsky routed the rebellious Cossacks of Ivan Bolotnikov at the Pekhorka River. In 1610, Pozharsky was in command at the defense of Zaraysk against the forces of False Dmitry II.

==Struggle for independence==
By this time, Russian popular indignation against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s occupation had gained momentum due to the abuses and criminal behavior of the Polish army, and the loss of support among the pro-Polish faction of Russia&#x27;s boyar class due to the actions of King Sigismund III. After Prokopy Lyapunov rallied the First Volunteer Army in Ryazan, Pozharsky promptly joined the cause and took a prominent part in the uprising in Moscow. Pozharsky was wounded on 19 March 1611 while defending his house at Lubyanka Square and was transported by his adherents to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius for convalescence.

In autumn 1611, when Pozharsky was recuperating at his Puretsky patrimony near Suzdal, he was approached by a delegation who offered him command of the Second Volunteer Army then gathered in Nizhny Novgorod to oust the Polish occupiers. Pozharsky agreed on condition that he would be assisted by Kuzma Minin, a representative of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod that was instrumental in the army&#x27;s founding. Although the volunteer corps aimed at clearing the Polish invaders out of Moscow, Pozharsky and his contingent marched towards Yaroslavl first. There they resided for half a year, vacillating until the opportunity for rapid action was gone. A man of devout disposition, Pozharsky fervently prayed before Our Lady of Kazan, one of the holiest Russian icons, prior to advancing towards Moscow. Yet even then he proceeded so slowly and timorously, performing religious ceremonies in Rostov and paying homage to ancestral graves in Suzdal, that it took him several months to reach the Trinity, whose authorities ineffectually sought to accelerate the progress of his forces.

===Battle of Moscow===

Finally, on 18 August 1612, the Volunteer Army encamped within five versts from Moscow, just in time when Hetman Chodkiewicz arrived with provisions to the relief of the Polish garrison barricaded within the Moscow Kremlin. The very next day, Pozharsky advanced to the Arbat Gate of the city and two days later he engaged with Chodkiewicz&#x27;s contingent in a four-day battle. The outcome was in no small part due to decisive actions of Pozharsky&#x27;s ally, Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy, who captured the provisions intended for the Poles quartered in the Kremlin. As a result, a famine broke out among the Poles and they had to surrender to Pozharsky and Trubetskoy in October, after being guaranteed safe passage and humane treatment. Nonetheless, most of the Poles were slaughtered upon exiting the Kremlin and few survived captivity. 

The soldiers of Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin observed the obligations but Dmitry Troubetskoy&#x27;s Cossacks attacked the prisoners and robbed them, killing many in the process.

===After the war===
Pozharsky and Trubetskoy presided over the Muscovite government for half a year, until a new tsar was elected by the Zemsky Sobor, whereupon Pozharsky was made a boyar and Trubetskoy was honoured even more highly. The Time of Troubles was now over, but minor risings couldn&#x27;t be subdued for an extended period of time. In 1615, Pozharsky operated against the Lisowczycy and three years later he fell upon the forces of Vladislaus IV, yet the conservative system of mestnichestvo precluded him from taking supreme command in any of these engagements. He governed Novgorod in 1628–30 and fortified Moscow against an expected attack of the Crimean Tatars in 1637. Pozharsky&#x27;s last taste of battle came during the ill-fated Smolensk campaign, when he was relegated to secondary roles.

As soon as peace had been restored, Pozharsky was given some enviable posts in the Muscovite administration. Among other positions, he managed the Prikaz (Order) of Transport in 1619, the Prikaz (Order) of Police in 1621–28 and the Prikaz (Order) of Moscow Judges in 1637–37 and 1640–42. He was summoned by the tsar to confer with the English ambassadors in 1617 and with the Polish ones in 1635. In recognition of his services, he was granted extensive estates around Moscow, where he commissioned several churches, interpreted in retrospect as monuments to his own victory against the Lithuanians and Poles during a dire crisis in the history of Russian statehood. One such tent-like church survives in his suburban estate of Medvedkovo. Another was the Kazan Cathedral in Moscow, adjoining Red Square from north-east, a direction whence Pozharsky&#x27;s army arrived to salvage the Muscovites in 1612.

==Legacy==

Pozharsky&#x27;s family became extinct in 1672, upon the death of his granddaughter, who was married to Prince , the most famous Russian commander of the time (&#x27;of the Dolgoruky family, not to be confused with the &quot;long handed&quot; Ryurikid prince of the Middle Ages&#x27;). Yet his memory would be cherished by the Romanov dynasty which to a great extent owned the crown due to his prowess and skill. When patriotic feelings were on the rise during the Napoleonic wars, a bronze Monument to Minin and Pozharsky was erected on Red Square. The day when Pozharsky and Minin entered the Moscow Kremlin as liberators was reestablished as a national holiday in 2005. During Euro 2012 group game between Russia and Poland, Russian fans unfurled a huge banner that read &#x27;This is Russia&#x27; with Pozharsky&#x27;s image.

Dmitry Pozharsky is a strong unifying figure for those professional historians who oppose Romanovs&#x27; version of Russian history for being extremely one-sided. Professor Andrei Fursov was also outspoken about the illegitimacy of Mikhail&#x27;s election: &quot;Because they gathered some random people who screamed &#x27;Mikhail&#x27;... The screamers supported him but there was no choice, there were armed Cossacks nearby! Here it is, a new tsar. Boyars could console themselves, firstly, by the fact they had remained intact; secondly, by the fact &quot;Misha Romanov is young, he has not reached his full mind yet and will be obedient to us&quot;; thirdly, the fact Pozharsky did not become tsar... That is why they did not like him [Pozharsky]. He was a Hero, and they, mostly, were traitors. Indeed, in 1610, the Moscow boyars were guided by selfish class interest, swore allegiance to Vladislav, and they were ready to “lie down” under his father Sigismund. It isn&#x27;t surprising the traitorous boyars had been sitting with Poles as their allies in Kremlin. When Kremlin was taken, Pozharsky has made a huge mistake. Instead of bringing the traitors to justice, he has declared them [liberated] prisoners of Poles.&quot;

<doc id="769144" wikidata="Q116718" url="?curid=769144" title="Manuel Prado Ugarteche">
<text>Manuel Carlos Prado y Ugarteche (21 April 1889 – 15 August 1967) was a Peruvian politician and banker who served twice as president of Peru. Son of former President Mariano Ignacio Prado, he was born in Lima and served as the nation&#x27;s 43rd (1939–1945) and 46th (1956–1962) president. His brother, Leoncio Prado Gutiérrez, was a military hero who died in 1883, six years before Manuel Prado was born.

Prado was born in April 1889 as the son of Mariano Ignacio Prado. He went to college and became a banker. In 1914, Prado, along with General Benavides, overthrew Guillermo Billinghurst and his government during the First World War, in which Peru remained neutral. Benavides became the president of the Junta. Later imprisoned, Prado was deported to Chile and went into exile in France. He returned in 1932, and upon his return he was chairman of the board of the Peruvian Vapores Company and general manager and president of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, which he served from 1934 to 1939. He ran and won the 1939 elections. Under his first administration, Peru came out victorious against Ecuador in the Ecuadorian-Peruvian War, and also became the first country in South America to break relations with the Axis, as Peru declared war on the Axis. After the end of his administration in 1945, he went to Paris, and eventually came back. He defeated Belaunde in the elections in 1956, as his second administration came to power. He sided with the United States in the Cold War, but was deposed in a coup, led by Ricardo Perez Godoy in 1962. He went into exile for one last time to Paris, where he died in 1967.

== Biography ==
===Birth and early years===
Born into a prominent political family, he was the youngest son of General Mariano Ignacio Prado and his wife, María Magdalena Ugarteche Gutiérrez de Cossío. His father was various times head of government of Peru and was President of the Republic when the war with Chile broke out in 1879. He left the country in the midst of the war and was later deposed by a coup d&#x27;état.

Prado had several siblings who distinguished themselves in politics, finances and diplomacy. His paternal half-brother Leoncio was a war hero who died executed by the Chileans in 1883. His eldest brother Mariano Ignacio was a prominent banker who founded the so-called &quot;Prado Empire&quot;, the main economic group in Peru during the first half of 20th Century. Other brothers included Javier, once Prime Minister and intellectual figure, and Jorge, also a Prime Minister.

Manuel studied at Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, in Paris, and Inmaculada School in Lima. He then attended the faculties of Sciences and Political Sciences of the University of San Marcos, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1907 and a doctor&#x27;s degree in 1910. He also studied at the National School of Engineers (now the National University of Engineering), graduating as a Civil Engineer in 1911.

Elected by both the student bodies of the National School of Engineers and University of San Marcos, he was a student delegate to the 1st Congress of American Students in Montevideo in 1908. As a undergraduate student, he received military education in the Military School of Chorrillos attaining the ranks of sergeant and cavalry ensign. He later joined the army whith this commission and was stationed in Lambayeque when a war with Ecuador was imminent in 1911.

Incorporated into San Marcos in 1912, he was assistant professor and then full professor of the infinitesimal Analysis course in the Faculty of Sciences.

=== Early political years ===

Joined to the Civil Party, he and his brothers Javier and Jorge supported the civil-military coup d&#x27;etat which overthrew President Guillermo Billinghurst in February 1914. The coup was organized by members of both the Civil Party and the Congress who wanted to anticipate the dissolution of the latter by Billinghurst. The Prado brothers took an active role in the capture of the Government Palace and once Billinghurst was arrested urged him to resign. The deposed Billinghurst later said that the Prado brothers stated that they were obliged &quot;to vindicate the name of his father&quot;. Manuel Prado was then promoted to lieutenant by the Congress. 

In 1915, he was elected member of the Council of the City of Lima. In the Council, he was an inspector of Works and as such designed some of the plans of the urban reordering of the city.

In 1919, Prado was elected a member of the National Assembly called by Augusto Leguía to promulgate a new Constitution. Early that year, Leguía had overthrew the Civilist President Pardo y Barreda and called an assembly to rewrite a Constitution convenient to him. Prado among other Civilists decisively opposed the new regime and despite being elected a senator later was deported by Leguía in 1921. He and his brothers settled down in Paris and London, respectively.

Prado returned to Peru after a military coup overtrew Leguía in 1930. In 1932, he was elected a member of the board of directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and, shortly afterwards, general manager of the Bank. In 1934, he was appointed chairman (Governor) of the Bank, a post he occupied until 1939 with the general manager office.

===1939 election===
For the 1939 general election, President Oscar R. Benavides chose Prado as his presidential candidate. Against this official candidacy, José Quesada Larrea, a young lawyer, a native of Trujillo, Peru, who for his campaign acquired the newspaper La Prensa, from where he fought for electoral freedom, for the obvious purpose of the government to manipulate the results.

The APRA party, which was the most important party in the country, was outlawed. Another important political force, the Sanchecerrista Revolutionary Union, was also annulled when its leader, Luis A. Flores, was banished. At the electoral juncture, both Prado and Quesada requested the support of the apristas(Members and supporters of the APRA) but they decided not to take sides. Prado ran as a candidate for a concentration of small parties.

Before the election, the government shut down La Prensa. When the counts were made, Prado appeared as the victor, with enormous advantage. There was talk of mass fraud

===First government (1939–1945)===

Manuel Prado assumed the presidency on 8 December 1939. Politician until then almost unknown, he predicted that he would not last long in office, but deployed a combination of tactical cunning, strategic flexibility and personal charm that made him one of Peru&#x27;s most effective politicians of the 20th century. His government largely continued the work done by General Benavides and was of relative democracy. It suffered the consequences of the Second World War, which had a strong impact on trade. Imports fell sharply but export products such as sugar, cotton, metals and rubber increased. The shortage of import products for domestic consumption brought about new industries that successfully replaced foreign products. The war made numerous &quot;new rich&quot; appear.

In the international order, Prado had two notable successes:

The first was the victorious war against Ecuador and the subscription of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol guaranteed by the United States, Brazil, Chile and Argentina,which sought to settle the old boundary lawsuit that for more than a century had kept the attention of the Peruvian chancellery. The problem was revived again some time later, following Ecuador&#x27;s withdrawal of recognition of the Protocol.

The second was the policy of continental solidarity and support for the United States and democracies faced by the Axis powers, Germany, Italy and Japan, during World War II. Peru was the first country in Latin America to break relations with the Axis powers, and during an extraordinary meeting of chancellors held in Rio de Janeiro in early 1942, it was the Peruvian attitude that inclined representatives of other American countries to support the United States. This pro-Americanism brought with it some excesses, such as allowing the United States to set up an air base in Talara, northern Peru, and the mass internment of German and Japanese residents.
In the domestic order, despite being considered a democratic government, Prado kept the Aprista Party outlawed; only in the last year of his government, on the occasion of the general election, did he legalize the participation of APRA, which on that occasion was part of the National Democratic Front under the name &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;. In contrast, many communists supported Prado, following the international context, as the Soviet Union belonged to the Allied bloc.

====Important events====
In addition to the victorious war against Ecuador, with the subsequent signing of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, as well as support for Western democracies in World War II, the following works were carried out in Prado&#x27;s first government:

*An &quot;import substitution&quot; policy was planned in the face of a shortage of imported products because of world war. In this sense, significant progress was made in the country&#x27;s industrialization process.
*The Peruvian Amazon Corporation was founded to boost the rubber industry,in the face of its demand for world war.
*The Peruvian Commercial Aviation Corporation(CORPAC),responsible for the proper functioning of airports, was created. For this purpose, Limatambo Airport was opened.
*The agreement with the United States for agricultural development was signed through the intervention of the Inter-American Cooperative 
*Food Production Service (SCIPA).
*The asphalt of the Peruvian stretch of the Pan American Highway was completed.
*The Central Road to Aguaytia and Pucallpa was completed, in themiddle of the jungle.
*The department of Tumbes (Law No. 9667 of 25 November 1942)and the department of Pasco (Law No. 10.030 of 27 November 1944) were created.
*The 1940 General Census was held, which yielded a population of 6,207,966. Some 577,000 inhabitants were concentrated in Lima.
*The organic Law on Public Education was given accompanied by an aggressive national literacy plan, in the face of the large number of illiterate people that the census unveiled (1943).
*It gave access to technical education, with the best implementation and equipment of art schools and crafts.
*The Worker&#x27;s Hospital (present-day Guillermo Almenara Hospital) was inaugurated.
*The Worker&#x27;s Hospital of Huacho (present-day Gustavo Lanatta Luján Hospital) was inaugurated.
*The Maternity Hospital of Lima was inaugurated.
*Mass vaccination campaigns began.
*The fourth Working Quarter was built on the Rimac.
*The Yavarí District was created in the Mariscal Ramón Castilla Province in the Department of Loreto
*The boost to tourism continued.
*Popular canteens were created, which subsisted efficiently for several decades.
*In this period there were two misfortunes of magnitude: the Lima and Callao Earthquake of 24 May 1940,and the fire of the National Library of Peru that occurred on 11 May 1943. The reconstruction of the latter was commissioned by the historian Jorge Basadre.

In the 1945 general election Prado sponsored the candidacy of General Eloy Ureta,the victor in the war against Ecuador in 1941. But the most popular candidacy was that of the jurist José Luis Bustamante y Rivero, representing a front or alliance of parties including the APRA: the National Democratic Front,which proved triumphant.

After his tenure, Prado traveled and settled in Paris where he owned a residence on the elegant Avenida Foch. In Lima, he was the owner of the Edificio Rímac from 1939 to 1945.

====Position on the Jewish Holocaust====
Faced with the systematic extermination of millions of Jews in Europe, Manuel Prado Ugarteche, through his Chancellor Alfredo Solf de Muro, implemented a strict policy of denying visas to Jews who asked for entry to Peru, even though they desperately sought to escape certain death.

Very notorious is the case of &quot;the negative response of the Prado government to the request of the &quot;World Jewish Congress&quot; so that Peru, like many countries in the world, would agree to admit Jewish children orphaned by war that were to be maintained and educated on 20 Jews residing in Peru. The Peruvian government, through Chancellor Solf de Muro, refused in 1944 the request to admit 200 Jewish children aged 4 to 10, who later were murdered at Auschwitz.

Another case that exemplifies his position is that of Peruvian diplomat José María Barreto, who worked for the Peruvian embassy in Switzerland during the Holocaust. Barreto was moved by Nazi brutality against the Jews, and decided to issue Peruvian passports to save 58 Jews, including 14 children. The Peruvian chancellery nullified the passports upon learning about this, closed the embassy in Geneva, and fired José María Barreto, ruining his political career.

During Prado&#x27;s second presidency (1956–1962), the only significant proscribed party was the APRA (American Popular Revolutionary Alliance), which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría. Prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected Congress a bill to legalize APRA once again. The bill was later passed and the APRA&#x27;s famed founder, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, returned from foreign exile.

====Foreign policy of first government====
In foreign policy, Prado – whose greatest pride was that as President in 1942 he made Peru the first of the South American nations to break off relations with the Axis Powers– was expected to side firmly with the U.S. There is documentary evidence that shows that Prado&#x27;s enthusiastic support of the deportation of Peruvians of Japanese descent to the United States during World War II was motivated by a desire to rid Peru of all of its Japanese-descended residents—a charge which some historians have argued amounted to a campaign of ethnic cleansing.

===Second government (1956–1962)===
Elections were held on 17 June 1956. The official results were as follows: Manuel Prado Ugarteche, 568,134 votes (45.5%); Fernando Belaunde Terry, 457,638 votes (36.7%) and Hernando de Lavalle, 222,323 votes (17.8%).

During Prado&#x27;s second presidency (1956–1962), the only significant proscribed party was the APRA (American Popular Revolutionary Alliance), which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría. Prado announced that he would submit to the newly elected Congress a bill to legalize APRA once again. The bill was later passed and the APRA&#x27;s famed founder, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, returned from foreign exile.

This government developed in a climate of turmoil motivated by the economic crisis that presented itself with increasingly alarming characteristics; because of the turmoil that arose in the countryside in favor of the realization of land reform and a vigorous campaign of national scope for the recovery of the oil fields of La Brea and Pariñas that illegally continued to operate the American company International Petroleum Company. The leadership of the opposition was assumed by the architect Belaunde, who organized a new mass party: People&#x27;s Action,which was preparing for the next general election, where he would have prominence. The newspapers El Comercio y La Prensa also made opposition, which could not counter La Crónica,a newspaper owned by the Prado family, because it was more oriented to sports and police issues. In the economic order, the biggest problem was budgetary in nature, which had as its origin the recession produced in the United States in 1957. Export products were significantly depreciated and dollars were scarce, so the Peruvian currency was devalued. Pedro G. Beltrán,the director of the newspaper La Prensa,then went on to support the government (1959) was appointed as Minister of Finance and President of the Council of Ministers. The mission was to put finance in order, balance the budget and stabilize the currency, which was achieved, not without first adopting anti-popular measures such as rising gasoline,cutting food subsidies and increasing the tax burden. It was a liberal policy.

In those years the migrations of the mountains developed a lot and the slums around Lima increased, to the point of talking about the &quot;belt of misery&quot; that was beginning to surround the capital. Overall, Prado did not do much to improve the situation and condition of the national majority that continued to live in terrible conditions.

As the end of government approached, popular discontent was undeniable. The strikes were slashed and boisterous and even violent protests were made in the streets. In addition to economic policy, the president&#x27;s own personality, pompous and frivolous in difficult times, was criticized.

On a personal level, Prado managed in 1958 to get the Catholic Church to annul his marriage to Enriqueta Garland so he could marry the Limeña lady Clorinda Málaga, which caused little scandal among the conservative sector of Limegna society. In 1961 he was the first foreign head of state to visit Japan after World War II.

====Important works and facts====
The main facts of this government include:

*The Industrial Promotion Act was given, which promoted the country&#x27;s still fledgling industrial development.
*The National Fund for Economic Development was created in each department for the execution of public works as a manifestation of administrative decentralization.
*A steel plant was installed in the port of Chimbote,with which the country intended to emulate the industrialization efforts of other Latin American nations. Chimbote was also already the most important fishing port and its explosive growth was one of the most jumping social phenomena of that time.
*He began taking off from the fishmeal industry,until he made Peru the first fishing power on the planet, a credit that was due to the talented Peruvian businessman Luis Banchero Rossi.
*Peru&#x27;s strong rights defense was made in the face of Ecuador&#x27;s campaign in America to ignore the Rio de Janeiro Protocol of 1942.
*Faced with the peasant demand for land reform, Prado limited himself to the creation of an Institute of Agrarian Reform and Colonization (IRAC), with the &quot;immediate purpose of studying, proposing and, where possible, implementing the necessary measures to increase the cultivated area by colonizing the forest, spreading small and medium-sized property and preferentially seeking the establishment of family farms&quot; , whose studies were resumed by the following governments.
*The new BAP cruisers Almirante Grau and BAP Coronel Bolognesi were acquired and came to replace the first cruisers of similar names that had been acquired 50 years ago, in the first government of José Pardo and Barreda. They would provide services until the early 1980s.
*The creation of the Joint Command of the Armed Forces,an institution that groups the commandos of the three defensive weapons of the Republic: Army, Navy and Aviation.
*The reform of secondary education being divided into Letters and Sciences from the fourth year. Technical secondary education was improved but primary education was neglected.
*Diplomatic relations with Cuba were broken after the triumph of the Communist Revolution and its orientation towards the Soviet bloc.
*Peru&#x27;s integration into the Alliance for Progress that then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy led to as a means of developing Latin America.
*An agreement was signed with Bolivia for the use of the waters of Lake Titicaca for irrigation works in areas surrounding and common to both countries.
*During the summer of 1958–59 the Puno Region was the scene of a disastrous drought that devastated the population. For this purpose, the &#x27;Southern Plan&#x27; was developed to revitalize this area.
*Television was established in Peru, armed by the Industrial Promotion Act (1958). Soon after, the first television stations emerged.

====Removal by coup d&#x27;état====

At the end of his government Prado called elections, with the main candidates being:

*Victor Raul Haya de la Torre, by the Aprista Party.
*The architect Fernando Belaunde Terry, for the Popular Action party.
*The general and former president Manuel A. Odría, for his national Odrist Union party.
The elections were held on 10 June 1962. At the end of the count no candidate had obtained the one-third of the votes as required by the Political Constitution at the time, necessitating that Congress choose among those who had obtained the most votes, which were the three mentioned above. The situation required a pact between at least two of these three main opponents. Unusually for some, the pact was made between the two staunch enemies, Hague and Odría, remembering that the latter would assume the presidency of the republic. But the government was accused of having committed fraud in some departments, so the Joint Command of the Armed Forces presided over by General Ricardo Pérez Godoy demanded that the government annul the elections.

The Peruvian Armed Forces had been opposed to the Prado administration as it made reformist measures focused on civilian life, which resulted with the military receiving less support from the traditional elites and the Catholic Church. On 18 July 1962, the guard of the Government Palace was absent and at 3:20 am, an armored division commanded by Colonel Gonzalo Briceño Zevallos stormed the palace and arrested the president and his companions, who foresaw a possible coup d&#x27;état. On the same day Prado was transported to Callao&#x27;s naval arsenal and embarked on the Callao BAP (anchored on San Lorenzo Island) where he was detained until the end of his term on 28 July. On 1 August he voluntarily left the country and settled in Paris.

A military governing board was formed that overturned the elections and convened new ones. It has been said that the real motive of this institutional coup of the Armed Forces was the anti-aprism still deeply rooted among the military, who did not want the APRA to rule, even in co-government.

===Later life===
Prado left Peru and settled again in Paris. He made a brief visit to his homeland as he commemorated the centenary of the Battle of Callao (2 May 1966), when he was paid a tribute for being the son of President Mariano Ignacio Prado, who drove to Peru during the last stage of the conflict with Spain in 1865–66. He died in the French capital the following year. He was buried in the Presbítero Maestro Cemetery, next to his father.

<text>Simon William Day (born 7 June 1962) is an English comedian and actor known for his roles in the sketch show &quot;The Fast Show&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Grass&quot;.

==Career==
Day was born in Blackheath, London, and rose to fame as a stand-up comic, winning the &quot;Time Out&quot; new act of the year in 1991 with his music hall character Tommy Cockles. He then appeared on the BBC One show &quot;Paramount City&quot; as a weekly guest. He continued working live all over England before joining up with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer for two tours and two series of &quot;Big Night Out&quot;. He continued to work with Vic Reeves throughout the 1990s.

In 1994, he was a cast regular in &quot;Saturday Zoo&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s Saturday night extravaganza, in which he appeared as groundbreaking white rapper Ice Pick. His other TV credits include &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot;, &quot;Love Soup&quot;, &quot;Driving School&quot;, and &quot;Skins&quot;. His film credits include &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, as a ferryman on the Thames.

In 2006, he collaborated with Ambient house band The Transit Kings on their song &quot;The Last Lighthouse Keeper&quot; which appears on their debut album &quot;Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God&quot;.

In 2008, Day embarked on his first solo UK stand-up tour, titled &#x27;What a Fool Believes&#x27;, which saw him play 36 dates during the period 30 October – 15 December, including Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

In 2009, Day collaborated again with Rhys Thomas and wrote and starred in a web series of six videos as the character Brian Pern for the BBC.

In 2010, Day appeared in the long-running BBC TV series &quot;Hustle&quot;, playing Luke Baincross, a wannabe playboy with a huge country mansion.

In May 2010, Day played a hospital porter in BBC TV series &quot;Holby City&quot; on his last day at work following his resignation having won the National Lottery. He had an altercation with a patient&#x27;s relative and received a bang on the head, and he became increasingly lairy during the episode, at one point making a pass at Connie Beauchamp; some people assumed he was drunk, but it transpired that he had developed a Subdural hematoma as a result of the knock on the head.

Day has appeared as a pundit on the long-running BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Pundit Quiz &quot;Fighting Talk&quot; on a number of occasions, and is most notable for swearing during a live broadcast during a show in 2009. This was later edited out on the podcast version of the show.

Day appeared in an online-only version of &quot;The Fast Show&quot; sponsored by Lager brand Fosters on 10 November 2011 along with original cast save for Mark Williams.

In 2012, he published his autobiography, &quot;Comedy and Error: They Really Were Marvellous Times&quot;.

Day has presented his own series, &quot;The Simon Day Show&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in May to June 2012.

From 2014 to 2017, he co-wrote and starred in the spoof-documentary series &quot;Brian Pern&quot;, a BBC Four comedy which parodied the life and career of former Genesis singer Peter Gabriel.

In 2015 Day appeared as Charlie Beckett in the BBC TV series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; episode 4.2. In 2019 he appeared as Sid Onslow, a pub landlord, in &quot;Pennyworth&quot;.

Day starred as Big Gary King, father of Tom Davis&#x27; titular character in the BBC One sitcom &quot;King Gary,&quot; appearing in the 2018 pilot episode and the full series broadcast in 2020.

Day reprised his &quot;Fast Show&quot; character &#x27;Dave Angel, Eco Warrior&#x27; in 2023 in energy usage advertising.

==Personal life==
Day was addicted to alcohol, drugs and gambling, and spent some time in borstal for theft during his teenage years. He continued to take illegal drugs including cocaine and crack cocaine into the 1990s at the height of his &quot;Fast Show&quot; fame.

After failing to pass his driving test for charity during the 2003 Comic Relief Programme, Day later went on to gain an automatic driving licence. He is married to Ruth, a former waitress, with whom he has two children, Lloyd and Evie.

<text>Ludwig Prandtl (4 February 1875 – 15 August 1953) was a German fluid dynamicist, physicist and aerospace scientist. He was a pioneer in the development of rigorous systematic mathematical analyses which he used for underlying the science of aerodynamics, which have come to form the basis of the applied science of aeronautical engineering. In the 1920s, he developed the mathematical basis for the fundamental principles of subsonic aerodynamics in particular; and in general up to and including transonic velocities. His studies identified the boundary layer, thin-airfoils, and lifting-line theories. The Prandtl number was named after him.

==Early years==
Prandtl was born in Freising, near Munich, on 4 February 1875. His mother suffered from a lengthy illness and, as a result, Ludwig spent more time with his father, a professor of engineering. His father also encouraged him to observe nature and think about his observations.

Prandtl entered the Technische Hochschule Munich in 1894 and graduated with a Ph.D. under guidance of Professor August Foeppl in six years. His thesis was &quot;On Tilting Phenomena, an Example of Unstable Elastic Equilibrium&quot; (1900),

After university, Prandtl went to work in the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg to improve a suction device for shavings removal in the manufacturing process. While working there, he discovered that the suction tube did not work because the lines of flow separated from the walls of the tube, so the expected pressure rise in the sharply-divergent tube never occurred. This phenomenon had been previously noted by Daniel Bernoulli in a similar hydraulic case. Prandtl recalled that this discovery led to the reasoning behind his boundary-layer approach to resistance in slightly-viscous fluids.

==Later years==
In 1901 Prandtl became a professor of fluid mechanics at the technical school in Hannover, later the Technical University Hannover and then the University of Hannover. It was here that he developed many of his most important theories. On August 8, 1904, he delivered a groundbreaking paper, &quot;Über Flüssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung&quot; (&quot;On the Motion of Fluids in Very Little Friction&quot;), at the Third International Mathematics Congress in Heidelberg. In this paper, he described the boundary layer and its importance for drag and streamlining. The paper also described flow separation as a result of the boundary layer, clearly explaining the concept of stall for the first time. Several of his students made attempts at closed-form solutions, but failed, and in the end the approximation contained in his original paper remains in widespread use.

The effect of the paper was so great that Prandtl would succeed Hans Lorenz as director of the Institute for Technical Physics at the University of Göttingen later in the year. In 1907, during his time at Göttingen, Prandtl was tasked with establishing a new facility for model studies of motorized airships called Motorluftschiffmodell-Versuchsanstalt (MVA), later the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in 1919. The facility was focused on wind tunnel measurements of airship models with the goal of shapes with minimal air resistance. During WWI, it was used as a large research establishment with many tasks including lift and drag on airfoils, aerodynamics of bombs, and cavitation on submarine propeller blades. In 1925, the university spun off his research arm to create the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research (now the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization).

Due to the complexity of Prandtl&#x27;s boundary layer ideas in his 1904 paper, the spread of the concept was initially slow. Many people failed to adopt the idea due to lack of understanding. There was a halt on new boundary layer discoveries until 1908 when two of his students at Gottingen, Blasius and Boltze, released their dissertations on the boundary layer. Blasius&#x27; dissertation explained what happened with the boundary layer when a flat plate comes in parallel contact with a uniform stream. Boltze&#x27;s research was similar to Blasius&#x27; but applied Prandtl&#x27;s theory to spherical shapes instead of flat objects. Prandtl expanded upon the ideas in his student&#x27;s dissertations to include a thermal boundary layer associated with heat transfer. 

There would be three more papers from Gottingen researchers regarding the boundary layer released by 1914. Due to similar reasons to Prandtl&#x27;s 1904 paper, these first 7 papers on the boundary layer would be slow to spread outside of Gottingen. Partially due to World War I, there would be a lack of papers published regarding the boundary layer until another of Prandtl&#x27;s students, Theodore Von Karman, published a paper in 1921 on the momentum integral equation across the boundary layer.

Following earlier leads by Frederick Lanchester from 1902–1907, Prandtl worked with Albert Betz and Max Munk on the problem of a useful mathematical tool for examining lift from &quot;real world&quot; wings. The results were published in 1918–1919, known as the Lanchester–Prandtl wing theory. He also made specific additions to study cambered airfoils, like those on World War I aircraft, and published a simplified thin-airfoil theory for these designs. This work led to the realization that on any wing of finite length, wing-tip effects became very important to the overall performance and characterization of the wing. Considerable work was included on the nature of induced drag and wingtip vortices, which had previously been ignored. Prandtl showed that an elliptical spanwise lift distribution the most efficient, giving the minimum induced drag for the given span. These tools enabled aircraft designers to make meaningful theoretical studies of their aircraft before they were built.

Prandtl later extended his theory to describe a bell-like lift distribution, reducing the loads near the tip of the wings by washing out the wing tips until negative downwash was obtained, which gave the minimum induced drag for any given wing structural weight. However, this new lift distribution drew less interest than the elliptical distribution and was initially ignored in most practical aircraft designs. This concept has been rediscovered by other researchers and has become increasingly important (see also the Prandtl-D experimental aircraft).

Prandtl and his student Theodor Meyer developed the first theories of supersonic shock waves and flow in 1908. The Prandtl–Meyer expansion fans allowed for the construction of supersonic wind tunnels. He had little time to work on the problem further until the 1920s, when he worked with Adolf Busemann and created a method for designing a supersonic nozzle in 1929. Today, all supersonic wind tunnels and rocket nozzles are designed using the same method. A full development of supersonics would have to wait for the work of Theodore von Kármán, a student of Prandtl at Göttingen.

Prandtl developed the concept of &quot;circulation&quot; which proved to be particularly important for the hydrodynamics of ship propellers. He did most of the experimental work at his lab in Göttingen from 1910-1918 with his assistant Albert Betz and student Max Munk. Most of his discoveries related to circulation would be kept secret from the western world until after World War I.

Prior to World War I, the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (GDNÄ) was the only opportunity for applied mathematicians, physicists, and engineers in German speaking countries to discuss. In 1920, they met in Bad Nauheim and came to the conclusion that there was a need for a new umbrella for applied sciences due to their experience during the war. In the same year, physicists primarily from industrial laboratories formed a new society called the German Physical Society (DGTP). In September 1921, the two societies held a meeting with the German Mathematical Society (DMV) in Jena. In its first volume, ZAMM (Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) stated that this meeting &quot;for the first time, applied mathematics and mechanics was coming to its own to a larger extent&quot; This journal advertised the common goals of Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Richard von Mises, and Hans Reissner.

On top of the foundation of ZAMM, the GAMM (International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) was also formed due to the joint efforts of Prandtl and his peers. After these initial meetings of GAMM, it became clear that there was now a new international community of mathematicians, &quot;scientific engineers&quot;, and physicists.

Other work examined the problem of compressibility at high subsonic speeds, known as the Prandtl–Glauert correction. This became very useful during World War II as aircraft began approaching supersonic speeds for the first time. He also worked on meteorology, plasticity and structural mechanics. He also made significant contributions to the field of tribology.

Following Prandtl&#x27;s investigation into instabilities from 1921-1929, he then moved to exploring developed turbulence. This was also being investigated by Kármán, resulting in a race to formulate a solution for the velocity profile in developed turbulence. Regarding the professional rivalry that started between the two, Kármán commented: “I came to realize that ever since I had come to Aachen my old professor and I were in a kind of world competition. The competition was gentlemanly, of course. But it was first-class rivalry nonetheless, a kind of Olympic games, between Prandtl and me, and beyond that between Göttingen and Aachen. The ‘playing field’ was the Congress of Applied Mechanics. Our ‘ball’ was the search for a universal law of turbulence.” Around 1930, the race ended in a draw as both men concluded that the inverse square of skin friction was related to the logarithmic value of the product of Reynold&#x27;s number and skin friction as seen below where k and C are constants.

Prandtl and von Kármán&#x27;s work on the boundary was influential and adopted by aerodynamic and hydrodynamic experts around the world after WWI. In May 1932, the International Conference on Hydromechanical Problems of Ship Propulsion was held in Hamburg. Günther Kempf showcased a number of experiments at the conference which confirmed many of the theoretical discoveries of von Kármán and Prandtl.

==Prandtl and the Third Reich==
After Hitler&#x27;s rise to power and the establishment of the Third Reich, Prandtl continued his role as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. During this period, the Nazi air ministry, led by Hermann Göring, often used Prandtl&#x27;s international reputation as a scientist to promote Germany&#x27;s scientific agenda. Prandtl appears to have happily served as an ambassador for the Nazi regime, writing in 1937 to a NACA representative &quot;I believe that Fascism in Italy and National Socialism in Germany represent very good beginnings of new thinking and economics.&quot; Prandtl&#x27;s support for the regime is apparent in his letters to G. I. Taylor and his wife in 1938 and 1939. Referring to Nazi Germany&#x27;s treatment of Jews, Prandtl wrote &quot;The struggle, which Germany unfortunately had to fight against the Jews, was necessary for its self-preservation.&quot; Prandtl also claimed that &quot;If there will be war, the guilt to have caused it by political measures is this time unequivocally on the side of England.&quot;

As a member of the German Physical Society (DPG), Prandtl assisted Carl Ramsauer in drafting the DPG Petition in 1941. The DPG Petition would be published in 1942 and argued that physics in Germany was falling behind that of the United States due to rejection of &quot;Jewish Physics&quot; (relativity and quantum theory) from German physicists. After publication of the DPG Petition, the belief of &quot;German Physics&quot; superiority deteriorated to allow for German students to study these new fields in school.

==Death and afterwards==

Prandtl worked at Göttingen until he died on 15 August 1953. His work in fluid dynamics is still used today in many areas of aerodynamics and chemical engineering. He is often referred to as the father of modern aerodynamics.

The crater Prandtl on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor.

The Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring is awarded by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt in his honor for outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering.

In 1992, Prandtl was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<text>Arabella Helen Weir (born 6 December 1957) is an American-born British comedian, actress and writer. She played roles in the comedy series &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, &quot;Posh Nosh&quot; and &quot;Two Doors Down&quot;, and has written several books, including &quot;Does My Bum Look Big in This?&quot; Weir has also written for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the latter&#x27;s &quot;Weekend&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Weir was born in 1957, in San Francisco, California, United States, to Scottish parents. She is the daughter of former British ambassador Sir Michael Weir and his wife, Alison ( Walker), who had met while studying at the University of Oxford; her father was from Dunfermline and her mother was from the Scottish Borders, daughter of the headmaster of a small boarding school.

Weir attended nursery school in Washington D.C., where her father was posted as a member of the British diplomatic corps. She later attended the Sacre Coeur Convent in Cairo, and the French Lycee in London. Having spent many holidays in Scotland as a child, Weir describes herself as &quot;culturally Scottish&quot;. After her parents&#x27; divorce she initially lived with her mother, her two older brothers and her younger sister in the UK. She has described her relationship with her mother as difficult, and in her comedy routine has exposed her mother&#x27;s &quot;cruel, snobby campaign to shame her into losing weight.&quot; Weir&#x27;s relationship with her mother later became the subject of her debut one-woman show, &quot;Does My Mum Loom Big in This?&quot; At the age of nine she moved to Bahrain with her father while her brothers were at prep school and her younger sister stayed with their mother.

Weir returned to London after passing the eleven-plus in Bahrain and her father was posted to New York. She was a pupil at the Camden School for Girls, where her mother was a teacher, and then studied drama at Middlesex Polytechnic. As a teenager, she was a backing singer in the British pub rock band Bazooka Joe, whose bass player was Stuart Goddard, who later became famous as Adam Ant.

==Career==
Weir&#x27;s television career breakthrough came in 1994 in BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fast Show&quot;; she later also became widely known for her roles in &quot;Posh Nosh&quot; and &quot;Two Doors Down&quot;. In addition to acting, Weir wrote several episodes of &quot;The Fast Show&quot; and &quot;Posh Nosh&quot;, and has also written for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 1998, Weir published the international bestseller &quot;Does My Bum Look Big in This?&quot;, the title of which was a catchphrase of her character &quot;Insecure Woman&quot; in &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. In 2000, she published her second novel &quot;Onwards and Upwards&quot;, followed by &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; in 2002.

In 2001, Weir took part in the &quot;Weakest Link&quot; Comedians Special. In 2006, Weir appeared as a contestant in the first series on Celebrity MasterChef. In 2007, Weir appeared in &quot;Skins&quot; as Michelle Richardson&#x27;s mother, Anna.

Weir played Chris Harper in &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End of London from November 2009 until the play closed in January 2010.

Weir voiced the female incarnation of the Doctor in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; Big Finish 2003 episode &quot;Exile&quot;. American alternative weekly &quot;Houston Press&quot;″s Jef Rouner described her portrayal as &quot;one of the most melancholy of all the Doctors.&quot; Weir appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2011 Christmas Special &quot;The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe&quot;.

Weir performed with the original cast from &quot;The Fast Show&quot; (with the exception of Mark Williams) in six online-only episodes sponsored by the Fosters brand.

From 2013 until 2016, she starred as Jenny in &quot;Drifters&quot;. In 2015, she joined the team of presenters for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Food and Drink&quot; programme. She also played a small role in Citizen Khan in the mid-2010s. She has also appeared with &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot;.

Since 2016 she has been starring in the BBC Scotland sitcom &quot;Two Doors Down&quot;. Weir&#x27;s performance was criticised by Ben Arnold, commenting in &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;her Scottish accent [is] still a work in progress, it would seem.&quot; When Weir was asked about this comment on Richard Herring&#x27;s &quot;RHLSTP&quot; comedy podcast, she said she was doing specifically a Paisley accent on the show and that both her parents were from Scotland, which she considers her home. Weir added that Scottish actor David Tennant had responded to &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; comment with the words &quot;What the f*** are they on about, it&#x27;s impeccable!&quot;, and that Ben Arnold (who himself is English) had later said to her he was sorry for making the comment.

In June 2019, Weir premiered her debut one-woman show, &quot;Does My Mum Loom Big in This?&quot;, a comedic analysis of Weir&#x27;s helter-skelter childhood and her difficult relationship with her late mother. The show&#x27;s title is a pun on Weir&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;Does My Bum Look Big in This?&quot; She took the show to the 2019 Edinburgh Festival.

In 2021, Weir narrated the pilot episode of the E4 survival reality competition format &quot;Naked, Alone and Racing to Get Home&quot;. Sean Pertwee replaced her for the full series.

Weir appeared in three episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Aggie and Ed Bailey&#x27;s old neighbour, Yvette, in June 2023.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Weir began a relationship with Jeremy Norton. They have two children, a daughter and a son. They parted in 2013.

Actor David Tennant is a close friend of Weir&#x27;s and is godfather to her younger child. They met while filming the six-part comedy drama &quot;Takin&#x27; Over the Asylum&quot; for BBC Scotland in 1994. Shortly after, Tennant moved to London and lodged with Weir at her house in Crouch End for five years.

She is a friend of Gordon Brown, and headlined a rally for his think tank, Our Scottish Future, in Edinburgh on 1 June 2023.

Weir was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to the Arts and to Young People.

<text>Edwin John Dove Pratt (February 4, 1882 – April 26, 1964), who published as E. J. Pratt, was a Canadian poet. Originally from Newfoundland, Pratt lived most of his life in Toronto, Ontario. A three-time winner of the country&#x27;s Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry, he has been called &quot;the foremost Canadian poet of the first half of the century.&quot;

==Early life==

EJ Pratt was born Edwin John Dove Pratt in Western Bay, Newfoundland, on February 4, 1882. He was brought up in a variety of Newfoundland communities as his father John Pratt was posted around the colony as a Methodist minister. John Pratt was originally a lead miner from Old Gang mines in Gunnerside - a village in North Yorkshire, England. In the 1850s he became a Methodist pastor and immigrated to Newfoundland and settled down with Fanny Knight, a daughter of Capt. William Chancey Knight. EJ Pratt and his seven siblings were under strict control of their father, who had high expectations of all of them. While John was strict and stern father, who had firm authority with which he ruled his family, Edwin and his siblings got a bit of a break when his father was gone on pastoral rounds, since their mother was very different in temperament from her husband. &quot;Fanny Pratt was easy-going and unpunctilious where John was careful and exacting, lenient and forbearing where he was strict and inflexible, soft hearted where he was hard-headed – she inevitably had a closer, more comradely relationship with the children. Raised in a less rigoristic household than he, she was prepared to take her children for what they were, make allowances for their fallen natures, and generally overlook their innocent iniquities&quot; E.J. Pratt&#x27;s brother, Calvert Pratt, became a Canadian Senator.

E.J. Pratt graduated from Newfoundland&#x27;s Methodist College in St. John&#x27;s in 1901. Like his father he became a candidate for the Methodist ministry, in 1904, and served a three-year probation before entering Victoria College of the University of Toronto. He studied psychology and theology, receiving his BA in 1911 and his Bachelor of Divinity in 1913.

Pratt married fellow Victoria College student Viola Whitney, herself a writer, in 1918, and they had one daughter, Claire Pratt, who also became a writer and poet.

Pratt was ordained as a minister, in 1913, and served as an Assistant Minister in Streetsville, Ontario, until 1920. Also in 1913, he joined the University of Toronto as a lecturer in psychology. As well, he continued to take classes, receiving his PhD in 1917.

Pratt was invited by Pelham Edgar in 1920 to switch to the University&#x27;s faculty of English, where he became a professor in 1930 and a Senior Professor in 1938. He taught English literature at Victoria College until his retirement in 1953. He served as Literary Adviser to the college literary journal, &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot;. &quot;As a professor, Pratt published a number of articles, reviews, and introductions (including those to four Shakespeare plays), and edited Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Under the greenwood tree&quot; (1937).&quot;

==Writing==

Pratt&#x27;s first published poem was &quot;A Poem on the May examinations,&quot; printed in &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot; in 1909 when he was a student. In 1917 he privately published a long poem, &quot;Rachel: A Sea Story of Newfoundland&quot;. He then spent two years working on a verse drama, &quot;Clay&quot;, which he ended by burning (except for one copy which Mrs. Pratt managed to save).

It was only in 1923 that Pratt&#x27;s first commercial poetry collection, Newfoundland Verse, was released. It contains &quot;A Fragment of a Story,&quot; the only piece of &quot;Clay&quot; that Pratt ever published, and the conclusion to &quot;Rachel.&quot; &quot;&quot;Newfoundland verse&quot; (1923), is frequently archaic in diction, and reflects a pietistic and sometimes preciously lyrical sensibility of late-Romantic derivation, characteristics that may account for Pratt&#x27;s reprinting less than half these poems in his &quot;Collected poems&quot; (1958). The most genuine feeling is expressed in humorous and sympathetic portraits of Newfoundland characters, and in the creation of an elegiac mood in poems concerning sea tragedies or Great War losses. The sea, which on the one hand provides ‘the bread of life’ and on the other represents ‘the waters of death’ (‘Newfoundland’), is a central element as setting, subject, and creator of mood.&quot;

With illustrations by Group of Seven member Frederick Varley, &quot;Newfoundland Verse&quot; proved to be Pratt&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough collection.&quot; He would publish 18 more books of poetry in his lifetime. &quot;Recognition came with the narrative poems The Witches’ Brew (1925), Titans (1926), and &quot;The Roosevelt and the Antinoe&quot; (1930), and though he published a substantial body of lyric verse, it is as a narrative poet that Pratt is remembered.&quot;

&quot;Pratt&#x27;s poetry frequently reflects his Newfoundland background, though specific references to it appear in relatively few poems, mostly in &quot;Newfoundland Verse&quot;,&quot; says &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;. &quot;But the sea and maritime life are central to many of his poems, both short (e.g., &quot;Erosion ,&quot; &quot;Sea-Gulls,&quot; &quot;Silences &quot;) and long, such as &quot;The Cachalot&quot; (1926), describing duels between a whale and its foes, a giant squid and a whaling ship and crew; The Roosevelt and the Antinoe (1930), recounting the heroic rescue of the crew of a sinking freighter in a winter hurricane; &quot;The Titanic &quot; (1935), an ironic retelling of a well-known marine tragedy; and &quot;Behind the Log&quot; (1947), the dramatic story of the North Atlantic convoys during World War II.&quot;

Another constant motif in Pratt&#x27;s writing was evolution. &quot;Pratt&#x27;s work is filled with images of primitive nature and evolutionary history,&quot; wrote literary critic Peter Buitenhuis. &quot;It seemed instinctive to him to write of molluscs, of cetacean and cephalopod, of Java and Piltdown Man. The evolutionary process early became and always remained the central metaphor of Pratt&#x27;s work.&quot; He added that evolution provided Pratt &quot;the solid framework within which he could achieve an epic style,&quot; and also &quot;gave him the themes for his best lyrics&quot; (such as his much-anthologized &quot;From Stone to Steel ,&quot; from 1932&#x27;s &quot;Many Moods&quot;.)

Pratt founded &quot;Canadian Poetry Magazine&quot; in 1935, and served as its first editor until 1943. He published 10 poems in the 1936 &quot;milestone selection of modernist verse,&quot; &quot;New Provinces&quot;, edited by F. R. Scott.
In 1937, with war on the horizon, Pratt wrote an anti-war poem, &quot;The Fable of the Goats&quot;, which became the title poem of his next volume. The Fable of the Goats and Other Poems, which included his classic free-verse poem &quot;Silences ,&quot; won him his first Governor General&#x27;s Award.

Pratt returned to Canadian history in 1940 to write Brébeuf and his Brethren, a blank-verse epic on the mission of Jean de Brébeuf and his seven fellow Jesuits, the North American Martyrs, to the Hurons in the 17th century; their founding of Sainte-Marie-among-the-Hurons; and their eventual martyrdom by the Iroquois. &quot;Pratt&#x27;s research-oriented methodology is made clear in the precise diction and detailed, documentary-style recounting of events and observation in this, his first attempt to write a national epic; but in his ethnocentrism Pratt presents the Jesuit priests as an enclave of civilization beleaguered by savages.&quot; Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye has said that &quot;Brébeuf&quot; expresses &quot;the central tragic theme of the Canadian imagination.&quot;

Expounding on that theme in 1943, in a review essay of A.J.M. Smith&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Book of Canadian Poetry&quot;, Frye stated that, in Canadian poetry:

:The unconscious horror of nature and the subconscious horrors of the mind thus coincide: this amalgamation is the basis of symbolism on which nearly all Pratt&#x27;s poetry is founded. The fumbling and clumsy monsters of his &quot;Pliocene Armageddon,&quot; who are simply incarnate wills to mutual destruction, are the same monsters that beget Nazism and inspire The Fable of the Goats; and in the fine &quot;Silences ,&quot; which Mr. Smith includes, civilized life is seen geologically as merely one clock-tick in eons of ferocity. The waste of life in the death of the Cachalot and the waste of courage and sanctity in the killing of the Jesuit missionaries are tragedies of a unique kind in modern poetry: like the tragedy of Job, they seem to move upward to a vision of a monstrous Leviathan, a power of chaotic nihilism which is &quot;king over all the children of pride.&quot;

By the time &quot;Brébeuf&quot; was published the war had begun; and &quot;in his next four volumes, Pratt returned to themes of patriotism and violence. Sea poetry merges with war poetry in Dunkirk (1941), which recounts the epic rescue of British forces while also emphasizing its democratic nature... Language plays a pivotal role as Churchill&#x27;s call inspires the miraculous deliverance. The title poem in Still Life and Other Verse (1943) satirizes poets who ignore the destruction, the still life, all about them in wartime... Other poems include &#x27;The Radio in the Ivory Tower,&#x27; which shows isolation from world events to be impossible... &#x27;The Submarine,&#x27; which highlights the atavism of modern warfare by treating the submarine as a shark; and &#x27;Come Away, Death,&#x27; which personifies death to show its new horrors in modern times.&quot;

&quot;Still Life and Other Verse&quot; included another poem, &quot;The Truant ,&quot; which Frye later called &quot;the greatest poem in Canadian literature.&quot; In &quot;The Truant,&quot; a &quot;somewhat comic deity, who speaks in evolutionary terms and metaphors, has man hauled before him to be punished for messing up the grand evolving scheme of things. Cheeky &quot;genus homo&quot;, instead of being duly cowed by the Great Panjandrum, points out that He is largely man&#x27;s invention in any case.&quot; Says Buitenhuis: &quot;The poem is too simplistic to be convincing, but is essential reading for anyone who seeks to understand Pratt&#x27;s thought.&quot;

Pratt&#x27;s next book, &quot;They are Returning (1945) celebrates the anticipated end of the war, but also introduces one of the first treatments in literature of the concentration camps. And retrospectively, Behind the Log (1947) commemorates the wartime role of the Royal Canadian Navy and the merchant marine.&quot;

By 1952, Frye was calling Pratt one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s two leading poets&quot; (the other being Earle Birney). In that year Pratt published Towards the Last Spike, his final epic, on the building of Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railroad, the Canadian Pacific Railway. &quot;Presenting an anglo/central-Canadian perspective, the poem interweaves the political battles between Sir John A. Macdonald and Edward Blake with the labourers&#x27; physical battles against mountains, mud, and the Laurentian Shield. In a metaphorical method typical of his style, Pratt characterizes the Shield as a prehistoric lizard rudely aroused from its sleep by the railroad builders&#x27; dynamite.&quot;

Pratt&#x27;s reputation as a major poet rests on his longer narrative poems, &quot;many of which show him as a mythologizer of the Canadian male experience; but a number of shorter philosophical works also command recognition. ‘From stone to steel ’ asserts the necessity for redemptive suffering arising from the failure of humanity&#x27;s spiritual evolution to keep pace without physical evolution and cultural achievements; ‘Come away, death’ is a complexly allusive account of the way the once-articulate and ceremonial human response to death was rendered inarticulate by the primitive violence of a sophisticated bomb; and ‘The truant ’ dramatically presents a confrontation in a thoroughly patriarchal cosmos between the fiercely independent ‘little genus homo’ and a totalitarian mechanistic power, ‘the great Panjandrum’. Pratt&#x27;s choices of forms and metrics were conservative for his time; but his diction was experimental, reflecting in its specificity and its frequent technicality both his belief in the poetic power of the accurate and concrete that led him into assiduous research processes, and his view that one of the poet&#x27;s tasks is to bridge the gap between the two branches of human pursuit: the scientific and artistic.&quot;

&quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; adds of Pratt: &quot;A major poet, he is, nevertheless, an isolated figure, belonging to no school or movement and directly influencing few other poets of his time.&quot;

==Recognition==

Pratt won Canada&#x27;s top poetry prize, the Governor General&#x27;s Award, three times: in 1937 for &quot;The Fable of the Goats and other Poems&quot;; in 1940 for &quot;Brébeuf and his Brethren&quot;; and in 1952, for &quot;Towards the Last Spike&quot;.

He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1930, and was awarded the Society&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal in 1940. In 1946, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George by King George VI.

He was awarded a Canada Council Medal for distinction in literature in 1961.

He was designated a Person of National Historic Significance in 1975.

The University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria University library currently bears his name, as do the University&#x27;s E.J. Pratt Medal and Prize for poetry. Winners of the award include Margaret Atwood in 1961 and Michael Ondaatje in 1966.

The E. J. Pratt Chair in Canadian Literature was created in his name by the University of Toronto in 2003. The chair has been held since its founding by George Elliot Clarke.

The E.J. Pratt commemorative stamp was released in 1983.

<text>William Veazie Pratt (28 February 1869 – 25 November 1957) was an admiral in the United States Navy. He served as the President of the Naval War College from 1925 to 1927, and as the 5th Chief of Naval Operations from 1930 to 1933.

==Early life==
William V. Pratt was born in Belfast, Maine. He was the son of Nichols Pratt, who served in the Union Navy during the American Civil War with the rank of acting master.

==Naval career==

After graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1889, Pratt served in several cruisers and gunboats, visiting Europe, South America and Asia. During 1895–97, Ensign Pratt had the first of three instructor tours at the Naval Academy. He was assigned to the gunboat during the Spanish–American War and to the cruiser afterwards. While in the latter, he returned to Asiatic waters, where he saw action in the Philippine–American War. A second Naval Academy session followed in 1900–1902, after which he served in the North Atlantic Fleet flagship .

Lieutenant Commander Pratt&#x27;s final Naval Academy tour took place in 1905–1908. He then was executive officer of the cruisers and . Promoted to the rank of commander in 1910, Pratt was an instructor at the Naval War College in 1911–1913 and spent the next two years in the Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla, much of that as commanding officer of its flagship, the scout cruiser . Captain Pratt was assigned to the United States Army in Panama and at the Army War College in 1915–1917. During World War I he served in Washington, D.C. as Assistant Chief of Naval Operations in 1918.

Pratt was at sea in 1919–1921 as commanding officer of the battleship and as Commander Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. Following promotion to rear admiral in mid-1921, he was a member of the General Board in Washington, D.C., and served as a technical advisor during the negotiations that led to the Washington Naval Limitations Treaty of February 1922. He commanded a battleship division in 1923–1925 and was president of the court of inquiry that examined the 8 September 1923 Honda Point Disaster. Assignments followed to the General Board and as president of the Naval War College. In 1927, he returned to sea as Commander Battleship Divisions, Battle Fleet. A year later, he became Commander Battle Fleet in the rank of admiral and in 1929–1930 was commander in chief of United States Fleet.

Pratt&#x27;s work with the U.S. Fleet was interrupted in early 1930 by a trip to England to participate in the London conference that further limited the size of the world&#x27;s major navies. He became Chief of Naval Operations in September 1930 and spent nearly three years in that post, during a time when Depression-era demands for economy made it very difficult to maintain the Navy&#x27;s size and readiness. During his tenure, he also helped Coast Guard Commandant Harry G. Hamlet in discouraging President Franklin D. Roosevelt from merging the Navy and Coast Guard. Pratt agreed with President Herbert Hoovers&#x27;s emphasis on disarmament and went along with postponement of new construction and cutting the fleet. Other naval officers disagreed sharply with Hoover&#x27;s policies.

==Later life==

Retired at the beginning of July 1933, Pratt lived thereafter in Maine and New York City. During World War II, he wrote a regular column for a nationally circulated magazine and spent several months on active Navy Department duty in 1941 studying measures to counter the German submarine threat. Pratt died in 1957.

Like his father, Pratt was a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Legacy==
In 1960, the destroyer USS &quot;William V. Pratt&quot; (DLG-13, later DDG-44) was named in honor of Admiral Pratt.

<text>In mathematics, an astroid is a particular type of roulette curve: a hypocycloid with four cusps. Specifically, it is the locus of a point on a circle as it rolls inside a fixed circle with four times the radius. By double generation, it is also the locus of a point on a circle as it rolls inside a fixed circle with 4/3 times the radius. It can also be defined as the envelope of a line segment of fixed length that moves while keeping an end point on each of the axes. It is therefore the envelope of the moving bar in the Trammel of Archimedes.

Its modern name comes from the Greek word for &quot;star&quot;. It was proposed, originally in the form of &quot;Astrois&quot;, by Joseph Johann von Littrow in 1838. The curve had a variety of names, including tetracuspid (still used), cubocycloid, and paracycle. It is nearly identical in form to the evolute of an ellipse.

==Equations==
If the radius of the fixed circle is &quot;a&quot; then the equation is given by
formula_1
This implies that an astroid is also a superellipse.

Parametric equations are
formula_2

The pedal equation with respect to the origin is 
formula_3

the Whewell equation is 
formula_4
and the Cesàro equation is
formula_5

The polar equation is
formula_6

The astroid is a real locus of a plane algebraic curve of genus zero. It has the equation
formula_7

The astroid is, therefore, a real algebraic curve of degree six.

==Derivation of the polynomial equation==
The polynomial equation may be derived from Leibniz&#x27;s equation by elementary algebra:
formula_1

Cube both sides:
formula_9

Cube both sides again:
formula_10

But since:
formula_11

It follows that
formula_12

Therefore:
formula_13
or
formula_14

==Metric properties==
;Area enclosed :formula_15
;Length of curve :formula_16
;Volume of the surface of revolution of the enclose area about the &quot;x&quot;-axis. :formula_17
;Area of surface of revolution about the &quot;x&quot;-axis :formula_18

==Properties==
The astroid has four cusp singularities in the real plane, the points on the star. It has two more complex cusp singularities at infinity, and four complex double points, for a total of ten singularities.

The dual curve to the astroid is the cruciform curve with equation formula_19
The evolute of an astroid is an astroid twice as large.

The astroid has only one tangent line in each oriented direction, making it an example of a hedgehog.

<text>Raúl Prebisch (April 17, 1901April 29, 1986) was an Argentine economist known for his contributions to structuralist economics such as the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis, which formed the basis of economic dependency theory. He became the executive director of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA or CEPAL) in 1950. In 1950, he also released the very influential study &quot;The Economic Development of Latin America and its Principal Problems&quot;.

==Early years==
He was born in Tucumán, Argentina, to German settlers and studied at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Economic Sciences, where he later taught. His brother Alberto Prebisch became a well-known architect. As a young man his writing was marked by a complete adherence to the idea of free-trade but in the 1930s, as a result of the Great Depression he &quot;converted&quot; to protectionism. His previous beliefs had been supported by the spectacular economic growth of Argentina from the 1860s to 1920s as the country exported a large amount of beef and wheat to the United Kingdom. However, by the 1930s the Great Depression and the growing economic dominance of the United States, which exported beef and wheat rather than buying them, had significantly hurt the Argentinian economy.

==Centre and periphery==
The plight of Argentina forced Prebisch to reexamine the principle of comparative advantage described by David Ricardo, marking the creation of a new school of economic thought in the late 1940s. Prebisch separated out the purely theoretical aspects of economics from the actual practice of trade and the power structures that underlie trading institutions and agreements. His resulting division of the world into the economic &quot;centre&quot;, consisting of industrialised nations such as the U.S., and the &quot;periphery&quot;, consisting of primary producers, remains used to this day. As president of the Central Bank of Argentina he had noticed that during the Great Depression the prices of primary products, such as agricultural goods, fell much more than the prices of manufactured secondary products. However, he and his colleagues were unable to specify the exact mechanism for the difference, beyond hypothesizing that supply conditions of primary and secondary goods were different in that while farmers planted the same amount every year regardless of the price they would get, manufacturers were able to reduce or increase capacity to respond to expected changes in demand.

However, these ideas remained unformed until he was appointed executive director of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA or CEPAL) in 1950. In 1950, he released a study &quot;The Economic Development of Latin America and its Principal Problems&quot; that stated what is now known as the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis. German economist Hans Singer had separately arrived at a similar conclusion as Prebisch at roughly the same time, although his paper used a more empirical approach based on analysis of world trade statistics. The hypothesis begins with the observation that in the present world system the periphery produces primary goods to export to the center, and the centre produces secondary goods for export to the periphery. According to the hypothesis, as technology improves, the centre is able to retain the savings made, since it can retain higher wages and profits through developed unions and commercial institutions. At the periphery, companies and workers are weaker, and have to pass on technical savings to their customers in the form of lower prices. Prebisch pointed to the decline in the terms of trade between industrialised and non-industrialised countries, which meant peripheral nations had to export more to get the same value of industrial imports. Through this system, all of the benefits of technology and international trade would accrue to the centre.

Due to Prebisch&#x27;s influence the ECLA became the center of Third World activism in the UN, giving birth to the Latin American school of structuralist economics. While many scholars perceive Prebisch as supporting import substitution industrialization (ISI), in which a nation progressively changes its imports and internal production, focusing on industrialization, at the cost of imported &quot;superfluous&quot; goods in favor of capital and intermediate goods for a given period of time, Prebisch criticized protectionism, especially that practiced by Juan Perón in Argentina, since 1956 and ISI since at least 1963. He advocated industrialization and economic cooperation, including through trade, among developing countries.
The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to Raúl Prebisch in 1977.

==UNCTAD secretary-general==
Between 1964 and 1969, he served as the founding secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Selected for his unparalleled reputation, he tried to forge UNCTAD into a body advocating the case of the whole developing world. His approach to development took a more trade-focused approach, advocating preferential access to the markets of developed countries and regional integration, building up trade between peripheral countries. Increasingly he stressed the extent to which developing countries had to bring growth by internal reforms rather than through external help. He publicly condemned ISI as having failed to bring proper development. Prebisch found his years at UNCTAD frustrating and &quot;sterile&quot; as it became increasingly bureaucratic and failed to achieve its main objectives. His sudden resignation in 1969 signified his loss of patience with the organisation&#x27;s failures.

==Dependency theory==
During the 1960s, economists at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA) developed an extension of Prebisch&#x27;s thoughts on structuralism into dependency theory, in which economic development of the periphery is seen as a nearly impossible task. While dependency theory was the polar opposite of Prebisch and ECLA&#x27;s original purpose, he continued to criticize the neo-classical economic forces that he felt were victimizing the global poor.

==Legacy==
Prior to the takeover of Chile by the Augusto Pinochet regime, economic thought in the country, particularly the University of Chile, was dominated by his ideas.

<doc id="769166" wikidata="Q553223" url="?curid=769166" title="Esomeprazole">
<text>Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium [or Neksium] among others, is a medication which reduces stomach acid. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Its effectiveness is similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.
Common side effects include headache, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. Serious side effects may include angioedema, Clostridioides difficile infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe, while safety during breastfeeding is unclear. Esomeprazole is the (&quot;S&quot;)-(−)-enantiomer (or less specifically the S-isomer) of omeprazole. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach.
It was patented in 1993 and approved for medical use in 2000. It is available as a generic medication and sold over the counter in several countries. In 2022, it was the 122nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. It is also available in lower dose formulations without a prescription in the United States, the United Kingdom as well as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

==Medical use==
The primary uses of esomeprazole are gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot;, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease.

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as heartburn. Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus and is associated with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus reducing their effect on the esophagus.

===Duodenal ulcers===
Esomeprazole is combined with the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. Infection by &quot;H. pylori&quot; is a causative factor in the majority of peptic and duodenal ulcers.

===Efficacy===
A 2006 meta analysis concluded that compared to other proton pump inhibitors, esomeprazole confers a modest overall benefit in esophageal healing and symptom relief. When broken down by disease severity, the benefit of esomeprazole relative to other proton pump inhibitors was negligible in people with mild disease (number needed to treat 50), but appeared more in those with severe disease (number needed to treat 8). A second meta analysis also found increases in erosive esophageal healing (&gt;95% healing rate) when compared to standardized doses in broadly selected patient populations. A 2017 study found esomeprazole to be among a number of effective PPIs.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing of the eyes or skin.

Proton pump inhibitors may be associated with a greater risk of hip fractures and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhoea. Patients are frequently administered the drugs in intensive care as a protective measure against ulcers, but this use is also associated with a 30% increase in occurrence of pneumonia.

Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors in patients treated for &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of gastric cancer.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is a possible adverse reaction when using proton pump inhibitors.

== Interactions ==
Esomeprazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C19, and may therefore interact with drugs that depend on it for metabolism, such as diazepam and warfarin; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole. Conversely, clopidogrel (Plavix) is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of clopidogrel, thus reducing its effects.

Drugs that depend on stomach pH for absorption may interact with esomeprazole; drugs that depend on an acidic environment (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as erythromycin) will be absorbed to a greater extent than normal.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Single 20 to 40mg oral doses generally give rise to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0mg/L within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels on the order of 1–3mg/L. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed.

== Dosage forms ==
Esomeprazole is available as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed-release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada (containing esomeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 20 and 40mg, as delayed-release capsules in the United States (containing esomeprazole strontium) in a 49.3mg strength (delivering the equivalent of 40mg of esomeprazole, and as esomeprazole sodium for intravenous injection/infusion. Oral esomeprazole preparations are enteric-coated, due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is achieved by formulating capsules using the multiple-unit pellet system.

The combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium (brand name Vimovo) is used for the prevention of gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID therapy. Vimovo is available in two dosage strengths: 500/20mg and 375/20mg. Clinical trials of naproxen/esomeprazole demonstrated an incidence of GI ulcer in 24% of patients on naproxen (alone) versus 7% on naproxen/esomeprazole. The FDA has added warnings to the label for Vimovo concerning acute interstitial nephritis and risk of kidney problems in some patients.

=== Multiple-unit pellet system ===
Esomeprazole capsules, as well as Losec/Prilosec tablets, are formulated as a &quot;multiple-unit pellet system&quot; (MUPS). Essentially, the capsule consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by osmosis. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations. Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring nasogastric tube feeding and those with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).

== Society and culture ==

=== Global distribution ===
In 2010, AstraZeneca announced a co-promotion agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to distribute Nexium in Japan. In September 2011, Nexium was approved for sale and was launched by Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. Esomeprazole was approved for use in the United States in February 2001.

===Economics===
Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug netted AstraZeneca about $14.4billion.

=== Controversy ===

There has been some controversy about AstraZeneca&#x27;s behaviour in creating, patenting, and marketing the drug. Esomeprazole&#x27;s successful predecessor, omeprazole, is a mixture of two mirror-imaged molecules (esomeprazole which is the S-enantiomer, and R-omeprazole); critics said the company was trying to &quot;evergreen&quot; its omeprazole patent by patenting the pure esomeprazole and aggressively marketing to doctors that it is more effective than the mixture.

=== Brand names ===
Generic versions of esomeprazole magnesium are available worldwide. It is available over-the-counter under the brand name Nexium in the United States and the UK.

=== Veterinary use ===
Injection formulations of esomeprazole are used for gastroprotection in veterinary medicine. In goats administered the drug by intravenous or subcutaneous injection rapid elimination was noted. In that study the sulfone metabolite was detectable for several hours after injection of the parent drug.

== Other uses ==
Esomeprazole can be used as a parasiticide. Gokmen &quot;et al.&quot;, 2016 screen for efficacy against &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; isolates from horses. They found esomeprazole to be effective as a veterinary antiparasitic.

<text>George McDuffie (August 10, 1790 – March 11, 1851) was the 55th Governor of South Carolina and a member of the United States Senate. Though he began his political career as a partisan of Andrew Jackson, he became one of South Carolina&#x27;s most outspoken advocates of nullification.

== Biography ==
Born of modest means in McDuffie County, Georgia, McDuffie&#x27;s extraordinary intellect was noticed while clerking at a store in Augusta, Georgia. The Calhoun family sponsored his education at Moses Waddel&#x27;s famous Willington Academy, where he established an outstanding reputation. Graduating from South Carolina College in 1813, he was admitted to the bar in 1814, and went into partnership with Eldred Simkins at Edgefield. Rising rapidly, he served in the South Carolina General Assembly in 1818–1821, and in the United States House of Representatives in 1821–1834. In 1834 he became a major general of the South Carolina Militia.

In 1821 he published a pamphlet in which strict states&#x27; rights were strongly denounced; yet in 1832 he became one of the greater nullifiers. The change seems to have been gradual, and to have been determined in part by the influence of John C. Calhoun. When, after 1824, the old Democratic-Republican party split into factions, he followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren in opposing the Panama Congress and the policy of making Federal appropriations for internal improvements. He did not hesitate, however, to differ from Jackson on the two chief issues of his administration: the Bank and nullification.

In 1832 he was a prominent member of the South Carolina Nullification Convention, and drafted its address to the people of the United States. He served as governor in 1834–1836, during which time he helped to reorganize South Carolina College. From January 1843 until January 1846 he was a member of the United States Senate. The leading Democratic measures of those years all received his hearty support. McDuffie, like Calhoun, became an eloquent champion of state sovereignty; but while Calhoun emphasized state action as the only means of redressing a grievance, McDuffie paid more attention to the grievance itself. Influenced in large measure by Thomas Cooper, he made it his special work to convince the people of the South that the downfall of protection was essential to their material progress. In opposing the 1828 Tariff of Abominations he used the illustration that forty bales of every one hundred went to pay tariffs and therefore Northern interests. His argument that it is the producer who really pays the duty of imports has been called the economic basis of nullification.

In 1822, McDuffie fought a series of duels with Colonel William Cumming, suffering wounds that afflicted him for the rest of his life and darkened his already asocial personality:McDuffie was in youth, manhood and old age, a remarkable man for his taciturnity and reserve. He literally seemed to commune with himself; yet there were occasions, when he met with old friends and companions, in which he seemed to enjoy life with as much zest as any man.Benjamin Perley Poore wrote that McDuffie was a &quot;spare, grim-looking man, who was an admirer of Milton, and who was never known to jest or smile.&quot; His oratorical style, too, was &quot;nervous and impassioned, and at times fiercely vehement,&quot; on one occasion even driving the famously combative John Randolph from the floor with &quot;vituperation witheringly pungent&quot;.

While serving in the United States House of Representatives, McDuffie was appointed an impeachment manager to prosecute the articles of impeachment in the impeachment trial of Judge James H. Peck.

George McDuffie died at his estate &quot;Cherry Hill&quot; in Sumter County, South Carolina, on March 11, 1851. McDuffie County, Georgia, is named after him.

<text>Edward Preble (August 15, 1761 – August 25, 1807) was an American naval officer who served in the American Revolutionary War and the First Barbary War, leading attacks on Tripoli and forming the officer corps that would go on to command the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

==Early life==
Edward Preble was born on August 15, 1761 in Falmouth, Massachusetts. He was the son of Jedidiah Preble and his second wife, Mehitable Roberts Preble. Preble was educated in Falmouth before attending the Dummer School in Byfield, Massachusetts. In 1775, the American Revolutionary War broke out, and Preble&#x27;s elder brothers went off to serve in the conflict on the Patriot side. As a result, the responsibility of managing Jedidiah&#x27;s farming interests fell to Preble, &quot;a job he did not like&quot;.

==Revolutionary War service==

In 1778, Preble joined the privateer &quot;Hope&quot; as a common sailor after becoming discontented with farming. However, he quickly switched ships to serve on board the West Indiaman &quot;Merrimack&quot;. In 1780, Preble was appointed as an acting midshipman on board the Massachusetts State Navy frigate &quot;Protector&quot; &quot;thanks in large part to his father&#x27;s influence&quot;. The frigate spent most of the year cruising off New England and the West Indies; on May 26, 1780, &quot;Protector&quot; destroyed the British armed merchantman &quot;Admiral Duff&quot; and captured 55 survivors, who infected Preble and his crewmates with fever. When the frigate reached Boston on August 15, Preble remained on land to recover.

In December 1780, Preble joined the crew of &quot;Protector&quot; as it set out on another commerce raiding expedition. The frigate set out for Nova Scotia before heading south towards the West Indies. Five months later in May 1781, &quot;Protector&quot; encountered the British frigates &quot;Roebuck&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot;, who captured her. Preble was taken prisoner and sent to the prison hulk in New York. After discovering Preble&#x27;s capture, Jedidiah contacted a well-known Loyalist living in New York and asked him to intervene on Preble&#x27;s behalf. On July 24, Preble was exchanged for a captive British officer, returning to Boston two days later and remaining there until 1782. He subsequently joined the Massachusetts States Navy warship &quot;Winthrop&quot;, serving on her until the end of the war. During his time onboard &quot;Winthrop&quot;, Preble led a boarding party which captured a British brig near Penobscot Bay. In 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, bringing the conflict to an end.

==United States Navy service==

Fifteen years of merchant service followed his Revolutionary War career and, in April 1798, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. In January 1799, he assumed command of the 14-gun brig and took her to the West Indies to protect American commerce during the Quasi-War with France. Commissioned as a captain in June 1799, he took command of the 32-gun frigate in December and sailed from Newport, Rhode Island in January 1800 for the Dutch East Indies via the Indian Ocean to convoy home a group of East Indiamen.

Upon his return, Preble announced to the Secretary of the Navy that he intended to retire from the Navy due to his health. Not wanting to lose such an experienced and capable officer, the secretary decided to put Preble on indefinite sick leave until a good post could be found for him.

On 12 January 1802 he was ordered to take command of USS Adams at New York in a letter from the Navy Secretary. In a letter dated 13 April 1802 Preble asked for a furlough due to a rapid decline in his health since arriving in New York in January. His request was granted in a letter dated 16 April.

During this time, the United States was engaged in naval warfare with the city-state of Tripoli, whose corsairs were causing havoc amongst American merchantmen in the Mediterranean. The U.S. Navy had sent squadrons under two commanders, Richard Dale and Richard Valentine Morris, to protect American interests in the region. While Dale ran an effective blockade of Tripoli, the endless routine bored his officers. Upon his return, Dale left the Navy over a promotion dispute. The tenure of Richard Valentine Morris, on the other hand, was an utter fiasco, as Morris was neither an effective commander nor a very smart one. Morris spent most of his time socializing in Gibraltar and Malta, and he managed to be taken hostage by the Bey of Tunis, who felt that the American did not give him an adequate farewell (the ransom was paid by the American and Danish consuls). When he finally did arrive at Tripoli, he tried to play diplomat and sue for peace, which destabilized the strong negotiating position the Americans had been building up to that point. When Morris returned home, he was stripped of his commission by President Thomas Jefferson without so much as a court-martial.

With Morris ordered home, President Jefferson needed a new officer to command the Mediterranean Squadron. Bypassing several senior officers, Preble, who was in Boston supervising the construction of a new Brig for the navy was ordered in a letter dated 14 May 1803 to take command also of, and ready, for duty in the Mediterranean. He accepted in a letter dated 19 May, and was given a promotion to commodore along with his new ship. He sailed on August 14, 1803.

===To the Mediterranean===
On September 10, &quot;Constitution&quot; was approaching Cadiz on a black, moonless night. Suddenly, the dim silhouette of a warship loomed out of the darkness close aboard. Preble immediately ordered &quot;Constitution&quot; cleared for action. Preble hailed her, only to receive a hail in return. He identified his ship as the United States frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; but received an evasive answer from the other ship. Preble replied: &quot;I am now going to hail you for the last time. If a proper answer is not returned, I will fire a shot into you.&quot; The stranger returned, &quot;If you give me a shot, I&#x27;ll give you a broadside.&quot; Preble demanded that the other ship identify herself and the stranger replied, &quot;This is His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ship &quot;Donegal&quot;, 84 guns, Sir Richard Strachan, an English commodore.&quot; He then commanded Preble, &quot;Send your boat on board.&quot; Preble was now devoid of all patience and exclaimed, &quot;This is United States Ship &quot;Constitution&quot;, 44 guns, Edward Preble, an American commodore, who will be damned before he sends his boat on board of any vessel.&quot; And then to his gun crews: &quot;Blow your matches, boys!&quot; Before the incident escalated further, however, a boat arrived from the other ship and a British lieutenant relayed his captain&#x27;s apologies. The ship was in fact not &quot;Donegal&quot; but instead , a 32-gun frigate. &quot;Constitution&quot; had come alongside her so quietly that &quot;Maidstone&quot; had delayed answering with the proper hail while she readied her guns. This act began the strong allegiance between Preble and the officers under his command, known as &quot;Preble&#x27;s boys&quot;, as he had shown that he was willing to defy a presumed ship of the line.

===Second Battle of Tripoli Harbor===


After signing a peace treaty with Morocco, Preble established a blockade off Tripoli. Stephen Decatur, William Bainbridge, Charles Stewart, Isaac Hull, Thomas Macdonough, James Lawrence, and David Porter served under his command at Tripoli.

While commanding in Tripoli, Preble masterminded the burning of by Lieutenant Stephen Decatur on February 16, 1804, preventing the captured frigate from falling into enemy hands. Had Tripoli gained the use of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, the entire blockade would have been wasted. Stephen Decatur and his younger brother, James Decatur, led the actual operation.

James Decatur was killed in the fighting later that year aboard one of the squadron&#x27;s attack craft.


Over the course of his career, Preble helped establish many of the modern Navy&#x27;s rules and regulations. Described as a stern taskmaster, he kept high discipline upon the ships under his command. He also dictated that his ships be kept in a state of readiness for any action while under sail, something many US naval officers at the time did not insist upon. Future sea captains such as Decatur, Lawrence, and Porter took his procedures to heart at a time when the US Navy was highly unregulated. Many of Preble&#x27;s procedures became doctrine after the establishment of an official US Navy. The officers serving under him during his career also went on to become influential in the Navy Department after his death, and together they proudly wore the unofficial title of &quot;Preble&#x27;s Boys&quot;. (When Preble took over command he discovered that his oldest officer was 30 and the youngest 15 years old. He therefore grumbled the Secretary of the Navy had given him &quot;just a pack of schoolboys&quot;.)

Preble&#x27;s Mediterranean cruise led directly to the US government&#x27;s firm anti-negotiation stance. Many Mediterranean states, including Tripoli, had been pirating American shipping vessels, ransoming the sailors, and demanding tribute to prevent future pirate attacks. The tribute rose after each successful payment, as did the brutality and boldness of the attacks.

==Later career==
In September 1804, Commodore Preble requested relief due to a longtime illness. He returned to the United States in February 1805 and became engaged in the comparably light duty of shipbuilding activities at Portland, Maine. By congressional resolution in March 1805, a gold medal was struck and presented to Commodore Preble for the &quot;gallantry and good conduct&quot; of himself and his squadron at Tripoli. President Jefferson offered him the Navy Department in 1806, but Preble declined appointment due to his poor health.

Preble died in Portland of a gastrointestinal illness on August 25, 1807. He is buried in Eastern Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

==Personal life==
On March 17, 1801, Preble was married to Mary Deering (1770–1851) in Portland, Maine. Mary was a daughter of Nathaniel Deering and Dorcas (née Milk) Deering. Together, they were the parents of one child:

* Edward Deering Preble (1806–1846), who married Sophia Elizabeth Wattles (1813–1889) in 1833.
Preble&#x27;s widow and son lived in a mansion which stood at the corner of today&#x27;s Congress Street and Preble Street between 1808 and 1860. It was demolished and replaced firstly by Preble House, then by the Chapman Building in 1924.

<text>Fritz Pregl (; 3 September 1869 – 13 December 1930), was a Slovenian-Austrian chemist and physician from a mixed Slovene-German-speaking background. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1923 for making important contributions to quantitative organic microanalysis, one of which was the improvement of the combustion train technique for elemental analysis.

==Biography==

Pregl was born in Ljubljana within Austria-Hungary to a Slovene-speaking father and German-speaking mother. He was baptized &quot;Friedrich Michael Raimund Pregl&quot;. He died in Graz, Austria in 1930.

Pregl started his career as chemist after he studied medicine at the University of Graz. With his focus on physiology and especially chemical physiology, he suffered from the limitations of quantitative organic microanalysis. The small quantities of substances he obtained during the research of bile acid made it necessary to improve the process of elemental analysis by reducing the necessary components. At the end of his research, he had lowered the minimal amount of substance necessary for the analysis process by a factor of 50. He invited chemists to learn his method of elemental analysis, so that the method was soon widely accepted.
==Commemoration==
In 1950, the department of the University of Graz where Fritz Pregl had worked was named the Institute of Medical Chemistry and Pregl Laboratory. Streets in Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna and Klagenfurt were named after him. In Slovenia, Pregl Awards have been bestowed annually since 2007 by the National Institute of Chemistry for the research work and for outstanding doctorates. Slovenian pupils are conferred Pregl Recognition Awards, whereas secondary school students are conferred Pregl Citations for excellent results in national competitions in chemistry. A square in Ljubljana is named after Pregl. The Fritz Pregl Prize has been awarded annually since 1931 in chemistry by the Austrian Academy of Sciences from the funds left at its disposal by Pregl.

<doc id="769176" wikidata="Q2348724" url="?curid=769176" title="Deltoid curve">
<text>In geometry, a deltoid curve, also known as a tricuspoid curve or Steiner curve, is a hypocycloid of three cusps. In other words, it is the roulette created by a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls without slipping along the inside of a circle with three or one-and-a-half times its radius. It is named after the capital Greek letter delta (Δ) which it resembles.

More broadly, a &quot;deltoid&quot; can refer to any closed figure with three vertices connected by curves that are concave to the exterior, making the interior points a non-convex set.

==Equations==
A hypocycloid can be represented (up to rotation and translation) by the following parametric equations
:formula_1
:formula_2
where &quot;a&quot; is the radius of the rolling circle, &quot;b&quot; is the radius of the circle within which the aforementioned circle is rolling and &quot;t&quot; ranges from zero to 6. (In the illustration above &quot;b = 3a&quot; tracing the deltoid.)

In complex coordinates this becomes
:formula_3.

The variable &quot;t&quot; can be eliminated from these equations to give the Cartesian equation
:formula_4
so the deltoid is a plane algebraic curve of degree four. In polar coordinates this becomes
:formula_5
The curve has three singularities, cusps corresponding to formula_6. The parameterization above implies that the curve is rational which implies it has genus zero.

A line segment can slide with each end on the deltoid and remain tangent to the deltoid. The point of tangency travels around the deltoid twice while each end travels around it once.

The dual curve of the deltoid is
:formula_7
which has a double point at the origin which can be made visible for plotting by an imaginary rotation y ↦ iy, giving the curve
:formula_8
with a double point at the origin of the real plane.

==Area and perimeter==

The area of the deltoid is formula_9 where again &quot;a&quot; is the radius of the rolling circle; thus the area of the deltoid is twice that of the rolling circle.

The perimeter (total arc length) of the deltoid is 16&quot;a&quot;.

== History ==
Ordinary cycloids were studied by Galileo Galilei and Marin Mersenne as early as 1599 but cycloidal curves were first conceived by Ole Rømer in 1674 while studying the best form for gear teeth. Leonhard Euler claims first consideration of the actual deltoid in 1745 in connection with an optical problem.

== Applications ==
Deltoids arise in several fields of mathematics. For instance:

* The set of complex eigenvalues of unistochastic matrices of order three forms a deltoid.
* A cross-section of the set of unistochastic matrices of order three forms a deltoid.
* The set of possible traces of unitary matrices belonging to the group SU(3) forms a deltoid.
* The intersection of two deltoids parametrizes a family of complex Hadamard matrices of order six.
* The set of all Simson lines of given triangle, form an envelope in the shape of a deltoid. This is known as the Steiner deltoid or Steiner&#x27;s hypocycloid after Jakob Steiner who described the shape and symmetry of the curve in 1856.
* The envelope of the area bisectors of a triangle is a deltoid (in the broader sense defined above) with vertices at the midpoints of the medians. The sides of the deltoid are arcs of hyperbolas that are asymptotic to the triangle&#x27;s sides. 
* A deltoid was proposed as a solution to the Kakeya needle problem.

* Ideal triangle, a three-cusped curve formed from hyperbolic lines

<text>Edmond Francis Prendergast (May 3, 1843 – February 26, 1918) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1911 until his death in 1918.

==Biography==
Edmond Prendergast was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland, to Lawrence and Joanna (née Carew) Prendergast. Three of his uncles and two brothers were also priests, and two sisters entered religious life. While a theological student in his native country, he accepted an invitation from one of his uncles to come to the United States in 1859. He then enrolled at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he proved to be a talented student. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop James Frederick Wood on November 17, 1865.
Prendergast then served as a curate at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia until May 1866, when he was transferred to the mission in Susquehanna Depot on account of his health. He was pastor of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Bristol from 1867 to 1871. He then served at Immaculate Conception Church in Allentown until February 1874, when he returned to Philadelphia as rector of St. Malachy&#x27;s Church. In addition to his duties at St. Malachy&#x27;s, he was named vicar general of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in 1895. He also served as director of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.

On November 27, 1895, Prendergast was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia and Titular Bishop of &quot;Scilium&quot; by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on February 24, 1897 from Archbishop Patrick John Ryan, with Bishops Ignatius Frederick Horstmann and Michael John Hoban serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul. For 15 years he continued his work as vicar general and pastor of St. Malachy&#x27;s, and assisted Archbishop Ryan in ordaining priests, administering Confirmation, dedicating churches, chapels and schools, officiating at the reception of novices and at the solemn profession of numerous nuns in the archdiocese. He also served as chairman of the Archdiocesan Building Committee; under his leadership, the Catholic Protectory for Boys, Archbishop Ryan Memorial Library, Catholic Home for Girls, and Catholic Girls&#x27; High School were erected. Following the death of Archbishop Ryan in February 1911, he was named Apostolic Administrator.
===Archbishop===
Prendergast was named the third Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope Pius X on May 27, 1911. He was later installed at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul on July 26, 1911. In attendance at his installation was the likes of Mayor John E. Reyburn and Judge Mayer Sulzberger. Due to his own advanced age (68), he received John Joseph McCort as an auxiliary in 1912. During his episcopate, he was known as a master builder and a real-estate genius. He increased the number of parishes and parochial schools for the great number of Italian and Eastern European immigrants in Philadelphia.

In 1913, he opened the Archbishop Memorial Institute for the Deaf. He founded Saint Francis Country Home for Convalescents and in 1916 established Saint Edmond&#x27;s Home to meet the needs of children affected by the polio epidemic. In 1917, he founded St. Vincent&#x27;s Orphanage, which would later become Archbishop Prendergast High School.

Prendergast died at the episcopal residence on February 26, 1918.

In 2005, Archbishop Prendergast High School for Young Women in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, merged with Monsignor Bonner High School for Young Men to create Bonner &amp; Prendergast Catholic High School.

<text>Het Steen is a medieval fortress in the old city centre of Antwerp, Belgium, one of Europe&#x27;s biggest ports. The surviving structure was built between 1200 and 1225 as a gateway to a larger castle of the Dukes of Brabant which was demolished in the 19th century. As the first stone fortification (city wall) of Antwerp, Het Steen is Antwerp&#x27;s oldest building and used to be part of its oldest urban centre. The words &quot;Het Steen&quot;, translated from Dutch mean &quot;the rock&quot; in English, although that is not the equivalent etymological meaning.

== History ==
The first documented mention of Antwerp (fortified) city dates back to the 12th century. However, there was a settlement and a castle (donjon) here as early as the Carolingian period in the 9th century. The first fortifications may have been built after the Viking incursions in the early Middle Ages; in 879 the Normans invaded Flanders. The Margraviate of Antwerp came into being around 974. The Duchy of Lower Lotharingia was part of the Holy Roman Empire, while on the opposite bank of the Scheldt lay the county of Flanders, which was subordinate to the king of France. From 1076 to 1100 Godfrey of Bouillon was the Margrave of Antwerp. Godfrey I, Count of Louvain, received the duchy in 1106. His great-grandson was Henry I, Duke of Brabant who received the Duchy of Brabant in 1183.

Previously known as Antwerpen Burcht (fortress), the walled city of which the only visible remains are parts of the first stone fortification wall and house Het Steen. The building, which was built against the fortification wall and adjacent to the south city gate, gained its current name in around 1520, after significant rebuilding under Charles V. The rebuilding led to its being known first as &quot;&#x27;s Heeren Steen&quot; (the King&#x27;s stone castle), and later simply as &quot;Het Steen&quot; (the stone castle). The Dutch word &quot;steen&quot; means &quot;stone&quot;, and used to be used for &quot;fortress&quot; or &quot;palace&quot;, as in the &quot;Gravensteen&quot; in Ghent, Belgium.

The fortress made it possible to control the access to the Scheldt, the adjacent river.

The house Het Steen was later used as the &quot;schepenbank&quot; (Alderman&#x27;s house or city hall) and &quot;vierschaar&quot; (court of justice). It was used as a prison between 1303 and 1827.

== Modern use ==
The largest part of the fortress, including dozens of historic houses and the oldest church of the city, was demolished in the 19th century when the quays were straightened to stop the silting up of the Scheldt. The remaining building, heavily changed, contains a shipping museum, with some old canal barges displayed on the quay outside.

In 1890 Het Steen became the museum of archeology and in 1952 an annex was added to house the museum of Antwerp maritime history, which in 2011 moved to the nearby Museum Aan de Stroom. Here is also a war memorial to the Canadian soldiers in World War II.

At the entrance to Het Steen is a bas-relief of Semini, above the archway, around 2nd century. Semini is the Scandinavian God of youth and fertility (with symbolic phallus). A historical plaque near Het Steen explains that women of the town appealed to Semini when they desired children; the god was reviled by later religious clergy. Inhabitants of Antwerp previously referred to themselves as &quot;children of Semini&quot;. An organization concerned with the historic preservation of Het Steen and Semini, Antwerp Komitee Semini in Ere (AKSIE), formed in 1986, holds annual celebrations at Het Steen as cultural events.

At the entrance bridge to the castle is a statue of a giant and two humans. It depicts the giant Lange Wapper who used to terrorise the inhabitants of the city in medieval times.

A major renovation of Het Steen was completed in October 2021, when it reopened as a visitor center with a modern concrete extension.

== In popular culture ==
Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, which premiered in 1850, is set in Antwerp Castle around the year 933 under the reign of Henry the Fowler, with Elsa von Brabant as the main female protagonist and the swan knight Lohengrin, who magically appears on the river on a barge pulled by a swan when the king holds court hearing on the bank. Ludwig II of Bavaria had Neuschwanstein Castle designed by stage designers in 1869; its narrow rectangular inner courtyard is designed according to Wagner&#x27;s stage directions for Antwerp Castle, with Elsa&#x27;s wing on the left including the covered balcony on which she stands at the beginning of the second act.

<text>Maurice Brazil Prendergast (October 10, 1858 – February 1, 1924) was an American artist who painted in oil and watercolor, and created monotypes. His delicate landscapes and scenes of modern life, characterized by mosaic-like color, are generally associated with Post-Impressionism. Prendergast, however, was also a member of The Eight, a group of early twentieth-century American artists who, aside from Prendergast, represented the Ashcan School.

==Biography==
Maurice Prendergast and his twin sister, Lucy, were born at their family&#x27;s subarctic trading post in the city of St. John&#x27;s, in Newfoundland, then a colony in British North America. After the trading post failed, the family moved to Boston. He grew up in the South End and was apprenticed as a youth to a commercial artist. At 14 he went to work in a dry goods store as a package wrapper. This conditioned him from the start to the brightly colored, flat patterning effects that characterized his mature work. He was also inspired by the example of Boston Impressionist Childe Hassam. A shy individual who experienced increasing deafness in his later years, Prendergast remained a bachelor throughout his life. He became closely attached to his younger brother Charles, who was also a post-impressionist painter.

Prendergast studied in Paris from 1891 to 1895, at the Académie Colarossi with Gustave Courtois and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and at the Académie Julian. During one of his early stays in Paris, he met the Canadian painter James Morrice, who introduced him to English avant-garde artists Walter Sickert and Aubrey Beardsley, all ardent admirers of James McNeill Whistler. A further acquaintance with Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard placed him firmly in the Post-Impressionist camp. He also studied the work of Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat at retrospectives held in Paris in 1891 and 1892. Prendergast was additionally one of the first Americans to espouse the work of Paul Cézanne and to understand and utilize his expressive use of form and color.

Prendergast returned to Boston in 1895 and worked mainly in watercolor and monotyping. A trip to Venice in 1898 exposed him to the genre scenes of Vittore Carpaccio and encouraged him to experiment with even more complex and rhythmic arrangements. His inventive watercolors of Venice are among his most appreciated works today. In 1900, he had major exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago and at Macbeth Galleries in New York, which earned him critical acclaim. He showed in a National Arts Club exhibition in 1904, through which he befriended the painters William Glackens, Robert Henri, and John French Sloan. He exhibited with them in 1908 at Macbeth Galleries, along with George Luks, Everett Shinn, and Arthur B. Davies, a group collectively known after the show as The Eight. Glackens in particular became a lifelong friend.

Despite poor health that hindered his work, Prendergast continued to show in major exhibitions throughout the remainder of his life. Important collectors like Albert Barnes and Ferdinand Howald became his patrons after his shows at the Carroll Gallery and the Daniel Gallery. His seven works at the landmark Armory Show of 1913 presented examples of his stylistic maturity. Seen in company with the most adventurous examples of Post-Impressionism and Fauvism, &quot;his critical reception grew more favorable in [the] immediate aftermath [of that exhibition.]&quot; In 1916, he participated in the &quot;Fifty at Montross&quot; show at the Montross Gallery, which also included works by Cézanne, Matisse, Seurat, and Van Gogh. His work was the subject of a retrospective at Joseph Brummer Gallery in 1921, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art declined to host a Prendergast memorial retrospective after his death in 1924; at that time, his art was still seen as too demanding and advanced for the Metropolitan&#x27;s trustees. His first New York memorial exhibition was held ten years later at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

==&quot;The Eight&quot;==
Prendergast exhibited at the Macbeth Galleries in 1908 with the short-lived association of artists known as &quot;The Eight&quot; because he supported their protest against the academic bias and restrictive exhibition policies of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design. He believed in a &quot;no jury, no prizes&quot; openness that would allow independent or unconventional artists greater opportunities to find a wider, appreciative audience for their work. This controversial exhibition, which acquired legendary status in American art history, is seen as a seminal moment in the public response to Ashcan realism, as that form of gritty urban representational art was the style practiced by five of the participants (Henri, Sloan, Luks, Shinn, and Glackens), but Prendergast has nothing in common, in style or content, with that school of painting. Prendergast was far more a Modernist than any of the other seven members of The Eight. His ties to The Eight did not necessarily help his reputation in the long run: &quot;Prendergast&#x27;s irrevocable association with The Eight left him stylistically isolated in genealogies of modern art.&quot; A true independent, he fits into no particular category of modern American art.

==Work==
Prendergast&#x27;s work was strongly associated from the beginning with leisurely scenes set on beaches and in parks. His early work was mostly in watercolor or monotype, and he produced over two hundred monotypes between 1895 and 1902. He also experimented with oil painting in the 1890s, but did not focus on that medium until the early 1900s.

He developed early in his career and continued throughout his life to elaborate a highly personal style, with boldly contrasting, jewel-like colors, and flattened, pattern-like forms rhythmically arranged on a canvas. Forms were radically simplified and presented in flat areas of bright, unmodulated color. His paintings have been aptly described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.

<text>Patrick J. Prendergast FIEI, MRIA, FREng is an Irish engineer, specialised in bioengineering, who served as the 44th Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 2011 to 2021. He has published more than 200 papers and volumes, and been cited widely.

==Early life and education==
Born in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, Ireland, Prendergast grew up in the nearby village of Oulart, and received his secondary education at St Peter&#x27;s College, Wexford. He then studied at Trinity College Dublin as an undergraduate, from 1983, completing a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1987 and a PhD in 1991 titled &quot;Structural Analysis of the Artificial Hip Joint&quot;. He wrote an account of his undergraduate years in &quot;Trinity Tales. Trinity College Dublin in the Eighties&quot;. 

==Academic career==
After post-doctoral positions in Bologna, Italy, and Nijmegen, Netherlands, he became a lecturer at Trinity in 1995 and was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1998. With colleagues from medicine and dentistry, he established the Trinity Centre for Bioengineering in 2002, and was appointed as a Personal Chair in Bio-Engineering in 2007. He is credited with adding biomechanics as a topic area to Trinity&#x27;s engineering syllabus, and developing a Master&#x27;s in Bioengineering.

He served as Dean of Graduate Studies at Trinity from 2004 to 2007 and was appointed Vice-Provost / Chief Academic Officer in 2008. 

===Research===
Prendergast has published more than 200 articles and volumes, including on topics around medical engineering, such as tissue mechanobiology, and the design of implants. His work has won funding from Science Foundation Ireland, often as Principal Investigator, as well as from the EU and some industry sources. He was a member of the Glion Colloquium of University Presidents where he published two papers on strategy and leadership. 

===Provostship===
In 2011, he was elected as the 44th Provost of Trinity College, for a ten-year term. For external purposes, the post is elaborated to &quot;Provost and President&quot;. During his term, Prendergast has focused on the university&#x27;s rankings from QS, the Times HES and Shanghai, and on increasing sources of funding. 

In September 2016, a &quot;Provost&#x27;s Council&quot; was created, made up of alumni and benefactors of the university, it advises the Provost on how Trinity might advance, for example by financing new projects and initiatives. In November 2016, it was announced that Trinity College Dublin would be joining the League of European Research Universities (LERU). It is the first and only university on the island of Ireland to become a member. 

In May 2018, Prendergast unveiled plans for a new €60 million Institute in Engineering, Environment and Emerging Technologies (E3), funded by an Irish philanthropic donation and Government funding, and the E3 Learning Foundry is now under construction in the university. The renovation of the magnificent Old Library of Trinity College, with a €25m contribution announced by government Minister Darragh O’Brien of Fianna Fail, is also going ahead. However, it is not known if a more a more controversial project to develop a new campus announced as Trinity East with the Grand Canal Innovation District will proceed.

In April 2019, Prendergast gave a wide-ranging interview to the music magazine Hot Press. He was involved in several controversies, most notably over branding and &quot;Take Back Trinity&quot;, a student movement to resist commercialisation within the university. He was often accused of being out of touch with student and staff concerns. Despite this he wrote a monthly article for the &quot;Irish Times&quot; on Higher Education espousing his views on how Irish higher education should develop, one of which proposed a Cabinet Minister and associated Department for Higher Education. This idea, considered far-fetched at the time, was implemented by the new Taoiseach Micheál Martin, his main change in the new government formation. Prendergast gave his last speech as Provost to Northern Ireland alumni advocating special measures for NI students not to pay the non-EU fee post-Brexit. The students’ final assessment of Prendergast was probably a good summary: “His trademark lack of regard for the on-the-ground effects of his decisions had a certain nobility to it. One may disagree with them, but at least there was no pretence of consensus building”.

==Chairperson and Board memberships==
Prendergast has several chairperson roles that bring him to public attention. In February 2022 he was appointed by Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris as the Chairperson of the South East Technological University, a new university in Ireland. In this capacity he made some comments to the national media about student accommodation which has critical comment by architects. 

He was a member of the Board of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (headquarters in Budapest) for eight years. 

He is currently Chairperson of the Board of the Douglas Hyde Gallery of Contemporary Art and formerly chaired the Board of Science Gallery International.

==Recognition==
In 2009, Prendergast was awarded an ScD for published works in Bioengineering. He is a member of the Royal Irish Academy in the Sciences division, and since 2013, an International Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He gave the Wartenweiler Lecture of the International Society of Biomechanics in 2009, and the Richard Skalak Lecture of the Biomedical Engineering Department of Columbia University in 2014. For his scientific contributions he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Anatomical Society in 2016, and an Honorary Member of the European Society of Biomechanics in 2018.

==In popular culture==
Prendergast was portrayed by Frank Smith in the 2020 miniseries Normal People.

<text>Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast (6 April 1868 – 13 July 1894) was an Irish-born American newspaper distributor who assassinated Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison III, fatally shooting the five-term mayor on October 28, 1893. Following two separate trials, in which the defense tried unsuccessfully to have him acquitted by reason of insanity, Prendergast was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death for the assassination. He was executed by hanging on July 13, 1894, the only client of famed attorney Clarence Darrow to ever receive the death penalty.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Prendergast was born on 6 April 1868 in Cloonamore townland, Inishbofin, an island off the west coast of Ireland. He was baptised in St Colman&#x27;s Church on 12 April 1868 His parents were Ellen King (1837–1914) and Patrick Prendergast (1840–1886), both of whom were described as teachers at their marriage in Inishbofin on 2 July 1865. His grandfather, William Prendergast, who lost an arm in Pamplona, was an army pensioner who was reported to have died insane. His mother had &quot;repeated attacks of hysterics&quot; and his father died of consumption.

Prendergast was reported to have suffered a severe head injury from a fall at the age of four, from which he was unconscious for a long period of time and suffered vomiting for four weeks after. He was described as a peculiar child, solitary, irritable and excitable, with a poor memory who did poorly in school. Patrick arrived in New York on 20 May 1873, aged 5, traveling with his brother John, aged 8, on the SS &quot;France&quot;. In Chicago, he attended several Catholic schools, including St. Patrick&#x27;s Academy. He left home at the age of 16 because of imaginary persecution. He first left home for two weeks. After returning home, he briefly attended the Holy Name School. He soon dropped out of school and took a job as a Western Union messenger, in order to supplement the low income that his father brought home. However, he soon found himself in what he believed to be a state of decline, and left home for twelve weeks. During this time, he stayed in New Mexico. After this time, he returned home looking disheveled. He thereafter took jobs at the &quot;Chicago Globe&quot; and &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot;. 

At the age of seventeen, he became more socially withdrawn, and began refusing to share a room at night with his brother. He also became obsessed with the writings of Henry George. By the age of, he 18 had fully developed grandiose views of his own capabilities and had fully become a fanatic for the single-tax ideology promoted by George.

While working as a newspaper distributor in Chicago, Prendergast lobbied for improvements in Chicago&#x27;s railroad grade crossings, which he saw as a danger to the public. In 1893, he supported Carter Harrison&#x27;s re-election campaign under the delusion that if Harrison won the election, Prendergast would receive an appointment as Corporation Counsel. Harrison was elected mayor in April 1893, to a non-consecutive fifth term. Before and after the election, Prendergast wrote numerous letters to and visited the offices of prominent politicians associated with Harrison&#x27;s campaign.

===Assassination of Mayor Harrison===

When the appointment did not come, Prendergast visited Harrison at his home on October 28, 1893, ringing the doorbell at 7:50 p.m. He was admitted by a maid who went to wake the mayor, who was taking a nap on a sofa in the parlor. As Harrison stepped into the hallway from the parlor, Prendergast approached and shot the mayor three times with a .38 revolver, hitting him first in the abdomen above the navel, a second time under the left arm with a shot that pierced his heart, and a third time at point-blank range through the left hand.

Harrison&#x27;s coachman, hearing the gunfire, ran towards the site of the shooting with a pistol of his own, firing three times at the escaping Prendergast without hitting him, while avoiding being hit when Prendergast returned fire. Mortally wounded, Harrison died in his home at 8:25 p.m.

The escaping assassin was chased down Ashland Avenue by several citizens and a police officer, who ran after him to the Des Plaines Street police station, where Prendergast immediately surrendered. He still had the gun in his possession. When interviewed by police, he gave varying stories as to his motive, including the failed appointment and the mayor&#x27;s failure to elevate train track crossings. The smell of burned powder and the revolver&#x27;s empty chambers reaffirmed to the police department that Prendergast was telling the truth.

Prendergast was taken from the Des Plaines Street station to the Central Station, located downtown, where the building was quickly surrounded by a crowd of 5,000 people. Fearing potential mob violence, at 11:15 p.m., Prendergast was stealthily hurried into a wagon and taken to another station located on the North Side of the city, where he was lodged in the county jail pending trial.

===Trials===
In his first trial, Prendergast&#x27;s attorney tried to have him declared insane. Chicago lawyers disagreed, as Prendergast had taken special care to keep an empty chamber in his revolver as he carried it around. This demonstrated rationality because carrying a revolver of that era with a live round under the hammer could cause it to go off if dropped; having the forethought to leave the chamber safely empty demonstrated sanity. Modern revolvers have safety features to prevent such accidental discharges. Several doctors testified that while Prendergast was paranoid, he knew right from wrong and was capable of standing trial for the murder. Clarence Darrow later won a hearing on Prendergast&#x27;s sanity, but the defense also failed in the second trial and Prendergast was found guilty. He was sentenced to death.

===Execution===

At 10 a.m. on the morning of July 13, 1894, Cook County Sheriff James H. Gilbert visited Prendergast&#x27;s cell and read him the death warrant issued in his case. He was visited one last time by his brother John at 11 a.m., by which time hope for a last-minute reprieve from Governor John Altgeld had dissipated. He was visited by a doctor at 11:30 and spent a brief time with a priest, declaring that there had been no malice in the killing of Mayor Harrison. Five minutes before his scheduled 11:45 execution, Prendergast&#x27;s attorney, S.S. Gregory, arrived and was allowed to shake his client&#x27;s hand one last time and to exchange a few words.

A gallows had been constructed in the north corridor of the jail and seats placed between the row of cells along the north side and the high building wall. Prisoners facing the corridor were removed from their cells to a place where the execution would not be visible, and about 500 ticketed witnesses were assembled, which included the members of the jury which convicted him. At 11:43 the order was given to march and Prendergast was led to the gallows, accompanied by Father Gilbert of the Cathedral of the Holy Name, who was on hand to administer the last rites of the Catholic Church.

Prendergast walked to the edge of the trap without assistance, where his hands were fastened. Although having previously planned to make a last statement, he had been dissuaded by the priest, to whom he quietly delivered his last words, &quot;I had no malice against anyone.&quot; Prendergast&#x27;s feet, knees, and chest were bound with straps and a white shroud placed over him and he was taken onto the trap, where the noose was placed around his neck. A white muslin hood was placed over his head and the noose, obscuring both from view.

A signal was given and at 11:48 the rope holding the heavy trap in place was cut. Prendergast&#x27;s neck was broken by the six-foot drop and his body did not move after the fall. Prendergast&#x27;s heart continued to beat for about ten minutes, after which it ceased; five minutes later his body was taken down and placed in an awaiting coffin for burial.

== Media depictions ==
On occasion, Prendergast has been represented in film or fiction. In the 1991 made-for-TV movie &quot;Darrow&quot;, he was portrayed by New York-born actor Paul Klementowicz. Prendergast&#x27;s story is one of the subplots in Erik Larson&#x27;s 2003 best-selling non-fiction book &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;. Patrick was also referenced in &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; during a city hotspot checkin in which you can visit the police station and briefly read about it.

<text>Samuel Prescott (August 19, 1751 – ) was an American physician and a Massachusetts Patriot during the American Revolutionary War. He is best known for his role in Paul Revere&#x27;s &quot;midnight ride&quot; to warn the townspeople of Concord, Massachusetts, of the impending British army move to capture guns and gunpowder kept there at the beginning of the American Revolution. He was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord.

== Early life ==
Little is known for certain about Prescott&#x27;s life outside of his involvement in the dramatic events before and during the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He was born on August 19, 1751. He grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, where his family had lived for generations. He became a physician, as his father and grandfather had been before him.

According to tradition, Samuel Prescott was courting Lydia Mulliken of Lexington, Massachusetts, just prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution. Lydia lived with her widowed mother, four brothers and two sisters in a home across Cambridge Road from Munroe&#x27;s Tavern. Her older sibling, Nathanial, worked in his late father&#x27;s clock shop and was a member of Captain John Parker&#x27;s militia.

Due to the fact that Paul Revere referred to Prescott as a &quot;high son of Liberty,&quot; (meaning an ardent supporter of the Patriot cause), some have speculated that Prescott had ties to the Sons of Liberty or acted as a courier for the Committees of Correspondence prior to the start of the Revolution.

== The Midnight Ride ==

On the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere and William Dawes were dispatched by Joseph Warren to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were then in Lexington, that a British expedition was on its way to arrest them. Warren also instructed Revere and Dawes to warn provincial officials in Concord that British troops intended to confiscate or destroy the armaments being amassed there by the province&#x27;s militia. Revere and Dawes took different routes but met in Lexington about midnight and successfully warned Adams and Hancock, who quickly left Lexington. Revere and Dawes then proceeded towards Concord to complete their second mission.

Samuel Prescott was headed home to Concord from the home of a lady friend in Lexington when he encountered Revere and Dawes on horseback around 1 a.m. on April 19. Revere later described their meeting in his 1775 deposition to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and in a 1798 letter to Jeremy Belknap. Revere claimed that Prescott was a &quot;high son of Liberty&quot;--suggesting that he was trustworthy. Upon hearing about their mission, Prescott offered to assist Revere and Dawes, pointing out that he was known in the area and residents would be more likely to believe a warning coming from him rather than strangers.

Proceeding along the road to Concord, the three riders warned residents of several houses in Lincoln, Massachusetts, by knocking on doors. It was in Lincoln, not far from the Concord town line, that a British mounted patrol intercepted the three riders. The British soldiers were part of a larger scouting party sent out from Boston the previous evening to stop any provincial alarm riders or couriers. The soldiers captured Revere but both Prescott and Dawes escaped. Dawes was thrown from his horse and went back to Lexington. Prescott, according to Revere&#x27;s account, took off on horseback towards a stone wall, jumped his horse over it, and disappeared into dense woods. After riding through woods and swamp, Prescott emerged at the Hartwell Tavern. He alerted the Hartwell family who, in turn, raced off to warn others. Word soon reached Capt. William Smith, commander of the Lincoln minutemen, who ordered the town bell rung as a signal for his company to muster.

On his way to Concord, Prescott alerted other houses in Lincoln and soon additional riders rode off to alert other towns. When Prescott arrived in Concord, he gave word to the sentry there and the Concord First Parish Church bell was rung to alert the town. Thus Prescott completed the second objective given to Revere and Dawes. In Concord, Prescott bid his brother Abel to ride to Sudbury to alert companies there while, according to tradition, Samuel rode to Acton and Stow to carry the alarm there. Abel was fired on by a British regular who spotted him as he was returning from Acton and Stow; he was slightly wounded in the side, but succeeded in making his escape by secreting himself in the house of a Mrs. Heywood. Due to Prescott&#x27;s efforts that night, the minuteman and militia companies in numerous towns were alerted, mustered, and marched to Concord in time to engage the British Army at the Old North Bridge and other locations along the road to Boston.

== Later career ==
Details relating to Prescott&#x27;s life after the ride are scant and inconclusive. According to historian D. Michael Ryan, a record of a &quot;Dr. Sall Prescott&quot; serving as a surgeon at Fort Ticonderoga in 1776 has led many historians to conclude that Prescott served the Continental Army in a medical capacity. A Revolutionary War veteran from Ashburnham, Massachusetts, recorded in his memoir that he had been imprisoned by the British in a prison in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with a Dr. Prescott. According to this account, Prescott died in prison in 1777. Although corroborating evidence that this was Dr. Samuel Prescott of Concord is lacking, these details are most often accepted as fact.

== Legacy ==
Prescott&#x27;s arrival in Concord is reenacted every year at midnight on April 19. The reenactment is preceded by a Patriots&#x27; Ball and a procession by modern day Minuteman, ceremonial honor guards, and fife and drum units. Prescott&#x27;s supposed ride through Acton is reenacted every Patriots&#x27; Day beginning in East Acton and concluding at the Liberty Tree Farm, where once stood the home of a minuteman named Simon Hunt.

In 1965, the Concord Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a memorial plaque to Prescott at the location of his home in Concord.

<doc id="769201" wikidata="Q2737008" url="?curid=769201" title="Legation">
<text>A legation was a diplomatic representative office of lower rank than an embassy. Where an embassy was headed by an ambassador, a legation was headed by a minister. Ambassadors outranked ministers and had precedence at official events. Legations were originally the most common form of diplomatic mission, but they fell out of favor after World War II and were upgraded to embassies.

==History==
Through the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century, most diplomatic missions were legations. An ambassador was considered the personal representative of their monarch, so only a major power that was a monarchy would send an ambassador, and only to another major power that was also a monarchy. A republic or a smaller monarchy would only send a minister and establish a legation. Because of diplomatic reciprocity, even a major monarchy would only establish a legation in a republic or a smaller monarchy. For example, in the waning years of the Second French Empire, the North German Confederation had an embassy in Paris, while Bavaria and the United States had legations.

The practice of establishing legations gradually fell from favor as the embassy became the standard form of diplomatic mission. The establishment of the French Third Republic and the continued growth of the United States meant that two of the great powers were now republics. The French Republic continued the French Empire&#x27;s practice of sending and receiving ambassadors. In 1893, the United States followed the French precedent and began sending ambassadors, upgrading its legations to embassies. The last remaining American legations, in Bulgaria and Hungary, were upgraded to embassies in 1966.

The last legations in the world were the Baltic legations, which were upgraded to embassies in 1991 after the Baltic states restored their independence from the Soviet Union, and the legations of Finland and Sweden to South Africa, which were upgraded to embassies in 1991 and 1 November 1993 respectively after the release of Nelson Mandela from prison and as apartheid and the corresponding Nordic diplomatic embargo were coming to an end.

<doc id="769204" wikidata="Q1677296" url="?curid=769204" title="Jackie Presser">
<text>Jackie Presser (August 6, 1926 – July 9, 1988) was an American labor leader and president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters from 1983 until his death in 1988. He was closely connected to organized crime, and allegedly became president of the Teamsters based on the approval and support of the Cleveland crime family. From 1972 until his death, he was also an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Mafia influence in the Teamsters union.

==Early life==
Presser was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1926. His grandfather, a Jewish emigrant from Austria, became a garment worker, and was active in and participated in several strikes led by various garment makers&#x27; unions in New York City. Presser&#x27;s father, William (Bill) Presser, was at the time of Jackie&#x27;s birth a Teamster organizer. The Pressers were very poor: Bill Presser stuffed newspapers into shoes to block holes in the uppers and strengthen worn-out soles. The family often moved into an apartment at the beginning of the month and out again at the end of the month because the Pressers could not afford the rent.

Bill Presser was however a protege of Jimmy Hoffa and quickly rose within the local, regional and international Teamsters ranks. He was elected president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters and eventually a vice president of the international union. Bill Presser was also intimately connected with the Cleveland mob.

Presser&#x27;s childhood, by his own account, was a happy one. However, he was deeply influenced by his family&#x27;s poverty and the anti-semitic prejudice he often encountered.

Presser dropped out of school in the middle of the eighth grade. Using his father&#x27;s connections, he got a job delivering jukeboxes to local restaurants and bars.

Presser enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 when he was 17, and served in World War II. After the war, Presser returned to Cleveland and got a job as a truck driver for a vending machine company.

After a year as a truck driver, Presser was hired as a union organizer by Local 10, a Cleveland affiliate of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. In 1948, Presser was elected president of Local 10. He merged his local with four other local unions in order to improve the workers&#x27; collective bargaining position. He also began receiving a markedly larger salary, and spending large amounts of money on travel and automobiles. He wore pinky rings and diamond bracelets, and became notorious for wearing loud, brightly colored sports jackets. He also began to gain substantial amounts of weight, a health problem he would fight for the rest of his life. In 1952, Presser lost re-election as union president after members became dissatisfied with his colorful and lavish lifestyle.

==Early Teamsters career==
In 1952, Jackie Presser was hired as an organizer by the international Teamsters union and held a series of staff jobs for the next 12 years. Presser&#x27;s break came in 1964, when he and his father brokered a real estate deal in suburban Cleveland for a group of local investors (which included himself). The investors built an upscale sports club and restaurant on the property secured by a $1.1 million loan from the Teamsters&#x27; Central States Pension Fund. The project went bankrupt, however, and the pension fund lost more than $265,000.

Presser also undertook a personal transformation at this time. He stopped wearing flashy rings and loud clothing and began expressing a taste for expensive, conservative, tailored suits. He also undertook a series of diets in an unsuccessful attempt to lose weight (he weighed close to 140 kg [300 pounds] for the rest of his life).

In 1966, Bill Presser gave his son Jackie a charter to form a new Teamsters local in Cleveland. Jackie Presser organized 12 workers at a local paint company and established Local 507. Presser hired a number of organizers, and Local 507 quickly organized 6,000 workers in dozens of plants and warehouses in the Cleveland area -— making Local 507 the largest Teamster local in the metropolitan area.

Bill and Jackie Presser were soon some of the most powerful men in the Teamsters union. By 1972, the father-son combination led the Ohio Conference of Teamsters. Jackie Presser quickly helped make the Ohio Conference a model within the Teamsters for providing social services, engaging in union-member communications, and undertaking effective political activity. Both Pressers were also trustees of the Teamster&#x27;s Central States Pension Fund, one of the richest and most influential pension plans in the nation.

Jackie Presser was elected an international vice president of the Teamsters in 1976. His father was forced to resign his vice presidency after he was convicted of extortion and obstruction of justice. According to court testimony, Bill Presser and the Cleveland mob agreed to nominate Jackie as Bill&#x27;s successor. Bill met with Roy Lee Williams, then president of the Central Conference of Teamsters, a regional council which controlled union locals in 14 Midwestern states, including Ohio. Williams, who was working with the Kansas City crime family, agreed to help Presser convince Teamster President Fitzsimmons to make Jackie a vice president. Jackie Presser&#x27;s subsequent election was unanimous.

As an international vice president, Presser urged the Teamsters to root out corruption and pushed for a massive public relations campaign to improve the union&#x27;s image. In 1977, the Teamsters built a large public relations operation at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. Presser soon won authorization for a $250,000-a-year advertising campaign, and the union began sponsoring football games on the radio.

However, that same year, Presser, Fitzsimmons, and 17 other Teamster leaders were forced to resign as trustees of the Central States Pension Fund. The Department of Justice had charged Presser and others with making improper loans to mob-controlled Las Vegas casinos, racetracks and real estate investments. In 1978, Presser was named a defendant in a civil suit brought by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), which sought damages and reimbursement on behalf of union retirees.

By 1979, Presser was making $231,676 a year. He drew a salary as both secretary-treasurer of Local 507 and as an international vice president of the union.

===Becoming an FBI informant===
Jackie Presser, along with his father and Teamsters President Frank Fitzsimmons, became informers for the federal government in 1972. Bill Presser had been indicted by the federal government on charges of bribery, embezzlement and other charges. Jimmy Hoffa, meanwhile, had been released from federal prison and was seeking to regain the presidency of the Teamsters. The three men offered the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) incriminating evidence about Hoffa and other rivals in the Teamsters union. The Pressers agreed to supply their evidence if the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would drop its indictment against the senior Presser. Unbeknownst to Fitzsimmons, the Pressers told the IRS that they had evidence of illegal activities by Fitzsimmons as well. The IRS was not receptive to the offers, and DOJ refused to drop its indictment of Bill Presser (some charges were eventually dropped, and Bill Presser was found innocent of others). Angry at the government&#x27;s refusal, Fitzsimmons allegedly contacted White House chief counsel Charles Colson (who was the Nixon administration&#x27;s liaison to labor groups) and sought a meeting with President Richard Nixon. Embarrassed, IRS and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents subsequently interviewed Jackie Presser in late 1972. Presser&#x27;s information was verified, and Presser spent the rest of his life as an FBI informer.

Presser began receiving $2,500 a month (roughly $12,500 in 2007 dollars) from the FBI for providing information. Presser was considered a &quot;top-echelon informant,&quot; marking him as one of the Bureau&#x27;s most prized sources.

Shortly thereafter, Presser allegedly received permission from two FBI agents to pad the Local 507 payroll with fake employees. The individuals hired as &quot;ghost employees&quot; were not required to do any work but nevertheless received substantial paychecks. The paychecks, it was later claimed, were a way of funneling payments to Teamsters officials and members of the Cleveland mob.

===Involvement with the Mafia===
According to court records, in 1974 Jackie Presser became deeply involved in Mafia affairs. He allegedly told the leaders of the Chicago crime family that he was willing to do them favors in exchange for money and assistance. Jimmy &quot;The Weasel&quot; Fratianno, a former hitman in the Cleveland crime family and later acting head of the Los Angeles crime family, later testified that Chicago crime boss Joseph Aiuppa told him in 1974 that &quot;if you need anything from Jackie Presser, he said he&#x27;ll do it for you.&quot; Fratianno also testified that he colluded with Presser to set up a union dental program whose profits were skimmed into the bank accounts of Presser and the Mafia.

Organizationally, however, Presser was under the control of the Cleveland crime family.

Presser&#x27;s involvement with organized crime eventually led to fears for his safety. In 1976, a battle for control inside the Cleveland mafia broke out. Longtime Cleveland mob boss John T. Scalish died without naming a successor. John Nardi, a high-ranking Teamster leader, formed a coalition with mobster Danny Greene to seize control of the Cleveland crime family. They were opposed by Scalish lieutenant James &quot;Blackie&quot; Licavoli. Eventually Nardi and Greene were murdered by Licavoli, along with several other Teamsters officials. Presser feared he was next. The FBI gave Presser a small radio transmitter that supposedly could detonate a car bomb from a distance. Presser also hired a large contingent of muscular bodyguards who accompanied him everywhere he went (including Teamster meetings). Despite being armed with the radio device and surrounded by guards, Presser fled to Florida and moved from hotel to hotel every few days until the gang war ended.

In 1977, Presser allegedly used his mob connections to seek political favors from President Jimmy Carter. According to Fratianno&#x27;s court testimony, Presser asked Fratianno to locate someone who could persuade Carter to put pressure on DOJ, DOL and the FBI in criminal investigations or to secure pardons for Presser associates. Fratianno claimed that William Marchiondo, an Albuquerque lawyer, later met with Presser. Marchiondo was an associate of former New Mexico Governor Jerry Apodaca, and Fratianno believed that Marchiondo and Apodaca felt they had Carter&#x27;s ear because they had supported the president&#x27;s candidacy early in the 1976 primary season.

==Reagan transition controversy==
In 1980, Ronald Reagan forged a close political relationship with Jackie Presser. During Reagan&#x27;s 1980 campaign for president, Jackie Presser served as one of Reagan&#x27;s hosts at a private luncheon for Teamster and other union leaders and escorted Reagan to private meetings with Teamster officials. After the November 1980 presidential election, Reagan named Presser as a labor advisor to his transition team. The media soon reported that Presser was reputed to have links to organized crime and that he was the object of a DOL civil suit for financial malfeasance. Reagan and his advisors claimed to have been unaware of the accusations, and Presser denied having any ties to organized crime. Just days after the story broke in the national press, however, New Jersey State Police witnesses testified that Presser was the primary contact for the DeCavalcante crime family of New Jersey and the Patriarca crime family of Boston whenever crime figures needed loans from Teamster pension funds. The courtroom testimony intensified the pressure on the Reagan transition team.

Democrats and leaders of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a Teamster reform group, demanded that Reagan remove Presser from the transition team. However, Reagan aides said that the transition team had completed its task and the issue was moot.

==Teamsters career, 1980-1983==
The U.S. Department of Labor began investigating Presser in 1981 after receiving allegations he had padded the Local 507 payroll with &quot;ghost employees.&quot; A secret affidavit outlining the government&#x27;s actions and preliminary findings was filed with a federal court in 1982.

On April 15, 1981, Frank Fitzsimmons announced he was stepping down as president of the Teamsters due to worsening health. Roy Williams and Jackie Presser were mentioned as possible successors, and some press reports indicated a fight for the presidency was under way. However, Presser announced he would not be a candidate and that he was supporting Williams instead. Williams was opposed by Pete Camarata—a dock worker from Detroit, Michigan who was the co-founder of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU). When TDU activists picketed the Teamster convention at which Williams was elected, Presser declared the picketers &quot;an ever-changing cast of union drop-outs, college students, aimless transients and an elite group of zealots who clearly have the clout over the sign carriers&quot; and declared them to be under the control of &quot;Marxist leaders from the International Socialist Party.&quot; He also repeatedly referred to Camarata as &quot;Commie-Rat-A.&quot; Camarata accused Presser of hiring a &quot;squad of thugs&quot; to intimidate delegates and provoke violence—allegations which would later prove accurate.

During the convention, Presser was asked whether he supported the reaffiliation of the union with the AFL-CIO. He told the press that his attitude was &quot;very negative&quot; toward reaffiliation.

In mid-June, Bill Presser died of a heart attack.

Jackie Presser, who was re-elected as an international vice president at the June convention, later reported that he earned $353,737 in 1981 from his various Teamsters jobs. In 1982, he made $394,895.

===First official confirmation as government informant===
Although turncoat mob leaders and others had long accused Jackie Presser of being a government informant, the first official confirmation did not come until August 22, 1981. In its August 31 issue, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Fitzsimmons, Bill Presser and Jackie Presser had all served as government informants in the early 1970s to avoid possible prosecution. The information was revealed in declassified reports filed by IRS agents. Presser confirmed that he, his father and Fitzsimmons had met with federal agents, but declared that there had been only one meeting in 1972.

Days later, the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; newspaper reported that court documents and unidentified law enforcement officials had confirmed that Presser and his father had served as government informants while taking $300,000 in kickbacks from a Las Vegas public relations firm connected to organized crime. Presser categorically denied the report.

Soon after, however, editors at the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; retracted the story despite protests from reporters. The mafia had long doubted claims that Presser was an informant, and the retraction helped renew mob confidence in Presser. The mob&#x27;s confidence in Presser was reaffirmed a year later when the Justice Department publicly ended its investigation into the alleged kickback scheme.

==Bid for presidency==
In February 1983, Presser was re-elected to the international union&#x27;s policy committee.

Just two months later, Roy Williams was convicted for conspiring to bribe U.S. Senator Howard Cannon. Williams announced he would resign as Teamsters president while appealing his conviction.

Williams&#x27; conviction was no surprise to Presser. Beginning in 1979, Presser began providing the Justice Department with extensive information on Williams. It was Presser who had turned over the critical evidence which showed Williams had arranged to give Sen. Cannon a parcel of land as a bribe to defeat trucking deregulation legislation.

Press reports at the time claimed that a ferocious fight erupted over Williams&#x27; successor. Williams&#x27; resignation came just 15 days before the Teamster convention, at which a successor would have to be elected. In addition to Presser, candidates for the presidency were reported to be M.E. &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, president of the statewide Teamsters organization in California; Joseph Morgan, president of the Teamsters in Florida; Don Peters, president of the large Teamsters local in Chicago; and Ray Schoessling, secretary-treasurer of the international Teamsters union and a Williams appointee. The press reported that Presser had formed an alliance with Anderson, which gave him enough votes to win the presidency.

In fact, no internal fight existed. Instead, mafia families in Chicago, Cleveland and various cities on the East Coast had met shortly after Williams&#x27; resignation announcement and picked Presser to lead the Teamsters. Initially, organized crime figures did not prefer Presser. But mob leaders Angelo Lonardo, Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno, and Milton &quot;Maishe&quot; Rockman (Scalish&#x27;s brother-in-law) met with mafia officials throughout the country to build support for a Presser presidency. The final decision was made at a meeting in a Chicago hotel attended by Jackie Cerone, Aiuppa, Lonardo and Rockman. Presser himself informed the FBI shortly after the mob meeting that he &quot;had the support of all the East Coast families&quot; and that he would be the next Teamsters&#x27; president.

Jackie Presser was elected president of the Teamsters on April 21, 1983. He pledged to re-invigorate the union, organize new members, and end trucking deregulation. He also said he had no opinion as to whether the Teamsters should rejoin the AFL-CIO.

Shortly after his election, Presser told his FBI contacts that anyone who sought to do business with him needed to go through the mafia first.

Presser&#x27;s biggest opponent within the Teamsters was William J. McCarthy, president of Joint Council 10, which covered all Teamster locals in New England. In an attempt to discredit McCarthy, Presser told the FBI that McCarthy had sought the support of organized crime in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Presser to appoint him secretary-treasurer in 1983.

Reports later showed that Presser was paid more than a half million dollars in salary in 1983 (the year of his election to the presidency). He received $216,000 as secretary-treasurer and executive officer of Local 507, $42,500 as vice chairman of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters, and $59,500 as president of Teamsters Joint Council 41 in Ohio. His presidential salary was $216,000 a year.

==Major presidential milestones==
On May 5, 1983, the U.S. Department of Labor settled a portion of its case against the former trustees of the Central States Pension Fund. Several insurance companies agreed to pay more than $6.75 million to the fund. Presser was not involved in the settlement, and the civil suit against him continued. But the same day DOL claimed victory against pension fund graft, Presser told FBI agents that organized crime still controlled the pension fund. In 1984, Presser and the remaining trustees settled their personal liability suit for $2 million.

Three years later, the U.S. Department of Labor settled its final civil case against Presser and the other Central States Pension Fund trustees. The agreement, which included Presser, turned operation of the pension fund over to a federal court until the year 2007. In addition, Presser and the other 17 trustees paid an additional $175,000 to reimburse the fund for certain other costs. It was the first time the Labor Department won restitution from individual pension fund trustees under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

Presser quickly established his control over the Teamsters during his first six months in office. He appointed Robert Holmes, a Detroit Teamster leader, as director of the Central Conference of Teamsters; Paul Locigno, a Teamster staffer from Ohio, as director of government affairs; Wallace Clements, a staff political coordinator in the Deep South, as political director; and Vicki Saporta, a longtime organizer, as organizing director. Presser also strengthened the union&#x27;s research and lobbying shops and established the Titan System, a computer networking system which established email communication throughout the union for the first time. He also began a major lobbying effort, particularly against a proposed labor racketeering bill.

In October 1983, the TDU announced a slate of candidates to try to oust Presser.

On November 8, 1983, Presser underwent triple bypass heart surgery in Cleveland.

By the end of 1983, Presser was making $755,474 a year.

On October 24, 1984, Presser named Weldon Mathis secretary-treasurer of the Teamsters. Mathis replaced Ray Schoessling, who retired effective January 1, 1986.

In 1984, Presser received more than $530,000 in pay. Presser was paid $224,000 in salary by Local 507, $59,500 by Teamsters Joint Council 41, $18,100 by the Ohio Conference of Teamsters, and $229,000 by the international union.

In April 1986, as Presser&#x27;s legal woes worsened, C. Sam Theodus, leader of Teamster Local 407 in Cleveland, announced he would run as the TDU candidate against Presser. Presser&#x27;s legal problems, however, seemed unlikely to harm his chances for re-election.

At the regularly scheduled Teamsters convention in May 1986, Presser was elected to a full five-year term as Teamsters president. Presser arrived in the ballroom accompanied by composer Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man, f&quot;our muscular men dressed as Roman centurions bearing him on a golden sedan chair. Despite being indicted days before on embezzlement and racketeering charges, Presser received 1,729 votes to Theodus&#x27; 24 votes. Theodus conceded after the first hour of balloting, but Presser ordered the roll call to continue to the end (it lasted another three-and-a-half hours) to humiliate Theodus. After the balloting, delegates defeated proposals to cut the president&#x27;s salary by $100,000 and to prohibit national leaders from collecting multiple union salaries.

A month later, the press reported that Presser had received a total income of $588,353 from his four union positions.

In October 1987, Presser led the Teamsters back into the AFL-CIO. Presser had repeatedly said he was uninterested in reaffiliation, and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland had been deeply angered by Presser&#x27;s attempt to merge with the ITU and to raid AFL-CIO affiliated unions with members in the publishing industry. But as Presser&#x27;s legal problems mounted and a federal takeover of the union appeared more and more likely, Presser sought reaffiliation as a means of shielding the Teamsters from the government. In August and September 1987, leaders of the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters secretly worked out a tentative reaffiliation agreement—exactly 30 years after the Teamsters were first expelled for corruption. Pushing reaffiliation on the AFL-CIO side were Robert Georgine, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers. Law enforcement officials said the reaffiliation undercut their effort to put the Teamsters under federal control.

===Attempted merger with ITU===
A month after his election, Presser proposed a merger of the Teamsters and the International Typographical Union (ITU), a 70,000-member printers&#x27; union. AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, however, opposed the merger because the Teamsters were not members of the labor federation. The Teamsters and Typographers went ahead with their merger talks anyway, even as Kirkland supported an ITU group opposed to the merger. After nearly a year, merger seemed imminent despite a lawsuit by a small group of ITU members opposing the merger. But in the election for ITU officers held just days prior to the merger vote, the incumbent ITU president Joe Bingel and executive council leadership was ousted from office and an anti-merger slate elected. The merger referendum did not pass.

Presser continued to push merger with the Typographers, even as the new ITU president Robert Mc Michen and executive council leadership signed a merger agreement with the Graphic Communications International Union (GCIU). That effort collapsed in March 1985 after ITU members rejected merger with the GCIU. Again Presser reached a merger agreement with the ITU, and once more Kirkland went on the offensive against the merger. But in August 1985, ITU members once more rejected merger with the Teamsters.

In July 1986, the ITU finally agreed to a merger with the Communications Workers of America. That merger was approved in November 1986, ending Presser&#x27;s attempt to woo the ITU. The ITU ceased to exist. The printer locals joined the CWA and the mailer locals joined the IBT.

===Second Reagan endorsement===
The Teamsters had endorsed Ronald Reagan for president in 1980, creating a furor within the American labor movement. However, AFL-CIO officials expressed hope that the Teamsters would endorse the Democratic candidate in 1984. This hope proved wrong.

Presser announced on June 7, 1983 that he intended to endorse Reagan for re-election. A formal endorsement did not come in January 1984 as expected, and Presser strongly criticized the AFL-CIO for endorsing Democratic candidate Walter Mondale too early in the primary cycle.

Worried Republicans waited throughout the spring and summer for a Teamster endorsement, but it was not forthcoming. In early August, Presser finally told White House aides that Teamster support for Reagan hinged on whether Reagan would remove Donald Dotson as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. The Dotson-led labor board had issued a string of decisions which the Teamsters considered anti-labor. On the eve of the Republican National Convention, Presser told the press that Dotson&#x27;s removal was a &quot;do-or-die situation&quot; for the Teamsters, which held more NLRB-supervised organizing elections than any other union. Reagan refused to fire Dotson, although presidential aides said that a compromise would be reached over the NLRB&#x27;s actions.

Just a week later, the Teamsters endorsed Reagan. Vice President George H. W. Bush accepted the endorsement in person. The Teamster endorsement was the only large labor union endorsement Reagan received. In apparent gratitude, Reagan named Presser to the second Reagan transition team as a labor advisor.

===Collective bargaining achievements===
Trucking: Deregulation had led to intense competition in the trucking industry, and many union trucking firms were nearing bankruptcy or were in financial difficulty. In January 1983, the employer organization which governed collective bargaining activities in the trucking industry asked the Teamsters to re-open its contract and approve significant wage reductions. Presser agreed to do both, so long as laid-off union members were given preference in re-hiring. The employers agreed. The agreement was announced on August 16, 1983. But in a surprise vote, Teamster members rejected the new wage agreement 94,086 to 13,082—easily reaching the two-thirds majority necessarily to reject a contract under the Teamster constitution. The results were a serious blow to Presser&#x27;s prestige and power in the union.

Trucking industry talks began again in January 1985. Presser pushed for limits on the use of non-union subcontractors and subsidiaries, as well as wage and pension increases. Employers pushed for the establishment of a two-tier wage scale that would set permanently lower salaries for new drivers.

Negotiators reached a new contract on April 1, 1985, as the old agreement expired. Teamsters officials initially claimed the settlement retained a single wage scale. In fact the agreement created a two-tier pay system, with new workers receiving wages 30 percent lower than incumbent drivers. The agreement also eliminated cost-of-living increases and significantly lower wages for temporary workers. The total wage and benefit package provided an increase of 10 percent over three years, the lowest increase since a national agreement had first been established in 1964. Presser and other Teamster leaders were forced to lobby hard for passage of the agreement. After a month-long ratification battle, Teamsters members narrowly ratified the contract by a 53.2 percent majority.

A third trucking industry contract was settled in May 1988. By this time, however, Presser was too ill to participate actively in any of the negotiating sessions. The new collective bargaining agreement was reached on March 30, 1988. Teamster members cast 63.5 percent of all ballots against the pact. But since the &quot;no&quot; vote did not meet the two-thirds majority required to overturn a contract and authorize a strike, Presser ordered national union officials to impose the pact.

Package delivery: The Teamsters&#x27; contract with United Parcel Service (UPS) expired on June 1, 1985. Presser sought a two-year replacement agreement that would provide a wage increase. Presser opened contract talks nearly a year early, and won a moderate wage increase. But four Teamster members sued to prevent a vote on the contract, arguing Presser had given members no time to study or debate the proposal. A federal judge agreed and impounded the ballots on September 19. Undeterred, Presser once more lobbied hard for the a new contract. A second vote was held, and 70 percent of voters approved the pact.

In 1987, Presser renegotiated the 1985 contract. This time, negotiations opened late and a new agreement not reached until two weeks after expiration of the existing pact. The tentative agreement provided a minor wage increase—only 30 cents an hour. A majority of UPS members voted against the collective bargaining agreement (35,036 for approval, 36,093 against). But since the vote fell far short of the two-thirds necessary to reject a contract, the agreement was ratified and imposed on angry workers.

Carhaul: Shortly after ratification of the UPS pact, Presser began negotiations on behalf of Teamster truck drivers who deliver new automobiles to dealerships (carhaulers). The carhaul contract expired on June 1, 1985. Presser negotiated a new agreement in mid-June which provided for a minimal wage increase of 60 cents an hour, imposed a two-tier wage system, reduced pay for trips of more than 1,100 miles, eliminated cost-of-living adjustments, and provided for only half-pay for loaded return trips. The union&#x27;s 21,000 carhaul drivers and support personnel rejected the contract by a 4-to-1 majority. Although no strike was planned, the union was forced to strike on July 26, 1985, after employers sought additional wage and benefit concessions during the subsequent round of negotiations. After a 19-day strike, a new contract was tentatively approved which offered the same wage increase. However, management agreed to remove the half-pay loaded return trip proposal. The two-tier wage system was retained, but the wage difference between incumbents and new hires was dramatically reduced. The employers also agreed to let members vote on any concessionary economic proposals during the life of the contract (under the previous agreement, only Teamster leadership voted on these changes), and were able to make permanent a temporary provision allowing companies to divert freight from terminals where there have been layoffs. But the pact&#x27;s initial rejection and the snap strike were both seen as blows to Presser&#x27;s leadership.

===Commission on Organized Crime===
In early 1985, the President&#x27;s Commission on Organized Crime issued a sealed subpoena ordering Presser to testify about mafia influence in the Teamsters union. Presser filed suit to have the subpoena thrown out. In March, a federal court refused to bar the subpoena.

The Commission held its April 1985 hearings in Chicago, and focused those sessions on organized crime involvement in labor unions. During the hearings, Commission members charged that the mafia controlled the Teamsters, the Laborers, HERE and the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association. Former mobsters described numerous syndicate cash bribes and other payments to Presser. Other witnesses testified that Presser had given his approval to the Brotherhood of Loyal Americans and Strong Teamsters (BLAST), a group set up to intimidate TDU members. Testimony before the panel indicated that Presser ordered BLAST members—including regional and local Teamster leaders and staff—to disrupt TDU meetings during the 1983 Teamster national convention. BLAST members drove speakers from podiums, tore down banners, seized and threw away literature, beat TDU members and ejected them from the convention hall. &quot;We should be doing more of that. I&#x27;m going to tell you, I&#x27;m not going to let up on these people,&quot; one witness quoted Presser.

During his own testimony, Presser invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 15 times.

Presser&#x27;s silence angered the Commission&#x27;s members. In October 1985, the Commission renewed its efforts to question Presser after it was revealed that the Department of Justice had decided not to prosecute him for padding the payroll at Local 507.

In the fall of 1985, the Commission heard testimony from former Teamsters president Roy Williams about Presser&#x27;s connections to organized crime. Under a grant of immunity, Williams testified extensively about Presser&#x27;s offer to fix a 1974 criminal case for $10,000 and his desire to obtain kickbacks for helping to arrange a 1975 Teamsters pension fund loan to organized crime figures so they could purchase a Las Vegas casino.

In March 1986, the Commission released a preliminary report on organized crime influence in the Teamsters. The Commission found corruption &quot;so pervasive&quot; that it recommended that the federal government seek court supervision of the union. Department of Justice lawyers immediately began preparing a civil lawsuit to place the Teamsters under federal control.

Presser vigorously opposed the Justice Department&#x27;s efforts. He planned a five-year legal, public relations, legislative and political counter-attack to keep the Teamsters free from court supervision, and sought and won AFL-CIO support for his proposals. He also led a massive lobbying effort in Congress to oppose the takeover on fiscal and libertarian philosophical grounds designed to appeal to Republicans.

In May 1988, federal prosecutors cut back their effort to take over the Teamsters after losing a criminal trial against Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno. Salerno and others had been accused of labor racketeering and controlling the election of Roy Williams and Jackie Presser as Teamsters president. The failure to convict Salerno led prosecutors to believe that their case against the union might be weaker than they thought. Nevertheless, an immediate trusteeship was sought to eliminate mob influence in the union.

==Final indictment and death==

The 1981 investigation into Presser&#x27;s payroll-padding at Local 507 finally led to a decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute Presser in June 1984. Five days later, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named Presser as a U.S. government criminal informant. The report quoted unnamed FBI sources, making this the first time that government officials had confirmed the unverified accusations of mob informants and other reports.

But nearly a year passed before any prosecutorial action was taken. During this time, the Justice Department debated whether to protect Presser as a source or prosecute him. Finally, on May 16, 1985, top Justice Department officials ordered federal attorneys to drop their prosecution of Presser over concerns that his extensive cooperation with the government would be revealed.

Outraged members of Congress demanded an investigation into the handling of the politically sensitive case. Over the next year, Senate investigators learned that FBI field agents had not kept FBI officials fully informed of their actions, that FBI field agents may have improperly approved illegal actions, and that FBI officials did not keep DOJ and DOL officials fully informed of their relationship with Presser.

Presser&#x27;s attorneys claimed that the FBI had given him permission to initiate and maintain the payroll-padding scheme as a means of shielding him from mob suspicions. Such permission, which is permitted under FBI and DOJ rules and federal law, should bar prosecution, Presser&#x27;s lawyers argued.

Federal grand juries in Cleveland and Washington, D.C., soon opened investigations into the FBI&#x27;s handling of the Presser case as well as whether the promises made by FBI agents had been authorized. Justice Department leaders eventually undertook a prosecution of one of the FBI field agents who handled Presser, claiming that he had not been authorized to give Presser permission to engage in the payroll-padding scheme.

In May 1986, federal prosecutors again indicted Jackie Presser for fraud.

Presser&#x27;s declining health caused numerous delays in his trial. He had surgery to remove two cancerous tumors in January 1987. His cancer returned in June 1987, and he spent several months undergoing chemotherapy and recuperating. He underwent surgery again in the fall of 1987 to remove another cancerous tumor. He suffered additional heart and pituitary gland problems throughout the winter and spring of 1988.

On May 4, 1988, Jackie Presser told the Teamsters executive board that he was taking a four-month leave of absence due to his health problems. Weldon Mathis was named the union&#x27;s acting president.

Presser was diagnosed with a brain tumor 10 days later, and underwent surgery to have the tumor removed. Presser went home, but was re-admitted to the hospital on June 27 suffering from cardiac problems, a blood clot in his lung and pituitary gland dysfunction.

Jackie Presser died in Cleveland on the evening of Saturday, July 9, 1988. He was four weeks shy of his 62nd birthday. The proximate cause of death was cardiac arrest, a complication of his cancer and ongoing cardiac problems.

Hours after Presser&#x27;s funeral on July 12, Teamster leaders met at a nearby restaurant and agreed to support William J. McCarthy as his successor.

==Other interests, personal life==
Presser and his first wife Pat had two children, a daughter Bari (born 1953) and a son, Gary. Presser divorced his second wife, Carmen, in 1983. The couple had two children. Presser&#x27;s son, Gary, was elected vice president of Local 507.

Presser was an avid golfer. He also enjoyed fine food and patronized five-star restaurants.

Presser was the first labor leader to be named to the Greater Cleveland Growth Association board of directors (the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce). He also worked with the Special Olympics and organized tournaments for blind golfers.

==Cultural references==
A 1992 made-for-TV movie was produced for HBO about his time in office, called &quot;Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story&quot;, which starred Brian Dennehy and Jeff Daniels.

<text>Corfe Mullen is a village in Dorset, England, on the north-western urban fringe of the South East Dorset conurbation. The community had a population of 10,133 at the 2011 Census. It is served by six churches, four pubs, five schools, a library, various shops and local businesses, a village hall, and many community and sports organisations. On 10 December 2019 The Corfe Mullen Parish Council resolved to adopt Town Council status, citing potential financial benefits. In all other aspects Corfe Mullen is still very much a village, albeit a large one.

The name &quot;Corfe Mullen&quot; is derived from (the Old English for a or pass) and (the Old French for a mill). The mill referred to is the old water mill on the River Stour, mentioned in the Domesday Book, where the village originally stood.

Despite the proximity of the urban area, Corfe Mullen is surrounded by Green Belt. It lies within the Dorset Heaths.

== History ==

=== Early nomadic tribes and settlers ===
The first evidence of people living in the area consists mainly of a number of flint axeheads that have been found within the village and which date from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic (Old and Middle Stone Ages). Around 3000 BC, the first real settlers came, cleared the forests and began to farm, although even they were largely nomadic. Later settlers, during the Bronze Age, built burial mounds or barrows, examples of which may be found to the east of the village at Barrow Hill and at Naked Cross at the southern end of the village. These forms of occupation continued into the Iron Age; evidence of pottery manufactured around the 1st century BC may be found at East End. Just prior to the coming of the Romans, in around 50 BC, the area was inhabited by the Belgae.

=== Romans ===
The Roman Second Legion under Vespasian arrived in the Corfe Mullen area during the fifth decade of the 1st century AD and built a fortress just to the north of the village at Lake Farm, Ashington. The location of this fortress was important; the River Stour provided a defensive barrier to the north and the site is only from the Iron Age hillfort at Badbury Rings. Lake cut this important tribal centre off from the settlements at Dudsbury and Hengistbury Head.

To subjugate the local tribes and keep themselves supplied and in communication with other Roman centres, the Legion built several roads that run through or close to the area. Probably the most important of these, and the only one visible today, is the road that connected the deep water anchorage at Morionio (now Hamworthy) and Lake (now Ashington), and continues northwards to Badbury and Hod Hill. This road forms the eastern boundary of the village. Traces of two other roads have also been found, both of which are underneath or follow the course of modern roads; one of these linked Lake with Dorchester, and is roughly aligned with the A31, the other ran through the spine of the village and followed the present road to Wareham.

Although the Roman occupation of Britain lasted nearly 400 years, the military presence at Corfe Mullen was very short lived, lasting only until the 1st century&#x27;s seventh decade. However the Roman influence continued in agriculture and industry even after they had left and the Celtic-speaking people that descended from the original tribes took over the area again.

=== Saxons ===
The Saxons probably settled in the area around the 7th century. Christianity arrived before 700 AD and open-air services are believed to have been held on the same site as the present-day old village church. During the centuries leading up to the millennium, division of land into hundreds, and tithe took place and Manorial courts dealt with disputes. The name of &quot;Corf&quot; came into usage during this period and was located in the hundred of Cogdean, with the court being held at Cogdean Elms in the north of the present village.

A number of other land holdings dating from this period have been found around the village, the most notable being at Mountain Clump and the Knoll, where the remains of cottages may be seen.

=== Norman period and Middle Ages ===
After the Norman Conquest, Corf&#x27;s entry in the Domesday Book shows that it appears to have been a single manor under &#x27;Robert, son of Gerold&#x27;, but was previously held by two Saxon lords: Waga and Egelric. At some time during the next two or three centuries, the village reverted to two manors: probably Corf Molin and Corf Hubert. The latter manor was almost certainly named after a former lord, Hubert de la Vielle. By 1469 the two manors were combined into one again, although the two names were still preserved at that time. It was probably another century before the present-day name came about. This merger was probably driven by the general depopulation of the country that occurred in the Middle Ages due to migration to the towns and the Black Death.

A third part of the village came to be known as Corfe Mullen St Nicholas. The origin of this appears to date back to a land acquisition by St Nicholas Hospital (a Salisbury charity) in 1279. The present-day areas of Lambs Green, East End and Brog Street were still called this until the early part of the 20th century.

Construction of the original parish church, then called St Nicholas but now St Hubert&#x27;s, was commenced during the 13th century, with the tower being added a little later.

=== Elizabethan to Georgian period ===

After the major changes seen after the Normans, a period of stability came to the village for about 300 years. From Elizabethan to Georgian times prosperity increased, with a number of wealthy families being the major landowners. None of these families built their homes within the parish boundaries, although the Phelipps family took over an Elizabethan Manor House (the Court House) near the church and lived there for many years. Other architectural legacies of this period are some notable farm houses, a few cottages and the original building that housed Lockyer&#x27;s Charity School, formed in 1706 by Richard Lockyer. This building is still used by the present-day Lockyer&#x27;s Middle School.

During the latter half of the 18th century, a toll road was constructed by private enterprise; Higher Blandford Road and Mill Street were part of a new route between Poole and Blandford which resulted in the people of Corfe Mullen having access to the major markets of these two towns.

=== Victorian era ===
During the reign of Queen Victoria, more toll roads were constructed, including an extension to Mill Street which provided a new route from Bere Regis to Wimborne. The railways arrived by the late 19th century, with tracks first appearing within walking distance of the village at Wimborne and later with a route that went through the village, though it was well into the 20th century before a halt was provided.

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century development accelerated. Development between the wars occurred along Higher Blandford Road and Wareham Road, with the populated area gradually extending up the hill, away from the original riverside centre at Mill Street and the older cottages at Brog Street, Lambs Green and East End.

African American troops came to stay in Corfe Mullen in around 1942, taking over big houses such as Glendon and The Towers. These included soldiers from the 1317th Engineer General Services Regiment who came to build the Tarrant Rushton aerodrome for the use of “Dakota” transport aircraft and gliders, in preparation for D-Day.

The village was known at the time as &#x27;Little Harlem&#x27;.

In the 1950s and 1960s major new housing estates were built around Phelipps Road and Hilltop Road, and in the last forty years of the century, new housing was built on most of the area between Broadstone and the eastern boundary of the village.

During the early part of the century, the village became known for its violet and lavender cultivation, which was centred around Violet Farm and Lavender Lodge (previously Corfe Lodge). Following a decline in trade, Violet Farm was demolished in the 1960s – along with a 300-year-old tithe barn – to make way for new bungalows.

=== 21st century ===
During the first decade of the 21st century, proposals were made by the South West Regional Assembly to build 800 new homes on green belt land on the edge of the village. These plans were opposed by a majority of villagers. The developments were shelved and East Dorset District Council later published more modest plans to build on the sites of the middle school or recreation ground. The adoption of any of these sites would require relocation of the school or recreational facilities. A public consultation period ended in January 2011, and the results are awaited.

== Facilities ==
Corfe Mullen is a dormitory settlement for people working in the nearby towns and cities of Wimborne, Poole, Bournemouth, Ferndown, Verwood and Southampton. It is one of the biggest villages in England. The countryside around the village is split between agriculture and heathland, with woodland to be found fringing most areas, the largest of which is Stoney Down Plantation to the west. The existence of many bridleways criss-crossing the area around the village encourages horse riding, and there are a number of stables nearby. The village also has a large recreation ground with facilities for outdoor sports, including football, cricket and tennis. This is run by the Corfe Mullen Sports Association, which is made up of volunteers from various sports clubs around Corfe Mullen. There are new allotments on Broadmoor Road that have been in use since 1 November 2019, replacing the old allotments near Lockyer&#x27;s School which are being built on.

St Hubert&#x27;s, the 13th century parish church, is a grade II* listed building.

Corfe Mullen is served by Corfe Hills School, a state secondary school, and Castle Court School, a private school for 3- to 13-year-olds, alongside three state primary schools.

=== Nature park ===
In 2016, Corfe Barrows Nature Park was opened. The nature park comprises eight natural areas, two of which lie wholly or partially within Corfe Mullen: the Happy Bottom Nature Reserve and Cogdean Elms. The remaining areas lie just over the municipal boundary within the Borough of Poole, but are easily accessible from the village.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2021 Census, the village had a population of approximately 10,400 people, with an area of 12.27 square kilometres. The village had a density of 846 people per square kilometre. The median age of the village was 47 years. The ethnic makeup of the village was 97.6% White, 0.9% Asian, 0.1% Black, 1.2% Mixed or from Multiple ethnic groups, and 0.3% from other ethnic groups. The religious composition of the village was 47.7% Christian, 45.0% No Religion, 0.4% Muslim, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Jewish, and 0.5% belonged to another religion.

<doc id="769210" wikidata="Q273640" url="?curid=769210" title="Hannah Nydahl">
<text>Hannah Nydahl (1946–2007), wife of Lama Ole Nydahl, was a Danish teacher and translator in the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Early life==
She was born and died in Copenhagen, Denmark. Hannah and her husband Ole Nydahl, who assisted her work, were childhood friends, meeting for the first time when Hannah was 5 and Ole 10.

==Involvement with Buddhism==
Under the spiritual direction of The 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje Hannah Nydahl and Ole Nydahl Founded Diamond Way Buddhism, a Buddhist organization for lay practitioners within the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. 

Hannah and Ole Nydahl were introduced to Buddhism on their honeymoon in Nepal in 1968, and were among the first Westerners to become students of the 16th Karmapa in 1969. (British nun Freda Bedi took refuge in 1960). After a three-year period of study they were sent back to Europe by the 16th Karmapa to found centers in his name.

She was a Buddhist teacher like her husband (sometimes referred to as &quot;Lamini&quot; or &quot;female Lama&quot;), but the main role of Hannah Nydahl was as a translator for Lamas like the 16th Karmapa, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche etc. In an interview she explained, &quot;I do not mind teaching but when I am together with Ole it is more natural that he teaches. When I am not with him I mainly translate and organize for the Tibetan lamas.&quot;

In the magazine &quot;Kagyu Life International&quot; she was described in this way: &quot;Hannah Nydahl is a much sought after translator and interpreter of Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. She divides her time between translating for the lamas at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi, India, participating in various Buddhist text translation projects, organizing schedules and visits of high Rinpoches in the lineage, and traveling around the world with Lama Ole.&quot;

She spoke Danish, German, English, and Tibetan fluently. As few Tibetan teachers spoke English, she learned Tibetan, from Tarab Tulku at Copenhagen University. Since all texts were in Tibetan, her work included translating texts, and spoken translation for the teaching Lamas at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi, India, participation in various Buddhist text translation projects, as well as organizing and translating lectures for Tibetan Lamas.

==Death and legacy==
In 2006 Hannah Nydahl was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and died three months later. Just a few days before Hannah passed away, the Diamond Way Buddhism Foundation purchased a 50 hectare property with historic structures in the German Alps. The Europe Center is the site of a yearly international meditation summer course where up to 4000 Buddhists from 50 countries participate in empowerments, teachings and meditations.

She was widely respected for her work, devotion and accomplishments as a Buddhist practitioner. A Danish newspaper even referred to her as the &quot;Mother of Buddhism&quot;. Jørn Borup, Department of Study of Religion at University of Aarhus said: &quot;The most lasting influence on the Buddhist practice scene in Denmark was triggered by Ole and Hannah Nydahl backpacking in the spiritual East during their honeymoon in Nepal in 1968.&quot;

A documentary about Hannah Nydahl, titled &quot;Hannah: Buddhism&#x27;s Untold Story&quot;, was screened for the first time at the ARPA International Film Festival (held at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles) on 15 September 2014 where it won the audience award for Best Documentary. The film was later screened around the world, including at various festivals where it won further awards, and has received positive reviews from film critics. It is now available on Netflix and Amazon in North America.

<doc id="769211" wikidata="Q518447" url="?curid=769211" title="Larry Pressler">
<text>Larry Lee Pressler (born March 29, 1942) is an American lawyer and politician from South Dakota who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1979, and United States Senate from 1979 to 1997, as a Republican. He remained active in politics following his failed reelection campaign in 1996 and attempted to regain his former seat in 2014 as an independent, but was unsuccessful. He has since supported Democratic tickets.

Pressler is founder and president of the Pressler Group, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, a small business to work on projects in service of veterans.

==Early life and education==
Larry Lee Pressler was born in Humboldt, South Dakota, to Loretta Claussen and Antone Lewis Pressler and was raised on his family&#x27;s farm. In 1961 he was selected as one of four 4-H members to attend the World Agricultural Fair in Cairo, Egypt. At the 1962 National 4-H Club Congress in Chicago, Illinois, he was one of two recipients of the national citizenship award and also selected to meet with President John F. Kennedy on March 4, 1963.

In 1963, he defeated Steve Byrnes with 1,014 to 909 votes and was elected as president of the University of South Dakota&#x27;s Student Association to serve until 1964. He graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1964 and was later awarded the Rhodes Scholarship. Pressler attended St. Edmund Hall at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and received a Bachelor of Arts. He returned to the United States and in 1966 completed his Master of Public Administration degree at Harvard University.

He joined the United States Army and served in the Vietnam War from 1966 until 1968. After returning from Vietnam as a first lieutenant, he served for several years in the United States Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer. He later attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and Harvard Law School where he graduated in 1971. In 1970 he became the business manager of the Harvard Law Record.

==Career==
===House of Representatives===

During the 1968 House elections Pressler considered running for the Democratic nomination for the 1st Congressional District, but chose not to run.

In 1974, he filed to run for the Republican nomination in the 1st District on the last day possible and later won it, but the South Dakota Republican Party told him that he would not be given any campaign funds. Despite the Watergate scandal hurting the Republicans nationally in the 1974 elections Pressler was one of six Republicans to gain a seat held by the Democrats.

In April 1975, he was accepted as a member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, later supported having open committee meetings for the House Republican Conference, and throughout the year he served as assistant minority leader to Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes. On April 2, 1975, he was hospitalized at the Bethesda Naval Hospital to be treated for diverticulitis and had surgery in December for it. Later in the month he cosponsored legislation to create a House select committee to reinvestigate the assassinations John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and the attempted assassination of George Wallace. On July 30, the House voted 214 to 213 to increase its salary from $42,500 to $44,600. Pressler and eight other members of the House stated that they would not keep the raise given to members of Congress.

During the 1976 Republican presidential primaries, he criticized the rivalry between President Gerald Ford and former governor Ronald Reagan which he stated would hurt moderate Republicans as both Ford and Reagan were pushing their conservative stances.

In March 1976, Jack Anderson and Les Whitten claimed that multiple articles written by Pressler had been copied in their entirety from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other newspapers. Pressler denied the charge of plagiarism, but admitted that a January 1976 article had &quot;accidentally&quot; included excerpts from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; .

After winning reelection in 1976 with almost eighty percent of the vote, Pressler stated that he was interested in running for the Senate in 1978.

====House committee assignments====

* Committee on Education and Labor
* Committee on Science and Technology

===Senate===
In 1978, he was elected to the United States Senate, succeeding retiring Democratic incumbent James Abourezk and becoming the first veteran of the Vietnam War to serve in the Senate.

He served in the Senate from 1979 to 1997 and was chairman of the Commerce Committee (1995–1997). While in the Senate, he also served on the Science and Transportation Committee, Foreign Relations Committee and European and Asian Subcommittees. Pressler ran for a fourth term in 1996 but lost by three points to Democratic Congressman Tim Johnson.
He briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, campaigning on Vietnam veterans&#x27; issues.

Pressler authored and won Congressional and Presidential approval of a sweeping reform of telecommunications legislation through the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Among Pressler&#x27;s staffers included future U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Schieffer and future state senator Neal Tapio.

====Abscam investigation====
During a sting operation conduced as part of the Abscam investigations in 1980, Pressler refused to take a bribe from undercover FBI agents and reported the bribe attempt. In a front-page story, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported:
Thanks to the FBI&#x27;s undercover &quot;sting&quot; operation, there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought. Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress, there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD) tells the undercover agents, in effect, to take their sting and stick it. Pressler, according to law enforcement sources was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors, as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs. At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.

In an overall review of the Abscam cases, Judge George C. Pratt praised Pressler, writing that, &quot;Pressler, particularly, acted as citizens have a right to expect their elected representatives to act. He showed a clear awareness of the line between proper and improper conduct, and despite his confessed need for campaign money, and despite the additional attractiveness to him of the payment offered, he nevertheless refused to cross into impropriety.&quot;

====Pakistan and the Pressler Amendment====

Pressler was also the sponsor of the Pressler Amendment, which banned most economic and military assistance to Pakistan unless the president certified on an annual basis that &quot;Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device.&quot;

===Post-Senate career===

After his defeat in the 1996 election, Pressler passed the New York bar and worked again as a lawyer. Pressler subsequently became senior partner of the law firm O&#x27;Connor and Hannan, where he served for six years, and then formed his own law firm, The Pressler Group. Pressler is a member of the New York Bar, the Washington DC Bar, and the Supreme Court Bar.

He has also lectured at more than twenty universities in China, India and the U.S., and has been granted two lifetime Fulbright teaching awards.

In 1998, Pressler considered a bid for Mayor of Washington D.C., though he ultimately would not go through with it.

During the 2000 presidential election he served on Governor George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign on its Information Technology Steering Committee, and later served on the Bush Presidential Transition Team in 2001.

Pressler attempted a political comeback in 2002 by running for South Dakota&#x27;s open at-large House seat but he essentially discontinued his campaign when Republican governor Bill Janklow unexpectedly entered the race.

Pressler was appointed an official observer of Ukraine&#x27;s national election in December 2004.

On November 10, 2009, President Obama named Pressler to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America&#x27;s Heritage Abroad. He also serves on the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.

In October 2012, based on veterans&#x27; issues, Pressler endorsed Obama for a second term with an article in The Huffington Post and on national television networks. Pressler campaigned in a bipartisan team for Obama in the fall of 2012, speaking on behalf of the Obama ticket to certain veterans’ groups in Virginia.

He taught as a distinguished visiting professor at Sciences Po University, Paris, France, and Reims, France, in the fall of 2012. He chiefly teaches international relations to graduate students.

In 2013, Pressler was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

During the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections he endorsed and voted for Barack Obama. Pressler endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

Pressler continued his public lectures including a speech at Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw, Poland, on June 4, 2018, for the 2018 International Security Forum.

In 2020, Pressler, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that Donald Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

===2014 U.S. Senate election===
The &quot;Native American Times&quot; reported in November 2013 that Pressler, at the age of 71, was weighing an independent comeback bid for the seat vacated by retiring Democratic Senator Tim Johnson in the 2014 election. After being approached by a group of citizens asking him to run, Pressler assessed his chances of victory by saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s possible but unlikely.&quot; At the conclusion of an exploratory tour of South Dakota&#x27;s 66 counties in late 2013, however, Pressler announced his candidacy and stated confidently, &quot;I intend to win.&quot; Pressler faced Republican former Governor Mike Rounds, Democratic congressional aide Rick Weiland, and independent conservative state legislator Gordon Howie in a four-way race.

Shortly before announcing his intention to run for office, Pressler explained his becoming an independent: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve moved, I think the party has moved. I feel like a man without a party. … My intent is not to hurt anyone.&quot; During his unsuccessful campaign, Pressler did not commit to caucusing with either party in the Senate if elected. He stated that he would only serve for one term, and pledged that he would &quot;never raise a dollar&quot; in campaign funds while in office.
Pressler has said that he views both parties as being &quot;too entrenched in their respective ideologies at the expense of common sense solutions.&quot;

Pressler supported raising taxes on the rich, possibly gradually increasing the retirement age for Social Security. He said that his top priority was cutting the national deficit. He also supported &quot;much, much stronger&quot; background checks for gun sales for mentally challenged persons. According to the &quot;Argus Leader&quot;, Pressler was &quot;adamantly opposed to military adventurism, supports expanding background checks on gun sales, favors restricting corporate donations to political campaigns and has called for a museum honoring Native Americans wiped out by white expansion.&quot; He had also voted for Barack Obama for president, citing &quot;fiscally conservative reasons&quot;. Pressler stated his support for same-sex marriage and filed an Amicus Curiae brief to the Supreme Court in regard to Hollingsworth v. Perry.

During the 2014 campaign, Pressler was endorsed by South Dakota&#x27;s two largest newspapers, the &quot;Sioux Falls Argus Leader&quot; and the &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot;, as well as &quot;The Daily Republic&quot; in Mitchell. The race also drew some national attention. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported, &quot;Republicans had been expected to easily win the open Senate seat in South Dakota this year, but the race has tightened recently. Earlier this month, Democrats began sending cash to the race after concluding the unusual, four-way race was winnable.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; said, &quot;A race that most had thought was safely Republican is suddenly the focus of national attention, thanks to the surprisingly successful candidacy of former Senator Larry Pressler, a Republican who is running as an independent.&quot;

Pressler ultimately lost the 2014 Senate election to Governor Rounds.

==Political positions==
===Domestic===
====Trade====

In 1975 Pressler cosponsored a bill that would prohibit the importation of beef and dairy products to improve domestic sales of those products to help farmers and he later asked President Gerald Ford to place a tariff on all imported cheese products. He later sent a letter to Vern Loen, one of Ford&#x27;s advisors, stating that Harry S. Truman&#x27;s victory in the 1948 presidential election was due to his support among farmers in swing states. He stated that in order to gain the vote of farmers that Ford should impose tariffs on dairy products while subsidizing exporting dairy products, removing most favored nation trade status for countries that have restrictions on United States beef, dairy, and pork products, and to give equal priority to agricultural products that industrial products were given at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

===Foreign===
====Foreign aid====

The House of Representatives voted 212 to 202 in favor of allotting $3.5 billion to foreign aid in the 1975 budget with Pressler voting against it stating that the United States couldn&#x27;t afford to give money to foreign countries and criticized the $1 billion given to Middle Eastern countries for weapons. On September 2, 1975, he criticized the Sinai Interim Agreement as it would have as it would give $2.8 billion to Israel, $2.3 billion to Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab states, and require the United States to send 100 technicians to observe the Israeli-Egyptian border. On April 28, 1976, he voted against a $3.2 billion foreign military aid increase as it would be given to both sides participating in the Cyprus dispute.

====Military====

On April 28, 1975, Pressler stated that American military bases in Europe should be relocated to the United States to improve the economy and due to European aggravation against the United States military presence. After President Ford gave his State of the Union Address in 1976 Pressler criticized him for not offering national defense spending cuts.

====Vietnam War====

In 1975 Pressler supported a bill to create a Missing In Action select committee to investigate the 921 cases of soldiers still missing in action from the Vietnam War.

==Personal life==

Pressler is married to Harriet Pressler. The couple has one daughter and four grandchildren. In 2015, at the age of 73, Pressler converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>Katherine Sian Moennig (; born December 29, 1977) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Shane McCutcheon on &quot;The L Word&quot; (2004–2009), as well as Jake Pratt on &quot;Young Americans&quot; (2000). Moennig played the role of Lena in the Showtime series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; from 2013 to 2019. She played a recurring role on &quot;Grown-ish&quot; on Freeform as Professor Paige Hewson in seasons 2 and 3. She reprised her role as Shane McCutcheon in &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot; in 2019. Moennig currently hosts the podcast &quot;PANTS&quot; with close friend and &quot;L Word&quot; co-star, Leisha Hailey.

==Personal life==
Moennig was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Broadway dancer Mary Zahn and violin-maker William H. Moennig III. Her father&#x27;s maternal half-sister is actress Blythe Danner, making her a half first cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Paltrow.

Moennig is a lesbian. She is married to musician Ana Rezende.

==Career==
Moennig moved to New York City at the age of 18 to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

In 1999, she had the central role in the Our Lady Peace video &quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot;. She also took a role in a Fleet Bank commercial, and appeared in a Red Cross Campaign benefiting victims of Hurricane Katrina. Moennig was a presenter at the 17th annual GLAAD awards and appeared at the 10th annual Ribbon of Hope Celebration.

Moennig&#x27;s first major role was in the television series &quot;Young Americans&quot;, playing Jake Pratt. She has played multiple lesbian roles: Shane McCutcheon in &quot;The L Word&quot;; Rosie&#x27;s (Drew Barrymore) partner Jilly in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot;; Candace, the lesbian lover of Sophia Myles&#x27; character, in &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;; and Lena, a press agent who works for Liev Schreiber&#x27;s character, in &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;. She has also pursued transgender roles, auditioning for the part of Brandon Teena in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, and playing Cheryl Avery, a young transgender woman in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Fallacy&quot;.

In April 2006, Moennig made her Off-Broadway debut as &quot;American Girl&quot;, opposite Lee Pace, in &quot;Guardians&quot; by Peter Morris. The story is loosely based on that of Lynndie England.

In 2007, the Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI) produced the documentary &quot;My Address: A Look At Gay Youth Homelessness&quot; in cooperation with Moennig. Directed by Gigi Nicolas, the documentary explored the experiences of homeless gay youth and the work of the HMI.

In 2009, Moennig joined the cast of the TV series &quot;Three Rivers&quot;. On November 30, 2009, it was announced that CBS had pulled &quot;Three Rivers&quot; from the schedule, with no plans to return it. Moennig appeared in an episode of &quot;This Just Out&quot; in 2010.

In 2013, tomboy clothing range Wildfang launched in America. Moennig was an ambassador for the brand, appearing in the launch video and designing a limited edition pair of boots.

Also in 2013, Moennig joined the cast of the Showtime drama &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;, starring as Lena, Ray Donovan&#x27;s assistant.

In 2017, Moennig narrated her first audiobook, &quot;The Late Show&quot; by Michael Connelly.

In 2019, Moennig reprised her role as Shane McCutcheon in &quot;The L Word&quot; sequel, &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot;.

Following the establishment of the State of Israel, he served as Israeli Minister Plenipotentiary in Australia (December 6, 1950 – May 9, 1952) concurrently with New Zealand, Japan (December 26, 1952 – August 1, 1957), Thailand (non-resident, 1954-1958) and Switzerland (1958-1961). In 1961 served as head of the Israeli delegation to the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities, held in Vienna. He retired from diplomatic service in 1963.

Linton was a personal friend of Israel&#x27;s first President, Chaim Weizmann, whom he had known in England. Linton disapproved of the Israeli reprisal policy against civilians in neighboring Arab countries.

Linton was a highly unusual diplomat. Not fluent in Hebrew, he wrote all his diplomatic reports in English. He was also very temperamental, which was the result of the mistrust shown towards him by his superiors in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<text>The Onondaga Limestone is a group of hard limestones and dolomites of Devonian age that forms geographic features in some areas in which it outcrops; in others, especially its Southern Ontario portion, the formation can be less prominent as a local surface feature.

In upstate New York and the Niagara peninsula of southern Ontario the sedimentary rocks tend to dip downward in a generally a South direction. The Onondaga outcrops in a line that usually forms an escarpment (the steep face of a cuesta), because of its resistance to erosion. The outcrop can be traced from the Hudson River valley westward along the southern rim of the Mohawk River valley, passing just south of Syracuse, and along the northern heads of the major Finger Lakes to Buffalo, New York. From Fort Erie, Ontario westward it runs along the north shore of Lake Erie for about 85 km and continues in a west-northwest direction inland for another ~90 km to about Ingersol and Woodstock, Ontario (as shown in the map on the right). To the west and north these rocks are known as the Amherstburg Formation of the Detroit River Group. Northwest of Ingersol and Woodstock, across the crest of the Algonquin Arch, the band of outcrop turns more northerly, and strikes north-northwest for about 140 km to the east shore of Lake Huron in the Kincardine area (as shown in the map on the right). These rocks continue northwestwards under Lake Huron, and reappear in the northern part of the southern peninsula of Michigan, north of Alpina (as shown in the map on the right). To the west, its equivalent, the Detroit River Group, outcrops near Detroit and Windsor just north of the Lake Erie shoreline (as shown in the map on the right). The Detroit River Group is not topographically distinct west of Windsor in Michigan, but is noticeable as a steep hill just northwest of Leamington.
In several spots it is breached by geologically young streams and spectacular waterfalls are formed, such as at Chittenango Falls just east of Syracuse, Buttermilk Falls at Le Roy, New York and Indian Falls west of Batavia.

A few other breaches occur in older valleys, which likely once had waterfalls, but erosion eventually obliterated them. Such breaches occur at the Tully valley, the Genesee River valley near Avon, New York, and at Port Colborne, Ontario, where the old valley forms a harbor on Lake Erie.

The formation is broken by the only major fault line in western New York, the Linden Fault just east of Batavia, where the eastern side of the fault has dropped down and the ledge moved southward relative to the western side. On the western side of the fault in Genesee County the escarpment achieves its greatest prominence. The New York State Thruway has a rock cut at Batavia which clearly shows the fault and is a popular point for geology class field trips. The fault, which runs from Attica, New York northward to Lake Ontario, is still active and periodically causes minor earthquakes in the area.

The Onondaga Limestone also can be found in other areas where rocks of the same age outcrop, such as in western Pennsylvania and Michigan but they do not form prominent geographic features.

A similar and more prominent outcrop known as the Niagara Escarpment runs parallel and about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the north through upstate New York, and similarly curves northwestward in southern Ontario toward Lake Huron and eventually into Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula and Wisconsin&#x27;s Door Peninsula.

Another smaller outcrop known as the Portage Escarpment lies about to the south, running along the southern ends of the Finger Lakes and forming Cascadilla, Ithaca and Buttermilk Falls in Ithaca.

The Onondaga Escarpment contains significant outcrops of flint (a type of chert) which bears the escarpment&#x27;s name. This variety of chert was of great importance to First Nations peoples throughout Southern Ontario, who used it to make stone tools (lithics) such as projectile points and hide scrapers. This variety of chert, which is of reasonably high-quality and which was highly valued by First Nations peoples, is often a common variety of chert recovered archaeologically from sites relatively adjacent to outcrops; for example, Onondaga-variety chert comprises 95% of all of the flint material from some sites in Milton, Ontario. The material has also been found as well at some distance from its original source; Onondaga chert has been recovered at the late archaic Duck Lake archaeological site in northern Michigan, circa 400 kilometers from the nearest outcropping of the material. This wide distribution implies either a very large seasonal migration of ancient peoples or long-distance trade routes, with both likely being the case at different times throughout the prehistory of the Great Lakes region.

== Description ==

The Onondaga Limestone is composed of four main subunits. In descending order:
* Seneca Member
* Moorehouse Member
* Nedrow Member
* Edgecliff Member
The Seneca and Moorehouse members are sharply divided by the Tioga-B Bentonite layer, which was formed in a very short time period as the result of a large volcanic eruption in what is now the state of Virginia.

Relative age dating of the Onondaga places its formation in the Eifelian to Givetian stage of the Middle Devonian period, or 391.9 to 383.7 Ma. Radiometric dating of a sample from the bentonite at the top of the Onondaga placed it at 390 ± 0.5 Ma. The formation is time equivalent with the Floresta Formation of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Colombia.

== Onondaga limestone dimension stone ==
Onondaga limestone was quarried as dimension stone for construction of limestone buildings.

The following buildings contain structural Onondaga limestone:
* Brooklyn Bridge (cable anchorages and towers below the water line) in Brooklyn, New York
* Genesee County Courthouse in Batavia, New York
* Gridley Building of Syracuse, New York
* Hall of Languages, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York
* White Memorial Building, Syracuse, New York

<text>James Patton Preston (June 21, 1774May 4, 1843) was a U.S. political figure who served as the 20th Governor of Virginia.

==Biography==
James Patton Preston was born at Smithfield Plantation, in what is now Blacksburg, Virginia. He attended the College of William and Mary from 1790 to 1795 and managed his family&#x27;s vast estate, which included the land that is now the campus of Virginia Tech and large portions of its college farm. The 7,500-acre (30 km²) tract previously known as Draper&#x27;s Meadow was granted sometime before 1737 by Governor Robert Dinwiddie to Preston&#x27;s great uncle and namesake, Colonel James Patton, an Irish sea captain turned land speculator who had died in the Draper&#x27;s Meadow Massacre. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he served for four years the Virginia State Senate, and two years in the Virginia House of Delegates.

He joined the United States Army for the War of 1812, serving as lieutenant colonel and second in command of the 12th Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to colonel of the 23rd Infantry Regiment in August 1813 and served until being seriously wounded at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm in Ontario.

After the war, Preston returned to the House of Delegates. He served as the 20th Governor of Virginia from 1816 to 1819. His term was marked by the state&#x27;s payment of more than $1.5 million in debt incurred to cover expenses during the War of 1812 and the establishment of the University of Virginia.

After leaving office, Preston served as Postmaster of Richmond before retiring to his estate.

He died at Smithfield Plantation on May 4, 1843, and is buried in the estate&#x27;s cemetery.

Preston County, Virginia (now West Virginia) was formed in 1818 and named in his honor. Also named for him is a residence hall at William and Mary.

==Family==
His father was Colonel William Preston, and his mother was Susanna Smith (1739–1823).

Preston married Ann Taylor (1778–1861), with whom he had three children, William Ballard, Robert Taylor, and James Francis. Their son William Ballard Preston served as a Member of the United States House of Representatives and United States Secretary of the Navy. During the American Civil War, William B. Preston was a Senator in the Congress of the Confederate States. 

Sons Robert Taylor Preston and James Francis Preston both served as officers in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

James Patton Preston was the brother-in-law of John Floyd and the uncle of James McDowell and John Buchanan Floyd.

After Richard Strauss assigned the role of the Empress in his &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; to her at the Dresden Opera in 1919, she went on to perform as Verdi&#x27;s Aida at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and La Scala in Milan, among others. She returned to Dresden often, including to appear in title role of &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot; in the world premiere. 

== Life and career ==
=== Early years ===

Lisbeth Sättler was born in Schwarzenberg. Her father was a teacher, and supplied her first musical education. She studied piano and voice at the Dresden Royal Conservatory from age 16 with Otto Watrin. She made her operatic debut in Dresden opposite Richard Tauber on 16 June 1915, as Arsena in the operetta &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot; by Johann Strauss. In 1916 she performed leading roles such as the Countess Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Figaro&quot;, Eva in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. In 1919, Richard Strauss entrusted her to perform the role of the Empress in his &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, she was so successful that he wanted to engage her at the Vienna State Opera. She was then recognised internationally, and appeared at major operas houses in Europe.

== Metropolitan Opera ==
Rethberg sang with the Dresden Opera until 1922, when she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera (Met) as Verdi&#x27;s Aida. She moved to the US and remained with the Metropolitan Opera for 20 seasons, singing 30 roles. She studied further with Estelle Liebling in New York City. Her four Met opening nights (Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Mozarts &quot;Figaro&quot; and two times &quot;Aida&quot;) tie her with Licia Albanese as the soprano awarded the most Met opening nights. She also was engaged by London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, where she sang in 1925 and from 1934–1939.

=== Other international performances ===
She appeared at the Salzburg Festival in Austria, to audiences at La Scala in Milan, where she performed again as Aida, conducted by Toscanini, and elsewhere in Europe.
Rethberg often returned to Dresden. In 1928, she created the title role in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot;, conducted by Fritz Busch. During the latter half of the 1930s, Rethberg&#x27;s voice lost some of its luster, which some attribute to her frequent singing of Aida and other heavier roles. She retired from the stage in 1942.

=== Personal life ===
Rethberg was first married to Ernst Albert Dormann. In 1956, she married the Russian-born Met comprimario singer George Cehanovsky.

Rethberg died in Yorktown Heights at age 81 

== Recordings ==

Rethberg made recordings of arias and ensemble pieces in Germany and the United States between 1921 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Many of these are available on LP and CD transfers.* 

The most notable records of her art include live Metropolitan Opera recordings of her role in the complete operas, including &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Concerning her lieder discography, she was included in the 1930s Hugo Wolf Society recording project (e.g. &quot;Müh&#x27;voll komm&#x27; ich und beladen&quot;).

Rethberg had a distinctive lyrical but focused voice felt to be at once extremely feminine and penetrating. She is heard in live recordings later in her career of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; opposite Lauritz Melchior, &quot;Otello&quot; opposite Giovanni Martinelli and Lawrence Tibbett, and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, again with Martinelli and Tibbett. Only a few measures exist of her Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; opposite Martinelli and Richard Bonelli. While no full recordings exist of her most famous role, Aida, she recorded many extracts from it in the studio. A combination of live performances and studio recordings remain of her rendition of Amelia from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot;, that possibly best illustrate the combined lyric and dramatic potential of her voice.

<doc id="769227" wikidata="Q16258947" url="?curid=769227" title="Beamter">
<text>The German civil servants called (men, singular &#x27;, more commonly&#x27;) (women, singular &#x27;) have a privileged legal status compared to other German public employees (called&#x27;), who are generally subject to the same laws and regulations as employees in the private sector. For example, the state can only fire &quot;Beamte&quot; if they commit a felony.

The tradition of classifying only some public employees as dates back to the &quot;enlightened rule&quot; of monarchs practised in 18th-century Prussia and other German states. These states did not accept &quot;radical&quot; concepts such as democracy or popular sovereignty, but they did try to professionalise their public services and to reduce corruption and favouritism. The idea was that whoever represents the state by undertaking official duties which only the state may legally provide (&#x27;), such as issuing official documents, teaching state-approved curricula to students, preaching in state-approved churches, or making any other kind of official decisions, should have a special legal status and relationship with the state that demands a higher than normal degree of loyalty. At its core, that loyalty is regarded as mutual, with having a special duty of service (&#x27;) going beyond the duties of salaried workers, with the state having a special duty of seeing to their welfare (&#x27;) that likewise goes beyond what would be expected of a commercial employer. Some people believe that once&#x27; (i.e. tenure for life as a civil servant) is conferred, civil servants lack further professional motivation, to the detriment of those they are appointed to serve.

While soldiers and judges are not considered in Germany, many of the same rules apply to them. However, unlike , judges are not subject to the usual hierarchy and order of command of government, in order to preserve judicial independence. Similarly, unlike , soldiers cannot be ordered to act in any manner unrelated to the defence of the state (with the exception of providing peaceful aid in specific emergency situations laid down by law), so as to preserve the civilian nature of the German government.

==Privileges and restrictions==
Under Art. 33(5) of the Basic Law, appointment as a is for life and subject to public law, not private-law employment regulations. There is no contract of employment between the and the state entity employing him. possess a range of privileges. These include: 
* a special health plan, the &quot;&quot;, which covers 50% of most health care expenses for the , their spouse, and dependent children, with the being responsible for the remainder of the cover (usually achieved by taking out private health insurance);
* an index-linked pension of at most 71.75% of final salary, paid directly by the state rather than by the usual public pension provider (unlike those who receive a normal pension, must pay income tax on the entirety of their pension income);
* exemption from all social security contributions, although they are, like all other employees, subject to income tax;
* near-ironclad job security – the state may transfer who do not perform well to other, often less desirable (but not less paid), posts, but can only terminate their employment entirely in cases of serious felonies.

There are also a number of restrictions on :
* unlike all other public or private employees, they have no right to strike
* their salary and working hours are determined by law, rather than by negotiations between employers and unions. As a result, the usual working week for ordinary public employees is 38.5 hours, whereas for it is now between 40 and 42 hours, depending on the entity employing the .
* if they opt in to Germany&#x27;s public health insurance services, they face tight restrictions, must cover both the employee&#x27;s and the employer&#x27;s contributions, and cannot include their spouses or dependent children;
* if they resign from their post, they receive only the very low basic unemployment benefits, not the unemployment insurance benefits, since they do not pay unemployment insurance;
* if they are removed from active duty due to misconduct, they lose not only their salary, but also all retirement benefits (&quot;pension&quot;) and have no coverage of health-care costs because they never have been insured;
* who commit a crime – whether on or off duty – face double punishment, since they are subject to both the criminal law and internal disciplinary procedures.
* can be punished for accepting benefits that are linked to their official role or function and that are provided by third parties. This punishment for receiving an advantage through the position is reaching much further than the prosecution for bribery because in contrast to bribery no favour has to be granted in return.
* have fewer rights to engage in political work.

Entities that may employ include the federal government, the 16 state governments and all local authorities, certain corporations, agencies and foundations governed by public law, such as the Catholic and Lutheran churches, whose priests have a status similar to that of . These are not, however, employed by the state but by the churches in their capacity as corporations of public law.

==Becoming a ==
A prospective must be a national of the Federal Republic of Germany or of a member state of the European Union (although there are now multiple exceptions), and must generally achieve the status by the age of 35. There are four professional career tracks for , depending on their education:
* &quot; (simple or lower service), mainly for positions of menial work, which has mostly fallen out of use. Similar to enlisted ranks excluding non-commissioned officers.
* &quot; (middle service), mainly for positions requiring roughly the equivalent of a completed apprenticeship. Similar to non-commissioned officers.
* &quot; (upper service), mainly for positions requiring a bachelor&#x27;s degree or its equivalent. This bachelor&#x27;s degree is often obtained whilst studying at a public institute of higher education provided, and working as a trainee . Similar to company grade or junior field grade officer (who however in many cases obtain a master&#x27;s degree before taking up a troop post).
* &quot; (senior service), restricted to graduates holding a master&#x27;s degree or its equivalent. Similar to military officers of rank major and above, and to all judges.

Transition from a lower to a more senior career track is possible (so-called &quot;Laufbahnaufstieg&quot;, &quot;career track enhancement&quot;).

Teachers of primary and II and III class secondary schools have a position unofficially between upper and senior service (to which latter the I class secondary school teachers belong, as they begin their service in the highest pay grade of upper service and can by promotion reach senior service (yet in the case of primary teachers, promotion is practically restricted to the principal).

Conferral of the status of does not involve any contract, but formal letters of appointment (&#x27;). The new first task is to swear his oath of office, including a pledge to uphold and protect the federal laws and the constitution (&#x27;), and – where the employing entity is not the federal government – the constitution and laws of the respective state. Additionally, new Beamte have to table a medical supervision screening in order to prove their physical (and to some extent psychological) ability to serve in this type of fixed, decades-long career. Furthermore, they are subject to a prior screening by the police and judiciary - in order to exclude perpetrators, extremists, and false play.

There are typically three steps involved in becoming a with full tenure for life:
# For all four career tracks (lower, middle, upper and senior civil service) there are specially-designed training schemes lasting one year (lower service), two years (middle service) or three years (senior and upper service), including oral and written exams as well as a dissertation. There are exceptions for highly technical tasks. Trainee usually have the title &#x27;, preceded by the official term of the position, e.g. &#x27; (Trainee Government Secretary) or &#x27; (Trainee Detective Inspector). Trainee officials of the senior service are called &#x27;, e.g. &quot;&quot; for a trainee teacher. They receive a special salary and hold the legal status of , albeit without tenure for life.
# The trainee period is followed by a probationary period. This period usually lasts three years, occasionally longer. The salary is based on the salary grade which the will hold upon achieving tenure for life. Usually, the designation of office precedes the abbreviation &quot;z. A.&quot; (&#x27;), which means &quot;to be employed&quot;, e.g. &#x27; Again, there is an exception with regard to the senior service, where probationary may be called &#x27; (e.g. &quot;Studienrat z. A., &quot;), or, alternatively, &#x27;, although this is now less common. 
# The official becomes a &quot;&quot;, i.e. a with full tenure for life. 
It should be borne in mind that, whether applicants undergo steps 1, 2, or 3, they are already hold the status of , although initially in training or on probation. It is also important to know, that normally it is impossible to become a after the age of 45.

==Fields of work==
The status of Beamter is held by administrative officials, but also by policemen, prison guards, customs officers, most teachers and university professors, and other professionals in the public service, and by certain holders of political offices such as mayors (but not ministers, who have a peculiar, but similar, status governed by public law). For holders of political office, the status of Beamter is not permanent, only applying during the term of office. Furthermore, while most teachers in the Western states of Germany are Beamte, this is not necessarily the case in Eastern states. Berlin, for example, abolished the status of Beamter for teachers in 2005, but reintroduced it in 2023.

Formerly, Beamter status used to be bestowed more liberally. As it results in permanent tenure, there are still many Beamte amongst those working for the German post office (Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telekom), the railway services (Deutsche Bahn), and other public utility companies, many of which are either no longer state-owned or have been converted into companies governed by private rather than public law. New employees at those entities are no longer made Beamte. Privatisation and reductions in the number of established posts have reduced the overall number of Beamte. Since 1991, the number of Beamte has declined by 1.4 million to around 3.9 million. This meant that, as of January 2007, reunited Germany had fewer Beamte than the old Federal Republic of Germany.

Local authority staff is split: about one-third are Beamte, mostly in higher administrative positions, and two-thirds are ordinary employees.

==Income==
All Beamte were once paid according to the Bundesbesoldungsgesetz (Federal Payment Act), regardless of who the employing entity was (the federal government, the 16 states, local authorities or other corporations, agencies and foundations governed by public law). This has now changed. The 16 states have the option to vary salaries. Nonetheless, the Federal Government still keeps a close eye on the respective &quot;Landesbesoldungsgesetze&quot;, which may only differ up to 5% from the Federal Salary Scheme.

In Germany, Beamte have permanent tenure, i.e. they cannot normally be dismissed, receive certain privileges, and are usually remunerated more generously than ordinary employees. In addition, they are exempt from all social security contributions such as pension or unemployment insurance. Dismissal is permissible for prolonged periods of illness, i.e. three months within half a year, but in this case, the Beamter can only be retired if he is not able to go back to work within the next six months. It is also possible to &quot;dismiss&quot; the Beamter during the probationary period, and thereafter the Beamter can be retired and given a pension on the basis of his years of service.

In the new &quot;Länder&quot; which once constituted the German Democratic Republic, most teachers are not Beamte, with the possible exception of head teachers and certain specialists (lecturers teaching at schools providing vocational education or at grammar schools).

Salary is usually counted by month (as opposed to the anglophone, or also German tax law, custom to count it by year). Apart from the salary group, it also depends (in orders A, R and C) on the number of years served. Bypassing additions (for family or special positions, etc.) and variations in sub-federal law, the monthly salary for the lowest possible order (A2) is €1845.90, that for a beginning detective (A9) is €2441.26, that for a beginning Gymnasium teacher (A13) or state attorney or local judge (R1) is in either case €3780.31, that of a Gymnasium principal (A16) at the end of his career may be up to 6649.87 and that of a State Secretary is €12508.46. For more details, see the salary calculator in the weblinks below.

Beamte only pay income tax but do not pay social insurance contributions. Their salary is considered an alimentation that comprises the reimbursement of health care costs and continues at a lower level during retirement. As appointment is considered life-long no unemployment insurance is paid. This means that their income after tax is much higher than that of other civil servants or workers in private companies with a comparable gross salary.

==Designations of office==
In the German civil service (regardless of whether concerning the federal government, the 16 states or other entities), the official title of designation held by the Beamter is tied to one of the salary grades of the Federal Payment Act, on which the individual states base their own remuneration legislation.

The following lists are very generalised, especially in order &quot;B&quot; Beamte tend to have very specialised titles; thus, mayors, ambassadors, lords-lieutenant of districts and provinces will be fitted in somewhere depending on the importance of their office. For information&#x27;s sake, judges and federal ministers who are &quot;not&quot; Beamte are included (Staatsanwälte are, though). In the table, the same thing has been done to the general military ranks (without notice of naval ranks and other deviations).

Overview

There are also colonels in B3 paygrade. The paygrade of a brigadier general is B6, that of a major general B7, that of a lieutenant general B9 and that of a full general B10.

Secondary Employments

Due to the exclusive and intense mutual relationship between state institution and Beamter, possibilities for engaging into secondary employments are strictly regulated by the basic laws governing Beamte. In general these are limited to few hours per week and additional income beyond a very low threshold has to be delivered to the state. Exceptions are only made for academic professors (W2-W3 and C3-C4) where provisions are made especially for those who represent &quot;free professions&quot; like medicine, certain legal professions and pharmacists. Beamte who are Professors of Clinical Medicine usually have treatment privileges at the respective university hospitals in most states.

&quot;Ich schwöre, das Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland und alle in der Bundesrepublik geltenden Gesetze zu wahren und meine Amtspflichten gewissenhaft zu erfüllen.&quot;The oath can be sworn both with or without the religious annotation: &quot;So wahr mir Gott helfe&quot; at the end.

* English translation:
&quot;I swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and all laws valid in the Federal Republic and to fulfil my official duties conscientiously. [So help me God].&quot;

==Beamte, Richter and Soldaten==
Although officially not having the status of Beamte, Richter (&quot;judges&quot;) and Soldaten (&quot;soldiers&quot; for a fixed term of two years above; this does not include [former] conscripts and volunteers of up to 23 months) have similar rights and duties to Beamte. For one thing, they are also paid according to the Bundesbesoldungsgesetz; soldiers according to Orders A and B, and judges according to Order R, as are public prosecutors. The latter are, nevertheless, Beamte; soldiers and judges are not. Furthermore, they practically cannot be dismissed, and have the same income. Soldiers and judges are also expected to swear an oath on the Constitution.

Judges are not Beamte, although they were until the mid-1950s. Until then, judges were also paid according to Order A, and usually had the titles &quot;Justiz-&quot; or &quot;Gerichtsrat&quot;. However, officials represent the executive branch of government, while judges are independent of the government. Beamte have a duty to obey direct orders from a superior, which is incompatible with an independent system of justice.

==Public image of Beamten==
Beamte suffer from an image problem in Germany. A study conducted by the German Civil Service Federation (DBB) concluded that 61% of the German population thought Beamte to be &quot;lazy, lethargic, inflexible, stubborn or corrupt&quot;. Other common points of contention, among the German public, are that Beamte are paid excessive salaries and cannot be removed from their positions for any reason other than engaging in serious criminal conduct or being incapacitated.

==The Bundesbesoldungsgesetz==
There are several different Salary Orders (Besoldungsordnungen): A (for most Beamte and soldiers), B (for ministerial officials), C (for university professors and lecturers; now replaced by W for newly employed lecturers), R (for public prosecutors and all judges) and W for university lecturers and professors.
The salaries in order A are organised in steps, i.e. the longer a Beamter has worked, the better he or she is paid. The different groups reach from A2 to A 16 (A1 was abolished in the 1970s). A2 to A5/6 belong to the Lower Service, A 6 to A 9 to the Middle Service, A 9 to A 13 to the Upper Service and A 13 to A 16 to the Senior Service. The other orders, B, C, R and W, also belong to the Senior Service. German law refers to this as the principle of career tracks or Laufbahnprinzip, based on academic qualifications. 
* Beamte of the Middle Service are required to have passed their Realschulabschluss, preferably some further experience. This can be compared to GCSEs in the United Kingdom (other than Scotland), or the American High School diploma. 
* To join the Upper Service, all applicants need the Abitur (roughly equivalent to A-levels in UK schools), followed by taking a degree at a college owned by entity for the purpose of training future Beamte. 
* Traditionally, most Beamte in the Senior Service held a University State Exam, then equivalent to a university diploma or magister, at a time when law and teacher training was still regulated by the state (law still is). However, the common requirement these days is a master&#x27;s degree or equivalent, or a State Exam in law. Grammar-school teachers now commonly hold a B.A. in two or three subjects, and a Master&#x27;s in Education. In Baden-Württemberg, the annual starting salary for a single teacher without children (A13) is €45,511.92 pre-tax (c. £38,500; US$58,600).
* Top salaries can be as high as € 180,897.60 (B11) also considering that the top positions in the system is alimented on this level using a multplicator of 1 5/6. During retirement the alimentation continues at up to 71.75% of the salary that was received in the two years before retirement. 

==Beamte in other countries and in the European Union public authorities==
Although a common translation for Beamter is &quot;Civil Servant&quot;, there are major differences from the British Civil Service, which refers to employees within government departments and not, for example, teachers or postmen. A better translation is &quot;public servant&quot;, being permanently employed within the public sector.

Another country whose entire administrative structure is based on an officialdom comparable to that of Germany is Austria, where Beamte even often have the same titles, e.g. &quot;Rat&quot; (&quot;councillor&quot; or &quot;counsellor&quot;). Most cantons and the federal government of Switzerland have abolished their officialdom. France and the Netherlands are also countries traditionally administered by Beamte.

<text>Lewis Thompson Preston (August 5, 1926 – May 4, 1995) was an American banker. He was President of the World Bank from September 1991 until his death in May 1995.

==Life and career==
Born New York City, Preston was the son of Lewis T. and Priscilla Baldwin Preston. His father was a World War I flier and a well-known hunter. His grandfather was a partner in Standard Oil. Part of his youth was spent living in Paris. He served in the US Marines during World War II in the Pacific and as an aide to Navy Secretary James Forrestal who was a friend of his mother. He graduated from Harvard University with a degree in history in 1951, and was at one point during his education the captain of Harvard&#x27;s hockey team. He was chosen for the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, but never ended up competing in the Olympics.

Preston worked at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and its subsidiary Morgan Guaranty Trust Company for forty years. His first major contribution to the company was in the mid-1960s when he convinced the company to use trade in the newly formed Eurodollar market as source of liquidity; a move which greatly improved the prosperity of the company. In 1968 he was appointed vice president in charge of international banking, and under his tenure over half of the company&#x27;s earnings came from the international banking sector in the 1970s. After eight years in that position he became vice chairman of the board of directors in 1976, and then president of the board in 1978.

In 1980 Preston was appointed CEO of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. He helped the company weather the storm of Silver Thursday in 1980 which had a wide negative impact on the banking industry. In 1984 he assisted in the bailout of Continental Illinois when it was seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He retired as CEO in February 1991. From September 1991 until his death in Washington D.C. on May 4, 1995, he was President of the World Bank.

==Personal life==
He was the second husband of Patsy Pulitzer.

<text>William Ballard Preston (November 25, 1805 – November 16, 1862) was an American politician who served as a Confederate States Senator from Virginia from February 18, 1862, until his death in November. He previously served as the 19th United States Secretary of the Navy from 1849 to 1850. He is also the cousin of William Campbell Preston and William Preston.

==Biography==

Born in 1805 at Smithfield Plantation in Blacksburg, Virginia, William Ballard Preston entered Hampden–Sydney College in 1821, where he was active in literary and forensic activities. Graduating in 1824, Preston studied law at the University of Virginia and was admitted to the bar in 1826. In 1831 he became the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Floyd County, Virginia. He married Lucinda Redd of Henry County, Virginia.

The young attorney soon entered politics as a Whig and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1830. During the 1831–1832 session, he took an active part in the campaign to abolish slavery. Then there followed an eight-year hiatus in his political activities during which he returned to the practice of law. In 1840, he was elected to the State Senate, where he served from 1840 to 1844, before returning to the House of Delegates. In 1846, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives.

In March 1849, President Zachary Taylor appointed the Preston Secretary of the Navy. During Preston&#x27;s tenure in that office, the United States Navy acquired new duties in the course of America&#x27;s westward expansion and acquisition of California. Trade and commerce in the Pacific Ocean beckoned, and the Stars and Stripes flew from the masts of Navy ships in Chinese waters, while the shores of Japan, then unopened to the west, presented a tantalizing possibility for commercial intercourse. The Navy also was progressing through a technological transition, especially in the area of moving from sails to steam propulsion, and with the improvements in gunnery and naval ordnance. Upon the death of President Taylor, new President Millard Fillmore reorganized the Cabinet and appointed William Alexander Graham Secretary of the Navy. Preston retired from office and withdrew from politics and public life.

Resuming his private law practice, Preston acquired a reputation for being a fine defense lawyer before being sent to France in 1858 to negotiate for the establishment of a line of commercial steamers to operate between Le Havre and Norfolk. The mission to France progressed well, and the project appeared promising until it was brought to naught by the American Civil War.

As states in the lower South seceded from the Union, the pressure mounted upon Virginia to do likewise. Moderate sentiment still held sway through 1860; but, early in 1861, increasing tensions forced Virginians to consider secession. On February 13, 1861, the secession convention met in Richmond and numbered William B. Preston amongst the delegates. As the Confederacy was established and the United States divided into two hostile camps, both sides moved steadily toward open conflict. A special delegation, composed of William B. Preston, Alexander H.H. Stuart, and George W. Randolph, traveled to Washington, D.C. where they met President Abraham Lincoln on April 12. Finding the President firm in his resolve to hold the Federal forts in the South, the three men returned to Richmond on April 15. With the news of the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12, 1861, conservative and moderate strength in the secessionist convention melted away. On April 16, convinced that secession was inevitable, William B. Preston submitted, in secret session, an ordinance of secession. Supported 88 to 55, the Preston Resolution passed, and Virginia left the Union.

Elected C.S. Senator from Virginia in the Confederate States Congress, he served in that legislative body until his death at Smithfield Plantation in 1862. He is interred at the Preston Cemetery in Blacksburg, Virginia, near Smithfield Plantation.

==Legacy==
USS &quot;William B. Preston&quot; (DD-344) was named after him.

<text>Soyuz TMA-1, also catalogued as Soyuz TM-35, was a 2002 Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched by a Soyuz FG launch vehicle with a Russian-Belgian cosmonaut crew blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. This was the fifth Russian Soyuz spacecraft to fly to the ISS. It was also the first flight of the TMA-class Soyuz spacecraft. Soyuz TM-34 was the last of the prior Soyuz-TM spacecraft to be launched.

==Mission highlights==
In the spring of 2001, a taxi mission to the space station was being scheduled to take place in October 2002. At first the crew was to be commander Sergei Zalyotin and flight engineer Frank De Winne; however, a report released in February 2002 stated that American musician Lance Bass was interested in joining the crew for a one-week mission on board the Russian spacecraft. The mission began to fall through, and by September 2002 they had discontinued the training of Lance Bass due to the mission organizers&#x27; failure to meet the terms of the contract. They filled the vacant seat left by Lance Bass with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Lonchakov.

While the Soyuz TMA-1 was on orbit, the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred and required a change in crew changeout process. The Soyuz system became the sole method for crew to launch to and return from the ISS until the space shuttle was returned to service in July 2005.

Soyuz TMA-1 disembarked from ISS on May 4, 2003 and immediately began its return to Earth, marking the first entry and descent for this Soyuz class. A technical malfunction caused the Soyuz control system to abandon the gentler controlled entry and descent and instead fall back to the harsher ballistic reentry and descent. This resulted in a steep and off target landing of the spacecraft. The craft landed 300 miles short of the planned area, and the crew was subjected to severe acceleration loads. Communication with the Soyuz was lost because one antenna was ripped off during descent, and two more did not deploy. The crew regained communications through an emergency transmitter after landing. Due to this event, future crews would be provided with a satellite phone to establish contact with recovery forces.

Subsequent Soyuz TMA missions were able to successfully execute controlled reentries until the Soyuz TMA-10 and Soyuz TMA-11 missions which both also reverted to ballistic descents.

Don Pettit, concerned that the film documenting his science experiments on the ISS would be damaged by space radiation before the next Shuttle could bring it home, decided to secure the film and other items in a pack he placed on his chest during reentry. While a normal Soyuz entry involves 3 G&#x27;s, the ballistic reentry subjecting the crew to over 8 G&#x27;s. This extreme force made the pack feel like a weight pressing down on Pettit&#x27;s chest. Pettit was left exhausted and reportedly dislocated a shoulder, but the space agencies downplayed the situation saying the astronauts were in good shape.

<text>Eugène Marcel Prévost (1 May 18628 April 1941) was a French author and dramatist.

==Biography==

Prévost was born in Paris on 1 May 1862, and educated at Jesuit schools in Bordeaux and Paris, entering the École polytechnique in 1882. He published a story in the &quot;Le Clairon&quot; as early as 1881, but for some years after the completion of his studies he applied his technical knowledge to the manufacture of tobacco.

He published in succession, &quot;Le Scorpion&quot; (1887), &quot;Chonchette&quot; (1888), &quot;Mademoiselle Jaufre&quot; (1889), &quot;Cousine Laura&quot; (1890), &quot;La Confession d&#x27;un amant&quot; (1891), &quot;Lettres de femmes&quot; (1892), &quot;L&#x27;Automne d&#x27;une femme&quot; (1893), and in 1894 he made a great sensation by a study of the results of Parisian education and Parisian society on young girls, &quot;Les Demi-vierges&quot;, which was dramatized and produced with great success at the Gymnase on 21 May 1895. &quot;Le Jardin secret&quot; appeared in 1897; and in 1900 &quot;Les Vierges fortes&quot;, and a study of the question of women&#x27;s education and independence in two novels &quot;Frédérique&quot; and &quot;Léa&quot;.

&quot;L&#x27;Heureux ménage&quot; (1901), &quot;Les Lettres à Françoise&quot; (1902), &quot;La Princesse d&#x27;Erminge&quot; (1904), and &quot;L&#x27;Accordeur aveugle&quot; (1905) are among his later novels. A picture of modern German manners is given in his &quot;Monsieur et Madame Moloch&quot; (1906). He had a great success in 1904 with a four-act play &quot;La Plus faible&quot;, produced at the Comédie-Française.

Prévost was elected to the Académie française in 1909.

He died on 8 April 1941, aged 78.

<text>Charles Melvin Price (January 1, 1905 – April 22, 1988) was a member of the United States House of Representatives for over 40 years, from 1945 to his death. He represented Metro East, the Illinois portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area.

==Early life==
Charles Melvin Price was born in East St. Louis, Illinois on January 1, 1905. After a parochial school education, he graduated from St. Louis University High School and took two years of pre-law coursework at Saint Louis University. He became a sports correspondent for the East St. Louis Journal and later the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He served as a member of the St. Clair County Board of Supervisors from 1929 to 1931. He served as secretary to Edwin M. Schaefer during the latter&#x27;s term of office from 1933 to 1943. In October 1943, he voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army. He was stationed at Fort Lee at the time of his election to the United States House of Representatives.

==United States House of Representatives==
He was elected to Congress in his own right in 1944.

Most notably, he served as the chairman of the United States House Committee on Armed Services between 1975 and 1985. He lost this position at the beginning of the 99th United States Congress. Overthrowing a committee chairman was not a common occurrence at that time, but a majority of the House Democratic Caucus seemed to feel that the aged Price was no longer up to the job. In addition, Price, while liberal on domestic issues, was notably more supportive of defense spending than most Democrats. When it came to choosing Price&#x27;s successor, the Caucus bypassed several other old hawkish members of the committee in favor of Les Aspin, who was not only much younger than Price and other more senior members, but also seemed closer in his defense policy preferences to the majority of the Democratic Caucus.

During his time in Congress, he also chaired the Ethics Committee (1967–76) and the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (1973–74). He remained in Congress until his death. Congressman Price had a role in enacting the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act. He died in 1988 of pancreatic cancer. Price is the namesake of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam, near Alton, Illinois on the Upper Mississippi River, and the Melvin Price Federal Building and United States Courthouse in East St. Louis.

In the special election to succeed Price, fellow Democrat and chairman of the St. Clair County Board, Jerry Costello defeated Republican candidate Robert Gaffner. Costello took office August 9, 1988. He was elected to a full term that November with 53% of the vote.

<text>Irving Lanouette Price (September 21, 1884 – November 23, 1976) was an American toy manufacturer.

Price was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1884 had a successful career as an executive with Woolworth. He retired at an early age and was elected mayor of East Aurora, New York.

He was the co-founder and co-eponym of Fisher-Price Toys in 1930. On 23 February 1909, he married the children&#x27;s book illustrator and artist Margaret Evans Price (1888–1973). Margaret was a member of the wealthy Evans family of New York who for a time had an effective monopoly on the building material industry in that city.

In 2014, debates flared on whether his former home in East Aurora should be demolished or preserved for local historical purposes. The owner of the house wanted to knock it down to make room for a parking lot. The matter was resolved on May 1, 2014, when the village trustees granted the house landmark status.

<text>An open proxy is a type of proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user.

Generally, a proxy server only allows users within a network group (i.e. a closed proxy) to store and forward Internet services such as DNS or web pages to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group. With an open proxy, however, any user on the Internet can use this forwarding service.

==Advantages==
An anonymous open proxy is useful to those looking for online anonymity and privacy, as it can help users hide their IP address from web servers since the server requests appear to originate from the proxy server. It makes it harder to reveal their identity and thereby helps preserve their perceived security while browsing the web or using other internet services. Real anonymity and extensive internet security might not be achieved by this measure alone as website operators can use client-side scripts to determine the browser&#x27;s real IP address and the open proxy may be keeping logs of all connections. Open proxies also do not stop tracking cookies and fingerprinters from identifying users.

Most public VPNs work through open proxies.

==Disadvantages==
It is possible for a computer to run as an open proxy server without the computer&#x27;s owner knowing it. This can result from misconfiguration of proxy software running on the computer, or from infection with malware (viruses, trojans or worms) designed for this purpose. If it is caused by malware, the infected computer is known as a zombie computer.

==Testing for access from an open proxy==
Because open proxies are often implicated in abuse, a number of methods have been developed to detect them and to refuse service to them. IRC networks with strict usage policies automatically test client systems for known types of open proxies. Likewise, a mail server may be configured to automatically test mail senders for open proxies, using software such as codice_1.

Groups of IRC and electronic mail operators run DNSBLs publishing lists of the IP addresses of known open proxies, such as AHBL, CBL, NJABL (till 2013), and SORBS (in operation since 2002). The AHBL discontinued public access in 2015.

<text>James Price (1752 – 3 August 1783), born James Higginbottom, was an English chemist and alchemist who claimed to be able to turn mercury into silver or gold. When challenged to perform the conversion a second time in front of credible witnesses, he instead killed himself by drinking prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide).

==Early life==
Born in London in 1752, his original surname was Higginbottom, but he changed it to Price following the wishes of a relative who had died and left him a legacy. He attended Oxford University and, although no records of his early education or his research at Oxford exist, had a successful career there. He became a Master of Arts at 25 and the university made him a Doctor of Medicine in 1778, particularly for his work in the field of chemistry. In 1781, at the age of 29, he became a member of the Royal Society.

==Work on transmutation==
In the following year, he began working on the transmutation of base metals into precious metals and on 6 May 1782, after revealing his findings to a few of his friends, he hosted a series of public experiments at his laboratory in Guildford. He claimed that he could produce precious metals by mixing borax, nitre, and a red or white powder of his own devising (which he called the powder of production) with fifty times its own weight in mercury and stirring the mixture in a crucible with an iron rod. Mixing in the red powder allegedly produced gold; the white powder, silver. He performed seven of the public demonstrations, the final one being on 25 May 1782, which were attended by peers, clergymen, lawyers, and chemists. Some of the gold that Price claimed was produced during the experiments was presented to King George III.

==Challenged by other Fellows==
The Fellows of the Royal Society were less convinced, however, and asked him to repeat the experiments in the presence of some of the members of the society, which Price was reluctant to do. He claimed that his powders were exhausted and preparation of new samples would cost him time and money and be damaging to his health. He also protested that the cost of preparing the gold or silver by this method was not economical, as it cost £17 to make an ounce of gold, which was only valued at £4. The Royal Society insisted on the repetition of the experiments and reminded Price that, as a member, he was calling the honour of the society into question. Price rebuked them, claiming that his reputation and position in society should prevent any hint of suspicion from being cast upon the veracity of his claims, but he was eventually forced to submit.

==Events leading to suicide==
In January 1783, Price returned to his laboratory in Guildford, ostensibly to start production of the miraculous powders. In fact, he set about the distillation of laurel water (which contained hydrogen cyanide, commonly known as prussic acid). He wrote his will at the same time, but it was another six months before he returned to London to invite members of the Royal Society to witness the experiment on 3 August in his laboratory in Guildford.

Despite the claimed successes of his initial demonstrations and the furor they had caused, only three members turned up in Guildford on the appointed day. Although clearly disappointed by the poor turnout, Price welcomed the three men and then, stepping to one side, ended his life by drinking the flask of laurel water he had prepared. The three men immediately noticed a change in his appearance, but before they could do anything, Price had died of cyanide poisoning.

<text>Sir Richard George May (12 November 1938 – 1 July 2004) was a British judge.

May was born in London and educated at Haileybury. Following national service with the Durham Light Infantry, he studied law at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1965, and practised on the Midland and Oxford Circuit, principally in criminal prosecution work, initially from chambers at 10 King&#x27;s Bench Walk and latterly from Devereux Chambers. He was a Recorder of the Crown Court until he was appointed as a Circuit Judge in 1987.

He was also an active member of the Labour Party in Westminster from the mid-1960s, fighting unsuccessfully for a seat on Westminster City Council in 1968. He was a Parliamentary candidate in South Dorset in the 1970 general election.

In 1971 May was elected to Westminster City Council, where he led the Labour Group from 1974 to 1977. He stood down from the council in 1978 to concentrate on his legal career but was still able to stand in the 1979 contest in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Finchley constituency, when she first came to power as Prime Minister.

He came into the international limelight with his 1997 appointment to the UN&#x27;s International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Most notably, he served as the presiding judge in the proceedings to prosecute former Serbian and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević on war crimes charges.

May stepped down from that position, on grounds of poor health, in February 2004. He was knighted in June 2004 and died at his home in Oxfordshire a few weeks later of a brain tumour.

<doc id="769280" wikidata="Q281372" url="?curid=769280" title="Disk quota">
<text>A disk quota is a limit set by a system administrator that restricts certain aspects of file system usage on modern operating systems. The function of using disk quotas is to allocate limited disk space in a reasonable way.

==Types of quotas==
There are two basic types of disk quotas. The first, known as a &quot;usage quota&quot; or &quot;block quota&quot;, limits the amount of disk space that can be used. The second, known as a &quot;file quota&quot; or &quot;inode quota&quot;, limits the number of files and directories that can be created.

In addition, administrators usually define a warning level, or &quot;soft quota&quot;, at which users are informed they are nearing their limit, that is less than the effective limit, or &quot;hard quota&quot;. There may also be a small &quot;grace interval&quot;, which allows users to temporarily violate their quotas by certain amounts if necessary.

==Quotas==
Disk quotas are typically implemented on a per-user or per-group basis. That is, a system administrator defines a usage or file quota specific to a certain user or group. In some filesystems (e.g. ext4, XFS, f2fs, ZFS, Lustre) it is also possible to also define block and inode quota limits for a particular project or directory, by adding a project ID to files that directory tree and defining quota limits for the project ID.

In doing so, an administrator can prevent one user from consuming an entire file system&#x27;s resources, or create a system of tiered access, whereby users can have different levels of restriction. This is used, for example, by web hosting companies to provide different levels of service based upon the needs and means of individual clients.

In most cases, quotas are also specific to individual file systems. Should an administrator want to limit the usage of a specific user on all file systems, a separate quota would have to be specified on each.

When a soft quota is violated, the system normally sends the user (and sometimes the administrator as well) some sort of message. No further action is typically taken.

Some systems prevent disk write operations that would result in hard quota violations from completing successfully, while others wait until the quota has been physically violated before denying write requests. The user is typically notified through the failed write operation error messages generated by the violating applications, while the administrator is almost always sent a notification as well.
Disk quotas are supported by most modern operating systems, including Unix-like systems, such as AIX (using JFS or JFS2 filesystem), Linux (using ext3, ext4, ext2, XFS (integrated support) among other filesystems), Solaris (using UFS or ZFS), Microsoft Windows starting with Windows 2000, Novell NetWare, VMS, and others. The method of administration for disk quotas varies between each of these operating systems. Unix-like systems typically provide a codice_1 command for both administration and monitoring; graphical front-ends to the command may also be used. Unix and Unix-like operating systems frequently feature a grace period where users may exceed their quota limits for a brief period of time. Windows 2000 and newer versions use the &quot;Quota&quot; tab of the disk properties dialog. Other systems provide their own quota management utilities.

==Common Unix disk quota utilities==
* – display a user&#x27;s file system disk quota and usage;
* – Edit user quotas for file system;
* – Set disk quotas for file system;
* – Summarize quotas for a file system;
* – File system quota consistency checker;
* – Turn file system quotas on and off;
* /etc/fstab (Linux) or /etc/vfstab (Solaris) – list of default parameters for each file system including quota status.

<text>Pridi Banomyong (, , ; 11 May 1900 – 2 May 1983), also known by his noble title [[Thai_nobility#Noble_titles|Luang]] Praditmanutham (), was a Thai lawyer, professor, activist, politician, and senior statesman He served in multiple ministerial posts, as regent, and as prime minister in Thailand. He led the civilian wing of Khana Ratsadon, and helped found the University of Moral and Political Sciences and the Bank of Thailand.

Born to a family of farmers in Ayutthaya province, he received a good education, becoming one of the nation&#x27;s youngest barristers in 1919, at the age of nineteen. In 1920, he won a royal scholarship granted by the King of Siam to study in France, where he graduated from the University of Caen with a master&#x27;s degree, and received a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1927. In the same year, he co-founded Khana Ratsadon with like-minded Siamese overseas royal-sponsored students. After returning to Thailand, still called Siam at the time, he worked as a judge, judicial secretariat, and professor. In the aftermath of 1932 Siamese Revolution, he played an important role in drafting two of the country&#x27;s first constitutions and proposing a socialist economic plan influenced by communism scheme, principles and conducts. His plan was ill-received, and Pridi went into a short period of political exile as aftermatch of the fight-for-power with his fellow revolutionists. On his return, he took many ministerial posts in Khana Ratsadon governments. His contributions include modernizing Thai legal codes, laying the foundation for Thailand&#x27;s local government system, negotiating the cancellation of unequal treaties with the West, and tax reform.

Pridi diverged from Plaek Phibunsongkhram after the latter began to display a taste for dictatorial governance in the 1930s, marking the beginning of the long rivalry between the two Khana Ratsadon leaders. Pridi was made Regent during 1941 to 1945, a powerless post at the time. Shortly thereafter, he became leader of the domestic Free Thai Movement during World War II. He briefly became prime minister in 1946, but his political opponents painted him as the mastermind behind the mysterious death of King Ananda Mahidol, and a coup in 1947 cost him his political power. An attempt to stage a counter-coup in 1949 failed and Pridi spent the rest of his life living in exile. He died in Paris in 1983, and his ashes were brought back to Thailand three years later.

His image ranged from that of an anti-monarchist democrat to a republican. The branding of Pridi as a communist and a mastermind of King Ananda&#x27;s death has since been regarded as politically motivated, which his opponents continued to use even after his death. However, Pridi won every libel lawsuit in Thailand filed against those who promoted such views. He became a symbol of resistance against military dictatorships, liberal politics, and Thammasat University. The centenary of his birth was celebrated by UNESCO in 2000.

==Ancestry==
Pridi wrote that his great-great-great-grandfather, Heng, was a native of Etang Village in the Chenghai County of Guangdong Province, southern China, who came to Siam during the reign of Boromaracha V (Ekkathat) (r. 17581767), leaving behind his wife, who was pregnant with their son, Seng. Heng lived in Siam among the Chinese relatives of King Taksin, who recruited some of the local Chinese, including Heng, to fight against the Burmese invaders in 1767. Heng died in the service of the half-Chinese king. Taksin compensated Heng&#x27;s family, after they sent a letter inquiring about him. Seng chose to live his life in China as a rice farmer.

However, Seng&#x27;s son, Tan Nai Kok (陳盛于/陈盛于; Chen Chengyu; Tan Sêng-u), emigrated to Siam in 1814, during the reign of King Rama II. Nai Kok settled in Ayutthaya and made his living by selling Chinese and Thai sweets; it is said he had made innovations by combining Chinese and Thai culinary skills. A devout Buddhist, Nai Kok married a Thai woman named Pin. Pin&#x27;s sister, Boonma, would become an ancestor of Pridi&#x27;s wife Poonsuk. Their son, Nai Koet, married Khum, daughter of a wealthy Chinese entrepreneur. When Nai Koet died, his wife directed that his remains were to be cremated and interred at the shrine at Phanomyong Hill, which is the origin of their Thai surname. Their son, Nai Siang, who became a wealthy rice merchant, married Lukchan; they were the parents of Pridi.

==Early life and education==
Pridi Phanomyong was born in Tha Wasukri Ayutthaya Province, the second of five children. He had two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s minor wife. In 1915, following a royal decree issued by King Vajiravudh, Pridi and his family dropped &quot;Nai&quot; from their names. He completed his secondary education at Suankularb Wittayalai School.

After graduating from the Law School of the Siamese Ministry of Justice as a barrister with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1919, he received a government scholarship to study law and political economy at Sciences Po in Paris. While studying in France, he began assembling a group of fifty civil servants who wanted to turn Thailand&#x27;s then-absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. He earned a PhD in law and a higher diploma in economics and returned to Siam in 1927 to work for the Ministry of Justice. He quickly rose in rank, and was granted the royal title Luang Praditmanutham () in 1928.

== Political career ==

===People&#x27;s Party===

On 24 June 1932, &quot;Khana Ratsadon&quot;, the tiny People&#x27;s Party, with Pridi as the leader of the civilian faction, carried out a lightning coup that abruptly ended 150 years of absolute monarchy under the Chakri dynasty.

In 1933, Pridi published the Draft National Economic Plan, also known as the &quot;Yellow cover dossier&quot;, a radical economic plan calling for the nationalisation of land, public employment, and social security. The plan was rejected by royalists and some ex-members of Khana Ratsadon, who shut down parliament and the judiciary. Pridi was accused of being a communist and went into exile. It is noted, however, that many ideas he proposed finally came into existence, such as the national bank and National Economic Council, and the conservatives only agreed to Pridi in founding national lottery.

===Khana Ratsadon ministerial posts===

Pridi returned to Thailand in 1934 to found Thammasat University as an open university, before assuming the posts of Minister of the Interior that year, Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1935, and Minister of Finance in 1938.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1936 to 1937, Pridi signed treaties revoking the extraterritorial rights of 12 countries. With these treaties, Thailand was able to regain independence with regard to legal jurisdiction and taxation for the first time since unequal treaties were signed under duress during the reign of King Rama IV.

Although he had been friends with Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram during the early days of the People&#x27;s Party, the two fell out in subsequent years. Pridi was anti-Japanese as well as left-leaning. He opposed many of Phibun&#x27;s militaristic policies which tended to be more conciliatory toward the Japanese. The antipathy between the two would define how Thailand fared in World War II when Japan was on the march in Asia.

===Free Thai movement===

On 8 December 1941, Imperial Japan launched attacks on Southeast Asia and the Allied possessions in the region, opening the Pacific War. This included amphibious landings in Thailand and an invasion across the border from French Indochina. After initially resisting, the Thai government reluctantly agreed to let the Japanese pass through the country and use its military bases to strike other Allied possessions in the region, culminating in the Battle of Malaya.

When Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States in January 1942, Pridi refused to sign it, as he served as the Regent for the young monarch, who was studying in Switzerland. In this capacity, Pridi built the anti-Japanese underground, the Free Thai Movement (&quot;Seri Thai&quot;) network, in Thailand. Code named &quot;Ruth&quot;, he established contact with the Allies and Thai resistance organisations in Britain and the United States. As the war progressed and the fortunes of the Japanese declined, public dissatisfaction grew and Phibun was forced to resign as prime minister in 1944.

Khuang Aphaiwong, a liberal lawyer and member of Seri Thai, was chosen to be prime minister due to &quot;his ability to dissemble with the Japanese&quot; to shield the growing Seri Thai movement while at the same time improving superficial relations with the Japanese occupiers.

When Japan&#x27;s surrender ended the war, the Seri Thai-dominated government immediately acted to &quot;restore the pre-war status quo&quot;. As regent, Pridi termed &quot;the declaration of war illegal and null, and void&quot; as improperly made, and repudiated all agreements made with Japan by Phibun.

When Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander, Southeast Asia, visited Bangkok in late-1945, he recorded a tribute to Pridi in which he said that there had existed a unique situation wherein &quot;the Supreme Allied Commander was exchanging vital military plans with the Head of a State technically at war with us&quot;.

===Post-war years===

Pridi retired from the regency when King Ananda Mahidol returned in December 1945. He was formally named a Senior Statesman (&quot;Ratthaburut Awuso&quot;), and served as an advisor to the post-war, civilian governments of Thawi Bunyaket and Seni Pramoj.

In March 1946, Khuang Aphaiwong, who had been elected prime minister in January, resigned. Pridi assumed the position in an attempt to stabilize the political situation, which was spiralling out of control. It was during the first months of the Pridi government that the war crimes trial of Phibun was dismissed on a legal technicality. Having noticed that Khuang shifted more and more conservative, Pridi decided to compete for political power himself. After his political allies voted Khuang out in 1946, he became the 8th Prime Minister of the country.

As the Cold War raging, Thailand became a focus of the United States. Pridi, who supported the Vietnamese independence movement of Ho Chi Minh and establishment of anti-imperialist Southeast Asia League, lost the political support from the US, which led to tacit support to the coup against him.

On the morning of 9 June 1946, the young king was found dead in his bed in the Baromphiman Mansion in the Grand Palace, dead from a gunshot wound to his head. In October 1946, a commission ruled that the King&#x27;s death could not have been accidental, but that neither suicide nor murder was satisfactorily proved. Sulak Sivaraksa, a prominent conservative and monarchist, wrote that Pridi&#x27;s role in the event was he protected responsible royals, and prevented the arrest of a person who destroyed the evidence. However, when his government cannot solve the case, his political opponents quickly put the blame on him; some went so far as to branding him as the mastermind behind the assassination.

After a general election, Pridi resigned as prime minister, resumed his role of senior statesman, and left on a world tour, visiting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and US president Harry S. Truman along the way.

Pridi&#x27;s opponents composed of royalist, conservative and military camps. On 8 November 1947, army troops seized various government installations in Bangkok. The coup, led by Lieutenant General Phin Choonhavan and Colonel Kat Katsongkhram, ousted Thamrong&#x27;s government, which is the political ally of Pridi. He spent a week hiding in Admiral Sindhu Songkhramchai&#x27;s headquarters. On 20 November, he was spirited to Singapore by British and US agents. The 1947 coup marked the return to power of Phibun, and the end of Khana Ratsadon&#x27;s role in Thai politics. (At this time, Phibun was often considered in the military camp.)

Phibun arrested King Ananda&#x27;s secretary, Senator Chaleo Patoomros, and two of his pages under charges of conspiracy to kill the king. Rumours were spread that Pridi was part of a conspiracy involved in the alleged regicide, and that he had plans to turn Thailand into a republic. After a farcical trial, during which the entire defence team resigned and two members of a subsequent team were arrested under charges of treason, the judges sentenced three royal pages, associated with Pridi, to death.

Biographer William Stevenson has said that King Bhumibol Adulyadej did not believe that Pridi was involved in his brother&#x27;s death.

===Permanent exile===

Pridi secretly returned in 1949 in order to stage a coup d&#x27;état against Phibun&#x27;s dictatorship. When it failed, Pridi left for China, never to return to Thailand. In 1970, he travelled to France, where he spent the remainder of his life. Pridi died on 2 May 1983, at his home in the suburbs of Paris.

==Legacy==
Pridi remains a controversial figure in Thai modern history. As one of the leaders of the 1932 pro-democracy coup, he has been viewed in many ways. The first declaration of the &quot;revolution,&quot; which harshly attacked the king and his government, was written by Pridi himself. Nevertheless, Pridi held the position of regent when Rama VIII ascended to the throne.

During the period of military rule, Pridi was portrayed as a communist as several of his books and articles showed sympathy for Marxist, socialist, and communist ideologies.

With obvious conflict between Pridi and the King Rama VIII, the young king&#x27;s tragic death came to be blamed on Pridi. Pridi was accused of being the leader of a plot to assassinate the popular young monarch. This culminated in the military coup in 1947.

In his later years, Seni Pramoj promoted the idea that he had saved Thailand from post-war British colonial rule that Pridi had been willing to accept. Nigel Brailey treats the Free Thai movement as largely a sham and casts doubt on Pridi&#x27;s part, arguing &quot;it appears questionable whether Pridi committed himself personally to the Allied cause much prior to August 1942, if even then,&quot; suggesting that &quot;his eventual anti-Japanese stance was a consequence primarily of his hostility to Phibun.&quot;

Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an opportunity to do so. However, Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand&#x27;s alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun&#x27;s advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi&#x27;s hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.

One-time conservative monarchist Sulak Sivaraksa has emerged as one of Pridi&#x27;s most ardent champions. A prolific critic of the Thai status quo, Sulak, in addition to praising the achievements of the Free Thai in saving Thailand&#x27;s sovereignty, has criticised Seni and his Democrat Party for alleged complicity in the military&#x27;s return to power in 1947.

Sulak led efforts to rehabilitate Pridi which achieved significant results. Four Bangkok streets now are named for Pridi: three as Pridi Banomyong Road and one called Praditmanutham (his royally granted title) Road. His birthday, 11 May, is now celebrated as Pridi Banomyong Day. In 1997, the Thai government dedicated a park in eastern Bangkok to the Free Thai resistance movement. On 16 August 2003, a library-museum, built as a replica of Pridi&#x27;s wartime residence, opened at the park.

On 30 October 1999, UNESCO included the centenary of Pridi Phanomyong&#x27;s birth in its recognition of anniversaries of great personalities and historic events as tribute to his ideals and integrity.

There are two Pridi Banomyong Memorials, one in Pridi&#x27;s hometown, the other on the campus of Thammasat University, which he founded. Thammasat is home to the Pridi Banomyong Library and the Pridi Banomyong International College. The law faculty at Dhurakij Pundit University is called the Pridi Banomyong Faculty of Law. The Pridi (&quot;Chloropsis aurifrons pridii&quot;), a species of leafbird, and Pridi Banomyong Institute, a non-profit academic organisation, are named in his honour. The Pridi Banomyong Institute holds an annual Pridi Banomyong Lecture, initially on Pridi Banomyong Day, but moved in recent years to 24 June, in honour of his role in the 1932 coup.

<text>James Percy Priest (April 1, 1900 – October 12, 1956) was an American teacher, journalist and politician who represented Tennessee in the United States House of Representatives from 1941 until his death.

== Background ==
Priest was born in Carters Creek, Maury County, Tennessee, the son of George and Harriet (née Hastings) Priest. He attended Central High School in Columbia, and afterward continued his education at State Teachers&#x27; College in Murfreesboro (now Middle Tennessee State University), Peabody College in Nashville, and the University of Tennessee. He taught school in Culleoka, in his native Maury County, from 1920 until 1926, when he joined the editorial staff of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. In 1937, he began courting Mildred Webster Noland, whom he would marry in 1947. They had one daughter, Harriet.

== Congress ==
In 1940, Priest was encouraged to run for the United States House of Representatives as an independent in Tennessee&#x27;s 5th congressional district, which is based in Nashville. He won in an upset, defeating the incumbent, one-term Democratic Congressman Jo Byrns Jr. Upon swearing-in, he immediately joined the Democratic caucus, and was reelected seven times. The district was renumbered the 6th District in 1943 and became the 5th once again in 1953. He served as the House majority whip between 1949 and 1953. Priest was one of three Democrats in the Tennessee House delegation who did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, the others being Joe Evins and Ross Bass.

At the time of his death, Priest was serving as the chairman of the House Commerce Committee and had already secured the Democratic nomination for a ninth term, which had essentially assured him of reelection since no Republican has been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Nashville since Reconstruction.

== Death and legacy ==
In early October 1956, Priest entered a Nashville hospital for an operation on an ulcer and was reported in satisfactory condition. However, complications developed and he died in the early morning hours of October 12.

Priest was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Nashville. J. Percy Priest Dam, a United States Army Corps of Engineers hydroelectric and flood control structure just east of Nashville on the Stones River (and easily visible from Interstate 40) is named in his honor, as is Percy Priest Lake (created by the dam) and an elementary school in Forest Hills, a suburb of Nashville.

In August 2010, it was announced that Priest&#x27;s papers, along with the research files of Rebecca Stubbs, author of the biography &quot;J. Percy Priest and His Amazing Race&quot;, had been donated to the Tennessee State Library and Archives.

<text>Willibald Schulze was a German writer who belonged to the Nazi Party.

==Work==
Willibald Schulze praised Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as the Wegweiser, or signpost, of the Third Reich because Proudhon rejected revolutionary socialism, interest capital and parliamentarianism. He asserted that Proudhon&#x27;s ideas were closer to National Socialism.

<text>Anne Sofie von Otter (born 9 May 1955) is a Swedish mezzo-soprano. Her repertoire encompasses lieder, operas, oratorios and also rock and pop songs.

==Early life==
Von Otter was born in Stockholm, Sweden. Her father was Göran von Otter, a Swedish diplomat in Berlin during World War II. She grew up in Bonn, London and Stockholm. She studied in Stockholm and at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where her teachers included Vera Rózsa. In 1982, she won second prize in the ARD International Music Competition.

From 1983 to 1985, she was an ensemble member of the Basel Opera, where she made her professional operatic début as Alcina in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Orlando paladino&quot;. She made her Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, début in 1985 and her La Scala debut in 1987. Her Metropolitan Opera début was in December 1988 as Cherubino in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;.

== Career ==
Her recording of Grieg songs won the 1993 &quot;Gramophone&quot; Record of the Year, the first time in the award&#x27;s history that it had gone to a song recording. In 2001, she released her album with Elvis Costello, &quot;For the Stars&quot;, for which she won an Edison Award. She was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo in 2015 for her album of French songs, &quot;Douce France&quot;. She is a regular recital and recording partner with Swedish pianist Bengt Forsberg.

In 2006, von Otter sang the Evangelist in the premiere of Sven-David Sandström&#x27;s &quot;Ordet – en passion&quot;. Other work in contemporary music has included singing the role of The Woman in &quot;Senza Sangue&quot; of Péter Eötvös. In other media, she appeared in the film &quot;A Late Quartet&quot;.

In 2007, she released an album of music written by composers imprisoned in the Nazi ghetto of Theresienstadt concentration camp (also known as Terezin) before their transportation to the death camp of Auschwitz. She collaborated on this project with Christian Gerhaher (baritone) and chamber musicians. She has stated that the material has special personal meaning for her as her father had attempted unsuccessfully during the war to spread information that he had received from SS officer Kurt Gerstein about the Nazi death camps.

In 2016, von Otter sang Leonora in the world premiere of Thomas Adès&#x27; &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot;, and again in 2017 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. She created the principal role of Charlotte in Sebastian Fagerlund&#x27;s 2017 opera &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;, based on the 1979 film by Ingmar Bergman at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki conducted by John Storgårds.

== Family life ==
Von Otter was married to Benny Fredriksson until his suicide on 17 March 2018. He was an actor and managing director of The Stockholm House of Culture, including the Stadsteater (Stockholm City Theatre). The couple had two children. She lives in the capital Stockholm.

==Awards and honours==
*1995: appointed Hovsångerska by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden

<text>Al Hudaydah (), also transliterated as Hodeda, Hodeida, Hudaida or Hodeidah, is the fourth-largest city in Yemen and its principal port on the Red Sea and it is the centre of Al Hudaydah Governorate. As of 2023, it has an estimated population of 735,000.

==History==
In Islamic chronicles, the name Al-Hudaydah was first mentioned in the year 1454/55. The city&#x27;s importance grew in the 1520s, when the Ottomans took over the Yemeni Tihāmah region.

In the 1830s, Al-Hudaydah was controlled by Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s troops, which turned over its administration to Sherif Husayn ibn Ali Haydar. In 1849, it became part of the Yemen Eyalet.

The Malay writer Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir visited Al-Hudaydah on his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1854, and describes the city in his account of the journey, mentioning that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in the city at this time.

During the 19th century, Al-Hudaydah had a large slave market. The slaves came from the Oromia region of modern Ethiopia.
In 1914, during World War I, Imperial German troops led by Major Freiherr Othmar von Stotzingen established &quot;&quot;, a wireless station, at Al-Hudaydah, which was used during the Arab Revolt to relay communications from Constantinople (now Istanbul) to German East Africa as well as broadcast propaganda to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Somalis land part of population Northern side and Abyssinia.

The city was briefly occupied by Saudi forces during the Saudi–Yemeni war of 1934.

After a disastrous fire in January 1961 destroyed much of Al-Hudaydah, it was rebuilt, particularly the port facilities, with Soviet aid. A highway to Sanaa, the capital, was completed in 1961. The city was also the site of a Soviet naval base in the 1970s and 1980s.

On 20 July 2024, during the Israel–Hamas war, the city was the target of an Israeli air raid in response to repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and an attack on Tel Aviv that resulted in the death of a civilian. The Israeli strike targeted port oil facilities and a power plant, resulting in a large fire killing six and wounding 87. The IDF said that they targeted military facilities.

==Economy==
Situated on the Red Sea, Al-Hudaydah is an important port, exporting coffee, cotton, dates and hides. It was developed as a seaport in the mid-19th century by the Ottoman Turks. As of June 2018, three quarters of humanitarian and commercial cargo entering Yemen arrived via the port of Hudaydah. It serves as the entry point for Yemen&#x27;s humanitarian aid and around 70% of commercial imports. The port of Ras Isa is slightly north of Al Hudaydah proper, and is the terminus of the Marib–Ras Isa oil pipeline from inland Yemen, with a major storage and offloading vessel named FSO &quot;Safer&quot; moored offshore, though idled since the beginning of the Yemeni Civil War in 2015.

In 1920, the British described Al Hudaydah&#x27;s port as being a &quot;poor harbour.&quot; With two entrances, it was only able to provide adequate storage and shelter for small boats, with larger boats and ships having to dock over two miles away. In 1908, a new pier was built, which had trouble with depth, leading most imported items to be dumped on the beach instead of delivered by dock. Coal was often available for visiting vessels. A new harbour was built 10 miles northwest of the town by the Ottoman government, with a small train line leading to Al Hudaydah, and connected to the Sana-Hodeida Railway. A French company built the rail system, which was halted upon the Italo-Turkish War breakout. In 1909, the port was bringing in less than the port at Jeddah. That year, 172 steam ships visited the port. The majority of the goods were from the United Kingdom, followed by Italy, Russia and Germany. German imports had grown from 1905 to 1909, with British shipping declining. Despite struggles with a good quality harbour, the town was described as being the centre of dhow building.

The city was known for producing striped coarse cotton cloth, woven by hand. The artisans making the cloth were relocated to Al Hudaydah from Zabīd and Beit el-Faki due to tribal conflict. The city was also a centre for tanning and sandal making.

In the late 19th century, Al-Hudaydah was a major exporter of coffee, although its export business shifted to Aden in the early 20th century due to more secure routes there. Al-Hudaydah had to transport its goods through Yemen and Indian ports for security reasons, making export to the United Kingdom troublesome. During this time period, the region imported cereal and rice from India, cotton from Manchester, England and the United States, iron and steel from Germany, and general goods from Italy and Austria. As of 1920, the city was exporting fuller&#x27;s earth, hides, and coffee. The coffee produced in Al-Hudaydah was considered some of the finest in the region.

==Yemeni civil war==

The Hudaydah Port plays a crucial role in allowing food to be imported into the country. This role has been disrupted several times over the course of the Yemeni civil war.

In June 2018, pro-Hadi government forces with the backing of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia entered the port, in an effort to dislodge Houthi forces. Due to the risk of a humanitarian crisis if the port is besieged, the United Nations attempted to secure an agreement with the Houthis to place the port under UN control, but was unsuccessful until 13 December 2018, on which date there was an announcement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the two sides to the civil war have reached an agreement on a ceasefire.
In July 2024, the port was attacked by Israel in retaliation for the Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.

== Topography == 

Al-Hudaydah is generally composed of a flat plain that gently slopes towards the sea. The elevated areas consist mainly of small sand dunes or remnants of inland masses. Geologically, this coastal plain is part of the Red Sea rift valley, covered by recent deposits, which can be divided into two categories, though it’s difficult to distinguish their boundaries. Near the Red Sea coast, the deposits are primarily marine formations from the late Tertiary and Quaternary periods, covered by modern wind-blown sand deposits. In contrast, near the foothills of the mountains, deltaic deposits are found, some of which are coarse, consisting of large gravel and rock fragments, while others are finer particles carried by streams descending from the mountains. These coarse deltaic deposits gradually disappear under sand deposits, and at the boundary between the two, freshwater springs emerge.

The province&#x27;s surface can be divided into three sections:

Coastal Plains: The majority of Al-Hudaydah’s land lies within the Tihama coastal plain, which stretches from Al-Luhayyah in the north to Al-Khawkhah in the south, spanning approximately 300 kilometers in length and 60 to 150 kilometers in width. This plain is traversed by several valleys, which are outlets for flood and rainwater flowing from the internal highlands of the province and from the highlands and mountains of the neighboring provinces of Ibb, Dhamar, Sana&#x27;a, Al-Mahwit, and Hajjah, eventually emptying into the Red Sea. Major valleys include, Wadi Mour, Wadi Siham, Wadi Zabid, among others.

Mountain Highlands: Notable mountains include Jabal Ras and Jabal Bura, both reaching elevations of 2,000 to 2,400 meters above sea level.

Islands: There are over 40 Yemeni islands in the Red Sea off the coast of Al-Hudaydah, with notable ones being Kamaran,Hanish Islands, and Taqfash Island.

==Climate==
Al Hudaydah has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BWh&quot;).

<text>the Minnesota Golden Gophers



Laverne Clarence &quot;Verne&quot; Gagne ( ; February 26, 1926 – April 27, 2015) was an American amateur and professional wrestler, football player, wrestling trainer and wrestling promoter. He was the owner and promoter of the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association (AWA), the predominant promotion throughout the Midwest and Manitoba for many years. He remained in this position until 1991, when the company folded.

As an amateur wrestler, Gagne won two NCAA titles and was an alternate for the U.S. freestyle wrestling team at the 1948 Olympic Games before turning professional in 1949. Gagne was an 11-time world champion in major professional wrestling promotions, having held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship ten times and the IWA World Heavyweight Championship once as the IWA World Heavyweight Championship was considered a world championship in Japan. He has also won top professional wrestling promotions World Heavyweight Championships such as the World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version) five times. He holds the record for the longest combined reign as a world champion in North America and is third (behind Bruno Sammartino and Lou Thesz) for the longest single world title reign. He is one of only seven men inducted into each of the WWE, WCW and Professional Wrestling halls of fame.

==Early life==

Gagne was born in Corcoran, Minnesota, and grew up on a farm in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. He left home at the age of 14 after his mother died. He attended Robbinsdale High School, where he went on to win the state championship for high school wrestling in 1942 and 1943. In 1943, he was recruited to play football at the University of Minnesota as defensive end and tight end, while also continuing wrestling. As a freshman, Gagne won the Big Ten 175 pound wrestling title in 1944 after returning from duty in the Marine Corps.

==Amateur wrestling career==
Gagne&#x27;s football and wrestling career was interrupted by a tour of duty with the United States Marine Corps in 1943. He played on the Marines Football Team with the likes of Elroy &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Hirsch, Gopher Great George Franck and other NFL Stars. Gagne also served with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Underwater Demolition Team. He chose to return to the University of Minnesota, where, as an amateur wrestler, he captured two NCAA titles. In 1948, he beat Charles Gottfried of Illinois in the 191-pound class to win his first NCAA championship in Pennsylvania.

The next year, he returned to the championships but had moved up a class, to heavyweight. In the final, he met future NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dick Hutton, the two-time defending national champion in the division. The showdown ended in a 1–1 tie, but Gagne was awarded the win because he controlled Hutton for longer periods of the match.

He was also an alternate for the U.S. freestyle wrestling team at the 1948 Olympic Games, after losing a closely contested wrestle-off match to the eventual gold medalist Henry Wittenberg. He earned the starting spot for the U.S. Greco-Roman wrestling team for the 1948 Olympics by finishing second in the U.S. freestyle wrestle-offs, but upon arriving to London, the U.S. coaches decided that the Greco-Roman team would not be competing.

==Football career==

Gagne joined the National Football League (NFL) soon after being drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 16th round (145th pick) of the 1947 NFL draft.

In 2006&#x27;s The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA, Verne&#x27;s son, Greg, said in an interview that Bears owner George Halas prevented his father from pursuing both football and wrestling, and forced him to make a choice. In the same interview, Greg mentioned that wrestling was a much better paying job at the time than playing football and as a result, Verne chose wrestling over football.

By 1949, Gagne had signed with the NFL&#x27;s Green Bay Packers. He went on to play three preseason games with the Packers before being released.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== National Wrestling Alliance (1953–1960) ===

In 1949, Gagne decided to wrestle professionally, starting his career in Texas. In his debut, he defeated Abe Kashey, with former World Heavyweight boxing Champion Jack Dempsey as the referee. On November 13, 1950, Gagne captured the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Junior Heavyweight title in a tournament for the vacant championship.

In September 1953 in Fred Kohler Enterprises, Gagne was awarded the newly created Chicago version of the NWA United States Championship. Gagne became one of the most well-known stars in wrestling during the golden age of television, thanks to his exposure on the Dumont Network, where he wowed audiences with his technical prowess. He was rumored to be one of the highest-paid wrestlers during the 1950s, reportedly earning a hundred thousand dollars a year.

On June 14, 1957, Edouard Carpentier defeated NWA Champion Lou Thesz in Chicago. The NWA later overruled the decision of the referee in Chicago and gave the title back to Thesz. However, certain wrestling territories of the NWA including Nebraska refused to go along with the decision and continued to recognize Carpentier. Carpentier lost his title to Gagne in Omaha on August 9, 1958, making him the recognized NWA World champion in the NWA territories that had recognized Carpentier, before dropping the belt three months later to Wilbur Snyder. By early 1960, the wealthy Gagne rarely wrestled and turned his focus towards building a wrestling promotion of his own.

=== American Wrestling Association (1960–1991) ===
In 1960, Gagne formed his own promotion, the American Wrestling Alliance (later it became Association). Before this, the Minneapolis territory was under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) umbrella. Setting up to pull away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known), gave a &quot;story-line only&quot; edict to the NWA in May 1960 that unless their NWA World Champion Pat O&#x27;Connor defended his title against Verne Gagne with 90 days, Verne Gagne would become recognized World Champion by default. There was never any intention of such a match taking place. At the end of the 90 day period, the AWA was formed in August 1960 and it was announced that because NWA champion Pat O&#x27;Connor failed to meet Gagne, that the AWA recognized Gagne as the first AWA World Champion.

Some of Gagne&#x27;s biggest feuds were against Gene Kiniski, Dr. Bill Miller (under a mask both as Dr. X and then Mr. M), Fritz Von Erich, Dr. X, The Crusher, Ray Stevens, Mad Dog Vachon, Larry Hennig and Nick Bockwinkel while champion and title changes. He always wrestled as a face and utilized the sleeper hold as his finisher. His longest reign as champion was for 7 years, from August 31, 1968, to November 8, 1975, dropping the title to Nick Bockwinkel. He would regain the title from Bockwinkel on July 18, 1980, and drop it back to Bockwinkel on May 19, 1981.

After his last title lost in 1981, Gagne would wrestle occasionally for AWA until 1986. His last match was a six-man tag with his son Greg, and Jimmy Snuka defeating Boris Zhukov, John Nord and 
Sheik Adnan Al-Kassie on June 29, 1986.
As AWA head, Gagne was known for putting on an &quot;old school&quot; show. He sought out wrestlers with amateur backgrounds over the larger, more impressive-looking wrestlers who dominated professional wrestling in the 1980s. This led to a problem with his biggest draw, Hulk Hogan, whom Gagne had acquired after Hogan had been let go by the World Wide Wrestling Federation and who Gagne also felt was not championship material, due to the fact that Hogan was a power wrestler rather than a technical wrestler. Seeing Hogan as the company&#x27;s top draw, Gagne did, however, let Hogan feud with Bockwinkel.

Eventually, as noted on the 2006 &quot;Spectacular Legacy of AWA&quot; DVD, Gagne agreed to make Hogan his champion after Hogan&#x27;s feud with Bockwinkel ran its course in April 1983, but only on condition that Gagne would receive the bulk of Hogan&#x27;s revenues from both merchandise sales and his matches in Japan, which Hogan refused. In late 1983, Hogan accepted an offer from Vincent K. McMahon to return to the WWF. The Iron Sheik, whom Gagne trained, alleged that Gagne bribed him to inflict career-threatening damage on Hogan&#x27;s knee after it became apparent that Hogan was leaving for the WWF. What followed was an exodus of major stars from various territories and promotions, including Gagne&#x27;s AWA, to the WWF. McMahon wished to take his promotion &quot;national&quot; and do away with the traditional territorial system that dominated the North American pro wrestling landscape for decades.

Unlike most of his contemporaries, by the mid-1980s, Gagne began promoting the AWA beyond the geographical bounds of its traditional territory. In September 1985, ESPN began broadcasting &quot;AWA Championship Wrestling&quot;, giving the promotion national exposure like the WWF. However, the AWA suffered numerous setbacks. ESPN did not treat &quot;AWA Championship Wrestling&quot; as a priority; the show was sometimes not aired in its regular time slot (occasionally ESPN would change the time slot without advertising the change beforehand), and sometimes it was preempted by live sporting events. This resulted in many fans being unable to tune in on a regular basis. Gagne&#x27;s booking strategies for the wrestlers themselves continued to follow more traditional themes than those of the WWF, believing as he did that the top stars should be highly gifted technical wrestlers rather than those with just charismatic personalities. Throughout the mid to late 1980s, the AWA would lose the vast majority of its top stars to McMahon, while ratings and live attendance continued to decline. By 1991, the damage had been done, and the AWA shut down after 30 years. Gagne would eventually end up in bankruptcy court.

==Wrestling Halls of Fame==
In April 2006, Gagne was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his son, Greg Gagne. He is one of only seven people to be inducted into the WWE, WCW and Professional Wrestling Halls of Fame.

In 2018, he was inducted into the Nebraska Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame.

==Death of Helmut Gutmann==
On January 26, 2009, Gagne got into an altercation with Helmut Gutmann, a 97-year-old resident of the Bloomington, Minnesota nursing care facility where they both resided. According to Gutmann&#x27;s widow, who was not present during the altercation, Gagne picked Gutmann up and threw him to the floor, then broke his hip by pulling back on his body. &quot;&#x27;The attack happened quickly while the men were at a table&#x27;, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said. &#x27;It was more like &quot;a push and a shove&quot; and it caused Gutmann to fall.&#x27;&quot; Neither man had any recollection of the incident. Gutmann was admitted to the hospital, and died on February 14 from complications of the injury. On February 25, 2009, the older man&#x27;s death was officially ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County medical examiner&#x27;s office. On March 12, 2009, the Hennepin County Prosecutor&#x27;s office officially announced that Gagne would not be criminally charged as a result of the death as, because of Gagne&#x27;s dementia, he lacked the mental capacity necessary to be criminally culpable.

==Illness and death==
Gagne was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (or possibly chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by a lifetime of head injuries) and had been living in the memory-loss section of a Bloomington, Minnesota health care facility. In January 2012 he was living in the home of his daughter Beth and her husband Will. He continued to make public appearances in his last years, aided by his son Greg.

On April 27, 2015, Gagne died in Bloomington at the age of 89.

<text>Francesco Primaticcio (; April 30, 1504 – 1570) was an Italian Mannerist painter, architect and sculptor who spent most of his career in France.

==Biography==
Born in Bologna, he trained under Giulio Romano in Mantua and became a pupil of Innocenzo da Imola, executing decorations at the Palazzo Te before securing a position in the court of Francis I of France in 1532.
Together with Rosso Fiorentino he was one of the leading artists to work at the Chateau Fontainebleau (where he is grouped with the so-called &quot;First School of Fontainebleau&quot;) spending much of his life there. Following Rosso&#x27;s death in 1540, Primaticcio took control of the artistic direction at Fontainebleau, furnishing the painters and stuccators of his team, such as Nicolò dell&#x27;Abate, with designs. He made cartoons for tapestry-weavers and, like all 16th-century court artists, was called upon to design elaborate ephemeral decorations for masques and fêtes, which survive only in preparatory drawings and, sometimes, engravings. Francis I trusted his eye and sent him back to Italy on buying trips in 1540 and again in 1545.

In Rome, part of Primaticcio&#x27;s commission was to take casts of the best Roman sculptures in the papal collections, some of which were cast in bronze to decorate the parterres at Fontainebleau.

Primaticcio retained his position as court painter to Francis&#x27; heirs, Henry II and Francis II. His masterpiece, the &quot;Salle d&#x27;Hercule&quot; at Fontainebleau, occupied him and his team from the 1530s to 1559.

Primaticcio&#x27;s crowded Mannerist compositions and his long-legged canon of beauty influenced French art for the rest of the century.

Primaticcio turned to architecture towards the end of his life, his greatest work being the Valois Chapel at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, although this was not completed until after his death and was destroyed in 1719.

The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour in each direction between and . During the late evenings, the service is reduced to three trains per hour in each direction.


==History==
The station opened on 9 July 1894 as &quot;Leytonstone&quot; with the Tottenham &amp; Forest Gate Railway. Originally, wagons were lowered from the arches to the ground-level goods yard by means of a hydraulic hoist. The station was renamed Leytonstone High Road on 1 May 1949. The original wooden platform buildings were destroyed by fire in the 1950s.

Ticket barriers were installed in 2016.

==Connections==

<text>The Pearse Museum () is dedicated to the memory of Patrick Pearse and his brother, William. Patrick Pearse was an educationalist and nationalist who was executed for his part in the 1916 Rising. The museum is situated in St. Enda&#x27;s Park in the suburb of Rathfarnham on the south side of Dublin, Ireland. It was formerly an Irish speaking school named St. Enda&#x27;s. Originally Pearse&#x27;s school was set up in Ranelagh on 8 September 1908. It moved to Rathfarnham in 1910. After Pearse was executed for his part take in the 1916 rising, and due to decreasing numbers and increasing financial worries, the school closed in 1935. After Patrick Pearse&#x27;s sister (Margaret Mary Pearse) died in 1968, St. Enda&#x27;s and its grounds were handed over to the state, and the school house is now a museum devoted to the Pearse brothers. The museum contains reconstructions of many of the original rooms, including Pearse&#x27;s study, the family sitting room, the school art gallery, the school museum and one of the dormitories. There is also a gallery devoted exclusively to the sculpture of William Pearse. Visitors can also visit a nature study room in the courtyard behind the school house where examples of Irish plants and animals can be found.

The museum is an 18th-century house (built after 1786) situated in a parkland setting: from 1840 to 1857 it was the home of Richard Moore, Attorney General for Ireland and judge.

The museum was closed for renovations in May 2006 and re-opened to the public on 28 November 2008. The museum is open seven days a week and admission is free.

<doc id="769331" wikidata="Q1328652" url="?curid=769331" title="Exeter Book">
<text>The Exeter Book, also known as the Codex Exoniensis or Exeter Cathedral Library MS 3501, is a large codex of Old English poetry, believed to have been produced in the late tenth century AD. It is one of the four major manuscripts of Old English poetry, along with the Vercelli Book in the chapter library of Vercelli Cathedral, Italy, the Nowell Codex in the British Library, and the Junius manuscript in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The Exeter Book was given to what is now the Exeter Cathedral library by Leofric, the first bishop of Exeter, in 1072. It is believed to have originally contained 130 or 131 leaves, of which the first 7 or 8 have been replaced with other leaves; the original first 8 leaves are lost. The Exeter Book is the largest and perhaps oldest known manuscript of Old English literature, containing about a sixth of the Old English poetry that has survived.

In 2016 UNESCO recognized the book as &quot;the foundation volume of English literature, one of the world&#x27;s principal cultural artefacts&quot;.

==History==
The Exeter Book is generally acknowledged to be one of the great works of the English Benedictine revival of the tenth century; the precise dates that it was written and compiled are unknown, although proposed dates range from 960 to 990. This period saw a rise in monastic activity and productivity under the renewed influence of Benedictine principles and standards. At the opening of the period, Dunstan&#x27;s importance to the Church and to the English kingdom was established, culminating in his appointment to the Archbishopric at Canterbury under Edgar of England and leading to the monastic reformation by which this era was characterised. Dunstan died in 998, and by the period&#x27;s close, England under Æthelred faced an increasingly determined Scandinavian incursion, to which it would eventually succumb.

The Exeter Book&#x27;s heritage becomes traceable from the death of Leofric, bishop of Exeter, in 1072. Among the possessions which he bequeathed in his will to the then-impoverished monastery at Exeter (the precursor to the later cathedral) is one famously described as &quot;i mycel Englisc boc be gehwilcum þingum on leoð-wisan geworht&quot;: &quot;one large English book on various subjects, composed in verse form&quot;. This book has been widely identified by scholars as the Exeter Codex.

However Leofric&#x27;s bequest was made at least three generations after the book was written, and it has generally been assumed that it had originated elsewhere. According to Patrick Conner, the original scribe who wrote the text probably did not write it as a single volume, but rather three separate manuscript booklets which were later compiled into the Exeter Book codex. There are a number of missing gatherings and pages. Some marginalia were added to the manuscript by the antiquarians Laurence Nowell in the sixteenth century and George Hickes in the seventeenth.

==Contents==
Aside from eight leaves added to the codex after it was written, the Exeter Book consists entirely of poetry. However, unlike the Junius manuscript, which is dedicated to biblically inspired works, the Exeter Book is noted for the unmatched diversity of genres among its contents, as well as their generally high level of poetic quality.

The poems give a sense of the intellectual sophistication of Anglo-Saxon literary culture. They include numerous saints’ lives, gnomic verses, and wisdom poems, in addition to almost a hundred riddles, numerous smaller heroic poems, and a quantity of elegiac verse. The moving elegies and enigmatic riddles are the most famous of the Exeter Book texts. The elegies primarily explore the themes of alienation, loss, the passage of time, desolation, and death, and deal with subjects including the sorrows of exile, the ruination of the past, and the long separation of lovers. Through them we encounter lonely seafarers, banished wanderers, and mournful lovers. The riddles, by contrast, explore the fabric of the world through the prism of the everyday. (See the sections on &#x27;Riddles&#x27; and &#x27;Elegies&#x27; below.) The Exeter manuscript is also important because it contains two poems signed by the poet Cynewulf, who is one of only twelve Old English poets known to us by name.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;the arrangement of the poems appears to be haphazard, and the book is believed to be copied from an earlier collection&quot;. However, whether (or the extent to which) the Exeter Book is a deliberately crafted anthology of related poems or a miscellany of unrelated poems is a matter of debate, as some degree of order has been found in the organisation of its contents.

None of the poems is given a title in the manuscript, and there is often no obvious indicator of where one text ends and the next begins, other than a plain initial. Consequently, the titles given to the poems in the Exeter Book are those that editors have established over the years, and very often a given poem will be known by several titles. The following is one listing of poems found in the book (titles may vary depending on source):
*&quot;Christ I, II, III&quot;
*&quot;Guthlac A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;
*&quot;Azarias&quot;
*&quot;The Phoenix&quot;
*&quot;Juliana&quot;
*&quot;The Wanderer&quot;
*&quot;The Gifts of Men&quot;
*&quot;Precepts&quot;
*&quot;The Seafarer&quot;
*&quot;Vainglory&quot;
*&quot;Widsith&quot;
*&quot;The Fortunes of Men&quot;
*&quot;Maxims I&quot;
*&quot;The Order of the World&quot;
*&quot;The Rhyming Poem&quot;
*&quot;The Panther&quot;
*&quot;The Whale&quot;
*&quot;The Partridge&quot;
*&quot;Soul and Body II&quot;
*&quot;Deor&quot;
*&quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot;
*Riddles 1-57/59
*&quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot;
*&quot;The Judgment Day I&quot;
*&quot;Resignation&quot;
*&quot;The Descent into Hell&quot;
*&quot;Alms-Giving&quot;
*&quot;Pharaoh&quot;
*&quot;The Lord’s Prayer I&quot;
*&quot;Homiletic Fragment II&quot;
*Riddle 28b / 30b
*Riddle 58 / 60
*&quot;The Husband&#x27;s Message&quot;
*&quot;The Ruin&quot;
*Riddles 59-91 / 61-95
==Riddles==

Among the other texts in the Exeter Book, there are over ninety riddles, written in the conventional alliterative style of Old English poetry. Their topics, which range from the religious to the mundane, are represented in an oblique and elliptical manner, challenging the reader to deduce what they are about. Some of the riddles are double entendres, setting out entirely innocent subject matter in language filled with bawdy connotations, such as Riddle 25 below.

Two Exeter Book riddles are presented below, with Modern English translations alongside the Old English originals. Proposed answers to the riddles are included below the text.

=== Riddle 25 ===

:Answer: &quot;an onion&quot;

=== Riddle 26 ===

:Answer: &quot;a Bible&quot;

== Elegies ==

The Exeter Book contains the Old English poems known as the &quot;elegies&quot;: &quot;The Wanderer&quot; (fol. 76b - fol. 78a); &quot;The Seafarer&quot; (fol. 81b - fol. 83a); &quot;The Riming Poem&quot; fol. 94a - fol. 95b); &quot;Deor&quot; (fol. 100a - fol. 100b), &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; (fol. 100b - fol. 101a); &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lament&quot; (fol. 115a - fol. 115b); &quot;The Husband&#x27;s Message&quot; (fol. 123a - 123b); and &quot;The Ruin&quot; (fol. 123b - fol. 124b).

The term &quot;elegy&quot; can be confusing due to its application to a diverse range of poems and poetic genres from different cultures and time periods. For example, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines elegy (in the poetic sense) as a poem either composed in the elegiac metre of Greek and Roman lyric poets, expressing &quot;personal sentiments on a range of subjects, including epigrams, laments, [and] love&quot;, or &quot;a poem in another language based on or influenced by this&quot; – hence, from this latter definition, the application of the term &quot;elegy&quot; to the Old English poems, which are not elegiac in their metre. More broadly, the term &quot;elegy&quot; has also been widened by some to include &quot;any serious meditative poem&quot;, a definition which would include the Exeter Book elegies. Providing a synthesis of the strictly metrical definition and the broader definition based on subject matter, Anne Klinck argues in &quot;The Old English Elegies&quot; that &quot;genre should be conceived [...] as a grouping of literary works based, theoretically, upon both outer form (specific meter or structure) and also upon inner form (attitude, tone, purpose – more crudely, subject and audience)&quot;.

<text>Henry Smith Pritchett (April 16, 1857 – August 28, 1939) was an American astronomer, university president and philanthropist.

==Biography==

Pritchett was born on April 16, 1857, in Fayette, Missouri, the son of Carr Waller Pritchett, Sr., and attended Pritchett College in Glasgow, Missouri, receiving an A.B. in 1875.

He then took instruction from Asaph Hall for two years at the US Naval Observatory after which he was made an assistant astronomer. In 1880, he returned to Glasgow to take a position at the Morrison Observatory, where his father Carr Waller Pritchett, Sr. was director. He served as an astronomer on the Transit of Venus Expedition to New Zealand in 1882. When he returned in 1883, he took an appointment as professor of mathematics and astronomy and director of the observatory at Washington University in St. Louis. In the early 1890s he studied in Germany, where he earned a PhD from the University of Munich in 1894. He was Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1897 to 1900. In 1899, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Pritchett served as the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1900 to 1906.

Pritchett was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901.

Pritchett was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1902. Pritchett later resigned, though the reasons and timing are unclear.

He was president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT) from 1906 until he retired in 1930. His principal accomplishment while with the CFAT was the institution of a fully funded pension program (the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, TIAA) in 1918.

He also served as the first president of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education (1907). He had a long involvement with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and served as a trustee for Carnegie Institute for Science.

He died on August 28, 1939, in Santa Barbara, California.

==Legacy==
Pritchett Lounge, on the second floor of the Walker Memorial building at MIT, is named in his honor.

<text>Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah (), (18 August 1875 – 11 December 1911) was King of Nepal. Among the most notable events of his reign were the introduction of the first automobiles to Nepal, and the creation of strict water and sanitation systems for much of the country.
King Prithvi&#x27;s eldest child was Princess Lakshmi, who was married to Field Marshal Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. She was made the Crown Princess and was heir to Nepal&#x27;s throne until she was 11, when her brother Tribhuvan was born. Until then King Prithvi only had four daughters and four from another wife.

While King Prithvi was kept at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace, his brothers, who were his closest allies and confidants were exiled to palaces across Nepal including in Palpa, Birgunj and Dhankuta from the Hanuman Dhoka Royal Palace, to prevent any repetition of attempts to regain royal prerogatives. Due to some of their increasing influence in state matters, fears of a coup arose and thus, movement restrictions imposed on the family became much more severe following the end of Prime Minister Bir Sumsher&#x27;s rule with Chandra Sumsher on the Prime Ministerial throne, especially in relation to getting an audience with their half brother King Prithvi at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace, Kathmandu. 

Much like his father Trailokya, King Prithvi also died under suspicious circumstances at a relatively young age, and his son Tribhuvan ascended the throne.

<text>William Procter (7 December 1801 – 4 April 1884) was an English-born American industrialist and candlemaker who was the co-founder of Procter &amp; Gamble Company in 1837, along with James Gamble.

==Early life==
A native of England, William Procter was born on 7 December 1801 in Herefordshire and educated at Lucton School. He entered into business in 1818 and was connected with the clothing industry in London in the late 1820s. His store was robbed and he was later mired in huge amount of debt. In 1827, he became influenced by William Hooper, who, through his admiration of, persuaded Procter to immigrate to America. He arrived in the United States in 1830 and began to manufacture candles in New York City. He moved west with his first wife, Martha Peat Procter. She died during their westward journey in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1832.

==Procter &amp; Gamble==
Planning only on staying for a short while before resuming his relocation plans, he decided to stay and spent the remainder of his life in Cincinnati. He started his business and, in 1833, married Olivia Norris, who was the daughter of a prominent candle maker in the city. At his father-in-law Alexander Norris&#x27;s suggestion, he joined forces in 1837 with his brother-in-law, James Gamble, to establish the company that bears their names. Both needed pig fat and Norris&#x27;s proposal allowed them to procure large quantities from suppliers at a lower cost. The company began to manufacture Ivory soap and profits grew to enormous proportions.

His son William Alexander Procter and grandson William Cooper Procter were company presidents.

Procter is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, as is his business partner, James Gamble.

<text>William Cooper Procter (August 25, 1862 – May 2, 1934) was head of Procter &amp; Gamble from 1907 to 1930 and was the last member of the founding families to lead the company.

==Biography==
He was born on August 25, 1862. He was the grandson of William Procter, the co-founder of Procter &amp; Gamble. He attended Princeton University and graduated in 1883.

Procter&#x27;s donation to Princeton University provided for the construction of Procter Hall. It is one of several Gothic buildings designed by Ralph Adams Cram to serve as the new Graduate College, Procter Hall is particularly noted for its Great West Window, designed by William and Anne Lee Willet. Today the building serves as the college&#x27;s formal dining hall and chief public space.

Procter joined the board of trustees for the Children&#x27;s Hospital in Cincinnati (now known as Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center). In 1921, Procter was elected president of the new board of trustees, a position he held until his death in 1934. Procter&#x27;s leadership and philanthropy led to an expansion in the hospital&#x27;s size, scope, mission and reputation. One of the board&#x27;s first acts was to change the hospital&#x27;s name from Protestant Episcopal Hospital to the Children&#x27;s Hospital.

A prestigious scientific research award by Sigma Xi society, the &quot;William Procter Prize&quot;, bears his name. Procter was awarded an elected membership in Sigma Xi in 1939 and he later endowed this award in 1950. This award recognizes outstanding contributions to scientific research and the ability to communicate the significance of the research to scientists in other disciplines. Past recipients of this award include Jane Goodall.
He died on May 2, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio, aged 71.

<doc id="769356" wikidata="Q859678" url="?curid=769356" title="Walk-off home run">
<text>In baseball, a walk-off home run is a home run that ends the game. For a home run to end the game, it must be hit in the bottom of the final inning and generate enough runs to exceed the opponent&#x27;s score. Because the opponent will not have an opportunity to score any more runs, there is no need to finish the inning and the team on defense will &quot;walk off&quot; the field while the player who hit the home run is rounding the bases. The winning runs must still touch all three bases and be counted at home plate. A variant of the walk-off home run, the walk-off grand slam, occurs when a grand slam exceeds the opponent&#x27;s score in the bottom of the final inning and ends the game.

==History and usage of the term==
Although the concept of a game-ending home run is as old as baseball, the adjective &quot;walk-off&quot; attained widespread use only in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The first known usage of the word in print appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on April 21, 1988, Section D, Page 1. &quot;Chronicle&quot; writer Lowell Cohn wrote an article headlined &quot;What the Eck?&quot; about Oakland reliever Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s unusual way of speaking: &quot;For a translation, I go in search of Eckersley. I also want to know why he calls short home runs &#x27;street pieces,&#x27; and home runs that come in the last at-bat of a game &#x27;walkoff pieces&#x27; ...&quot; Although the term originally was coined with a negative connotation, in reference to the pitcher (who must &quot;walk off&quot; the field with his head hung in shame), it has come to acquire a more celebratory connotation, for the batter who circles the bases with pride and with the adulation of the home crowd.

Jim Thome holds the MLB record for most career walk-off home runs with 13, the first being hit on June 15, 1994, and the last (which broke the previous record of 12) on June 23, 2012. Most notably, he hit his 500th career home run for a walk-off home run.

===Other types of &quot;walk-off&quot; wins===
Sportscasters have applied the term &quot;walk-off hit&quot; to any kind of hit that drives in the winning run to end the game. It is an expansion of the term to call a hit a walk-off when what ends the game is not the hit, but the defense&#x27;s failure to make a play. The terms &quot;walk-off hit by pitch&quot;, &quot;walk-off walk&quot; (a base on balls with the bases loaded), &quot;walk-off wild pitch&quot;, &quot;walk-off reach-on-error&quot;, &quot;walk-off steal of home&quot;, &quot;walk-off passed ball&quot;, and &quot;walk-off balk&quot; have been also applied, with the last dubbed a &quot;balk-off&quot;. The day after Eric Bruntlett executed a game-ending unassisted triple play for the Philadelphia Phillies against the New York Mets on August 23, 2009, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; used the term &quot;walk-off triple play&quot; in a subheadline describing the moment, although it was not a true walk-off.

===Walk-off grand slam===

A grand slam is a home run hit with all three bases occupied by baserunners (&quot;bases loaded&quot;), thereby scoring four runs—the most possible in one play. A walk-off home run with the bases loaded is therefore known as a walk-off grand slam. Since 1916 there have been more than 250 walk-off grand slams hit during Major League Baseball&#x27;s regular season. Since its institution in 1903, only two walk-off grand slams have been recorded in the postseason:

* In Game 2 of the 2011 ALCS, by Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers.
* In Game 1 of the 2024 World Series, by Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Additionally, in Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit a game-winning home run with the bases loaded against the Atlanta Braves, but as only the Mets player on third base – Roger Cedeño – reached home before the Mets started their on-field celebration, the play was officially recorded as a single.

Three players have hit two walk-off grand slams in a season: Cy Williams in 1926, Jim Presley in 1986, and Steve Pearce in 2017. Pearce&#x27;s first was on July 27 (an 8–4 victory over the Oakland Athletics) followed by his second on July 30 (an ultimate grand slam, for an 11–10 win over the Los Angeles Angels), becoming the first player in MLB history to hit multiple walk-off grand slams within the span of a single week.

====Ultimate grand slam====
A walk-off grand slam that erases a three-run deficit is also called an ultimate grand slam. There have been 32 such instances documented in major league history – all taking place during the regular season, 16 of those coming with two outs. Of the 32 home runs, only Roberto Clemente&#x27;s was hit inside the park, at spacious Forbes Field on July 25, 1956. Pirates manager/third base coach Bobby Bragan instructed him to stop at third, but Clemente ran through the stop sign to score the winning run. Del Crandall&#x27;s September 11, 1955, Alan Trammell&#x27;s June 21, 1988, and Chris Hoiles&#x27; May 17, 1996 grand slams occurred under the most dire situation possible: bases loaded, two outs, full count, bottom of the ninth inning, and down by three runs.

The most recent ultimate grand slam was hit by Giancarlo Stanton on September 20, 2022, in the New York Yankees&#x27; 9–8 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.

=== Walk-off celebrations ===
Walk-off celebrations typically consist of an entire baseball team leaving the dugout to meet a player at home plate after the batter hits a walk-off home run, or at whichever base the hitter happens to reach if a traditional base hit results in a walk-off victory.

A walk-off celebration may involve hitters jumping on home plate before being encircled and caught by their teammates. During a walk-off celebration on May 29, 2010, Kendrys Morales, then a member of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, broke his left leg from jumping on home plate while celebrating a walk-off grand slam off of the Seattle Mariners. As a result of this injury, team manager Mike Scioscia instituted new guidelines for his team that ensured a much tamer response to all subsequent walk-off victories.

==Relevant rules==
The rules of baseball provide that:
* A batter is entitled to a home run only &quot;when he shall have touched all bases legally.&quot; (Rule 5.05(a)(5); also 5.06(b)(4)(A))
* A batter is out, on appeal, for failing to touch each base in order or for passing a preceding runner. In some cases, all runs that score are negated. (Rule 5.09(b)(9), 5.09(c)(2) and 5.09(d))
* On a game-winning hit, a batter is credited for the full number of bases only if &quot;the batter runs out his hit.&quot; (Rule 9.06(f))
* A game-winning home run is allowed to complete before the game ends, even if it puts the home team ahead by more than one run. (Rule 7.01(g)(3), Exception; also 9.06(g))

The first point above was problematic in the 1976 American League Championship Series between the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals. The Yankees and Royals entered the bottom of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game with the score tied, 6–6; Mark Littell was the pitcher for Kansas City, and Chris Chambliss was the first batter for New York. Chambliss hit Littell&#x27;s first pitch into the right field bleachers to win the game and the American League pennant for the Yankees. However, Yankees fans ran onto the field at Yankee Stadium to celebrate the victory, and prevented Chambliss from rounding the bases and touching home plate. Recognizing the impossibility of Chambliss successfully negotiating the sea of people who had been on the field, umpires later escorted Chambliss back out to home plate and watched as he touched it with his foot, thereby making the Yankees victory &quot;official&quot;. (A comment to Rule 5.08(b) permits the umpires to award the run if fans prevent the runner from touching home plate.)

The third point above led to Robin Ventura&#x27;s &quot;Grand Slam Single&quot; in Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS. In the bottom of the 15th inning, the New York Mets tied the score against the Atlanta Braves at 3–3. Ventura came to bat with the bases loaded, and hit a game-winning grand slam to deep right. Roger Cedeño scored from third and John Olerud appeared to score from second, but Todd Pratt, on first base when Ventura hit the home run, went to second, then turned around and hugged Ventura as the rest of the team rushed onto the field. The official ruling was that because Ventura never advanced past first base, it was not a home run but a single, and thus only Cedeño&#x27;s run counted, making the official final score 4–3.

The fourth point above was not a rule prior to 1920; instead, the game ended at the moment the winning run scored. This rule affected the scoring of 40 hits, from 1884 to 1918, that would now be scored as game-winning home runs. Babe Ruth would have been credited with 715 career home runs had the modern rule been in effect in 1918; in a 10-inning game Ruth&#x27;s fence-clearing, walk-off RBI hit was scored a triple because the game was deemed over when the lead baserunner reached home.

==Other notable walk-offs==
==In fiction==
Although the term itself would not be used until over 100 years later, Casey at the Bat, an 1888 poem by Ernest Thayer, features a potential walk-off home run. Although pessimistic at first, the home team&#x27;s fans become more optimistic when their star, Casey, unexpectedly gets a chance to hit a walk-off three run home run. In the end they go home disappointed, however, when Casey strikes out rather than hitting the home run the fans expect.

<text>Fernando José Mendes Rosas (born 18 April 1946, in Lisbon) is a Portuguese historian, professor and politician, being one of the founders of the Left Bloc.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Rosas was born on 18 April 1946. He studied at Pedro Nunes secondary school, and in 1961, he joined the school&#x27;s Portuguese Communist Party organization, a party for which he was later a militant.

He entered University of Lisbon&#x27;s Faculty of Law where he remained an active militant. He was arrested in the repressive wave of January, 1965, while he was directing the student association of his Faculty. The Estado Novo arrested dozens of activists from the main board of student resistance. He was tried and convicted in 1965. He served one year and three months at a correctional facility. As he left this facility he dedicated himself to supporting activities for arrested politicians.

=== Political career ===
The events of May 1968, and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, in August of the same year, led him to opt for the abandonment of the Communist Party. He participated in Portugal&#x27;s first public protest against the Vietnam War, supported by sectors that were linked to the Students&#x27; Democratic Left-Wing, organization which he helped found in late 1968. It was as a politician responsible for this party that he organized the 1969 protests in Lisbon. He also participated in the second protest (this time centred on Coimbra).

In August 1971, he was arrested for the second time and taken to the headquarters of the PIDE political police. He was submitted to sleep torture for several days and then the regime&#x27;s courts convicted him to 14 months at a correctional facility.

Upon his release, he returned to anti-fascist activism. In March 1973, he actively supported the campaign for the accusation of the murder of African socialist politician Amílcar Cabral. After a renewed attempt by the PIDE to imprison him, he escaped and went &quot;underground&quot; until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974.

Rosas took part in the foundation of the maoist Re-Organized Movement of the Party of the Proletariat (MRPP) in 1970, along with figures such as Arnaldo Matos. Up to 1979 he was editor of the &quot;Luta Popular&quot; newspaper (&quot;People&#x27;s struggle&quot; in English). He represented this organization both times Ramalho Eanes ran for the presidency. During his time as a member of MRPP, Rosas was a candidate for Mayor of Lisbon in the 1976 local elections, getting 4,087 votes and 0.92% of the votes. He was later expelled from the party in 1980.After being expelled from MRPP, Rosas grew closer to the Revolutionary Socialist Party (PSR), led by Francisco Louçã, being a candidate from the party from 1985 onwards, as an independent.

In the 1996 presidential election, Rosas belonged to the Political Committee for the presidential candidacy of Jorge Sampaio.

In 1999, with Francisco Louçã from the PSR, Luís Fazenda from the UDP and Miguel Portas from Politics XXI, Rosas became one of the founders of the Left Bloc (BE), becoming the leader of its Permanent Commission. Following the same year&#x27;s legislative election, in which the Left Bloc entered Parliament by winning 2 seats, Rosas became a Member of the Assembly of the Republic from Lisbon.

Rosas was a candidate in the 2001 presidential election, being supported by the Left Bloc. He finished fourth, with 129,840 votes and 3.00% of the votes, being defeated by Jorge Sampaio, who was seeking reelection.

In 2002 he was the main candidate of the BE in Setúbal, failing to be elected. In 2005 he was once again the main candidate in Setúbal, this time being elected as a member of the Assembly of the Republic. Rosas was reelected in 2009, resigning to his seat in 2010 to dedicate himself to teaching and research as a historian.

=== Academic and journalistic career ===

In 1981, Fernando Rosas returned to University and began dedicating himself to journalism as a profession. He coordinated the history page of &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; and its cultural supplement. His collaboration with DN continued until 1992, a time when he integrated the fortnightly column of the pages of &quot;Público&quot;, another newspaper.
In 1986 he finished a Master&#x27;s Degree in Contemporary History (19th and 20th century), getting his Ph.D. in 1990.

Rosas served as the president of the Institute of Contemporary History (IHC) between 1994 and 2013, historical consultant for the Mário Soares Foundation and the director of &quot;História&quot; magazine between 1994 and 2007.

He was invited to be assistant professor by the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of NOVA University of Lisbon, becoming a cathedratic professor in 2003. After teaching his last lesson in April 2016, Rosas was invited as a guest to keep teaching History of Fascism. In 2019, Rosas became professor emeritus of the NOVA FCSH, the first person to receive that honour.

Rosas is a member of the Executive Commission of the Resistance and Freedom National Museum at the Peniche Fortress, where he was arrested during the Estado Novo regime.

<text>University of Hawaiʻi Kapiʻolani Community College, formerly Kapiʻolani Technical School, is a public community college in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. It is part of the University of Hawaiʻi System and accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.

==History==

Originally located at Pensacola Street and Kapiʻolani Boulevard (from which the school gets its name), adjacent to President William McKinley High School in the Makiki community, University of Hawaiʻi Kapiʻolani Community College was established in 1946 as Kapiʻolani Technical College.

The school was administered by the Territory of Hawaii as one of its chief vocational schools, specializing in food service. In 1965, its curricula was modified and became an open-door public college administered by the University of Hawaiʻi. As part of the realignment of programs, the school adopted its current name.

===Expansion===
Experiencing rapid growth in the 1970s, the Community College needed larger facilities. In 1974, the Board of Regents acquired a 52-acre (210,000 m2) parcel of land on the slopes of Diamond Head in Waikīkī, formerly owned by the United States Army. University of Hawaiʻi Kapiʻolani Community College opened its second campus at Fort Ruger, the only college in the University of Hawaiʻi System to have two campuses of its own.

The Board of Regents then agreed to move with a complete transfer of programs to the Fort Ruger campus and close the Makiki campus. University of Hawaiʻi Kapiʻolani Community College finally completed the transfer in the late 1980s.

==Points of interest==

<text>Vladimir Fyodorovich Promyslov (; 28 August 1908 – 22 May 1993) was a Soviet politician. He served as the Mayor of Moscow between 1963 and 1986 and was succeeded by Valery Saikin.

== Life and career ==
Promyslov was born in Kabuzhskoye, Kolomensky Uyezd.

A professional builder, Promyslov graduated from Moscow Construction Engineering Institute, and was appointed head of the Moscow construction department by Nikita Khrushchev. In 1963 he was appointed chairman of the Moscow Executive Committee, a position equivalent to that of Mayor. During his term the Ostankino Tower, the Rossiya Hotel, and dozens of new subway stations were built. In 1980 Moscow hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics, and several sport venues were constructed for it, among them the Luzhniki Stadium and the Olympic Stadium.

Promyslov also oversaw the completion of the administrative subdivisions reform, which divided Moscow into 20 raions. This reform is now considered unsuccessful and was reverted during the 1990s.

He died in Moscow, and was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.</text><links>

<doc id="769387" wikidata="Q8827" url="?curid=769387" title="Propertius">
<text>Sextus Propertius was a Latin elegiac poet of the Augustan age. He was born around 50–45 BC in Assisium (now Assisi) and died shortly after 15 BC. 

Propertius&#x27; surviving work comprises four books of &quot;Elegies&quot; (&quot;&quot;). He was a friend of the poets Gallus and Virgil and, with them, had as his patron Maecenas and, through Maecenas, the emperor Augustus. Although Propertius was not as renowned in his own time as other Latin elegists, he is today regarded by scholars as a major poet.

== Life ==
Very little information exists about Propertius outside of his own writing. His praenomen &quot;Sextus&quot; is mentioned by Aelius Donatus, a few manuscripts list him as &quot;Sextus Propertius&quot;, but the rest of his name is unknown. From numerous references in his poetry it is clear he was born and raised in Umbria, of a well-to-do family at or near Asisium (Assisi). His birthplace is generally regarded as modern Assisi, where tourists can view the excavated remains of a house thought to have belonged at least to the poet&#x27;s family, if not to the poet himself.

During Propertius&#x27; childhood, his father died and the family lost land as part of a confiscation, probably the same one which reduced Virgil&#x27;s estates when Octavian allotted lands to his veterans in 41 BC. Along with cryptic references in Ovid that imply that he was younger than his contemporary Tibullus, this suggests a birthdate after 55 BC.

After his father&#x27;s death, Propertius&#x27; mother set him on course for a public career, indicating his family still had some wealth, while the abundance of obscure mythology present in his poetry indicates he received a good education. Frequent mention of friends like Tullus, the nephew of Lucius Volcatius Tullus, consul in 33 BC, plus the fact that he lived on Rome&#x27;s Esquiline Hill indicate he moved among the children of the rich and politically connected during the early part of the 20s BC.

Propertius published a first book of love elegies around 30 BC, with the character &#x27;Cynthia&#x27; as the main theme; the book&#x27;s complete devotion gave it the natural title &quot;Cynthia Monobiblos&quot;. The &quot;Monobiblos&quot; must have attracted the attention of Maecenas, a patron of the arts who took Propertius into his circle of court poets. A second, larger book of elegies was published perhaps a year later, one that includes poems addressed directly to his patron and (as expected) praises for Augustus. The 19th century classics scholar Karl Lachmann argued, based on the unusually large number of poems in this book and Propertius&#x27; mention of &quot;tres libelli&quot;, that the single Book II actually comprises two separate books of poetry conflated in the manuscript tradition, an idea supported by the state of the manuscript tradition of &quot;Book II.&quot; An editor of Propertius, Paul Fedeli, accepts this hypothesis, as does G.P. Goold, editor of the Loeb edition.

The publication of a third book came sometime after 23 BC. Its content shows the poet beginning to move beyond simple love themes, as some poems (e.g. III.5) use &quot;Amor&quot; merely as a starting point for other topics. Book IV, published sometime after 16 BC, displays more of the poet&#x27;s ambitious agenda, and includes several aetiological poems explaining the origin of various Roman rites and landmarks. 

Book IV, the last Propertius wrote, has only half the number of poems as Book I. Given the change in direction apparent in his poetry, scholars assume only his death a short time after publication prevented him from further exploration; the collection may in fact have been published posthumously. An elegy of Ovid dated to 2 BC makes it clear that Propertius was dead by this time.

== Poetry ==
Propertius&#x27; fame rests on his four books of elegies, totaling around 92 poems (the exact number cannot be known as over the intervening years, scholars have divided and regrouped the poems, creating doubt as to the precise number). All his poems are written using the elegiac couplet, a form in vogue among the Roman social set during the late 1st century BC.

Like the work of nearly all the elegists, Propertius&#x27; work is dominated by a figure of a single female character, one he refers to throughout his poetry by the name Cynthia. She is named in over half the elegies of the first book and appears indirectly in several others, right from the first word of the first poem in the &quot;Monobiblos&quot;:
Whilst Apuleius identifies her as a woman named &quot;Hostia&quot;, and Propertius suggests she is a descendant of the Roman poet Hostius, modern scholarship indicates that the creation of &#x27;Cynthia&#x27; is part of a literary convention in Roman love elegy; &quot;scripta puella&quot;, a fictionalised &#x27;written girl&#x27;. Propertius frequently compliments her as &quot;docta puella&quot; &#x27;learned girl&#x27;, and characterises her as a female writer of verse, such as Sulpicia. This literary affair veers wildly between emotional extremes, and as a lover she clearly dominates the life of the poet&#x27;s voice at least through the publication of the third book:
It is difficult to precisely date many of Propertius&#x27; poems, but they chronicle the kind of declarations, passions, jealousies, quarrels, and lamentations that were commonplace subjects among the Latin elegists. The last two poems in Book III seem to indicate a final break with the character of Cynthia (&quot;versibus insignem te pudet esse meis&quot; - &quot;It is a shame that my verses have made you famous&quot;). In this last book Cynthia is the subject of only two poems, best regarded as a postscript. The bi-polar complexity of the relationship is amply demonstrated in a poignant, if amusing, poem from the final book. Cynthia&#x27;s ghost addresses Propertius from beyond the grave with criticism (among other things) that her funeral was not lavish enough, yet the longing of the poet remains in the final line &quot;inter complexus excidit umbra meos.&quot; - &quot;Her shade then slipped away from my embrace.&quot;

Book IV strongly indicates Propertius was planning a new direction for his poetry. The book includes several aetiological poems which, in reviewing the mythological origins of Rome and its landmarks, can also be read as critical—even vaguely subversive—of Augustus and his agenda for the new Rome. The position is currently a subject of debate among modern classicists. The final poem is a touching address by the recently deceased Cornelia consoling her husband Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus and their three children. Although the poem (given Cornelia&#x27;s connection to Augustus&#x27; family) was most likely an imperial commission, its dignity, nobility, and pathos have led critics to call it the &quot;queen of the elegies&quot;, and it is commonly considered the best in the collection.

Propertius&#x27; style is marked by seemingly abrupt transitions (in the manner of Latin neoteric poetry) and a high and imaginative allusion, often to the more obscure passages of Greek and Roman myth and legend. His idiosyncratic use of language, together with the corrupted state of the text, have made his elegies a challenge to edit; among the more famous names who have offered criticism of and emendations to the text have been the classicist John Percival Postgate and the English classicist and poet A. E. Housman.

== Textual problems ==
The text contains many syntactic, organizational and logical problems as it has survived. Some of these are no doubt exacerbated by Propertius&#x27; bold and occasionally unconventional use of Latin. Others have led scholars to alter and sometimes rearrange the text as preserved in the manuscripts.

A total of 146 Propertius manuscripts survive, the oldest of which dates from the 12th century. However, some of the poems in these manuscripts appear disjointed, such as I.8, which begins as a plea for Cynthia to abandon a planned sea voyage, then closes with sudden joy that the voyage has been called off. This poem has therefore been split by most scholars into a I.8a (comprising the first 26 lines) and I.8b (lines 27–46). More complicated organizational problems are presented by poems like II.26, a confusing piece in which Propertius first (1) dreams of Cynthia being shipwrecked, and then (2) praises Cynthia&#x27;s faithfulness. Following this, he (3) declares that she plans to sail and he will come along, (4) shifts to the couple together on the shore, and then (5) quickly has them back on board ship, ready to face the potential dangers of the sea. The images seem to conflict logically and chronologically, and have led different commentators to rearrange the lines or assume some &quot;lacunae&quot; in the text.

More modern critics have pointed out that all the proposed rearrangements assume Propertius&#x27; original poetry adhered strictly to the classical literary principles as set down by Aristotle, and so the apparent jumble is a result of manuscript corruptions. Another possibility is that Propertius was deliberately presenting disjointed images in violation of principles such as the Classical Unities, a theory which argues for different unifying structures in Propertius&#x27; elegies. This interpretation also implies that Propertius&#x27; style represented a mild reaction against the orthodoxy of classical literary theory. However, although these theories may have some bearing on issues of continuity in the other three surviving books of Propertius, modern philological scholarship tends toward a consensus that the extant text &quot;Book Two&quot; in fact represents the conflated remains of what were originally two books of poems. Recent editors of Propertius -- notably Paulo Fedeli (Teubner 1984); compare G.P. Gould&#x27;s 1990 revision of the Loeb text -- reflect these conclusions in their texts for &quot;Book Two&quot;, which show it as such a conflation of two books (the second and third of an original five), with some passages lost, parts of poems and whole poems combined, and possible shuffling of fragments. This case is well supported by the texts themselves and fits testimonial evidence about Propertius&#x27;s original publication of his work: first the &quot;Monobiblos&quot; (our &quot;Book I&quot;), then a collection of three books (our &quot;Book II&quot; and Book III -- the three-book elegiac format imitated by Ovid&#x27;s Amores) and lastly our Book IV, very likely posthumously.

== Influence ==
Propertius himself says he was popular and even scandalous in his own day. Horace, however, says that he would have to &quot;endure much&quot; and &quot;stop up his ears&quot; if he had to listen to &quot;Callimachus... to please the sensitive stock of poets&quot;; Postgate and others see this as a veiled attack on Propertius, who considered himself the Roman heir to Callimachus. This judgement also seems to be upheld by Quintilian, who ranks the elegies of Tibullus higher and, while accepting that others preferred Propertius, is himself somewhat dismissive of the poet. However, Propertius&#x27; popularity is attested by the presence of his verses in the graffiti preserved at Pompeii; while Ovid, for example, drew on him repeatedly for poetic themes, more than on Tibullus.

Propertius fell into obscurity in the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, he and Cynthia were summoned to a Love Assize but he was truly rediscovered during the Italian Renaissance along with the other elegists. Petrarch&#x27;s love sonnets certainly show the influence of his writing, and Aeneas Silvius (the future Pope Pius II) titled a collection of his youthful elegies &quot;Cinthia&quot;. There are also a set of &quot;Propertian Elegies&quot; attributed to the English writer Ben Jonson, though the authorship of these is disputed. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s 1795 collection of &quot;Elegies&quot; also shows some familiarity with Propertius&#x27; poetry.

Propertius is the lyrical protagonist of Joseph Brodsky&#x27;s poem &quot;Anno Domini&quot; (1968), originally written in Russian. His relationship with Cynthia is also addressed in Robert Lowell&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Ghost. After Sextus Propertius&quot;, which is a free translation of Propertius&#x27; Elegy IV 7. 

Elena Shvarts wrote a cycle of poems as if they were the works of Propertius&#x27; love, Cynthia. She explains Cynthia&#x27;s &#x27;poems have not survived, nevertheless I have tried to translate them into Russian&#x27;.

== Modern assessment ==
In the 20th century Ezra Pound&#x27;s poem &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot; cast Propertius as something of a satirist and political dissident, and his translation/interpretation of the elegies presented them as ancient examples of Pound&#x27;s own Imagist theory of art. Pound identified in Propertius an example of what he called (in &quot;How to Read&quot;) &#x27;logopoeia&#x27;, &quot;the dance of the intellect among words.&quot; Gilbert Highet, in &quot;Poets in a Landscape&quot;, attributed this to Propertius&#x27; use of mythic allusions and circumlocution, which Pound mimics to more comic effect in his &quot;Homage&quot;. The imagist interpretation, the poet&#x27;s tendency to sustain an interior monologue, and the deeply personal nature of his poetry have made Propertius a favorite in the modern age. In 1906 J. S. Phillimore presented a prose translation of Propertius, published by Oxford University Press. Three modern English translations of his work have appeared since 2000, and the playwright Tom Stoppard suggests in his best-known work &quot;The Invention of Love&quot; that the poet was responsible for much of what the West regards today as &quot;romantic love&quot;. The most recent translation appeared in September 2018 from Carcanet Press, and was a Poetry Book Society Autumn Recommended Translation. The collection entitled &quot;Poems&quot; () is edited by Patrick Worsnip with a foreword by Peter Heslin.

<text>Niemann–Pick disease (NP), also known as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is a group of rare genetic diseases of varying severity. These are inherited metabolic disorders in which sphingomyelin accumulates in lysosomes in cells of many organs. NP types A, A/B, and B are caused by mutations in the &quot;SMPD1&quot; gene, which causes a deficiency of an acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). NP type C is now considered a separate disease, as &quot;SMPD1&quot; is not involved, and there is no deficiency in ASM.

These disorders involve the dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids, which are fats found in cell membranes. They can be considered as a kind of sphingolipidosis, which is included in the larger family of lysosomal storage diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are related to the organs in which sphingomyelin accumulates. Enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) may cause reduced appetite, abdominal distension, and pain. Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia).

Accumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system (including the cerebellum) results in unsteady gait (ataxia), slurring of speech (dysarthria), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs, trunk, and face (dystonia). Upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements (supranuclear gaze palsy). More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures causes gradual loss of intellectual abilities, causing dementia and seizures.

Bones also may be affected, with the disease-causing enlarged bone marrow cavities, thinned cortical bone, or a distortion of the hip bone called coxa vara. Sleep-related disorders also occur with the condition, such as sleep inversion, sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night. Gelastic cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs, is also seen.

==Causes==

Mutations in the &quot;SMPD1&quot; gene cause Niemann–Pick disease types A and B. They produce a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, that breaks down the lipid sphingomyelin.

Mutations in &quot;NPC1&quot; or &quot;NPC2&quot; cause Niemann–Pick disease, type C (NPC), which affects a protein used to transport lipids.

Type D originally was separated from type C to delineate a group of patients with otherwise identical disorders who shared a common Nova Scotian ancestry. Patients in this group are known to share a specific mutation in the&quot; NPC1&quot; gene, so NPC is used for both groups. Before the molecular defects were described, the terms &quot;Niemann–Pick type I&quot; and &quot;Niemann–Pick type II&quot; were proposed to separate the high- and low-sphingomyelin forms of the disease in the early 1980s.

Niemann–Pick disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies or both alleles of the gene, must be defective to cause the disease. &quot;Defective&quot; means they are altered in a way that impairs their function. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers: they have one copy of the altered gene but are not affected because the other copy produces the enzyme. If both parents are carriers, each pregnancy has a 25% chance of producing an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of the disease.

==Pathophysiology==

Niemann–Pick diseases are a subgroup of lipid storage disorders called sphingolipidoses in which harmful quantities of fatty substances, or lipids, accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain.

In the classic infantile type-A variant, a missense mutation causes complete deficiency of sphingomyelinase. Sphingomyelin is a component of the cell membrane including the organellar membrane, so the enzyme deficiency blocks the degradation of lipids, resulting in the accumulation of sphingomyelin within lysosomes in the macrophage-monocyte phagocyte lineage. Affected cells become enlarged, sometimes up to 90 μm in diameter, secondary to the distention of lysosomes with sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Histology shows lipid-laden macrophages in the marrow and &quot;sea-blue histiocytes&quot; on pathology. Numerous small vacuoles of relatively uniform size are created, giving the cytoplasm a foamy appearance.

==Diagnosis==
For types A and B, levels of sphingomyelinase can be measured from a blood sample. To diagnose type C, a skin sample can help determine whether the transporter is affected via the Filipin test which detects build-up of unesterified cholesterol via fluorescent staining. 

===Classification===

The four types of Niemann–Pick disease are divided into categories. People with ASM deficiency are classified into types A and B. Type A patients exhibit hepatosplenomegaly in infancy and profound central nervous system involvement and are unable to survive beyond two years of age. Type B patients also show hepatosplenomegaly and pathologic alterations of their lungs, but usually without the involvement of their central nervous system. Some can develop significant life-threatening complications, including liver failure, hemorrhage, oxygen dependency, pulmonary infections, and splenic rupture. Some develop coronary arterial or valvular heart disease. In a longitudinal natural history study, nearly 20% of the patients died. For those classified into type C, they may have mild hepatosplenomegaly, but their central nervous system is profoundly affected.
* Niemann–Pick disease, SMPD1-associated, which includes types A and B
:* Niemann–Pick disease type A: classic infantile
:* Niemann–Pick disease type B: visceral
* Niemann–Pick disease, type C: subacute/juvenile, includes types C1 (95% of type C) and C2. Type C is the most common form of the disease Type C2 is a rare form of the disease.

Niemann–Pick disease type D (or Nova Scotia form) is now believed to be the same condition as Niemann–Pick disease type C. Two poorly characterized forms of Niemann–Pick disease have also been described as types E and F.

==Treatment==
In adults with type B, physicians try to keep cholesterol levels down to normal levels. If the spleen is enlarged and platelet levels low, acute episodes of bleeding may require transfusions of blood products. If they have symptoms of interstitial lung disease, they may need oxygen.

Possible treatments include enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. Bone marrow transplant has been tried for type B.

In January 2009, miglustat (Zavesca) was authorized in the European Union for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in people with Niemann-Pick type C disease. The medication is available to people in the United States on an experimental basis. In March 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested additional pre-clinical and clinical information regarding miglustat from Actelion before making a final decision on approving it in the United States for Niemann-Pick type C disease.

Olipudase alfa (Xenpozyme) was approved for medical use in Japan in March 2022.

Arimoclomol (Miplyffa) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024. It is the first medication approved by the FDA to treat Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C.

Levacetylleucine (Aqneursa) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024. Levacetylleucine is the second medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C.

==Prognosis==
Highly variable, infantile neurovisceral Niemann–Pick disease (type A ASMD) is usually fatal before 3 years of age. In Type B, severity is highly variable, and many patients live well into adulthood and may reach a normal lifespan. Diagnoses have been made in the 7th decade of life. 

Type C is an entirely different disorder, which also has a highly variable prognosis.

==Incidence==
The incidence among Ashkenazi Jews is estimated to be about one in 40,000 for type A of Niemann–Pick disease. The incidence of both Niemann–Pick disease types A and B in all other populations is estimated to be one in 250,000. The incidence of Niemann–Pick disease type C is estimated to be one in 150,000.

==History==
Albert Niemann published the first description of what now is known as Niemann–Pick disease, type A, in 1914. Ludwig Pick described the pathology of the disease in a series of papers in the 1930s.

In 1961, the classification of Niemann–Pick disease into types A, B, and C was introduced, and also contained a type D, called the &quot;Nova Scotian type&quot;. Genetic studies showed that type D is caused by the same gene as type C1, and the type D designation is no longer used.

== Research ==
Research has been ongoing to better understand the disease and treatments for it, however, at present, there is no cure. 

===Pathology===
The loss of myelin in the central nervous system is considered to be a main pathogenic factor. The research uses animal models carrying the underlying mutation for Niemann–Pick disease, e.g. a mutation in the &quot;NPC1&quot; gene as seen in Niemann–Pick type C disease. In this model, the expression of myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF) is significantly decreased. MRF is a transcription factor of critical importance in the development and maintenance of myelin sheaths. A perturbation of oligodendrocyte maturation and the myelination process might, therefore, be an underlying mechanism of neurological deficits.

Curiously, in 2011 fibroblast cells derived from patients with Niemann–Pick type C1 disease were shown to be resistant to Ebola virus because of mutations in the NPC1 protein, which is needed for viral escape from the vesicular compartment.

Other studies have uncovered small molecules that inhibit the receptor and may be a potential therapeutic strategy.

===Treatments under investigation===

====Experimental use of arimoclomol====
In 2014, the European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug designation to arimoclomol for the treatment of Niemann–Pick type C. This was followed in 2015 by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration. Dosing in a placebo-controlled phase II/III clinical trial to investigate treatment for Niemann–Pick type C (for patients with both type C1 and C2) using arimoclomol began in 2016.

====Experimental use of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin====
Researchers at the University of Arizona first proposed the use of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins for the treatment of Niemann–Pick Type C1 in 2001. Researchers noted that HPBCDs, with varying levels of 2-hydroxypropyl substitution, had effects in delaying neurological symptoms and in decreasing liver cholesterol storage in a Niemann–Pick mouse model. Later, researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found that when Niemann–Pick type C mice were injected with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) when they were seven days old, they showed marked improvement in liver function, much less neurodegeneration, and ultimately, they lived longer lives than the mice that did not receive this treatment. These results suggest HPbCD acutely reverses the storage defect seen in NPC.

In April 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases Program, announced they were developing a clinical trial using HPbCD for Niemann–Pick type C1 patients. A clinical trial conducted by Vtesse, LLC began in January 2013 and was completed in March 2017.

On 26 April 2013, the European Medicines Agency granted International Niemann–Pick Disease Alliance, the United Kingdom, orphan designation for HPbCD for the treatment of Niemann–Pick disease, type C.

====Gene therapy====

Gene therapy is being used clinically to treat genetic diseases, including hemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy. It has been used preclinically, in a mouse model of Niemann–Pick type C, using an adeno-associated virus-derived viral vector, and has been shown to extend lifespan following injection into the lateral ventricles of the neonatal brain. In a separate proof-of-concept study, a similar vector, but with a modified capsid, was injected intravenously into Niemann–Pick type C mice around four weeks of age; this resulted in extended lifespan and improved weight gain. Gene therapy has also been used preclinically in a mouse model of Niemann–Pick type A. Injection into the cisterna magna at seven weeks of age prevented motor and memory impairment and neuronal cell death.

==History==
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) states that &quot;The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) is a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the security of ships and port facilities, developed in response to the perceived threats to ships and port facilities in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the United States&quot;. 

Development and implementation were sped up drastically in reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks and the bombing of the French oil tanker &quot;Limburg&quot;. The U.S. Coast Guard, as the lead agency in the United States delegation to the IMO, advocated for the measure. The Code was agreed at a meeting of the 108 signatories to the SOLAS convention in London in December 2002. The measures agreed under the Code were brought into force on July 1, 2004.

== Appointed officers ==
ISPS Code demands that every ship must have a Company Security Officer (CSO) and Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) that will work alongside the Ship Security Officer (SSO) for security purposes. The CSO takes data from the Ship Security Assessment or Vessel Security Assessment to advise on possible threats that could happen on the ship. He will ensure that the Ship Security Plan (SSP) is maintained in an efficient manner by the SSO.
Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO) is an officer employed by the port and designated as responsible for the development, implementation, revision, and maintenance of the port facility security plan and liaison with the port authorities, Ship Security Officer (SSO), and Company Security, Officer (CSO).
The Ship Security Officer has full responsibility of the vessels security with the captain&#x27;s approval as stated in chapter XI-2/8. The SSO maintains the SSP and conducts regular security inspections to make sure that the appropriate security steps are always taken. The SSO also ensures that the security crew is trained for high security level purposes.

===Scope===
The ISPS Code states that it is the sole responsibility of the Company Security Officer (CSO) and Company to approve the Ship Security Officer (SSO). This process must be approved by the administration of the flag state of the ship or verified security organization with approval of the Ship Security Plan or Vessel Security Plan (VSP). The ISPS Code ensures that before the VSP is set in place that Vessel Security Assessments must be taken (VSA). The Vessel Security Plan must address every requirement in the Vessel Security Assessment. The VSP must establish a number of important roles and steps to provide safety for the marine vessel. Therefore, the VSP must include procedures to allow necessary communication that shall be enforced at all times. The VSP has to include procedures that assessed for the performance of daily security protocols. It also must include the assessment of security surveillance equipment systems to detect malfunctioning parts. ISPS code requires that the Vessel Security Plan must have strict procedure and practices for the vital protection of Sensitive Security Information (SSI) that is either in the form of electronic or paper. Observation of procedures has to include timed submissions, and assessments of security reports pertaining to heightened security concerns. ISPS code requests that the VSP maintain an updated inventory of dangerous or hazardous goods and substances that are carried aboard the ship. The location of the goods or substance must be stated in the inventory report.

The ISPS Code is implemented through chapter XI-2 Special measures to enhance maritime security in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).

Regulation XI-2/3 ensures that administrations establish security levels and guarantee the provisions of strict security level data to ships that fly their flag. Ships that are prior to docking in port must immediately comply with all requirements for security levels that are determined by that contracting government. This also pertains to the security level that is established by the Administration for that ship.

Regulation XI-2/6 makes sure that all ships are equipped and fitted with a Ship Security Alert System. The alarm system works from the ship to administration ashore with transmitted signals that are communicated via satellite. The advanced security alarm system shall send a signal indicating the ship name, location, and the security threat that the ship is undergoing. The ships alarm system may be activated from the navigation bridge by the captain without alarming the crew on-board.

The Regulation XI-2/8 establishes the main role of the Sea Master, which allows him to maintain order and conduct decisions for the sake of the personnel and security of the ship. Regulations XI-2/8 states that the Sea Master must not be challenged or withheld from completing his duties.

The Code is a two-part document describing minimum requirements for security of ships and ports. Part A provides mandatory requirements. Part B provides guidance for implementation. Some contracting governments have elected to also treat Part B as mandatory.

The ISPS Code applies to ships on international voyages (including passenger ships, cargo ships of and upwards, and mobile offshore drilling units) and the port facilities serving such ships. The Code does not apply to warships, naval auxiliaries, or other ships owned or operated by a contracting government and used only on government non-commercial service.

== MARSEC levels ==
Maritime Security (MARSEC) levels were constructed for quick communication from the ship to the U.S Coast Guard for different levels of threats aboard or ashore. The three security levels listed below are introduced by the ISPS Code.

MARSEC Level 1 is the normal level that the ship or port facility operates at on a daily basis. Level 1 ensures that security personnel maintain minimum appropriate security 24/7.

MARSEC Level 2 is a heightened level for a time period during a security risk that has become visible to security personnel. Appropriate additional measures will be conducted during this security level.

MARSEC Level 3 will include additional security measures for an incident that is forthcoming or has already occurred that must be maintained for a limited time frame. The security measure must be attended to although there might not be a specific target that has yet been identified.

Security level 3 should be applied only when there is reliable information given for that particular security threat that is probable or at hand. Security level 3 must be set for a timed duration for the identified security incident. Although the security levels will change from security level 1 to security level 2 and to security level 3, it is highly possible for the security levels to change drastically from security level 1 to security level 3.

==National implementation==
===Europe===
Europe has enacted the International regulations with EC Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, on enhancing ship and port facility security.

===United Kingdom===
The UK has enacted The Ship and Port Facility (Security) Regulations 2004, (S.I.1495 of 2004) these bring the EU regulation 725/2004 into UK law.

===United States===
The United States has issued regulations to enact the provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and to align domestic regulations with the maritime security standards of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. These regulations are found in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 101 through 107. Part 104 contains vessel security regulations, including some provisions that apply to foreign ships in US waters.

<doc id="769408" wikidata="Q1797795" url="?curid=769408" title="L. T. C. Rolt">
<text>Lionel Thomas Caswall Rolt (usually abbreviated to Tom Rolt or L. T. C. Rolt) (11 February 1910 – 9 May 1974) was a prolific English writer and the biographer of major civil engineering figures, including Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Thomas Telford. He is also regarded as one of the pioneers of the leisure cruising industry on Britain&#x27;s inland waterways, and was an enthusiast for vintage cars and heritage railways. He played a pioneering role in both the canal and railway preservation movements.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Tom Rolt was born in Chester to a line of Rolts &quot;dedicated to hunting and procreation&quot;. His father Lionel had settled back in Britain in Hay-on-Wye after working on a cattle station in Australia and a plantation in India, and joining (unsuccessfully) in the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. However, Lionel Rolt lost most of his money in 1920 after investing his capital in a company that failed, and the family moved to a pair of stone cottages in Stanley Pontlarge in Gloucestershire.

Rolt studied at Cheltenham College and at the age of 16 he took a job learning about steam traction, before starting an apprenticeship at the Kerr Stuart locomotive works in Stoke-on-Trent, where his uncle, Kyrle Willans, was chief development engineer. His uncle bought a wooden horse-drawn narrow flyboat called &quot;Cressy&quot; and fitted it with a steam engine. Then, having discovered that the steam made steering through tunnels impossible, he replaced the engine with a Ford Model T engine. This was Rolt&#x27;s introduction to the canal system.

=== Cars ===
After Kerr Stuart went into liquidation in 1930, Rolt became jobless and turned to vintage sports cars, taking part in the veteran run to Brighton, and acquiring a succession of cars including a 1924 Alvis 12/50 two seater &quot;duck&#x27;s back&quot; that he kept for the rest of his life.

Rolt bought into a motor garage partnership next to the Phoenix public house in Hartley Wintney in Hampshire. Its breakdown vehicle was an adapted 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Together with the landlord of the Phoenix, Tim Carson, and others, Rolt formed the Vintage Sports-Car Club in 1934. He also founded the Prescott hill climb. His 1950 book &quot;Horseless Carriage&quot; contains a diatribe against the emergence of mass production in the English car industry, claiming that &quot;mass production methods must develop towards the ultimate end [of automatic procreation of machines by machines], although by doing so, they involve either the supersession of men by machines or a continual expansion of production&quot;. His preference for traditional craftsmanship helps to explain his subsequent career.

=== Cressy ===
In 1936 Kyrle Willans bought back &quot;Cressy&quot;, which he had earlier sold, and several trips on the waterways convinced Rolt that he wanted a life afloat. He persuaded Angela Orred to join him in this idyll. She was a young blonde in a white polonecked sweater who had swept into his garage in an Alfa Romeo in 1937 and been caught up in the vintage car scene. Rolt bought &quot;Cressy&quot; from his uncle and set about converting her into a boat that could be lived on, the most notable addition being a bath.
During the summer of 1939 Rolt and Angela decided to defy her father&#x27;s objections and married in secret on 11 July. Work on &quot;Cressy&quot; was completed at Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard in Banbury, and on 27 July Rolt and his wife set off up the Oxford Canal.

=== War ===
The outbreak of the Second World War intervened and Rolt, a pacifist at heart, immediately signed up at the Rolls-Royce factory at Crewe to work on the production line of the Spitfire&#x27;s Merlin engine. He was saved from the tedium of the production line by the offer of a job in a bell foundry at Aldbourne in Wiltshire. The Rolts headed south in &quot;Cressy&quot; through storms, reaching Banbury a day before the canals were frozen over for the winter. 

In March 1940 the Rolts negotiated the River Thames in flood and headed up the River Kennet to reach Hungerford, near Aldbourne. Rolt then worked there for more than a year.

The Rolts&#x27; first four-month cruise was described in a book that Rolt initially called &quot;Painted Ship&quot;. He sent the manuscript to several publishers, but it did not find acceptance, as it was felt that there was no market for books about canals. It was not until after a magazine article he wrote came to the attention of the countryside writer H. J. Massingham that Rolt&#x27;s book was published, in December 1944, under the title &quot;Narrow Boat&quot;.

=== Inland Waterways Association ===
&quot;Narrow Boat&quot; had an immediate success with critics and public, leading to fan mail arriving at the Rolts&#x27; boat, which was then moored at Tardebigge. Two of the letters were from Robert Aickman and Charles Hadfield, who were both to figure prominently in the next phase of Rolt&#x27;s life, when he became a campaigner. He invited Aickman and his wife Ray to join the Rolts on &quot;Cressy&quot;. Aickman later described the journey with the Rolts as &quot;the best time I have ever spent on the waterways&quot;. It was on this journey that they decided to form an organisation that a few weeks later, in May 1946, at Aickman&#x27;s flat in London, was named the Inland Waterways Association, with Aickman as chairman, Hadfield as vice-chairman and Rolt as secretary.

The inland waterways of Britain were nationalised in 1947 and faced an uncertain future. The traditional life that Rolt had described seemed to be threatened with extinction. Rolt pioneered direct action on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, which stopped British Waterways from closing it; organised a hugely successful Inland Waterways Exhibition, which started in London but toured the country; and proposed the first boat rally at Market Harborough. Aickman, who had a private income, was working full time on the campaign, while Rolt, who had only his writing to support him and was still living aboard &quot;Cressy&quot;, struggled to meet all his commitments. Eventually he fell out with Aickman over the latter&#x27;s insistence that every mile of canal should be saved. In early 1951 Rolt was expelled from the organisation he had inspired.

By this time he had decided to bring his life on &quot;Cressy&quot; to an end and return to his family home in Stanley Pontlarge. Angela departed to continue the mobile life, joining Billy Smart&#x27;s Circus.

=== Talyllyn Railway ===
A letter Rolt had sent to the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; in 1950 resulted in the formation of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society, and he now threw himself into its activities, becoming chairman of the company that operated the railway as a tourist attraction. &quot;By the time the fateful letter terminating his IWA membership arrived, he was already busy issuing and stamping passengers&#x27; tickets from the little station in Towyn&quot;. His time at Talyllyn gave rise to his book &quot;Railway Adventure&quot; (1953), which became the basis for the Ealing comedy film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;.

Rolt married again, to Sonia Smith (&quot;née&quot; South), a former actress. During the war she had become one of the amateur boatwomen who worked the canals and had married a boatman. She had been on the council of the IWA. They had two sons, Tim and Dick, and continued to live in Stanley Pontlarge until Rolt&#x27;s death in 1974.

=== Author ===
Rolt became a full-time writer in 1939. The 1950s were Rolt&#x27;s most prolific time as an author. His best-known works were biographies of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, which stimulated a revival of interest in a forgotten hero, George and Robert Stephenson, and Thomas Telford. His classic study of historic railway accidents, &quot;Red for Danger&quot;, became a textbook for numerous engineering courses. Rolt produced many works about subjects that had not previously been considered the stuff of literature, such as civil engineering, canals and railways. In his later years he produced three volumes of autobiography, only one of which was published during his lifetime.

Rolt also published &quot;Sleep No More&quot; (1948) a collection of supernatural horror stories featuring ghosts, possession and atavism. These were modelled after the work of M. R. James, but used industrial settings such as railways instead of James&#x27; &quot;antiquarian&quot; settings. &quot;The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural&quot; described &quot;Sleep No More&quot; as &quot;An exceptionally original collection of ghost stories ... Rolt had the special talent of combining folkloric spontaneity with artful sophistication.&quot; Several of Rolt&#x27;s stories were anthologised; they were also adapted as radio dramas. His &quot;Winterstoke&quot; (1954) is a unique perspective on the development of modern Britain from the Feudal system via the dissolution of the monasteries.

==Achievements and honours==

Rolt was vice-president of the Newcomen Society, which established a Rolt Prize; a trustee and member of the Advisory Council of the Science Museum; a member of the York Railway Museum Committee; an honorary MA of Newcastle; an honorary MSc of the University of Bath (1973) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was a joint founder of the Association for Industrial Archaeology, which has an annual Rolt lecture. He helped to form the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust.

A locomotive &quot;Tom Rolt&quot; on the Talyllyn Railway, the world&#x27;s first preserved railway, was named in his memory in 1991.
Rolt observed the changes in society resulting from the industrial-scientific revolution. In the epilogue to his biography of Brunel he wrote, two years before C. P. Snow made similar statements about the split between the arts and sciences:

Men spoke in one breath of the arts and sciences, and to the man of intelligence and culture it seemed essential that he should keep himself abreast of developments in both spheres. ... So long as the artist or the man of culture had been able to advance shoulder to shoulder with engineer and scientist, and with them see the picture whole, he could share their sense of mastery and confidence, and believe wholeheartedly in material progress. But so soon as science and the arts became divorced, so soon as they ceased to speak a common language, confidence vanished, and doubts and fears came crowding in.
He set out these ideas more fully in his book &quot;High Horse Riderless&quot;, now seen by some as a classic of green philosophy.

A bridge (no. 164) on the Oxford Canal in Banbury bears his name (in commemoration of his book &quot;Narrow Boat&quot;), as does a centre at the boat museum at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. A blue plaque to Rolt was unveiled in at Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard, Banbury on 7 August 2010 as part of the centenary celebrations of his birth.

<doc id="769409" wikidata="Q29002562" url="?curid=769409" title="Sin Nombre virus">
<text>Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is the most common cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America. Sin Nombre virus is transmitted mainly by the eastern deer mouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;). In its natural reservoir, SNV causes an asymptomatic, persistent infection and is spread through excretions, fighting, and grooming. Humans can become infected by inhaling aerosols that contain rodent saliva, urine, or feces, as well as through bites and scratches. In humans, infection leads to HPS, an illness characterized by an early phase of mild and moderate symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, followed by sudden respiratory failure. The case fatality rate from infection is high, at 30–50%.

The genome of SNV is about 12.3 kilobases (kb) in length and segmented into three negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) strands. The small strand encodes the viral nucleoprotein, the medium strand encodes the viral spike protein, which attaches to cell receptors for entry into cells, and the long strand encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which replicates and transcribes the genome. Genome segments are encased in nucleoproteins to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are surrounded by a viral envelope that contains spikes emanating from its surface.

SNV replicates first by binding to the surface of cells with its envelope spikes. Virus particles, called virions, are then taken into the cell by endosomes, where a drop in pH causes the viral envelope to fuse with the endosome, which releases viral RNA into the host cell. RdRp then transcribes the genome for translation by host cell ribosomes and produces copies of the genome for progeny viruses. New virions are assembled near the cell membrane, where virions bud from the cell membrane and use it to obtain their viral envelope and leave the cell.

SNV was first discovered in 1993 when it caused an outbreak of disease in the Four Corners region of the US. This outbreak was historically significant since it marked the first time that pathogenic hantaviruses were discovered in the Americas as well as the discovery of HPS. Since its discovery, SNV has caused hundreds of cases of HPS in the US and Canada, where it is responsible for most HPS cases. Most cases of HPS caused by SNV occur in the western parts of the US and Canada.

==Genome==
The genome of Sin Nombre virus is about 12.3 thousand nucleotides in length and segmented into three negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) strands. The segments form into circles via non-covalent bonding of the ends of the genome. The small segment, about 2.06 kilobases (kb) in length, encodes the viral nucleoprotein and a non-structural protein that inhibits interferon production. The medium segment, about 3.7 kb in length, encodes a glycoprotein precursor that is cleaved into the two spike proteins Gn and Gc during virion assembly. The large segment, about 6.56 kb in length, encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for transcribing and replicating the genome. The ends of each segment contain untranslated terminal regions (UTRs) that are involved in the replication and transcription of the genome.

==Structure==

Virions are mostly spherical or pleomorphic in shape, with an average diameter of 112 nanometers (nm). They contain a lipid envelope covered in spike proteins made of the two viral glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. The spike proteins extend about 10 nm out from the surface and are tetrameric, consisting of four copies each of Gn and Gc with helical symmetry, in which Gn forms the stalk of the spike and Gc the head. Spikes are arranged on the surface in a lattice pattern. Inside the envelope are the three genome segments, which are encased in nucleoproteins to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Attached to each RNP complex is a copy of RdRp. For some SNV strains, virions may be roughly tubular in shape, with an average diameter of 85 nm and an average length of 180 nm.

==Life cycle==
SNV primarily infects endothelial cells and macrophages. It enters cells by using β3-integrins as receptors. Virions are taken into a cell via an endosome. Once pH is lowered, the viral envelope fuses with the endosome, which releases viral RNA into the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. The small segment is transcribed by RdRp first, then the medium segment, and lastly the large segment. Once the genome has been transcribed, RdRp snatches caps from host messenger RNA (mRNA) to create viral mRNA that is primed for translation by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins.

For replication of the genome, a complementary positive-sense strand is produced by RdRp. Copies of the genome are made from this complementery strand. Progeny RNA strands are then encapsidated by nucleoproteins. During replication, the glycoprotein is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum by the host signal peptidase during translation. This produces Gn at the N-terminus and Gc at the C-terminus of the protein. Spike proteins are expressed on the surface of the cell membrane. Viral RNPs are transmitted to the cell membrane where they bud from the surface, thereby obtaining their envelope as the new progeny virions leave the cell.

==Evolution==
The most common way that hantaviruses evolve is through mutations of individual nucleotides being inserted, deleted, or substituted. Because Sin Nombre virus has a segmented genome, it is possible for recombination and reassortment of segments to occur, whereby segments from different lineages mix in a single host cell and produce hybrid progeny. This has been observed for SNV in the US, mainly in exchanges of the S and M segments. Diploid progeny are also possible, in which virions may possess two of the same segment from two parent viruses.

==Ecology==

Sin Nombre virus is carried chiefly by the Eastern deer mouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;). Many other rodents, such as desert woodrats (&quot;Neotoma lepida&quot;), are considered to be dead-end hosts for SNV. The distribution of SNV closely matches that of its host&#x27;s distribution. The Eastern deer mouse is found throughout southern Canada, the continental United States except Alaska and most of the Atlantic coastal plain, and in Mexico throughout the central part of the country and in the Baja California peninsula. &quot;P. maniculatus&quot; mainly lives in rural areas, which mirrors where HPS cases typically occur.

In its rodent hosts, SNV causes a persistent, asymptomatic infection. The main sites of replication in deer mice are the heart, lungs, and brown adipose tissue. Rodent-to-rodent transmission occurs through contact with bodily fluids and through fighting and grooming. Transmission to humans occurs mainly through the inhalation of aerosols that contain mouse saliva, urine, or feces. Transmission can also occur through consumption of contaminated food, bites, and scratches. Antibodies to Sin Nombre virus have been detected in cats and dogs, but the role of these animals as hosts is unknown.

==Disease==

Sin Nombre virus infection usually causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), also called hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Symptoms occur within 1–8 weeks after exposure to the virus and come in three phases: prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and recovery. Prodromal, a.k.a. early, symptoms last for a few days and include fever, muscle pain, headache, coughing, nausea, vomiting, chills, and dizziness. The cardiopulmonary phase lasts for several days and is characterized by fluid buildup in the lungs, low oxygen levels in the blood, elevated or irregular heart rate, low blood pressure, cardiogenic shock, and respiratory failure. The case fatality rate from SNV infection is 30–50%.

SNV is the most common cause of HPS in the North America, and since its discovery there have been more than 700 identified cases in the US and more than 100 cases in Canada. In the US and Canada, most cases occur in the west. SNV infection is diagnosed based on observation of symptoms and testing for hantavirus nucleic acid, proteins, or hantavirus-specific antibodies. Treatment is supportive in nature and includes supplementing oxygen during the cardiopulmonary phase. No vaccines exist for Sin Nombre virus infection, so the main way to prevent infection is to avoid or minimize contact with rodents. Repeated infections of hantaviruses have not been observed, so recovering from infection likely grants life-long immunity.

==Classification==
Sin Nombre virus is classified into the species &quot;Orthohantavirus sinnombreense&quot;, which is named after the Sin Nombre canyon in California. &quot;Orthohantavirus sinnombreense&quot; is classified in the genus &quot;Orthohantavirus&quot;, which is classified in the family &quot;Hantaviridae&quot;, the family that all hantaviruses belong to. Other member viruses of the species include Blue River virus, Convinct Creek 107 virus, and New York virus. The NM R11 isolate of Sin Nombre virus is the exemplar virus of the species. This taxonomy is shown as follows hereafter:

*Family: &quot;Hantaviridae&quot;
**Genus: &quot;Orthohantavirus&quot;
***Species: &quot;Orthohantavirus sinnombreense&quot;
****Blue River virus, transmitted by the white-footed mouse (&quot;P. leucopus&quot;)
****Convict Creek 107 virus, transmitted by the eastern deer mouse (&quot;P. maniculatus&quot;)
****Monongahela virus, transmitted by the cloudland deer mouse (&quot;P. maniculatus nubiterrae&quot;), a subspecies of the eastern deer mouse
****New York virus, transmitted by the white-footed mouse (&quot;P. leucopus&quot;)
****Sin Nombre virus, transmitted by the eastern deer mouse (&quot;P. maniculatus&quot;)
*****Four Corners virus, a name given to the virus, an isolate of SNV, that caused the 1993 Four Corners outbreak

==History==

In 1993, an outbreak of highly lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in the Four Corners region of the United States. This outbreak was determined to be caused by a hantavirus, now named Sin Nombre virus, and represented the first confirmed instance of hantaviruses in the Americas as well as the discovery of a new type of disease caused by hantaviruses. The new disease was named &quot;hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)&quot;. In 2012, a small outbreak occurred at Yosemite National Park in California and claimed the lives of three tourists out of ten infected.
