<text>An incantation, spell, charm, enchantment, or bewitchery is a magical formula intended to trigger a magical effect on a person or objects. The formula can be spoken, sung, or chanted. An incantation can also be performed during ceremonial rituals or prayers. In the world of magic, wizards, witches, and fairies are common performers of incantations in culture and folklore.

In medieval literature, folklore, fairy tales, and modern fantasy fiction, enchantments are charms or spells. This has led to the terms &quot;enchanter&quot; and &quot;enchantress&quot; for those who use enchantments. The English language borrowed the term &quot;incantation&quot; from Old French in the late 14th century; the corresponding Old English term was &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, &quot;song, spell&quot;, cognate to ON galdr. The weakened sense &quot;delight&quot; (compare the same development of &quot;charm&quot;) is modern, first attested in 1593 (OED).

Words of incantation are often spoken with inflection and emphasis on the words being said. The tone and rhyme of how the words are spoken and the placement of words used in the formula may differ depending on the desired outcome of the magical effect.

Surviving written records of historical magic spells were largely obliterated in many cultures by the success of the major monotheistic religions (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity), which label some magical activity as immoral or associated with evil.

==Etymology==

The Latin &quot;incantare&quot;, which means &quot;to consecrate with spells, to charm, to bewitch, to ensorcel&quot;, forms the basis of the word &quot;&quot;, with deep linguistic roots going back to the Proto-Indo-European &quot;kan-&quot; prefix. So it can be said that an enchanter or enchantress casts magic spells, or utters incantations.

The words that are similar to incantations such as enchantment, charms and spells are the effects of reciting an incantation. To be enchanted is to be under the influence of an enchantment, usually thought to be caused by charms or spells.

==Magic words==
Magic words or words of power are words which have a specific, and sometimes unintended, effect. They are often nonsense phrases used in fantasy fiction or by stage prestidigitators. Frequently such words are presented as being part of a divine, adamic, or other secret or empowered language. Certain comic book heroes use magic words to activate their powers.

Examples of traditional magic words include &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, &quot;Alakazam&quot;, &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, &quot;Open Sesame&quot; and &quot;Sim Sala Bim&quot;.

In Babylonian, incantations can be used in rituals to burn images of one&#x27;s own enemies. An example would be found in the series of Mesopotamian incantations of Šurpu and Maqlû. In the Orient, the charming of snakes have been used in incantations of the past and still used today. A person using an incantation would entice the snake out of its hiding place in order to get rid of them.
===Udug-hul===

In Mesopotamian mythology, Udug Hul incantations are used to exorcise demons (evil Udug) who bring misfortune or illnesses, such as mental illness or anxiety. These demons can create horrible events such as divorce, loss of property, or other catastrophes.

==In folklore and fiction==

In traditional fairy tales magical formulas are sometimes attached to an object. When the incantation is uttered, it helps transform the object. In such stories, incantations are attached to a magic wand used by wizards, witches and fairy godmothers. One example is the spell that Cinderella&#x27;s Fairy Godmother used to turn a pumpkin into a coach, &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;, a nonsense rhyme which echoes more serious historical incantations.

==Modern uses and interpretations==
The performance of magic almost always involves the use of language. Whether spoken out loud or unspoken, words are frequently used to access or guide magical power. In &quot;The Magical Power of Words&quot; (1968), S. J. Tambiah argues that the connection between language and magic is due to a belief in the inherent ability of words to influence the universe. Bronisław Malinowski, in &quot;Coral Gardens and their Magic&quot; (1935), suggests that this belief is an extension of man&#x27;s basic use of language to describe his surroundings, in which &quot;the knowledge of the right words, appropriate phrases and the more highly developed forms of speech, gives man a power over and above his own limited field of personal action.&quot; Magical speech is therefore a ritual act and is of equal or even greater importance to the performance of magic than non-verbal acts.

Not all speech is considered magical. Only certain words and phrases or words spoken in a specific context are considered to have magical power. Magical language, according to C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards&#x27;s (1923) categories of speech, is distinct from scientific language because it is emotive and it converts words into symbols for emotions; whereas in scientific language words are tied to specific meanings and refer to an objective external reality. Magical language is therefore particularly adept at constructing metaphors that establish symbols and link magical rituals to the world.

Malinowski argues that &quot;the language of magic is sacred, set and used for an entirely different purpose to that of ordinary life.&quot; The two forms of language are differentiated through word choice, grammar, style, or by the use of specific phrases or forms: prayers, spells, songs, blessings, or chants, for example. Sacred modes of language often employ archaic words and forms in an attempt to invoke the purity or &quot;truth&quot; of a religious or a cultural &quot;golden age&quot;. The use of Hebrew in Judaism is an example.

Another potential source of the power of words is their secrecy and exclusivity. Much sacred language is differentiated enough from common language that it is incomprehensible to the majority of the population and it can only be used and interpreted by specialized practitioners (magicians, priests, shamans, or Imams). In this respect, Tambiah argues that magical languages violate the primary function of language: communication. Yet adherents of magic are still able to use and to value the magical function of words by believing in the inherent power of the words themselves and in the meaning that they must provide for those who do understand them. This leads Tambiah to conclude that &quot;the remarkable disjunction between sacred and profane language which exists as a general fact is not necessarily linked to the need to embody sacred words in an exclusive language.&quot;

<doc id="766723" wikidata="Q350807" url="?curid=766723" title="James Beattie (footballer)">
<text>James Scott Beattie (born 27 February 1978) is an English football coach and a former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is currently director of football at Southern League Premier Division South club AFC Totton.

He was previously a part of Garry Monk&#x27;s backroom staff, working with him at Birmingham City, Middlesbrough, Leeds United, Swansea City and Sheffield Wednesday.

Born in Lancaster, Lancashire, he came through the ranks at Blackburn Rovers, eventually signing professionally for them in 1995. Beattie then went on to have spells at Southampton, Everton, Sheffield United, Stoke City, Rangers, and a short spell on loan at Blackpool, before eventually returning to Sheffield United for a second term. When signed by Everton, and for his first spell at Sheffield United, he commanded the highest fee ever paid for a player by each club at that time.

==Early life==
Born in Lancaster, Lancashire, Beattie was a gifted pupil and attended the Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School. He was a very good swimmer, rated second in the country at the 100 metres freestyle at 14, but he dropped swimming in favour of football after damaging the cartilage tissue on his shoulder. 

He went on to represent his school, and play for Blackburn Schools, before joining Blackburn Rovers as a trainee on 7 March 1995.

==Club career==
===Blackburn Rovers===
He made his first-team debut for Blackburn Rovers in October 1996, in a 2–0 home defeat against Arsenal. He had made only seven first-team appearances, and had yet to score a goal, when, in the 1998 close season, he was transferred to Southampton.

===Southampton===
He joined Southampton in July 1998 valued at £1 million, as a make-weight part of the deal that took Kevin Davies to Ewood Park for a £7 million fee. Beattie&#x27;s initial impact was positive, earning him the club&#x27;s Player of the Season award as he helped the Saints stave off relegation. His second season was hampered by a series of injuries, but in November 2000 he began a long goalscoring run. After 18 months without a goal, he scored 10 in 10 matches, lifting Southampton into a comfortable position, and securing their place in the Premier League for the next season. His form then deserted him once again, and he scored only two goals during the remainder of the season.

Beattie was awarded a new four-year contract in March 2001. However, he failed to score in the remainder of the 2000–01 season, or in the first five Premier League matches of the next – a run that eventually totalled 17 matches. He returned to scoring form at the end of September 2001, and he ended 2001–02 with an impressive total of 14, despite a two-month spell on the sidelines, the result of an ankle injury which he sustained in a match against Manchester United in January 2002.

In 2002–03, Beattie scored 23 league goals, making him the third-highest Premiership goalscorer (and the highest English goalscorer) for that season. His fine form helped Southampton reach the 2003 FA Cup final, their first since victory in 1976. Southampton lost 1–0 to Arsenal and Beattie had to settle for a runners-up medal.

He eventually left Southampton in January 2005, joining Everton for a £6 million fee.

===Everton===
Beattie found it difficult to settle at Everton, and, in only his fifth Premier League appearance for the club, he was sent off for a headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas, leading to an automatic three-match suspension, and this, combined with a series of injuries, severely limited his contribution during what remained of 2004–05.

The 2005–06 season saw an improvement: Beattie was Everton&#x27;s top scorer, with ten goals in the Premier League and one in a 2–1 home defeat against Villarreal in the qualifying stages of the UEFA Champions League. Villarreal also won their own home leg 2–1, meaning Everton progressed no further.

During 2006–07, Beattie found himself peripheral to the plans of Everton boss David Moyes. He made 33 Premier League appearances, but 18 of them were from the substitutes&#x27; bench, and managed only two goals, the second of those coming in October, after which he failed to find the net again. Out of favour, it was reported that Blackburn Rovers were interested in signing him for a second spell, followed by news that Sheffield United were interested in securing his services.

===Sheffield United===
At the start of August 2007, Beattie signed for Sheffield United for a £4 million fee, this being the biggest transfer fee ever paid by Sheffield United. In the first match of the new season, he scored on his Championship debut for United against Colchester United, and then continued in fine form, scoring regularly, and was named Championship Player of the Month for August/September.

Beattie scored a total of 22 goals in the Championship in 2007–08. This made him the joint second-highest scorer in the division, alongside former Southampton teammate Kevin Phillips of West Bromwich Albion, and one behind Sylvan Ebanks-Blake (who scored 11 for Plymouth Argyle and 12 for Wolverhampton Wanderers). He was named as the Blades&#x27; Player of the Year at the end of the season.

In 2008–09, Beattie continued his goal-scoring form, scoring 12 goals before the turn of the year.

===Stoke City===
With Sheffield United trying to reduce costs, Beattie returned to the Premier League in January 2009, after signing for Stoke City on a two-and-a-half-year contract for a fee that could eventually rise to £3.5 million. He made an immediate impact, scoring his first goal for Stoke in a 3–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 27 January 2009. He went on to score seven goals in all for Stoke that season, helping them retain their place in the Premier League.

Beattie did not start 2009–10 very well: after a number of injuries hampered his pre-season training, he left the field of play against Chelsea on a stretcher after only 10 minutes, with fears of a suspected broken ankle. X-rays revealed ankle ligament damage. Beattie recovered, and won his place back in the team, surprisingly at the expense of a resurgent Dave Kitson, and had returned to scoring ways by October. However, a dressing-room altercation between Beattie and Pulis in December 2009 resulted in the striker falling out of favour.

===Rangers===
Out of favour at Stoke, Beattie signed a two-year contract, with the option of a further year, with Scottish Premier League club Rangers on 13 August 2010 for £1.4 million in the summer of 2010. became the club&#x27;s first permanent signing in two years due to financial constraints. Beattie made his debut for Rangers immediately after signing for the club, playing in their opening match in the Scottish Premier League against Kilmarnock.

Beattie did not feature much for Rangers, and was restricted to only five league starts in the first half of the season, due to injuries and loss of form. Unable to hold down a place in the team, he was allowed to join Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. He made his full debut on 5 February 2011, in a 5–3 defeat by his old club Everton, and went on to play nine times for the club, but failed to find the net as they sunk to relegation from the Premier League. At the end of August 2011, Rangers terminated Beattie&#x27;s contract.

===Return to Sheffield United===
In November 2011, Beattie began training with League One club AFC Bournemouth, with manager Lee Bradbury keen to sign him. However, later that month, Beattie moved north to train with old club Sheffield United to allow manager Danny Wilson to assess his fitness. A few days later, Beattie duly re-signed for Sheffield United on a short-term contract until mid-January 2012. He was quoted in an interview with the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; as saying that, &quot;if things go well, the gaffer says that he would like to keep me, and I would be interested in staying until the end of the season at least&quot;, prompting speculation that he could sign a longer-term contract. Despite this, Beattie had to wait to make a first-team appearance due to a calf injury sustained during training, eventually making his second debut for the Blades at the end of December 2011, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute against Notts County at Bramall Lane. 

By mid-January 2012, with Beattie&#x27;s contract set to expire, Danny Wilson confirmed that he would be offered an extension, hopefully keeping him at the club until the end of the season. With his future with Sheffield United still in doubt, Beattie was given a straight red card for violent conduct at Charlton Athletic, after only coming on as a substitute a few minutes earlier. Despite this disciplinary issue, it was agreed to extend his contract until the end of the season. Beattie was largely used as a substitute for the rest of his stay until he was released in May 2012 as Sheffield United failed to clinch promotion.

===Accrington Stanley===
Beattie joined League Two club Accrington Stanley on 9 November 2012 in a player/coach role. He made his debut on 16 November, when he came on as a 79th-minute substitute for Will Hatfield in a 1–1 draw at Barnet. On 20 November 2012, he scored a 9th-minute penalty in Stanley&#x27;s 3–1 win away at Fleetwood Town, ending a 1130-day run of not having scored in a first-team match. He scored another penalty in Stanley&#x27;s next match against Gillingham. Following the departure of manager Leam Richardson, Beattie expressed an interest in taking the position.

On 13 May 2013, Beattie was appointed Stanley&#x27;s new manager. He left Accrington by mutual consent on 12 September 2014.

==International career==
Beattie earned his first senior England cap in a friendly against Australia, on 12 February 2003, during his most successful season with Southampton. Australia won 3–1, and the result was described (by the Australian media) as &quot;one of the biggest upsets in soccer history&quot;. Beattie played the whole of the first half of the match, and was replaced at half-time by Francis Jeffers, who scored England&#x27;s consolation goal.

Beattie&#x27;s brief international career seemed to have come to a close when he was not selected for UEFA Euro 2004, the England team coach Sven-Göran Eriksson preferring Emile Heskey as the &quot;traditional&quot; centre-forward despite having scored five fewer goals than Beattie that season and fifteen fewer the season before.

==Coaching career==
On 13 May 2013, Beattie was appointed as Accrington Stanley&#x27;s new manager replacing Leam Richardson, but after 16 months in the post, Beattie left by mutual consent. He managed for 58 matches with a win ratio of 27.6%.

On 16 June 2015, Beattie was appointed as a first-team coach at Premier League club Swansea City, coaching the team&#x27;s forwards. He joined former teammate Garry Monk&#x27;s coaching staff. In December 2015, following Monk&#x27;s dismissal as manager, Beattie left Swansea City alongside Pep Clotet and Kristian O&#x27;Leary.

On 1 July 2016, Beattie rejoined Clotet and Monk at Championship club Leeds United as first-team coach. With Beattie a vital part of the backroom team, Monk&#x27;s Leeds side finished 7th in The Championship in 2016–17. On 25 May 2017, Monk resigned as Leeds United head coach, leaving behind his backroom staff at the club.

On 21 June 2017, Beattie followed Monk to newly relegated Championship club Middlesbrough as a first-team coach. On 23 December 2017, he was sacked along with Monk.

Beattie was appointed first-team coach of Championship club Birmingham City when Monk took over as manager in March 2018. After Monk was sacked, Beattie remained on the staff for a further season, albeit on &quot;gardening leave&quot;, and left in August 2020 after the arrival of Aitor Karanka as manager.

Beattie joined Sheffield Wednesday as assistant manager to Monk on 12 August 2020. When Monk was sacked on 9 November 2020, Beattie left with him after just three months at the club.

On 25 June 2021, he joined Wigan Athletic as assistant manager.

On 11 May 2024, Beattie was appointed director of football at non-league club AFC Totton.

==Personal life==
His time at Southampton was marred by a conviction for drink-driving in 2002, which led to a driving ban.

Beattie is married with three children.

<text>WaterAid is an international non-governmental organization, focused on water, sanitation and hygiene. It was set up in 1981 as a response to the UN International Drinking Water decade (1981–1990). As of 2025, it was operating in 30 countries.

The organisation was first established by the UK water industry on 21 July 1981 as a charitable trust at their main office premises in London and established its first projects in Zambia and Sri Lanka. In 2010, it became a Federation, comprising, , members in Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Sweden, the UK and the USA, and regional offices and country programmes in a further 23 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Activities involve providing people with clean water, safe sanitation, hygiene behaviour change and advocacy with governments and water utilities. Its income has moved from £1 million per annum in 1987 to £113 million in 2018–19.

==History==

WaterAid was founded in 1981 by members of the UK water industry at the Thirsty Third World conference held in London. WaterAid was formally established as a charity in the UK on 21 July 1981. King Charles III has been its president since 1991. Other members were established as follows: WaterAid America and Australia in 2004, Sweden in 2009. In 2010, the organisation became a federation and established the WaterAid International Secretariat. In 2014, WaterCan/EauVive, an NGO founded in Canada in 1987, became WaterAid Canada and joined the federation.

In 1993 WaterAid began work on its 1000th project and also agreed to fund the Hitosa Gravity Scheme in Ethiopia. The Hitosa scheme was the largest single water supply scheme implemented in Ethiopia at the time, reaching 50,000 people.

In 2003, WaterAid was named UK charity of the year at the Charity Times Awards. Also, in November 2006 WaterAid said that it was &quot;Britain&#x27;s most Admired Charity 2006&quot;, as voted by its peers in the voluntary sector (in &quot;Third Sector&quot; magazine). WaterAid came top of the category followed by Save the Children and The Samaritans. Andrew Cook, then WaterAid&#x27;s Director of Communications and Fundraising said &quot;We are delighted to have won this prestigious accolade. This award is a testament to the tireless work of all WaterAid&#x27;s staff and volunteers both in the UK and internationally&quot;. WaterAid was also a Stockholm Water Prize laureate in 1995.

In 2009, a new Global Strategy was launched, with the target of reaching 25 million more people across 30 countries by 2015. By 2011, WaterAid&#x27;s 30th anniversary year, they had reached almost 16 million people with safe water and over 11 million with sanitation. In 2015, WaterAid launched 2015-2020 Global Strategy and its mission is to transform lives of the poorest people by improving access to sanitation, hygiene and safe water.

In February 2022, WaterAid WaterAid launched its first legacy campaign, &quot;What Jack gave,&quot; concentrating on will donations. Legacy income currently accounts for approximately 10% of WaterAid&#x27;s total income.

== Fundraising ==

WaterAid has been associated with the Glastonbury Festival since 1994. In 2006 the festival&#x27;s founder Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily visited WaterAid&#x27;s work in Mozambique and by 2007 130 WaterAid volunteers helped at the festival. In 2011, there were around 200 WaterAid volunteers present.. In 2016, by which time there were over 500 WaterAid volunteers at Glastonbury, the charity introduced Talking Toilets which gave out information voiced by celebrities such as Cerys Matthews and Brian Blessed.

Among WaterAid&#x27;s many fundraising events is &#x27;Coast Along for WaterAid&#x27;, a sponsored walk along sections of the South West Coast Path, which took place annually between 2005 and 2012. In 2010 the then UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown took part.

In 2012, WaterAid partnered with Waterlogic to help raise funds for the poorest communities in the world, to provide them with clean and sanitary water. Waterlogic&#x27;s Firewall technology purifies water and destroys harmful bacteria. Waterlogic pledged US$225,000 to WaterAid over 3 years.

Fundraising events and initiatives in 2013 included The WaterAid200 Mountain Challenge as well as various running, cycling and other sporting challenges as well as Street fundraising.

Its twice-yearly magazine is called &#x27;Oasis&#x27; and includes news and features on planned and completed projects. WaterAid is a founding member of the End Water Poverty campaign calling for water and sanitation for all.

WaterAid America&#x27;s office runs several fundraising campaigns, notably the COVID-19 Response and No Water on the Frontlines, an appeal for essential workers around the world.

The organization also receives direct funding from a variety of corporations, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions. Notable donors include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Boeing, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Google, Mercy Corps, New Venture Fund, PepsiCo, Pfizer, USAID, and the World Bank Group.

==Activities==

WaterAid works in partnership with local organisations in 34 countries in Africa, Asia, Central America and the Pacific region to help poor communities establish sustainable water supplies and toilets, close to home, and to promote safe hygiene practices. It also works to influence government water and sanitation policies to serve the interests of vulnerable people and to ensure water and sanitation are prioritised in poverty reduction plans. As a matter of policy, WaterAid supports public ownership and control of water supplies but does not take a particular view regarding public, community or private participation in service provision.

===COVID-19 response===
In collaboration with Unilever, the Hygiene and Behavior Change Coalition (HBCC) extended its efforts to combat the Omicron and other COVID-19 variants. It maintained a steadfast commitment to implementing hygiene behavior change initiatives and promoting confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine.

During Phase 1 of the project, six countries, namely Ethiopia, Ghana, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Zambia, were chosen to receive mass handwashing facilities and hygiene essentials, benefitting a total of 152 million people. In Phase 2, Nigeria was designated for its prior involvement in promoting hygiene behavior change concerning COVID-19, supported by the Heineken Africa Foundation.

===Zambia===
WaterAid first started work in Zambia during the 1992-1994 drought. Since then, the organization has expanded its operations to seven districts in the country, five of which are in the Southern Province (Monze, Siavonga, Namwala, Itezhitezhi and Kazungula) while the other two are Kafue in Lusaka Province and Kaoma in Western Province. The organization spends about ZMK8-9 billion (just over £1 million) annually on projects there, and have since provided 42,600 people in Zambia with access to clean, safe water.

====Efforts in Monze District====

WaterAid is working with the government to help extend access to safe water, sanitation and improved hygiene for rural communities in Monze District. Sichiyanda is one such village in the Monze district where efforts are in progress. Projects in the village began in 2001 and the community worked together to dig a well with a dedicated bucket and windlass. Hygiene education is also taking place, where villagers are taught to keep areas clean by building dish racks and rubbish pits and ensuring that there are no stagnant pools of water where mosquitoes can breed. In addition, 28 latrines have already been constructed with more underway.

Such programmes have led to significant improvements in the lives of villages in rural Monze. The building of wells has led to time savings for women and children. For women, much of this newly available time has been put to productive economic activities like basket weaving and pottery making for use and sale. For children, it has led to increased attendance in schools. In light of this, WaterAid has since put up a tender request for an additional 32 boreholes (necessary for the construction of wells) to be drilled in Monze.

====Milenge Self Supply Project====

While most of WaterAid&#x27;s projects have been subsidized, the Milenge Project stands out for being one that is self-supplied. It has been possible to stimulate real demand in the district, and this means rural water supply upgrading can take place with no subsidy for materials. WaterAid is now working in four wards of Western Milenge on Self Supply, and 16 masons (4 per ward) have already been trained, having attended two separate one-month courses at Mansa Trades Training Institute. Besides being trained technically, these masons are also trained to work together and on how to promote their services. They speak to households independently, and some 95-well owners have since expressed interest in their services. Moreover, because these areas are some of the poorest in Zambia and the rural population is on average poorer than those in other piloting countries, such a response is truly impressive.

===America===
WaterAid becomes a global federation, opening offices in North America and Australia. WaterAid America&#x27;s office is in New York and manages programs in Latin America.

===India===
WaterAid India (Jal Seva Charitable Foundation) is a registered not-for-profit as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act of the Government of India. WaterAid India is determined to make clean water, decent toilets, and good hygiene normal for everyone, everywhere in the country. 

WaterAid started working in India in 1986 and since 2022, started working with communities in rural and urban areas through direct implementation. It is a full service organisation operating with a local board and diverse independent teams covering programme strategy and implementation, finance, resource mobilisation, policy and technical support, and human resource management. 

WaterAid India works closely with central, state, and local governments, individual and corporate donors, philanthropists, CSO partners, academics, and media. Thanks to its supporters and donors, they have reached millions of people with these three essentials – clean water, decent toilets, and good hygiene – enabling communities to unlock their potential to break free from the cycle of poverty and to change their lives for good. 

WaterAid India works closely in local communities to utilise low-cost technologies to deliver sustainable water supply, sanitation and hygiene solutions to the most vulnerable. WaterAid&#x27;s vision is of a world where everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

The organisation has grown in its significance in assisting the most marginalised in both rural and semi-urban areas. In the financial year 2023-24, WaterAid India covered over 11 states (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal), rendering their services to the communities that needed help most.

====Approach====

WaterAid India&#x27;s approach is to - 

* boost community empowerment and local skills to facilitate the creation, implementation, and management of enduring water security plans 
* employing diverse strategies including developing community-level water security and water quality models led by natural leaders and community members for sustainability 
* introducing processes like Jal Chaupal to enlighten communities on water budgeting and involve them in finding solutions, mobilising communities and strengthening mandated institutions such as healthcare centres, schools, and anganwadis 
* collaborating with relevant departments, offering technical support at local levels in both urban and rural communities 

WaterAid India&#x27;s projects advocate the use of safely managed sanitation and provide hygiene education with training manuals to the communities. To ensure programme sustainability, WaterAid India prioritises behaviour change and collaborates with communities to assess various sanitation options, enabling informed decision-making while considering the specific needs of children, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and the elderly in devising straightforward and durable solutions. 

Implementing a diverse set of practices, WaterAid India through its campaigns and community mobilisation - 

* addresses the sanitation chain ensuring safe management of human waste from containment and transportation to treatment and disposal or re-use, encompassing open defecation-free sustainability and solid-liquid waste management 
* establishes community cadres/collectives, ensuring the inclusion of persons with disabilities, women, and children in the process

====Achievements====

In the last five years, WaterAid India directly reached 32,61,586 people within 6,52,317 households with improved access to water and sanitation facilities. In 2022-23, WaterAid India has reached 2,60,383 people with access to clean and safe drinking water, 2,39,533 people were provided with access to safe sanitation, and hygiene education and best practices were imparted to 3,41,485 people.

The key highlights are - 

* The WaterAid project in Kalmandhai, Tiruchirapalli was declared the country&#x27;s first 100% sanitised slum in 2002. Khajapattai was announced as the seventh. 
* Since 2019, WaterAid India has been technically supporting the Madhya Pradesh state government under the Government of India&#x27;s flagship initiative Swachh Bharat Mission-Grameen (SBM-G). 
* The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation requested WaterAid India to demonstrate technology for easy disposal of faecal sludge, as well as chart the course ahead for SBM impressing the need for a plan for waste water management with particular emphasis on rural faecal sludge management (FSM). As a response to the Government’s demand for a faecal sludge disposal technology, WaterAid India designed, implemented, and constructed the maintenance model for an FSTP (Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant) in the Indore District. The Kali Billod FSTP is not only India’s first functional rural FSTP but is also a flagship FSM project in this region. 
* WaterAid India is part of the Rural WASH Partners Forum (RWPF), a platform created by the Government of India, under Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, to support States/UTs in for their flagship programme, Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) and Swachh Bharat Mission. The organisation is the sectoral lead for four thematic areas i.e. greywater management, gender, WASH in Institutions, and operation &amp; maintenance. 

===Bangladesh===
WaterAid started its work in Bangladesh in 1986. It has successfully collaborated with 21 organizations in Bangladesh up to now to alleviate the suffering from scarce water supply and low sanitation standards in poverty-plagued villages.

With WaterAid Bangladesh rendering their help in the technical field, The Village Education Resource Centre (VERC) introduced the community-led total sanitation (CLTS) model. It aims to educate villagers on the harmful effects that open defecation brings to the environment and their health. In addition, the CLTS programme helps to build toilets for the local communities to facilitate them in shifting to a more hygienic lifestyle. UNICEF recognized that the programme had been so impactful in Bangladesh that many organizations and countries had replicated it.

In 2011, the additional number of people who could access water and sanitation thanks to WaterAid&#x27;s programme is 259,000 and 536,000 respectively. WaterAid is currently working with the Bangladesh government to build the National Sanitation Strategy, which would help them to reach universal access to sanitation by 2015. Recognizing WaterAid&#x27;s efforts and the change that they made in running the National Sanitation Campaign together with other NGOs, the Bangladesh government presented the National Sanitation Award to WaterAid as a gesture of appreciation.

====Latrine design and construction ====

WaterAid encouraged local villagers to design and construct better latrines for themselves. This empowered people to be more involved and learn more about sanitation in the process. Furthermore, local participants could personalize it to fit their preferences and needs.

WaterAid also introduced a programme called &quot;Naming and Shaming&quot;, in which anyone caught defecating in the open would have their name taken down and made known to the whole community. Explaining why this works, Institute of Development Studies (University of Sussex) stated that it triggered people&#x27;s pride and felt so strongly that they were highly motivated to change, i.e. building their toilets and stop open defecation.

The Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (Switzerland) stated that 49 out of 80 unions had attained 100% sanitation coverage.

====Hygiene education====

WaterAid brought across the message of sanitation and hygienic defecation to the young by collaborating with a local music-theatre performance troupe that performed various educational for children. 
However, WaterAid does face some difficulties: almost unable to seek support and donations from companies in Bangladesh to ensure a high hygienic level. Mr. Mohammed Sabur, the Director of WaterAid Bangladesh said that since labour was abundant, companies were not afraid of labour shortage should their employees fall sick. The only companies likely to support the programme were those with benefits in mind such as Unilever, who wanted to sell more soap.

===Canada===

WaterCan/EauVive was established as a registered Canadian charity in 1987 by Michael Lubbock to &quot;help the world&#x27;s poorest people gain access to clean drinking water, basic sanitation and hygiene education&quot;. It works in 37 countries — like Bangladesh, Kenya, Nicaragua, and Uganda — by partnering with local organizations to assist the poorest and most marginalized communities. WaterAid Canada implemented sanitation projects benefiting 2.2 million people and safe water projects benefiting 1.7 million people by 2014. The charity also organized 4,000 education sessions focused on menstrual hygiene in Bangladesh. It receives funding through donations by individuals, organizations, and foundations and the Canadian International Development Agency. In 2013, it became a member of the global federation WaterAid, and was named WaterAid Canada in mid-2014.

<doc id="766729" wikidata="Q30504" url="?curid=766729" title="The Pastels">
<text>The Pastels are an indie rock group from Glasgow formed in 1981. They were a key act of the Scottish and British independent music scenes of the 1980s, and are specifically credited for the development of an independent and confident music scene in Glasgow. The group have had a number of members, but currently consists of Stephen McRobbie, Katrina Mitchell, Tom Crossley, John Hogarty, Alison Mitchell and Suse Bear.

==History==

=== Formation ===

The group formed in 1981 amid the peak of the Postcard Records era of independent music in Glasgow. Brian Taylor, a friend at the time of Postcard&#x27;s Alan Horne, recruited McRobbie, Hayward, and Simpson for his new band. The band first performed at Bearsden Burgh Hall, booked by McRobbie after he attended a Crass gig at the same venue.

The band released their first single, &quot;Songs for Children,&quot; on Whaam! Records in 1982, followed by their tape &quot;Entertaining Edward&quot; that same year on Action Tapes.

The band released a series of singles from 1982–1986, starting with &quot;Something Going On&quot; and B-side &quot;I Wonder Why&quot; in 1983. The latter record was later separately released by Rough Trade after McRobbie travelled to see Geoff Travis at the label&#x27;s office in London, where he insisted that they were &quot;the next big thing out of Scotland.&quot; The band then released &quot;Million Tears&quot; in 1984, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright With You&quot; in 1985, and &quot;Truck Train Tractor&quot; in 1986, all on other labels after their relationship with Rough Trade declined as the label focused more heavily on their other artists such as &quot;shinier new signings&quot; Scritti Politti and the Smiths.

These releases were published on a variety of labels including Whaam!, Creation, and Glass Records, and all had a raw and immediate sound, melodic and amateur, which seemed at odds with the time.

Despite their contrarian musical approach, they soon enjoyed an emerging fanzine culture identified with the group&#x27;s sound and image, and slowly started to influence a new wave of groups, as well as gathering the attention of NME and other UK media. Prior to their breakout album, the band appeared in a John Peel session, as well as a variety of zines. McRobbie at this period undertook a master&#x27;s degree in librarianship at Glasgow University, which would ensure the band remained rooted in Glasgow during their newfound fame.

The Pastels&#x27; sound continued to evolve and, although part of NME&#x27;s C86 compilation, in interviews they always sought to distance themselves from both twee and shambling developments.

=== &quot;Up for a Bit with the Pastels&quot; ===
Their debut album, &quot;Up for a Bit with The Pastels&quot; (Glass, 1987; re-issue Paperhouse, 1991) moved from garage pop-punk through to ballads with synth orchestra splashes. The album launched to industry praise, with praise from acts including Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, and Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain, but the record did not &quot;set the world alight&quot; as some had expected. In 2003, it was named the 37th best Scottish album by &quot;The Scotsman.&quot; The Guardian describe the album as integral in helping &quot;to inspire confidence in the Glasgow scene (showing) that bands didn’t have to move south but could let the record industry come to them.&quot; The album is attributed by the paper as attributable to the later release of Glaswegian output including Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Tigermilk&quot;, Mogwai&#x27;s &quot;Young Team&quot;, Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s self-titled arrival, and even Chvrches.

=== Departures and &quot;Sittin&#x27; Pretty&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s 1989 follow-up, &quot;Sittin&#x27; Pretty&quot; (Chapter 22, 1989) was harder but less eclectic. Reports started to appear in the UK music press that the group was splitting up, and Taylor, Hayward and Simpson all departed.

Eventually it became clear that a new line-up was configuring around original members, McRobbie and Wright (Aggi), now joined by Katrina Mitchell. This line-up is probably the best known of The Pastels&#x27; various phases, and often featured either David Keegan (of Shop Assistants) or Gerard Love (of Teenage Fanclub) on guitar. They signed with the then emerging Domino Records and completed two albums, &quot;Mobile Safari&quot; (1995) and &quot;Illumination&quot; (1997), with the musical approach of the latter described as &quot;mellowed and evolved into a form of gently psychedelic off-kilter pop, adorned with orchestral instrumentation.&quot; A remix set featured My Bloody Valentine, Jim O&#x27;Rourke and others on the album, &quot;Illuminati&quot; (1998). The band also featured that year on the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Acid House&quot;.

In 2000, Wright left the group to focus on her career as an illustrator though she still provides artwork for the group. Their next release was the soundtrack to David Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;The Last Great Wilderness&quot; (Geographic, 2003). It featured a track recorded in collaboration with Pulp&#x27;s Jarvis Cocker. In 2006 The Pastels developed and completed new music for a theatre production by Glasgow-based company, 12 Stars.

During the early 2000s the band continued to receive attention, particularly in Japan where they became &quot;incongruously wrapped up in the hype surrounding Britpop in Japan, jostling for position in magazines with the likes of Blur and Manic Street Preachers.&quot;

In 2009, The Pastels, in collaboration with Tenniscoats from Tokyo, Japan, released an album called &quot;Two Sunsets,&quot; which critics called &quot;a playful, spontaneous and spellbinding must-hear.&quot;

In 2013 they released their first album proper in sixteen years, &quot;Slow Summits,&quot; again through Domino. The Guardian described the album as &quot;their most complete set since Up for a Bit, with its 10 summery, groovy flute and french-horn-licked songs, trippy in the sense of the kind of trip that lands in a pile of freshly mown grass.&quot; The album was shortlisted for the 2013 Scottish Album of the Year Award.

The Pastels now operate their own Geographic Music label through Domino, and are partners in Glasgow&#x27;s Monorail Music shop.

The band features in the book &quot;Postcards from Scotland&quot; detailing the 1980s and 1990s independent music scene in Scotland.

<text>Bryant Winfield Culberson Dunn (July 1, 1927 – September 28, 2024) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 43rd governor of Tennessee from 1971 to 1975. He was the state&#x27;s first Republican governor in fifty years. Dunn was an unsuccessful candidate for a second term in 1986, losing to Democrat Ned McWherter. He remained active in the Republican Party and the medical field from the end of his term as governor until his death.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Meridian, Mississippi, the son of Aubert C. Dunn, an attorney and politician, and Dorothy (Crum) Dunn. Aubert served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives, 1935–1937. In 1944, during World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and served as a pharmacists&#x27; mate in the Asia-Pacific Theatre. He subsequently served as a reserve lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.

Dunn graduated with a B.B.A. from the University of Mississippi in 1950. That same year, he married Betty Prichard, the daughter of a Memphis dentist. The couple had three children: Charles (Chuck), Gayle, and Julie. After working in the insurance industry for several years, he obtained his D.D.S. from the University of Tennessee Medical Units in Memphis in 1955. He initially practiced with his father-in-law before opening his own practice in Memphis.

Inspired by Barry Goldwater&#x27;s views on conservatism, Dunn ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1962. He was elected Chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party, and as such campaigned for Goldwater in the 1964 presidential race. He was a delegate to the 1968 Republican National Convention, and campaigned for the eventual nominee, Richard Nixon.

==Governor==

In 1970, Dunn sought the Republican nomination for governor. His opponents for the nomination included Speaker of the Tennessee House William L. Jenkins, Nashville industrialist Maxey Jarman, former chair of the state party Claude K. Robertson, and the 1962 nominee, Hubert Patty. Boosted in part by a large turnout in his populous home county of Shelby, Dunn won the nomination, edging his nearest opponent, Jarman, by ten thousand votes. His opponent in the general election was John Jay Hooker, the Democratic nominee.

Prior to the 1970 election, Democrats had controlled the governor&#x27;s office for 50 years, and had largely dominated state politics since the end of Reconstruction. The GOP had last put up a candidate for governor in 1962. The social policies of the presidential administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, however, had alienated many Southern Democrats. Republicans began showing signs of life in the 1966 Senate race, when Republican Howard Baker Jr., defeated charismatic governor Frank G. Clement. In 1968, Nixon carried the state, Republicans won control of the state House of Representatives, and Republican Dan Kuykendall was elected to the Memphis-based 9th district congressional seat. With future federal judge Harry W. Wellford and future governor Lamar Alexander steering his campaign, Dunn defeated Hooker, 557,024 votes to 498,757, on election day.

Upon taking office, Dunn sought to unify the state, and offered state appointments to both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats, who controlled the state senate and had regained control of the state house, were initially uncooperative, with Speaker of the House James McKinney and Lieutenant-governor John S. Wilder (who was in the first term of what would become a 36-year tenure) trying at times to thwart his legislative agenda. In 1972, Ned McWherter was elected house speaker, and proved more open to cooperation with the Republican governor.

In spite of frequent Democratic opposition, Dunn managed to obtain a 0.6% increase in the state sales tax, allowing him to boost highway construction and give pay raises to state employees. He also created the Department of Economic and Community Development and the Department of General Services (to administer state purchases), and reorganized the Department of Personnel in an attempt to enhance efficiency in the hiring of state workers. Dunn supported the state&#x27;s ratification of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18, in 1971.

In November 1973, Dunn hosted the Republican Governors Conference in Memphis, where President Nixon, beleaguered by the Watergate scandal, privately assured the governors present that no more surprises would arise from the scandal that would hurt the party. In his 2007 book, &quot;From a Standing Start&quot;, Dunn recalled being &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;disappointed&quot; when a news broadcast on the following evening revealed there was an 18-and-half minute gap in the White House tapes.

==Later life and death==

Dunn&#x27;s term ended in 1975; at the time, the Constitution of Tennessee barred governors from serving consecutive terms. He returned to the private sector, working for several years as the vice president of public relations for the Nashville-based Hospital Corporation of America.

In 1986, Dunn once again ran for governor. He easily defeated Hubert Patty and Charles Vick in the Republican primary, but questions over party unity dogged his campaign. During his first term, Dunn had vetoed a bill calling for the establishment of a medical school at East Tennessee State University, reasoning that the state&#x27;s three existing medical schools were adequate. Though the legislature overrode his veto, he nevertheless drew the enmity of powerful 1st district congressman Jimmy Quillen, in whose district the school was to be located. Quillen was still smarting over the veto more than a decade later, and withheld his endorsement in 1986. Without Quillen&#x27;s endorsement, Dunn struggled in East Tennessee (normally a Republican stronghold), and was defeated in the general election by the Democratic nominee, Ned McWherter, 656,602 votes to 553,448.

After the 1986 campaign, Dunn focused on business and charitable interests. He worked as chairman of Memphis-based Medshares, and was a member of the boards of healthcare companies Phycor and Behavioral Healthcare Corporation. He was also active in the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority, as well as with various charities, including the American Cancer Society, the Nashville Heart Association, and the United Way.

During his post-governorship, Dunn remained an &quot;elder statesman&quot; in the state Republican Party. He was chair of the state steering committee of the presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush in 1988, and was an elector for George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008. In December 2011, he endorsed the eventual 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. Romney said of Dunn: &quot;No one is more highly regarded for his love of country and his public service.&quot;

Dunn died on September 28, 2024 from natural causes at his home in Nashville at the age of 97.

==Legacy==
The Winfield Dunn Center, built during Dunn&#x27;s tenure as governor, is home to the indoor athletic teams of Austin Peay State University. Buildings at Tennessee Technological University and the University of Memphis have been named for Dunn. The Dunn Dental Building, housing the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, is also named after Governor Dunn. The golf course at Pickwick Landing State Park in Counce, Tennessee is named for the former governor. A bust honoring the governor is in the clinic lobby of the Dunn Building.

Two state routes in Tennessee are named for him: Winfield Dunn Parkway, a section of State Highway 66, connects Interstate 40 with U.S. Route 441 in Sevierville, and a portion of Interstate 269/Tennessee State Route 385 in Fayette and Shelby Counties is named for him between US 70 and US 72.

<text>The Memphis Miracle was a 1994 meeting in Memphis, Tennessee, where representatives of Pentecostal and charismatic denominations and churches came together to form the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (PCCNA), an interdenominational and racially inclusive partnership. The PCCNA was created to replace the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America (PFNA) which was formed in 1948 by white Pentecostal churches, but excluded black Pentecostal groups. The PCCNA was created to remedy the situation, and it was at the Memphis meeting that the PFNA and its members apologized to the black Pentecostal bodies.

<text>Sarpang District (Dzongkha: གསར་སྤང་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Gsar-spang rdzong-khag&quot;; also known as &quot;Geylegphug&quot;) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. Sarpang covers a total area of and stretches from Lhamoizhingkha in West Bhutan to Manas National Park in the east. Sarpang Dzongkhag is divided into one dungkhag, Gelephu, and 12 gewogs.

==Languages==
The dominant language in Sarpang is Nepali, an Indo-European language spoken by the heterogeneous Lhotshampa community. The East Bodish Kheng language is also spoken in the northeastern reaches of the district.

==Administrative divisions==
Sarpang District is currently divided into twelve village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Chhuzagang Gewog
*Chhudzom Gewog
*Dekiling Gewog
*Gakiling Gewog
*Gelephu Gewog
*Jigmechhoeling Gewog
*Samtenling Gewog
*Senghe Gewog
*Serzhong Gewog
*Shompangkha Gewog
*Tareythang Gewog
*Umling Gewog
==Environment==
Much of Sarpang District consists of environmentally protected areas. Far western Sarpang District (the &quot;gewog&quot; of Senghe) contains part of the uninhabited Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary along the India border; northern Sarpang District (the &quot;gewog&quot; of Jigmechhoeling) is part of Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park; eastern and southeastern Sarpang District (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Jigmechhoeling, Tareythang and Umling) lie within Royal Manas National Park. Sarpang is bisected by a wide swath of biological corridor connecting all three environmentally protected areas.

==History==
On April 26, 2007, Lhamoy Zingkha Dungkhag (sub-district) was formally transferred from Sarpang Dzongkhag to Dagana Dzongkhag, affecting the town of Lhamozingkha and three gewogs – Lhamoizingkha, Deorali and Nichula Gewogs (Zinchula) – that formed the westernmost part of Sarpang and became the southernmost part of Dagana.

<doc id="766751" wikidata="Q1233121" url="?curid=766751" title="Pilgrimage of Grace">
<text>The Pilgrimage of Grace was a popular revolt beginning in Yorkshire in October 1536, before spreading to other parts of Northern England including Cumberland, Northumberland, Durham and north Lancashire, under the leadership of Robert Aske. The &quot;most serious of all Tudor period rebellions&quot;, it was a protest against Henry VIII&#x27;s break with the Catholic Church, the dissolution of the lesser monasteries, and the policies of the King&#x27;s chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, as well as other specific political, social, and economic grievances.

Following the suppression of the short-lived Lincolnshire Rising of 1536, the traditional historical view portrays the Pilgrimage as &quot;a spontaneous mass protest of the conservative elements in the North of England angry with the religious upheavals instigated by King Henry VIII&quot;. Historians have observed that there were contributing economic factors.

==Prelude to revolt==
=== The 16th century ===
During the Tudor era there was a general rise in the population across England, concentrated in the areas around Yorkshire. This led to a series of enclosures of once common lands. With this increased competition for resources, lack of access to once common land, and a greater pool of labour available, it led to an increase in the price of goods while also leading to a lack of employment and therefore increased unrest amongst the population. 

In 1535, the year preceding the revolt, bad harvests led to a series of grain riots in Craven in June 1535 and Somerset in April 1536 where grain prices were 82% higher than those in 1534.

=== Lincolnshire Rising and early riots ===
The Lincolnshire Rising was a brief rising against the separation of the Church of England from papal authority by Henry VIII and the dissolution of the monasteries set in motion by Thomas Cromwell. Both planned to assert the nation&#x27;s religious autonomy and the king&#x27;s supremacy over religious matters. The dissolution of the monasteries resulted in much property being transferred to the Crown.

The royal commissioners seized not only land, but the church plate, jewels, gold crosses, and bells. Silver chalices were replaced by ones made of tin. In some instances these items had been donated by local families in thanksgiving or in memory of a family member. There was also resistance to the recently passed Statute of Uses, which sought to recover royal fees based on land tenure. 
On 30 September 1536, Dr. John Raynes, Chancellor of the Diocese of Lincoln, and one of Cromwell&#x27;s commissioners, was addressing the assembled clergy in Bolingbroke, informing them of the new regulations and taxes affecting them. One of his clerks further inflamed matters regarding new requirements for the academic standards of the clergy saying &quot;Look to your books, or there will be consequences&quot;, which may have worried some of the less educated attendees. Word of his discourse and rumours of confiscation spread rapidly throughout Lindsey and soon reached Louth and Horncastle.
The rising began on 1 October 1536 at St James&#x27; Church, Louth, after Vespers, shortly after the closure of Louth Park Abbey. The stated aim of the uprising was to protest against the suppression of the monasteries, and not against the rule of Henry VIII himself.

Led by a monk and a shoemaker called Nicholas Melton, some 22,000 people are estimated to have joined the rising. The rising quickly gained support in Horncastle, Market Rasen, Caistor, and other nearby towns. Dr. John Raynes, the chancellor of the Diocese of Lincoln, who was ill at Bolingbroke, was dragged from his sick-bed in the chantry priests&#x27; residence and later beaten to death by the mob, and the commissioners&#x27; registers were seized and burned.

Angered by the actions of commissioners, the protesters demanded the end of the collection of a subsidy, the end of the Ten Articles, an end to the dissolution of religious houses, an end to taxes in peacetime, a purge of heretics in government, and the repeal of the Statute of Uses. With support from local gentry, a force of demonstrators, estimated at up to 40,000, marched on Lincoln and occupied Lincoln Cathedral. They demanded the freedom to continue worshipping as Roman Catholics and protection for the treasures of the Lincolnshire churches.

The protest effectively ended on 4 October 1536, when the King sent word for the occupiers to disperse or face the forces of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, which had already been mobilised. By 14 October, few remained in Lincoln. Following the rising, the vicar of Louth and Captain Cobbler, two of the main leaders, were captured and hanged at Tyburn.

Most of the other local ringleaders were executed during the next 12 days, including William Moreland, or Borrowby, one of the former Louth Park Abbey monks. Thomas Moigne, a lawyer from Willingham and one of the MPs for Lincoln, was hanged, drawn and quartered for his involvement. The Lincolnshire Rising helped inspire the more widespread Pilgrimage of Grace.

==Pilgrimage of Grace and the early Tudor crisis==
&quot;The Pilgrimage of Grace was a massive rebellion against the policies of the Crown and those closely identified with Thomas Cromwell.&quot; The movement broke out on 13 October 1536, immediately following the failure of the Lincolnshire Rising. Only then was the term &#x27;Pilgrimage of Grace&#x27; used. Historians have identified several key themes of the revolt:

===Economic===
The northern gentry had concerns over the new Statute of Uses. The poor harvest of 1535 had also led to high food prices, which likely contributed to discontent. The dissolution of the monasteries also affected the local poor, many of whom relied on them for food and shelter. Henry VIII was also in the habit of raising more funds for the crown through taxation, confiscation of lands, and depreciating the value of goods. A great deal of the taxation was levied against property and income, especially in the areas around Cumberland and Westmoreland where accounts of extortionate rents and gressums, a payment made to the crown when taking up a tenancy through inheritance, sale, or entry fines, were becoming more and more common.

===Political===
Many people in England disliked the way in which Henry VIII had cast off his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Although her successor, Anne Boleyn, had been unpopular as Catherine&#x27;s replacement as a rumoured Protestant, her execution in 1536 on charges of adultery and treason had done much to undermine the monarchy&#x27;s prestige and the King&#x27;s personal reputation. Aristocrats objected to the rise of Thomas Cromwell, who was &quot;base born&quot;.

===Religious===
The local church was, for many in the north, the centre of community life. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptisms might be taxed. The recently released Ten Articles and the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more Protestant, which went against the Catholic beliefs of most northerners.

==Events==

Robert Aske was chosen to lead the insurgents; he was a barrister from London, a resident of the Inns of Court, and the youngest son of Sir Robert Aske of Aughton, near Selby. His family was from Aske Hall, Richmondshire, and had long been in Yorkshire. In 1536, Aske led a band of 9,000 followers, each of whom had sworn the Oath of the Honourable Men, who entered and occupied York. He arranged for expelled monks and nuns to return to their houses; the King&#x27;s newly installed tenants were driven out, and Catholic observances were resumed. When the King learnt that the monks had restored Sawley Abbey, he ordered Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby to &quot;take the said abbot and monks forth with violence and have them hanged without delay in their monks’ apparel&quot;.

However, the rising was so successful that the royalist leaders, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, opened negotiations with the insurgents at Scawsby Leys, near Doncaster, where Aske had assembled between 30,000 and 40,000 people.

In early December 1536, the Pilgrimage of Grace gathered at Pontefract Castle to draft a petition to be presented to King Henry VIII with a list of their demands. The 24 Articles to the King, also called &quot;The Commons&#x27; Petition&quot;, was given to the Duke of Norfolk to present to the king. The Duke promised to do so, and also promised a general pardon and a Parliament to be held at York within a year, as well as a reprieve for the abbeys until the Parliament had met. Accepting the promises, Aske dismissed his followers and the pilgrimage disbanded.

Jesse Childs (a biographer of the Earl of Surrey, Norfolk&#x27;s son) specifically notes that Henry VIII did not authorize Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, to grant remedies for the grievances. Norfolk&#x27;s enemies had whispered into the King&#x27;s ear that the Howards could put down a rebellion of peasants if they wanted to, suggesting that Norfolk sympathized with the Pilgrimage. Norfolk and the Earl of Shrewsbury were outnumbered: they had 5000 and 7000 respectively but there were 40,000 pilgrims. Upon seeing their vast numbers, Norfolk negotiated and made promises to avoid being massacred.

==Suppression==

In February 1537 there was a new rising (not authorised by Aske) in Cumberland and Westmorland, called Bigod&#x27;s Rebellion, under Sir Francis Bigod, of Settrington in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Because he knew the promises he made on behalf of the King would not be met, Norfolk reacted quickly to the new uprising after the Pilgrims did not disperse as they had promised.

The rebellion failed and King Henry VIII arrested Bigod, Aske, and several other rebels, such as Darcy, John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, the Chief Butler of England; Sir Thomas Percy, and Sir Robert Constable. All were convicted of treason and executed. During 1537 Bigod was hanged at Tyburn; Lords Darcy and Hussey both beheaded; Thomas Moigne, M.P. for Lincoln was hanged, drawn, and quartered; Sir Robert Constable hanged in chains at Hull; and Robert Aske hanged in chains at York. In total 216 were executed: several lords and knights (including Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Stephen Hamerton, Sir William Lumley, Sir John Constable, and Sir William Constable), 7 abbots (Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx, William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley, John Paslew, Abbot of Whalley, Matthew Mackarel, Abbot of Barlings and Bishop of Chalcedon, William Thirsk, Abbot of Fountains and the Prior of Bridlington), 38 monks, and 16 parish priests. Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, was hanged at Tyburn, Sir John Bulmer hanged, drawn, and quartered and his wife Margaret Stafford burnt at the stake.

In late 1538, Sir Edward Neville, Keeper of the Sewer (official overseeing service), was beheaded. The loss of the leaders enabled the Duke of Norfolk to quell the rising, and martial law was imposed upon the demonstrating regions. Norfolk executed some 216 activists (such as Lord Darcy, who tried to implicate Norfolk as a sympathizer): churchmen, monks, commoners.

The details of the trial and execution of major leaders were recorded by the author of &quot;Wriothesley&#x27;s Chronicle:&quot;

Also the 16-day of May [1537] there were arraigned at Westminster afore the King’s Commissioners, the Lord Chancellor that day being the chief, these persons following: Sir Robert Constable, knight; Sir Thomas Percy, knight, and brother to the Earl of Northumberland; Sir John Bulmer, knight, and Ralph Bulmer, his son and heir; Sir Francis Bigod, knight; Margaret Cheney, after Lady Bulmer by untrue matrimony; George Lumley, esquire; Robert Aske, gentleman, that was captain in the insurrection of the Northern men; and one Hamerton, esquire, all which persons were indicted of high treason against the King, and that day condemned by a jury of knights and esquires for the same, whereupon they had sentence to be drawn, hanged and quartered, but Ralph Bulmer, the son of John Bulmer, was reprieved and had no sentence.

And on the 25-day of May, being the Friday in Whitsun week, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamerton, knights, were hanged and headed; Nicholas Tempest, esquire; Doctor Cockerell, priest; Abbot quondam of Fountains; and Doctor Pickering, friar, were drawn from the Tower of London to Tyburn, and there hanged, bowelled and quartered, and their heads set on London Bridge and divers gates in London.

And the same day Margaret Cheney, &#x27;other wife to Bulmer called&#x27;, was drawn after them from the Tower of London into Smithfield, and there burned according to her judgment, God pardon her soul, being the Friday in Whitsun week; she was a very fair creature, and a beautiful.

==Outcome==

===Failures===
The Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace have historically been seen as failures for the following reasons:

* England was not reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church, except during the brief reign of Mary I (1553–1558).
* The dissolution of the monasteries continued unabated, with the largest monasteries being dissolved by 1540.
* Great tracts of land were seized from the Church and divided among the Crown and its supporters.
* The steps towards official Protestantism achieved by Cromwell continued, except during the reign of Mary I.

===Successes===
Their partial successes are less known:

* The government postponed the collection of the October subsidy, a major grievance amongst the Lincolnshire organisations.
* The Statute of Uses was partially negated by a new law, the Statute of Wills.
* Four of the seven sacraments that were omitted from the Ten Articles were restored in the Bishop&#x27;s Book of 1537, which marked the end of the drift of official doctrine towards Protestantism. The Bishop&#x27;s Book was followed by the Six Articles of 1539.
* An onslaught upon heresy was promised in a royal proclamation in 1538.

==Leadership==
Historians have noted the leaders among the nobility and gentry in the Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace and tend to argue that the Risings gained legitimacy only through the involvement of the northern nobility and gentlemen, such as Lord Darcy, Lord Hussey and Robert Aske. However, historians such as M. E. James, C. S. L. Davies and Andy Wood, among others, believe the question of leadership was more complex.

James and Davies look at the Risings of 1536 as the product of common grievances. The lower classes were aggrieved because of the closure of local monasteries by the Act of Suppression. The northern nobility felt their rights were being taken away from them in the Acts of 1535–1536, which made them lose confidence in the royal government. James analysed how the lower classes and the nobility used each other as a legitimizing force in an extremely ordered society.

The nobles hid behind the force of the lower classes with claims of coercion, since they were seen as blameless for their actions because they did not possess political choice. This allowed the nobles an arena to air their grievances while, at the same time, playing the victims of popular violence. The lower classes used the nobility to give their grievance a sense of obedience since the &quot;leaders&quot; of the rebellion were of a higher social class.

Davies considers the leadership of the 1536 Risings as more of a cohesion. Common grievances over evil advisors and religion brought the higher and lower classes together in their fight. Once the nobles had to confront the King&#x27;s forces and an all-out war, they decided to surrender, thereby ending the cohesion.

Historian Andy Wood, representing social historians of the late 20th century who have found more agency among the lower classes, argues that the commons were the effective force behind the Risings. He argues that this force came from a class group largely left out of history: minor gentlemen and well-off farmers. He believes these groups were the leaders of the Risings because they had more political agency and thought.

<text>Alexey Fyodorovich Zubov () (1682–c.1741) was a Russian etcher.

Zubov and his brother Ivan were accepted as apprentices to their father Fyodor in the Kremlin icon shop at an early age. In 1699 Alexey was apprenticed to the Dutch etcher Adriaan Schoonebeek by the order of Peter the Great.

His etchings of important events, people and monuments of the Tsar&#x27;s Russia earned him great fame in his own lifetime. The year of his death is unknown, but believed to be on or after 1750.

<doc id="766756" wikidata="Q1538364" url="?curid=766756" title="Gorlois">
<text>In Arthurian legend, Gorlois () of Tintagel was the Duke of Cornwall. He was the first husband of King Arthur&#x27;s mother Igraine and the father of her daughters, Arthur&#x27;s half-sisters. Her second husband was Uther Pendragon, the High King of Britain and Arthur&#x27;s father, who marries her after killing him.

==Names==
The name Gorlois first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (). &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; calls him Rica. The Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Of Arthour and of Merlin&quot; call him Duke Hoel (Höel) of Tintagel, the latter text describing him as Igraine&#x27;s second husband but also prior to her marriage with Uther. In &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, he appears as King Goloé (Golaas). William Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Itineraries&quot; call him Tador.

==Legend==
According to &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Gorlois was vassal of Ambrosius Aurelianus, whose arrival at the Battle of Kaerconan ensured the defeat of Hengist. In Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, when Hengist&#x27;s son Octa and his cousin Ossa rebel, Gorlois helps Uther defeat them at York. In the &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot;, a Welsh version of Geoffrey&#x27;s work, Gorlois is the father of Cador, Duke of Cornwall, presumably by Igraine. 

After he succeeds his brother, Ambrosius, Uther holds a feast for his nobles, and seeing Igraine, falls in love with her. Sensing Uther Pendragon&#x27;s interest, Igraine asks her husband to take her back home to Cornwall. He placed her at the more defensible Tintagel Castle, while he prepared to defend his territory from Dimilioc. Incensed at their departing without leave, Uther lays siege to Gorlois&#x27; castles to little effect. He consults his friend Ulfin who tells him that the lady can hardly look favorably on someone who makes war on her husband, and suggests the king seek advice from Merlin in gaining access to Tintagel. Merlin devises an enchantment that disguises Uther in the form of Gorlois. In this form he approaches Igraine and they sleep together, conceiving Arthur. Unbeknownst to either of them, the real Gorlois has been killed that very night in battle against Uther&#x27;s troops. Eventually Igraine is persuaded to marry Uther. (In Thomas Hughes&#x27; 1587 play &quot;The Misfortunes of Arthur&quot;, Gorlois&#x27; ghost condemns Arthur for his father&#x27;s treachery.)

Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, following the later tradition of &quot;Merlin&quot; and French prose cycles, features Gorlois as the father of Morgan le Fay, Morgause, and Elaine, who are roughly corresponding with Brimesent, Belisent and Blasine in Gorlois&#x27; &quot;Hoel&quot; variant. After Gorlois&#x27; death, his three daughters are married off to vassals of Uther: Elaine to King Nentres of Garlot, Morgause to King Lot of Orkney, and (after she has received an education in a convent) Morgan to King Urien. Arthur is spared any knowledge of his half-sisters after he is whisked away by Merlin to be raised by Sir Ector.

The 11th/12th century Welsh text &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; lists &quot;Gormant son of Rica (Arthur&#x27;s brother on his mother&#x27;s side, his father the chief elder of Cornwall)&quot;. This passage is a parallel of later stories of Gorlois and Igraine. Scholars Rachel Bromwich and D. Simon Evans note the similarity between the &quot;Gor-&quot; element in Gormant and Gorlois&#x27; names, which could reflect a known practice in some late antiquity and early medieval European dynasties to share a name prefix. There is a possibility that Rica could be equated with Ricatus (or Recgisi), a name found on an 11th century Cornish cross. The Peniarth triads give the same title—Arthur&#x27;s chief elder at Celliwig, Cornwall—to Caradoc, which could also equate him with Rica.

The 13th century Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; calls Ygerne&#x27;s husband Hoel, Duke of Tintagell, with Ydiers as king of Cornwall. Hoel and Ygerne have five daughters together, who marry King Lot, King Ventres, King Urien, and King Briadas.

Richard Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602) places Gorlois as husband of Igerna and duke of Cornwall in 500 AD, who is succeeded by Earl Cador by 526 AD. The &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; (1600–1607) calls him Gurleis, Goulisor, or Gwrleis, duke or prince of Cornwall, and husband of Eigyr; he is the father of Cador, and son of Sortogus, a direct male-line descendant of Maxentius, Dyfnwal Moelmud, Camber and Brutus of Troy.

William Worcester travelled to Cornwall in 1478, and recorded in his &quot;Itineraries&quot; that &quot;Tador Duke of Cornwall, husband of the mother of Arthur was slain&quot; at Castle an Dinas. This is generally interpreted as a conflation of Gorlois with Cador, and as an alternative place of Gorlois&#x27; death, differing from the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;″s account that he died at Dimilioc.

==Possible historicity==
Henry Jenner considered Gorlois to be a real fifth or sixth-century figure, either a petty chief and vassal of the Royal House of Dumnonia, or of the line of the original chiefs of the Dumnonii if the kings of Dumnonia were the leaders of the Britons displaced by the Saxons. He suggested that Bosworlas (in St Just) and Treworlas were place names taken from Gorlois, and notes that Bosworlas () is very close to Bosigran ().

<doc id="766757" wikidata="Q127764" url="?curid=766757" title="David Daniels (countertenor)">
<text>David Daniels (born March 12, 1966) is an American countertenor. He was one of the most prominent classical stars to face criminal charges during the MeToo movement and pled guilty to sexual assault in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Daniels was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the son of two singing teachers. He began to sing as a boy soprano, moving to tenor as his voice matured. His father, baritone Perry Daniels, was one of the pre-eminent members of the performing faculty during each summer at Brevard Music Center, linked to the School of Music at Converse College in Spartanburg; his mother was an operatic soprano. Daniels studied music at the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music. Dissatisfied with his achievements as a tenor, Daniels switched to singing countertenor during graduate studies at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance (Master of Music in 1992) under the guidance of his teacher, George Shirley.

==Career==

Daniels made his professional singing debut in 1992. In 1997, he won the Richard Tucker Award. In 1999, he made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera, as Sesto in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;.

His repertoire has grown to include other major Handel roles, including Arsace in the comedy &quot;Partenope&quot; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and San Francisco Opera in 2014; the title role in &quot;Tamerlano&quot;; and Arsamene in &quot;Xerxes&quot;. At the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Daniels played the title roles in &quot;Rinaldo&quot; and &quot;Orlando&quot;, as well as David in &quot;Saul&quot;. He interpreted Ottone in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; and recorded the role of Nero in the same work; it was also his debut role at San Francisco Opera in 1998. In Vivaldi&#x27;s opera &quot;Bajazet&quot;, he sang the role of Tamerlano. In 2013, he sang the title role in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera.

Daniels has also branched out from the baroque roles usually associated with countertenors to include Oberon in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, and as Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In July 2013 he created the role of Oscar Wilde in &quot;Oscar&quot; at the Santa Fe Opera, written for him by Theodore Morrison; he then sang &quot;Oscar&quot; again in Opera Philadelphia&#x27;s production in 2015. The same year he made his debut at the Vienna State Opera as Trinculo in Thomas Adès&#x27; opera &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

From fall 2015 to March 2020, Daniels joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance, as Professor of Music in Voice.

== Sexual assault guilty plea ==
In the fall of 2018, Daniels was placed on leave by the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance after allegations of sexual assault. Following the allegations, a second student – a countertenor who studied with Daniels at the University of Michigan — accused Daniels of sexual assault, bringing civil lawsuits against both Daniels and the University of Michigan, in October 2018. In response to the second lawsuit, Daniels filed a counter-claim, but his and his accusers&#x27; lawsuits were mutually dismissed. However, Daniels&#x27;s accusers&#x27; Title IX lawsuit remained against the University of Michigan for failing to protect himself and other students from Daniels, reaching a settlement in 2023.

The San Francisco Opera removed Daniels from its 2019 production of &quot;Orlando&quot; &quot;after considerable deliberation given the serious allegations of sexual assault&quot;. In January 2019, Texas filed charges of second-degree sexual assault against Daniels and his husband, who were then arrested in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On March 26, 2020, at the recommendation of U-M President Mark Schlissel and in a unanimous vote by the Board of Regents, Daniels was dismissed from U-M effective immediately and without severance pay. Daniels filed a federal lawsuit against the University of Michigan three years after being fired, but the case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Sean Cox. The judge also dismissed Daniels&#x27; lawsuit against a student who had accused Daniels of sexual misconduct.

On August 4, 2023, both Daniels and his husband, conductor Scott Walters, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting another singer in Houston in 2010. As part of the plea agreement, both will be spared prison time. Daniels will face eight years of probation, a lifetime requirement to register as a sex offender and an order that he refrain from contact with the singer he assaulted.

== Personal life ==
Daniels married conductor Scott Walters at Dumbarton House in Washington, DC, on June 21, 2014; the ceremony was conducted by United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

<doc id="766763" wikidata="Q1019534" url="?curid=766763" title="Trongsa">
<text>Trongsa, previously Tongsa (, ), is a Thromde or town, and the capital of Trongsa District in central Bhutan. The name means &quot;new village&quot; in Dzongkha. The first temple was built in 1543 by the Drukpa lama Ngagi Wangchuck, who was the great-grandfather of Ngawang Namgyal, Zhabdrung Rinpoche, the unifier of Bhutan.

==Trongsa Dzong==

Chökhor Raptentse Dzong at Trongsa which was built in 1644, used to be the seat of power of the Wangchuck dynasty before it became rulers of Bhutan in 1907. Traditionally the King of Bhutan first becomes the Trongsa Penlop (governor) before being named Crown Prince and eventually King. Built on a mountain spur high above the gorges of the Mangde Chhu, the dzong controlled east-west trade for centuries. The only road connecting eastern and western Bhutan (the precursor to the modern Lateral Road), passed through the courtyard of the dzong. At the command of the &quot;penlop&quot; the massive doors could be shut, dividing the country in two. 

Higher yet on the mountainside is a watchtower, called &quot;Ta Dzong&quot;(watch tower), built to guard the dzong from enemies but now housing a museum and a chapel dedicated to Jigme Namgyal who was Trongsa Penlop from 1853 to 1870.
Early establishment of Trongsa Dzong.

As per the prophecy ལུང་བསྟན། of lha dang lama, In 1543 the tutor [yong-zinཡོངས་འཛིན] of kuenkhen Pema karpo ཀུན་མཁྱེན་པདྨ་དཀར་པོ། visited yoelingའོད་གླིང་། village to the north བྱང་ཕྱོགས། of current day Trongsa dzong, where yoeling temple ལྷ་ཁང་།ོ is located. In his clear spiritual vision, he saw a sparkling light emerging at night from a cliff in the middle of a forest. Later that day, when he went to the site, he saw the bagha བྷ་ག of dorji phamo and the soul lake བླ་མཚོ། of pelden Lhamo དཔལ་ལྡན་ལྷ་མོ།[Mahakali] as well as the footprints of her riding horse འཆིབ་རྟ along the waist of the cliff. Yongzin Rinpoche then built a hermitage at the particular site and meditated in the area, where he saw Pelden Lhamo in person. In that event, he realized it to be a prophecy for the place to have a Majestic Dzong, from which the reign of the Pelden Drukpa would flourish as the rays of the Sun.

The valley of Trongsa also known as Mang-Dey.

Trongsa is also known as Mang-deg which later became Mang-dey, with a change in the spelling and pronunciation of the second word. The history behind who, why and when the name was given runs back to the time when Buddhist scholar Kuenkhen Longchen Rabjam visited Trongsa around 1357 and conferred kachoe བཀའ་ཆོས། spiritual teaching at the place called Sherabling. During that time the people of Trongsa [devotees] offered plenty of druna འབྲུ་སྣ། [grain] as offering. In an enchanting way, Kuenkhen Rinpoche said, &quot;since you all offered me plenty of grain, the place will be called &#x27;Mang-Deg&#x27;&quot; མང་སྡེག- mang meaning plenty and deg meaning offered. Thus the name of the place was derived from Kuenkhen Rinpoche&#x27;s statement, and was known as Mang-deg, which later changed to mag-dey as mentioned before, with the change of time.

<text>Juan Santamaría Rodríguez (August 29, 1831 – April 11, 1856) was a drummer in the Costa Rican army, officially recognized as the national hero of his country for his actions in the 1856 Second Battle of Rivas, in the Filibuster War. He died in the battle carrying a torch he used to light the enemy stronghold on fire, securing a victory for Costa Rica against American mercenary William Walker and his forces. Thirty five years after his death, he began to be idolized and was used as a propaganda tool to inspire Costa Rican nationalism. A national holiday in Costa Rica, Juan Santamaría Day, is held annually on April 11 to commemorate his death. 

On September 15, 1891, a huge bronze statue of the hero was erected in Juan Santamaría de Alajuela Park in his home town, Alajuela. Later, the main airport of Costa Rica, and the historical museum of Alajuela were named after him, and many literary, musical, and art works have been created in his honor. Along with commemorating his heroic acts, many historical studies have been done to investigate the true identity and actions of Juan Santamaría.

== Life ==
Santamaría was born in the city of Alajuela on August 29, 1831. His mother was María Manuela Santamaría, and his father was unknown. He went to elementary school in Alajuela before working from a young age. Santamaría had many jobs in Alajuela such as a sweets vendor, laborer, coffee picker, and, finally, a drummer in the military band of Alajuela, which lead him to become a drummer for the Costa Rican Army. He was a drummer boy in the Costa Rican army until his death in the Second Battle of Rivas while completing the heroic deed for which he is remembered.

== Participation in the Filibuster War ==

The war began when William Walker, a United States filibuster, or person engaged in unauthorized warfare against a foreign country, overthrew the government of Nicaragua in 1856 and attempted to conquer the other nations in Central America, including Costa Rica, in order to form a private slaveholding empire. Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora Porras called upon the general population to take up arms and march north to Nicaragua to fight against the foreign invader. This started the Filibuster War. Santamaría, a poor laborer and the illegitimate son of a single mother joined the army as a drummer boy. The troops nicknamed him &quot;el erizo&quot; (&quot;the hedgehog&quot;) on account of his spiked hair.

After routing a small contingent of Walker&#x27;s soldiers at an hacienda called Santa Rosa, Guanacaste, the Costa Rican troops continued marching north and reached the city of Rivas, Nicaragua, on April 8, 1856. The battle that ensued is known as the Second Battle of Rivas. Combat was fierce and the Costa Ricans were not able to drive out Walker&#x27;s men, entrenched in a building near the town center, from which they commanded an advantageous firing position.

According to the traditional account, on April 11, Salvadoran General José María Cañas suggested that one of the soldiers advance towards the hostel with a torch and set it on fire. Some soldiers tried and failed, but Santamaría finally volunteered on the condition that in the event of his death, someone would look after his mother. He then advanced and was mortally wounded by enemy fire. Before expiring, however, he succeeded in setting fire to the building, thus contributing decisively to the Costa Rican victory at Rivas.

This account is supported by a petition for a state pension filed in November 1857 by Santamaría&#x27;s mother, as well as by government documents showing that the pension was granted. Various historians, however, have questioned whether the account is accurate and whether Santamaria died under different circumstances. At any rate, towards the end of the nineteenth century, Costa Rican intellectuals and politicians seized on the war against Walker and on the figure of Santamaría for nationalist purposes.

== National symbolism ==

=== Santamaría&#x27;s initial fame ===

Following his death, the Filibuster War raged on, eventually ending in the defeat of William Walker and his forces. Juan Santamaría&#x27;s actions, however, were not mentioned in Costa Rican national discourse until 1885, 29 years after his death. His name was first mentioned in an article in &quot;El Diario de Costa Rica,&quot; a national newspaper, titled &quot;Un Héroe Anómino&quot;. This article was written in response to the threats to Costa Rican independence from Guatemala&#x27;s dictator at the time, Justo Rufino Barrios; Barrios declared he would use force to unite the countries of Central America in the Union of Central America if they did not consent on their own to unity. &quot;Un Héroe Anónimo&quot; was written about Santamaría&#x27;s sacrifice and two other generals from the Filibuster War to inspire and mobilize the population of Costa Rica against the threat to their sovereignty. This call to arms was repeated as the article was published in other official newspapers, and the President of Costa Rica at the time declared a new national steamship would bear the name The Juan Santamaría in the hero&#x27;s honor. Juan Santamaría was used as a figurehead around which Costa Rican leaders developed a national identity to rally support in defending Costa Rican sovereignty. While Costa Rican troops never even fought against Guatemalan forces due to the defeat of Barrios by troops from El Salvador, the story of Juan Santamaría remained a central feature of Costa Rican national identity, and he was soon declared a national hero. Through written press, festivals in his honor, and the promotion of his story by the education system, Juan Santamaría became a symbol of Costa Rica.

=== Becoming a symbol for Costa Rican independence ===
The nationally recognized independence day in Costa Rica is September 15, the anniversary of the day Central America declared independence from Spain in 1821. However Costa Rican independence has become synonymous with Juan Santamaría, the Second Battle of Rivas and the Filibuster War, because this was the only time the country fought to remain a sovereign nation. In 1891, on September 15, a statue of Juan Santamaría was erected in Alajuela to commemorate him, and on many later Independence Day celebrations the government further honored and celebrated Juan Santamaría for his heroism in the struggle against William Walker. Additionally, the anniversary of his death, April 11th, is a national holiday: Juan Santamaría Day.

=== A popular hero ===
Coming from humble beginnings and remaining a low level soldier in the national campaign, Juan Santamaría became a hero who represents the everyday people of Costa Rica. Much of the population identifies Santamaría as &quot;one of them&quot;, and this distinction is what makes his story resonate with so many people, causing them to support him even more as a national hero. 

==Memorials==
On the 15th of September, 1891, the government unveiled the large bronze statue of Juan Santamaría in the park in Alajuela named after the hero. The statue was commissioned by the Costa Rican government and made by the French sculptor Aristide Croisy. Around the base of the statue are images depicting Santamaría volunteering himself to his leader to attempt to burn down the building, and him dying while setting the building alight. Beneath these images sit lion heads, symbolic of strength and courage. At the unveiling of the statue there was a parade in his honor with the President, prominent leadership from the Catholic Church, governors, foreign dignitaries, and the family of other prominent Costa Rican heroes. There were musical performances and speeches emphasizing his heroism and sacrifice, some even comparing him to Christ. 

Other statues of Juan Santamaría can be found outside the Costa Rican Embassy in Spain, and in front of the Costa Rican National Congress in San José. 

The coat of arms of Alajuela was changed in 1908 to feature a hand holding a torch, symbolic of Juan Santamaría&#x27;s heroic act in carrying the torch to burn down the enemy stronghold in the Second Battle of Rivas.

The international airport, located in the city of Alajuela (Santamaría&#x27;s place of birth), and which serves San José, the capital city of Costa Rica, was also named after him.

==Anthem==
In 1891, Pedro Calderón Navarro and Emilio Pacheco Cooper composed an anthem, &quot;Himno Patriótico A Juan Santamaría, 11 De Abril&quot;, to Juan Santamaría. It was sung for the first time during the Juan Santamaria Statue inauguration on the 15 of September of 1891. The lyrics are as follows: 


== Historical debate ==
No single or conclusive identity for Juan Santamaría has been agreed upon by scholars and historians, thus the debate over his existence continues to this day. They cite his baptismal certificate, documentation of his name on a list of soldiers from Alajuela, and his mother&#x27;s pension filing. 

The first writings about Juan Santamaría were by José de Obaldía and Álvaro Contreras Membreño; in their essays they referred to Santamaría as &quot;glorious&quot; and a &quot;sublime martyr&quot; who gave his life for Costa Rica. Their articles were not written just to tell Santamaría&#x27;s story, but to unify the population against a threat to their sovereignty. This motivation is important to remember because it influenced how Santamaría was portrayed. Despite being a mulatto, or of mixed race, as his story was popularized, he was significantly white-washed. Even in the famous bronze statue of Santamaría, he looks white and is wearing a French soldier&#x27;s uniform, further reinforcing the description that he was white. When Santamaría was first glorified, Costa Rican leaders wanted to unify the country as a homogenous and white nation, which caused them to depict Juan Santamaría as white. This misrepresentation caused many historians to question the authenticity of Santamaría as a real person. The municipality of Alajuela, in order to prove Santamaría was real, compiled witnesses and fellow soldiers to attest that he was real, and that he died burning down the enemy stronghold in Rivas. The municipality of Alajuela also provided materials such as his birth certificate, and his mother&#x27;s request for pension from the government. These documents and statements were all assembled in the book called &quot;El Libro del Héroe&quot;, or The Book of Hero. Furthermore, Santamaría&#x27;s baptismal certificate from a church in Alajuela was found, and along with his own name, it also has his mother&#x27;s name, María Manuela Santamaría. The certificate listed his father&#x27;s name as unknown, supporting the story that Santamaría was raised by a single mother. Two more documents that historians use to prove his existence can be found in the Costa Rican national archives. These documents are two separate lists of soldiers from Alajuela; the name Juan Santamaría can be seen on both.

A document listing the names and causes of death for soldiers in the Costa Rican army, however, is one of the reasons some doubt the story of Juan Santamaría&#x27;s actions in the Second Battle of Rivas. This document written in 1858 by the chaplain of the Costa Rican army, Priest Rafael Francisco Calvo, listed a man named Juan Santamaría from Alajuela who died from cholera, a common deadly illness at the time. A doctor who lived with Calvo later in his life named Rafael Calderón Muñoz claims when he asked the priest about the man who died of cholera, Calvo claimed it was a different Juan Santamaría than the hero. Other documents brought forward that support Calvo&#x27;s claim that it was a different Juan Santamaría include a military census listing five different people named Juan Santamaría from Alajuela, and a different report of people who died between April and May of 1856 that listed the death of a Juan Santamaría who died in Rivas. Despite lacking proof of details, there is a strong and consistent oral tradition that Juan Santamaría existed, he was present at the Second Battle of Rivas, he was one of the people who participated in burning down the building, and he died in the act.

<doc id="766765" wikidata="Q1281188" url="?curid=766765" title="Cheesemaking">
<text>Cheesemaking (or caseiculture) is the craft of making cheese. The production of cheese, like many other food preservation processes, allows the nutritional and economic value of a food material, in this case milk, to be preserved in concentrated form. Cheesemaking allows the production of the cheese with diverse flavors and consistencies.

==History==
Cheesemaking is documented in Egyptian tomb drawings and in ancient Greek literature.

Cheesemaking may have originated from nomadic herdsmen who stored milk in vessels made from sheep&#x27;s and goats&#x27; stomachs. Because their stomach linings contain a mix of lactic acid, bacteria as milk contaminants and rennet, the milk would ferment and coagulate. A product reminiscent of yogurt would have been produced, which through gentle agitation and the separation of curds from whey would have resulted in the production of cheese; the cheese being essentially a concentration of the major milk protein, casein, and milk fat. The whey proteins, other major milk proteins, and lactose are all removed in the cheese whey. Another theory is offered by David Asher, who wrote that the origins actually lie within the &quot;sloppy milk bucket in later European culture, it having gone unwashed and containing all of the necessary bacteria to facilitate the ecology of cheese&quot;.

=== Ancient cheesemaking ===
One of the ancient cheesemakers&#x27; earliest tools for cheesemaking, cheese molds or strainers, can be found throughout Europe, dating back to the Bronze Age. Baskets were used to separate the cheese curds, but as technology advanced, these cheese molds would be made of wood or pottery. The cheesemakers placed the cheese curds inside of the mold, secured the mold with a lid, then added pressure to separate the whey, which would drain out from the holes in the mold. The more whey that was drained, the less moisture retained in the cheese. Less moisture meant that the cheese would be firmer. In Ireland, some cheeses ranged from a dry and hard cheese (mullahawn) to a semi-liquid cheese (millsén).

The designs and patterns were often used to decorate the cheeses and differentiate between them. Since many monastic establishments and abbeys owned their share of milk animals at the time, it was commonplace for the cheeses they produced to bear a cross in the middle.

Although the common perception of cheese today is made from cow&#x27;s milk, goat&#x27;s milk was actually the preferred base of ancient cheesemakers, because goats are smaller animals than cows. This meant that goats required less food and were easier to transport and herd. Moreover, goats can breed any time of the year as opposed to sheep, who also produce milk, but mating season only came around during fall and winter.

Before the age of pasteurization, cheesemakers knew that certain cheeses could cause constipation or kidney stones, so they advised their customers to supplement these side effects by eating in moderation along with other foods and consuming walnuts, almonds, or horseradish.

==Process==
The goal of cheese making is to control the spoiling of milk into cheese. The milk is traditionally from a cow, goat, sheep, or buffalo, although, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. Cow&#x27;s milk is most commonly used worldwide. The cheesemaker&#x27;s goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics (appearance, aroma, taste, texture). The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.

Some cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.

===Culturing===
Cheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese (&#x27;eye holes&#x27;).

Starter cultures are chosen to give a cheese its specific characteristics. In the case of mould-ripened cheese such as Stilton, Roquefort or Camembert, mould spores (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.

===Coagulation===
During the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts κ-casein to para-κ-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.
===Draining===
Once the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition. To prevent such decomposition it is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.
===Scalding===
In making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately to &#x27;scald&#x27; the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and &#x27;blocked&#x27; (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as &#x27;cheddaring&#x27;. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.

===Mould-ripening===

In contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a gentler treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white mould spores have not been added to the cheese milk it is applied to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mould spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., &quot;Penicillium candida&quot;.

By taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, allowing the surface mould to grow and the mould-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur. Mould-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the fungi used are biochemically very active when compared with starter bacteria. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced with stainless steel wires, to admit air to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as Saint-Nectaire, may also be influenced by yeasts which contribute flavour and coat texture. Others are allowed to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances, e.g., by the growth of &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot; which gives an orange coat to cheeses.

<text>Tsirang District (; ; previously Chirang) is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) of Bhutan. The administrative center of the district is Damphu.

Tsirang is noted for its gentle slopes and mild climates. The dzongkhag is also noted for its rich biodiversity; however, it is one of the few dzongkhags without a protected area. One of Bhutan&#x27;s longest rivers, the Punatsang Chhu or Sankosh river flows through the district. It is the main district where the Lhotshampa resides. It has many beautiful places such as Rigsum Pemai Dumra, Pemachoeling Heritage Forest, Tsirang Namgyel Chholing Dratshang, and Nye.

==Languages==
The dominant language in Tsirang is Nepali, but it can be partially different from those spoken in Nepal, spoken by the heterogeneous Lhotshampa like Bhujel, Magar, Tamang, Gurung, Limbu, Rai, etc. In the north of Tsirang, Dzongkha, the national language, is also spoken.

==Administrative divisions==
Tsirang District is divided into twelve village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Gairigaon/Barshong Gewog
*Dunglegang Gewog
*Gosarling Gewog
*Kikhorthang Gewog
*Lamidara/Mendrelgang Gewog
*Bataney/Patshaling Gewog
*Phutenchhu Gewog
*Rangthangling Gewog
*Semjong Gewog
*Sergithang Gewog
*Tsholingkhar Gewog
*Tsirangtoe Gewog
==Geography==
Tsirang covers a total area of 639 sq km. The northernmost reaches of Tsirang District (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Phutenchhu and Sergithang) lie within Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, one of the protected areas of Bhutan.

==Education==
(As at 2018) Tsirang has two Central Schools (which operate at a level higher than &#x27;Lower Secondary&#x27;): Tsirangtoed CS and Damphu Central School

<text>A coppersmith, also known as a brazier, is a person who makes artifacts from copper and brass. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. The term &quot;redsmith&quot; is used for a tinsmith that uses tinsmithing tools and techniques to make copper items.

==History==
Anthropologists believe copper to be the first metal used by humans due to its softness and ease of manipulation. In antiquity, copper&#x27;s durability and resistance to rust or corrosion proved valuable. Copper&#x27;s relationship with man is thought to date back over six thousand years. Coppersmith is one of the few trades that have a mention in the Bible.

Copper was particularly worked in England, with ores smelted in Wales as early as the 1500s. Copper was found in great quantities in North America, especially Montana, as well as archaic copper mines near Lake Superior, which was recorded by a Jesuit missionary in 1659.

Coppersmithing as a trade benefited strongly from the invention of sheet metal rollers. Copper sheet was then available in a much more versatile and easy form for creating copper wares. By the 1700s, coppersmiths lived in the American colonies, but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the British Crown&#x27;s regulation of copper and other goods to the Americas. Sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the American Revolution.

==Coppersmith trade==

Most coppersmiths can create, from a pattern, copper wares from a sheet of copper. They can also repair, clean and re-tin copper cookware interiors. Some copper smiths make barrels. Some coppersmiths will specialize in specific forms or items, such as a particular type of biscuit oven or mug or kettle. In the 1700 and 1800s, coppersmiths typically had a few apprentices in various stages of learning the trade working together.

Apprentices would start learning the trade usually around 8 or 9 years old. Typical duties of a youth in the copper shop would include tasks such as breaking coke or sal ammoniac blocks, scouring copper pieces to prepare them for tinning, and polishing hammers and tools.

In regions where copper is mined like Iberia and India there are a number of centers where the coppersmith trade has flourished.

==Examples of objects made by modern coppersmiths ==
These include:
* jewellery, sculptures, weather vanes, overmantels, fenders, decorative panels, and challenge shields; 
*plates and cookware, cigarette cases, tobacco jars, tea and coffee pots, jugs, vases, trays, frames, rose bowls, timpani, kettles (cooking, brewing, dying, fish and hatter), stew, fry and sauce pans, warming pans or kettledrum bowls; 
*awnings, light fixtures, fountains, range hoods, cupolas, and stills.
*butter churn, ship sheathing, copper mugs, ladles, funnels, basins, coal scuttle, glue pots.
Notable copper styles in the UK include Newlyn in Cornwall and Keswick in Cumbria. Coppersmith work started waning in the late 1970s and early 1980s and those in the sheetmetal trade began doing the coppersmith&#x27;s work, the practices used being similar to those in the plumbing trade. Coppersmiths in recent years have turned to pipe work, not only in copper but also stainless steel and aluminium, particularly in the aircraft industry.

==Properties of copper==
Copper is generally considered to be a soft metal, meaning it can be worked without heating. Over a period of working the metal in this way it can &quot;work-harden&quot;. This means that the atoms within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement. This causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points. In order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be annealed. This process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water. The cooling stage is known as quenching. By heating the copper, the atoms in the metal are relaxed, and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion. This allows for easier shaping of the metal. In order to keep this uniformity within the metal, it is cooled rapidly. This prevents the atoms from moving around and causing tension in the structure of the metal. Unlike ferrous metals—which must be cooled slowly to anneal—copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water.

<doc id="766775" wikidata="Q488541" url="?curid=766775" title="Fisher separation theorem">
<text>In Economics, the Fisher separation theorem asserts that the primary objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. The theorem, therefore, separates management&#x27;s &quot;productive opportunities&quot; from the entrepreneur&#x27;s &quot;market opportunities&quot;. It was proposed by—and is named after—the economist Irving Fisher.

The theorem has its &quot;clearest and most famous exposition&quot; in the &quot;Theory of Interest&quot; (1930); particularly in the &quot;second approximation to the theory of interest&quot; (II:VI).

The Fisher separation theorem states that:
* the firm&#x27;s investment decision is independent of the consumption preferences of the owner;
* the investment decision is independent of the financing decision.
* the value of a capital project (investment) is independent of the mix of methods – equity, debt, and/or cash – used to finance the project.
Fisher showed the above as follows:
#The firm can make the investment decision — i.e. the choice between productive opportunities — that maximizes its present value, independent of its owner&#x27;s investment preferences.
#The firm can &quot;then&quot; ensure that the owner achieves his optimal position in terms of &quot;market opportunities&quot; by funding its investment either with borrowed funds, or internally as appropriate.

<doc id="766778" wikidata="Q197564" url="?curid=766778" title="Zhemgang District">
<text>Zhemgang District (Dzongkha: གཞམས་སྒང་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie transliteration: &quot;Gzhams-sgang rdzong-khag&quot;; previously &quot;Shemgang&quot;), is one of the 20 dzongkhags (districts) comprising Bhutan. It is bordered by Sarpang, Trongsa, Bumthang, Mongar and Pemagatshel Districts, and borders Assam in India to the south. The administrative center of the district is Zhemgang. Major attractions of the Zhemgang district are Buli Tsho and Duenmang Tshachu.

==Languages==
The dominant language in Zhemgang is Khengkha. Historically, Khengkha and its speakers have had close contact with speakers of Kurtöpkha, Nupbikha, and Bumthangkha to the north, to the extent that they may be considered part of a wider collection of &quot;Bumthang languages.&quot; The term Ngalop may subsume several related linguistic and cultural groups, such as the Kheng people and speakers of Bumthang language.
S.R. Chakravarty asserts that Kheng are one of the earliest inhabitants that language spread upwards from Kheng into Bumthang and Kurtöp. By all accounts the Kheng are more closely related to the people of central Bhutan than they are to their neighbors in eastern Bhutan, who are primarily Sharchops. The Kheng still retain special trade relations with the Bumthang, including providing winter pasture rights for Bumthang yaks. SIL International estimates there are 50,000 Kheng speakers.

==Security issues==
Starting in the 1990s, the United Liberation Front of Assam maintained guerrilla bases in the forests of southern Zhemgang from which they would launch attacks on targets in India and then return across the border. In late 2003 the King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck led a military operation which largely swept the guerrillas out of the region. Because of the risk of attack, foreign tourists were not allowed to visit Zhemgang in the past.

==Administrative divisions==
Zhemgang Districts comprises eight village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Bardho Gewog
*Bjoka Gewog

Most of Zhemgang District is part of the protected areas of Bhutan. Zhemgang&#x27;s environmentally protected areas include Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (the &quot;gewog&quot; of Trong) and Royal Manas National Park (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Ngangla, Pangkhar and Trong), which occupy much of the west. These parks connect to Phrumsengla National Park in the north (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Nangkor and Shingkhar) via a biological corridor that bisects Zhemgang.

<text>Beighton ()—which includes the districts of Beighton, Hackenthorpe, Owlthorpe, and Sothall—is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the eastern part of the city, on the border with Rotherham and covers an area of 5.7 km2. The population of this ward in 2011 was 17,939 people in 7,538 households.

Before 1967, the districts of this ward formed part of Derbyshire. In that year an extension of the then County Borough of Sheffield took in the area, which was consequently transferred to the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974 the area became part of the City of Sheffield, in the metropolitan and ceremonial county of South Yorkshire.

== Districts of Beighton ward ==
=== Beighton ===
Beighton () is now a suburb of Sheffield after much expansion from a village in the last 100 years. The village was mentioned three times in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bectun&quot;—the name meaning a farmstead beside a stream (or ). Some remnants of the old village have survived including the church of Saint Mary the Virgin, which was built in the 12th century. The population in 1931 was 5,553.

Being primarily a coal mining area, many of the houses erected in the first part of the 20th century were by the National Coal Board. Later expansion in the last 30 years has been in private housing.

The Rother Valley Country Park is just outside the eastern edge of the village and is a local centre for water sports. A number of artificial lakes have been created for this purpose.

Beighton railway station was on the Great Central Main Line.

The parish church St. Mary the Virgin was restored in 1868 and a clock was erected in the tower in 1921 as a memorial to parishioners who gave their lives in the Great War.

Beighton Miners Welfare F.C. and Beighton Recreation F.C. both represented the area in the FA Cup

===Sothall===

Sothall also includes the Meadowgate estate. It should not be confused with Southall.

Brook House Junior School is the main junior school in Sothall, with 304 pupils. It serves from Year 3 to Year 6 (7-11 year olds). Beighton Nursery Infant School is the main nursery and the main infant school in the area. The nursery section serves 0-4 year olds and the infant school serves Reception to Year 2 (4-7 year olds).

===Owlthorpe===
Owlthorpe is a mainly residential area with the areas of Hackenthorpe, Birley and Waterthorpe. Sheffield Supertram circulates around the estate and can be easily accessed depending on your location at three tram stops: Birley Moor Road, Hackenthorpe or Donetsk Way. It was mostly rural until the late 1980s when major development was planned and followed through for the area.

=== Hackenthorpe ===
Hackenthorpe is a village 5 miles south east of Sheffield&#x27;s city centre, now classed as a historic township of the city. Due to much expansion, the village became a part of Sheffield city during the 1950s. During much of the late 19th and 20th centuries the village was noted for its steelmaking, with the Thomas Staniforth &amp; Co sickle works being based at Main Street. Another prominent feature of the village is the 17th century Hackenthorpe Hall, built by John Newbould for the Hounsfield family, with James Hounsfield being a prominent land owner. The building is today used as a nursery. Hackenthope was once a part of Derbyshire in the parish of Beighton but is now part of South Yorkshire.

<doc id="766802" wikidata="Q7140198" url="?curid=766802" title="Parterre Box">
<text>Parterre Box (often stylized as parterre box) is an online magazine devoted to opera, which cultivates an attitude that may be deemed to be campy, critical and opinionated with explicitly gay overtones. 

The publication was founded by the New Yorker James Jorden in 1993 during a period of under-employment as an opera director. It appeared bi-monthly from 1993 to 2001 in print form. It is now solely published on the Web, where it is considered an influential opera blog.

In May 2005, Jorden introduced the first regular opera podcast entitled &quot;Unnatural Acts of Opera&quot;. For this show, Jorden took on the drag persona of &quot;La Cieca&quot;, a gossip commentator. La Cieca introduced a single act of what she called &quot;demented&quot; opera, concentrating on live vocal performances from around 1950 to the time the acts started. 

A highlight of the 2006 season of &quot;Unnatural Acts of Opera&quot; was the first ever podcast of Richard Wagner&#x27;s four-opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, an event Jorden termed &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;. Jorden has also contributed a number of opera video clips to YouTube, concentrating on his favorite divas, including Renata Scotto, Leonie Rysanek and Dame Gwyneth Jones.

The podcasts appear to have ended in 2009 and are known to be available in various services, including iTunes and in streaming form on the parterre.com website.

From 2009-13, Jorden contributed opera reviews to the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

<text>Bururi Province is one of the eighteen provinces of Burundi. It was formerly Burundi&#x27;s largest province until the communes of Burambi, Buyengero and Rumonge were transferred to the province of Rumonge when it was created in 2015.

==Location==

Bururi Province is in the southeast of Burundi.
It looks over Lake Tanganyika to the west.
It is south of Bujumbura Rural Province and Mwaro Province, west of Gitega Province and Rutana Province, and north of Makamba Province.
The west coastal strip is in the Imbo natural region. Further inland it covers part of the Mumirwa natural region, Mugamba natural region and Bututsi natural region.

==Overview==
Bururi Province was created on 26 September 1960 as part of national political and administrative reforms initiated by the Belgian colonial administration in Ruanda-Urundi. Burundi became independent in 1962 and the province was retained in the new national constitution.

The provincial capital is Bururi. Bururi Province is home to the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve, a remnant Afromontane tropical forest. The Ruvyironza River, which rises in Bururi Province, is the southernmost source of the Nile.

Bururi is famous for the number of military and political leaders to have been born there, including three consecutive presidents (Michel Micombero, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and Pierre Buyoya) following the country&#x27;s independence.

==Communes==
It is divided administratively into the following communes:

* Commune of Bururi
* Commune of Matana
* Commune of Mugamba

<doc id="766812" wikidata="Q167551" url="?curid=766812" title="Gitega">
<text>Gitega (), formerly Kitega, is the political capital of Burundi. Located in the centre of the country, in the Burundian central plateau roughly east of Bujumbura, the largest city and former political capital, Gitega is the country&#x27;s fourth largest city and former royal capital of the Kingdom of Burundi until its abolition in 1966. In late December 2018, Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would follow on a 2007 promise to return Gitega its former political capital status, with Bujumbura remaining as economic capital and centre of commerce. A vote in the Parliament of Burundi made the change official on 16 January 2019, with all branches of government expected to move in over three years.

==Geography==
Gitega is the capital of Gitega Province, one of the eighteen provinces of Burundi. It is located in the center of the country, at roughly the same distance between the commercial capital, Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika to the west, the Tanzanian border to the east—both at around —and the Rwandan border, about to the north. It lies on a broad plateau surrounded by hills, a few kilometres southwest of the confluence of the Ruvyironza and Rurubu Rivers. Ruvubu National Park, the country&#x27;s biggest, lies to the east.

==Climate==
==History==

Gitega was at one time the seat of the Kingdom of Burundi and remained as capital of the kings of Burundi (&quot;mwami&quot;) until 1966.

The Germans laid out the plan for the modern town of Gitega in 1912 when Burundi was part of German East Africa.

In March 2007, President of Burundi Pierre Nkurunziza announced that Burundi was planning to bring back its capital city to Gitega, saying that it is in a better location for a capital than Bujumbura.

On 24 December 2018, it was announced by Nkurunziza that Gitega was to become the capital city of Burundi, pending only Parliament approval. The expected parliamentary assent (given the President&#x27;s CNDD-FFD party comfortable majority in both chambers) arrived through a vote on 16 January 2019, with some ministries already starting the move two days later.

On 7 December 2021, a fire broke out in an overcrowded prison in Gitega, killing at least 38 and injuring more than 69.

== Education ==
The Polytechnic University of Gitega was founded in 2014.

==Culture==
It is the home of Burundi&#x27;s National Museum of Gitega. Several &quot;karyenda&quot; royal drum sanctuaries are located in the area, as well as the &quot;ibwami&quot; (royal court). On 29 April 1972, Ntare V of Burundi, the country&#x27;s last &quot;Mwami&quot; (King), was killed in Gitega.

== Places of worship ==
Places of worship in Gitega are predominantly Christian churches and cathedrals, including: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gitega (Catholic Church), Province of the Anglican Church of Burundi (Anglican Communion), Union of Baptist Churches in Burundi (Baptist World Alliance), and Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.

==Transportation==
Gitega was served by Gitega Airport, which is now defunct. Gitega is served by four National Roads (&quot;Routes Nationales&quot;, RN): RN2 connects it with Bujumbura through the northwest, via Muramvya and Bujumbura Rural provinces. RN15 leads to the north of country, towards Ngozi and continuing on to Rwanda, while passing through the ancient royal court of Gishora; RN12, which separates from RN15 on the outskirts of Gitega, heads northeast to serve the provinces of Karuzi and Muyinga. The last is RN3, which heads towards the southwest towards Rumonge and Lake Tanganyika.

<text>Sandra Dale Dennis (April 27, 1937 – March 2, 1992) was an American actress. She made her film debut in the drama &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961). For her performance in the comedy-drama film &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Dennis appeared in the films &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; (1967), &quot;The Fox&quot; (1967), &quot;Sweet November&quot; (1968), &quot;That Cold Day in the Park&quot; (1969), &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970), &quot;God Told Me To&quot; (1976), &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981), &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; (1982), and &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988). Her final film appearance came in the crime drama film &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; (1991).

Dennis had a successful career on stage, appearing in the original stage production of &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;. For her performance in the play &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, she received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. For her performance in the play &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, she received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

Dennis was a renowned animal activist. She rescued stray cats from the bowels of Grand Central Terminal. At the time of her death in Westport, Connecticut, she lived with more than 20 cats, who were adopted out by longtime friends to new homes.

==Early life==
Dennis was born in Hastings, Nebraska, the daughter of Yvonne (née Hudson), a secretary, and Jack Dennis, a postal clerk. Her parents divorced in 1966 after 38 years of marriage. She had one brother, Frank, who was eight years older. Dennis grew up in Kenesaw, Nebraska, and Lincoln, Nebraska, graduating from Lincoln High School in 1955; one of her classmates was writer and comedian Dick Cavett. She attended Nebraska Wesleyan University and the University of Nebraska, appearing in the Lincoln Community Theater Group before moving to New York City at age 19. She studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
===Early career===
Dennis made her television debut in 1956 in the soap opera &quot;The Guiding Light.&quot;

She had an early break when cast as an understudy in the Broadway production of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1957) directed by Elia Kazan. Kazan cast Dennis in her first feature film, a small part in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961), which starred Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty.

Dennis was cast in &quot;Face of a Hero&quot; (1960) on Broadway alongside Jack Lemmon. The play had only a short run, but Dennis received good notices. &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot; (1961–62) by Graham Greene was more successful, running for 101 performances; Michael Redgrave and Googie Withers were also in the cast.

===Broadway stardom===
Dennis achieved Broadway fame with her leading role in Herb Gardner&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot; (1962–63), for which she won a Tony award for her performance alongside Jason Robards. The show ran for 428 performances.

Around this time, Dennis guest-starred on episodes of the TV series &quot;Naked City&quot; (&quot;Idylls of a Running Back&quot;, 1962, &quot;Carrier&quot;, 1963), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (&quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot;, 1963), &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot; (&quot;Somewhat Lower Than the Angels&quot; 1964), and &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Mention My Name in Sheboygan&quot;, 1964). She was the lead of the Broadway comedy &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; (1964–66), which ran for 983 performances and won her a second Tony.

===Film stardom===
Dennis&#x27; second film role was as Honey, the fragile, neurotic young wife of George Segal&#x27;s character, in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966). Directed by Mike Nichols and starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the film was a huge critical and commercial success and Dennis won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role.

Dennis returned to the stage in a production of &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1966) with Geraldine Page and Kim Stanley that went to London and was filmed.

Dennis&#x27; first lead role in a movie was in &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; (1967), directed by Robert Mulligan. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther cited her for &quot;a vivid performance of emotional range and depth … engagingly natural, sensitive, literate and thoroughly moving.&quot; The film was a box-office success, as was &quot;The Fox&quot; (1967), directed by Mark Rydell, despite its controversial subject matter. In 1967 Dennis was voted the 18th biggest star in the US.

Dennis briefly returned to Broadway to star in &quot;Daphne in Cottage D&quot; (1967), which had a short run.

She starred in &quot;Sweet November&quot; (1968) as a woman who takes multiple lovers, and made a TV version of the play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1968).

Dennis went to London to star in &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; (1969), alternately titled &quot;Thank You All Very Much&quot; in the USA, which flopped at the box office. &quot;That Cold Day in the Park&quot; (1969) did not fare much better, despite being directed by Robert Altman. &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970), a Neil Simon comedy with Jack Lemmon, was a hit.

===Television and supporting roles===
Dennis made a TV movie with Stuart Whitman, &quot;Only Way Out Is Dead&quot; (1970). She returned to Broadway for &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot; (1971) by Alan Ayckbourn, which ran for over 100 performances, then did another TV movie &quot;Something Evil&quot; (1972), directed by Steven Spielberg, which drew a mixed reception.

&quot;Let Me Hear You Smile&quot; (1973) on Broadway only lasted one performance, but &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; (1974–76) was a big hit, running 591 performances.

In 1974 she played Joan of Arc in the pilot of &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot;, Patrick Watson&#x27;s series of interviews with great figures out of the past.

Dennis was in &quot;Mr. Sycamore&quot; (1975) with Jason Robards and had a small role in the low-budget horror film &quot;God Told Me To&quot; (1976) by Larry Cohen. Her performance in the British comedy &quot;Nasty Habits&quot; (1977) drew harsh criticism from Vincent Canby in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Dennis guest starred in &quot;Police Story&quot; (&quot;Day of Terror... Night of Fear&quot;, 1978), and starred in the TV movies &quot;Perfect Gentlemen&quot; (1979) (written by Nora Ephron), and &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Reward&quot; (1981). On Broadway she briefly joined the cast of the long-running &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;.

She had a well-received part in Alan Alda&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981) and was in &quot;The Supporting Cast&quot; (1981) on Broadway for Gene Saks. She was in the stage production and film version of Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; (1982).

===Later career===
In the mid- and late 1980s, Dennis acted less, owing to growing health problems. She appeared on TV in &quot;Young People&#x27;s Specials&quot; (&quot;The Trouble with Mother&quot;, 1985), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (&quot;Roommates/Heartbreaker/Out of the Blue&quot;, 1985), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Arthur, or the Gigolo&quot;, 1985) and &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (&quot;Out of the Past&quot;, 1986). In motion pictures, she had supporting roles in a 1986 remake of &quot;Laughter in the Dark&quot;, which was never completed, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988), and the horror films &quot;976-EVIL&quot; (1989) and &quot;Parents&quot; (1989).

Her final role was in the crime drama &quot;The Indian Runner&quot;, filmed in 1990 and released in 1991. The movie marked Sean Penn&#x27;s debut as a film director. Actor Viggo Mortensen, who played one of her two sons, wrote of the preparations for the movie and filming in the vicinity of Omaha, Nebraska:

==Personal life==
Dennis lived with prominent jazz musician Gerry Mulligan from 1965 to 1974. In October 1965, her hometown newspaper, &quot;The Lincoln Star&quot;, published an Associated Press article stating she and Mulligan had married in Connecticut in June of that year. In a 1989 interview with &quot;People&quot;, however, Dennis admitted that they only pretended to be married after she unintentionally became pregnant. Dennis miscarried, adding, &quot;If I&#x27;d been a mother, I would have loved the child, but I just didn&#x27;t have any connection with it when I was pregnant ... I never, ever wanted children. It would have been like having an elephant.&quot;

From 1980 to 1985, Dennis lived with actor Eric Roberts, 19 years her junior. On June 4, 1981, her German Shepherd was riding with Roberts when he crashed his vehicle into a tree. Roberts, who was under the influence of cocaine at the time, was in a coma for 72 hours and had to withdraw from the Broadway show &quot;Mass Appeal&quot;. Dennis&#x27; dog survived the accident. She and Roberts were engaged to be married in spring 1983, but the ceremony never took place.

Dennis&#x27; sexual orientation was subjected to public discussion as early as 1968, when the scandal magazine &quot;Uncensored&quot; ran a story that labeled her a lesbian. In an article published less than four years after Dennis&#x27; death, Eric Roberts identified her as bisexual. According to Roberts, Dennis told him she had many lesbian relationships and that she &quot;appreciated the beauty of women. But she also liked and appreciated what a very, very young man could do to a woman, I suppose.&quot;

During Dennis&#x27; lifetime, in-depth published interviews with her, such as one with &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; during her stint performing in an ensemble cast at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1981, made no mention of close relationships with women. That interview included the following exchange about her marital status:

Dennis also dated actor Gerald S. O&#x27;Loughlin.

==Death==
Dennis died from ovarian cancer on March 2, 1992, at her home in Westport, Connecticut, at age 54.

<text>Kirundo Province is one of the eighteen provinces of Burundi, in north of the country bordering Rwanda.
The economy is mostly based on agriculture, with a dispersed population and few sizable communities.
Before 1970 large parts of the province were forested. Migrants from the south then cleared much of the vegetation to create agricultural land, and Kirundo became the breadbasket of Burundi.
The civil war from 1993 to 2005 caused agricultural output to drop by more than half.
Since then, lack of farm inputs, poor infrastructure and shortages of water have caused widespread poverty.

==Geography==
Kirundo Province is in the north of Burundi, bounded to the north and west by Rwanda.
It is bounded to the southwest by Ngozi Province, and to the south and east by Muyinga Province.
It has an area of , or 6.1% of the area of Burundi, making it the 8th largest province.

===Bugesera natural region===
88% of the province is in the Bugesera natural region.
This is a vast batholithic depression carved out of granite rocks.
The central plateau has an altitude of , and the north is lower, with an average altitude of .
The Bugesera region is part of the Kirundo district, a depression in the inter-lacustrine zone of East Africa that extends across northeastern Burundi and southeastern Rwanda.
It is bounded to the west by the Kanyaru River valley. To the north, east and south it is bounded by dissected plateaus that rise above it.
The depression contains large valleys holding Holocene sediments, swamps and shallow lakes.

===Bweru natural region===

12% of the province is in the Bweru natural region, including the Commune of Vumbi and the south of the Commune of Gitobe.
The Bweru natural region in the south of the province is mountainous.
The region is known for its agricultural fertility.

===Lakes===
Kirundo Province has eight lakes: Rweru, Cohoha, Rwihinda, Kanzigiri, Gacamirindi, Nagitamo, Narungazi and Mwungere.
The lakes are marshy, with an average depth of . 
All eight lakes are important bird habitats, with 60 species identified in Lake Rwihinda alone.
They provide a variety of fish to the surrounding populations.
The wetlands leading out of and into many of the lakes are irrigated for rice and sugar cane fields, and the surrounding hillsides are developed for diverse agricultural production.
Wetlands include Rugamura Marsh, Kabuyenge Marsh and Nyavyamo Marsh.
Nyamabuno Marsh (&quot;marais de Nyamabuno&quot;).

===Conservation===
The Lacs du Nord Aquatic Landscape Protected Area was created in 2006, in theory conserving over , or 14.2 of Burundi&#x27;s interior waters, up from 0.2%.
The stated goals are integrated community management, agricultural production, and lake conservation.
The protected aquatic landscape integrates the integrated Natural Reserve of Murehe; the managed Reserves of Lake Rwihinda, Lake Rweru and Lake Cohoha; and the integrated protected zones of Lakes Gacamirinda, Mwungere, Nagitamo, and Kanzigiri.
In October 2023 the Inades-Formation Burundi held a workshop on water resource management with local leaders in the capital of Kirundo Province to celebrate World Food Day. It was noted that although the 2012 water code encouraged good practices and penalized violations, some of the lakes still suffered from pollution and unsustainable illegal fishing.

Protected units are:
==Climate==
The province experiences the same wet and dry seasons as the rest of Burundi.
The southeasterly monsoon brings rain in February–May, and the northeasterly monsoon brings rain in September–November.
Natural vegetation includes shrubs, savanna and marshland, important for its value in groundwater storage.
Expansion of farmland continues to damage this vegetation and the forest plantations.
The Bugesera natural region has temperatures that vary from , with average annual rainfall of .
The Bweru natural region has a slightly different climate from Bugesera natural region, with rainfall over annually, and a shorter dry season lasting 5 to 6 months.

==Name==
Kirundo Province was formerly called Muharuro.
During battles between the Rwandans and Barundi in Muharuro in 1763 at Mount Shinge and Mount Rugero, near the provincial capital, the Rwandans were decisively defeated through tactics of the troops of King Mutaga Senyamwiza. The province took its current name of Kirundo (pile) from the piles of corpses of Rwandans killed there in the battle.

==Administration==
===Communes===

Kirundo Province is divided administratively into the communes of Bugabira, Busoni, Bwambarangwe, Gitobe, Kirundo, Ntega and Vumbi. These in turn are divided into 193 &quot;collines&quot;. 
Each commune is headed by an administrator.
The population is scattered, and the small city of Kirundo is the only urban settlement.
Kirundo Province has one of the higher rates of population growth in Burundi.
As of 2008, when the last census was taken, the commune populations and areas were:

===Health districts===

The province is divided into four health districts (): 

There are hospitals in the Kirundo and Mukenke health districts, and health centers (), CDSs, distributed throughout the health districts.
Most health centers are public (), but some are run by religious organizations (). 

===Governors===
The governor of the province must be Burundian and must live in Kirundo or come from Kirundo. 
The governor is appointed by the President of Burundi after confirmation by the Senate.
A partial list of governors of the province:
===Senators===
==Economy==

Until 1970 some of the communes of Kirundo province had few people and were covered in forest.
Then migrants from Ngozi and Kayanza came to the province and cleared the forests to create arable land.
Farmers in Kirundo province produced goods for sale in the markets.
Kirundo was the &quot;breadbasket of Burundi&quot; and supplied agricultural products such as cereals and legumes to the rest of the country before the Burundian Civil War of 1993–2005.

The Burundi Tobacco Company (BTC) was founded in 1979 by Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa.
In 1982 it made an agreement with farmers in Cibitoke Province and Kirundo Province to supply seed, fertilizer, pesticides, crop extension services, drying and processing, and to buy their tobacco at a price agreed upon in advance.
The result was rapid growth in the number of tobacco farmers and the quantity produced.
In the 1980s, BTC started to clear large areas of forest to supply wood to the ovens used to dry tobacco, but did not undertake reforestation.

Between 1996 and 2009, agricultural output dropped by 53.9%.
Poverty has increased and there are high levels of malnutrition.
The farmers have turned to farming for consumption by the family. 
Reasons for this change include inadequate labor, agricultural equipment and agricultural inputs, poor protection of the soil, persistent conflicts over land ownership and lack of microcredit.
The poor roads also contribute to the high levels of poverty in the province.
In 2008 the OPEC Fund for International Development announced a project to build a paved road running from the city of Kirundo to Gasenyi and the border with Rwanda. The project would also includes upgrades to feeder roads and social infrastructure.

In November 2021 Cyriaque Nshimirimana, Second Deputy-Speaker of the Senate of Burundi, met leaders of the province in the capital of the Commune of Ntega.
His audience included heads of provincial and municipal services, &quot;colline&quot; chiefs, leaders of the Sangwe cooperatives and religious leaders.
He urged them to preserve peace and security, fight drunkenness, polygamy, unwanted pregnancies and corruption, limit births, send their children to school, continue to build the offices of colline chiefs and join cooperatives to accomplish development projects together.
He advised the leaders of cooperatives to be fiscally prudent and transparent.
Concerns raised by the audience included the need to repair the Rurata–Ntega road, the lack of teachers and teaching materials in the vocational schools, and the lack of a regional branch of the &quot;Banque d’Investissement pour les Jeunes&quot; (Investment Bank for Youth).

<text>Michael Garver Oxley (February 11, 1944 – January 1, 2016) was an American Republican politician and attorney who served as a U.S. Representative from the 4th congressional district of Ohio.

==Early life and career ==
Oxley was born in Findlay, Ohio, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Miami University in 1966 and a Juris Doctor degree from Ohio State University in 1969. He was a member of the Alpha chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity at Miami.

From 1969 to 1972, Oxley worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and became active in the Ohio Republican Party. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1973 to 1981.

==Congress ==
Oxley was elected a U.S. Representative in 1981 in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative Tennyson Guyer. Oxley began serving at this post in June 1981 in the 97th Congress.

He served as the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, and was House sponsor of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which enacted &quot;sweeping post-Enron regulations of publicly traded companies.&quot; He was also the House sponsor of a 2006 bill that condemned media outlets that had published information on a covert financial surveillance system.

Oxley announced his retirement from Congress on November 1, 2005, effective at the end of his term in 2007. He was succeeded by Republican Jim Jordan.

==Post-congressional career==
Following his retirement from Congress, Oxley was named a nonexecutive vice chairman for NASDAQ, and a partner at the law firm of BakerHostetler in Washington, D.C. He later became a lobbyist for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the &quot;self-regulatory body of the securities industry.&quot;

Oxley, a non-smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer around 2006, and became a member of the Lung Cancer Alliance board. He died in McLean, Virginia, on January 1, 2016, from the disease.

==Honors==
The Findlay post office is named for Oxley and the portion of U.S. Route 30 within Hancock County is designated &quot;Congressman Michael G. Oxley Memorial Highway&quot;.

<doc id="766834" wikidata="Q587650" url="?curid=766834" title="Self-ownership">
<text>Self-ownership, also known as sovereignty of the individual or individual sovereignty, is the concept of property in one&#x27;s own person, expressed as the moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity and be the exclusive controller of one&#x27;s own body and life. Self-ownership is a central idea in several political philosophies that emphasize individualism, such as libertarianism, liberalism, and anarchism.

== Definitional issues ==
=== The self ===
American libertarian socialist Stephen Pearl Andrews frequently discussed the sovereignty of the individual in his writings. In &quot;The Science of Society&quot;, he says that Protestantism, democracy and socialism are &quot;three partial announcements of one generic principle&quot; which is &quot;the sovereignty of the individual&quot;. Andrews considered the sovereignty of the individual to be &quot;the basis of harmonious intercourse amongst equals, precisely as the equal Sovereignty of States is the basis of harmonious intercourse between nations mutually recognizing their independence of each other.&quot;

Discussion of the boundary of self with respect to ownership and responsibility has been explored by legal scholar Meir Dan-Cohen in his essays on &quot;The Value of Ownership&quot; and &quot;Responsibility and the Boundaries of the Self&quot;. The emphasis of this work illuminates the phenomenology of ownership and our common usage of personal pronouns to apply to both body and propertythis serves as the folk basis for legal conceptions and debates about responsibility and ownership. Another view holds that labor is alienable because it can be contracted out, thus alienating it from the self. In this view, the choice of a person to voluntarily sell oneself into slavery is also preserved by the principle of self-ownership.

=== Labour markets and private property ===
For anarcho-communist political philosopher L. Susan Brown: &quot;Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism&#x27;s competitive property relations&quot;. Scholar Ellen Meiksins Wood says that &quot;there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to Lockean individualism... and non-Lockean individualism may encompass socialism&quot;.

Right-libertarian conceptions of self-ownership extend the concept to include control of private property as part of the self. According to Gerald Cohen, &quot;the libertarian principle of self-ownership says that each person enjoys, over herself and her powers, full and exclusive rights of control and use, and therefore owes no service or product to anyone else that she has not contracted to supply&quot;.

Philosopher Ian Shapiro says that labor markets affirm self-ownership because if self-ownership were not recognized, then people would not be allowed to sell the use of their productive capacities to others. He says that the individual sells the use of his productive capacity for a limited time and conditions but continues to own what he earns from selling the use of that capacity and the capacity itself, thereby retaining sovereignty over himself while contributing to economic efficiency. A common view within classical liberalism is that sovereign-minded individuals usually assert a right of private property external to the body, reasoning that if a person owns themselves, they own their actions, including those that create or improve resources, therefore they own their own labour and the fruits thereof.

In &quot;Human Action&quot;, Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises argues that labor markets are the rational conclusion of self-ownership and argues that collective ownership of labor ignores differing values for the labor of individuals:

Other scholars are critical of the idea of private property, specifically within anarchism. The anarchist Oscar Wilde said:

Within anarchism, the concept of wage slavery refers to a situation perceived as quasi-voluntary slavery, where a person&#x27;s livelihood depends on wages, especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a negatively connoted term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person. The term &quot;wage slavery&quot; has been used to criticize economic exploitation and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops) and the latter as a lack of workers&#x27; self-management, fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use while Luddites emphasized the dehumanization brought about by machines. Emma Goldman famously denounced &quot;wage slavery&quot; by saying: &quot;The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves&quot;.

Within left-libertarianism, scholars such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka and David Ellerman root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and land appropriation, combined with geoist or physiocratic views regarding the ownership of land and natural resources (e.g. those of John Locke and Henry George). Left-libertarians &quot;maintain that the world&#x27;s natural resources were initially unowned or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property&quot;. This position is articulated in contrast to the position of other libertarians who argue for a right to appropriate parts of the external world based on sufficient use, even if this homesteading yields unequal results. Some left-libertarians of the Steiner–Vallentyne type support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources.

== History ==
John Locke wrote in his &quot;Two Treatises on Government&quot; that &quot;every man has a Property in his own Person&quot;. Libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick interprets Locke as saying that the individual &quot;has a right to decide what would become of himself and what he would do, and as having a right to reap the benefits of what he did&quot;. Josiah Warren was the first who wrote about the &quot;sovereignty of the individual&quot;.

<text>Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, SDB (, born 13 January 1932) is a retired Chinese cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as Bishop of Hong Kong from 2002 to 2009. He was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 and has been outspoken on issues regarding human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty.

Zen&#x27;s strong ties with the pro-democracy camp often attract criticism from the pro-Beijing camp and the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He retired on 15 April 2009, but remains a strong pro-democracy influence in Hong Kong. On 11 May 2022 he was arrested by the National Security Police and later that day released on bail.

== Early life and career ==

Joseph Zen was born in Shanghai to Catholic parents, Vincent Zen and Margaret Tseu. He studied in a church school during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was sent to an abbey after his father suffered a stroke.

Zen fled to Hong Kong from Shanghai to escape Communist rule at the end of the Chinese Civil War. After entering the Salesians at the Hong Kong novitiate in 1948, he was ordained to the priesthood on 11 February 1961 by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati. Zen obtained a licentiate in theology (1961) and a doctorate in philosophy (1964) from the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. After 1973, he taught in the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Hong Kong – 1976 to 1978 of Macao Salesian School (Instituto Salesiano) as principal. In 1978 he became the Provincial Superior of Salesians (which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), then resigned in 1983. He was a lecturer in the seminaries in China, centres of studies acknowledged by the Communist party, between 1989 and 1996. He was appointed the coadjutor Bishop of Hong Kong in 1996 by Pope John Paul II.

===Retirement===
On 18 September 2005, he told Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Apple Daily&quot; reporters that he was willing to retire in January 2007. He also said that he wanted to be a teacher in either mainland China or in Africa, as there was a shortage of teachers in Africa. Democratic Party ex-chairman Martin Lee, also a Roman Catholic, stated that because Zen was still healthy for his age, the Pope may request him to stay in his position. Legislative Council member Audrey Eu praised Zen for being braver than other religious leaders in Hong Kong in sharing his political views and also because &quot;he carried out his ideas of fairness, equitableness, and philanthropy via actual efforts&quot;. On the other hand, some conservatives inside the church speculated that the strained relationship between Beijing and the Holy See will become more relaxed if Zen retires. Nonetheless, Zen wrote a letter to the Pope on 13 January 2006 and stated that he did want to retire from his position, though not because of his age. On 15 April 2009, Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Zen&#x27;s resignation and John Tong Hon became the bishop of the diocese.

From 22 October 2011 for three days Cardinal Zen went on hunger strike which was undertaken as an act of protest against losing a long-standing legal battle with the Hong Kong government over how aided schools should be run. He later wrote about his experiences in an open letter.

===Cardinalate===
On 22 February 2006, the Vatican announced that Zen would be elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory on 24 March 2006. Zen, who was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Madre del Redentore a Tor Bella Monaca, saw his elevation as indication of how much the Pope values the Church in China. He was named a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.

Bishop Zen&#x27;s elevation was welcomed by Catholics in Hong Kong as it was seen as a recognition of the bishop&#x27;s stance on social justice and as an honour for the church in Hong Kong. Vicar General Dominic Chan Chi-ming said that it would be an honour to have a cardinal to once again head the diocese. Rev. Louis Ha Ke-loon said it shows that the Pope feels that Bishop Zen should speak out. Democrat legislator Martin Lee added that it was good news because no matter whether he is a bishop or a cardinal, as a religious leader Zen speaks as moral voice of the people.

At the time of his elevation, Zen was the only Chinese cardinal eligible to participate in papal conclaves. His elevation can be seen as giving hope to the underground Catholic Church in China.

Cardinal Zen offered a Pontifical High Mass in the Tridentine Rite in May 2006, for which he was thanked by traditionalist Catholics around the world.

Pope Benedict XVI named Cardinal Zen to write the meditations for the Stations of the Cross led by the Pope at the Roman Colisseum on Good Friday, 21 March 2008.

In August 2023,Cardinal Brandmüller, along with Cardinals Burke, Íñiguez, Sarah, and Zen, submitted another list of five &quot;dubia&quot; to Pope Francis related to the upcoming Synod on Synodality. The &quot;Dubia&quot; questioned the necessity of the upcoming synod, asked whether the blessing of same-sex unions was theologically admissible, and questioned the Pope&#x27;s claim that &quot;forgiveness is a human right&quot;.

Cardinal Zen criticized some of Pope Francis’ responses to five dubia, saying that the Pope&#x27;s guidance on the blessing of same-sex unions is “pastorally untenable.”

===Relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China===
In October 2011, Zen said that he had received HK$20 million from Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai since 2005, which went to helping the underground Church and the poor on the mainland.

In 2014 Cardinal Zen Ze-kiun asked Pope Francis not to visit China, saying the pontiff would be “manipulated”. In an interview he told the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;: “I would tell him now, ‘Don’t come, you would be manipulated&#x27;. The few courageous [Catholics] could not meet [the Pope], and the Communist Party would show him the illegitimate bishops, including the three excommunicated ones.” The comments came as ties between the Vatican and China improved in the early days of the pontificate of Francis, with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulating Francis on his election. Cardinal Zen said he did not see signs of dialogue happening between the Catholic Church and China. “Even if under these conditions Beijing was to extend a hand, it would be a trick under these circumstances,” he said. “Our poor bishops are slaves, the Communist Party denies them respect, tries to take away their dignity.”

In September 2014 as part of the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Cardinal Zen addressed the protesters saying &quot;It&#x27;s high time we really showed that we want to be free and not to be slaves. We must unite together&quot;. During his speech protesters were fired on with tear gas and he asked them to disperse.

In a 2018 interview, Cardinal Zen, on Sino-Holy See relations, said “Pope Francis does not know the real Communist Party in China, but Parolin should know. He was there [in the Secretariat of State] so many years, so he must know. He may be happy to encourage the pope to be optimistic about the negotiations … but that’s dangerous. Pope Francis needs someone to calm him down from his enthusiasm.” Zen added that “It seems the Secretary of State wants to have a solution anyway. He is so optimistic. That’s dangerous. I told the pope that he [Parolin] has a poisoned mind. He is very sweet, but I have no trust in this person. He believes in diplomacy, not in our faith.”

In 2019, Zen responded to Cardinal Filoni&#x27;s weeklong trip to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. Cardinal Filoni said that the provisional agreement between Beijing and the Holy See signed in 2018 “will be a very good thing for the Church in the future, and also for China.” Zen suggested that “One wonders: from which planet did our leaders in Rome descend?” Zen, the emeritus bishop of Hong Kong, responded on his blog on 5 March. Zen added that “The incredible thing is the invitation to trust the government! Is information on recent oppression measures missing from our superiors in the Vatican?” Zen later expressed a desire to tell Pope Francis that the pontiff&#x27;s actions were &quot;encouraging a schism&quot; by &quot;legitimizing the schismatic church in China.&quot;

During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, Zen criticized Pope Francis after he was quoted as saying that he loved China and would like to visit and condemned his lack of stance against China.

On May 11, 2022, Hong Kong police arrested Zen and four others who helped run the disbanded 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund for protesters, all on the charge of &quot;collusion with foreign forces&quot;. The others who were arrested were senior barrister Margaret Ng, activist and pop singer Denise Ho, former lawmaker Cyd Ho, and former academic Hui Po-keung. Zen was held and questioned in Chai Wan police station close to his church residence. Zen was released on bail and had his passport confiscated after interrogation. After his initial arrest, the Holy See press office stated that they were concerned and following the situation closely. Karine Jean-Pierre called upon the PRC to immediately release Zen and the others arrested, and former U.S. Congressman Dan Lipinski attacked the Chinese government over the move. American bishops Thomas Joseph Tobin and Joseph Strickland both called for prayers for Zen&#x27;s release. In the U.K., British minister James Cleverly called the arrests unacceptable in a statement given before Parliament. Vatican&#x27;s Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said the arrest of Zen should not be read as disavowal of Sino-Vatican agreement.

==Views==
===Advocacy for democracy===
After he succeeded as Bishop of Hong Kong on 23 September 2002, he led the Diocese in voicing reservations about the proposed anti-subversion laws, required under Article 23 of the Basic Law. He was worried that these laws, if enacted without a thorough consultation process including a white paper, could easily lead to future violations of basic civil rights.

On 1 July 2003, he took part in a prayer gathering at Victoria Park before the 1 July March began. Many Christians, including Catholics and those of other denominations, attended the demonstration.

Cardinal Zen attended the 4 June 2006 Prayer gathering in memory of the victims of the 1989 massacre. He asked the Chinese government to let the Chinese people freely discuss the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In September 2023 he also attended the trial of pro-democracy media tycoon and founder of influential tabloid Apple Daily Jimmy Lai.

===Education reform controversies===

On 5 June 2005, Zen announced that if the Legislative Council passed a proposal to support the schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. The Education (Amendment) Bill 2002, once enacted, would likely play down the role of the Church in running Catholic schools and in promoting Catholic education. However, after the Government gave up some argued points in the motion, the Diocese decided to support the motion, though the Diocese later announced plans to prosecute the Government on 28 September 2005.

After two teachers committed suicide in early January 2006, Zen said that these acts must be due to the educational reforms and he asked the government to halt new reforms. Then Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower Fanny Law rejected causal connections, but provoked furor among teachers and the public when she questioned why only two teachers committed suicide because of the reforms. She apologised for her &quot;inappropriate&quot; remarks on 10 January.

===Tridentine Mass===
In 2021, Zen criticized Pope Francis&#x27;s motu proprio &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, stating that &quot;Many tendentious generalizations in the documents [of the motu proprio] have hurt the hearts of many good people more than expected.&quot; He added that he believed that many people who had been hurt by the restrictions &quot;have never given the smallest reason to be suspected of not accepting the liturgical reform of the [Second Vatican Council].&quot;

===WTO affairs===
On 18 December 2005, Zen visited protesters at the 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference and tried to visit the detained South Korean Catholics, including two priests and a nun. He criticised the Hong Kong police for their treatment of the protesters. About one month later, several unions in Hong Kong Police Force decided to write a letter to the Pope to complain about Zen&#x27;s speech. Zen replied that some policemen were &quot;sycophantic to the senior officers inside the police force&quot;.

<doc id="766840" wikidata="Q1413080" url="?curid=766840" title="Alien Tort Statute">
<text>The Alien Tort Statute (codified in 1948 as ; ATS), also called the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), is a section in the United States Code that gives federal courts jurisdiction over lawsuits filed by foreign nationals for torts committed in violation of international law. It was first introduced by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and is one of the oldest federal laws still in effect in the U.S.

The ATS was rarely cited for nearly two centuries after its enactment, and its exact purpose and scope remain debated. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Act&#x27;s primary purpose as &quot;[promoting] harmony in international relations by ensuring foreign plaintiffs a remedy for international-law violations in circumstances where the absence of such a remedy might provoke foreign nations to hold the United States accountable.&quot;

Since 1980, courts have generally interpreted the ATS to allow foreign nationals to seek remedies in U.S. courts for human rights violations committed outside the United States, provided there is a sufficient connection to the United States. Both case law and jurisprudence differ on what characterizes a sufficient U.S. connection, particularly with respect to corporate entities.

==Text==
The statute reads as follows:

==History==
The ATS was part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was passed by the First U.S. Congress to establish the federal court system. There is little surviving legislative history regarding the Act, and its original meaning and purpose are uncertain. Scholars have surmised that it was intended to assure foreign governments that the U.S. would seek to prevent and remedy breaches of customary international law, especially breaches concerning diplomats and merchants.

The ATS may have been enacted in response to a number of international incidents caused by the unavailability of remedies for foreign citizens in the U.S. The peace treaty ending the American Revolutionary War provided for the satisfaction of debts to British creditors, but several states refused to enforce the payment of such debts, prompting threats of retaliation by Great Britain. In 1784, French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois was assaulted in Philadelphia, but no legal remedy was available to him, as any prosecution was left to the discretion of local authorities. The incident was notorious internationally and prompted Congress to draft a resolution asking states to allow suits in tort for the violation of the law of nations; few states enacted such a provision, and Congress subsequently included the ATS in the Judiciary Act of 1789.

However, until 1980 the ATS remained largely dormant, being invoked in only two reported court decisions.

===Revitalization: &quot;Filartiga v. Pena-Irala&quot;===

In 1980, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided &quot;Filártiga v. Peña-Irala&quot;, which &quot;paved the way for a new conceptualization of the ATS&quot;. In &quot;Filartiga&quot;, two Paraguayan citizens resident in the U.S., represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, brought suit against a Paraguayan former police chief who was also living in the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had tortured and murdered a member of their family, and they asserted that U.S. federal courts had jurisdiction over their suit under the ATS. The district court dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that the &quot;law of nations&quot; does not regulate a state&#x27;s treatment of its own citizens.

The Second Circuit reversed the decision of the district court. First, it held that the ATS, which allowed jurisdiction in the federal courts over a suit between two aliens, was a constitutional exercise of Congress&#x27;s power, because &quot;the law of nations...has always been part of the federal common law&quot;, and thus the statute fell within federal-question jurisdiction. Second, the court held that the contemporary law of nations had expanded to prohibit state-sanctioned torture. The court found that multilateral treaties and domestic prohibitions on torture evidenced a consistent state practice of proscribing official torture. The court similarly found that United Nations declarations, such as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, manifested an expectation of adherence to the prohibition of official torture. The court therefore held that the right to be free from torture had become a principle of customary international law. However, one of the judges on the panel hearing the case later wrote that &quot;Filartiga&quot; &quot;should not be misread or exaggerated to support sweeping assertions that all (or even most) international human rights norms found in the Universal Declaration or in international human rights treaties have ripened into customary international law enforceable in the domestic courts&quot;.

Since &quot;Filartiga&quot;, jurisdiction under the ATS has been upheld in dozens of cases.

===First U.S. Supreme Court hearing: &quot;Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain&quot;===

The first U.S. Supreme Court case to directly address the scope of the ATS was &quot;Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain&quot; in 2004. The plaintiff, Alvarez, brought a claim under ATS for arbitrary arrest and detention. He had been indicted in the United States for torturing and murdering a Drug Enforcement Administration officer. When the United States was unable to secure Alvarez&#x27;s extradition, the United States paid Sosa, a Mexican national, to kidnap Alvarez and bring him into the U.S. Alvarez claimed that his &quot;arrest&quot; by Sosa was arbitrary because the warrant for his arrest only authorized his arrest within the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that Alvarez&#x27;s abduction constituted arbitrary arrest in violation of international law.

The Supreme Court reversed and clarified that ATS did not create a cause of action, but instead merely &quot;furnish[ed] jurisdiction for a relatively modest set of actions alleging violations of the law of nations.&quot; Such actions must &quot;rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms we have recognized.&quot; Although the scope of ATS is not limited to violations of international law recognized in the 18th century, with respect to recognizing contemporary international norms, the Court&#x27;s opinion stated that &quot;the judicial power should be exercised on the understanding that the door is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping.&quot;

In Alvarez&#x27;s case, &quot;a single illegal detention of less than a day, followed by the transfer of custody to lawful authorities and a prompt arraignment, violates no norm of customary international law so well defined as to support the creation of a federal remedy.&quot;

===Ongoing controversy===
Exercising legal jurisdiction in the United States over matters that occurred abroad is a controversial practice and some have suggested that Congress eliminate it. Others believe that a multilateral solution, including through either the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or the UN, would be more appropriate.

==Scope of the statute==

===&quot;Violation of the Law of Nations&quot;===
The Supreme Court held in &quot;Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain&quot; that the ATS provides a cause of action for violations of international norms that are as &quot;specific, universal, and obligatory&quot; as were the norms prohibiting violations of safe conducts, infringements of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy in the 18th century. Courts have found torture; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; genocide; war crimes; crimes against humanity; summary execution; prolonged arbitrary detention; and forced disappearance to be actionable under the ATS.

Since &quot;Sosa&quot;, courts have struggled to define the level of specificity required for a norm to be actionable under the ATS. For example, subsequent to &quot;Sosa&quot;, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit overturned prior lower-court decisions that had found cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment actionable, noting that &quot;Sosa&quot; repudiated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as a source of law under the ATS. Similarly, courts have held that economic, social, and cultural rights are too indeterminate to satisfy &quot;Sosa&quot;&#x27;s specificity requirement. For example, in &quot;Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corp.&quot;, the Second Circuit stated that the rights to life and to health are too indeterminate to constitute a cause of action under the ATS.

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, however, has held that the limits of a norm need not be defined with particularity to be actionable; rather, the norm need only be so defined that the particular acts upon which a claim is based certainly fall within the bounds of the norm. In &quot;Doe v. Qi&quot;, the court stated, &quot;The fact that there may be doubt at the marginsa fact that inheres in any definitiondoes not negate the essence and application of that definition in clear cases.&quot; The court also described how to determine whether specific actions fall within the proscriptions of an international norm, holding that the actions alleged should be compared with actions that international adjudicatory bodies have found to be proscribed by the norm in question. It therefore examined decisions by institutions such as the Human Rights Committee, the European Court of Human Rights, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights to determine that pushing, hitting, and choking a plaintiff during one day of incarceration did not constitute cruel, unusual, or degrading treatment, whereas forcing a hand into a plaintiff&#x27;s vagina did constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

===Corporate liability under the statute===
In 2011, there was a circuit split regarding whether corporations, as opposed to natural people, could be held liable under the ATS. In 2010 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held in &quot;Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.&quot; that &quot;customary international law has steadfastly rejected the notion of corporate liability for international crimes&quot; and thus that &quot;insofar as plaintiffs bring claims under the ATS against corporations, plaintiffs fail to allege violations of the law of nations, and plaintiffs&#x27; claims fall outside the limited jurisdiction provided by the ATS&quot;. However, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals all ruled that corporate liability is possible under the statute.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted &quot;certiori&quot; on October 17, 2011, to answer the question of corporate liability. After arguments on February 28, 2012, the Court ordered the case to be reargued the following term on the separate question of extraterritoriality. On April 17, 2013, in &quot;Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.&quot;, the Court issued a decision affirming the Second Circuit&#x27;s decision, but on different grounds, holding that the ATS did not create jurisdiction for a claim regarding conduct occurring outside the territory of the United States, leaving the question of corporate liability unresolved.

In &quot;Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC&quot;, the Supreme Court again revisited the question of corporate liability and ruled that foreign corporations may not be sued under the ATS. However, the only parts of the opinion that commanded a majority of the court expressly limited its holding to suits against corporations. The concurring opinions by Justices Alito and Gorsuch focused on foreign relations concerns with foreign corporations. Justice Alito expressly limited his concurrence to foreign corporations: &quot;Because this case involves a foreign corporation, we have no need to reach the question whether an alien may sue a United States corporation under the ATS.&quot; Because the majority opinion was limited to foreign corporations, it is possible that &quot;Jesner&quot; does not settle the question of corporate liability for U.S. corporations.

==Prominent cases under the statute==
===&quot;Doe v. Unocal&quot;===
In September 1996, four Burmese villagers filed suit against Unocal and its parent company, the Union Oil Company of California; in October 1996, another fourteen villagers also brought suit. The suits alleged various human rights violations, including forced labor, wrongful death, false imprisonment, assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, all relating to the construction of the Yadana gas pipeline project in Myanmar, formerly Burma.

In 2000, the district court dismissed the case on the grounds that Unocal could not be held liable unless Unocal wanted the military to commit abuses, and that plaintiffs had not made this showing. Plaintiffs appealed and ultimately, shortly prior to when the case was to be argued before the Ninth Circuit &quot;en banc&quot; court in December 2004, the parties announced that they had reached a tentative settlement. Once the settlement was finalized in March 2005, the appeal was withdrawn and the district court opinion from 2000 was also vacated.

According to a joint statement released by the parties, while the specific terms were confidential, &quot;the settlement will compensate plaintiffs and provide funds enabling plaintiffs and their representatives to develop programs to improve living conditions, health care and education and protect the rights of people from the pipeline region. These initiatives will provide substantial assistance to people who may have suffered hardships in the region.&quot;

=== &quot;Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC&quot; ===

On April 3, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case &quot;Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC&quot;, which asks the question: &quot;Whether the Alien Tort Statute... categorically forecloses corporate liability.&quot; The case arose when plaintiffs and their families were injured by terrorist attacks in the Middle East over a ten-year period. American nationals brought their claim under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U. S. C. §2333(a), and foreign nationals brought their claim under the ATS. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank helped finance terrorism by allowing Hamas and other terrorist groups to use bank accounts for terrorists and to pay the families of suicide bombers.

The District Court, following the Second Circuit decision in &quot;Kiobel&quot; that corporations are immune from liability under the ATS, dismissed the ATS suit. The Second Circuit, also adhering to &quot;Kiobel&quot;, affirmed.

On April 24, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that foreign corporations may not be sued under the Alien Tort Statute. Justice Kennedy wrote for a splintered majority. In the majority opinion, the Court expressed its concern for foreign relations problems if the Court were to extend liability to foreign corporations. &quot;For 13 years, this litigation has &#x27;caused significant diplomatic tensions&#x27; with Jordan, a critical ally in one of the world&#x27;s most sensitive regions . . . These are the very foreign-relations tensions the First Congress sought to avoid.&quot; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch concurred.

Justice Sotomayor wrote a 34-page dissent, arguing the decision &quot;absolves corporations from responsibility under the ATS for conscience-shocking behavior.&quot; Immunizing corporations from liability &quot;allows these entities to take advantage of the significant benefits of the corporate form and enjoy fundamental rights ... without having to shoulder attendant fundamental responsibilities.&quot;

===&quot;Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum&quot;===

The plaintiffs in &quot;Kiobel&quot; were citizens of Nigeria who claimed that Dutch, British, and Nigerian oil-exploration corporations aided and abetted the Nigerian government during the 1990s in committing violations of customary international law. The plaintiffs claimed that Royal Dutch Shell compelled its Nigerian subsidiary, in cooperation with the Nigerian government, to brutally crush peaceful resistance to aggressive oil development in the Ogoni Niger River Delta. Plaintiffs sought damages under the ATS. The defendants moved to dismiss based on a two-pronged argument. First, they argued that customary international law itself provides the rules by which to decide whether conduct violates the law of nations where non-state actors are alleged to have committed the wrong in question. Second, they contended that no norm has ever existed between nations that imposes liability upon corporate actors. On September 29, 2006, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs&#x27; claims for aiding and abetting property destruction; forced exile; extrajudicial killing; and violation of the rights to life, liberty, security, and association. It reasoned that customary international law did not define those violations with sufficient particularity. The court denied the defendants&#x27; motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining claims of aiding and abetting arbitrary arrest and detention; crimes against humanity; and torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. The district court then certified its entire order for interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit based on the serious nature of the questions at issue.

In a 2–1 decision issued on September 17, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that corporations cannot be held liable for violations of customary international law, finding that: (1) under both U.S. Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents over the previous 30 years that address ATS suits alleging violations of customary international law, the scope of liability is determined by customary international law itself; (2) under Supreme Court precedent, the ATS requires courts to apply norms of international law—and not domestic law—to the scope of defendants&#x27; liabilities. Such norms must be &quot;specific, universal and obligatory&quot;; and (3) under international law, &quot;corporate liability is not a discernible—much less a universally recognized—norm of customary international law&quot;, that the court could apply to the ATS, and that the plaintiffs&#x27; ATS claims should indeed be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Kiobel petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the Second Circuit&#x27;s decision, and this was granted on October 17, 2011. Oral arguments were held on February 28, 2012, The arguments received considerable attention in the legal community. Unexpectedly, the Court announced on March 5, 2012, that it would hold additional arguments on the case during the October 2012 term, and directed the parties to file new briefs on the question &quot;Whether and under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute ... allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.&quot; The case was reargued on October 1, 2012; on April 17, 2013, the Court held that there is a presumption that the ATS does not apply outside the United States.

===&quot;Sarei v. Rio Tinto&quot;===
In 2000, residents of the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea brought suit against multinational mining company Rio Tinto. The lawsuit is based on a 1988 revolt against Rio Tinto, and the plaintiffs allege that the Papua New Guinea government, using Rio Tinto helicopters and vehicles, killed about 15,000 people in an effort to put down the revolt. On October 25, 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting &quot;en banc&quot;, issued a divided opinion holding that certain claims against a foreign corporation implicating the conduct of a foreign government on foreign soil could proceed under the ATS. The company filed a petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the decision; on April 22, 2013, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in the light of its decision in &quot;Kiobel&quot;.

===&quot;Kpadeh v. Emmanuel&quot;===
Charles McArthur Emmanuel (also known as &quot;Chuckie Taylor&quot; or &quot;Taylor Jr.&quot;), the son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, was the commander of the infamously violent Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), commonly known in Liberia as the &quot;Demon Forces&quot;. In 2006, U.S. officials arrested Taylor Jr. upon entering the U.S. (via the Miami International Airport) and the Department of Justice later charged him based on torture he committed in Liberia. He was convicted of multiple counts of torture and conspiracy to torture and was sentenced to 97 years in prison. The World Organization for Human Rights USA and the Florida International University College of Law filed a civil suit in the Southern District of Florida on behalf of five of Taylor Jr.&#x27;s victims pursuant to the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act. The plaintiffs won by default judgment as to liability on all counts, and in February 2010, following trial on damages at which Taylor appeared, the court found Taylor liable to the plaintiffs for damages of over $22 million.

===&quot;Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc.&quot;===
On October 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in &quot;Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc.&quot;, held that &quot;the mens rea standard for aiding and abetting liability in Alien Tort Statute actions is purpose rather than knowledge alone.&quot; In this case—which involves allegations against a Canadian oil company concerning its purported assistance to the government in Sudan in the forced movement of civilians residing near oil facilities—the court concluded that &quot;plaintiffs have not established Talisman&#x27;s purposeful complicity in human rights abuses.&quot; In reaching that conclusion, the Second Circuit stated that &quot;the standard for imposing accessorial liability under the Alien Tort Statute must be drawn from international law; and that under international law a claimant must show that the defendant provided substantial assistance with the purpose of facilitating the alleged offenses.&quot;

===&quot;Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Company&quot;===

On August 11, 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued a decision in &quot;Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Company&quot;. In this case, plaintiffs alleged that Coca-Cola bottlers in Colombia collaborated with Colombian paramilitary forces in &quot;the systematic intimidation, kidnapping, detention, torture, and murder of Colombian trade unionists.&quot; However, the district court dismissed the complaint and the Eleventh Circuit upheld that ruling. In doing so, the Eleventh Circuit relied upon the Supreme Court&#x27;s recent &quot;Ashcroft v. Iqbal&quot; decision in addressing the adequacy of the complaint, which must have &quot;facial plausibility&quot; to survive dismissal, and noted that Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure demands &quot;more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.&quot; The Eleventh Circuit then applied the &quot;Iqbal&quot; standard to plaintiffs&#x27; allegations against Coca-Cola and held that they were insufficient to survive dismissal.

===&quot;Bowoto v. Chevron Corp.&quot;===

Nigerian villagers brought claims against Chevron Corp. regarding events that occurred on a Chevron offshore drilling platform in 1998, when Nigerian soldiers suppressed a protest against Chevron&#x27;s environmental and business practices. The protesters, with the help of nonprofit organizations including the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Public Interest Lawyers Group, and EarthRights International, brought claims for wrongful death, torture, assault, battery, and negligence against Chevron, alleging that the company had paid the soldiers that landed on the platform and were therefore liable for the actions that they took. In December 2008, a jury found that Chevron was not liable.

===&quot;Wang Xiaoning v. Yahoo!&quot;===

In 2007, the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a lawsuit against Yahoo! on behalf of Chinese dissidents Wang Xiaoning and Shi Tao (his mother Gao Qinsheng), claiming jurisdiction under the ATS. According to the complaint, Wang and Shi Tao used Yahoo! accounts to share pro-democracy material, and a Chinese subsidiary of Yahoo! gave the Chinese government identifying information that allowed authorities to identify and arrest them. The Complaint alleged that the plaintiffs were subjected to &quot;torture, cruel, inhuman, or other degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention, and forced labor.&quot;

Yahoo! settled the case in November 2007 for an undisclosed amount of money, and it agreed to cover the plaintiff&#x27;s legal costs as a part of the settlement. In a statement released after the settlement was made public, Yahoo! said that it would &quot;provide &#x27;financial, humanitarian and legal support to these families&#x27; and create a separate &#x27;humanitarian relief fund&#x27; for other dissidents and their families.&quot;

=== &quot;Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe&quot; ===

A recent case concerning the ATS was &quot;John Doe I, et al. v. Nestle,&quot; which was heard by the Supreme Court on December 1, 2020, and decided June 17, 2021. Consolidated with &quot;Cargill, Inc. v. Doe,&quot; the case alleges that Nestle and Cargill aided and abetted forced child labour in the Ivory Coast in connection with the harvesting of cocoa. The applicability of the ATS was interpreted by each circuit individually, with the Ninth and Fourth Circuits in support of investigating Nestle&#x27;s liability, while the Second Circuit maintained that the Statute did not apply to corporate liability. In an 8–1 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. federal judiciary lacked jurisdiction over the case due to neither corporate defendant having sufficient connections to the U.S. beyond &quot;mere corporate presence&quot;.

The &quot;Nestle/Cargill&quot; ruling was assessed by international legal jurists as narrowing the scope of the ATS while failing to clarify whether or how corporate defendants may be liable thereunder. While the Court rejected &quot;general corporate activity&quot;, such as the making of operational decisions, as insufficient U.S.-based conduct to establish jurisdiction under the Statute, it did not specify what activities or ties would meet the requirements. However, the Court rejected the defendants&#x27; argument to narrow the applicability of the ATS to abuses that take place on U.S. soil, and also disagreed with the Trump Administration&#x27;s &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief asserting that there should be no aiding and abetting cause of action under the Statute.
===&quot;Doe v. Cisco&quot;===

On July 3, 2023, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision in &quot;Doe v. Cisco&quot;. In this case, Falun Gong practitioners alleged that they were victims of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party and enabled by the technological assistance of Cisco and two Cisco executives.

The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs&#x27; ATS claims against the Cisco executives. However, it reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ ATS claims against the corporate defendant, Cisco, and the dismissal of claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) against the Cisco executives.

The Ninth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in &quot;Nestle&quot; to conclude that corporations can be held liable under the ATS. Citing the Supreme Court’s ruling in &quot;Sosa&quot;, the court held that aiding and abetting liability is cognizable under the ATS. It ruled that &quot;plaintiffs’ allegations against Cisco were sufficient to meet the applicable aiding and abetting standard.&quot; 

The case was remanded for further proceedings.

<text>The Baghdad Hotel is a large hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, favored by Westerners after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The hotel overlooks the Tigris on its eastern bank.

== History ==
The hotel was bombed on October 12, 2003, when a car rigged with a bomb drove past a checkpoint near the hotel. It drove down a side street before it was fired on by guards and exploded, killing the suicide bomber and six Iraqis.
 Thirty-two other people were wounded, including three U.S. soldiers. Security officials said that concrete barriers absorbed much of the blast, and prevented the car from destroying the hotel. Western journalists, workers, and American and Iraqi members of the Iraqi Governing Council frequently stayed at the hotel.

<text>Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean is a 1982 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Altman. An adaptation of Ed Graczyk&#x27;s 1976 play of the same name, the film stars Sandy Dennis, Cher, Karen Black, Sudie Bond, Mark Patton, and Kathy Bates, all of whom reprise their roles from the 1982 Broadway production of the play which Altman also directed. As with the original play, the film takes place inside a Woolworth&#x27;s five-and-dime store in a small Texas town, where an all-female fan club for actor James Dean reunites in 1975. According to a 2014 interview with playwright Ed Graczyk the setting of the play is actually an H. L. Kressmont &amp; Co. Five and Dime. Through a series of flashbacks, the six members also reveal secrets dating back to 1955.

&quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; was the first of several feature adaptations of plays by Altman in the 1980s, after the director&#x27;s departure from Hollywood. It was screened at various film festivals in North America and Europe, and won the top prize at the 1982 Chicago International Film Festival. It was well-received by critics, who praised Altman&#x27;s direction and the performances by the female cast. This was the first release for New York–based independent outlet Cinecom Pictures, which Altman chose over a major studio &quot;to guarantee a long play&quot; in art-house venues.

==Plot==
Early on September 30, 1975, in McCarthy, Texas, at a Woolworth&#x27;s five-and-dime store, its owner Juanita listens to gospel music on the radio. She gets ready for the day, opens the store, and addresses someone as &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;. The All-Female Fan Club Disciples of James Dean is having a reunion meeting at the store, to honor the twentieth anniversary of the actor&#x27;s death. Disciple Sissy comes in tardy; she had been helping out at the truck stop. Juanita says that more members could arrive soon: Disciple Mona ought to have already been there, but her bus is running far behind schedule. Sissy worries about the weather, as it is &quot;118 degrees in the shade&quot;.

The story flashes back to a stormy night in 1955. Sissy shelters inside the store and asks after three employees who are friends of hers: Mona, Sydney, and Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Qualley. Joe is there, busy stocking new issues of &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine. Mona arrives, having been delayed by the weather. Sissy, Mona, and Joe go up to the front counter and sing the contemporary doo-wop song &quot;Sincerely&quot;. Juanita is chagrined, as she only approves of gospel music.

The main storyline returns. Disciples Stella Mae and Edna Louise make their way to the five-and-dime; they have one of the red jackets that the club members used to wear. Mona joins them and explains that her bus had broken down and required repair. Amidst the excited reunion celebration, she looks at a group picture made with James Dean. Mona recalls the last time that the Disciples—all dressed in their jackets—had come together.

Mona&#x27;s 20-year-old memory segues into another flashback. Mona has recently moved back to McCarthy from college, claiming that the atmosphere at college had inflamed her asthma and led to an attack, with her doctors then advising her to return to McCarthy. Later, the overjoyed Disciples find Sissy and break the news that Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean will be in Marfa, Texas, to film &quot;Giant&quot;—62 miles away from McCarthy. Auditions for extra cast members will be carried out across the area. Mona idolizes Dean and she dreams of playing beside him in the film. Joe drives her to Marfa so she can fulfill her desire.

In the modern storyline, Mona claims that when she went to Marfa, Dean chose her to bear his son, and on that night he fathered her child Jimmy Dean. She says that her boy Jimmy Dean is mentally deficient, and she isolates him from the community. Sissy says that Mona has been &quot;warped and demented&quot; to hide her son. Mona loses her temper and insults Sissy, who goes outside to &quot;cool off&quot;.

A Porsche sports car roars into town and its driver peers in through the storefront window. Mona and Juanita greet the window shopper, who identifies herself as Joanne. She had seen writing on an old highway sign that noted Dean&#x27;s son was to be found at the store. The Disciples learn that Joanne was formerly Joe Qualley, the only male who had been a part of their social circle.

The story flashes back to a young Joanne—as Joe—recounting the events some days after a McCarthy High School dance, which Joe had attended wearing a dress. Leicester T, a boy their age who had an ambiguous tryst with Joanne on that night before finding out she was in fact &#x27;Joe&#x27; crossdressing, assaulted and dragged Joe to a graveyard before proceeding to assault her while locals from the town jeered behind a fence. All this is recounted to Mona and Sissy by a young &#x27;Joe,&#x27; with them tending to the bruises and wounds on his face. Unable to recount what Leicester T proceeded to do whilst spreading him over a gravestone and pulling down his overalls, Joe is only able to scream how he kept calling him Joanne.

The Disciples in 1975 have just heard the story. Stella Mae asks whether Joanne is &quot;half-man, half-woman&quot;—a hermaphrodite, in case people ask. Joanne says that she had a sex-change operation thirteen years ago and, when pressed by Stella, remarks that she can simply call her &#x27;a freak,&#x27; as her friends are more likely to understand the term.

Later that day, Juanita thinks she hears thunder and she warns the Disciples to brace themselves for stormy weather. But the noise was from a loud sports car motor—Mona&#x27;s son Jimmy Dean had stolen Joanne&#x27;s Porsche and was racing its engine. Joanne phones the Texas Highway Patrol to tell them about Jimmy Dean, which triggers a final storyline transition.

The Disciples of yesteryear listen as a man on the radio announces that an automobile accident has killed 24-year-old Hollywood film star James Dean. The girls pledge to hold a vigil.

The 1975 reunion winds down among further questions and answers. Mona remarks again how, as soon as she tried to leave McCarthy, she almost died from asthma attacks, so she has found the town&#x27;s warm and dry atmosphere to be vital. She then goes on to reminisce about her part as an extra on the set of &quot;Giant,&quot; which the others have never been able to find in the film. Meanwhile, certain details from her two accounts combine to clearly indicate that Joanne is in fact the father of Mona&#x27;s son, as Sissy reveals that the young Jimmy Dean has never seen a doctor, and is probably unencumbered by any disability. In the fallout from the revelation, The Disciples drink together, laughing, and make a pact to hold another reunion in another twenty years; Mona alone demurs. Left alone, she, Sissy, and Joanne stand together before the mirrors as they had done before, and again sing &quot;Sincerely&quot; in concert. The song fades into blowing wind over shots of a decrepit, decayed, abandoned five-and-dime store building as the film ends.

==Cast==
==Production==
After directing 1980&#x27;s critically panned &quot;Popeye&quot; and selling his Lion&#x27;s Gate studio (not to be confused with Lionsgate), Altman turned his attention to the stage. One of his first tasks in this field was acquiring and directing Ed Graczyk&#x27;s &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;, a drama originally performed in Columbus, Ohio in 1976. Altman&#x27;s work on the play, despite its bad reviews and short run, convinced him that a film version was imminent. &quot;On stage it was humorous and bawdy,&quot; he commented. &quot;On film it&#x27;s more emotional.&quot; &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; was his first feature adaptation of a play; he followed this effort with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Streamers&quot; and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot;, among others.

Altman then made a deal with the play&#x27;s production executive, Peter Newman, and retained the original cast members. The filmmaker received over US$800,000 from Viacom Enterprises, through game show company Mark Goodson Productions, almost as much money as the play had cost him. It was his intention to shoot &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; for the cinema; &quot;the initial press report that it was made for cable is not true,&quot; he said.

Of his preparations for &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;, Altman added, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do what they told me I had to do, I hired the people I wanted.&quot; The production was his first to involve Pierre Mignot, a Canadian cinematographer; they would collaborate on five more films. Filming took place on just one set: a &quot;redressed&quot; version of its Broadway counterpart. Altman used Super 16 equipment during the nineteen-day shoot; this was later converted to 35 mm stock for the first answer print. For the film&#x27;s flashbacks, he built a double set with two-way mirrors that were controlled by computerized lighting techniques—which became problematic for both him and the film&#x27;s critics.

==Release== 
Altman took &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; to the Montreal and Toronto film festivals in Canada, as well as those in Belgium, Venice and Deauville. The film received its U.S. premiere on September 30, 1982 (the 27th anniversary of the late James Dean&#x27;s death) at the Chicago International Film Festival, where it received a ten-minute standing ovation. After this screening, Altman discussed various aspects of the production during a question-and-answer session.

The filmmaker refused to let any major U.S. studio handle &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;, due to the problems he had with 20th Century-Fox over his 1979 production &quot;HealtH&quot;. Instead, he enlisted Cinecom Pictures, an independent distributor in New York City, to open it in arthouse theaters &quot;to guarantee a long play&quot;; it became the first release for that company.

===Home media===
&quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; aired on the Showtime cable network in May 1983. Embassy Home Entertainment released it on VHS that same year, and on laserdisc in 1984; a video re-issue from Virgin Vision followed in June 1989. It was released on Blu-ray on November 18, 2014, by Olive Films, under license from Paramount Pictures.

===Restoration and re-release===
A restored version of the film was released in 2011. The film was restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive (in cooperation with Sandcastle 5 Productions) as &quot;the first fruit of a new, larger project ... to preserve Mr. Altman&#x27;s artistic legacy.&quot; The preservation was funded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and The Film Foundation.

The new print was made &quot;from the original Super-16mm color negative, a 35mm CRI, a 35mm print, and the original ½ inch analog discreet mono D-M-E track.&quot;

The restoration premiered at the UCLA Festival of Preservation on March 3, 2011 and was screened at other North American cities in 2011 including New York City, Chicago, and Vancouver.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on a limited basis in just two theaters on November 12, 1982, grossing $22,298 and placing 18th at the North American box office that weekend. By its fourth week, it made $177,500 after expanding to four venues; during its entire run, it grossed $840,958.

===Critical response===
On its original release, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Michael Blowen hailed &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; as &quot;[Altman&#x27;s] best film since &quot;Nashville&quot;&quot;. He added, &quot;[The director] is having fun again. He seems more comfortable in a desolate Woolworth&#x27;s than he did on the frozen tundra of &quot;Quintet&quot;. In contrast with &quot;A Wedding&quot;, in which Altman cynically patronized his characters, he seems to love these three women. And why not?&quot; The Associated Press&#x27; Bob Thomas said, &quot;The film is a heartening example of how good writing ..., gifted direction and solid acting can produce something worthwhile on a tiny (under $1 million) budget.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Vincent Canby gave &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; a mixed review. &quot;There are some interesting things about [the film],&quot; he observed, &quot;but they have less to do with anything on the screen than with the manner in which the film was produced and with Mr. Altman&#x27;s unflagging if misguided faith in the project.&quot; He complained that &quot;The actresses are not treated kindly, either by the material or by the camera,&quot; and noted that Sandy Dennis&#x27; character, Mona, received most of the close-ups. &quot;The only person in the film who comes off well,&quot; he said, &quot;is Miss [Sudie] Bond.&quot; &quot;New York&quot;″s David Denby wrote: &quot;Altman uses cinema to celebrate theater, and his technique is so fluidly self-assured that he almost makes you forget the rubbishy situations and lines created by playwright Ed Graczyk. Almost, but not quite.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote: &quot;This is not a great drama, but two things make the movie worth seeing: Altman&#x27;s visual inventiveness and the interesting performances given by everyone in the cast.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;only the Karen Black character develops any appealing substance, and Altman must share the credit for that with Black herself, who turns in the film&#x27;s best performance. Cher&#x27;s role is nothing more than a country-western sketch. Surprisingly, she isn&#x27;t bad, and I suspect that this explains the plaudits her performance has earned.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote in &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot;: &quot;When Robert Altman gives a project everything he&#x27;s got, his skills are such that he can make poetry out of fake poetry and magic out of fake magic. Moving in apparent freedom, the principal actresses ... go at their roles so creatively that they find some kind of acting truth in what they&#x27;re doing. They bring conviction to their looneytunes characters.&quot; Film critic Leonard Maltin gave &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; two and a half stars out of four in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, writing, &quot;Strong performances, and Altman&#x27;s lively approach to filming [Graczyk&#x27;s] Broadway play can&#x27;t completely hide the fact that this is second-rate material.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; stated &quot;[&quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;] descends from cynicism through gloom to hysteria and is never very revealing.&quot;

At the Chicago premiere of &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;, Altman spoke of its festival acclaim to his audience: &quot;I never have had a film of mine received as well as this film—I don&#x27;t understand it, but I like it!&quot; In a January 1983 interview with the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, he stated that &quot;The critical reaction doesn&#x27;t surprise me. Nothing surprises me any more. I take that back. One thing surprised me when I showed &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; at film festivals—no one walked out.&quot;

&quot;Jimmy Dean&quot; won the Best Film Award at the Chicago International Film Festival, as well as a Best Screenplay Award at the Belgium International Film Festival. Cher, who played Sissy in the film, received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture.

&quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; currently holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews.

==Themes and criticism==
&quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; has been noted to address the subject of feminism. In &quot;Robert Altman: Hollywood Survivor&quot;, Daniel O&#x27;Brien wrote that &quot;&quot;[Jimmy Dean]&quot; is in part an attempt to explore the way women are forced to suppress their emotions and personalities in order to be accepted by the male-dominated society around them&quot;. In his 1980 book &quot;A Cinema of Loneliness: Penn, Kubrick, Coppola, Scorsese, Altman&quot;, film historian and critic Robert P. Kolker noted that &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime&quot; dealt with the &quot;crisis of women confronting the oppression of patriarchy by dissolving them into neuroses. Unable to struggle, these figures first collapse within themselves and then extrapolate their delusions as protections against the world that surrounds them.&quot;

On the film&#x27;s sexuality issues, Robin Wood said: &quot;What is especially interesting about &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime&quot; is the connection it makes between the oppression of women and patriarchy&#x27;s dread of sexual deviation and gender ambiguity. Joe (the only male character to appear in the film, in flashback) is clearly (and sympathetically) presented as feminine (as opposed to the stereotypically effeminate), woman-identified, and gay; as Don Short has perceptively shown, the film implies that he has become a transsexual ... because his society had no place for a gay male.&quot;

In his 1985 book on Altman, Gerard Plecki wrote: &quot;The reference to the James Dean myth is a clue to Altman&#x27;s pervasive film message. Altman knows that James Dean had the kind of screen presence and magic that caused people to &#x27;give in&#x27; to cinema.&quot; He added that &quot;In each film [the director] strives to reinforce and respond to that essential need—to give in to cinema.&quot; Plecki observed that &quot;It is fascinating that, after &quot;The James Dean Story&quot;, Altman would select another project touching upon the life of [the late actor].&quot;

O&#x27;Brien criticized the character development of the supporting roles, while Plecki said that, compared to those in previous Altman films, none of the characters &quot;are immediately likable&quot;. &quot;The reasons for the limited appeal of the characters are quite complex,&quot; Plecki wrote. &quot;Most of the women&#x27;s problems are physical or sexual ones.&quot;

In &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;, Altman frequently uses mirrors as a device to seamlessly connect scenes between the present and the past. Reflections in mirrors are part of many of the film&#x27;s frame compositions. As noted by Daniel O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Robert Altman: Hollywood Survivor&quot;, they &quot;[become] a window into 1955, enabling the characters to gaze into the past&quot;.

<text>Paul Eugene Gillmor (February 1, 1939 – September 5, 2007) was an American politician of the Republican Party who served as the U.S. representative from the 5th congressional district of Ohio from 1989 until his death in 2007.

==Early life, career, and family==
Gillmor was born in Tiffin, Ohio and grew up in Old Fort; his father owned a trucking business in the area. His mother was Lucy Fry Gillmor. He attended Old Fort High School, graduating in 1957. In 1961 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio Wesleyan University. In 1964, he graduated with a law degree from the University of Michigan.

From 1965 to 1966, Gillmor was on active duty in the U.S. Air Force as a Judge Advocate, attaining the rank of captain. He then entered the practice of law.

Paul Gillmor married Brenda Lee Luckey. She died in a car accident in Fremont, Ohio in September 1972. They had two daughters, Linda and Julie, who were in the car at the time.

Gillmor married Karen Lako, who also served in the Ohio Senate, in 1983. They had three sons: Paul Michael and twins Adam and Connor.
==Political career==

===Ohio State Senate===
Gillmor was elected as an Ohio state senator in 1967, where he remained until being elected to Congress in 1988. For the last 10 years of his tenure, he was the leader of the Republicans in the chamber, serving as president of the state senate for three General Assemblies from 1981 to 1982 and from 1985 to 1988. He ran in the 1986 Republican primary for governor, but lost to former governor James A. Rhodes.

===U.S. Congress===

====Elections====
In 1988, Gillmor entered the Republican primary for the 5th District after 30-year incumbent Del Latta retired. Latta endorsed his son, Bob, as his successor; Gillmor defeated him by only 27 votes. He was then handily elected in November and was reelected nine times in this heavily Republican district, usually by margins of 2-to-1. He ran unopposed in 1992.

In 2002, Gillmor defeated Republican Rex Damschroder in the primary.

====Committees and positions====
Gillmor was the ranking Republican on the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee. He also served on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and chaired its Environment and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee until the Republicans lost control of Congress following the 2006 elections. In 2006, Gillmor served as a member of a bipartisan reform task force on ethics and congressional mailing practices. He was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.

The American Conservative Union gave Gillmor&#x27;s 2005 voting record a rating of 82 points out of a possible 100; the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 0 rating.

Gillmor joined with Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank to propose the Industrial Bank Holding Company Act of 2006, which was designed to prevent retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot from operating banks to process their credit card transactions.

==Banking interests==
Gillmor became partial owner of Old Fort Bank in Seneca County, about southeast of Toledo, after the death of his father, Paul M. Gillmor.

In 2007, Gillmor received approval from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the offices of two federal regulators to be an initial director and investor in a new Florida bank, the Panther Community Bank.

==Death==
On September 5, 2007, Gillmor was found dead in his Arlington County, Virginia, townhouse by members of his staff after he failed to show up for a House Financial Services Committee meeting, and did not respond to repeated telephone calls and e-mails. While it was initially believed that he died from a heart attack, the Virginia state medical examiner&#x27;s office announced that Gillmor died from blunt head and neck trauma consistent with a fall down the stairs. Police assessed the scene and ruled out foul play. Gillmor&#x27;s death was ruled an accident.

In a special election held in December, Bob Latta, the man Gillmor had narrowly defeated in the 1988 primary, won the seat.

<doc id="766848" wikidata="Q1701309" url="?curid=766848" title="John Wilson (Irish politician)">

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1973 to 1992.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in 1923 at Callanagh, Kilcogy, County Cavan, the son of John Wilson, a farmer, and his wife Brigid (née Comaskey). He was educated at St. Mel&#x27;s College in Longford, the University of London and the National University of Ireland. In 1942 he entered Maynooth College to train for the catholic priesthood, but left after four years as a seminarian. He graduated with a Master of Arts in Classics and a Higher Diploma in Education. He was a secondary school teacher at St Eunan&#x27;s College in Letterkenny and Gonzaga College and also a university lecturer at University College Dublin (UCD), before he became involved in politics.

Wilson was also a Gaelic footballer for the Cavan county team, with which he won two All-Ireland medals; one in 1947 in the Polo Grounds, New York. He was a member of the teachers trade union, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI), and served as president of the association. While at St Eunan&#x27;s College in Letterkenny (at which time he lived at 3 College Row, close to the school gates, and taught within them between 1952 and 1960),

Wilson was known as &quot;Big Johnny&quot;, training the team that would reach the final of the 1961 MacRory Cup (though he departed for a teaching post at Gonzaga College midway through the year).

==Political career==
Wilson was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1973 general election for the Cavan constituency, for Cavan–Monaghan in 1977 and at each subsequent election until his retirement after the dissolution of the 26th Dail in 1992. He was succeeded as Fianna Fáil TD for Cavan-Monaghan by his special advisor, Brendan Smith, who went on to serve as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 2008 to 2011. In 1977, Taoiseach Jack Lynch appointed Wilson to the cabinet as Minister for Education. He went on to serve in each Fianna Fáil government until his retirement, serving in the governments of Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey and Albert Reynolds.

In 1990, Wilson challenged Brian Lenihan for the Fianna Fáil nomination for the 1990 presidential election. Lenihan won the nomination but failed to be elected President and was also sacked by the government. Wilson was then appointed Tánaiste. He remained in the cabinet until his retirement in 1993. Although the 26th Dail was dissolved in December 1992, Wilson served in Government until the new government took office.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement from politics, Wilson was appointed the Commissioner of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&#x27; Remains by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. This position entailed involvement with members of the Provisional IRA to assist in finding the bodies of the disappeared who were murdered by the Provisional IRA during The Troubles.

Wilson died in Beaumont, Dublin, on 9 July 2007.

<text>Chad Edward Moeller [MOE-ler] (born February 18, 1975) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2000 through 2010 for the Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and Baltimore Orioles.

==Amateur career==
Moeller attended Upland High School in California, where he lettered in football and baseball. He was teammates with future MLB players Geoff Jenkins, Jacque Jones, Morgan Ensberg and Randy Flores. The New York Yankees drafted Moeller in the 1993 MLB Draft, but he did not sign.

He attended the University of Southern California (USC) and played college baseball for the USC Trojans baseball team. In 1995, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. In 1996, he was an All-Pac-10 Conference selection. He tore his ACL on a home plate collision to end his college career.

==Professional career==
===Minnesota Twins===
Despite the injury, Moeller was drafted in the seventh round (187th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft by the Minnesota Twins. During his time in the Twins organization, he competed for playing time with Matt LeCroy and A.J. Pierzynski. After LeCroy hit .170 in 48 games, Moeller was called up to the majors. He made his debut on June 20, 2000, and got his first hit two days later against the Texas Rangers. On July 29, Moeller hit his first homer, a tie-breaking, three-run inside-the-park home run against the New York Yankees. When Moeller hit .216 through 33 games, the Twins called up Pierzynski, who hit .303 the rest of the way.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On March 28, 2001, Moeller was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for infielder Hanley Frias. That year, he hit .232 in 25 games with the big league club. During the 2002 season, Moeller was called up on July 15 and primarily caught Randy Johnson. He was behind the plate for Johnson&#x27;s 15 strikeout performance against the Montreal Expos on July 31; 16 strikeout game against the Chicago Cubs on August 25; and 17 strikeout performance against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 14. On the last day of the season, he helped the Diamondbacks clinch home field advantage on the playoffs by homering twice and driving in six runs. Moeller started Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Johnson allowed five earned runs on 10 hits in six innings in what would become a 12–2 loss.

After catcher Damian Miller was traded before the 2003 season, Moeller split catching duties with Rod Barajas. He managed to hit .268 with seven home runs and 29 RBI that year, though Moeller lost favor in the organization and was rarely used in the last few weeks of the season.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 1, 2003, the Diamondbacks included Moeller in a nine-player deal. He, along with Chris Capuano, Craig Counsell, Lyle Overbay, Jorge De La Rosa, and Junior Spivey, were traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Shane Nance, Noochie Varner, and Richie Sexson.

On April 27, 2004, Moeller hit for the cycle against the Cincinnati Reds. He was the first Brewer to hit for the cycle at home, and the first since Paul Molitor did it on May 15, 1991. He became Ben Sheets&#x27; personal catcher that year and caught his 18 strikeout performance against the Atlanta Braves on May 16. After Moeller hit .208 in a career-high 101 games, the Brewers signed Damian Miller to be the starting catcher in 2005.

In January 2006, he was named to Team USA&#x27;s preliminary roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. However, he was later dropped from the final roster. He hit .184 in 29 games during the 2006 season and was designated for assignment on July 5. Moeller was then outrighted to Triple-A. On July 15, he caught a combined no-hitter with the Sounds&#x27; Carlos Villanueva, Mike Meyers, and Alec Zumwalt.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On November 27, 2006, Moeller signed a one-year deal with the Cincinnati Reds. He began the season as one of three catchers on the 25-man roster. However, he was designated for assignment on April 18, 2007. He hit .167 in 30 games over three stints with the Reds that season.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for cash considerations on August 11, 2007. Moeller spent time with the Las Vegas 51s in Triple-A before he was called up in September.

===Washington Nationals===
On November 27, 2007, Moeller signed a Minor League contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals. He was released on March 9, 2008.

===New York Yankees===
He signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees on the same day he left the Nationals. The Yankees purchased his contract on April 14 following injuries to Jorge Posada and José Molina. On April 25, he was designated for assignment because it had been thought that Posada would be able to play through his injury. Posada, however, was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 28, and the Yankees added Moeller back to the active roster upon clearing assignment waivers on April 30. He remained on the active roster following Posada&#x27;s return from the disabled list and appeared at first base and third base for the first time in his career.

Moeller was again designated for assignment on July 31 following the acquisition of Iván Rodríguez. He cleared waivers and returned to Triple-A Scranton. Moeller rejoined the Yankees on September 1, when the rosters expanded.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Moeller signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles on December 12, 2008. He was brought in to help mentor Matt Wieters during spring training. Moeller ultimately made the opening day roster as the backup catcher to Gregg Zaun. After batting .200 with a .259 on-base percentage in fifteen games, he was designated for assignment on May 29 when the Orioles promoted top catching prospect Matt Wieters from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Moeller cleared waivers five days later and was assigned to the Tides. Moeller was recalled to Baltimore on August 7 when the Orioles traded catcher Gregg Zaun to the Tampa Bay Rays.

Moeller was signed to a minor league contract which included an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles on December 4, 2009. He was granted his release on April 1 after not making the team.

===New York Yankees (second stint)===
On April 3, Moeller signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. On May 20, he was called up to the Major League roster to back up Francisco Cervelli after another injury to Posada. He played his first game of the season on May 29, starting against the Cleveland Indians. On June 21, Moeller was designated for assignment to clear room on the roster for outfielder Colin Curtis, returning to the Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees on June 26. He was called up again on September 1.

===Colorado Rockies===
On January 19, 2011, Moeller signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies. However, he was released on March 11.

==Personal life==
Chad lives happily in Arizona with his three children. Moeller is the cousin of MLB coach Chris Cron, who is the father of C. J. Cron, and Kevin Cron.

Moeller is now a youth baseball instructor and owns a batting cage facility in Scottsdale, Arizona. He is also the owner and operator of Team Dinger, which fields several youth baseball teams in Arizona. In 2016, he worked with Tim Tebow to help the former quarterback prepare for a career as a baseball player.

<doc id="766855" wikidata="Q167800" url="?curid=766855" title="Zakho">
<text>Zakho, also spelled Zaxo (, , , , ) is a city in the Kurdistan Region, at the centre of the Zakho District of the Dohuk Governorate, located a few kilometers from the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing. Zakho is known for its celebrations of Newroz.

The population of the town rose from about 30,000 in 1950 to 350,000 in 1992 due to Kurds fleeing from other areas of the country.

The original settlement may have been on a small island in the Little Khabur river, which flows west through the modern city to form the border between Iraq and Turkey, continuing into the Tigris. Other important rivers in the area are the Zeriza and the Seerkotik.

==History==

Gertrude Bell, the renowned British archaeologist and Arabist who advised British governors in the region in the closing years of the British Mandate, was convinced that Zakho was the same place as the ancient town of Hasaniyeh. She also reported that one of the first Christian missionaries to the region, the Dominican friar Poldo Soldini, was buried there in 1779. His grave was still a pilgrimage destination in the 1950s.

The town is also the site of Zakho castle, of which today only the tower remains, and of Qubad Pasha castle, a hexagonal structure in Zakho cemetery.

According to an oral tradition transmitted by a Jewish informant from Zakho, Me&#x27;allim Levi, Zakho was established in 1568 by Slivani tribesmen, whose territory was stretched south of the location of the town. The family of Shamdin Agha came originally from the Slivani tribe, settled in Zakho, and became the most prominent family in Zakho. From the late 19th century onwards, the family of Shamdin Agha ruled &quot;all the Muslims, Jews and Christians of Zakho and its surroundings.&quot; Zakho was known to the ancient Greeks. In 1844, the traveller William Francis Ainsworth commented: &quot;The appearance of Zakho in the present day coincides in a remarkable manner with what it was described to be in the time of Xenophon.&quot;

Zakho is a major marketplace with its goods and merchandise serving the Kurdish-controlled area and most of north and central Iraq. Writing in 1818, Campanile described the town as a great trading centre, famous for its gallnuts as well as rice, oil, sesame, wax, lentils and many fruits.

=== Recent history ===

Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey. Trade with Turkey is now the major element of the economy. Oil drilling began in 2005.

====Islamic history====
In Islamic history it is perhaps best remembered as the location of the Battle of the Zab between the Umayyads and the Abbasids.

The river forms the approximate political boundary of Kurdistan Regional Government area of Iraq today. Its sister, the Little (or Lower) Zab rises in north-western part of Kurdistan province Iran, in the north of Piranshahr city and flows south-west through Iraq to join the Tigris north of the town of Baiji. The Dukan Dam straddles the Little Zab some 150 miles upstream from its confluence with the Tigris River. Constructed between 1954 and 1959, the dam has a total discharge capability of 4,300 cms. The power station, constructed in 1979, holds five water turbines and provides 400 MW of electrical energy.

In 1991, Zakho was the centre of the haven established by the British and the Americans in Operation Provide Comfort to protect the Iraqi Kurds from being massacred by Saddam Hussein when he responded brutally to the Kurdish rebellion. Most of the inhabitants of the city had fled to the mountains. When the American forces arrived, they described the town as a ghost city.

The 27 February 1995 Zakho bombing killed over 50 people. When the U.S. Army closed its military base in Zakho in 1996, they evacuated several thousand Kurds who had connections to the base and who feared reprisals. Many of them were given asylum in the USA. According to David McDowall, this constituted a sudden brain drain, with Zakho losing many of its most educated citizens.

In 2008 it was reported that the Turkish Army maintained four bases in Zakho District, under an agreement concluded with the Iraqi Government in the 1990s.

The 2011 Dohuk riots, which targeted Assyrian-owned businesses, were sparked by Kurdish Muslim clerics in the town.

====Christianity====
The city was the center of a large Chaldean Catholic diocese up until the middle of the nineteenth century, when it was divided into three dioceses: Amadia, Zakho, and Akra-Zehbar. The Armenians of Zakho established their community after the Armenian genocide, with the first Armenian church in the city being established in 1923.

====Judaism====

Zakho was formerly known for its synagogues and a large, ancient Jewish community. In the middle of the 19th century, Zakho became the chief spiritual center for the Jews of Kurdistan, and many sources refer to it as yerušalayim de-kurdistan &#x27;the Jerusalem of Kurdistan.&#x27;

The banks of the nearby Khabur River are mentioned in the Bible as one of the places to which the Israelites were exiled (1 Chronicles, 5:26, 2 Kings 17:6, 2 Kings 18:11).

The Jews spoke the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho and were also fluent in Kurmanji, the language spoken by non-Jewish Kurds.

Kurdish society was primarily a tribal one. The Jews of Zakho bore arms like Kurdish Muslims. There was an attack on the Jews in 1891, when one of the synagogues was burnt down. The troubles intensified in 1892.

Most of the Jews relocated to Israel in the 1950s. While the Jews of Zakho were among the least literate in the diaspora, they had a unique and rich oral tradition, known for its legends, epics and ballads, whose heroes came from both Jewish and Muslim traditions.

==Climate==
Zakho has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with very hot, dry summers, and cool wet winters.

==Landmarks==

One of Zakho&#x27;s famous landmarks is the Delal Bridge, made of stone.

Zakho Castle lies in the city centre on the western bank of the Khabur. It served as the governor&#x27;s house in the reign of the Badinan Emirate and was enlarged by Prince Ali Khan. It was built on the ruins of an older castle. Today, only the castle&#x27;s tower remains.

The Qubad Pasha Castle, in Zakho&#x27;s cemetery, is hexagonal, with six windows and an entrance gate.

== Population displacements ==
In 2007, the UNHCR reported that there were still 10,000 internally displaced persons in the Zakho district as a result of the Iraq War.

== Sports ==
Zakho Football Club (Zakho FC) was founded in 1987. The sports club plays in the Iraqi Premier League, where only the top 16 Iraqi football clubs play. Zakho FC has its own stadium with a capacity of 20,000 seats.

Zakho Basketball Club (Zakho SC) won the Kurdistan Basketball Super Cup and beat Duhok SC in Erbil.

<text>Theodore Strickland (born August 4, 1941) is an American politician who served as the 68th governor of Ohio from 2007 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives, representing (1993–1995, 1997–2007).

In the 2006 gubernatorial election, Strickland was elected to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Bob Taft, receiving 60% of the vote and defeating Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell. He was narrowly defeated for re-election in the 2010 gubernatorial election by former U.S. Representative John Kasich.

In April 2014, Strickland became president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization. Strickland left that position in February 2015, and subsequently announced his intention to run for the United States Senate against incumbent Rob Portman. He went on to lose by 20 points. As of 2025, Ted Strickland is the last Democrat to serve as governor of Ohio.

==Early life==
Strickland was born in Lucasville, Ohio, the son of Carrie (Carver) and Charles Orville Strickland. He was one of nine children. A 1959 graduate of Northwest High School, Strickland went on to be the first member of his family to attend college. Strickland received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with a minor in psychology from Asbury College in 1963. In 1966, he received a Master of Arts degree in guidance counseling from the University of Kentucky and a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) from the Asbury Theological Seminary in 1967. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to earn his Ph.D. in counseling psychology in 1980. He is married to Frances Strickland, an educational psychologist.

Strickland worked as a counseling psychologist at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. He was an administrator at a Methodist children&#x27;s home and was a professor of psychology at Shawnee State University. Strickland is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church. He was a minister at a Methodist church in Portsmouth, Ohio.

==Election to Congress==
Strickland ran for U.S. representative for Ohio&#x27;s 6th congressional district in 1976, 1978, and 1980, losing twice to long-time incumbent William H. Harsha and later to Harsha&#x27;s successor and campaign manager, Bob McEwen.

Strickland ran again for the 6th District seat in 1992, once again facing Bob McEwen, who had suffered some political damage by being associated with the House banking scandal. The 6th District had been combined with the old 10th District when Ohio lost two seats in Congress following the 1990 census and now covered a huge area stretching from Lebanon, in Warren County, to Marietta, in Washington County on the opposite side of the state. The district proved a difficult place to campaign, representing half a dozen different media markets and home to no large cities and few unifying influences.

Patrick J. Buchanan, Vice President Dan Quayle, and Oliver North came to Ohio to campaign for McEwen, but Strickland narrowly won in the general election on November 3, 1992. He received 122,720 votes to McEwen&#x27;s 119,252, a plurality of 3,468 – just over 1.4%. Strickland began serving in January 1993 in the 103rd Congress.

==Congressional career==
Strickland was among the many Democrats who lost their offices in the Republican surge of 1994, narrowly losing to businessman Frank Cremeans. Strickland reclaimed his seat two years later in a similarly narrow victory, and took office in January 1997 with the 105th Congress. He faced a strong challenge from Lieutenant Governor Nancy Hollister in 1998, but turned it back; in the next three elections he was reelected by large margins, running unopposed in 2004. Strickland served on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee.

==2006 gubernatorial campaign==
Strickland successfully ran for Governor of Ohio in 2006, when Governor Bob Taft was term-limited and could not run for re-election. Strickland selected former Ohio Attorney General and 1998 Democratic nominee for governor Lee Fisher as his running mate. He was sworn in as governor on January 8, 2007.

Strickland won the Democratic primary on May 2, 2006, with 80 percent of the vote.

Strickland&#x27;s endorsements included the Fraternal Order of Police and the Ohio Federation of Teachers.

In September 2006, a group called Republicans for Strickland publicly announced their support for Strickland at a press conference.

In the November general election, he was challenged by Republican Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, Libertarian economist Bill Peirce and Green Party candidate Bob Fitrakis. He won the general election on November 7, 2006, capturing 60.5% of the vote. Blackwell finished in second with 36.6% of the vote.

==Governorship==

===Economy===
In June 2007, Ohio lawmakers approved a $52 billion budget for fiscal year 2008–2009. In January 2008, facing a revenue shortfall, Strickland ordered a $733 million reduction in state spending, including job cuts and the closure of state mental hospitals. Strickland cut another $540 million from the budget in September 2008. In December 2008, Strickland announced a $640 million budget gap. In 2009, Strickland signed legislation which postponed the last of five scheduled income tax rate reductions from 2009 until 2011. The move used $844 million in anticipated tax refunds to fill the gap in the state budget.

In 2008, he signed the state&#x27;s renewable portfolio standard, mandating that 25% of the state&#x27;s electricity be produced by renewables by 2025. That same year, Strickland signed an executive order overhauling business regulations. In 2010, Strickland supported the renewal of the Third Frontier program in 2010.

During Strickland&#x27;s tenure, the state&#x27;s rainy day fund was reduced from $1 billion to 89 cents in order to balance the state budget. Some estimates claim Ohio would have experienced a $7 billion deficit if Strickland had not made such moves and cuts to the Ohio budget.

===Education===
Strickland signed an executive order in 2007 that unified the state&#x27;s higher education system by creating the University System of Ohio.

Strickland pushed to cut funding of school vouchers, which critics said would reduce educational choice available to the public. He opposed federally subsidized abstinence-only sex education programs.

===Veterans&#x27; affairs===

In 2007, Strickland signed legislation exempting military veterans&#x27; retirement benefits from state taxation. He signed an executive order creating a council to oversee the eventual establishment of the Ohio Department of Veterans Services as a cabinet-level agency. In 2008, he signed an executive order creating the Ohio G.I. Promise, which charges in-state tuition to all veterans attending the state&#x27;s public colleges on the G.I. bill. In 2008, he vetoed legislation which would have given small cash bonuses to veterans of wars in the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan from the state&#x27;s rainy day fund.

===Healthcare===
Strickland signed an executive order requiring insurance companies to offer policyholders the option to add or keep unmarried children on their insurance policies up to age 28.

===Social issues===
On the issue of capital punishment, Strickland delayed three executions until further review and commuted five death sentences. Strickland chose not to commute three additional executions, including two that eventually occurred. The March 20, 2007 execution of Kenneth Biros, which Strickland did not commute, was later stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. Biros was eventually executed in December 2009.

Strickland signed Ohio&#x27;s castle doctrine legislation in 2008, which established a presumption that a person acts in self-defense when shooting someone who unlawfully enters his or her home or occupied vehicle. The legislation was supported by the National Rifle Association.

Strickland held office when a constitutional amendment passed allowing casinos to be built in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Toledo and Columbus. Although originally opposed to the idea of allowing such types of gambling into the state, potential revenue shortfalls caused him to consider the option. More so, the implementation of video lottery terminals at Ohio racetracks also was considered as a revenue source, and Strickland said for about a year that he would ask the courts to weigh in on whether the executive branch has the authority to implement slots through the Ohio Lottery Commission.

As governor in 2010, Strickland opposed legislation allowing the medical use of cannabis. After leaving office he reversed his stance on the issue, however, and later in 2015 stated his support for legalizing recreational use.

===Theft of Ohio government computer backup tape===
The theft of an Ohio government computer backup tape in June 2007 was widely reported in the media after authorities revealed that the tape contained names and Social Security numbers of 64,000 state employees, 84,000 welfare recipients, and tens of thousands of others. In the wake of the theft, Strickland issued an executive order to change the practices for handling state data.

===Database searches of Joe the Plumber===
Strickland&#x27;s Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS), Helen Jones-Kelley, was involved in the controversial Ohio database searches of Joe Wurzelbacher during the final weeks of the 2008 presidential campaign. She bore ultimate responsibility for the unauthorized background checks run on Wurzelbacher, an Ohio Republican known as Joe the Plumber. Jones-Kelley was suspended without pay by Strickland and investigated by the Ohio Attorney General. She resigned in December, and Strickland appointed Douglas E. Lumpkin to replace her.

==Vice-presidential speculation==
Strickland was mentioned as a possible Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in 2008. He denied that he would accept a position on the ticket if offered.

Strickland spoke on the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Journalists Peggy Noonan and David Remnick credited Strickland with delivering the best line of the convention: &quot;You know, it was once said of the first George Bush that he was born on third base and thought he&#x27;d hit a triple. Well, with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus Bill Clinton left behind, George W. Bush came into office on third base and then he stole second. And John McCain cheered him every step of the way.&quot;

==2010 gubernatorial campaign==

Strickland sought re-election as governor in 2010. On January 19, 2010, he chose Yvette McGee Brown, a former juvenile court judge from central Ohio, as his running mate. Strickland faced Republican John Kasich and his running mate, Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor, in the general election. Kasich defeated Strickland by two percentage points.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
In March 2011, Kasich signed Senate Bill 5, which was intended to curtail the collective bargaining rights of Ohio public employees. Strickland was involved in gathering the petition signatures necessary to warrant a public referendum. With over two million signatures, the petition put the Ohio Collective Bargaining Limit Repeal on the November 2011 ballot, where it passed with more than 60% of the vote.

Strickland became a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics in spring 2012. Strickland spoke on the first night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention in a speech against the policies of Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

President Obama nominated Strickland to be one of the alternate representatives to the United Nations in September 2013, but his confirmation was delayed through the end of the year by Republican opposition in the Senate.

In April 2014, Strickland became president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization. Strickland left that position in February 2015.

In September 2024, Strickland was one of several former governors to sign an open letter to all 50 current governors urging them to certify their states’ votes after the upcoming November election.

==2012 DNC controversy==
At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where Antonio Villaraigosa was Chairman, the original 2012 party platform caused controversy after it was written, because the lack of typical invocations and references to God and God-given rights as well as lack of language affirming the role of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Both of these matters had been included in some previous platforms. On the second day, September 5, Strickland introduced an amendment on the floor of the convention to reinsert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. Convention Chairman Villaraigosa put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote was indecisive, Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with an equal volume of &quot;ayes&quot; and &quot;nos&quot;. A woman standing to his left said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to rule, and then you&#x27;ve got to let them do what they&#x27;re gonna do.&quot; Villaraigosa called a third vote with the same result. Villaraigosa then declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.

==Political stances==

===Climate change===
As Governor of Ohio, Ted Strickland worked to pass renewable energy legislation he says &quot;helped address the issue of climate change.&quot; In 2013, he said &quot;the debate on whether climate change exists is over. … The debate now must be focused on how climate change is affecting our communities.&quot; In 2015, he said &quot;I believe climate change is a problem; we&#x27;ve got to transition.&quot;

==2016 U.S. Senate election==

On February 25, 2015, Strickland announced his intention to run for the United States Senate against incumbent Republican Rob Portman. On March 31, 2015, former President Bill Clinton endorsed Strickland. In September 2016, Strickland&#x27;s campaign was reported to be increasingly faltering. With poor poll results against Portman, at least two major political action committees withdrew millions of dollars in funding for advertising for Strickland, choosing instead to focus on other major Senate races in which advertising was considered more likely to make a difference.

Strickland lost the 2016 general election by a large margin to Portman, 58%–37%.

<text>Electra, also Elektra or The Electra (, &quot;Ēlektra&quot;), is a Greek tragedy by Sophocles. Its date is not known, but various stylistic similarities with the &quot;Philoctetes&quot; (409 BC) and the &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; (406 BC) lead scholars to suppose that it was written towards the end of Sophocles&#x27; career. Jebb dates it between 420 BC and 414 BC.

==Storyline==
Set in the city of Mycenae a few years after the Trojan War, the play tells of a bitter struggle for justice by Electra and her brother Orestes for the murder of their father Agamemnon by Clytemnestra and their stepfather Aegisthus.

When King Agamemnon returns from the Trojan War, his wife Clytemnestra (who has taken Agamemnon&#x27;s cousin Aegisthus as a lover) kills him. Clytemnestra believes the murder was justified since Agamemnon had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia before the war, as commanded by the gods. Electra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, rescued her younger brother Orestes from her mother by sending him to Strophius of Phocis. The play begins years later when Orestes has returned as a grown man with a plot for revenge, as well as to claim the throne.

Orestes arrives with his friend Pylades, son of Strophius, and a pedagogue, i.e. tutor (an old attendant of Orestes, who took him from Electra to Strophius). They plan to have the tutor announce that Orestes has died in a chariot race and that two men (really Orestes and Pylades) are arriving shortly to deliver an urn with his remains. Meanwhile, Electra continues to mourn the death of her father Agamemnon, holding her mother Clytemnestra responsible for his murder. When Electra is told of the death of Orestes her grief is doubled, but this grief is to be short-lived.

After a choral ode, Orestes arrives carrying the urn supposedly containing his ashes. He does not recognize Electra, nor does she recognize him. He gives her the urn and she delivers a moving lament over it, unaware that her brother is, in fact, standing alive next to her. Now realizing the truth, Orestes reveals his identity to his emotional sister. She is overjoyed that he is alive, but in their excitement, they nearly reveal his identity, and the tutor comes out from the palace to urge them on. Orestes and Pylades enter the house and slay Clytemnestra. As Aegisthus returns home, they quickly put her corpse under a sheet and present it to him as the body of Orestes. He lifts the veil to discover who it really is, and Orestes then reveals himself. They escort Aegisthus offset to be killed at the hearth, the same location where Agamemnon was slain. The play ends here before the death of Aegisthus is announced.

==Similar works==

The story of Orestes&#x27; revenge was a popular subject in Greek tragedies.
*There are surviving versions by all three of the great Athenian tragedians: 
**&quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (458 BC), in the Oresteia Trilogy by Aeschylus
**&quot;Electra&quot; (Euripides play), a play by Euripides, probably in the mid 410s BC, likely before 413 BC, that tells a very different version of this same basic story from Sophocles. 
**&quot;Electra&quot; (Sophocles play)
* The story was also told at the end of the lost epic &quot;Nostoi&quot; (also known as &quot;Returns&quot; or &quot;Returns of the Greeks&quot;)
* The events are also brought up in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;

==Reception==
Roman writer Cicero considered &quot;Electra&quot; to be a masterpiece, and the work is also viewed favorably among modern critics and scholars. In &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Encyclopedia of World Drama&quot;, John Gassner and Edward Quinn argued that its &quot;simple device of delaying the recognition between brother and sister produces a series of brilliant scenes which display Electra&#x27;s heroic resolution under constant attack.&quot; Of the titular character, Edith Hall also wrote, &quot;Sophocles certainly found an effective dramatic vehicle in this remarkable figure, driven by deprivation and cruelty into near-psychotic extremes of behavior; no other character in his extant dramas dominates the stage to such an extent.&quot; L.A. Post noted that the play was &quot;unique among Greek tragedies for its emphasis on action.&quot;

<text>Denizli is a city in Aegean Turkey, and seat of the province of Denizli. The city forms the urban part of the districts Merkezefendi and Pamukkale, with a population of 651,200 in 2022.

Denizli has seen economic development in the last few decades, mostly due to textile production and exports.

Denizli also attracts visitors to the nearby mineral-coated hillside hot spring of Pamukkale, and with red color thermal water spa hotels Karahayıt, just north of Pamukkale. Recently, Denizli became a major domestic tourism destination due to the various types of thermal waters in Sarayköy, Central/Denizli (where Karahayıt and Pamukkale towns are located), Akköy (Gölemezli), Buldan (Yenicekent), and Çardak districts.

The ancient ruined city of Hierapolis, as well as ruins of the city of Laodicea on the Lycus, the ancient metropolis of Phrygia, are nearby. Also in the vicinity of Honaz, about west of Denizli is, what was, in the 1st century AD, the city of Colossae.

The weather is hot in Denizli in summers, whereas in winters, it may occasionally be very cold with snow on the mountains that surround the city. Some years, snow can be observed in the urban areas. Springs and autumns are rainy, with a mild warm climate.

==Name==
The word &quot;&quot; means &#x27;sea, large lake&#x27;. No sea or lake can be found near Denizli. However, the original Turkish name for the place was &quot;Tonguzlu&quot;, pronounced as &quot;toŋuzlu&quot; or &quot;doŋuzlu&quot;, later &quot;donuzlu&quot; (from &quot;&quot; &#x27;wild boar&#x27;). Thus Tonguzlu means a &#x27;place where boars dwell&#x27;. Because of the phonetical process (t-&gt;d, ŋ-&gt;n), the name was changed into &quot;denizlü&quot; or &quot;denizli&quot;, similar in pronunciation but different in meaning, in order to avoid the connotation &#x27;boar, pig&#x27;, which is considered offensive in Islam. Ibn Battuta recorded that the city was called &quot;Dun Ghuzluh&quot;. The latter is said to mean &#x27;the town of the swine&#x27;.

==History==
In antiquity, it was an important Greek town, called Attouda (Αττούδα), that existed through the ancient Greek and Roman eras; it was near the cities (Hierapolis and Laodicea on the Lycus) and flourished through the Byzantine period.

The city was conquered by the Seljuk Turks. Inhabitants of Laodicea were also resettled here in the Seljuk period.

Ibn Battuta visited the city, noting that &quot;In it there are seven mosques for the observance of Friday prayers, and it has splendid gardens, perennial streams, and gushing springs. Most of the artisans there are Greek women, for in it are many Greeks who are subject to the Turks and who pay dues to the sultan, including the &quot;jizya&quot;, and other taxes.&quot;

In the 17th century, the Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi visited Denizli and recorded the town as follows: &quot;The city is called by Turks as (Denizli) (which means &quot;has abundant of water sources like sea&quot; in Turkish) as there are several rivers and lakes around it. In fact it is a four-day trip from the sea. Its fortress is of square shape built on flat ground. It has no ditches. Its periphery is 470 steps long. It has four gates. These are: painters gate in North, saddle-makers gate in the East, new Mosque gate in the South, and vineyard gate in the West. There are some fifty armed watchmen in the fortress, and they attend the shop. The main city is outside the fortress with 44 districts and 3600 houses. There are 57 small and large mosques and district mosques, 7 madrasahs, 7 children&#x27;s schools, 6 baths and 17 dervish lodges. As everybody lives in vineyards the upper classes and ordinary people do not flee from each other.&quot;

The city lived in peace for centuries without being involved in wars in a direct manner. Following World War I, during the Turkish War of Independence, the Greek Army managed to capture and come as close as Sarayköy, a small town northwest of Denizli, but did not venture into Denizli. They were then ousted from the region by Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The most widespread symbols of Denizli province are of textile industry.

==Climate==
Denizli has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot; or Trewartha: &quot;Cs&quot;), with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, rainy winters. The inland areas, like Çardak, Bozkurt, Çivril, and Çal districts/counties of the province are cooler and have a higher elevation than the seaside, western part of the Province. Therefore, there are climatic differences within the province and even in the Denizli urbanized area. The land is open to winds coming from the Aegean Sea as the mountains are perpendicular to the coastline.

Highest recorded temperature: on 15 August 2007&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 9 February 1965

==Denizli today==
===Economy===

During World War I, Denizli mined chromium.

===Transportation===
Denizli Çardak Airport is about 45 minutes drive from the city center.

The extension of İzmir-Aydın highway to Denizli has been announced for several years. Initial infrastructure was laid in Aydın, but the rest is still forthcoming. The present Aydın-Denizli road, has a very high level of traffic, especially trucks, with each town along the road possessing its own industrial zone.

===Places of interest===
* Laodicea ad Lycum - north of Denizli near the village of Eskihisar. The city was established by Seleucid King, Antiochus II in honor of his wife, Laodice. This trading city was famous for its woolen and cotton cloths. A letter written by a Laodecian says: &quot;I am happy. I have fortune and I am not in need of anything.&quot; Following a large earthquake which destroyed the city, what remains of the ancient city are one of the seven churches of Asia Minor, the stadium, the amphitheatre and the odeon, the cistern and the aqueduct. &quot;(see further Laodicean Church)&quot;
* Hierapolis and Pamukkale World Heritage Sites - north of Denizli Pamukkale travertines. The city of Hierapolis was founded by the Pergamon King Eumenes II in 190 BC. Its closeness to Laodicea led to commercial and military rivalry. The town was built in Greek style. Despite suffering a violent earthquake in 17 AD, it reached its peak during the Roman and Byzantine periods. It was reconstructed during the 2nd and 3rd centuries in stone from quarries in the area, in a Roman style. The town had its most glorious years during the reign of Roman Emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla and became an episcopal seat during the expansion of Christianity. However, as a result of several earthquakes, the most violent of which was in 1354, a great part of the town was destroyed, and its people migrated.
* The Seljuq caravanserai Akhan, which is from Denizli City on the Ankara highway, and a great part of which still remains, was constructed by Karasungur bin Abdullah in 1253-54 when he was acting as the commander of Ladik. It was recently restored along with the Ottoman konaks nearby and is set to become a visitor&#x27;s attraction by its own right.
* Honaz mountain is a popular picnic excursion for Denizli&#x27;s people in summer.
* The nearby village of &quot;Goncalı&quot;, which is on the railway line, is another excursion. People come to eat the charcoal-grilled thinly-cut kebab called &quot;çöp şiş&quot;, preferably with the local süzme yoghurt and a glass of rakı.
* There is a statue of Atatürk at Çınar Meydanı in the city centre.
* Servergazi türbesi is located near to the Yenişehir neighborhood. The tomb of the 12th century Turkish commander of the Seljuk akıncı unit is located there. Many locals visit and pray at the tomb especially on weekends.
* Teraspark Shopping and Lifestyle Center, Teraspark AVM, located in Yenişehir. Teraspark AVM is the biggest shopping center in Denizli.
* Forum Çamlık Shopping and Lifestyle Center, Forum Çamlık AVM, located in the heart of the city centre, Demokrasi Meydanı/Square and surrounded by residential areas, welcomes more than 450,000 people within a catchment area of 20 minutes. The design of Forum Çamlık was inspired by the rich architectural elements that are unique to Province of Denizli. Local stones like Denizli travertine and marble are used for the cladding of many buildings.

<text>Earl of Ypres was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was a victory title, referring to the Flemish city of Ypres, which gave its name the Salient of Ypres, site of extremely bloody fighting in World War I.

== History ==
It was created on 5 June 1922 for Field Marshal John French, 1st Viscount French. He was Chief of the Imperial General Staff from 1912 to 1914, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War from 1914 to 1915 and Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1919 to 1922. French had already been created Viscount French, of Ypres and of High Lake in the County of Roscommon (in Connacht, Ireland), on 1 January 1916. The viscountcy was also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
He was succeeded by his son John Richard Lowndes French, the second Earl, who was a Captain in the Royal Field Artillery, as well as a talented artist.
On his death, the titles passed to his son John Richard Charles Lambart French, the third Earl. He fought in the Second World War as a Captain in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. The family&#x27;s wealth had decreased; he was employed as a hall porter in a Chelsea mansion block, nevertheless maintaining &quot;a Monty Pythonesque sense of humour about his predicament&quot;. Lord Ypres had four daughters but no sons, so on his death in 1988 his titles became extinct. 

Other notable members of the family were the suffragette and writer Charlotte Despard, the elder sister of the first Earl, and Lady Lucy French, youngest daughter of the third Earl, who became a prominent journalist and has done extensive work for charity and fundraising for the arts, most notably for Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre.

== Earls of Ypres (1922–1988) ==
* John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852–1925)
* John Richard Lowndes French, 2nd Earl of Ypres (1881–1958)
* John Richard Charles Lambart French, 3rd Earl of Ypres (1921–1988)

<text>Bring It On is a 2000 American teen comedy film directed by Peyton Reed (in his theatrical film directing debut) and written by Jessica Bendinger. The film stars Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, and Gabrielle Union. The plot of the film centers around two high-school cheerleading teams&#x27; preparation for a national competition.

&quot;Bring It On&quot; was released in theaters in North America on August 25, 2000, and became a box office success. The film opened at the number 1 spot in North American theaters and remained in the position for two consecutive weeks, earning a worldwide gross of approximately $90 million. The film received generally positive reviews and has become a cult classic.

It was the first of the &quot;Bring It On&quot; film series and was followed by six direct-to-video sequels, none of which contains any of the original cast members: &quot;Bring It On Again&quot; (2004), which shared producers with the original, &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot; (2006), &quot;Bring It On: In It to Win It&quot; (2007), &quot;Bring It On: Fight to the Finish&quot; (2009), &quot;Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack&quot; (2017), and the TV film, &quot;Bring It On: Cheer or Die&quot; (2022).

==Plot==
Cheerleader Torrance Shipman is a senior at Rancho Carne High School in San Diego. Her boyfriend, Aaron, is at college at Cal State Dominguez Hills, and her cheerleading squad, the Toros, are aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected the next team captain, replacing her highly successful predecessor &quot;Big Red&quot; after she graduates. In her first practice as captain, one of her teammates, Carver, is injured and forced to sit the rest of the season out. Torrance holds auditions for a replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a skilled gymnast who transferred from Los Angeles with her brother, Cliff.

While watching the Toros practice, Missy accuses them of plagiarizing their cheers, which Torrance vehemently denies. Missy takes her to L.A. to watch the East Compton Clovers, a squad that Missy&#x27;s previous high school frequently competed against, who perform an identical routine. Isis, the Clovers’ captain, confronts the two and reveals that Big Red videotaped the Clovers&#x27; routines and stole them for the Toros. The Clovers vow to beat the Toros in the national competition, which they could not afford to attend in previous years, and prove that they are in fact the champions. Torrance worries that she is cursed with bad luck after she dropped the Spirit Stick, an object that is never supposed to touch the ground, during a dare at cheer camp over the summer. Meanwhile, Torrance and Cliff begin to get to know each other and a mutual attraction grows between them as Aaron becomes more distant.

After Torrance informs the Toros about the stolen routines, the team votes in favor of using the current routine to win. Torrance agrees, feeling there is no time to learn a new routine, while Missy reluctantly goes along with it. At the Toros&#x27; next home game, Isis and her teammates mock the Toros&#x27; routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. After advice from Aaron, Torrance recruits the team to raise money through a car wash and hire choreographer Sparky Polastri. Polastri puts the whole team on a diet and regularly belittles them, but the team learns the routine in time for competition. At Regionals, the team scheduled before the Toros performs the same routine Sparky taught them. With little choice, they perform that same routine next. Torrance speaks to a competition official and learns their choreographer has provided the routine for six other teams. As the defending champions, the Toros are granted their place in nationals in Daytona Beach, Florida, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Big Red chastises Torrance for her inability to be a leader, and says that if she made any mistake as a squad leader, it was not stealing cheers but rather announcing Torrance as her successor. Crushed by Big Red&#x27;s words and her failure to lead the squad successfully, Torrance considers quitting.

Aaron recommends that Torrance step down from her position as captain and considers selling her out to her team rivals Courtney and Whitney. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together kissing, he severs his friendship with her. Torrance breaks up with Aaron after confronting him about being distant and not believing in her, as well as catching him cheating. She uses Cliff&#x27;s previous encouragement and his personally-made mixtape for her as inspiration for the team to have a real original routine. When the Toros learn that the Clovers are unable to get the funds to pay for nationals, Torrance asks her father&#x27;s company to sponsor the team; Isis refuses, calling it &quot;guilt money&quot;. Instead, the Clovers write to a local talk show host from their neighborhood and get the funds needed to go to Florida. At nationals, both the Toros and the Clovers make it to the finals, with Cliff making a surprise appearance in the audience to cheer the team on. Torrance and Isis give each other last-minute advice. Ultimately, the Clovers come out victorious, with the Toros coming in second. Despite their loss, the Toros and Clovers leave with a newfound respect for each other, with Isis complimenting Torrance on leading the squad and Torrance admitting the Clovers were deserving of their victory. As the Toros celebrate another successful season, Cliff and Torrance share a kiss.

==Production==

=== Development ===
Jessica Bendinger, a former journalist and music video director, originally pitched the idea for the film, then titled &quot;Cheer Fever&quot;, as &quot;&quot;Clueless&quot; meets &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; set at the National High School Cheerleading Championships&quot;, saying she was obsessed with cheerleading competitions on ESPN. Bendinger said the idea combined her love for hip hop music and cheerleading.

The film&#x27;s depiction of cultural appropriation was informed by Bendinger&#x27;s experiences as a white writer covering hip hop artists at music magazine &quot;Spin&quot;, a predominantly white publication. Said Bendinger: &quot;Having seen white kids emulating hip hop moves at those [cheer] competitions, I thought, &#x27;Well, what if.&#x27; I started asking what if questions...until I got to, what if the best team in the country had been stealing their routines? What if that squad they&#x27;d been stealing from finally came to show up and compete for their crown?&quot;

Bendinger&#x27;s pitch was passed over 28 times before finding a home at Beacon Pictures.

Marc Abraham and Thomas Bliss came on board to produce the film, as well as director Peyton Reed who had previously helmed two made-for-television films for Walt Disney.

=== Casting ===
Prior to auditioning for the film, actors were expected to have a cheer prepared. To avoid the use of stunt doubles, Reed required all the actors to participate in a four-week cheerleading camp. Reed and Gabrielle Union met numerous times to discuss the best way to approach her character. &quot;I think she was able to find what was cool about that character, in a way, I doubt other actresses could. Whenever she&#x27;s on the screen she has this charisma,&quot; Reed said of Union.

James Franco and Jason Schwartzman both auditioned for the role of Cliff Pantone. Kirsten Dunst originally turned down the role of Torrance Shipman as she was not interested. Marley Shelton was the second choice for the role but she decided to star in the film &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; instead.

=== Filming ===
While editing the film, Reed and editor Larry Bock watched cheerleading exploitation films from the 1970s. The movie clip shown to the cheer team during the &#x27;types of dance inspiration&#x27; montage is from &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;.

Most of the scenes in the film were shot in different locations and high schools in San Diego County, California, as well as San Diego State University. Local high school cheer squads were used as extras. Filming took place from July 12 to September 10, 1999.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
&quot;Bring It On&quot; was released in North America on August 25, 2000. The film grossed $17,362,105 in 2,380 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first at the North American box office, beating &quot;The Cell&quot; and &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Although it experienced an 34% decline in gross earnings, the film held the top position for a second consecutive week. The film went on to gross $68,379,000 in North America and an additional $22,070,929 in other territories for a total gross of $90,449,929.

===Critical response===
The film received a 65% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Despite the formulaic fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

A. O. Scott from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commended the film for the ability to &quot;gesture toward serious matters of racial/economic inequality&quot;, as well as for its &quot;occasional snarl of genuine satire&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also favored the film, calling it a &quot;Smart and sassy high school movie fun for all ages.&quot; In addition, Thomas commended the film for how it &quot;subversively suggests that sometimes there are more important values in life than winning&quot;, as well as for its inclusion of a gay cheerleader character who is comfortable in his sexuality. Kim Morgan of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; dubbed the film the &quot;newest, and probably first, cheerleading movie.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also gave a positive review, praising the film&#x27;s &quot;tart, taut script by first-time screenwriter Jessica Bendinger&quot; as well as its depiction of teenagers.

However, some reviewers criticized the plot and tone of the film. Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; disliked how the film&#x27;s bowdlerizing of crude humor to avoid an R rating resulted in a tonally inconsistent film. Ebert opined, &quot;We get a strange mutant beast, half Nickelodeon movie, half R-rated comedy. It&#x27;s like kids with potty-mouth playing grownup&quot;, and awarded the film two out of four stars.

David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; praised the writing, though he also likened the storyline&#x27;s simplicity to &quot;the average football cheer&quot;. Vicky Edwards from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found the film &quot;Absurdly unrealistic at times.&quot; The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;″s Paula Nechak concluded the film was &quot;predictable and surprisingly confusing in its ultimate message.&quot;

Many critics praised Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her &quot;a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt.&quot; Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; notes &quot;among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst is the sunniest imaginable parodist.&quot; Jessica Winter from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; shared this sentiment, commenting &quot;[Dunst] provides the only major element of &quot;Bring It On&quot; that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness &quot;to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film ranked #30 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. Roger Ebert recanted his initial negative impression of the film, later referring to &quot;Bring It On&quot; as the &quot;&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of cheerleader movies.&quot;

==Legacy==
=== Cultural impact ===
In the years since its release, &quot;Bring It On&quot; has been lauded for being a rare teen film to address issues of systemic inequality, cultural appropriation, and intersectional feminism, which are seen as major factors for the film&#x27;s continued legacy.

Beatrice Hazlehurst of &quot;i-D&quot; wrote, &quot;While its racial inclusion — especially among primary characters — already put the film far ahead of its time, the dynamics of social strata woven throughout the tapestry of &quot;Bring It On&quot; allow it to hold up so well 20 years later. By wrapping its arms narratively around &#x27;not only people of color, but queer kids and kids who might feel othered,&#x27; Bendinger says &quot;Bring It On&quot; offered the overlooked and ostracized the chance to see themselves on screen.&quot;

This was echoed by actor Jesse Bradford: &quot;[The movie] managed to shine a light on problems like appropriation and white fragility... in light of recent history, &quot;Bring It On&quot; seems relevant right now.&quot;

===Sequels===
&quot;Bring It On&quot; is followed by five direct-to-video sequels &amp; one television film sequel:
* &quot;Bring It On Again&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Bring It On: In It to Win It&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Bring It On: Fight to the Finish&quot; (2009)
* &quot;Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack&quot; (2017)
* &quot;Bring It On: Cheer or Die&quot; (2022)

The only sequel to feature any of the original filmmaking crew from &quot;Bring It On&quot; was 2004&#x27;s &quot;Bring It On Again&quot;. The producers of the original film did not return for sequels after &quot;Bring It On Again&quot;, and none of the films share recurring cast members. Steve Rash directed two of the sequels and Alyson Fouse wrote four screenplays. Otherwise, none of the films in the &quot;Bring It On&quot; franchise share cast or crew.

The five released films following &quot;Bring It On&quot; share tenuous plot links. The plot of each film typically follows the first film—a competitive cheerleading team changes routines or other elements to win.

===Stage musical===

A stage version of the film premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on January 16, 2011. The musical has music by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt, lyrics by Amanda Green, and a book by Jeff Whitty. The director and choreographer is Andy Blankenbuehler. The cast includes Amanda LaVergne as Campbell, Adrienne Warren as Danielle, and Nick Blaemire as Randall, and &quot;award-winning competitive cheerleaders from across the country&quot;.

The Alliance Theatre production was nominated for eight Suzi Bass Awards, winning awards for Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler), Sound Design (Brian Ronan), and World Premiere Play or Musical. The production was nominated for ten Atlanta Theater Fan Awards from in 2011. The production won for Best Musical and Best Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler).

A national tour of the musical started at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in November–December 2011 and then traveled to San Francisco, Denver, Houston, and Toronto. The national tour stars Taylor Louderman as Campbell and Jason Gotay as Randall. The cast celebrated kicking-off the national tour of the musical on October 22, 2011, by performing skits from the show.

Charles Isherwood of &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote of the Ahmanson Theatre production: &quot;After an opening number truly-dazzles as it reveals the cast&#x27;s impressive gymnastic prowess, the score hits its stride after Campbell transfers to Jackson High. Surging R&amp;B grooves and churning lyrics suggest the fingerprints of Mr. Miranda ... the dance numbers for the Jackson crowd kick the musical into high-gear for most of the first act... Like most entertainments about the trials and triumphs of the teenage years, &#x27;Bring It On&#x27; has as much sap as it does pep in its DNA, distinguished primarily by the electrifying dance routines and the elaborate cheer-squad performances.&quot;

The musical opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre, in a limited run, starting on July 12, 2012, in previews, and officially on August 1 through December 30, 2012.

==Soundtrack==

Bring It On: Music from the Motion Picture was released by Epic Records on August 22, 2000. It features multiple tracks from Blaque, who play Clovers cheerleaders in the film. It also includes songs from Daphne &amp; Celeste, 3LW, and a cover of the Toni Basil song &quot;Mickey&quot; by B*Witched.

<text>Psychopathology is the study of mental illness. It includes the signs and symptoms of all mental disorders. The field includes abnormal cognition, maladaptive behavior, and experiences which differ according to social norms. This discipline is an in-depth look into symptoms, behaviors, causes, course, development, categorization, treatments, strategies, and more.

Biological psychopathology is the study of the biological etiology of abnormal cognitions, behaviour and experiences. Child psychopathology is a specialization applied to children and adolescents.

==History==
Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and superstition. Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The Greek physician Hippocrates was one of the first to reject the idea that mental disorders were caused by possession of demons or the devil, and instead looked to natural causes. He firmly believed the symptoms of mental disorders were due to diseases originating in the brain. Hippocrates suspected that these states of insanity were due to imbalances of fluids in the body. He identified these fluids to be four in particular: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. This later became the basis of the chemical imbalance theory used widely within the present.

Furthermore, not far from Hippocrates, the philosopher Plato would come to argue the mind, body, and spirit worked as a unit. Any imbalance brought to these compositions of the individual could bring distress or lack of harmony within the individual. This philosophical idea would remain in perspective until the seventeenth century. It was later challenged by Laing (1960) along with Laing and Esterson (1964) who noted that it was the family environment that led to the formation of adaptive strategies.

In the eighteenth century&#x27;s Romantic Movement, the idea that healthy parent-child relationships provided sanity became a prominent idea. Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau introduced the notion that trauma in childhood could have negative implications later in adulthood.

In the 1600s and 1700s insane asylums started to be opened to house those with mental disorders. Asylums were places where restraint techniques and treatments could be tested on patients who were confined. These were early precursors for psychiatric hospitals.
In 1875 the German book &quot;Textbook of Forensic Psychopathology&quot; was published, written by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, which became a standard psychiatric textbook for Universities across Germany.

The scientific discipline of psychopathology was founded by Karl Jaspers in 1913. It was referred to as &quot;static understanding&quot; and its purpose was to graphically recreate the &quot;mental phenomenon&quot; experienced by the client. A few years earlier, in 1899, the German book &quot;Lehrbuch der Psychopathologischen Untersuchungs-Methoden&quot; was published by Robert Sommer.

===Psychoanalysis===

Sigmund Freud proposed a method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Talking therapy would originate from his ideas on the individual&#x27;s experiences and the natural human efforts to make sense of the world and life.

==As the study of psychiatric disorders==

The study of psychopathology is interdisciplinary, with contributions coming from clinical psychology, abnormal psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology, as well as neuropsychology and other psychology subdisciplines. Other related fields include psychiatry, neuroscience, criminology, social work, sociology, epidemiology, and statistics.

Psychopathology can be broadly separated into descriptive and explanatory. Descriptive psychopathology involves categorising, defining and understanding symptoms as reported by people and observed through their behaviour which are then assessed according to a social norm. Explanatory psychopathology looks to find explanations for certain kinds of symptoms according to theoretical models such as psychodynamics, cognitive behavioural therapy or through understanding how they have been constructed by drawing upon Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2016) or Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Flowers &amp; Larkin, 2013).

There are several ways to characterise the presence of psychopathology in an individual as a whole. One strategy is to assess a person along four dimensions: deviance, distress, dysfunction, and danger, known collectively as the four Ds. Another conceptualisation, the p factor, sees psychopathology as a general, overarching construct that influences psychiatric symptoms.

== Mental Disorders ==
Mental disorders are defined by a set of characteristic features, that is more than just one symptom. In order to be classified for diagnosis, the symptoms cannot represent an expected response to a common stress or loss that is related to an event. Syndromes are a set of simultaneous symptoms that represent a disorder. Common mental health disorders include depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Depression is one of the most common and most debilitating mental disorders worldwide. It affects how individuals think, feel, and act. Symptoms vary depending on each individual person and include feeling sad, irritable, hopeless, or losing interest in activities once enjoyed.

Generalized anxiety disorder is feeling worried or nervous more frequently than what correlates to real-life stressors. It is more common in women than men and includes symptoms such as having trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness, or feeling restless and have trouble relaxing. 

== The Four Ds ==
A description of the four Ds when defining abnormality:

# &quot;Deviance&quot; is variation from statistical norms that result in a conflict with society. This term describes the idea that specific thoughts, behaviors and emotions are considered deviant when they are unacceptable or not common in society. Clinicians must, however, remember that minority groups are not always deemed deviant just because they may not have anything in common with other groups. Therefore, we define an individual&#x27;s actions as deviant or abnormal when their behaviour is deemed unacceptable by the culture they belong to. However, many disorders have a relation between patterns of deviance and therefore need to be evaluated in a differential diagnostic model.
# &quot;Distress&quot; has to do with the discomfort that is experienced by the person with the disorder. This term accounts for negative feelings by the individual with the disorder. They may feel deeply troubled and affected by their illness. Behaviors and feelings that cause distress to individuals or to others around them are considered abnormal if the condition is upsetting to the person experiencing it. Distress is related to dysfunction by being a useful asset in accurately perceiving dysfunction in an individual&#x27;s life. These two are not always related because an individual can be highly dysfunctional and at the same time experience minimal stress. The important characteristic of distress is not dysfunction; rather it is the upsetting events themselves and the way we respond to them.
# &quot;Dysfunction&quot; involves an inability to maladaptive behavior that impairs the individual&#x27;s ability to perform normal daily functions. It includes dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes that are associated with mental functioning. This maladaptive behavior has to be significant enough to be considered a diagnosis. It&#x27;s highly noted to look for dysfunction across an individual&#x27;s life experience because there is a chance the dysfunction may appear in clear observable view and in places where it is less likely to appear. Such maladaptive behaviours prevent the individual from living a normal, healthy lifestyle. However, dysfunctional behaviour is not always caused by a disorder; it may be voluntary, such as engaging in a hunger strike.
# &quot;Duration&quot; is useful for clinicians to use as a criterion for diagnosis. Most symptoms have a specific duration that they last before being diagnosed. Can be harmful as not every person&#x27;s experience is the same.

===The p factor===
Benjamin Lahey and colleagues first proposed a general &quot;psychopathology factor&quot; in 2012, or simply &quot;p factor&quot;. This construct shares its conceptual similarity with the g factor of general intelligence. Instead of conceptualising psychopathology as consisting of several discrete categories of mental disorders, the p factor is dimensional and influences whether psychiatric symptoms in general are present or absent. The symptoms that are present then combine to form several distinct diagnoses. The p factor is modelled in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology. Although researchers initially conceived a three-factor explanation for psychopathology generally, subsequent study provided more evidence for a single factor that is sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exists on a continuum of severity and chronicity.

Higher scores on the p factor dimension have been found to be correlated with higher levels of functional impairment, greater incidence of problems in developmental history, and more diminished early-life brain function. In addition, those with higher levels of the p factor are more likely to have inherited a genetic predisposition to mental illness. The existence of the p factor may explain why it has been &quot;... challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders.&quot;

A 2020 review of the p factor found that many studies support its validity and that it is generally stable throughout one&#x27;s life. A high p factor is associated with many adverse effects, including poor academic performance, impulsivity, criminality, suicidality, reduced foetal growth, lower executive functioning, and a greater number of psychiatric diagnoses. A partial genetic basis for the p factor has also been supported.

Alternatively, the p factor has also been interpreted as an index of general impairment rather than being a specific index that causes psychopathology.

==As mental symptoms==
The term psychopathology may also be used to denote behaviours or experiences which are indicative of mental illness, even if they do not constitute a formal diagnosis. For example, the presence of hallucinations may be considered as a psychopathological sign, even if there are not enough symptoms present to fulfil the criteria for one of the disorders listed in the DSM or ICD.

In a more general sense, any behaviour or experience which causes impairment, distress or disability, particularly if it is thought to arise from a functional breakdown in either the cognitive or neurocognitive systems in the brain, may be classified as psychopathology. It remains unclear how strong the distinction between maladaptive traits and mental disorders actually is, e.g. neuroticism is often described as the personal level of minor psychiatric symptoms.

== &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; ==
Main article: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) is a guideline for the diagnosis and understanding of mental disorders. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) sponsors the editing, writing, reviewing and publishing of this book. It is a reference book on mental health and brain-related conditions and disorders. It serves as reference for a range of professionals in medicine and mental health in the United States particularly. These professionals include psychologists, counsellors, physicians, social workers, psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners, marriage and family therapists, and more. The current DSM is the fifth, most recent edition of this book. It was released in May 2013. Each edition makes significant changes to the classification of disorders.

== &quot;Research Domain Criteria&quot; ==
Main article: Research Domain Criteria

The RDoC framework is a set of research principles for investigating mental disorders. It is meant to create a new approach to mental illness that leads to better diagnosis, prevention, intervention, and cures. It is not necessarily meant to serve as a diagnostic guide or replace the DSM, however, it is meant to examine various degrees of dysfunction. It was developed by the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). It aims to address heterogeneity by providing a more symptom based framework for understanding mental disorders. It relied on dimensions that span the range from normal to abnormal and allows investigators to work with a larger database. It uses six major functional domains to examine neurobehavioral functioning. Different aspects of each domain are represented by constructs which are studied along the full range of functioning. Together all of the domains form a matrix that could represent research ideas. It is a heuristic, and acknowledges that research topics will change and grow as science emerges.

<text>David Lee Hobson (October 17, 1936 – October 6, 2024) was an American lawyer and politician of the Republican Party who served as a U.S. representative from the seventh congressional district of Ohio from 1991 to 2009.

==Early life and education==
Hobson was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and graduated from Withrow High School in 1954. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio Wesleyan University (Delaware, Ohio) in 1958 and a law degree from Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio) in 1963. He served in the Ohio Air National Guard from 1958 to 1963, and was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame. Hobson served as an Ohio state senator from 1982 to 1990, serving as President of the Ohio Senate from 1988 to 1990 and as a majority whip. Hobson was responsible for Ohio&#x27;s first AIDS law and grants for treatments for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Congress==
In 1990, after Mike DeWine left his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to become Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, Hobson was elected to replace him. It was the second time Hobson had succeeded DeWine; he had followed DeWine into the Ohio Senate. Hobson began serving in the House in 1991 (102nd Congress), and was reelected eight times without serious difficulty. Hobson was the assistant majority whip for the 110th Congress. Hobson was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and was considered to be a moderate Republican.

As a congressman, some of Hobson&#x27;s primary concerns were improving health care, controlling government spending and balancing the budget, and strengthening national security. Hobson also believed that Congress needed to help stimulate the economies of former industrial towns which had seen factories leave. He sought to privatize military housing and fund military research at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which was in his district, and helped to establish the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery and Glenn Research Center. He also secured funding for a memorial at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial for American soldiers killed in World War II.

Hobson served in the House Committee on Appropriations, and became the top Republican on the Military Construction and Energy-Water subcommittees. He opposed several attempts by the administration of George W. Bush to fund a bunker buster.

=== Controversies ===
In October 2006, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Hobson led a delegation to Normandy, France in August 2004 for the groundbreaking of an &quot;interpretive center&quot; at a cemetery for American soldiers killed during World War II. During the seven-day trip, the delegation was feted with at least two private restaurant dinners, one given by Northrop Grumman and another by the PMA Group, a leading lobbyist for defense companies. On a 2005 trip to visit nuclear fuel processing plants in France, Hobson and his delegation attended a dinner near Avignon, in southern France, hosted by Areva SA, the world&#x27;s largest maker of nuclear reactors. Because House rules prohibit members from accepting any gifts worth $50 or more, the article cited the opinions of “experts” on congressional ethics who speculated that the trip may have violated House rules and possibly federal law. However, no legal or ethics charges were brought forward and no impropriety was alleged by either legal or congressional ethics officials.

On October 14, 2007, Hobson announced that he would retire at the end of his term in 2009. After leaving Congress, he became president of the lobbying firm Vorys Advisors LLC. 

===Committee assignments===
* Appropriations Committee
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Military Construction (Chair)

==Death==
On October 6, 2024, Hobson died at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, at the age of 87.

<doc id="766892" wikidata="Q4968277" url="?curid=766892" title="Bring It On (Gomez album)">
<text>Bring It On is the debut album by English indie rock band Gomez, released on 13 April 1998 by Hut Records. Recording sessions for the album began in late 1997, during which time Gomez also toured the United Kingdom with Embrace. The first single, &quot;78 Stone Wobble&quot;, was released in March 1998, while &quot;Get Myself Arrested&quot; and &quot;Whippin&#x27; Piccadilly&quot; were later released as singles.

&quot;Bring It On&quot; experienced a boost in popularity when it won the 1998 Mercury Music Prize, beating favourites such as Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; and The Verve&#x27;s &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. Gomez later toured the United States as the support artist for Eagle-Eye Cherry.

A 10th anniversary 2-CD edition of &quot;Bring It On&quot; was released in 2008. As of September 2020, the album has sold 502,000 copies in the UK.

&quot;Bring It On&quot; is also the name of a song on Gomez&#x27;s following album, &quot;Liquid Skin&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Bring It On&quot; was released to critical acclaim. Contemporary critics praised Gomez&#x27;s ability to &quot;play the blues as though they were from the Deep South&quot; despite the band members&#x27; young ages and English origins, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;″s John O&#x27;Reilly, with the band being compared to numerous American artists. &quot;NME&quot; critic Steve Sutherland described it as &quot;one of the most assured, poised, hilarious, out-there, plain don&#x27;t-give-a-fuck enjoyable debut albums in living memory&quot;. &quot;Bring It On&quot; was awarded the 1998 Mercury Music Prize, beating out bookmakers&#x27; favourites The Verve.

The album likewise drew praise from American publications. AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato was impressed by the band&#x27;s ability to &quot;cover a lot of ground convincingly&quot; on a debut album, concluding that &quot;the praise [it] received is definitely not hype&quot;. David Stubbs of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that it transcends pastiche to become a successful &quot;product of &#x27;90s simultaneism—these days, musics from different eras and places are all equally accessible and therefore all equally contemporary... a damn beautiful record&quot;. Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honourable mention rating, naming &quot;Whippin&#x27; Piccadilly&quot; and &quot;Love Is Better Than a Warm Trombone&quot; as highlights and quipping, &quot;Really the roots-rock—they mean it, man&quot;. Neva Chonin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more critical, finding that the band &quot;excels in sonic mimicry&quot; but lacks a distinct musical identity.

In 2000 it was voted number 372 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. He stated &quot;For once, clever inventive music got out of the cult box and into the heart and soul of the record buying public&quot;.

<doc id="766895" wikidata="Q687166" url="?curid=766895" title="Frankfurt kitchen">
<text>The Frankfurt kitchen is considered an important point in domestic architecture. It is also thought to be the forerunner of modern fitted kitchens because it was the first kitchen in history built after a unified concept: low-cost design that would enable efficient work. It was designed in 1926 by Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky for architect Ernst May&#x27;s social housing project New Frankfurt in Frankfurt, Germany.

Some 10,000 units were built in the late 1920s in Frankfurt. In 1930, the USSR government requested for May to lead a “building brigade” and implement the Frankfurt model when planning new industrial towns in the Soviet Union.

==Motivation and influences ==
Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, alongside Bruno Taut and Ernst May, was among the leading housing development architects during the Weimar Republic. The housing designed by these German speaking architects attracted the labels &quot;Neues Bauen&quot; (&quot;New Building&quot;), &quot;Neues Wohnen&quot; (&quot;New Living Style&quot;), and &quot;Neues Frankfurt&quot; (&quot;New Frankfurt&quot;). In the late 1920s, &quot;Neues Bauen&quot; became a forerunner for a progressive German architecture.

The &quot;Neues Bauen&quot; architects were motivated by the desire to build healthy human settlements with access to clean air and light. Purely decorative architecture was rejected and the technology used to build industrial buildings was deployed for the construction of housing estates. The kitchen design of Schütte-Lihotzky was first installed in housing estates that were built in Frankfurt between 1926 and 1932. The Frankfurt kitchen was part of a new layout for apartments with gas stoves and central heating.

The small kitchen of the Bauhaus designed Haus am Horn, built 1923, with specific storage and drawers for specific items was also a source of inspiration for Schütte-Lihotzky.

==Impact on built-in kitchen design==
Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky continued to design kitchens. Her mid-20th century designs incorporated electrical appliances while continuing to rely on methods for efficiency advanced by Frederick Winslow Taylor and Christine Frederick.

To this day, in Germany Schütte-Lihotzky’s elaborate kitchen unit workplaces have remained the model for built-in kitchens in public housing.

==Kitchen plan==
The Frankfurt kitchen was a narrow double-file kitchen measuring . The entrance was located in one of the short walls, opposite which was the window. Along the left side, the stove was placed, followed by a sliding door connecting the kitchen to the dining and living room. On the right wall were cabinets and the sink, in front of the window a workspace. There was no refrigerator, but a foldable ironing board is visible in the image folded against the left wall.

The narrow layout of the kitchen was not due solely to the space constraints mentioned above. It was equally a conscious design decision in a Taylorist attempt to reduce the number of steps needed when working in the kitchen as well as reduce the walking distance between the kitchen and the table in the adjacent room via the addition of a sliding door.

Dedicated storage bins for common ingredients such as flour, sugar, rice and others were intended to keep the kitchen tidy and well-organized; the workspace even had an integrated, removable &quot;waste drawer&quot; such that scraps could just be shoved into it while working and the whole thing emptied at once afterwards.

Because conventional kitchen furniture of the time fit neither the new workflows nor the narrow space, the Frankfurt kitchen was installed complete with furniture and major appliances such as the stove, a novelty at that time in Germany. It was the first fitted kitchen. The wooden door and drawer fronts were painted blue because researchers had found that flies avoided blue surfaces. Lihotzky used oak wood for flour containers, because it repelled mealworms, and beech for table tops because beech is resistant to staining, acids, and scratching. The seating was a revolving stool on casters for maximum flexibility.

==Variations and further developments==
Schütte-Lihotzky actually designed three different variations of the Frankfurt kitchen. Type 1, the one described here, was the most common and least costly. She also designed &quot;Type 2&quot; and &quot;Type 3&quot;, which were larger, had tables, and were spacious enough for one or even two additional persons to help in the kitchen. These two latter types, however, did not have the impact of her &quot;Type 1&quot; model.

Erna Meyer responded to the criticisms of the Frankfurt kitchen with her &quot;Stuttgart kitchen&quot;, presented in 1927. It was slightly larger and had a more square ground plan, and used unit furniture in an attempt to make it adaptable to both the future users&#x27; needs and different room shapes.

==User acceptance and influences==
Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s Frankfurt kitchen was installed in some 10,000 units in Frankfurt and as such was a commercial success. The cost of a single kitchen, fully equipped, was moderate (a few hundred Reichsmarks); the costs were passed on to the rent (which reportedly increased the rents by per month).

However, the users of these kitchens often had their difficulties with them. Unaccustomed to Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s custom-designed workflow-centered kitchens, they often were at loss as to how to use the kitchen. It was frequently described as not flexible enough—the dedicated storage bins often were used for other things than their labels said. Another problem with these bins was that they were easily reachable by small children. Schütte-Lihotzky had designed the kitchen for one adult person only; children or even a second adult had not entered the picture; in fact, the kitchen was too small for two people to work in. Most contemporary criticism concentrated on such rather technical aspects. Nevertheless, the Frankfurt kitchen subsequently became a model for a modern work kitchen. For the rest of the 20th century, the compact yet rationalized &quot;Frankfurt kitchen&quot; became the standard of tenement buildings throughout Europe.

In the 1970s and 1980s, feminist criticism found that the emancipatory intentions that had in part motivated the development of the work kitchen had actually backfired: precisely because of the design&#x27;s &quot;specialized rationalization&quot; and its small size that allows only one person could work in them comfortably, housewives tended to become isolated from the life in the rest of the house. What had started as an emancipatory attempt by all proponents (such as Beecher, Frederick, or Meyer, who had always implicitly assumed that the kitchen was the woman&#x27;s domain) to optimize and revalue work in the home was now seen as a confinement of the woman to the kitchen.

Kitchens in the 1930s until the 1960s in Germany were often smaller and less comfortable. Housing societies thought that the Frankfurt kitchen was too luxurious. But the principles of this kitchen were adapted in other countries like Sweden and Switzerland and reimported to Germany, and recognized to be the same like the Frankfurt kitchen before. The major difference of most of the later kitchens was that the Frankfurt kitchen used relatively expensive materials and not particle boards.

==Preserved historic Frankfurt kitchens==

Most Frankfurt kitchens were thrown away in the 1960s and 1970s, when modern kitchens with easy to clean surfaces like &quot;Resopal&quot; became affordable. Often, only the aluminum drawers, which are themselves atypical of a modern kitchen, survived. They were also sold separately for a few years by Haarer, the manufacturing company and chosen by architects and cabinet makers for their furniture.

By the time public interest on the work of Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky in the late 1990s was revived, most kitchens did not exist anymore. Some homeowners have built replicas; a very few originals still exist. The original house &quot;Im Burgfeld 136, Frankfurt&quot; was chosen to be a museum because of the surviving Frankfurt kitchen.

In 2005 the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired a &quot;Frankfurt&quot; kitchen for its traveling exhibition &quot;Modernism: Designing a New World&quot; with stops in London, the US and Germany. The kitchen was dismantled from its original place, restored and repainted.

===Kitchens on auctions===
One kitchen was sold in 2005 for €22,680, another for €34,200. But these prices seem to apply only for the classic type: a white variation without the characteristic wall cupboard was sold for €11,000. 
Auctions sometimes feature the original drawers. In 2010, a piece of furniture with six drawers was sold for €380, another with ten for €1,000, and another with nine for €1,200.

<doc id="766897" wikidata="Q7535567" url="?curid=766897" title="Skinny Dip (novel)">
<text>Skinny Dip is a caper novel by Carl Hiaasen first published in 2004. It is his 11th work of fiction for adult readers. It is his fifth book featuring the character known as &quot;Skink&quot; and his second novel including the character Mick Stranahan, a former detective. It involves a murder plot and a subsequent attempt to exact revenge against the backdrop of a threat to Florida&#x27;s Everglades National Park.

== Plot introduction ==
Set in South Florida in the course of April 2003, it is about a woman, Joey Perrone, who takes revenge on her cheating husband after he has tried to murder her. It is also one of Hiaasen&#x27;s more topical novels, since the plot also revolves around the ongoing restoration of the Everglades to a natural habitat.

=== Explanation of the novel&#x27;s title ===
A &quot;skinny-dipper&quot; is someone who swims in the nude, thus showing all their skin. &quot;Skinny Dip&quot; refers to the fact that when Joey Perrone is thrown overboard the impact when hitting the surface of the water tears off all her clothes so that on the following morning her rescuer finds her not only completely exhausted but also stark naked. Also, throughout the novel people find themselves in embarrassing situations due to their – occasionally inexplicable – nakedness.

== Plot summary ==
Charles Regis &quot;Chaz&quot; Perrone is a young marine biologist who has devoted his life solely to the lazy pursuit of a hedonistic existence. His insatiable greed drives him to collude with Samuel Johnson &quot;Red&quot; Hammernut, a crooked farm tycoon who owns large vegetable fields north of the Florida Everglades, which he relentlessly pollutes with fertilizer run-off. Officially employed by the state authorities to test swamp water for pollutants, Chaz is secretly on Red&#x27;s payroll, forging the test results and allowing Red to avoid facing any regulatory measures.

One day, Chaz&#x27;s wife Joey returns home unexpectedly while he is filling in the doctored figures on a chart. As she has never taken any interest in his work, Joey has no idea what Chaz is doing. However, Chaz is so paranoid that he suddenly fears that she might report him and begins to meticulously plan a way to kill her. For their second wedding anniversary, Chaz invites Joey on a cruise and throws her overboard while they are out to sea. Being an experienced swimmer, Joey survives by managing to turn her fall into a dive and swims toward the Florida coast. As her strength gives out, she clings to a floating bale of marijuana for several hours.

The next morning, Joey is rescued by Mick Stranahan, a former investigator with the State Attorney who was forced into early retirement. Mick lives on a small island in Biscayne Bay owned by a successful but aging Mexican novelist. Mick is now in the novelist&#x27;s pay as a caretaker, leading a solitary life guarding the island. When Joey is presumed dead back on the mainland, Chaz pretends to be a grieving husband. As no witnesses come forward, the authorities accept his suggestion that Joey either had an accident or committed suicide. Karl Rolvaag, a Broward County detective investigating the disappearance, is suspicious of Chaz&#x27;s mannerisms but can find no motive supporting a suspicion of murder.

Joey is equally baffled and begs Mick not to report that she is still alive. Since she has no idea yet why he tried to kill her, she doubts that she can convince the police that it was anything besides attempted murder. Instead, she decides to drive her husband to confess by exploiting his vanity and paranoia; Mick agrees with the plan. Joey starts by entering their house while Chaz is at work and leaving traces of herself – negligees and a photo of the couple with her face cut out. Chaz is unsettled enough by these clues that he experiences erectile dysfunction, leaving him greatly flustered. Joey happens to be hiding under the bed when Chaz returns unexpectedly with one of his girlfriends and fails to have sex with her.

Worried by Chaz&#x27;s reports of a home intruder, Red orders one of his employees, an illiterate, heavy-set man called Earl Edward &quot;Tool&quot; O&#x27;Toole, to act as Chaz&#x27;s bodyguard. As Chaz&#x27;s mental state deteriorates, his job description changes to &quot;babysitter&quot;, to prevent Chaz from exposing Red. Tool, a fentanyl addict, visits nursing homes and steals fentanyl skin patches off elderly patients&#x27; bodies. During one of these expeditions he meets Maureen, a dying woman he befriends.

Joey and Mick soon develop a sexual relationship and plan more sophisticated acts of revenge. Mick has the idea of pretending to blackmail Chaz by inventing a witness to Joey&#x27;s murder. Chaz is unnerved when a mysterious phone caller seems to know every detail of Joey&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, concluding that only Karl could know so much about it. He confronts Karl with his accusation, leading the baffled detective to become even more suspicious of Chaz. Mick also recruits his brother-in-law, a corrupt lawyer, to draft a fake will leaving Joey&#x27;s entire fortune to Chaz. Delivering this to Chaz and to the police has the double effect of playing on Chaz&#x27;s greed while energizing the stagnating investigation.

Chaz&#x27;s judgment deteriorates even further, and he erroneously concludes that his current mistress, Ricca, is the blackmailer&#x27;s girlfriend and accomplice. At gunpoint, he drives her out to the swamp at Loxahatchee where, in the dark, he fires at her. Though he only manages to wing her in the leg, Ricca plunges into the water and seemingly drowns. Unbeknownst to Chaz, she survives and is rescued by a Vietnam veteran who lives in the Everglades. Both Mick and Karl, working independently, trace the bill of sale for Chaz&#x27;s expensive Hummer to one of Red&#x27;s companies, and patient investigation leads them to discover the Everglades scam.

Karl does not share his conclusions with his captain. There is no evidence directly linking the scam to Joey&#x27;s disappearance, but Karl is confident that, in his paranoid state, Chaz will break down and confess to the scam to minimize his own punishment, while Red will foresee this and try to have Chaz eliminated. Karl has even discovered hints that Joey is still alive — her credit card has been used to buy women&#x27;s clothes and accessories — but does not share this with Chaz.

Meanwhile, a few friends and relatives are let in on the truth and play along with Mick and Joey. Her brother Corbett, a reclusive sheep farmer in New Zealand, flies to Miami and hires a squadron of helicopters to buzz Chaz&#x27;s Hummer on his way to the Everglades, then arranges a memorial service for Joey at which he is expected to give a speech. Chaz gets up to deliver a eulogy but collapses with fright when Ricca enters the church on crutches and sits next to Karl in the audience. Another of Joey&#x27;s accomplices, a friend from her book club named Rose Jewell, approaches Chaz and offers to console him over dinner at her place. Expecting an easy lay, Chaz accepts the invitation, only to be drugged by Rose and put to sleep in her bed.

Only half awake, Chaz thinks he is hallucinating when he finds Joey sitting at his side asking him reproachfully why he has tried to kill her. He confesses that he thought she had figured out his scam. She replies she had no idea what he was doing and calls him a monster. The following morning, Chaz wakes up from his drug-induced slumber sitting naked at the wheel of his Hummer, which has been parked on the shoulder of a busy road during rush hour. Later he receives a video allegedly recorded on the night of the murder, in which he clearly recognizes his wife although he can see himself only from behind. The cassette includes a message summoning him to a rendezvous to deliver the blackmail money.

Following the blackmailer&#x27;s instructions, Chaz rents a small boat with an outboard motor and, together with Tool, drives to Stiltsville in the middle of a thunderstorm. Red, who has provided the money, has instructed Tool to kill Chaz before the meeting and return the suitcase to him. However, Tool has other plans: inspired by Maureen, he wants to abandon his life of crime, reform and become a respectable citizen. But before the blackmailers appear, Chaz shoots Tool, who falls into the water but survives. While Mick and Corbett pull Tool out of the water, Joey confronts her husband. She is tempted to shoot him but, following Mick&#x27;s instructions, tells him to get lost. Chaz flees in the boat.

Chaz safely arrives at the mainland with the money and immediately drives home. His new plan is to compose a suicide note, disappear and start a new life in Costa Rica. Before he can leave, he is snatched out of his house by Red and Tool, hog-tied and driven to the Everglades, Red having concluded that the &quot;blackmail&quot; was just a con by Chaz to rip him off. When Red orders Tool to shoot Chaz, Tool deliberately misses and Chaz flees into the swamp. On the way home to Red&#x27;s farm, the entrepreneur insults Tool, who takes revenge by killing him and impaling his body on the roadside.

Joey decides to stay with Mick on the island. Corbett takes an interest in Ricca and invites her to share some time in New Zealand. Karl closes the case and moves back to his native Minnesota. Tool is left with all the money, deciding to spend the first part of it on a veterinarian who removes two bullets from his body, and the second on a new pickup truck in which he embarks on a trip to Canada. He takes along Maureen, who he has rescued from the nursing home at her request, and wants to see the pelicans migrating. Chaz is picked up by the semi-deranged Vietnam veteran. In response to Chaz&#x27;s limp inquiry about what happens next, the veteran replies, &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw.&quot;

== Discussion ==
Hiaasen&#x27;s novels are often classified as &quot;Crime Fiction&quot; (or &quot;environmental thrillers&quot;), but they can also be read as satirical and comic mainstream novels depicting people in difficult and outrageous situations triggered by human weaknesses such as greed, lust, ignorance, or revenge.

=== Plot ===
In his review of &quot;Strip Tease&quot;, Donald E. Westlake commented that, at the center of all the wackiness was an accessible, touching storyline: a single mother&#x27;s quest to rescue her young daughter from a reckless husband and an inadequate foster care system. &quot;Skinny Dip&quot; has at its center a wife who survives a murder attempt by her husband, and is driven not just by the need to get even, but to find out the reason he did it. This gives the novel more focus than some of Hiaasen&#x27;s other books, which often involve the characters running across each other in random ways, or going on unplanned wanderings across Florida.

The other central plot is the fight to save the Everglades, and the role that the villains are playing in its destruction. Somewhere along the way, the two plot lines converge, and the quest to take revenge on Chaz becomes tied up with the aim of stopping Red&#x27;s pollution.

In other words, the reader is offered a choice of which thing to root for: some readers may think that Chaz&#x27;s betrayal of the environment for money makes him detestable, but trying to murder his wife is what makes him a true monster; other readers may think the exact opposite.

&quot;Skinny Dip&quot; is also enriched by a variety of subplots: Tool&#x27;s gradual moral awakening, as he grows closer to a dying old lady who is too proud to admit that she has been abandoned by her family; Karl Rolvaag&#x27;s longing for his native Minnesota, and his search for his escaped pet pythons; Chaz&#x27;s obsession with sex and his desperate attempts to reverse the erectile dysfunction which is his only sign of guilt over Joey&#x27;s murder, including experimenting with a black-market version of Viagra – &quot;the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definitely would not approve.&quot;; and finally, the suitcase full of money, which changes hands until it falls into the grip of the least likely person in the story.

The novel contains many scenes reminiscent of classic farces. For instance, at one point there are five people in the Perrone house, three of whom are trying to hide their presence from the other: at the center is Chaz and his &quot;back-up&quot; girlfriend Medea, with whom he has just unsuccessfully attempted sexual relations; hiding under the bed is Joey, caught in the middle of another infiltration of the house; Tool is in another part of the house, ordered to protect Perrone but ordered by him to stay out of the way of his date; and finally Mick, who enters in search of Joey and, when he encounters Tool, politely asks him if he&#x27;s going to try to stop Mick. (&quot;What a dumb-ass question. Of course I am.&quot;)

In a similar situation, Chaz, expecting sex with Rose, is drunk and drugged and lured into bed, not knowing that the woman he&#x27;s groping for is in fact his wife.

Other funny situations arise out of Chaz&#x27;s paranoia and ineptness as a killer. He imagines he&#x27;s surrounded by enemies, but he always manages to look in the wrong direction. Even when the truth — for example, Joey — is right in front of him, he attributes it to hallucinations caused by the West Nile virus, rather than recognizing it for a sophisticated hoax.

=== Accuracy of Environmental Reporting ===
In his review of &quot;Skinny Dip&quot; for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Michael Grunwald criticized the book as being too fictionalized, and potentially misleading, in describing the causes of the Everglades&#x27; ecological status. In Hiaasen&#x27;s scenario, the Everglades are dying as a result of agricultural contaminants dumped by greedy corporate villains, aided and abetted by corrupt or complacent officials.

Grunwald maintains that the state effort to curtail agricultural pollution is separate from the Everglades Restoration Project, and had been largely successful even before the Project commenced in 2000. Instead, the biggest threat to the Everglades comes not from corporate pollution or corrupt officials, but rather from &quot;John Q. Public&quot; – the diversion of freshwater for South Florida&#x27;s huge municipalities, and the normal waste products associated with such cities. Grunwald says that when conservation efforts should focus on curtailing the effects of public activity, it is misleading and dangerous to lay all the blame on &quot;bad guys&quot; personified by Red Hammernut and Chaz.

On the other hand, Grunwald agrees that it is &quot;smart to be cynical&quot; about Florida politics, &quot;especially all the daily blathering about conserving our precious natural resources.&quot; A recurring theme in Grunwald&#x27;s book, &quot;The Swamp&quot;, is that for the majority of Florida&#x27;s history, the Everglades has been viewed as a hostile territory, a nuisance, or an obstacle to growth, and only very recently has perception changed to regard it as a place worth saving.

Hiaasen is also scathing about this in the chapter when he briefly summarizes the history of the Everglades, and how ninety percent of it has been destroyed through the course of South Florida&#x27;s development:

Inevitably, the Everglades and all its resplendent wildlife began to die, but no one with the power to prevent it even considered trying. It was, after all, just a huge damn swamp.

But later, it became clear that the Everglades&#x27; health was linked to South Florida&#x27;s drinking water, and if the Everglades died, then growth would stop dead:

This apocalyptic scenario was laid out before Florida&#x27;s politicians, and in no time at all even the most slatternly among them was extolling the Everglades as a national treasure, that must be preserved at all costs.

== Continuity ==
*Mick Stranahan is the protagonist of Hiaasen&#x27;s third novel &quot;Skin Tight&quot;.
*Other characters from &quot;Skin Tight&quot; also make brief appearances, including Mick&#x27;s brother-in-law, crooked lawyer Kipper Garth, and Marine Patrol Officer Luis Cordova.
*&quot;Skinny Dip&quot; makes an oblique reference to Christina Marks, the female protagonist of &quot;Skin Tight&quot;, in confirming that Christina married Mick, and later divorced him.
*The hermit who rescues Ricca is &quot;Skink&quot; aka Clinton Tyree, a recurring character in Hiaasen&#x27;s novels. The unnamed &quot;intense young man&quot; accompanying him is most likely Twilly Spree, the protagonist of &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;.
*In Hiaasen&#x27;s book &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, Skink takes another character to a stilt house in Biscayne Bay, saying that it used to be occupied by a former Investigator for the State Attorney&#x27;s Office, who had &quot;recently married a beautiful twelve-string guitarist and moved to the Island of Exuma.&quot; Assuming this is a reference to Mick, this is a slight discontinuity with &quot;Skinny Dip&quot;, in which he lists his number of ex-wives as six: the five mentioned in &quot;Skin Tight&quot;, plus Christina.
*Hiaasen&#x27;s novels often feature a recurring joke that radiology is a &quot;soft&quot; medical discipline, and those that practice it are not &quot;real&quot; doctors. In this novel, Chaz&#x27;s backstory explains that his original ambition was to go to medical school and become a radiologist, which struck him as an appealing way to become wealthy without &quot;interacting with actual sick people,&quot; and leave him plenty of leisure time to maintain his sex life.
*In the book&#x27;s opening chapter, Joey is disappointed to see that the cruise line&#x27;s &quot;private island&quot; has been minimally altered since being acquired from its previous owner, a drug smuggler. In his non-fiction book &quot;Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World&quot;, Hiaasen pointed out that Disney Cruise Line&#x27;s inaugural trip plan featured a stop at &quot;Castaway Cay&quot;, formerly Gorda Kay, the site of an illicit airstrip used for drug trafficking to South Florida.

<text>The orgasmic platform is the tissues of the outer third of the vagina, labeled by Masters and Johnson. They swell considerably, and the pubococcygeus muscle tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. During orgasm, women experience rhythmic contractions of the orgasmic platform.
The orgasmic platform is brought about through the swelling of the bulbus vestibuli that narrows the vestibulum.
It is actually the narrowing and the extending of the lower 1/3 of the sheath.

<text>John Andrew Boehner ( ; born , 1949) is an American politician who served as the 53rd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he served 13 terms as the U.S. representative for from 1991 to 2015. The district included several rural and suburban areas near Cincinnati and Dayton.

Boehner previously served as the House Minority Leader from 2007 until 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. In January 2011, he was first elected Speaker and then re-elected twice. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican conference.

In September 2016, Squire Patton Boggs, the third-largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. It was also announced that he would become a board member of Reynolds American.

== Early life and education ==
Boehner was born in Reading, Ohio, the son of Mary Anne (; 1926–1998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925–1990), the second of twelve children. His father was of German descent and his mother had German and Irish ancestry. He grew up in modest circumstances, sharing one bathroom with his eleven siblings in a two-bedroom house in Cincinnati. He started working at his family&#x27;s bar at age 8, a business founded by their grandfather Andy Boehner in 1938. He has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life.

Boehner attended Cincinnati&#x27;s Moeller High School and was a linebacker on the school&#x27;s football team, where he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust. Graduating from Moeller in 1968, when United States involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks because of a bad back. He earned his B.A. in business administration from Xavier University in 1977, becoming the first person in his family to attend college, taking seven years as he held several jobs to pay for his education.

== Early career ==
Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the plastics industry. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.

From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of Union Township, Butler County, Ohio. He then served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1985 to 1990.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman Buz Lukens, who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. He was all but unknown when he entered a Republican primary that included Lukens and former Congressman Tom Kindness. Despite being dramatically outspent, Boehner won with 49 percent of the vote. He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, Greg Jolivette, in the November election. He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.

Boehner&#x27;s closest races were those in:
* 2006, when he defeated the Democratic Party candidate, U.S. Air Force veteran Mort Meier, 64% to 36%;
* 2008, when he defeated Nicholas Von Stein, 68% to 32%;
* 2010, when he garnered 66% percent of the vote in a four-way race against Democratic nominee Justin Coussoule, Constitution Party nominee Jim Condit, and Libertarian nominee David Harlow.

=== Gang of Seven and &quot;Contract with America&quot; ===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal. The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the &quot;Contract with America&quot; in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

=== Republican leadership ===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as House Republican Conference Chairman, making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay. During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the Freedom to Farm Act that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted &quot;coup&quot; began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democratsalong with dissenting Republicanswould vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign from his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.

After Republicans lost seats in the 1998 elections, the House Republican leadership underwent a reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced by Dennis Hastert, and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to J.C. Watts.

=== Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor ===
Following the election of President George W. Bush, Boehner was elected as chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, serving from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the Pension Protection Act and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, D.C.

Boehner and Senator Ted Kennedy authored the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which was signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Boehner said that it was his &quot;proudest achievement&quot; in two decades of public service. Boehner was friends with Kennedy, also a Catholic, and every year they chaired fundraisers for cash-strapped Catholic schools.

=== House Republican Leader ===

After DeLay resigned as majority leader in 2005, Boehner, House Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, all sought to become Majority Leader. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called &quot;earmark&quot; process and rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as majority whip, the no. 3 leadership positions in the House. There was some confusion on the first ballot for majority leader when the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present, due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico Luis Fortuño to vote.

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as the minority leader. While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as minority leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Nancy Pelosi.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander M. Levin, Dean of the House John Dingell, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican. As minority leader, Boehner served as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

== Speaker of the House (2011–2015) ==

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about &quot;economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I&#x27;ve lived them...I&#x27;ve spent my whole life chasing the American Dream&quot;. On November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker, all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011. He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on Wednesday, January 5, 2011. He was the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883). He was also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.
As Speaker, he was still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition, he normally did not take part in debate, although he had the right to do so, and rarely voted from the floor. He was not a member of any House committees during his Speakership.

Boehner was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House on January 3, 2013, at the beginning of the 113th United States Congress. He received 220 votes, needing 214 to win.

In July 2014, Boehner moved forward on a lawsuit to force the President to impose penalties on companies who failed to provide healthcare coverage for their employees. Boehner had pressed for legislation to delay this mandate the previous year. The third law firm selected finally filed the suit in November 2014, after Boehner criticized Obama&#x27;s unilateral moves on immigration policy.

=== Resignation ===
On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner&#x27;s resignation took place after Pope Francis&#x27; address to Congress the day before, an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage the passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government. Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner&#x27;s leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the resignation.

Originally, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California had intended to run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly rescinded his candidacy, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Conference. After McCarthy&#x27;s announcement, Boehner stayed on as Speaker until a successor was chosen. After initially turning down requests from Republican leaders, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Ways and Means Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, ran for Speaker with Boehner&#x27;s blessing. On October 29, 2015, in his final act as Speaker, Boehner presided over Ryan&#x27;s election. Boehner&#x27;s resignation from Congress became official on October 31, 2015, at 11:59 p.m.

== Political positions ==
A profile in the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; said, &quot;On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen.&quot; &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; says Boehner &quot;has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable.&quot;

Boehner has been classified as a &quot;hard-core conservative&quot; by OnTheIssues. Although Boehner has a conservative voting record when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;From illegal immigration to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs.&quot;

Boehner opposes same-sex marriage, as evidenced by his vote for the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006. In a letter to the Human Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, &quot;I oppose any legislation that would provide special rights for homosexuals... Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of the traditional family as one of the fundamental tenets of western civilization.&quot;

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his &quot;Democrat friends&quot; such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters &quot;have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq.&quot;

Boehner is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

In June 2013, Boehner labeled former NSA contractor Edward Snowden a traitor after his leaks went public.

&quot;I&#x27;m not qualified to debate the science over climate change&quot;, Boehner said at a press conference on May 29, 2014, at which he criticized proposed federal regulations on coal-fired power plants.

In 2011, Boehner opposed the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. In 2015, Boehner supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying: &quot;I applaud the Saudis for taking this action to protect their homeland and to protect their neighborhood.&quot;

=== Financial crisis ===

On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.

On October 3, 2008, Boehner voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to &quot;purchase assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector.&quot;

Boehner had been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama, including the &quot;cap and trade&quot; plan that Boehner said would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying &quot;one dime&quot; of the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan. He also led opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama&#x27;s first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI). He advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs.
Boehner favored making changes in Social Security, such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation, and limiting payments to those who need them.

In 2011, Boehner called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act &quot;one of our highest legislative priorities.&quot;

In 2013, Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to freeze Defense spending in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.

As Republican House Leader, Boehner was a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions. In July 2010, President Barack Obama began singling out Boehner for criticism during his speeches. In one speech, Obama mentioned Boehner&#x27;s name nine times, and accused him of believing that police, firefighters, and teachers were jobs &quot;not worth saving&quot;.

== Later career ==
=== Politics ===
Boehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz as &quot;Lucifer in the flesh&quot; in an interview at Stanford University. On May 12, after Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner&#x27;s support for him (while distancing himself from Trump on several policies) became public; he also expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: &quot;Thank God the guy from Texas didn&#x27;t win.&quot; On February 23, 2017, Boehner predicted Republicans would &quot;fix&quot; the Affordable Care Act and give it a different name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace.

On August 17, 2020, a spokesperson for Boehner stated that he would not endorse either President Trump or Joe Biden for the 2020 United States presidential election, saying: &quot;The answer is no. I think he&#x27;d rather set himself on fire than get involved in the election. Nothing to see here.&quot; Despite his critiques, Boehner confirmed he voted for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Explaining his vote, he said: &quot;At the end of the day, who gets nominated to the federal courts is the most important thing a President does.&quot;

After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Boehner called on Republicans to &quot;awaken&quot;, saying: &quot;The invasion of our Capitol by a mob, incited by lies from some entrusted with power, is a disgrace to all who sacrificed to build our Republic.&quot; Boehner later congratulated Biden on his victory after the vote was certified. He has frequently reiterated his feelings, on one account noting how Trump &quot;Incited That Bloody Insurrection&quot;, and called Ted Cruz &quot;a reckless asshole who thinks he is smarter than everyone else&quot;. Boehner said that Trump should &quot;consider resigning&quot; and that President Trump had &quot;violated his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&quot; Boehner continued to express his disdain for Trump through 2023, where he stated his belief that the GOP needs to &quot;move on&quot; from Trump during a June interview with CBS News.

Boehner&#x27;s political memoir, titled &quot;On the House: A Washington Memoir&quot;, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press on April 13, 2021. Excerpts began appearing early in April. In this memoir, he lambasts Cruz, Michele Bachmann, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Trump. It also covers how the Tea Party movement, which forced him into retirement, later morphed into Trumpism. In response to the criticism he received in the book, Cruz threatened to burn Boehner&#x27;s book if his supporters could fulfil his “72-hour drive to raise $250,000” in campaign funds.

Despite his resignation from politics, during the October 2023 Speaker of the House election following the removal of Kevin McCarthy, Boehner received one vote to reprise his role as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

=== Business ===
Boehner joined the board of tobacco company Reynolds American on September 15, 2016. In 2018, Boehner joined the board of Acreage Holdings, a cannabis corporation, to promote the medical use of cannabis and advocate for federal de-scheduling of the drug (a shift from his previous stance while in Congress). In 2019, Boehner was named chair of the National Cannabis Roundtable, a cannabis lobbying organization.

== Controversies ==
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies. In a 1996 documentary by PBS called &quot;The People and the Power Game&quot;, Boehner said &quot;They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done so. It&#x27;s not a violation of the House rules, but it&#x27;s a practice that&#x27;s gone on here for a long time that we&#x27;re trying to stop and I know I&#x27;ll never do it again.&quot; Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor. A September 2010 story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Boehner was &quot;Tightly Bound to Lobbyists&quot; and that &quot;He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation&#x27;s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.&quot;.

In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery after he learned that it featured a video by David Wojnarowicz, &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot;, that contained an image of a crucifix with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, &quot;Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in].&quot;

On January 1, 2013, after passing the fiscal cliff deal, Boehner adjourned the House without passing the $60 million Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie harshly criticized Boehner. Boehner later promised to pass the bill.

Many Republicans were ready for a new House of Representatives Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections. &quot;EMC Research&quot; reported 60% of participants in their telephone survey wanted a new chairman. In the end there were a total of 25 votes against Boehner; 29 were needed in order to choose a new speaker. Boehner responded by removing those who opposed him from influential committees.

== Legacy ==
In reporting his pending retirement, &quot;Politico&quot; summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama triedbut repeatedly failedto cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.

Paul Kane in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; emphasizes how none of the &quot;big deals&quot; he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.

Furthermore, Kane argues, Boehner&#x27;s persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, &quot;a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner&#x27;s easygoing style did not fit.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and lived in the Wetherington section of West Chester Township, Ohio. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia. Boehner has been known to be emotional and cry during noteworthy events.

On May 15, 2016, Boehner was awarded the Laetare Medal, considered the highest honor for American Catholics, by the University of Notre Dame. The medal was awarded to Joe Biden at the same time.

<text>Mark Henryk Serwotka (; born 26 April 1963) is a retired trade unionist who was General Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest trade union representing British civil servants. He was President of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) for 2019.

==Early life==
Serwotka was adopted by a Polish-born father and a Welsh mother and brought up in Aberdare.

==Career==
In 1979, aged sixteen, he joined the Civil Service as a benefits clerk, joining the union on his first day. He became a union representative in 1980 and a personal case officer in 1995.

In the 2000 election for General Secretary, he faced two rivals: Hugh Lanning of the Membership First faction and the incumbent Barry Reamsbottom of the National Moderate Group. However, Reamsbottom did not secure the fifty branch nominations needed to appear on the ballot paper. Serwotka then beat Lanning with 41,000 to 33,000 votes. Following Serwotka&#x27;s election, Reamsbottom refused to step down when his term of office expired, citing what he claimed were legal irregularities in the election process. The dispute was taken to the High Court where Serwotka won and subsequently assumed office.

In 2005, Serwotka was elected unopposed for another term as General Secretary as he was the only candidate with the required 25 branch nominations. In 2009, Serwotka was re-elected for a five-year term, with 37,866 votes to Rob Bryson&#x27;s 21,883. In 2014, he was elected unopposed for a fourth five-year term.

In the 2000 General Secretary election, Serwotka pledged that if elected he would only accept the equivalent of an average civil servant&#x27;s wage. Serwotka returns around £8,000 of his annual salary to the union.

Serwotka was elected President of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) for 2019, a prominent but largely honorary position.

In May 2023, Serwotka announces his intention to retire after 24 years, with his tenure ending at the end of January 2024 after the election of Fran Heathcote as his replacement.

==Political views==
Serwotka was a member of &quot;Socialist Organiser&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was later a supporter of the Socialist Alliance and then Respect.

In February 2013, he was among those who gave their support to the People&#x27;s Assembly in a letter published by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

He attempted to vote in the 2015 Labour Leadership Election, but was among those who had their vote rejected by the party. In March 2016, he rejoined the Labour Party after being expelled from it over 25 years earlier. He wrote in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;: &quot;Jeremy [Corbyn] is the first Labour leader in a generation who unequivocally supports the unions and his opposition to the trade union bill has been crucial.&quot; He added &quot;I have joined to support Jeremy in transforming the party. And I want as many people as possible to join Labour, and to get involved in the fight against cuts where they live. This is our chance to build a social movement and form a government that can offer hope to the millions of people that deserve so much better than these contemptible Tories.&quot;

==Personal life==
Serwotka is married to Ruth Serwotka, co-founder of the organisation Woman&#x27;s Place UK, a gender-critical advocacy group that is opposed to gender self-identification for trans people in the UK.

In September 2010, Serwotka was named as one of the hundred most influential British Catholics by &quot;The Tablet&quot;.

In 2013 he was fitted with a battery-powered ventricular assist device after picking up a viral infection from the family dog. He was readmitted to hospital on 30 August 2016, when the ventricular assist device developed a clot and his doctors then placed him on the urgent transplant list. In December 2016 he had a heart transplant at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire.

<text>The Nathan&#x27;s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest is an annual American hot dog competitive eating competition. It is held each year on July 4 at Nathan&#x27;s Famous&#x27; original, and best-known, restaurant at the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City.

The contest has gained public attention since the mid-2000s due to the stardom of Takeru &quot;The Tsunami&quot; Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut. The defending men&#x27;s champion is Patrick Bertoletti, who ate 58 hot dogs in the 2024 contest. The defending women&#x27;s champion is Miki Sudo, who ate 51 hot dogs in 2024.

==Rules==

Major League Eating (MLE), sanctioned by the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.

The field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:

* any past champion;
* winners of a regional qualifying contest for that season;
* individuals qualifying as one of two wildcards (highest two average qualifier scores without winning a single qualifier); and
* those invited by special invitation of the MLE.

The competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan&#x27;s Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant who consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.

Spectators watch and cheer on the eaters from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the granularity of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. Yellow penalty cards can be issued for &quot;messy eating&quot;, and red penalty cards can be issued for &quot;reversal of fortune&quot; (vomiting), which results in disqualification. If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many the quickest. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.

After the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.

==Awards==

The winner of the men&#x27;s competition is of the coveted international &quot;bejeweled&quot; mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of &quot;unknown age and value&quot; according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, Sonya Thomas won the inaugural women&#x27;s competition and its &quot;bejeweled&quot; pink belt.

Various other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 Orbitz donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.

==History==
The Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with Independence Day. As Coney Island is often linked with recreational activities of the summer season, several early contests were held on other holidays associated with summer besides Independence Day; for example, multiple contests in the 1970s were scheduled on Memorial Day or Labor Day.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the competition was dominated by Japanese contestants, particularly Kobayashi, who won six consecutive contests from 2001 to 2006. In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs—smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous competitive eating world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.

In recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual spectacle of competitive entertainment. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the mayor of New York City. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or makeup, while others may promote themselves with eating-related nicknames. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the &quot;bus of champions&quot; and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion Joey Chestnut was escorted to the stage in a sedan chair.

The competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2004 a three-story-high &quot;Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame&quot; was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. Despite substantial damage suffered at Nathan&#x27;s due to Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.

ESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with Major League Eating and would broadcast the contest through 2024. The most recent broadcast rights deal, announced in November 2022, will keep the contest airing on ESPN through 2029.
In 2003 former National Football League player William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. The celebrity contestant experiment has not been held since.

At the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion Kobayashi had vomited (also known as a &quot;Roman method incident&quot; or &quot;reversal of fortune&quot;) in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi&#x27;s favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002 in a victory over Eric &quot;Badlands&quot; Booker.

On July 4, 2011, Sonya Thomas became the champion of the first Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women. Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one Memorial Day competition held in 1975. Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the contest was held without spectators at an indoor location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and only five eaters competed in each category instead of the usual 15. In 2021, the event was held at Maimonides Park, with a reduced crowd of 7,000.

=== Competitor bans ===
Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest. In 2010, he was arrested by police after attempting to jump on the stage after the contest was over and disrupt the proceedings. Some witnesses reported that Kobayashi was attempting to congratulate the winner, Chestnut. On August 5, 2010, all charges against Kobayashi were dismissed by a judge in Brooklyn. Despite his six consecutive victories in their annual event, Nathan&#x27;s removed Kobayashi&#x27;s image from their &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; in 2011. Kobayashi again refused to compete in 2011, but instead conducted his own hot dog eating exhibition, consuming 69 HDB, seven more than Chestnut accomplished in the Nathan&#x27;s contest. The sports website Deadspin deemed Kobayashi&#x27;s solo appearance &quot;an improbably perfect &#x27;up yours&#x27; to the Nathan&#x27;s hot dog eating contest.&quot;

Chestnut was banned from the 2024 contest due to signing a deal with Impossible Food, which sells plant based products including hot dogs. A Major League Eating executive claimed that Nathan&#x27;s asked for an exemption to the deal be made regarding Impossible Food&#x27;s hot dogs which was denied with Major League Eating banning Chestnut as a result. On June 25, Chestnut instead agreed to attend Fort Bliss&#x27; Pop Goes the Fort celebration and compete in a 4 versus 1 eating competition with a five minute time limit, with Chestnut prevailing 57 to 49 while raising $106,000 for Operation Homefront.

=== Fake history of the contest ===
In 2010, Nathan&#x27;s promoter Mortimer &quot;Morty&quot; Matz admitted to having fabricated the legend of the 1916 start date with a man named Max Rosey in the early 1970s as part of a publicity stunt. 

According to that legend, on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan&#x27;s Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most patriotic. Some accounts alleged that a man named Jim Mullen won the first contest. Others described Jimmy Durante, who was &quot;not&quot; an immigrant, as competing in that all-immigrant inaugural contest, which was judged by Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker. Another co-founder describes the event as beginning &quot;in 1917, and pitted Mae West&#x27;s father, Jack, against entertainer Eddie Cantor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crown/Archetype (p. 222)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941, &quot;as a protest to the war in Europe&quot;, and 1971, as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.

The legend grew over the years, to the point where &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other publications were known to have repeatedly listed 1916 as the inaugural year, although no evidence of the contest exists.

==Media coverage==

===Live TV===
In 2003, ESPN aired the contest for the first time on a tape-delayed basis. Starting in 2004, ESPN began airing the contest live. From 2005 to 2017, Paul Page was ESPN&#x27;s play-by-play announcer for the event, accompanied by color commentator Richard Shea. In 2011, the women&#x27;s competition was carried live on ESPN3, followed by the men&#x27;s competition on ESPN. In 2012, ESPN signed an extension to carry the event through 2017. In 2014, ESPN signed an agreement to carry the competition on its networks for 10 years until 2024.

In 2021, Miki Sudo did not compete, as she was 37 weeks pregnant with her first child with fellow professional eater, Nick Wehry. Sudo instead served as an announcer, alongside Mike Golic Jr., Richard Shea, and Jason Fitz.

===Newspapers===
News sources typically use puns in head-lines and copy referring to the contest, such as Tsunami&#x27; is eating contest&#x27;s top dog again&quot;, &quot;couldn&#x27;t cut the mustard&quot; (A.P.), &quot;Nathan&#x27;s King ready, with relish&quot; (Daily News) and &quot;To be frank, Fridge faces a real hot-dog consumer&quot; (ESPN).

Reporter Gersh Kuntzman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; has been covering the event since the early 1990s and has been a judge at the competition since 2000. Darren Rovell, of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.

==Tactics and training==
Each contestant has his or her own eating method. Takeru Kobayashi pioneered the &quot;Solomon Method&quot; at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.

&quot;Dunking&quot; is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.

Other methods used include the &quot;Carlene Pop&quot;, where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach. &quot;Buns &amp; Roses&quot; is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead. &quot;Juliet-ing&quot; is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.

Contestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some fast; others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed &quot;Cookie&quot; Jarvis, aim to be &quot;hungry, but not too hungry&quot; and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.

<doc id="766906" wikidata="Q238871" url="?curid=766906" title="Diane Cilento">
<text>Elizabeth Diane Cilento (2 April 1932 – 6 October 2011) was an Australian actress. She is best known for her film roles in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), which earned her an Academy Award nomination, &quot;Hombre&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973). She also received a Tony Award nomination for her performance as Helen of Troy in the play &quot;Tiger at the Gates&quot;.

==Early life==
Cilento was born on 2 April 1932 in Brisbane, Queensland, the daughter of Phyllis (née McGlew) and Raphael Cilento, both medical practitioners in Queensland. She was the fifth of six children; four of her siblings became medical practitioners, while her sister Margaret was an artist. Cilento&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, Salvatore Cilento, arrived from Naples, Italy, in 1855.

It was from a young age that Cilento decided to follow a career as an actress. After being expelled from school in Australia, she was schooled in New York while living with her father. Cilento later won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and moved to Britain in the early 1950s.

==Career==
After graduation, Cilento found work on stage almost immediately and was signed to a five-year contract by Alexander Korda. Her first leading film role was in the British film &quot;Passage Home&quot; (1955), opposite fellow Australian Peter Finch.
She soon secured roles in British films and worked steadily until the end of the decade. In 1956, she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic) for Helen of Troy in Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Tiger at the Gates&quot;. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; in 1963 and appeared in &quot;The Third Secret&quot; the following year.

She starred with Charlton Heston in the 1965 film &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot;, and with Paul Newman in the 1967 western film &quot;Hombre&quot;, and had a supporting role in &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973).

Cilento continued working as an actress, in films and television. In the 1980s, she settled in Mossman, north of Cairns, where she built her own outdoor theatre, named &quot;Karnak&quot;, in the tropical rainforest. The venture allowed her to participate in experimental drama.

In 2001, she was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;distinguished service to the arts, especially theatre&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Cilento married Andrea Volpe, an Italian. She gave birth to their daughter Giovanna in 1957. Cilento and Volpe divorced in 1962. Later that year, Cilento married actor Sean Connery, with whom she had a son, Jason (born 1963). Cilento and Connery separated in 1971 and divorced in 1974. In her autobiography &quot;My Nine Lives&quot;, Cilento said that Connery was emotionally and physically abusive during their marriage. In 1985, Cilento married playwright Anthony Shaffer, whom she met in 1972 while working on &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. They remained married until his death in 2001.

==Death==
Cilento died of cancer at Cairns Base Hospital on 6 October 2011.

<doc id="766918" wikidata="Q393332" url="?curid=766918" title="Žagarė">
<text>Žagarė (, see also other names) is a city located in the Joniškis district, northern Lithuania, close to the border with Latvia. It has a population of about 2,000, down from 14,000 in 1914, when it was the 7th largest city in Lithuania. Žagarė is famous for &quot;Žagarvyšnė&quot; - a cherry species originated in Žagarė.

==Etymology==
Žagarė&#x27;s name is probably derived from the Lithuanian word &quot;žagaras,&quot; meaning &quot;twig&quot;. Other renderings of the name include: , , , .

==History==
The foundation of Žagarė dates back to the 12th century. A settlement of the Baltic tribe Semigallians &quot;Sagera&quot; was mentioned for the first time in March 1254 in the documents of the partitioning of the Semigallia. In 13th century it was a Semigalian fortress &quot;Raktuvė&quot; (or &quot;Raktė&quot;, first mentioned in 1272-1289 documents). It was an important centre of Semigallian warriors, who fought against the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Livonian Order. The cult of Barbora Žagarietė, servant of God, originated in the town in mid-1600s.

It long had a Jewish population that contributed to its culture. Yisroel Salanter (1810–1883), the father of the 19th-century Mussar movement in Orthodox Judaism, was born there. Isaak Kikoin (1908–1984), a renowned Soviet physicist, was also born there.

The Jewish quarter in Žagarė was among those damaged in 1881 as part of the violence against Jews that occurred during the pogroms in southern Russia.

During World War II, the town was under Soviet occupation from 1940, and then under German occupation from 1941 to 1944. On 22 August 1941, on the orders of Šiauliai Gebietskommissar Hans Gewecke, all half-Jews and Jews in the district were to be moved to Žagarė ghetto (around 500 people). The Jews were allowed only to take clothing and at most 200 Reichsmark. Many Jews were shot on the spot instead of being sent to the ghetto. In a massacre committed by Einsatzgruppe A on 2 October 1941, the date of Yom Kippur that year, all Jews were killed at the marketplace and buried in Naryshkin Park.

Today Žagarė is the administrative centre of the Žagarė Regional Park, known for its valuable urban and natural heritage. Once one of the largest cities in Lithuania (in the 1900s the number of town inhabitants exceeded 10 thousand), it preserved valuable urban complexes – trade square, side street network with early 20th century brick buildings, two churches, Žagarė manor with park, former early 20 c. cinema building and other valuable urban artefacts.

<text>Huntington Avenue American League Baseball Grounds is the full name of the baseball stadium that formerly stood in Boston, Massachusetts, and was the first home field for the Boston Red Sox, known informally as the &quot;Boston Americans&quot; before 1908, from to . The stadium, built for $35,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), was located on what is now Northeastern University, at the time across the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks from the South End Grounds, home of the Boston Braves. 
The stadium was the site of the first World Series game between the modern American and National Leagues in 1903, and also saw the first perfect game in the modern era, thrown by Cy Young on May 5, 1904. The playing field was built on a former circus lot and was extremely large by modern standards - to center field, later expanded to in 1908. It had many quirks not seen in modern baseball stadiums, including patches of sand in the outfield where grass would not grow, and a tool shed in deep center field that was in play.

The park was built on a large plot of land bounded by Huntington Avenue (northwest, left field); Rogers (now Forsyth) Street (southwest, third base); railroad tracks (southeast, first base); and various buildings to the east (right field).

The Huntington Avenue Grounds was demolished after the Red Sox left at the beginning of the 1912 season to play at Fenway Park. The Cabot Center, an indoor athletic venue belonging to Northeastern University, has stood on the Huntington Grounds&#x27; footprint since 1954. A plaque and a statue of Cy Young were erected in 1993 where the pitchers mound used to be, commemorating the history of this ballpark in what is now called World Series Way. Meanwhile, a plaque on the side of the Cabot Center (1956) marks the former location of the left field foul pole.

The Cabot facility itself is barely over a quarter mile away to the southwest from another, still-standing Boston area sports facility of that era, Matthews Arena (built in 1910), the original home of the NHL&#x27;s Boston Bruins when they started play in 1924.

<text>The Irish Setter (, literally &quot;red setter&quot;) is a setter, a breed of gundog, and family dog originating in Ireland. The term &quot;Irish Setter&quot; is commonly used to encompass the show-bred dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as well as the field-bred Red Setter recognised by the Field Dog Stud Book.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The coat is moderately long, silky, and of a red or chestnut colour. It requires frequent brushing to maintain its condition and keep it mat-free. The undercoat is abundant in winter weather, and the top coat is fine. Their coats should also feather in places such as the tail, ears, chest, legs, and body. Irish Setters range in height from , males weigh and females . The FCI Breed Standard for the Irish Setter stipulates males stand tall, and females be tall.
Irish Setters are deep chested dogs with small waists. An Irish Setter&#x27;s life expectancy tends to be around 11 to 12 years.

===Temperament===
Irish Setters get along well with children and other dogs and will greet visitors enthusiastically. Even though they do well with household pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed. Some Irish Setters may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too boisterous with small children. As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be &quot;Demonstrably affectionate.&quot; As a result, Irish Setters make excellent companion animals and family pets.

Irish Setters are an active breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces. They are, however, a breed with a tendency to &#x27;play deaf,&#x27; so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead.

Irish Setters enjoy having a job to do. Lack of activity will lead to a bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. Irish Setters thrive on constant human companionship. Irish Setters respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.

Though they are usually alert to their surroundings, Irish Setters are not well-suited as guard dogs, as they are not a naturally assertive breed.

Irish Setters are also widely used as therapy dogs in schools and hospitals. Therapy dogs are permitted in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. In schools the dogs may be used to create a calming and relaxed environment. A child may read to a dog without being corrected or judged.

==History==
One of the first references to the &#x27;Setter,&#x27; or setting dog, in literature can be found in Caius&#x27;s &quot;De Canibus Britannicus&quot;, which was published in 1570 (with a revised version published in 1576). Translated from the original Latin, the text reads:
It would be incorrect to assume the dog described above in any way resembles the Irish Setter (or any setter) as we know the breed today. Caius was referring to a type of setting spaniel, most likely now extinct. The description of the work undertaken by this early pillar of the breed resembles the working behaviour of modern Irish Setters. Of this early dog, Caius went on to write: &quot;The most part of theyre skinnes are white, and if they are marcked with any spottes, they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall.&quot; If this is the case, it is safe to assume the solid red colouring of today&#x27;s Irish Setter came about by selective breeding practices.

Further reference to setters in early literature can be found in &quot;The Country Farme&quot; by Richard Surflet and Gervase Markham, published in 1616. They wrote: &quot;There is also another sort of land spannyels which are called Setters.&quot;

It is clear that, by the early 18th Century, the type of dog known as the &#x27;setter&#x27; had come into its own right. It is also clear the Irish had begun actively breeding their own type. For example, the de Freyne family of French Park began keeping detailed stud records in 1793. Other prominent landed Irish gentry also known to have been breeding setter lines at the same time include Lord Clancarty, Lord Dillon, and the Marquis of Waterford.

It was noted as early as 1845 that setters in Ireland were predominantly either red, or, according to Youatt, &quot;...very red, or red and white, or lemon coloured, or white patched with deep chestnut.&quot; Clearly, the preference for a solid red-coloured dog was having an effect on the appearance of the typical Irish-bred setter.

The breed standard for the modern Irish Setter was first drawn up by the Irish Red Setter Club in Dublin and approved on 29 March 1886. It consisted of a 100-point scale, with a given number of points awarded for each of the dog&#x27;s physical attributes. The points system was later dropped; however, aside from some minor changes, the standard remains largely unchanged today in most countries where the breed is formally recognised.

==Uses==
The Irish Setter was bred for hunting, specifically for setting or locating and pointing upland gamebirds. They are a tireless, wide-ranging hunter, and well-suited to fields and wet or dry moorland terrain. Using their excellent sense of smell to locate the mark (or bird), the Irish Setter will then hold a pointing position, indicating the direction in which the bird lies hidden.

The Irish Setter was brought to the United States in the early 19th century.

In 1874, the American Field put together the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United States was born. This Field Dog Stud Book is the oldest pure-bred registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of English Setter and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red Irish Setter became a favourite in the dog show ring.

Not all Irish Setters of the late 19th century were red, the American Kennel Club registered Irish Setters in myriad colours. Frank Forester, a 19th-century sports writer, described the Irish Setter as follows: &quot;The points of the Irish Setter are more bony, angular, and wiry frame, a longer head, a less silky and straighter coat that those of the English. His colour ought to be a deep orange-red and white, a common mark is a stripe of white between the eyes and a white ring around the neck, white stockings, and a white tage to the tail.&quot;

The Setter that was completely red, however, was preferred in the show ring and that is the direction that the breed took. Between 1874 and 1948, the breed produced 760 conformation show champions, but only five field champions.

In the 1940s, &quot;Field and Stream&quot; magazine put into writing what was already a well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing from the field and an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. &quot;Sports Afield&quot; chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.

Prior to 1975, a relationship existed between the American Kennel Club and the Field Dog Stud Book in which registration with one body qualified a dog for registration with the other. In 1975 the Irish Setter Club of America petitioned the American Kennel Club to deny reciprocal registration, and the request was granted. It is claimed, by critics of the move, that the pressure was placed on the American Kennel Club by bench show enthusiasts who were unappreciative of the outcrossing efforts of the National Red Setter Field Trial Club, as well as some field trialers from the American Kennel Club after a series of losses to Field Dog Stud book red setters. Working Irish Setter kennels today field champion dogs that claim lines from both the Field Dog Stud Book and the American Kennel Club.

===Working Red Setter===
The modern Red Setter is smaller than its bench-bred cousin. While show dogs often reach 70 lb (32 kg), the Working Red Setter is generally around . The coat is less silky and the feathering is generally shorter. The colour is lighter, with the working dog found in russet and fawn colours. The Red Setter often has patches of white on its face and chest as the Irish Setter of old did. There have been efforts to rekindle the field abilities of the true type Irish by a handful of dedicated breeders in California and elsewhere with some success. More than a dozen American Kennel Club Dual Champion Irish Setters have been made, evidence of the dog&#x27;s native ability when proper traits are selectively sought in breeding.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Gluten intolerance in Irish Setters is a naturally occurring genetic disorder that is the result of a single autosomal recessive locus. At around 6 months of age, Irish Setters with this condition will develop an increased immune cell presence and a decrease in absorption within the small intestine when fed a gluten containing diet. These effects lead to further damage of the small intestine as well as malnutrition and diarrhea. Irish Setters that are fed a gluten free diet have been shown to be exempt from any effects associated with gluten intolerance.

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

<doc id="766934" wikidata="Q1378695" url="?curid=766934" title="Eustace (bishop of Ely)">
<text>Eustace (died February 1215) was the twenty-third Lord Chancellor of England, from 1197 to 1198. He was also Dean of Salisbury and Bishop of Ely.

==Early life==

Eustace was probably French or Norman by birth and was educated at Paris. He was a student with Gerald of Wales, who remained a lifelong friend. After his education was finished, he was considered a master, or magister. By 1177, he was a clerk for Robert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, and he stayed at Hereford until around 1186. By 1190, he held the office of parson of Withcall, Lincolnshire. He entered the king&#x27;s service sometime before 1194, for he was Dean of Salisbury by 5 May 1194. He held the offices of Archdeacon of Richmond, treasurer of the East Riding and archdeacon of the East Riding after this.

==Bishop==

Eustace was elected to the see of Ely on 10 August 1197 and consecrated on 8 March 1198. He had been elected at Vaudreuil, but King Richard I of England sent him on a diplomatic mission to Germany after his election, which kept him from being consecrated until 1198. The consecration was performed by Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster.

Eustace was Lord Chancellor from May 1198 to May 1199. During this time he also acted as a royal justice, and in January 1199, Richard sent him to King Philip II of France to notify the French king that the truce between Philip and Richard was over. With the death of King Richard and the accession of King John of England, Eustace was replaced as chancellor by Hubert Walter, but Eustace was still employed by the king on diplomatic errands, including two errands to the French king, in 1202 and 1204. It was at this time that Pope Innocent III began to use Eustace as a papal judge-delegate, first appointing him to help mediate a dispute between Hubert Walter and the monks of Canterbury.

Eustace was appointed one of the papal commissioners to investigate and settle the attempt by Savaric FitzGeldewin the Bishop of Wells to take over Glastonbury Abbey as Savaric&#x27;s new cathedral site. The commissioners set forth a plan, but Savaric died soon after and Pope Innocent III was persuaded to disallow the move. During King John&#x27;s dispute with the pope over the election of Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury, the pope once more chose Eustace as a commissioner in August 1207, along with William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, the Bishop of London, and Mauger the Bishop of Worcester. The commission tried to convince the king to accept Langton, but eventually in March 1208, they pronounced an interdict on England because of John&#x27;s refusal to accept Langton. In July 1208 the commissioners once more attempted to negotiate with John, this time in company with Langton&#x27;s brother Simon Langton. They waited eight weeks for a meeting, but the king never received them. A year later, the king finally met with them at Dover. Although an agreement was reached, it was never put into effect, and negotiations reached a stalemate. In November, the commissioners declared John excommunicated. Eustace had been in exile since the proclamation of the interdict in 1208. In 1212, Eustace journeyed to Rome to complain to Innocent about John&#x27;s oppression of the English Church.

==Later life and death==

When John made his peace with Innocent, Eustace was allowed to return to England, and it was Eustace who formally lifted the excommunication of John on 2 July 1214. John had pledged to compensate Eustace for the damages done to Ely during the interdict, which were estimated to have been around £1000. When John came into conflict with the barons, the king attempted to win over Eustace by giving Ely the royal rights of patronage to Thorney Abbey.

Eustace died at Reading on 3 February 1215 or on 4 February. He was buried in Ely Cathedral near the altar of St. Mary. A modern historian, C. R. Cheney, said of Eustace that even though he started as a royal official, he &quot;rose to [his] responsibilities&quot; as bishop. It was a letter of Eustace to Innocent that caused Innocent to write a letter back entitled &quot;Pastoralis officii diligentia&quot;, which later was incorporated into Gratian&#x27;s &quot;Decretals&quot;. Eustace was also active in promoting the canonization of Gilbert of Sempringham. He also investigated alleged miracles of Wulfstan of Worcester. He also built the church of St. Mary, in Ely.

<doc id="766937" wikidata="Q3341246" url="?curid=766937" title="Nidifugous and nidicolous organisms">
<text>In biology, nidifugous ( , ) organisms are those that leave the nest shortly after hatching or birth. The term is derived from Latin &quot;nidus&quot; for &quot;nest&quot; and &quot;fugere&quot;, meaning &quot;to flee&quot;. The terminology is most often used to describe birds and was introduced by Lorenz Oken in 1816. The chicks of birds in many families, such as the waterfowl, waders, and gamebirds, are usually nidifugous.

The opposite of nidifugous organisms are nidicolous ( ; from Latin &quot;nidus&quot; &quot;nest&quot; and &quot;-colus&quot; &quot;inhabiting&quot;) organisms; a nidicolous organism is one which stays at its birthplace for a long time because it depends on its parents for food, protection, and the learning of survival skills. Examples of nidicolous species include mammals and many species of birds. During the life span, the brain of a nidicolous animal expands 8–10 times its initial size; in nidifugous animals, it expands from 1.5 to 2.5 times.

==Relation to precociality and altriciality==
Two other terms are also used by scientists for related developmental phenomena: &quot;altricial&quot; (relatively undeveloped at birth or hatching; helpless, blind, without feathers or hair, and unable to fend for themselves) and &quot;precocial&quot; (relatively developed at birth or hatching; able to fend for themselves).

The term &quot;nidifugous&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;precocial&quot;, as all nidifugous species are precocial. Similarly, all altricial animals are nidicolous by necessity. 

However, not all precocial birds leave the nest; some may stay at the nest even if they are precocial and fully capable of leaving if needed. These species are thus considered nidicolous rather than nidifugous. Examples of precocious but nidicolous species include many gulls and terns.

<text>Tom Kilburn (11 August 1921 – 17 January 2001) was an English mathematician and computer scientist. Over his 30-year career, he was involved in the development of five computers of great historical significance. With Freddie Williams he worked on the Williams–Kilburn tube and the world&#x27;s first electronic stored-program computer, the Manchester Baby, while working at the University of Manchester. His work propelled Manchester and Britain into the forefront of the emerging field of computer science.

A graduate of the University of Cambridge, Kilburn worked on radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern supervised by Frederic Calland Williams during the Second World War. After the war ended, he was recruited by Williams to work on the development of computers at the University of Manchester. He led the development of a succession of innovative Manchester computers that incorporated a host of ground-breaking innovations and developments, including the Ferranti Mark 1, the world&#x27;s first commercial computer, and the Atlas, one of the first time-sharing multiprocessing computers that incorporated job scheduling, spooling, interrupts, instruction pipelining and paging.

==Early life and education==
Tom Kilburn was born in Earlseaton near Dewsbury, Yorkshire, on 11 August 1921, the only son of John William Kilburn, a wool mill clerk who later became a company secretary, and his wife, Ivy Mortimer. From 1932 to 1940, he attended the Wheelwright Grammar School for Boys, where the headmaster encouraged his aptitude for mathematics. He also played sports, notably running.

In 1940, Kilburn started studying mathematics at the University of Cambridge as a student Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, funded by a state scholarship, a county major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship. Although many university dons were absent performing war work at places like Bletchley Park, the University of Cambridge maintained an active mathematical community, and Kilburn became the Sidney Sussex College representative in the New Pythagoreans, a clique with the Cambridge University Mathematical Society whose members included Gordon Welchman and Geoff Tootill. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, courses were compressed to two years, and he graduated in 1942 with First Class Honours in Part I of the Mathematical Tripos and preliminary examinations for Part II.

==Career and research==
On graduation, Kilburn was recruited by C. P. Snow. He was given a quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging electronic circuitry. Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given someone with so little practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.

Kilburn&#x27;s wartime work inspired his enthusiasm for some form of electronic computer. The principal technical barrier to such a development at that time was the lack of any practical means of storage for data and instructions. In July 1946, Kilburn and Williams collaboratively developed a storage device based on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) called the Williams–Kilburn tube. A patent was filed in 1946. Initially they used it to store a single bit. The CRT image soon faded, so they devised a scheme by which it was read and refreshed continually, effectively making the data storage permanent. By December 1947, they were able to store 2,048 bits on one diameter CRT.

In December 1946, Williams took up the Edward Stocks Massey Chair of Electrotechnics at the University of Manchester, and recruited Kilburn on secondment from Malvern. The two developed their storage technology and, in 1948, Kilburn put it to a practical test in constructing the Manchester Baby, which became the first stored-program computer to run a program, on 21 June 1948. He received the degree of PhD in 1948 for his work at Manchester, writing his thesis on &quot;A storage system for use with binary digital computing machines&quot; under Williams&#x27;s supervision.

===Manchester computers===
Kilburn anticipated a return to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay to work on the university&#x27;s collaborative project developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world&#x27;s first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.
Over the next three decades, Kilburn led the development of a succession of innovative Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development of the Mark I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the vacuum tube diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It was also one of the first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti under the name &#x27;Mercury&#x27;, six of them to customers overseas.

While Kilburn led one design team working on Meg, he led another with Dick Grimsdale and Douglas Webb, on a research project examining what he believed would be the next step forward in computer design: the use of transistors. The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world&#x27;s first transistor computer, with 550 diodes and 92 transistors, and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 transistors, and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.

Kilburn&#x27;s next project, known as Atlas, aimed to create a fast computer by making maximum use of existing and new technologies. The project was backed by Ferranti and a £300,000 grant from the National Research Development Corporation. It incorporated numerous technologies and techniques such as &quot;multiprogramming, job scheduling, spooling, interrupts, pipelining, interleaved storage, autonomous transfer units, virtual storage and paging – though none of these techniques had been invented when the project started in 1956.&quot; Other innovations included read only memory and a compiler-compiler. The greatest innovation was virtual memory, which allowed the drum storage to be treated as if it were core. Three of them were built, and installed at Manchester University, the University of London and the Rutherford Laboratory.
Kilburn became a professor of computing engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Manchester in 1960. He was instrumental in forming the Department of Computer Science in 1964, becoming the first head of the department, and served as Dean of the Faculty of Science from 1970 to 1972, and pro-vice-chancellor of the university from 1976 to 1979. His final computer project was the MU5, which was designed to facilitate the running of programs in high-level programming languages. An analysis of code written for the Atlas gave an insight into the frequency of different operands and control structures. The project was assisted by a £630,000 Science Research Council (SRC) grant awarded over five-years. The design heavily influenced the successful ICL 2900 Series.

===Awards and honours===
Over the years, Kilburn received numerous awards and accolades. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965, a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1974 and a fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his contributions to early computer design including random access digital storage, virtual memory and multiprogramming&quot; in 2000. He was created a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1973, and was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Bath in 1979.
Kilburn received the IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award in 1971 &quot;for his achievement in designing and building some of the first – as well as some of the most powerful – computers in the world&quot;, the British Computer Society IT Award in 1973, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, in 1978, the IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award in 1982, the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 1983, and the Mountbatten Medal. 1997. A building at the University of Manchester, which houses the Department of Computer Science, is named &quot;The Kilburn Building&quot; in his honour. His nomination for the Royal Society reads: 

==Personal life==
Kilburn married Irene Marsden in 1943 and had two children, one daughter and one son. Kilburn habitually holidayed with his family in Blackpool but was always back in time for Manchester United F.C.&#x27;s first match of the football season. He claimed that watching Manchester United win the 1968 European Cup Final at Wembley stadium was the best day of his life. He took early retirement in 1981 to care for his ailing wife, who was suffering from chronic bronchitis, but she died on 3 August 1981, two weeks before his retirement.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Kilburn lived alone in the modest house they had shared in Manchester. He did not own a personal computer. In 1998 he unveiled a fully functional replica of the Manchester Baby at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. He died at Trafford General Hospital in Davyhulme of pneumonia following abdominal surgery on 17 January 2001.

<text>John O&#x27;Quinn Field at Corbin J. Robertson Stadium (often referred to as simply Robertson Stadium) was a multi-purpose stadium in Houston, located on the campus of the University of Houston. It was the home of the Houston Cougars football and women&#x27;s soccer teams. The stadium was the first home for the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer from 2006 to 2011, as well as the first home of the American Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers from 1960 to 1964.

On January 1, 1961, it hosted the American Football League Championship Game (for the 1960 title). The Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Chargers (24–16) to become the league&#x27;s first champions. It was also the site for pro football&#x27;s first ever double-overtime game on December 23, 1962. The Oilers lost to the Dallas Texans (20–17) in that year&#x27;s AFL title game. This was the only overtime game in the 10-year history of the AFL.

The stadium&#x27;s capacity was 32,000. The stadium&#x27;s record attendance in its final configuration was set at 32,413, when Houston hosted the 2011 Conference USA Championship Game on December 3.

In June 2010, the University of Houston announced its intention to raze Robertson Stadium, and build a new stadium at the same site. The stadium was closed and demolished upon the conclusion of the Houston Cougars&#x27; 2012 football season. The replacement venue is TDECU Stadium.

==History==

===Planning and construction===

Houston Independent School District (HISD) had purchased West End Park from the Houston Buffaloes when they moved into Buffalo Stadium in 1928. The ballpark, which was also used for football and other athletic events, had originally been constructed in 1904, and was in need of replacement. It was because of this that a larger, modern venue began being planned by school board officials.

Prior to the construction of Robertson Stadium, the University of Houston campus had been built nearby in 1939. In March 1940 the HISD, who were in control of the university at the time, purchased the undeveloped site for a stadium from the Settegast Estate for $75,550.16. Another was acquired soon thereafter to bring the original site total to . The area of land is now bound by Holman Street, Wheeler Street, Scott Street, and Cullen Boulevard.

The stadium was then constructed as a joint project between HISD and the Works Progress Administration by the Fretz Construction Company. Named the &quot;Public School Stadium&quot;, it was completed in 1942, and had a seating capacity of 14,500. Public School Fieldhouse (later known as Jeppesen Gymnasium), a multi-purpose indoor arena which was constructed simultaneously, stood alongside. The stadium&#x27;s first game was held before a crowd of 14,500 on September 18, 1942, when Houston&#x27;s Lamar High School defeated Dallas&#x27; W. H. Adamson High School 26–7.

===Early years===
HISD football games continued to be played at the stadium when the Houston Cougars football team played their inaugural game in front of a crowd of 11,000 with Southwestern Louisiana (now known as Louisiana). The University of Houston continued to host home football games there from 1946 to 1950 before moving to Houston Stadium in 1951 and then to the Astrodome in 1965. Prior to the 1957 football season, HISD changed policy at the stadium to disallow any teams with black students to play there despite this being previously allowed without issue. In 1958, the school district renamed the stadium &quot;Jeppesen Stadium&quot; for school board member Holger Jeppesen, who had vigorously lobbied for its construction.
In 1960, the Houston Oilers began play as a charter member of the American Football League, and arranged to lease the stadium from HISD as their home stadium. The team was owned by Bud Adams, a wealthy Houston oilman who upgraded Jeppesen Stadium for professional football use. Part of Adams&#x27; upgrades were expanding the seating capacity to 36,000. This allowed for the largest attendance for the stadium ever of 37,981 when the Dallas Texans competed against the Oilers on December 23, 1962 for that year&#x27;s AFL title game. At this time HISD continued its use of the stadium with an average of ten games per week. Making national headlines, the NAACP protested HISD&#x27;s segregation policy in 1961, and formally asked players from the Oakland Raiders to refuse to play the Houston Oilers at Jeppesen Stadium in a regular-season game. The Oilers remained at Jeppesen until 1964, when they moved into Rice Stadium.

In 1966, the University of Houston developed a master plan that emphasized the acquisition of the stadium.

===Renovations and regular use===
Corbin J. Robertson, former UH Board of Regents member and Athletics Committee Chairman, funded its renovation in 1970, and the stadium was bought for US$6.8 million by the University of Houston. In 1980, it was renamed &quot;Robertson Stadium&quot; in his honor.
Beginning with the 1994 season, the Houston Cougars football team began splitting their home schedule with the Astrodome and Robertson Stadium. The University of Houston ended its lease agreement to hold home football games at the Astrodome before the 1998 season, moving the entire home slate of games back to Robertson Stadium on campus for the first time since 1949. In 1996, adjacent Jeppesen Gymnasium, in need of heavy renovations, was demolished to make way for a new scoreboard. The stadium was heavily renovated in 1999 to bring it up to NCAA Division I-A (now Division I FBS) standards for football venues. The playing surface was lowered nine feet and the running track eliminated to facilitate the addition of new seating on the sidelines and end zones. A total of twenty luxury suites were also constructed above both sides of the stadium. The playing field itself was named in honor of Houston attorney John O&#x27;Quinn, a donor to the project, thus modifying its official name to &quot;John O&#x27;Quinn Field at Robertson Stadium&quot;. Rodney Griffin was the first official groundskeeper of the facility.
On August 2, 2002, the NFL&#x27;s Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys competed against each other in a scrimmage at Robertson Stadium. It was the first public game for the Texans, which were an expansion team to the league.

Several improvements were made in 2006 thanks in part to a $1.7 million donation from the Houston Dynamo. The lighting system was upgraded and a new scoreboard and a Philips Vidiwall video screen was added. This was completed in August 2006. The Dynamo used the stadium for its first six seasons, leaving after 2011 for a new soccer-specific stadium in downtown Houston, BBVA Compass Stadium.

With its final seating, the largest attendance for a single game at Robertson Stadium was set at 32,413, when Houston was defeated by Southern Miss on December 3, 2011 in the 2011 C-USA Championship Game in Houston. Prior to this, it was 32,207 when Houston defeated SMU on November 19, 2011. It was also the first time ESPN came to Houston to host &quot;College GameDay&quot;.

===Demolition===
The university hired the architecture firm of Leo A. Daly to assess the stadium and develop a plan for the long-term improvement of the facility. Plans were proposed to replace the end zone sections with an integrated bowl and add an upper deck that would increase capacity to 50,000, but with the athletic department changing leadership from Dave Maggard to Mack Rhoades, a new feasibility study was conducted instead. This study, conducted by AECOM for four months, was concluded in June 2010 with an announcement by the university to raze Robertson Stadium, and rebuild a new stadium at the location. On February 1, 2012, Athletic Director Mack Rhoades announced that demolition work would begin at the conclusion of the 2012 season. Robertson Stadium hosted its final event, the Cougars&#x27; season finale against Tulane, on November 24. The Cougars defeated the Green Wave 40-17 to finish their run at Robertson with a final record of 72-44-1. Official demolition of the stadium began on December 2, 2012, and major demolition began on December 10, 2012. Demolition continued through the end of 2012 when the last remaining structures were taken down and all major demolition/cleanup activities were completed by the end of January 2013. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new stadium took place in early February, 2013.

==Events hosted==
===Football===
Prior to its demolition, Robertson Stadium had hosted many football games. The 1960 AFL Championship game and 1962 AFL Championship game were played at Robertson Stadium by the Oilers against the Los Angeles Chargers and Dallas Texans respectively. On January 16, 1965, the 1964 AFL All-Star game was also held there. On December 1, 2006, the stadium was host to the Conference USA Football Championship. On March 8, 2008, the stadium hosted the inaugural Space City Classic, a Houston-area high school all-star game. In January 2008 and 2009, the 83rd and 84th annual East–West Shrine Games were played at Robertson Stadium.

===Other Sports===
The stadium hosted a variety of other sports events. The 1983 NCAA Track &amp; Field Championship was held at Robertson Stadium prior to the removal of the track. On November 10, 2007, the Dynamo defeated the Kansas City Wizards in the 2007 MLS Western Conference final. The stadium also hosted international rugby games, with 13,000 fans turning out in December 2001 to watch the USA play South Africa.

===Concerts===
Robertson Stadium was the venue for several concerts. In 1972, ZZ Top, The Doobie Brothers, Wishbone Ash, &amp; Willie Nelson performed at Robertson Stadium. In June 1974 Jesse Colin Young and The Beach Boys opened for Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young and in July of the same year, Commander Cody &amp; His Lost Planet Airmen and The Eagles opened for The Allman Brothers. Other concerts held at the stadium include The Eagles with Jimmy Buffett as warm up in 1977, Pink Floyd during their In The Flesh Tour, and Alice Cooper in 1980.

==Transportation==
Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) operates the METRORail Purple Line Robertson Stadium/UH/TSU station, which served Robertson Stadium and now serves TDECU Stadium.

<text>Višnjan () is a village and municipality in Istria, Croatia. Višnjan is the site of Višnjan Observatory (an astronomical observatory). The observatory is home of several long-running international summer programs for youth in astronomy, archeology, marine biology and other disciplines.

==Geography==
Višnjan is located 12 kilometers east of Poreč and 3 kilometers west of Pula-Koper road. Višnjan is located on elevation of 244m and average municipality elevation is between 200-300m. One of the most notable sinkholes in Istria, Baredina, is located in the municipality.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, its population was 2,096 with 664 living in the town proper.

According to the 2001 census Višnjan had a population of 625 with a total municipal population of 2,187 of which 71.7% were Croats, 9.1% were Italians and 6.2% declared themselves as Istrians. Like most settlements in Istrian interior Višnjan is experiencing depopulation in the last decades as people are migrating towards the coast.

According to the 1921 census the majority of the population was italian.

==History==

In the village of Strpačići, 1 km from Višnjan copper earrings and needles were found. Illyrians came to the region somewhere between 2000 and 1000 BC and were later replaced by Celts. The remains of the Celtic era can be found on the nearby Montemez hill which is Celtic for nice hill. Remnants of pottery can be found all over the area as well in the town itself. A few kilometers west from Višnjan there is a prehistoric and medieval settlement called Dilian with a monastery and church named Saint Mihovil dating from the 11th century. Višnjan was first mentioned in a document from 1003 AD. Višnjan was surrounded by a defense wall until the 18th century. The City was entered through a gate crowned with a Venetian lion and an open book. Višnjan was part of the Motovun municipality until 1847 when it became an independent municipality. It was subsequently incorporated into Poreč municipality in 1947. In 1976 an astronomical observatory was built in Višnjan and the town became the astronomy centre of Yugoslavia. In 1993 Višnjan again became an independent municipality.

Višnjan is partially surrounded by walls built in the 13th and 14th centuries, and in the town there is a Gothic church of St. Anton from the 15th century and the church of St. Quirik and Julita from the 19th century. 

==Economy==

Most of Višnjan&#x27;s economy comes from agriculture mostly olive growing and viticulture. Višnjan is also known as one of the last resorts in Istria of autochthon Istrian bovine &quot;Boškarin&quot;. &quot;Boškarin&quot;, the first geno-park in Croatia, was founded With the intention of preserving Boškarin in Višnjan . Most of the people work on the coast and travel daily to work.

<text>The South Umpqua River is a tributary of the Umpqua River, approximately long, in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains part of the Cascade Range east of Roseburg. The river passes through a remote canyon in its upper reaches then emerges in the populated South Umpqua Valley east of Canyonville.

==Course==

It rises in the high Cascades north of Fish Mountain, formed by the confluence of two short forks in eastern Douglas County approximately northwest of Crater Lake. It flows generally southwest through a remote canyon in the Umpqua National Forest to Tiller, then west past Milo and Days Creek. It emerges into the South Umpqua Valley at Canyonville, passing under Interstate 5 and flowing north along the highway past Tri-City, Myrtle Creek, and Roseburg. It joins the North Umpqua from the south to form the Umpqua approximately northwest of Roseburg.

It receives Cow Creek from the south approximately southwest of Tri-City.

One of the main tributaries of the South Umpqua River is Cow Creek, which also flows west from the Cascade Mountains, but South of Canyonville. On its westward journey, the Cow Creek more or less runs parallel to the South Umpqua River, with an east–west mountain ridge separating them.

Cow Creek runs further west, swings around north and makes its confluence with the South Umpqua River at Tri City. The Cow Creek has such a significant flow that it is almost a toss-up as to which should be called the river and which the creek.

==History==

For centuries the South Umpqua River and Cow Creek were the homelands for the Umpqua Indians. However, gold was discovered on the South Umpqua River in 1848 causing an influx of gold miners and the homesteaders found the rich agricultural land of the area desirable.

In 1853 a treaty was negotiated between Joel Palmer, Superintendent of Indians, representing the Government of the United States and Chief Quintioosan and others, representing the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua people. Although the US Government ratified the treaty, the terms agreed upon in the treaty were never honored.

Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and traders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company began using the South Umpqua River valley to move along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail. The Siskiyou Trail was based on existing Indian footpaths, and became an important link between the Pacific Northwest and California&#x27;s Central Valley.

In 1846, spurred by the desire to create a safer trail for emigrants to use to reach the Willamette Valley, Jesse and Lindsay Applegate, Levi Scott, and 13 other companions explored a new route through the valley that connected the southern Willamette Valley with Goose Lake in Northern California. This trail became known as the Applegate Trail, and linked up with the northernmost branch of the California Trail.

Interstate 5 closely follows the original Siskiyou Trail route through the valley today.

==Economic importance==

The South Umpqua River valley became an important timber-producing region in the 20th century. In the 21st century, tourism became important to the South Umpqua Valley.

The Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians received a land claims settlement from the US federal government in 1988.

Using the land claims settlement of $1.5 million, the Cow Creek Band operates a casino, hotel, convention center, and other businesses in Canyonville on the South Umpqua River.

South Umpqua Falls near Tiller is the site of a popular picnic area and United States Forest Service campground near the river. Open from May 1 to October 31, the campground has 16 sites suitable for tents or trailers.

<text>The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse is a poetry anthology edited by Philip Larkin. It was published in 1973 by Oxford University Press with . Larkin writes in the short preface that the selection is wide rather than deep; and also notes that for the post-1914 period it is more a collection of poems, than of poets. The remit was limited by him to poets with a period of residence in the British Isles. Larkin&#x27;s generous selection of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poems has been noted for its influence on Hardy&#x27;s later reputation. On the other hand, he was criticized, notably by Donald Davie, for his inclusion of &quot;pop&quot; poets such as Brian Patten. The volume contains works by 207 poets.

<text>Parallel parking is a method of parking a vehicle parallel to the road, in line with other parked vehicles. Parallel parking usually requires initially driving slightly past the parking space, parallel to the parked vehicle in front of that space, keeping a safe distance, then followed by reversing into that space. Subsequent position adjustment may require the use of forward and reverse gears.

==Techniques==
Parallel parking is considered to be one of the most stressful and difficult skills for new drivers to learn. While parallel parking is a required part of most driving tests, several states in the US have dropped it as a requirement.

Parallel parking enables the driver to park a vehicle in a smaller space than would be true of forward parking. Driving forward into a parking space on the side of a road is typically not possible unless two or more successive parking spaces are empty. Reversing into the spot via the parallel parking technique allows one to take advantage of a single empty space not much longer than the car (in order to complete the parking within three wheel-turns the parking space would generally need to be about one and a half car-length long).

New drivers learn to use reference points to align themselves in relation to the car in front of the space, to determine the proper angle for backing, and to determine when to turn the steering wheel while backing. They may find it easier to briefly stop at each reference point and turn for the next step.

==Steps==
Two major types of parallel parking technique differ in whether they will use two or three positions of the steering wheel while backing. A skilled driver is theoretically able to parallel park by having their car move along two arcs, the first having its center on the parking side of the car and the second having its center on the other side. There will be a point in the transition between these curves where all the car&#x27;s wheels will be parallel with each other. Less-confident drivers may choose to drive further while transitioning, making it a pronounced middle step of three. Such a step allows greater tolerances to avoid hitting anything, but forces the car to start further from the road&#x27;s edge and requires more space to the rear.

==Computer Assisted Parallel Parking==

Beginning in the early 2000s, automobile manufacturers began providing computer assisted automatic parking software on some models that allowed drivers to engage the software to complete the parallel parking maneuver hands-free. Depending on the system, the automatic parking feature controls the steering while the driver operates the accelerator and brakes, or the software handles both steering and accelerator.

==Legality==
In Japan, there is a ban on on-street parking, with a few exceptions (such as daytime and evening parking). In addition to this, there is a proof-of-parking rule and motorists are required to present a garage certificate (&quot;Shako shomei sho&quot;) to prove that they have a garage before being allowed to register a car.

==History==
In the 1930s cars were developed with a fifth wheel, in between the two rear wheels and perpendicular to them, which could be lowered to the ground and used to drive sideways into a parallel parking spot. This innovation was intended to make parallel parking much easier, but it never became popular.

<doc id="766949" wikidata="Q355296" url="?curid=766949" title="Mel Sheppard">
<text>Melvin Whinfield &quot;Peerless Mel&quot; Sheppard (September 5, 1883 – January 4, 1942) was an American athlete, member of the Irish American Athletic Club, and winner of four gold medals and one silver medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics and 1912 Summer Olympics. Along with Henry Taylor of the United Kingdom, he was the most successful athlete at the 1908 Olympics.

==Early life==
Born in the Almonesson section of Deptford Township, New Jersey, Sheppard moved Almonesson to Clayton, New Jersey at age nine, where he worked in a glass factory before moving to Haddonfield, New Jersey and then the Grays Ferry neighborhood of Philadelphia in his mid-teens.

===Track career===
Sheppard, or &quot;Peerless Mel&quot; as he was nicknamed, was rejected by the New York Police because he had a slightly enlarged heart. Cardiopulmonary problems notwithstanding, Sheppard won three consecutive AAU titles in the 880 yards (805 m) from 1906 to 1908 and became a main favorite for the middle distance events at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. By late 1907, Sheppard held world indoor records for 600 yards, 880 yards, 1000 yards, and the mile.

During the indoor season of 1907–08, Sheppard raced Guy Haskins In the first, he was beaten. In the second, about to be beaten again, he threw Haskins to the floor with a flying mare, which he also did to another runner, Adam O&#x27;Shea, in the Millrose Games in which he was disqualified. In the third, he walked off the track as he was about to be beaten again. By May the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Haskins, &quot;unquestionably the best half-mile and mile performer in the country&quot;, had been refused selection for the United States team to the 1908 Olympics for which he had been trying. He was not selected for the Australasian team either, largely for financial reasons.

==1908 Olympic Games==

The 1908 Olympics were the first true championships for the 1500 metres. In the finals, only the winner of each of the eight heats would qualify for the final, and there was no seeding to ensure that top runners were separated in their heats. Top runners like 1904, 1906 Olympic champion James Lightbody, John Halstead, second-fastest in history in the event, and three-time AAA champion George Butterfield all failed to advance.

Sheppard won the 1500 metres, setting an Olympic record at 4:05.0 in the first round that fell in the very next heat, when Norman Hallows ran a 4:03.6. Sheppard matched Hallows&#x27; time in the final the next day to win the first running gold medal awarded at the 1908 Games.

In the 800 metres, Sheppard won his first round with a time of 1:58.0; James Lintott remained close throughout the race and threatened to eliminate Sheppard from the competition. Sheppard ran the first 400 metres of the 800 metres final in 53 seconds and went on to win in the world record time of 1.52.8.

He earned his third gold medal on the medley relay race. He was the final runner on the American team, running half of the 1600 metre race. He was passed the baton by fellow Irish American Athletic Club member John Baxter Taylor, Jr., who would become the first African American to win an Olympic gold medal. Even without being in as good of form as he had been in the individual races, Sheppard had little trouble retaining the leads giving to him teammates William Hamilton, Nate Cartmell, and John Taylor. The team won both the first round and final in times of 3:27.2 and 3:29.4. Sheppard&#x27;s 800 metre split for the final was 1:55.4.

==One-Mile Relay world record==
At the Amateur Athletic Union metropolitan championships held at Travers Island in 1909, Sheppard was part of the Irish American Athletic Club&#x27;s four-man relay team that broke the world&#x27;s record for the one mile relay with a time of 3 minutes 20 2/5 seconds. The other three men on the record breaking team were: C.S. Cassara, William Robbins, and James Rosenberger. His 1910 trading card called him &quot;undoubtedly the greatest mid-distance runner the world has ever seen.&quot;

==1912 Olympic Games==

After winning Amateur Athletic Union titles at in 1911 and 1912, Sheppard was a favorite to defend his Olympic 800 metres title at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. At Stockholm, he tried the same tactics as in London, but after an opening lap of 52.4 he was overtaken by teammate Ted Meredith, who set a new world record of 1.51.9. Sheppard won his fourth gold medal as lead-off runner on the 4×400 metre relay team that set a world record of 3:16.6.

==Post-competition career==
Sheppard was a member of the New Jersey National Guard and the 69th Regiment. During World War I, he served as an athletic director at a number of military training camps. After the war, he coached for a number of amateur athletic clubs. Sheppard worked for John Wanamaker and was the recreational director for the Millrose Athletic Association, which was formed by Wanamaker&#x27;s employees. Sheppard coached the U.S. women&#x27;s track and field team at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.

==Death==
Sheppard died at his home in Bayside, Queens in New York City. He was interred in New Camden Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary cites &quot;acute indigestion&quot; as the cause of death. He was survived by his wife Estelle (née) Symon, his daughter Adelaide Kohler of Wildwood, New Jersey and his son Melvin Sheppard Jr., who was on Princeton University&#x27;s track and cross country teams in 1932.

==Legacy==
While it is claimed that &quot;after retiring from sports Sheppard became a lawyer (he was one of the defenders of the Lindbergh child kidnapper Bruno Hauptmann),&quot; this is an Internet myth. The lead attorney for Bruno Hauptmann was a Edward J. Reilly. &quot;The Trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann,&quot; by Sidney B. Whipple, originally published by Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., NY, 1937, makes no mention of Sheppard. Whipple lists the defense team present for the first day of trial as &quot;Mr. Reilly, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Pope, Mr. Rosecrans.&quot; There is no evidence that Sheppard ever practiced law, or had anything to do with the Lindbergh child kidnapper.

<text>Videogrammetry is a measurement technology in which the three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object are determined by measurements made in two or more video images taken from different angles. Images can be obtained from two cameras which simultaneously view the object or from successive images captured by the same camera with a view of the object. Videogrammetry is typically used in manufacturing and construction.

Kaptur was born on June 17, 1946, in Toledo, Ohio, the daughter of Anastasia Delores (Rogowski) and Stephen Jacob Kaptur. Her parents were both of Polish descent. Her mother was an automobile union organizer and her family operated a small grocery. Kaptur started volunteering with the Ohio Democratic Party when she was 13.

Kaptur graduated from St. Ursula Academy in 1964 and became the first person in her family to attend college. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1968 and a Master of Urban Planning from the University of Michigan in 1974. She began doctoral studies in urban planning development finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981.

==Early career==
Kaptur served on the Toledo-Lucas County Plan Commissions from 1969 to 1975. She was director of planning for the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs from 1975 to 1977, founded by Geno Baroni. She later served as a domestic policy advisor during President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

While at MIT, Kaptur was recruited to run for Congress in 1982 against freshman Republican Ed Weber, who had upset 26-year incumbent Lud Ashley two years earlier. Despite being outspent by almost 3–1, she defeated Weber 58–39%.

In 1984, Kaptur faced a strong challenge from Republican Frank Venner, longtime anchorman and weatherman at WTVG, but defeated him 55–44%, even as Ronald Reagan carried the district. From 1986 to 2002, she won every election with at least 74% of the vote. Since 2016 Kaptur has faced increasingly strong challengers with her winning 56.6% of the vote against challenger J.R. Majewski in 2022.

==== 2006 ====
Kaptur won her 13th term with 74% of the vote.

==== 2008 ====
Kaptur won her 14th term with 74% of the vote.

==== 2010 ====
Shortly after achieving fame during the 2008 election, conservative figure Samuel &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; Wurzelbacher announced that he was considering challenging Kaptur in the 2010 election,
but chose not to run. Kaptur was instead challenged by Republican Rich Iott, a Tea Party movement favorite. She was reelected to a 15th term with 59% of the vote, her closest victory since 1984.

==== 2012 ====

For her first three decades in Congress, Kaptur represented a compact district centered around Toledo. Redistricting after the 2010 census extended the 9th district to western Cleveland. The new map put the home of incumbent 10th district congressman Dennis Kucinich into the 9th, so they ran against each other in the Democratic primary. Graham Veysey, a small-business owner from Cleveland, also ran in the primary. Retaining over 60% of her former territory, Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote to Kucinich&#x27;s 40%. In the general election, she won a 16th term against Wurzelbacher and Libertarian Sean Stipe. The reconfigured 9th was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Kaptur had effectively clinched reelection by defeating Kucinich in the primary.

==== 2014 ====

Kaptur&#x27;s 2014 opponent was Richard May, a longtime Republican activist from west Cleveland, who beat Lakewood resident Robert C. Horrocks Jr. in the May 6 primary. Kaptur won 68–32%.

==== 2016 ====
Kaptur&#x27;s 2016 opponent was Donald Larson, who defeated Steven Kraus and Joel Lieske in the Republican primary on March 15. Kaptur won 68–31%.

==== 2020 ====
Kaptur&#x27;s 2020 opponent was Rob Weber, who defeated Charles W. Barrett, Tim Connors, and Timothy P. Corrigan in the Republican primary on March 17. Kaptur won 63–37%.

==== 2022 ====

Kaptur was seemingly placed in a vulnerable position when redistricting shifted her district to the west in order to take in territory previously in the neighboring heavily Republican . While Joe Biden carried the old 9th with 59% of the vote, the new 9th would have voted for Donald Trump with 51% of the vote. Despite this, Kaptur easily defeated Republican nominee J.R. Majewski, 56.6% to 43.4%.

==== 2024 ====

Kaptur won an extremely close race against Derek Merrin, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump. At 48.3% to Merrin&#x27;s 47.6%, this was the first race in which Kaptur did not receive a majority of the votes cast.

===Tenure===
In 1996, Ross Perot asked Kaptur to be his vice-presidential running mate. She declined.

In 2016, Kaptur endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, and introduced him at a rally in Toledo. In October, she endorsed the nominee, Hillary Clinton, who had won Ohio and her district in the primary, at a rally in Toledo.

==== World War II memorial ====
In 1987, Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act in the House. The bill authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission to establish a World War II memorial. It was not voted on before the end of the session and so failed to be enacted. Kaptur introduced similar legislation twice in 1989 but these bills also failed to become law.

Kaptur introduced legislation for the fourth time in 1993. This time the legislation was voted on and passed in the House. After a companion bill was passed in the United States Senate, President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law.

Kaptur later said that she felt &quot;a great sense of fulfillment&quot; that the memorial was built. &quot;This generation was the most unselfish America has ever seen,&quot; she said. &quot;They never asked anybody for anything in return.&quot;

==== 2008 economic crisis ====
Kaptur opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided a bailout for U.S. banks. Her opposition to the bailout was highlighted in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;&quot;.

In 2011, Kaptur introduced H.R. 1489 to restore the Glass–Steagall Act, &quot;To repeal certain provisions of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act and revive the separation between commercial banking and the securities business, in the manner provided in the Banking Act of 1933, the so-called &#x27;Glass–Steagall Act&#x27;, and for other purposes.&quot; There were 30 co-sponsors.

===Committee assignments===

* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development (Ranking member)
** Subcommittee on Defense

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional Ukrainian Caucus (co-chair)
* Congressional Caucus on Poland
*Climate Solutions Caucus
*Blue Collar Caucus

== Political positions ==

=== Free trade ===

Kaptur opposes free trade agreements. She helped lead opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, permanent normal trade relations for the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and fast track authority for the president.

=== Patent reform ===
Kaptur opposed the America Invents Act that passed into law and changed the U.S. Patent System. She opposed changing from a &quot;first to invent system&quot; to a &quot;first to file system&quot;, saying it hurt small businesses and &quot;Our patent system is the finest in the world... the proposed solutions are special fixes that benefit these few giants at the expense of everyone else.&quot;

Kaptur co-sponsored the Restoring America&#x27;s Leadership in Innovation Act. In order to strengthen inventors&#x27; property rights, the bill would remove the administrative review process that allows the public to challenge patent filings&#x27; validity; the process exists to prevent misuse of the patent system.

=== Gun control ===
Kaptur voted for H.R. 1808: Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. The legislation would ban semiautomatic rifles, including AR-15s, the most popular rifles in the U.S.

=== Foreign affairs ===

Kaptur co-chairs the Ukrainian Caucus. She has been a vocal supporter of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kaptur has said Ukraine &quot;voted for her own independence and has been laboring to be free with continued Russian meddling in her country all these decades.&quot; Kaptur signed a letter in 2023 advocating for President Biden to give F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.

Kaptur voted in 2023 against H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

=== Immigration reform ===
Kaptur was one of 38 Democrats to vote against the DREAM Act in 2010. It passed the House but failed in the Senate. She voted for the DREAM Act in 2021.

Kaptur voted against the Equal Representation Act in 2024. This proposed law would have required that when counting the population of each state to determine the number of U.S. Representatives, noncitizens who are ineligible to vote would be excluded from the count.

In January of 2025, Kaptur was one of 46 House Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

In February of 2025, Kaptur raised concerns about Elon Musk&#x27;s U.S. citizenship status, questioning his allegiance due to his multiple nationalities. Speaking outside the Capitol, Kaptur remarked, &quot;Mr. Musk has just been here 22 years. And he’s a citizen of three countries. I always ask myself the question, with the damage he’s doing here, when push comes to shove, which country is his loyalty to? South Africa? Canada? Or the United States? And he’s only been a citizen, I’ll say again, 22 years.&quot; Kaptur’s remarks quickly drew backlash on social media, with many users criticizing them as nativist rhetoric.

=== Abortion ===
Kaptur holds a 95% rating from NARAL. She supported &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;the law of the land&quot;. She has voted for some proposals to restrict access to abortion and opposed others. In 2007, she was the only member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to vote against federally funded embryonic stem-cell research. Kaptur voted for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009. She was one of only 16 Democrats to vote for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act on May 4, 2011. Kaptur also voted to ban partial-birth abortions in 2000 and 2003. She voted against the Child Custody Protection Act in 1999 and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2005. Kaptur voted against allowing privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals twice in 1995, as well as in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2005, Kaptur voted to lift the ban on abortions at overseas military hospitals.

In 2023, Kaptur voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have criminalized failing to provide care for an infant born alive after an abortion attempt.

==Personal life==
Kaptur is a Roman Catholic. In her letter to NETWORK Lobby, she wrote: &quot;The Roman Catholic faith is a central pillar of my being, particularly as an American of Polish heritage&quot;. She describes her Catholicism as an element of her Polish heritage, stating that the Catholic Church gave her &quot;ancestors worth and hope—during times of bondage, repression, punishment, war, illness, and harrowing economic downturns&quot;. Kaptur also expressed her admiration for Catholic social teaching, especially the option for the poor. In 2010, Kaptur withheld her vote on Affordable Care Act until being assured that it would not fund abortion. 

Because she mixes political Catholicism with her progressive persona, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described her as &quot;an economic populist from America’s heartland with progressive values and a conservative disposition&quot;.

<doc id="766960" wikidata="Q1489399" url="?curid=766960" title="Hy-Vee Arena">
<text>Hy-Vee Arena, previously known as Kemper Arena, is an indoor arena located in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to conversion to a youth sports and community gymnasium facility, Kemper Arena was previously a 19,500-seat professional sports arena. It has hosted NCAA Final Four basketball games, professional basketball and hockey teams, professional wrestling events, the 1976 Republican National Convention, concerts, and is the ongoing host of the American Royal livestock show.

It was originally named for Rufus Crosby Kemper Sr., a member of the powerful Kemper financial clan and who donated $3.2 million from his estate for the arena. In 2016, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its revolutionary design by Helmut Jahn.

==History==

===Construction===

Kemper Arena was built in 18 months in 1973–74 on the site of the former Kansas City Stockyards just west of downtown in the West Bottoms to replace the 8,000-seat Municipal Auditorium to play host to the city&#x27;s professional basketball and hockey teams.

The arena was the first major project of German architect Helmut Jahn, who was to go on to become an important architect of his era.

The building was revolutionary in its simplicity and the fact it did not have interior columns obstructing views. Its roof is suspended by exterior steel trusses. The nearly windowless structure contrasts to Jahn&#x27;s later signature style of providing wide-open, glass-enclosed spaces. Kemper&#x27;s exterior skeleton style was to be used extensively throughout Jahn&#x27;s other projects.

The building cost $22 million and was previously owned by the city of Kansas City, Missouri. Financing came from seven sources:
*$5.6 million from general obligation bonds
*$3.2 million donated by Rufus Crosby Kemper Sr.
*$575,000 from bond interest
*$1.5 million donated by the American Royal Association
*Land provided by the Kansas City Stockyards Company
*$10 million from revenue bonds in conjunction with the Jackson County Sports Authority
*$2 million in federal grants for street work

===1970s===
The arena won architectural awards in the 1970s and had these notable tenants:
*1974–1976 – Kansas City Scouts of the NHL
*1974–1985 – Kansas City Kings of the NBA
*1976 Republican National Convention (where President Gerald R. Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the nomination)
* June 18, 1977 Elvis Presley, played to a sold-out arena, only two months prior to his death at age 42.

===1979 roof collapse===
On June 4, 1979, at 6:45 p.m., a major storm with winds and heavy rains caused a portion of Kemper Arena&#x27;s roof to collapse. Since the Arena was not in use at the time, no one was injured.

The American Institute of Architects had given the building an &quot;Honor&quot; award in 1976 and the AIA, coincidentally, was holding its annual national conference in Kansas City half a mile away at nearby Bartle Hall. The last event in the arena had been a Memorial Day concert by the Village People a week earlier. Further, the collapse coupled with the 1978 collapse of the Hartford Civic Center under heavy snow prompted architects to seriously reconsider computer models used to determine the safety of arenas.

The arena was one of the first major projects by influential architect Helmut Jahn who was to take over the Murphy/Jahn firm founded by Charles Murphy. Steel trusses that hung from three huge portals supported the reinforced concrete roof. Design elements had called for compensating for winds that caused the roof to swing like a pendulum. The exterior skeleton design had been considered revolutionary in its simplicity (it was built in 18 months).

Two major factors contributed to the collapse.
First, the roof had been designed to gradually release rainwater to avoid overloading sewers. This caused water to pond (where water fills in as the roof sagged), adding to the weight.
Second, there had been a miscalculation on the strength of the bolts on the hangers when subjected to the winds while supporting the additional rainwater weight as the roof swung back and forth. Once one of the bolts gave way there was a cascading failure on the south side of the roof.

Approximately one acre, or × of roof collapsed. The air pressure, increased by the rapidly falling roof caused some of the walls to blow out. However, the portals remained undamaged.

An investigation was conducted, the issues were addressed, and the arena reopened within a year.

===College basketball mecca===

In the 1980s the arena became famed for its basketball tournaments including:
*NCAA Men&#x27;s Final Four in 1988
*NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four in 1998
*NCAA Regionals – in 1983, 1986, 1992, and 1995
*NCAA First and Second Rounds – in 1997, 2001, and 2004
*NAIA basketball tournament from 1975 to 1993
*Big Eight Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball Tournament from 1977 to 1996
*Big 12 Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball tournament from 1997 to 2002 and 2005 
*Guardians Classic in 2001
*Mid-Continent Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2003 and 2004

The Kansas Jayhawks also played at least one men&#x27;s basketball game a year in Kemper Arena as an outreach to its fanbase in Kansas City, the last such game being against the Toledo Rockets in the 2006–07 season; since then the Jayhawks have played one regular season game a year in the new T-Mobile Center.

===Other professional sports===
*1974–1976 – Kansas City Scouts of the National Hockey League played in the arena before the team moved to Denver, becoming the Colorado Rockies; they later moved in 1982 to New Jersey, becoming the New Jersey Devils
*1974–1985 – Kansas City Kings of the National Basketball Association who moved from Cincinnati, then to Sacramento
*1981–1991 – Kansas City Comets of the original Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL)
*1992–2005 – Kansas City Attack (later renamed the Kansas City Comets) of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and a later version of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL)
*1990–2001 – Kansas City Blades of the International Hockey League (IHL)
*2000–2002 – Kansas City Knights of the American Basketball Association (ABA)
*2004–2005 – Kansas City Outlaws of the United Hockey League (UHL)
*2006–2007 – Kansas City Brigade of the Arena Football League
*2007 – National Professional Paintball League (NPPL) makes its 4th stop of the 2007 season at Kemper. The event will be the first NPPL event held with a field indoors.
*2013 – Kansas City Renegades of the Champions Professional Indoor Football League (CPIFL)

=== Professional wrestling ===
The Kemper Arena hosted Professional wrestling from 1984 until 2008. Promotions such as Central States Wrestling, WWE, National Wrestling Alliance, Universal Wrestling Federation, and World Championship Wrestling all held events there.

====Death of Owen Hart====

On May 23, 1999, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) hosted the Over the Edge pay-per-view event at Kemper Arena. During the event, Owen Hart, wrestling under his Blue Blazer gimmick, was to make a superhero-like ring entrance, which would have seen him descend from the arena rafters into the ring. He was, however, released prematurely when the harness line malfunctioned, and fell more than into the ring and later died at nearby Truman Medical Center-Hospital Hill. After the incident, the event was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate officials made the decision to continue the event. Criticism later arose over the WWF&#x27;s decision to continue the show after the accident. In court, his widow Martha, children, and parents sued the organization, contending that poor planning of the dangerous stunt caused Owen&#x27;s death. WWF settled the case out of court, paying to his widow, children, and parents. Due to the accident and controversy surrounding the event, the Over the Edge name was retired. The event was also not released for home video viewing until the launch of the WWE Network in 2014, where an edited version of the show that displays a tribute to Hart at the beginning but otherwise removes any mention of his involvement was released. In October 1999, Owen&#x27;s brother, Bret Hart and longtime Hart family friend Chris Benoit had a tribute match in honor of Owen at Kemper Arena on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;.

===1990s additions and renovations===
Additional American Royal livestock buildings were built adjoining Kemper in 1991–92 at a cost of $33.4 million (the City of Kansas City built the original American Royal Arena in 1922 nearby for about $650,000)

In 1997, a $23 million expansion made significant changes to the original Jahn design—most notably a glass-enclosed east lobby. Other changes include: 2,000 more seats, upgraded lower-level seating, four restrooms, and a handicapped entrance to the arena.

==Conversion to youth sports and community gym facility==
In 2017–18, the arena underwent a $29 million renovation by Foutch Architecture and Development LLC to be converted into a youth sports facility. The renovated arena features 12 mixed-use hardwood basketball courts, four on the lower level and eight on the new upper level, and a 350-meter indoor running track. Each level also has spaces for retail services and commercial office space. The renovated arena was previously set to be known as Mosaic Arena as a result of a naming rights sponsorship by Mosaic Life Care; however, Mosaic Life Care released its naming rights sponsorship in December 2017. On May 17, 2018, Midwestern grocery store chain Hy-Vee secured the naming rights, making the arena&#x27;s official name Hy-Vee Arena.

==American Royal==
The American Royal Association formerly hosted livestock events at Kemper starting when it was first constructed. The Royal also helped pay for the original building. Its offices were located in the building along with the American Royal Museum. The Royal moved to a new complex that includes Hale Arena.

<text>The Irish Red and White Setter () is a breed of dog. As with all setters, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter, as well as the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog.

The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. In the UK, their quarry can be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock as all these birds try to avoid predators by hiding rather than flying away. Overseas, they may be used to hunt quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen or francolin.

Despite the breed&#x27;s early origins, it had almost become extinct at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, dedicated breeders managed to revive interest and restore the Irish Red and White setter to a viable position. It is still considered a vulnerable breed but has gained recognition from all major kennel clubs.

==Function==
The function of setters is to find and locate game by quartering ground as it searches for the scent carried in the wind by birds such as grouse, partridge, pheasant or snipe. It is fast and wide-ranging. As it gallops in its quest to seek scent, its head is carried high. Once it locates the birds, it will freeze on point or &quot;set&quot; indicating to its handler where the birds are hiding. It may slightly crouch but its position will remain tense, immobile and rigid. The dog&#x27;s head will remain raised as it savours the airborne scent and it intently stares in the direction of where the birds are hiding. Its tail will be held level with its back. 
The breed is classified in the Gundog Group by the Kennel Club in the U.K. and in the Sporting Group by the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) classify the breed in Group 7 (Pointing dogs), Section 2 (British and Irish Pointers and Setters).

The Irish Red and White Setter still has an ingrained natural working ability, so when correctly trained and given the appropriate opportunity, it will work well performing its original function.

They can take longer to train than other gun dogs, but once trained, they are loyal and reliable companions. They need firm and decisive, but not harsh, training.

==History==
===Origins===
&#x27;Setting dogges&#x27; – an ancient term for setters, were developed to find game birds and would have been used in Roman times. The dog would find the location of the game birds by scenting the air, freeze in either a standing or crouching position, then slowly creep forward on command to disturb the birds into flight. Once the birds were in flight the hunter who had been following the dog would release hawks to capture the birds in the air. When netting superseded the use of hawks, setting dogs would still be used to indicate the whereabouts of the birds, but the hunter would come up behind the dog and throw a net over the birds. In the mid-1600s, guns became more readily available and shooting game birds became a popular pastime of the landed gentry. The basic work of setters was still to find and point to the location of game birds but it also had to be steady to shot.

By the 17th century &#x27;setting dogges&#x27; had become established and the breeds as seen in the present day could be identified as Setters. Interbreeding of differently coloured dogs was still taking place during this period, but this gradually changed and sportsmen started to limit matings to dogs adapted to the terrain they were required to cover.

Originally, setters in Ireland were mostly red, or the parti-colour red and white, or even mostly white dogs. All were accepted as Irish Setters and were mated to each other.

As late as 1875 at a conformation show in Dublin, there were 66 entries in the Irish Setter classes; 23 of these entries were red and white. At a show in Cork the next year, out of 96 entries, there were 36 red and white animals. This was when the fashion for solid red-coloured setters began, leading to a decline in red and white setter numbers. The popularity of the solid red Irish Setter in both America and Ireland gained strength as they attracted very high prices, all adding to the demise of the Irish Red and White almost to the point of extinction. A handful of breeders in remote parts of Ireland kept the breed alive.

A small number of breeders were active from 1775 to the end of the 19th century. The Rossmore family of County Monaghan in Ireland, had a strain of red and white setters dating back to the mid 18th century and this line was preserved into the 20th century. The family still own many paintings of these dogs. During the breed&#x27;s history, red and white setters were sometimes referred to as Rossmore Setters. Other owners recorded at this time included Reverend Mahon of Castlegar, Yelverton O&#x27;Keefe, Maurice Nugent O&#x27;Connor and Miss Lidwell whose name was sometimes misspelt as Ledwich. The dogs from these strains were all particularly known for their working abilities.

===Revival===
Upon returning from the Great War, Irish clergyman Noble Huston attempted a revival of the breed, but despite this, numbers on the island of Ireland remained small. From around 1970, a revival of the breed was planned, and the numbers began to increase slowly. The Irish Kennel Club approached the Irish Red Setter Club during 1976 to ask if it was willing to help oversee the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter.

Partly through the endeavours of the Irish Red and White Setter Field &amp; Show Society, which was formed in 1981, the breed became well established and received national and international recognition. Irish Red and White Setters successfully compete in conformation shows and field trials, attaining champions in both disciplines.

Many individuals contributed to the breed&#x27;s successful revival. Rev. Huston kept a note of his litters in the parish register. He did not have official pedigrees but did engage in lengthy correspondence with Maureen Cuddy (then Clarke), whose kennel name was &#x27;Knockalla&quot;. In a letter to Cuddy, Rev. Huston wrote: &quot;...the present Red and Whites are not a new breed nor a revived breed (like the Irish Wolfhound) but a continued breed...&quot; It was through Cuddy&#x27;s meticulous record keeping and research that in 1974 the Irish Kennel Club finally accepted that the pedigrees of the few remaining Irish Red and Whites were accurate.

It is likely that the revived generations of Irish Red and White Setters descend from a puppy bitch Cuddy nursed to health in 1940. This bitch was named &quot;Judith Cunningham of Knockalla&quot;.

By the 1980s, Irish Red and White Setters were being imported into Great Britain, where the breed was developed more as a show dog. Interest in Great Britain had particularly been revived after Alan and Ann Gormley from Dublin exhibited an Irish Red and White at Crufts in 1980. This was &quot;Harlequin of Knockalla&quot; who was bred by Cuddy in 1977. Harlequin had qualified for Crufts due to his success at shows in Ireland, but the Gormleys were more interested in showing their dogs than in working them. Harlequin did prove he could work while young, but an error with the paperwork meant his qualifying test at a field trial was never correctly recorded. Harlequin was sired by &quot;Glenkeen Sandy&quot; whose grandfather was &quot;Sulhamstead Natty D&#x27;Or&quot;, a field trial dog bred by Florence Nagle.

The breed was little known in Britain and the Kennel Club had inadvertently listed Harlequin&#x27;s Crufts entry among the Irish Setters. This was the trigger for great interest in the breed, as it proved the breed was not extinct as was believed.

Irish Red and White Setters bred by the Gormleys under their kennel name of &#x27;Meudon&#x27; proved influential worldwide as their Red and Whites were exported to Italy, America and Holland, as well as to Great Britain.

In contrast to these British dogs, the breed has continued to be primarily a working and field trial dog in Ireland.

From 1 January 2009, the Irish Red and White Setter was fully recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC), and was eligible to compete in conformation and all other competitive fields. The breed had previously been listed on the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which is the first step towards a purebred breed gaining recognition in America. The breed was given recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club in May 1999.

The breed is recognised by most other national Kennel Clubs. All registered Irish Red and White Setters are the descendants of the dogs accepted by the Irish Kennel Club at the time of the revival of the breed in the 1970s.

It is listed by the Kennel Club in the UK as a Vulnerable Native Breed, due to registration numbers of less than 300 per year.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Irish Red and White Setter should have an aristocratic, well proportioned, balanced appearance yet still be strong and powerful without lumber or coarseness. It does not have the racy appearance of its solid red-coloured cousin, as the Red and White Setter is heavier in body, has a broader head and the peak at the back of his skull is less peaked. They are athletic, keen and intelligent.

The head and body coat is short and flat with long silky fringes – usually these fringes are called &#x27;feathering&#x27;. The feathering forms a fringe on the outside of the ears, neck, chest, down the back of the front legs, under the belly and on the back legs. The tail is also feathered with long coat. The body coat and feathering should be straight and flat but not profuse and never curly.

There are subtle differences between each of the setter breeds. However, one of the main distinguishing features between the setter breeds is colour. As the breed name implies, Irish Red and White Setters must be red and white, and it is an important feature of the breed.

The base colour is a pearly white and there should be solid patches of deep-red. The red colour can be likened to a freshly opened chestnut and should not be light red or gingerish. The face, feet, front and lower hind legs are allowed some mottling or flecking but it must not extend to other areas of the body coat.

Irish Red and White Setters should be combed and well brushed each week to keep the coat well groomed. Any wispy hair on feet should be trimmed away regularly and bushy hair behind ears should be thinned. They should only need to be bathed when necessary as they are easy to keep clean due to the single coat not being too thick. Irish Red and White Setters do not require as much trimming for presentation in conformation shows as the other setters, because they have lighter coats.

The FCI give desired heights of in females and in males, with no stated weight restrictions, while the American KC states that females range in height from , and males from , with a weight around . No specific height or weight is given in the Kennel Club breed standard but males can be up to and weigh around . The height is taken from where the dog&#x27;s neck joins the back (the withers) measured down to the ground.

===Temperament===
The Irish Red and White Setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them. They thrive best in active families, where they have outlets for their high energy, and require space to run freely. Young puppies do not require much exercise but once they reach maturity the breed&#x27;s working instincts mean they require enough space to be able to run hard and fast for a long distance. Setters are usually good natured, very gentle and get on well with children and other dogs.

==Health==
===Hereditary concerns===
Irish Red and White Setters are generally a healthy breed. However, there are three known diseases in the breed which are monitored by the breed clubs.

These are:
*Canine Leucocyte Adhesion Deficiency (CLAD) – a failure of the immune system to fight infection. Young puppies do not thrive and continually pick up infections. They can also have growth problems and may die well before they reach their first birthday. The Kennel Club has only registered Irish Red and White Setters that are proven clear of the CLAD mutation, either by direct DNA testing or by virtue of having parents that are proven to be clear of the CLAD mutation (i.e. hereditarily clear). No carriers can be registered. This ruling came into effect on 17 June 2008;
*von Willebrands Disease (vWD) – a failure of the blood to clot over a wound, which in extreme cases, the dog can bleed to death with only a small wound, if unattended. The Kennel Club will only register litters of Irish Red and White Setters if both parents are DNA tested clear of the von Willebrand Disease (vWD) mutation, or are hereditarily clear of this mutation. This ruling came into effect on 1 January 2011;
*and Posterior Polar Cataract (PPC) – sight is impaired by a cataract on the back of the lens of the eye.

Because of breeders&#x27; proactive approach, in the UK the number of affected dogs have been kept low and CLAD and vWD are &quot;virtually unheard of in the breed today&quot;.

In 2004, the UK Kennel Club established the Accredited Breeders Scheme, which was later called the Assured Breeders scheme (ABS). The scheme received UKAS accreditation in April 2013. ABS members are required to adhere to additional criteria than those necessary for basic KC registration. Among the extra requirements is &quot;Ensuring that the parents of each litter are readily identifiable by either Microchip, Tattoo or DNA profile.&quot; As at March 2013, breeders of Irish Red and White Setters who are members of the ABS must continue to use screening systems for eye testings and DNA checks for vWD and CLAD. It also advises screening for hip dysplasia.

Irish Red and White Setters have an average lifespan of 10 to 12 years.

===Outcross programme===

In an attempt to address the possibility of a very restricted gene pool, the Irish Kennel Club (IKC) announced in 2011 that it was to instigate a programme of allowing Irish Red and White Setters to be crossed with Irish Setters. Any such outcross matings were to be carefully monitored. The programme was supported by the Irish Red and White Setter Club of Ireland, the Irish Red Setter Club (Ireland) and other national Kennel Clubs. The IKC felt there was a high degree of inbreeding within ten generations of Irish Red and White setters and wished to increase the genetic diversity of the breed to prevent genetic problems arising from close inbreeding. It considered that the genes of the working lines of Irish Setters were very similar to those of the Irish Red and White setters and their close ancestry had already been used to aid the revival of the Irish Red and White setter. Before any outcross matings could take place, the mating would have to be approved by the official Outcross Committee. Only dogs with current health tests would be considered.

However, the programme was met with dismay by many other breed clubs worldwide who felt it was a flawed and disappointing decision. An official of the Canadian breed club said: &quot;we cannot condone the crossbreeding of our essentially healthy IRWS breed with dogs of a breed which is known to hold, by various unknown modes of inheritance, far more genetic detritus than ours.&quot; The Irish Red and White Setter Club of GB felt the outcross was not desirable nor necessary. Despite such criticism, some breed clubs have chosen to take part in the programme.

<doc id="766962" wikidata="Q6552879" url="?curid=766962" title="Lindsey German">
<text>Lindsey Ann German (born 1951) is a British left-wing political activist. A founding member and convenor of the British anti-war organisation Stop the War Coalition, she was formerly a member of the Socialist Workers Party, sitting on its central committee and being editor of its magazine, &quot;Socialist Review&quot;.

German has twice stood as a left-wing candidate for Mayor of London, coming fifth in 2004, and as the Left List mayoral candidate in the May 2008 elections. In February 2010, following &quot;increasing disenchantment&quot; with the leadership, she resigned from the SWP, after 37 years&#x27; membership.

== Early life and activities ==
Lindsey German was born in London in 1951 and educated in Hillingdon at Vyners, then a state grammar school. In 1970 she attended the &quot;Stop the &#x27;70 Tour&quot; demonstration organised by Peter Hain against the tour of the all-white South African cricket team.

German joined the International Socialists (later the Socialist Workers Party) in 1972, the same year she began to read law at the London School of Economics. She was active in the original National Abortion Campaign in April 1975, then responding to a parliamentary private member&#x27;s bill put forward by Glasgow Labour MP James White, and was involved in campaigns to achieve equal pay for women. German had become a full-time official by 1977 for what was now the Socialist Workers Party and a member of the party&#x27;s central committee.

== Stop the War and Respect ==

German was involved in setting up the Stop the War Coalition in September 2001. It was established to oppose the war in Afghanistan and later Iraq. German became convenor of the Stop the War Coalition, speaking at meetings and demonstrations.

In January 2004, German supported the move to form Respect – The Unity Coalition, which included the SWP and other opponents of the war in Iraq, including Muslim groups and which stood as a left alternative to the Labour Party in elections. At the SWP&#x27;s Marxism 2003 event she commented: &quot;I&#x27;m in favour of defending gay rights, [...] but I am not prepared to have it as a shibboleth, [created by] people who . . . regard the state of Israel as somehow a viable presence.&quot;

She was Respect&#x27;s candidate for the London Mayoral election in June 2004, in addition to being first in the list for election to the London Assembly. She came 5th in the mayoral election with 63,294 first and second preference votes (3.3% of the total) and in the assembly election came just below the 5% threshold in the top-up section (the assembly election followed the Additional Member System) which would have gained her a seat on the assembly. In the 2005 general election she was the Respect candidate for the West Ham, London, constituency and came second with 19.5% of the vote.

== Departure from SWP ==
On 18 April 2007 she was selected as Respect&#x27;s candidate for the 2008 London Mayoral election. However, a subsequent split within the organisation meant that German was not able to use the party&#x27;s name in the election. Instead German stood as the candidate for Mayor and the assembly under the Left List name, the SWP part of Respect, finishing in eighth place in the election to be mayor with 16,796 votes on first preference.

According to journalist John Anderson, German was a leading figure promoting further ties between the SWP and various organizations such as the Muslim Association of Britain and the British Muslim Initiative.

German&#x27;s employment by the SWP lasted until the January 2009 SWP party conference. At that conference the proposed slate did not include John Rees, German&#x27;s partner and another long-standing member of the Central Committee (CC). German proposed an alternative slate which did include Rees. When it became clear this would be overwhelmingly defeated, German and Chris Nineham withdrew their names from the election and were not selected. As the Central Committee slate was the only proposed slate that went to the vote at conference she was not re-elected to the SWP&#x27;s Central Committee in 2009. In 2010, German resigned from the SWP.

German was the editor of the party&#x27;s monthly magazine, &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, from 1984 until April 2004.

== Post-SWP==
She has written several books, including two on women&#x27;s rights and &quot;A People&#x27;s History of London&quot;, co-written with her partner, John Rees.

In August 2015, German endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

In 2019, German wrote that there was little evidence for an epidemic of antisemitism within the Labour Party, with a &quot;very small number of cases proved, and a small number of accusations made&quot;. She wrote that such allegations were &quot;political attacks - against Corbyn and his left wing politics, and against all those who criticise the state of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians. These are the real reasons for their scale and ferocity, and why they are taken up with such enthusiasm by the BBC and the rest of the media.&quot;

In 2022, in response to the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, German wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticising Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer&#x27;s support of the NATO alliance.

<text>The &quot;Barbel&quot;-class submarines, the last diesel-electric propelled attack submarines built by the United States Navy, incorporated numerous, radical engineering improvements over previous classes. They were the first production warships built with the teardrop-shape hull first tested on the experimental , and the first to combine the control room, attack center, and conning tower in the same space in the hull. They were of double hull design with 1.5-inch thick HY80 steel. This class of submarine became part of the United States Navy&#x27;s fleet in 1959 and was taken out of service 1988–1990, leaving the Navy with an entirely nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

The &quot;Barbel&quot; class&#x27; design is considered to be very effective. The s of the Netherlands and the of the Republic of China (designed and built in the Netherlands) were closely derived from the &quot;Barbel&quot; class design. The Japanese and its successors were also influenced by the &quot;Barbel&quot; class.

==Design==
Designed under project SCB 150, the class overall was a somewhat smaller diesel-powered version of the nuclear submarines, the first of which entered service only three months after &quot;Barbel&quot;, having been laid down only 11 days later. Several features of the experimental were used in the &quot;Barbel&quot;-class design, most obviously the fully streamlined &quot;teardrop&quot; hull. &quot;Albacore&quot;″s single-shaft configuration, necessary to minimize drag and thus maximize speed, was also adopted for the &quot;Barbel&quot;s, &quot;Skipjack&quot;s, and all subsequent US nuclear submarines. This was a matter of considerable debate and analysis within the Navy, as two shafts offered redundancy and improved maneuverability. For the first time, the &quot;Barbel&quot;s also did away with the conning tower, instead combining the functions of attack center and control room into the same space, another feature adopted for all subsequent US submarines. This was facilitated by the adoption of &quot;push-button&quot; ballast control, another feature of &quot;Albacore&quot;. Previous designs had routed the trim system piping through the control room, where the valves were manually operated. The &quot;push-button&quot; system used hydraulic operators on each valve, remotely electrically operated (actually via toggle switches) from the control room. This greatly conserved control room space and reduced the time required to conduct trim operations. The overall layout made coordination of the weapons and ship control systems easier during combat operations.

The torpedo tube arrangement of the &quot;Barbel&quot;s was the same as the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s″, with six bow tubes in a three-over-three configuration. These (and the &quot;Skipjack&quot;-derived &quot;George Washington&quot;-class SSBNs) were the only US Navy classes to have this configuration, as subsequent SSN designs used four angled midships torpedo tubes to make room for a large bow sonar sphere, and most SSBNs had four bow tubes.

The &quot;Barbel&quot;s were built with bow mounted diving planes, but these were replaced by sail planes (aka fairwater planes) within a few years. This feature was standard on US Navy submarines until bow planes returned with the improved , the first of which was launched in 1987.
