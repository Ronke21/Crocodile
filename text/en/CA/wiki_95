<text>The New York Institute of Technology (NYIT or New York Tech) is a private research university founded in 1955. It has two main campuses in New York—one in Old Westbury, on Long Island and one on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. Additionally, it has a cybersecurity research lab, a biosciences and bioengineering lab, Nassau County’s first Class 10,000 clean room for nanoengineering, and the Entrepreneurship and Technology Innovation Center, which has close links to NASA, in Old Westbury, as well as campuses in Arkansas, China, and Canada. The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated NYIT as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education.

NYIT has over 100 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. It awards bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees for the completion of these programs. It has five schools and two colleges, all with an emphasis on technology and applied scientific research.

The New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab has played an important role in the history of computer graphics and animation, as founders of Pixar and Lucasfilm, including Turing Award winners Edwin Catmull and Patrick Hanrahan, began their research there. NYIT is the birthplace of entirely 3D CGI films.

New York Tech enrolled 7,711 full-time students across its campuses worldwide in 2023. NYIT&#x27;s intercollegiate competitive sports teams, include its four-time NCAA Division II national champion lacrosse team. All of NYIT&#x27;s teams compete in Division II. In 2019, NYIT became a College World Series team. The NYIT Bears are part of the East Coast Conference.

==History==
===Foundation and vision===
In 1910, the New York Institute of Technology&#x27;s predecessor, New York Technical Institute, opened. In 1955, the New York Institute of Technology opened under a provisional charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents to NYIT. Its first campus opened at 500 Pacific Street in Brooklyn, New York. The founders of NYIT, and in particular, Alexander Schure, started NYIT based on the European polytechnic university model, with the mission of offering career-oriented professional education, providing all qualified students access to opportunity, and supporting applications-oriented research. Schure later served as NYIT&#x27;s first president. In the higher education community at the time, a debate arose around the concern that humanities studies would be overshadowed by too much emphasis on science and engineering. NYIT&#x27;s goal was to create a balance between science/engineering and a liberal arts education, and ever since, it has been focusing on this model to prepare students for current and future careers.

By the 1958–1959 academic year, the university had 300 students, and the time had come to expand its physical operations. In April 1958, the college purchased the Pythian Temple at 135–145 W. 70th St. in Manhattan for its main center. The building, adjacent to the planned Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, was an ornate 12-story structure with a columned entranceway. Built in 1929 at a cost of $2 million, it included among its features a 1,200-seat auditorium. In 1958, NYIT sponsored the first National Technology Awards, created by Frederick Pittera, an organizer of international fairs and a member of the NYIT Board of Trustees, to help raise funds for the NYIT science and technology laboratories. The awards, held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, were attended by several hundred guests, with entertainment provided by the U.S. Air Force Band. Senate Majority Leader and future President of the United States Lyndon Johnson was the keynote speaker. His speech was broadcast nationally by the ABC Radio Network. Among the honorees were Dr. Wernher von Braun and Major General Bernard Schriever, Commanding General of the Ballistic Air Command. Photos, press clippings, and audio tapes of the event are on view at the Lyndon Johnson Library at Austin, Texas.

===Distinction through technology===
====Teaching Machines====
In 1959, NYIT introduced “teaching machines” for student instruction in physics, electronics, and mathematics. NYIT also pioneered the use of mainframes as a teaching tool, having received its first, donated by the CIT Financial Corporation, in 1965. The curriculum was successful enough that NYIT received two grants totaling approximately $3 million from the federal government – one to develop a system of individualized learning through the use of computers; the other to develop a computer-based course in general physics for midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. WLIW (TV) got studio space when it moved in to the New York Institute of Technology in Westbury in 1974, but that arrangement lasted two years.

====NYIT Computer Graphics Lab====
In 1974, the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab was established and attracted the likes of: Pixar Animation Studios president Edwin Catmull and co-founder Alvy Ray Smith; Walt Disney Feature Animation Chief Scientist Lance Williams; DreamWorks animator Hank Grebe; and Netscape and Silicon Graphics founder James H. Clark. Researchers at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made entirely 3D CGI films possible. NYIT CG Lab was regarded as the top computer animation research and development group in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.

====Clean Air Road Rally====
In 1995, the NYIT School of Engineering took first place in the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Clean Air Road Rally. The student engineering team spent three years designing and building the high-performance hybrid electric car that beat 43 other vehicles. In 1998, NYIT opened its first international program in China. In 1999, Bill Gates spoke at NYIT and received NYIT&#x27;s Presidential Medal. In 2002, NYIT installed the fastest broadband network on the East Coast.

===The 21st century===
In 2003, NYIT opened its Bahrain site to students seeking an American-style education in the Middle East. In 2005, NYIT participated in its first Solar Decathlon, an international competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. NYIT was one of nineteen colleges internationally and the only school in the New York metropolitan area. The team, composed of students and faculty, captured fifth place honors. In 2007, NYIT co-hosted the International Energy Conference and Exhibition in Daegu, South Korea. In 2007 the university received $500,000 in federal funding to develop a &quot;green print&quot; initiative to research alternative fuel technology and determine its carbon footprint. In 2008, NYIT installed a 3-D motion capture lab for its Fine Arts program in Old Westbury. The system allows the university to use technology to teach the next generation of computer animators. In 2008 NYIT was awarded a $130,000 research contract by United Space Alliance to help NASA scientists design the crew module of the Orion spacecraft using 3-D motion capture technology. NYIT&#x27;s College of Osteopathic Medicine also uses 3-D motion capture technology to help doctors better identify mobility and stability problems in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In July 2008 NYIT sponsored the first annual International Water Conference at the United Nations in New York City. The event brought together representatives from non-governmental organizations, international corporations, and universities to discuss the need to safeguard the planet&#x27;s water resources. In 2009 NYIT sponsored its second U.N. event, the International Energy Conference (Aug. 31-Sept. 1, 2009) to welcome energy secretaries, policy makers, and executives from multinational companies to examine opportunities and innovations in the field of sustainable technology. NYIT closed its campuses in Jordan and Bahrain in 2013 and 2014 respectively. NYIT had to close its campus in Bahrain because the Higher Education Council of Bahrain decided to come up with a new set of regulations, aiming to standardize all private universities in Bahrain. NYIT could not adapt to the changes like the other local universities in Bahrain, as all NYIT campuses around the world must follow the same American standard programs, otherwise they would be threatened to lose their international license and accreditation. In 2015, NYIT received from New York State a grant of $0.4 million for a portion of the costs required to renovate a 5,300-square-foot facility to house three new laboratories on its Old Westbury campus.

In 2018, NYIT and Holon Institute of Technology, a university based in Israel, signed a memorandum of understanding to pursue research opportunities for faculty and students at both universities.

==Campuses==


=== Old Westbury ===


New York Institute of Technology&#x27;s Old Westbury, New York, campus is seated on . It encompasses numerous contiguous former estates situated in the wooded hillsides of Old Westbury, New York. Some of these estates were formerly owned by members of the Rockefeller family. Opened in 1965, the campus has many buildings including a sports complex, administrative and academic buildings, a 100-seat &quot;smart&quot; auditorium, several dining halls, a bookstore, as well as NYIT&#x27;s de Seversky Mansion, a party and event venue on Long Island, and one of the largest houses in the United States. It was developed on and around the nucleus of the former C. V. Whitney estate and includes several former North Shore estates. Original buildings have been reconstructed for educational use while retaining the charm of traditional exteriors. To preserve the natural beauty of the landscape, other buildings are clustered in low, modern structures surrounded by trees and open vistas. Classroom buildings and parking areas are connected by walkways through woods and meadows untouched by construction. Plazas connect classroom buildings and act as outdoor rooms for students and faculty. Concerts, lectures, and informal recreational events are frequently scheduled on campus.

Athletic facilities at the Old Westbury campus include the 1,000-seat President&#x27;s Stadium, the President&#x27;s Field, the 500-seat Recreation Hall arena, the NYIT Softball Complex and the NYIT Tennis Complex consisting of six courts.

<text>Töv Province (from Mongolian &quot;төв&quot; &#x27;centre&#x27;) is one of the 21 provinces of Mongolia. The national capital Ulaanbaatar is located roughly at its center, but the city itself is administered as an independent municipality.

== Geography ==
The province (aimag) includes the western part of the Khentii Mountains, the mountains around the capital, as well as rolling steppe in the south and west.
The most interesting body of water is the Tuul River, which crosses Ulaanbaatar and later joins the Orkhon River.

== Population ==
Töv Province is populated primarily by Khalkha Mongols, followed by Kazakhs, Buryats, and Dörbet Oirats.

== Traffic ==
The central traffic node is the enclave Ulaanbaatar. The city includes the largest station of the Trans-Mongolian Railway and the Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport.
A small airport with an unpaved runway also exists in the aimag capital Zuunmod.

== Culture ==
&quot;Manzushir Monastery&quot; is located near Zuunmod in the Bogd Khan Mountain national park.
It was founded in 1733 and used to be the home of 20 temples and 300 monks. Most of it was destroyed by the communists, yet the last temple was restored after democratisation and hosts a small museum today.

== National parks ==
The Gorkhi-Terelj National Park was founded in 1993. It covers a part of the Khentii Mountains. It is most well known for its spectacular rock formations, including a rock that looks like a giant turtle from the right perspective. The landscape has an alpine character, with larch and pine forests, sparkling mountain rivers, and very diverse flora and fauna.

In Khustain Nuruu National Park, about 120 km south west of Ulaanbaatar, the original wild horses, &quot;Takhi&quot; of Mongolia (Przewalski horses) have been released to the wild again in a process first begun in 1993. The project has been quite successful, and has developed into an attraction for both scientists and tourists.

The Gun-Galuut Nature Reserve is a protected area founded in 2003 to conserve globally threatened species and their habitat. The IUCN red-listed species - white-naped crane, hooded crane, Siberian white crane, swan goose and argali-wild mountain sheep and many other species listed in the National Red book of Mongolia are found here.

Because it is considered sacred, the mountain Mount Bogd Khan south of Ulaanbaatar has been a protected area since 1778. During socialism, it was formally established as a national park. This stopped the urban sprawl of the capital on its southern side.

==Maidar City==

In Sergelen, the urban development project Maidar City is planned to relieve the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar. This project will multiply the population of this aimag.

== Administrative subdivisions ==


==Economy==
In 2018, the province contributed to 1.85% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

<text>Zavkhan (; ), also spelt Zaukhan or Zabhkhan, is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia, located in the west of the country, 1,104 km from Ulaanbaatar. Its capital is Uliastai. The aimag is named after the Zavkhan River, which forms the border between Zavkhan and Gobi-Altai aimag.

== Environment ==
Locally, Zavkhan&#x27;s environment is considered &quot;Gobi-Khangai&quot; (Говь хангай), since it connects the Gobi Desert in the south with the western Khangai Mountain Range and the broad lake basin of Khovd aimag. 

The highest peak in the province is Otgontenger (Отгонтэнгэр, lit. &quot;youngest sky&quot;) both the highest (4,031 m) and only peak in the Khangai range capped with a permanent glacier. The mountain is located in the 95,510 hectare Otgon Tenger Strictly Protected Area, about 60 km east of Uliastai. An image of the mountain can be seen on the aimag&#x27;s coat of arms. Otgontenger is associated with the Bodhisattva Ochirvaani (Очирваань). 

The western and south-western regions of Zavkhan contain the massive Bor Khyarin Els sand dunes that stretch for over 100 km within the Zavkhan, down into Gobi-Altai aimag. One of the largest lakes in Zavkhan, Bayan Nuur (баян нуур, &quot;rich lake&quot;) is nestled among the dunes.

== Climate == 
Zavkhan has some of the coldest winter temperatures in Mongolia. It has even been known to snow in summer. In Tosontsengel, the largest &quot;sum&quot; in Zavkhan, winter temperatures as low as −52.9 °C (−63.2 °F) have been recorded. That &quot;sum&quot; also holds the record for the highest mean sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth , measured on 19 December 2001.

Most precipitation falls in the summer months as rain, with some snow in the adjacent months of May and September. Winters are typically very dry.

== Wildlife == 
Aside from having massive livestock populations, Zavkhan&#x27;s broad ecological regions and deep forests are home to a diverse population of wildlife: Gobi bears, Mongolian khulans, wild boars, spotted deers, argali, wild goats, ibexes, Mongolian wolves, Corsac foxes, marmots, mongooses, Eurasian lynxes, hares, and both Mongolian and goitered gazelle.

Many forest, mountain and migratory birds can be found in the aimag, including rare snowcocks and bobwhites, as well as swans, vultures, falcons and hawks. 

Fishing is a popular pastime in Zavkhan. Khar Nuur and Bayan Nuur lakes are rich with fish, and many of the hundreds of smaller rivers throughout the province provide decent fishing.

== Population ==
Population growth in Zavkhan aimag stopped in 1994, then migration out of the aimag (approx. 40,000 in 1995-2005) reduced its population to the end of 1979 level. The majority of the population is ethnic Khalkha but there are sizable Khotgoid and Kazakh minorities. 

== Notable natives and residents == 
* Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, First President of Mongolia (1990-1997)
* Natsagiin Bagabandi, Second President of Mongolia (1997-2005)
* S. Damdinbazar Mongolian Jalkhanz Khotagt (Жалханз Хутагт, &quot;reincarnated saint&quot;) Independence activist and Prime Minister of Mongolia (1922-1923)
* Begziin Yavuukhulan, Mongolian poet
* Noroviin Baatar, Mongolian ballet dancer and film actor 
* B. Jamsranjav, Mongolian Saint, Lama 
* S. Chimedtseren, Mongolian Saint, Lama

== Economy ==
Herders breed each of the &quot;5 Kinds&quot; (5-н хошуу мал)of animal in Zavkhan. In 2005, the aimag was home to 2,1 million head of livestock, among them 1,03 million sheep, 861,000 goats, 107,000 cattle and yaks, 101,000 horses, and 6,300 camels.

The area is also rich with mineral resources such as iron ore, tin, gold, copper, diamonds, molybdenum ore, and phosphorite. While Zavkhan&#x27;s mineral wealth remains 
largely been unexploited, in 2012 the Golden Hill Project mine was built by Bayan Airag Exploration LLC outside of Durvuljin soum. 

In 2018, the province contributed to 1.08% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

== Transportation ==
The old Uliastai Airport has two unpaved runways and is located close to the city, but it has no regular flights operating. Since 2002, the Donoi Airport (or &quot;New Uliastai Airport&quot;) with one unpaved runway is located about 25 km west of the city and gets served by regular flights to and from Ulaanbaatar.

<doc id="791314" wikidata="Q423506" url="?curid=791314" title="Actualism">
<text>In analytic philosophy, actualism is the view that everything there &quot;is&quot; (i.e., everything that has &quot;being&quot;, in the broadest sense) is . Another phrasing of the thesis is that the domain of unrestricted quantification ranges over all and only actual existents.

The denial of actualism is possibilism, the thesis that there are some entities that are &quot;merely possible&quot;: these entities have being but are not actual and, hence, enjoy a &quot;less robust&quot; sort of being than do actually existing things. An important, but significantly different notion of possibilism known as &quot;modal realism&quot; was developed by the philosopher David Lewis. On Lewis&#x27;s account, the actual world is identified with the physical universe of which we are all a part. Other possible worlds exist in exactly the same sense as the actual world; they are simply spatio-temporally unrelated to our world, and to each other. Hence, for Lewis, &quot;merely possible&quot; entities—entities that exist in other possible worlds—exist in exactly the same sense as do we in the actual world; to be actual, from the perspective of any given individual &quot;x&quot; in any possible world, is simply to be part of the same world as &quot;x&quot;.

Actualists face the problem of explaining why many expressions commonly used in natural language are meaningful and sometimes even true despite the fact that they contain references to non-actual entities. Problematic expressions include names of fictional characters, definite descriptions and intentional attitude reports. Actualists have often responded to this problem by paraphrasing the expressions with apparently problematic ontological commitments into ones that are free of such commitments. Actualism has been challenged by truthmaker theory to explain how truths about what is possible or necessary depend on actuality, i.e. to point out which actual entities can act as truthmakers for them. Popular candidates for this role within an actualist ontology include possible worlds conceived as abstract objects, essences and dispositions.

Actualism and possibilism in ethics are two different theories about how future choices affect what the agent should presently do. Actualists assert that it is only relevant what the agent would actually do later for assessing the normative status of an alternative. Possibilists, on the other hand, hold that we should also take into account what the agent could do, even if he wouldn&#x27;t do it.

==Example==
Consider the statement &quot;Sherlock Holmes exists.&quot; This is a false statement about the world, but is usually accepted as representing a possible truth. This contingency is usually described by the statement &quot;there is a possible world in which Sherlock Holmes exists&quot;. The possibilist argues that apparent existential claims such as this (that &quot;there are&quot; possible worlds of various sorts) ought to be taken more or less at face value: as stating the &quot;existence&quot; of two or more worlds, only one of which (at the most) can be the actual one. Hence, they argue, there are innumerably many possible worlds other than our own, which exist just as much as ours does.

Most actualists will be happy to grant the interpretation of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; existence is possible&quot; in terms of possible worlds. But they argue that the possibilist goes wrong in taking this as a sign that there exist other worlds that are just like ours, except for the fact that we are not actually in them. The actualist argues, instead, that when we claim &quot;possible worlds&quot; exist we are making claims that things exist &quot;in our own actual world&quot; which can serve as possible worlds for the interpretation of modal claims: that many &quot;ways the world could be&quot; (actually) exist, but not that any &quot;worlds which are those ways&quot; exist other than the actual world around us.

==Viewpoints==
From an actualist point of view, such as Robert Merrihew Adams&#x27;, possible worlds are nothing more than fictions created within the actual world. Possible worlds are mere descriptions of ways this world (the actual one) might have been, and nothing else. Thus, as modal constructions, they come in as a handy heuristic device to use with modal logic; as it helps our modal reasoning to imagine ways the world might have been. Thus, the actualist interpretation of &quot;◊p&quot; sees the modality (i.e., &quot;the way&quot; in which it is true) as being de dicto and not entailing any ontological commitment.

So, from this point of view, what distinguishes the actual world from other possible worlds is what distinguishes reality from a description of a simulation of reality, this world from Sherlock Holmes&#x27;: the former exists and is not a product of imagination and the latter does not exist and is a product of the imagination set in a modal construction.

From a modal realist&#x27;s point of view, such as Lewis&#x27;, the proposition &quot;◊p&quot; means that p obtains in at least one other, distinct world that is as real as the one we are in. If a state of affairs is possible, then it really obtains, it physically occurs in at least one world. Therefore, as Lewis is happy to admit, there is a world where someone named Sherlock Holmes lived at 221b Baker Street in Victorian times, there is another world where pigs fly, and there is even another world where both Sherlock Holmes exists and pigs fly.

This leaves open the question, of course, of what an actually existing &quot;way the world could be&quot; &quot;is&quot;; and on this question actualists are divided. One of the most popular solutions is to claim, as William Lycan and Adams do, that &quot;possible worlds&quot; talk can be reduced to logical relations amongst consistent and maximally complete &quot;sets of propositions&quot;. &quot;Consistent&quot; here means that none of its propositions contradict one another (if they did, it would not be a &quot;possible&quot; description of the world); &quot;maximally complete&quot; means that the set covers &quot;every&quot; feature of the world. (More precisely: a set of propositions is &quot;maximally complete&quot; if, for &quot;any&quot; meaningful proposition P, P is either an element of the set, or the &quot;negation&quot; of an element of the set, or entailed by the conjunction of one or more elements of the set, or the &quot;negation&quot; of a proposition entailed by the conjunction of one or more elements of the set). Here the &quot;possible world&quot; which is said to be actual is actual in virtue of &quot;all&quot; its elements being &quot;true&quot; of the world around us.

Another common actualist account, advanced in different forms by Alvin Plantinga and David Armstrong, views &quot;possible worlds&quot; not as &quot;descriptions&quot; of how the world might be (through a very large set of statements) but rather as a maximally complete &quot;state of affairs&quot; that covers every &quot;state of affairs&quot; which might obtain or not obtain. Here, the &quot;possible world&quot; which is said to be actual is actual in virtue of that state of affairs obtaining in the world around us (since it is maximally complete, only &quot;one&quot; such state of affairs could actually obtain; all the others would differ from the actual world in various large or small ways).

==Language and non-actual objects==
Actualism, the view that being is restricted to actual being, is usually contrasted with possibilism, the view that being also includes possible entities, so-called &quot;possibilia&quot;. But there is a third and even wider-ranging view, Meinongianism, which holds that being includes impossible entities. So actualists disagree with both possibilists and Meinongians whether there are possible objects, e.g. unicorns, while actualists and possibilists disagree with Meinongians whether there are impossible objects, e.g. round squares. 

The disagreements between these three views touch many areas in philosophy, including the semantics of natural language and the problem of intentionality. This is due to the fact that various expressions commonly used in natural language seem to refer to merely possible and in some cases even impossible objects. Since actualists deny the existence of such objects, it would seem that they are committed to the view that these expressions don&#x27;t refer to anything and are therefore meaningless. This would be a rather unintuitive consequence of actualism, which is why actualists have proposed different strategies for different types of expressions in order to avoid this conclusion. These strategies usually involve some kind of paraphrase that transforms a sentence with apparently problematic ontological commitments into one that is free of such commitments.

===Names and definite descriptions===
Names of non-existent entities, like the &#x27;planet&#x27; Vulcan, or names of fictional characters, like Sherlock Holmes, are one type of problematic expressions. These expressions are usually considered meaningful despite the fact that neither &quot;Vulcan&quot; nor &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; have actual existence. Similar cases come from definite descriptions that fail to refer, like &quot;the present king of France&quot;. Possibilists and Meinongians have no problem to account for the meaning of these expressions: they just refer to possible objects. (Possibilists share this problem with the actualists in case of definite descriptions involving impossibility like &quot;the round square&quot;) A widely known solution to these problems comes from Bertrand Russell. He proposed to analyze both names and definite descriptions in terms of quantified expressions. For example, the expression &quot;The present king of France is bald&quot; could be paraphrased as &quot;there is exactly one thing that is currently king of France, and all such things are bald&quot;. This sentence is false, but it doesn&#x27;t contain a reference to any non-actual entities anymore, thanks to the paraphrase. So the actualist has solved the problem of accounting for its meaning.

===Intentional attitude reports===
Intentional attitude reports about non-actual entities are another type of problematic cases, for example &quot;Peter likes Superman&quot;. Possibilists can interpret the intentional attitude, in this case the liking, as a relation between Peter, an actual person, and Superman, a possible person. One actualist solution to this problem involves treating intentional attitudes not as relations between a subject and an object but as properties of the subject. This approach has been termed &quot;adverbialism&quot; since the object of the intentional attitude is seen as a modification of the attitude: &quot;Peter likes superman-ly&quot;. This paraphrase succeeds in removing any reference to non-actual entities.

==Truthmaker theory and modal truths==
Truthmaker theorists hold that truth depends on reality. In the terms of truthmaker theory: a truthbearer (e.g. a proposition) is true because of the existence of its truthmaker (e.g. a fact). Positing a truth without being able to account for its truthmaker violates this principle and has been labeled &quot;ontological cheating&quot;. Actualists face the problem of how to account for the truthmakers of modal truths, like &quot;it was possible for the Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate into a full-scale nuclear war&quot;, &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot; or &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot;. Actualists have proposed various solutions, but there is no consensus as to which one is the best solution.

===Possible worlds===
A well-known account relies on the notion of possible worlds, conceived as actual abstract objects, for example as maximal consistent sets of propositions or of states of affairs. A set of propositions is maximal if, for any statement &quot;p&quot;, either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;not-p&quot; is a member. Possible worlds act as truthmakers for modal truths. For example, there is a possible world which is inhabited by purple cows. This world is a truthmaker for &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot;. Cows are animals in all possible worlds that are inhabited by cows. So all worlds are the truthmaker of &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot;. This account relies heavily on a logical notion of modality, since possibility and necessity are defined in terms of consistency. This dependency has prompted some philosophers to assert that no truthmakers at all are needed for modal truths, that modal truths are true &quot;by default&quot;. This position involves abandoning truthmaker maximalism.

===Essences===
An alternative solution to the problem of truthmakers for modal truths is based on the notion of essence. Objects have their properties either essentially or accidentally. The essence of an object involves all the properties it has essentially; it defines the object&#x27;s nature: what it fundamentally is. On this type of account, the truthmaker for &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot; is that it belongs to the essence of cows to be animals. The truthmaker for &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot; is that color is not essential to cows. Some essentialist theories focus on object essences, i.e. that certain properties are essential to a specific object. Other essentialist theories focus on kind essences, i.e. that certain properties are essential to the kind or species of the object in question.

===Dispositions===
Another account attempts to ground modal truths in the dispositions or powers of actually existing entities. So, for example, the claim that &quot;it&#x27;s possible that the teacup breaks&quot; has its truthmaker in the teacup&#x27;s disposition to break, i.e. in its fragility. While this type of theory can account for various truths, it has been questioned whether it can account for all truths. Problematic cases include truths like &quot;it&#x27;s possible that nothing existed&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s possible that the laws of nature had been different&quot;. A theistic version of this account has been proposed in order to solve these problems: God&#x27;s power is the truthmaker for modal truths. &quot;There could have been purple cows&quot; because it was in God&#x27;s power to create purple cows, while &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot; because it was not in God&#x27;s power to create cows that are not animals.

===Softcore vs hardcore===
These solutions proposed on behalf of actualism can be divided into two categories: Softcore actualism and hardcore actualism. The adherents of these positions disagree on which part of the actual world is the foundation supporting modal truths. &quot;Softcore actualists&quot; hold that modal truths are grounded in the abstract realm, for example in possible worlds conceived as abstract objects existing in the actual world. &quot;Hardcore actualists&quot;, on the other hand, assert that modal truths are grounded in the concrete constituents of the actual world, for example in essences or in dispositions.

==Indexical actuality analysis==
According to the indexical conception of actuality, favoured by Lewis (1986), actuality is an attribute which our world has relative to itself, but which all the other worlds have relative to themselves too. Actuality is an intrinsic property of each world, so world &quot;w&quot; is actual just at world &quot;w&quot;. &quot;Actual&quot; is seen as an indexical term, and its reference depends on its context. Therefore, there is no feature of this world (nor of any other) to be distinguished in order to infer that the world is actual, &quot;the actual world&quot; is actual simply in virtue of the definition of &quot;actual&quot;: a world is actual &quot;simpliciter&quot;.

== Ethics ==
Actualism and possibilism in ethics are, in contrast to the main part of this article, not concerned with metaphysical claims. Instead, their goal, as ethical theories, is to determine what one ought to do. They are mostly, but not exclusively, relevant for consequentialism, the theory that an action is right if and only if its consequences are better than the consequences of any alternative action. These consequences may include other actions of the agent at a later point in time. Actualists assert that it is only relevant what the agent &quot;would&quot; actually do later for assessing the value of an alternative. Possibilists, on the other hand, hold that we should also take into account what the agent &quot;could&quot; do, even if she wouldn&#x27;t do it.

For example, assume that Gifre has the choice between two alternatives, eating a cookie or not eating anything. Having eaten the first cookie, Gifre could stop eating cookies, which is the best alternative. But after having tasted one cookie, Gifre would freely decide to continue eating cookies until the whole bag is finished, which would result in a terrible stomach ache and would be the worst alternative. Not eating any cookies at all, on the other hand, would be the second-best alternative. Now the question is: should Gifre eat the first cookie or not? Actualists are only concerned with the actual consequences. According to them, Gifre should not eat any cookies at all since it is better than the alternative leading to a stomach ache. Possibilists contend that the best possible course of action involves eating the first cookie and this is therefore what Gifre should do.

One counterintuitive consequence of actualism is that agents can avoid moral obligations simply by having an imperfect moral character. For example, a lazy person might justify rejecting a request to help a friend by arguing that, due to her lazy character, she wouldn&#x27;t have done the work anyway, even if she had accepted the request. By rejecting the offer right away, she managed at least not to waste anyone&#x27;s time. Actualists might even consider her behavior praiseworthy since she did what, according to actualism, she ought to have done. This seems to be a very easy way to &quot;get off the hook&quot; that is avoided by possibilism. But possibilism has to face the objection that in some cases it sanctions and even recommends what actually leads to the worst outcome.

Douglas W. Portmore has suggested that these and other problems of actualism and possibilism can be avoided by constraining what counts as a genuine alternative for the agent. On his view, it is a requirement that the agent has rational control over the event in question. For example, eating only one cookie and stopping afterward only is an option for Gifre if she has the rational capacity to repress her temptation to continue eating. If the temptation is irrepressible then this course of action is not considered to be an option and is therefore not relevant when assessing what the best alternative is. Portmore suggests that, given this adjustment, we should prefer a view very closely associated with &quot;possibilism&quot; called &quot;maximalism&quot;.

<text>The California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) is a vulnerable amphibian native to California. It is a mole salamander. Previously considered to be a subspecies of the tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum)&quot;, the California tiger salamander was recently designated a separate species again. The California tiger salamander distinct population segment (DPS) in Sonoma County and the Santa Barbara County DPS are listed as federally endangered, while the Central California DPS is listed as federally threatened. The Sonoma County, south San Joaquin, and the Santa Barbara County DPS have diverged from the rest of the California tiger salamander populations for over one million years, since the Pleistocene and they may warrant status as separate species.

== Description ==

The California tiger salamander is a relatively large, secretive amphibian endemic to California. Adults can grow to a total length of about 7–8 inches. It has a stocky body and a broad, rounded snout. Adults are black with yellow or cream spots; larvae are greenish-grey in color. The California tiger salamander has brown protruding eyes with black irises.

== Habitat and range ==

The California tiger salamander depends on vernal pools and other seasonal ponds and stock ponds for reproduction; its habitat is limited to the vicinity of large, fishless vernal pools or similar water bodies. It occurs at elevations up to 1000 m (3200 ft). Adults migrate at night from upland habitats to aquatic breeding sites beginning with the first major rainfall of fall and winter, and return to upland habitats after breeding.

Historically, the California tiger salamander probably occurred in grassland habitats throughout much of the state. It occurs from Sonoma County, especially in the Laguna de Santa Rosa (outside the floodplain), south to Santa Barbara County, in vernal pool complexes and isolated ponds along the Central Valley from Colusa County to Kern County, and in the coastal range. Both the Santa Barbara and Sonoma populations are listed as endangered since 2000 and 2003, respectively. On August 4, 2004, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed the California tiger salamander as threatened within the Central DPS, effective September 3, 2004, reaffirming the prior endangered listings of the other distinct population segments and extending protection to all remaining populations.

The six populations are found in Sonoma County, the Bay Area (Stanislaus County, western Merced County, and most of San Benito County), the Central Valley, the southern San Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast Range, and Santa Barbara County.

The loss of California tiger salamander populations has been due primarily to human destruction of habitat and predators, such as American bullfrogs and access to breeding habitats. There is also a viable hybrid between the California tiger salamander and the introduced barred tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium&quot;), which genetic evidence suggests have been hybridizing for 50–60 years.

== Life cycle ==

Adults spend the majority of their lives underground, in burrows created by other animals, such as ground squirrels and gophers; these salamanders are poorly equipped for burrowing. Little is known about their underground life. This underground phase has often been referred to as estivation (the summertime equivalent of hibernation), but true estivation has never been observed, and fiber optic cameras in burrows have allowed researchers to witness salamanders actively foraging. Adults are known to eat earthworms, snails, insects, fish, and even small mammals but adult California tiger salamanders eat very little.

===Reproduction===

Breeding takes place after the first rains in late fall and early winter, when the wet season allows the salamanders to migrate to the nearest pond, a journey that may be as far as a 1.3 miles and take several days. The eggs, which the female lays in small clusters or singly, hatch after 10 to 14 days. The larval period lasts for three to six months. However, California tiger salamander larvae may also &quot;overwinter&quot;. Transformation for overwintering larvae may take 13 months or more. Recent discoveries, such as overwintering, have management implications for this threatened species, particularly when aquatic habitats undergo modification. The larvae feed on other small invertebrates, including tadpoles. When their pond dries, they resorb their gills, develop lungs, and then the metamorphs leave the pond in search of a burrow.

&quot;... the average female bred 1.4 times and produced 8.5 young that survived to metamorphosis per reproductive event, resulting in roughly 12 lifetime metamorphic offspring per female.&quot;

California tiger salamanders can live up to 15 years.

<doc id="791347" wikidata="Q2229669" url="?curid=791347" title="Nesting (process)">
<text>In manufacturing industry, nesting refers to the process of laying out cutting patterns to minimize the raw material waste. Examples include manufacturing parts from flat raw material such as sheet metal, glass sheets, cloth rolls, cutting parts from steel bars, etc.

Such process can also be applied to additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Here the advantages sought can include minimizing tool movement that is not producing product, or maximizing how many pieces can be fabricated in one build session. One difference from nesting of cut pieces is that 3D parts often have a cross section that changes with height, which can cause interference between adjacent parts as they are built up.

==Types==
The nesting process differs for different types of parts:
* 1D nesting - for cutting optimization of one-dimensional parts such as bars, trusses, wires, pipes, rails
* 2D nesting - for cutting optimization of flat parts such as sheet metal, cloth, glass, paper, leather
** nesting of rectangular shapes vs. nesting of multiple freeform 2D shapes (optionally with holes/isles)
** nesting from fixed sheets vs. nesting from infinite rolls
* 3D nesting - for packing optimization of 3D parts such as boxes, shipping containers, 3D printed parts
** nesting/packing of freeform 3D objects

==Process==
To minimize the amount of scrap raw material produced during cutting, companies use nesting software. It automates the calculation of ideal distribution of the cutting patterns to avoid waste. The process involves the analyses the parts (shapes) to be produced at a particular time. Using algorithms, it then determines how to lay these parts out in such a way as to produce the required quantities of parts, while minimizing the amount of raw material (or space) wasted. 

Off-the-shelf nesting software packages address the optimization needs. While some cater only to rectangular nesting, others offer profile or shape nesting where the parts required can be any odd shape. These irregular parts can be created using popular computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Here, the nesting software may be utilized as the connection between CAD drawings and the cut output. 

Most of the profile nesting software can read IGES or DXF profile files automatically, a few of them work with built-in converters. An important consideration in shape nesting is to verify that the software in question actually performs true profile nesting and not just block nesting (rectangular). In block nesting an imaginary rectangle is drawn around the shape and then the rectangles are laid side-by side which actually is not profile nesting. There remains scope for waste reduction.

Nesting software must take into account the limitations and features of the material and machining technology in use, such as:

* Machining cannot take place where the raw material is clamped into place;
* Some machines can access only half of the material at a particular time; the machine automatically flips the sheet over to allow the remaining half to be accessed;
* When punching, the width of the punch tool must be considered;
* Shearing may be permitted only in certain areas of the sheet due to limitations of the machinery (e.g. always across the whole sheet);
* Some cutting technologies (plasma) require some minimal offset between the parts;

Nesting software may also have to take into account material characteristics, such as:

* Defects on material that must be discarded;
* Different quality areas that must match corresponding quality levels required for different parts;
* Direction constraints, that may come from a printed pattern or from fiber direction (graining);
* Front and back sides of the raw material;

Many machine manufacturers offer their own custom nesting software designed to offer ease of use and take full advantage of the features of their specific machines.

If a fabricator operates machines from more than one vendor, they may prefer to use an off-the-shelf nesting software package from a third-party vendor. They then have the potential to run jobs on any available machine, and their staff should not have to learn several different software packages.

<text>Choibalsan (Mongolian: ) is the fourth-largest city in Mongolia after Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, and Erdenet. The name of the city was Bayan Tümen () until 1941, when it was renamed after the communist leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan in honor of the 20th anniversary of the Mongolian Revolution of 1921. It is the capital of the province of Dornod. The city administrative unit&#x27;s official name is Kherlen sum, with area of .
It is situated at the Kherlen River, at an elevation of above sea level.

== History ==

The location has been a post on a trading route for centuries. In the 19th century it grew into a city, and became the economic hub of eastern Mongolia in the twentieth century and is still serving as an active economic center for Eastern Mongolia.

Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to the site of the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, it contains a museum dedicated to Georgy Zhukov, hero of the battle.

== Population ==
The city of Choibalsan has a population of 45,490 (1994), 41,714 (2000), 36,142 (2003), 39,500 (2006), 39,500 (2007, 53.2% of the Dornod Aimag&#x27;s total population), 38,150 (2008 51.2% of the Aimag&#x27;s population).

Choibalsan is inhabited primarily by Halh Mongols, with smaller numbers of Buryats, Barga Mongols, and Üzemchin. There is also a minority of immigrants from China who now constitutes the only China Town in Mongolia outside Ulaanbaatar.

==Climate==
Choibalsan experiences a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with frigid, very dry winters and warm, wetter summers. In terms of temperatures it resembles a humid continental climate (&quot;Dwb&quot;), but falls short of that classification due to the very dry winters. Extreme temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of , recorded in August 2016.

== Transportation ==
The Choibalsan Airport (COQ/ZMCD) has one paved runway, and is served by regular flights to Ulaanbaatar, and Hailar and Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia, China.

There is a railway line (unconnected to the rest of the Mongolian rail network) that connects Choibalsan to the Trans-Siberian Railway (the original routing) in Borzya, Russia; although there are no passenger service across the border: passenger trains from Choibalsan terminate in Chuluunkhoroot (Ereentsav).

<text>Saint-Lazare () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada in the Regional County Municipality of Vaudreuil-Soulanges.

==History==
Originally part of the Seigneurie de Vaudreuil in the 18th century, the territory corresponding to Saint-Lazare was considered difficult to farm owing to sandy soil, and remained mostly uninhabited. In 1812, the first settlers were Americans from New England. Circa 1820, English from Cumberland settled the area, who were followed soon after by French Canadians.

Saint-Lazare was founded as a parish municipality on December 29, 1875. The first church was built in 1877, destroyed by a fire in 1942 and subsequently rebuilt in 1947.

A passenger train from Canadian Pacific Railway previously ran through the town but was discontinued in 1960. The station located on the corner of Sainte-Angélique and Duhamel was demolished.

Originally a rural farming town, the city of Saint-Lazare experienced rapid growth in the 1990s, fueled predominantly by the arrival of young, middle-class families. New residents flocked to the area seeking a more relaxed lifestyle than that of the island of Montreal, as well as larger homes and property for less money than on the island of Montreal.

In December 2001, Saint-Lazare changed its statutes and became a city.

In 2015, the Saint-Lazare government began using pictograms instead of text on signs when the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) asked it to remove its English-language signs; the Saint-Lazare community believes in accommodating bilingualism and its Anglophone residents.

In April 2023, there was a massive power outage that cause approximately 8000 households to lose electricity, according to Hydro-Quebec at that time. Only eight households had electricity at the height of the ice-storm crisis. 

==Communities==

==Soils==

Saint-Lazare was built on thick deposits of sand. Poorly drained areas are most common in the eastern part of town and have been mapped as muck, Peat or Vaudreuil series (a &quot;half-bog&quot; or gleysol), while the well to rapidly drained classic podzols are assigned to Ste.

===Parks===

Saint-Lazare is graced by significant public funding for its ambitious recreational projects. Bedard Park in the centre of the town is a relatively large park equipped with a small water park, a grass field, three baseball diamonds, and tennis courts. In the winter two hockey rinks and an ice skating oval are added. 
Another large, multi-use park is called Le Parc nature les Forestiers de Saint-Lazare (2800 Chemin Lotbinière, Saint-Lazare, QC J7T 3H9). It is a 4-season park, with an outdoor pool, trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, horse riding, and snowshoeing, and picnic areas.

Other parks in Saint-Lazare are scattered among the small subdivisions throughout the municipality.

A new privately-financed sports centre was opened to the public in 2006 which includes an indoor soccer turf, a hockey rink, and a gym.

===Equestrian===
Areas surrounding Saint-Lazare are dedicated to equestrian horse riding, including sanctioned trails that flow through wooded forests and nearby lakes in the region. Many trails are sand based, which is due in part to the popularity of this type of activity in the region. The town has one of the largest populations of horses, approximately 3,500 with many residential properties fully dedicated to breeding and horse training.

===ATV===
All-terrain vehicles are very popular in the region with an officially sanctioned trail, which runs between Saint-Lazare and the nearby town of Rigaud, Quebec. The trail is maintained by regional members of local ATV clubs. The trails are open in all four seasons, and groomed in the winter using heavy machinery.

<text>Darkhan (, ; , ) is the third-largest city in Mongolia and the capital of Darkhan-Uul Aimag.

== History ==
On October 17, 1961, the city of Darkhan was built with extensive economic assistance from the Comecon. As its name implies, the city was originally conceived to be a manufacturing site for Mongolia&#x27;s northern territory. Polish specialists built a woodworking plant, brickworks and a lime factory in Darkhan. Hungarians built a meat factory, opened in 1974.

In 1985, the city housed the tallest building in the country when a 16-story apartment was opened.

The city remains a mostly industrial centre and is the home of some 82% of Darkhan-Uul Province&#x27;s population. As with most urban Mongols, some 86% of the city&#x27;s population live in residential apartments, with the remaining population living in yurts (gers) on the outskirts of the city.

==Geography==
With an elevation of , Darkhan is the capital of the Darkhan-Uul Province. It is a city with notable Soviet influence, evidenced by the huge square buildings and heavy Cyrillic usage. Darkhan is surrounded by mountains and hills, also having some tourist attractions like statues largely being Buddhist attractions. Some parts of the city have wooden houses.

The Kharaa River passes through the western edge of the city.

===Climate===
Darkhan has a borderline humid continental climate (&quot;Dwb&quot;), close to the more typical subarctic climate (&quot;Dwc&quot;) of northern Mongolia, which is found in higher areas near the city, and only marginally wet enough to avoid qualifying as a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). These three climate types tend to overlap a good deal over the border regions of Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan. This area has extremely cold and dry winters; however the summers are warmer and more humid.

==Economy==
The main industry of Darkhan is coal mining. It has also several heavy industries, such as metallurgy, chemical and construction.

== Culture ==

The Kharagiin monastery is housed in a log cabin in the old town; it has recently become active again as a Buddhist monastery.

In addition, the city hosts the Museum of Darkhan-Uul Province. This museum, also called the Traditional Museum of Folk Art, contains a collection of archaeological findings, traditional clothing, religious artifacts, and taxidermy.

The city has a monument to the horse-head fiddle (morin khuur), the national emblematic instrument of Mongols.

== Education ==
Darkhan is the second largest educational center in Mongolia, making the educational level of the city&#x27;s population very high. Hundreds of students come to Darkhan from other parts of Mongolia to study. Currently in Darkhan Uul Aimag there are 10 higher education institutions, 25 secondary schools, 14 kindergartens, the Institute of Management and Development, the Regional Business Development Center and the Plant Science and Agricultural Training Research Institute.

==Politics==

Darkhan houses the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry.

==Infrastructure==

The city is powered by the Darkhan Thermal Power Plant. Waste water is treated at the Darkhan Wastewater Treatment Plant before being discharged to the nearby river. The city is served by the Darkhan General Hospital.

==Tourist attractions==
* My Mongolia Park
* My Mongolia Park Stadium
* Museum of Darkhan-Uul Province

== Transportation ==

Darkhan is served by the Darkhan-1 railway station in the north and Darkhan-2 railway station in the south. Darkhan is connected by four-lane road to Ulaanbaatar for a length of 204 km along the AH3.

In 1966, editor Dick Giordano at Charlton Comics hired him as a comic book artist, where his first assignment was a humorous character called &quot;Miss Bikini Luv&quot; in &quot;Go-Go Comics.&quot;

Over the next few years at Charlton, Aparo drew stories in many genres—Westerns, science fiction, romance, horror, mystery, and suspense. Most of his work was for standalone stories in anthology titles, but he also drew the historical-adventure feature &quot;Thane of Bagarth&quot; in the comic book &quot;Hercules&quot;; the superheroine feature &quot;Nightshade&quot; in &quot;Captain Atom&quot;; the science fiction/Western/comedy backup &quot;Wander&quot; in &quot;Cheyenne Kid&quot;; and the comic book adaptation of the comic strip &quot;The Phantom&quot;.

Aparo was paid $15 to $20 per page at his time at Charlton Comics.

Aparo was one of the few artists in mainstream comics at that time to serve as penciller, inker, and letterer for all of his work.

===DC Comics===
In the late 1960s, Dick Giordano left Charlton for an editorial position at DC Comics and offered Aparo a job drawing the &quot;Aquaman&quot; comic book. After an initial issue (#40) for which Aparo provided only pencil art, Aparo resumed producing pencils, inks, and letters for most issues of the series until its cancellation. Aparo continued for a time to provide art to Charlton for &quot;The Phantom&quot;, alternating between the two series month by month as both series were being released on a bimonthly basis at the time.

Eventually Aparo resigned his assignment on &quot;The Phantom&quot; and worked almost exclusively for the remainder of his career for DC Comics. Aparo&#x27;s next series assignment at DC was &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot;. After Aquaman was cancelled, the bimonthly frequency of &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; was insufficient to fill his typical production rate of one page per day, so DC assigned him several short jobs such as mystery stories for &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and &quot;House of Secrets&quot;.

In 1971, Aparo was assigned a fill-in job as the artist for &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #98 (Oct.–Nov. 1971). This series routinely featured team-ups of DC&#x27;s Batman with other characters, in this case, the Phantom Stranger. As the regular artist on the Phantom Stranger&#x27;s own series, Aparo was considered an appropriate choice. Murray Boltinoff, the editor of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, soon assigned Aparo the regular artistic responsibilities for the series (beginning with #100), which he continued until its cancellation with issue #200, missing only a few issues. Aparo even &quot;co-starred&quot; as himself in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #124 (January 1976).

During the more than 10 years as the artist for &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, its bimonthly frequency permitted Aparo to do many other significant works for DC (it became monthly in Nov. 1978). In addition to numerous covers, he served as the regular artist for a notorious series starring a ruthless avenging ghost called the Spectre, which ran in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, and which in 2005 was collected in a trade paperback edition (). He also provided art for a revival of Aquaman in both &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and a continuation of the previously-cancelled &quot;Aquaman&quot;. He was assigned the solo Batman series in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; as of issue #437 (Oct.–Nov. 1973) for a rather short time and drew occasional stories for anthology series. Aparo and writer Len Wein introduced Sterling Silversmith in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #446 (April 1975). He drew &quot;The Untold Legend of the Batman&quot;, the first Batman miniseries, in 1980, inking John Byrne&#x27;s pencils in the first issue and providing full art for the second and third issues. Aparo was one of the artists on the double-sized &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #200 (March 1982).

When &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; was cancelled in 1983, it was replaced with a series called &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, a superhero team led by Batman. This series, which Aparo co-created with writer Mike W. Barr, would be described by DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz as being &quot;a team series more fashionable to 1980s audiences.&quot; The Masters of Disaster were among the supervillains created by Barr and Aparo for the series. It would run for several years, continuing with a Baxter paper spinoff titled &quot;The Outsiders&quot; that did not include Batman and introduced Looker. For the final few issues, DC began to request that Aparo provide only pencils, and a long and nearly unbroken string of Aparo inking and lettering his own work came mostly to an end.

Aparo&#x27;s next major work consisted of pencils for &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, where his art was almost always inked by Mike DeCarlo. Aparo returned to the &quot;Batman&quot; title with issue #414 (Dec. 1987) in collaboration with writer Jim Starlin. One of their first storylines for the title was &quot;Ten Nights of The Beast&quot; in issues #417–420 (March–June 1988) which introduced the KGBeast. Perhaps the most notable product of this period remains &quot;&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #426–429, 1988–1989), depicting the death of Jason Todd (Robin). The &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; storyline crossed over with &quot;The New Titans&quot; title and introduced Tim Drake as the new Robin. Aparo continued to draw Batman stories in &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; until the early 1990s. During this time, he was the regular artist on &quot;Batman&quot; when Bane broke Bruce Wayne&#x27;s back during the &quot;KnightFall&quot; storyline. In 1992, Aparo returned to do pencils, inks, and lettering for his Batman stories, but was soon returned to contributing only pencil art.

Also that year, Aparo was given his last regular series assignment for DC as pencil artist for &quot;Green Arrow&quot; issues #81–100. He and writer Kelley Puckett co-created Connor Hawke, the son of Green Arrow. Following that assignment, Aparo&#x27;s work appeared infrequently, when Aparo was mostly assigned occasional Batman-related stories and covers in miniseries and specials. His published work in the late 1990s and early 2000s include a &quot;Batman Annual&quot; inked by former Marvel Comics mainstay Sal Buscema, a &quot;G.C.P.D.&quot; miniseries, a &quot;Speed Force Special&quot; featuring the Flash, an issue of a &quot;Deadman&quot; miniseries that revisited his &quot;Death in the Family&quot; story, and a single page of &quot;Green Lantern/Superman: Legend of the Green Flame&quot; written by Neil Gaiman in which he had a final opportunity to draw the Phantom Stranger for publication.

His final work for DC during his life was the cover of the trade paperback &quot;Batman in the Eighties&quot;, published in 2004. In 2006, previously-unpublished Aparo art depicting the unused, alternate ending of the storyline &quot;A Death in the Family,&quot; in which the Jason Todd Robin lives instead of dies, appeared in &quot;Batman Annual&quot; #25.

==Death==
Aparo died on July 19, 2005, at his home in Southington, Connecticut. At least one report attributed the cause of death to &quot;a long battle with cancer&quot;, but his family&#x27;s formal announcement said his death came from &quot;complications relating to a recent illness&quot;. DC Comics ran an Aparo &quot;In Memoriam&quot; page in &quot;Batman&quot; #644 (Oct. 2005) and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #811 (Nov. 2005).

* Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2019

<text>Erdenet (; ) is the second-largest city in Mongolia, with a 2018 population of 98,057, and the capital of the aimag (province) of Orkhon. Located in the northern part of the country, it lies in a valley between the Selenge and Orkhon rivers about (as the crow flies) northwest of Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, the capital. The road length between Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet is about .

==History==
Erdenet, one of the youngest settlements in Mongolia, was founded in 1974 in an area where large deposits of copper had been discovered in the 1950s. A single-track railway line with a length of linking Erdenet to the Trans-Mongolian Railway was inaugurated in 1977. In the middle of the 1980s, more than 50% of the inhabitants were Russians working as engineers or miners. After the fall of Soviet Communism in 1990, however, most Russians left Erdenet. Today, about 10% of the population is Russian.

=== Erdenet Mining Corporation ===

The city hosts the fourth largest copper mine in the world. The Erdenet Mining Corporation is a joint Mongolian-Russian venture, and accounts for a majority of Mongolia&#x27;s hard currency income. Erdenet mines 22.23 million tons of ore per year, producing 126,700 tons of copper and 1,954 tons of molybdenum. The mine accounts for 13.5% of Mongolia&#x27;s GDP and 7% of tax revenue. About 8,000 people are employed in the mine.

==Infrastructure==
Erdenet is linked to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, and to the towns of Darkhan and Bulgan by a paved road and is easily accessible by bus several times each day. The distance to the capital where the nearest airport is situated amounts to and travel by car takes about eight hours. Train connections between Erdenet and Ulaanbaatar are less comfortable as there is only one train per day covering the distance in 11 hours.

==Sights==
*Tourists are allowed to visit the mine by appointment. It is in the eastern part of the city, about from the centre.
*Another important economic factor of Erdenet is the carpet factory about from the center to the east which was founded in 1981. Every year, about 2,000 tons of wool are processed in the factory where about 1,100 people are employed.
*The Mining Museum, in the Culture Palace on the central town square.
*The Museum of Orkhon Province was founded in 1983.
*The Friendship Monument dating from 1984 is on a hill offering a scenic view of the whole city in the northeastern part of Erdenet.
*A new temple with a large Buddha statue was built very recently in the eastern part of Erdenet.
*An amusement park was laid out in the east of the centre.
*Amarbayasgalant Monastery is a Buddhist monastery about northeast of Erdenet. It was founded between 1727 and 1737, partially destroyed by order of Khorloogiin Choibalsan in 1937 and reconstructed after 1975 using financial aid provided by the UNESCO.

==Population==
==Climate==
Erdenet has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;). Summers are typically warm and rainy with cool nights, while winters are long, very cold, and dry.

==Gallery==
== Notable residents ==
* Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, former President of Mongolia
* Oleksandr Zelenskyy, mining engineer and father of Volodymyr Zelenskyy
* Volodymyr Zelenskyy, current President of Ukraine

<text>The International Swimming Hall of Fame and Museum (ISHOF) is a history museum and hall of fame, located at One Hall of Fame Drive, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States, operated by private interests and serving as the central point for the study of the history of swimming in the United States and around the world. Exhibits include ancient art and both reproductions and original art depicting famous moments in swimming history (from ancient times to modern), swimwear, and civil rights, as well as memorabilia and artifacts belonging to persons who have promoted or excelled in aquatics. It is recognized by FINA (&quot;Fédération Internationale de Natation&quot;) as the official hall for the aquatics sports.

==History==
In 1965, Johnny Weissmuller became the president of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, that with this charge in 1970 was present at the Commonwealth Games in Jamaica and was introduced to Queen Elizabeth. ISHOF was incorporated in Florida as a non-profit educational corporation on November 23, 1964, with Buck Dawson, as its first executive director. Nine months later—in August 1965—a 50-meter pool, 25-yard diving well, and warm-up pool were completed. This initial part of the Swimming Hall of Fame complex was dedicated on December 27, 1965, witnessed by 4,500 swimmers and other spectators from all fifty states and eleven foreign countries. In 1968, the then-Swimming Hall of Fame became the first world-recognized hall of fame in any sport, when the 105-nation FINA Congress met at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City and endorsed the hall of fame as an &quot;International Swimming Hall of Fame&quot;. On June 16, 1969, the organization&#x27;s Articles of Incorporation were amended to reflect that the name was changed to &quot;International Swimming Hall of Fame&quot;. The first members of the hall of fame—a class of twenty-one—were inducted in 1965. See the full list of all honorees since 1965

In 2017, the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) merged its operations with &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot;. The combination provided the International Swimming Hall of Fame with an outreach arm, that Swimming World can provide, to the athletes, coaches and volunteers around the world in aquatics. Brent Rutemiller will become the Chief Executive Officer overseeing the merger.

==Mission==
The Hall of Fame&#x27;s mission is to collaborate with aquatic organizations worldwide to preserve, educate and celebrate the history of aquatic sports while promoting Every Child A Swimmer (Tackling the national epidemic of childhood drowning head on, the International Swimming Hall of Fame is a driving force behind nationwide legislation to require swim lessons for all children before they are admitted into kindergarten).

== Vision ==
To be the global focal point for sharing cultures, showcasing events, increasing participation in aquatic sports and developing educational and lesson programs that promote swimming as an essential life-skill. 
== Nominations ==
The Executive Nomination Committee, with the help of ISHOF Staff and the Executive Nomination Committee Chairman oversees the nomination process for the following 9 categories:

* Swimming
* Open Water/Marathon Swimming
* Diving
* Water Polo
* Artistic Swimming (Synchronized Swimming)
* Paralympics
* Coach 
* Contributor (to aquatics)
* Pioneer

(Nominations can be submitted on the ISHOF website.)

<doc id="791382" wikidata="Q7201315" url="?curid=791382" title="Plank road">
<text>A plank road is a road composed of wooden planks or , as an efficient technology for traversing soft, marshy, or otherwise difficult ground. Plank roads have been built since antiquity, and were commonly found in the Canadian province of Ontario as well as the Northeast and Midwest of the United States in the first half of the 19th century. They were often built by turnpike companies.

==Origins==

The Wittmoor bog trackway is the name given to each of two historic plank roads or boardwalks, trackway No. I being discovered in 1898 and trackway No. II in 1904 in the &quot;Wittmoor&quot; bog in northern Hamburg, Germany. The trackways date to the 4th and 7th century AD, both linked the eastern and western shores of the formerly inaccessible, swampy bog. A part of the older trackway No. II dating to the period of the Roman Empire is on display at the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.
This type of plank road is known to have been used as early as 4,000 BC with, for example, the Post Track found in the Somerset levels near Glastonbury, England. This type of road was also constructed in Roman times.

==In North America==
From the mid-1840s and to mid 1850s, the United States experienced the Plank Road Boom and a subsequent bust. The first plank road in the US was built in North Syracuse, New York, to transport salt and other goods; it appears to have copied earlier roads in Canada, which had copied Russian ones. The plank road boom, like many other early technologies, promised to transform the way people lived and worked and led to permissive changes in legislation seeking to spur development, speculative investment by private individuals, etc. Ultimately, the technology failed to live up to its promise, and millions of dollars in investments evaporated almost overnight.

Three plank roads, the Hackensack, the Paterson, and the Newark, were major arteries in northern New Jersey. The roads travelled over the New Jersey Meadowlands, connecting the cities for which they were named to the Hudson River waterfront.

U.S. Route 1 in Virginia follows the Boydton Plank Road from Petersburg southwards to just north of the North Carolina line.

On the U.S. West Coast the Canyon Road of Portland, Oregon was another important but short artery and was built between 1851 and 1856.

Kingston Road (Toronto) (Governor&#x27;s Road) and Danforth Avenue, in Toronto, were plank roads built by the Don and Danforth Plank Road Company in the late 18th and the early 19th centuries. Highway 2 from Toronto eastwards was a plank road in the 19th century that was later paved. In 1833 Scarborough-Markham Plank Road was authorized to build a road from Danforth Road to Highway 7 to Ringwood and east on Stouffville Road to Main Street Stouffville.

Plank roads are used exclusively in the Canadian fishing outport of Harrington Harbour, Quebec because the town is built directly over a hilly, rocky shore. ATVs are the only mode of transportation there.

==In Australia==
In Perth, Western Australia, plank roads were important in the early growth of the agricultural and outer urban areas because of the distances imposed by swamps and the relatively-infertile soil. As it cost £2,000/km to construct roads by conventional means, the local councils, known as road boards, were experimenting with cheaper approaches to road building. A method called Jandakot Corduroy had been developed at Jandakot south-east of Perth: a jarrah tramway lay upon sleepers, bounded by two strips of jarrah planks for cart and carriage wheels. The gap was filled with limestone rubble to be used by horses. This reduced the cost of road building by up to 85% after its widespread introduction in 1908. However, increased traffic and suburban development rendered the routes unsatisfactory over time, and by the 1950s, they had been replaced with bitumen surfaced roads.

<text>Toronto–Danforth (formerly Broadview–Greenwood) is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1979. It lies to the east of Downtown Toronto. Its best-known MP was New Democratic Party (NDP) leader and Leader of the Opposition Jack Layton.

Toronto–Danforth includes an array of ethnicities, including large Greek, Chinese, and South Asian communities, many of the latter of whom are Muslims. It has the highest percentage of ethnic Greeks among all Toronto ridings (7.3%).

Historically, the riding has tilted to the left, particularly since the 1990s. Most election contests take place between the NDP and the Liberal Party. Even with the end of vote-splitting on the centre-right, the Conservatives are almost nonexistent in the riding; no Conservative candidate has crossed the 15 percent mark.

The NDP held the riding for the first nine years of its existence before Liberal Dennis Mills won the seat in 1988 and held it during the long period of Liberal dominance of the federal scene. He was unseated in 2004 by Layton, who had previously run against Mills in 1997. Layton held the seat until his death on August 22, 2011. The seat was vacant until a by-election on March 29, 2012, which was won by NDP candidate and human rights lawyer Craig Scott. However, Scott was narrowly defeated by Liberal Julie Dabrusin in the 2015 election in a major upset.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 63.4% White, 11.2% Chinese, 5.8% South Asian, 5.3% Black, 2.4% Filipino, 2.3% Indigenous, 2.0% Southeast Asian, 1.6% Latin American 
Languages: 65.9% English, 5.4% Cantonese, 3.7% Greek, 2.0% Mandarin, 1.9% French, 1.6% Spanish, 1.0% Tagalog

Religions: 39.5% Christian (16.5% Catholic, 7.8% Christian Orthodox, 3.1% Anglican, 2.3% United Church, 9.8% Other), 4.7% Muslim, 2.7% Buddhist, 2.6% Jewish, 1.1% Hindu, 48.2% none
Median income: $45,600 (2020)
Average income: $70,800 (2020)

==History==

The riding was created in 1976 as &quot;Broadview—Greenwood&quot; from parts of Broadview and York East and a small part of Greenwood.

It consisted initially of the part of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto bounded on the south by Queen Street East, on the west by the Don River, and on the east and north by a line drawn north from Queen Street along Jones Avenue, east along Gerrard Street East, north along Greenwood Avenue, west along O&#x27;Connor Drive, north along Don Mills Road to the Don River.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto and the Borough of East York bounded on the west by the Don River, on the south by Queen Street, and on the east and north by a line drawn from the lake north along Leslie Street, east along Queen Street East, north along Greenwood Avenue, east along Danforth Avenue, north along Coxwell Avenue and Coxwell Boulevard, and west along Taylor Creek and the Don River East Branch to the Don River.

In 1996, it was defined to consist of the parts of the City of Toronto and the Borough of East York north along Leslie Street, east along Queen Street East, north along Greenwood Avenue, east along Gerrard Street East, north along Coxwell Avenue and Coxwell Boulevard, west along Taylor Creek, the Don River East Branch and the Don River, northwest along Millwood Road, southwest along the Canadian Pacific Railway and the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, south along the Don River to Toronto Harbour.

The name of the electoral district was changed in 2000 to &quot;Toronto—Danforth&quot; on the suggestion of Dennis Mills, the riding&#x27;s Member of Parliament. Many local citizens were upset at the name change, particularly because of the lack of public say in the matter. Layton sought neighbourhood input for another name change to the riding, but the name was not changed.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries, which consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by Lake Ontario and Toronto Harbour, on the east by Coxwell Avenue and Coxwell Boulevard, on the north by Taylor Creek and the Don River East Branch, and on the west by the Don River. This riding was unchanged after the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>Anson Northup (possibly &quot;Anson Northrup&quot;) was a sternwheel riverboat named for her captain who was the first to navigate the Red River of the North from Fort Abercrombie, Dakota Territory, to Fort Garry, Rupert&#x27;s Land, departing 6 June and arriving 10 June 1859. Sold and renamed &quot;Pioneer&quot;, she sank during the winter of 1861–62. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was dismantled and her boiler reused by .

The new Anson Northrup is a riverboat that normally offers tours in the Twin Cities area on the Mississippi River. The boat was built in Louisiana and is operated by Padelford Packet Boat Company.

<doc id="791407" wikidata="Q1650639" url="?curid=791407" title="Rosie the Riveter">
<text>Rosie the Riveter is an allegorical cultural icon in the United States who represents the women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II, many of whom produced munitions and war supplies. These women sometimes took entirely new jobs replacing the male workers who joined the military. She is widely recognized in the &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster as a symbol of American feminism and women&#x27;s economic advantage. Similar images of women war workers appeared in other countries such as Britain and Australia. The idea of Rosie the Riveter originated in a song written in 1942 by Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb. Images of women workers were widespread in the media in formats such as government posters, and commercial advertising was heavily used by the government to encourage women to volunteer for wartime service in factories. &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; became the subject and title of a Hollywood film in 1944.

==History==
===Women in the wartime workforce===
Because the world wars were total wars, which required governments to utilize their entire populations to defeat their enemies, millions of women were encouraged to work in the industry and take over jobs previously done by men. During World War I women across the United States were employed in jobs previously done by men. World War II was similar to World War I in that massive conscription of men led to a shortage of available workers and therefore a demand for labor which could be filled only by employing women.

Nearly 19 million women held jobs during World War II. Many of these women were already working in lower-paying jobs or were returning to the work-force after being laid off during the depression. Only three million new female workers entered the workforce during the time of the war.

Women responded to the call of need the country was displaying by stepping up to fill positions that were traditionally filled by men. They began to work heavy construction machinery, taking roles in lumber and steel mills as well as physical labor including unloading freight, building airships, making munitions, and much more. Forty women were hired by Pan American Airways to replace men in the repair and maintenance department in the hangars at LaGuardia airfield for service, repair and overhaul on the fleet of aircraft including the Boeing 314 Flying Boat flying to and from Europe.

Many women discovered they enjoyed the autonomy these jobs provided them with. It expanded their own expectations for womanly duty and capabilities. Unfortunately, this was reckoned as unnatural and as men began to return home from the war, the government instituted another propaganda campaign urging women to &quot;return to normalcy&quot;.
Although most women took on male-dominated trades during World War II, they were expected to return to their everyday housework once men returned from the war. Government campaigns targeting women were addressed solely at housewives, likely because already-employed women would move to the higher-paid &quot;essential&quot; jobs on their own, or perhaps because it was assumed that most would be housewives. One government advertisement asked women: &quot;Can you use an electric mixer? If so, you can learn to operate a drill.&quot; Propaganda was also directed at their husbands, many of whom were unwilling to support such jobs. Many of the women who took jobs during World War II were mothers. Those women with children at home pooled together in their efforts to raise their families. They assembled into groups and shared such chores as cooking, cleaning and washing clothes. Many who did have young children shared apartments and houses so they could save time, money, utilities and food. If they both worked, they worked different shifts so they could take turns babysitting. Taking on a job during World War II made people unsure if they should urge the women to keep acting as full-time mothers, or support them getting jobs to support the country in this time of need.

Over six million women got war jobs; African American, Hispanic, White, and Asian women worked side by side. In the book &quot;A Mouthful of Rivets&quot;, Vi Kirstine Vrooman writes about the time when she decided to take action and become a riveter. She got a job building B-17s on an assembly line, and shares just how exciting it was, saying, &quot;The biggest thrill—I can&#x27;t tell you—was when the B-17s rolled off the assembly line. You can&#x27;t believe the feeling we had. We did it!&quot; Once women accepted the challenge of the workforce they continued to make strong advances towards equal rights.

In 1944, when victory seemed assured for the Allied Forces, government-sponsored propaganda changed by urging women back to working in the home. Later, many women returned to traditional work such as clerical or administration positions, despite their reluctance to re-enter the lower-paying fields. However, some of these women continued working in the factories. The overall percentage of women working fell from 36% to 28% in 1947.

==The song==
 
The term &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; was first used in 1942 in a song of the same name written by Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb. The song was recorded by numerous artists, including the popular big band leader Kay Kyser, and it became a national hit. It was also recorded by the R&amp;B group, The Four Vagabonds. The song portrays &quot;Rosie&quot; as a tireless assembly line worker, who earned a &quot;Production E&quot; doing her part to help the American war effort.

The identity of the &quot;real&quot; Rosie the riveter is debated. Candidates include: 
* Rosina &quot;Rosie&quot; Bonavita who worked for Convair in San Diego, California. 
* Rosalind P. Walter, who &quot;came from old money and worked on the night shift building the F4U Corsair fighter.&quot; Later in life Walter was a philanthropist, a board member of the WNET public television station in New York and an early and long-time supporter of the Charlie Rose interview show.
* Adeline Rose O&#x27;Malley, a riveter at Boeing&#x27;s Wichita plant.
* Rose Will Monroe, a riveter at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, building B-24 bombers for the U.S. Army Air Forces. Born in Pulaski County, Kentucky, in 1920, she moved to Michigan during World War II. The song &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; was already popular when Monroe was selected to portray her in a promotional film about the war effort at home. &quot;Rosie&quot; went on to become perhaps the most widely recognized icon of that era. The films and posters she appeared in were used to encourage women to go to work in support of the war effort. At the age of 50, Monroe realized her dream of flying when she obtained a pilot&#x27;s license. In 1978, she crashed in her small propeller plane when the engine failed during takeoff. The accident resulted in the loss of one kidney and the sight in her left eye, and ended her flying career. She died from kidney failure on May 31, 1997, in Clarksville, Indiana, at the age of 77.

In Canada in 1941, Veronica Foster became &quot;Ronnie, the Bren Gun Girl&quot;, Canada&#x27;s poster girl representing women in the war effort.

A 1944 drama film, &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, borrowed from the Rosie theme and starred Jane Frazee as Rosalind &quot;Rosie&quot; Warren.

==Impact==
===During the Second World War===

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of American Economic History&quot;, &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; inspired a social movement that increased the number of working American women from 12 million to 20 million by 1944, a 57% increase from 1940. By 1944 1.7 million unmarried men between the ages of 20 and 34 worked in the defense industry, while 4.1 million unmarried women between those ages did so.

Although the image of &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; reflected the industrial work of welders and riveters during World War II, the majority of working women filled non-factory positions in every sector of the economy. What unified the experiences of these women was that they proved to themselves (and the country) that they could do a &quot;man&#x27;s job&quot; and could do it well.

In 1942, just between the months of January and July, the estimates of the proportion of jobs that would be &quot;acceptable&quot; for women was raised by employers from 29 to 85%. African American women were some of those most affected by the need for women workers. It has been said that it was the process of whites working alongside blacks during the time that encouraged a breaking down of social barriers and a healthy recognition of diversity.

===Postwar===

Women quickly responded to Rosie the Riveter, who convinced them that they had a patriotic duty to enter the workforce. Some claim that she forever opened the work force for women, but others dispute that point, noting that many women were discharged after the war and their jobs were given to returning servicemen. These critics claim that when peace returned, few women returned to their wartime positions and instead resumed domestic vocations or transferred into sex-typed occupations such as clerical and service work.

For some, World War II represented a major turning point for women as they eagerly supported the war effort, but other historians emphasize that the changes were temporary and that immediately after the war was over, women were expected to return to traditional roles of wives and mothers. A third group has emphasized how the long-range significance of the changes brought about by the war provided the foundation for the contemporary woman&#x27;s movement. Leila J. Rupp, in her study of World War II, wrote &quot;For the first time, the working woman dominated the public image. Women were riveting housewives in slacks, not mother, domestic beings, or civilizers.&quot;

After the war, as the nation shifted to a time of peace, women were quickly laid off from their factory jobs. The &quot;Rosies&quot; and the generations that followed them knew that working in the factories was in fact a possibility for women, even though they did not reenter the job market in such large proportions again until the 1970s. By that time factory employment was in decline all over the country.

Elinor Otto, known as &quot;Last Rosie the Riveter&quot;, built airplanes for 50 years, retiring at age 95.

==Homages==
According to Penny Colman&#x27;s &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, there was also, very briefly, a &quot;Wendy the Welder&quot; based on Janet Doyle, a worker at the Kaiser Richmond Liberty Shipyards in California.

In the 1960s, Hollywood actress Jane Withers gained fame as &quot;Josephine the Plumber&quot;, a character in a long-running and popular series of television commercials for &quot;Comet&quot; cleansing powder that lasted into the 1970s. This character was based on the original &quot;Rosie&quot; character.

One of Carnival Cruise Line&#x27;s ships, the &quot;Carnival Valor&quot;, has a restaurant located on the lido deck named Rosie&#x27;s Restaurant. The restaurant is mostly a tribute to Rosie, but also contains artwork depicting other war-related manufacturing and labor.

In 2010, singer Pink paid tribute to Rosie by dressing as her for a portion of the music video for the song &quot;Raise Your Glass&quot;.

The 2013 picture book &quot;Rosie Revere, Engineer&quot; by Andrea Beaty, features Rosie as &quot;Great Great Aunt Rose&quot; who &quot;Worked building airplanes a long time ago&quot;. She inspires Rosie Revere, the young subject of the book, to continue striving to be a great engineer despite early failures. Rose is shown wielding a walking stick made from riveted aircraft aluminum.

Singer Beyoncé paid tribute to Rosie in July 2014, dressing as the icon and posing in front of a &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; sign often mistaken as part of the Rosie campaign. It garnered over 1.15 million likes, but sparked minor controversy when newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized it.

Other recent cultural references include a &quot;Big Daddy&quot; enemy type called &quot;Rosie&quot; in the video game &quot;BioShock&quot;, armed with a rivet gun. There is a DC Comics character called Rosie the Riveter, who wields a rivet gun as a weapon (first appearing in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 2 No. 176, May 1984). In the video game &quot;Fallout 3&quot; there are billboards featuring &quot;Rosies&quot; assembling atom bombs while drinking Nuka-Cola. Of the female hairstyles available for player characters in the sequel, one is titled &quot;Wendy the Welder&quot; as a pastiche.

Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2, an uncrewed test flight of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station, carried an Anthropomorphic Test Device named &quot;Rosie the Rocketeer.&quot; The device contained fifteen sensors to collect data on the effects of the flight on future passengers.

In 2024, singer Katy Perry paid tribute to Rosie by dressing as her for a portion of the music video for the song &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;.

==Recognition==

&quot;The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter&quot; by Connie Field is a 65-minute documentary from 1980 that tells the story of women&#x27;s entrance into &quot;men&#x27;s work&quot; during WWII. &quot;Rosies of the North&quot; is a 1999 National Film Board of Canada documentary film about Canadian &quot;Rosies,&quot; who built fighter and bomber aircraft at the Canadian Car and Foundry, where Elsie MacGill was also the Chief Aeronautical Engineer.

John Crowley&#x27;s 2009 historical novel &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; covers the wartime industries, and studies the real working conditions of many female industrial workers. &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; is frequently referenced.

On October 14, 2000, the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was opened in Richmond, California, site of four Kaiser Shipyards, where thousands of &quot;Rosies&quot; from around the country worked (although ships at the Kaiser yards were not riveted, but rather welded). Over 200 former Rosies attended the ceremony.

In 2014, Phyllis Gould, one of the original Rosie the Riveters, visited President Barack Obama in support of a National Rosie the Riveter Day; the United States Senate approved the observance on March 21 in 2017. She also pushed for a Gold Medal for Rosies that will be given starting in 2022.

Also in 2014 a nationwide program, run by the organization Thanks! Plain and Simple, was founded to encourage cities to pick a project that &quot;Rosies&quot; can do with younger generations, in order to educate young people about women&#x27;s roles in World War II, and to involve the &quot;Rosies&quot;, many of whom have become isolated as they have gotten older, in community projects.

The name and logo of the Metropolitan Riveters, one of the founding members of the National Women&#x27;s Hockey League, are inspired by the character of Rosie the Riveter.

The Rose City Riveters is the fan club for the Portland Thorns Football Club, a National Women&#x27;s Soccer League team in Portland, Oregon, nicknamed the Rose City. They have taken their inspiration (and their name) from the 30,000 women who worked in the Portland shipyards in Portland during World War II.

===Westinghouse poster===

In 1942, Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller was hired by the Westinghouse Company&#x27;s War Production Coordinating Committee to create a series of posters for the war effort. One of these posters became the famous &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; image, an image that in later years would also be called &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; although it had never been given that title during the war. Miller is thought to have based his &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster on a United Press International wire service photograph taken of a young female war worker, widely but erroneously reported as being a photo of Michigan war worker Geraldine Hoff (later Doyle).

More recent evidence indicates that the formerly misidentified photo is actually of war worker Naomi Parker (later Fraley) taken at Alameda Naval Air Station in California. The &quot;We Can Do It!&quot; poster was displayed only to Westinghouse employees in the Midwest during a two-week period in February 1943, then it disappeared for nearly four decades. During the war, the name &quot;Rosie&quot; was not associated with the image, and the purpose of the poster was not to recruit women workers but to be motivational propaganda aimed at workers of both sexes already employed at Westinghouse. It was only later, in the early 1980s, that the Miller poster was rediscovered and became famous, associated with feminism, and often mistakenly called &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;.

Norman Rockwell&#x27;s image of &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; received mass distribution on the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on Memorial Day, May 29, 1943. Rockwell&#x27;s illustration features a brawny woman taking her lunch break with a rivet gun on her lap and beneath her penny loafer a copy of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s manifesto, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Her lunch box reads &quot;Rosie&quot;; viewers quickly recognized that to be &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; from the familiar song.

Rockwell, America&#x27;s best-known popular illustrator of the day, based the pose of his &#x27;Rosie&#x27; on that of Michelangelo&#x27;s 1509 painting &quot;Prophet Isaiah&quot; from the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Rosie is holding a ham sandwich in her left hand, and her blue overalls are adorned with badges and buttons: a Red Cross blood donor button, a white &quot;V for Victory&quot; button, a Blue Star Mothers pin, an Army-Navy E Service production award pin, two bronze civilian service awards, and her personal identity badge.

Rockwell&#x27;s model was a Vermont resident, 19-year-old Mary Louise Doyle, who was a telephone operator near where Rockwell lived, not a riveter. Rockwell painted his &quot;Rosie&quot; as a larger woman than his model, and he later phoned to apologize. According to two of Doyle&#x27;s obituaries, however, &quot;twenty-four years after Doyle posed, Rockwell sent Doyle a letter calling her the most beautiful woman he&#x27;d ever seen and apologizing for the hefty body in the painting. &#x27;I did have to make you into a sort of a giant,&#x27; he wrote.&quot;

In a post interview, Mary explained that she was actually holding a sandwich while posing for the poster and that the rivet-gun she was holding was fake, she never saw &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and she did have a white handkerchief in her pocket like the picture depicts. The &quot;Post&quot;″s cover image proved hugely popular, and the magazine loaned it to the United States Department of the Treasury for the duration of the war, for use in war bond drives.

After the war, the Rockwell &quot;Rosie&quot; was seen less and less because of a general policy of vigorous copyright protection by the Rockwell estate. In 2002, the original painting sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for nearly $5 million. In June 2009 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, acquired Norman Rockwell&#x27;s iconic Rosie the Riveter painting for its permanent collection from a private collector.

In late 1942, Doyle posed twice for Rockwell&#x27;s photographer, Gene Pelham, as Rockwell preferred to work from still images rather than live models. The first photo was not suitable, because she wore a blouse rather than a blue work shirt. In total, she was paid $10 for her modeling work (). In 1949 she married Robert J. Keefe to become Mary Doyle Keefe. The Keefes were invited and present in 2002 when the Rockwell painting was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s.

In an interview in 2014, Keefe said that she had no idea what impact the painting would have. &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect anything like this, but as the years went on, I realized that the painting was famous,&quot; she said. Keefe died on April 21, 2015, in Connecticut at the age of 92.

<text>Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night is a rock opera by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, released in 2000. The album tells the fictional story of Ludwig van Beethoven on the last night of his life, as the devil, Mephistopheles, comes to collect his soul. With the help of Fate and her son Twist, Beethoven unwittingly tricks the devil and is allowed to keep his soul which he had thought lost, but that the devil had no claim on. The opera features many classical crossover rock songs which are clearly based on melodies from classical music, particularly Beethoven&#x27;s works. It is the first Trans-Siberian Orchestra album that does not feature Christmas themes. The original cover art was created by Edgar Jerins, and re-issued cover art was created by Greg Hildebrandt.

== Story ==
Late one night in the spring of 1827 (presumably March 26, the night he died), Ludwig van Beethoven has completed his masterpiece, his tenth symphony (which, in reality, was never completed).

Just as this work is finished, Fate and her deformed son Twist (as in &#x27;Twist of Fate&#x27;) arrive in the composer&#x27;s home, and inform him of what he had expected for a long while: that this night was the night of his death.

After this explanation, the devil Mephistopheles arrives to claim Beethoven&#x27;s soul. He offers the composer a deal; Mephistopheles will allow Beethoven to keep his soul if he may erase the memory of Beethoven&#x27;s works from all mankind. Beethoven is given one hour to consider, and Mephistopheles leaves the room.

Beethoven turns his anger to Fate at having been dealt a hard life, and now, this decision. In consolation, Fate allows Beethoven to travel back through his life in order to review it and make any changes that he wishes. Beethoven accepts this, and they begin with Beethoven&#x27;s experiences as a child.

Beethoven comes into his room while the young Beethoven has just been slapped by a tutor for failing to receive appointment to the Imperial Court. Beethoven turns to Fate and informs her that he did not need the hardships that he had faced, with his mother dead and a painful childhood. He requests that she remove the experience from his life. After being told that such a request would remove the inspiration for his sixth symphony, he changes his mind.

Fate and Beethoven then go to one of Beethoven&#x27;s happier moments, meeting the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the city of Vienna. Fate then reminds Beethoven of his &quot;immortal beloved&quot; Theresa, and after experiencing a fond remembrance, Beethoven explains his reasons for needing to leave her.

The pair venture to when Beethoven first realizes his deafness, and Beethoven explains that Theresa would not love him were she to know. He is then shown Theresa&#x27;s reaction to his unexplained absence, and he realizes that his deafness is the cause of all his problems. Fate explains that if she cures his deafness, his music will suffer, as the Muses would not be heard as easily through the everyday sound. He thus withdraws his request.

Beethoven is then shown that Theresa would have loved him forever, and he becomes very sorrowful. But Fate then offers visions of the countless musicians of the future who would be influenced by Beethoven&#x27;s works. As one last, ultimate vision, he is allowed to improvise with the musicians of the past and future who were inspired by him. Realizing that removing the hardships from his life would destroy his music, Beethoven informs Fate that he will not change any part of his life.

At this point, Mephistopheles returns and Beethoven informs the devil that he will not allow his music to be destroyed. Desperate to receive the Tenth Symphony, Mephistopheles makes another deal: if Beethoven will give over only the Tenth Symphony, then Mephistopheles will not take the composer&#x27;s soul. After an appearance by Mozart&#x27;s ghost, Beethoven refuses this offer as well. As a final tactic, Mephistopheles points out the window to a young orphan, and describes the tortures that she will receive if Beethoven refuses to hand over his music. Heartbroken, Beethoven agrees to hand over his Tenth Symphony. After Twist&#x27;s prompting, a contract is drawn up by Fate, stating the following:

&quot;It is agreed upon this night, March 26, 1827, between the undersigned, that the music of the Tenth Symphony, composed by Ludwig van Beethoven, first born son of Johann and Maria van Beethoven, of the city of Bonn, shall henceforth be the property of Mephistopheles, Lord of Darkness and first fallen from the grace of God. It is also understood that it is his intention to remove any signs of this music from the memory of man for all eternity. In exchange for the destruction of the aforementioned music it is also agreed that Mephistopheles and all his minions will remove themselves from the life of the child presently sleeping in the gutter directly across from the window of this room. This removal of influence is to be commenced immediately upon signing and to be enforced for all eternity.&quot;

_____________________
&quot;Ludwig van Beethoven&quot;

_____________________
&quot;Mephistopheles&quot;

The contract is signed by both the parties, after which Mephistopheles thrusts the Tenth Symphony over a lit candle. When it does not burn, the fact is revealed that Beethoven is in fact the &quot;second&quot;-born son of his parents by the name Ludwig van Beethoven, and thus, the contract does not apply to his music.

After Mephistopheles leaves in a fit of rage, it is revealed that the true destination of Beethoven&#x27;s soul is actually heaven (as Twist explains, the devil was simply lying to him all along). Fate tells him to rest, and Beethoven&#x27;s soul leaves his body for the great beyond. However, Twist also hides the manuscript for the tenth symphony.

<doc id="791417" wikidata="Q842323" url="?curid=791417" title="Khalkha Mongols">
<text>The Khalkha (; ) have been the largest subgroup of the Mongols in modern Mongolia since the 15th century. The Khalkha, together with Chahars, Ordos and Tumed, were directly ruled by Borjigin khans until the 20th century; unlike the Oirats, who were ruled by Dzungar nobles or the Khorchins, who were ruled by Qasar&#x27;s descendants.

The two original major Khalkha groups were ruled by the direct male line descendants of Dayan Khan. The Baarin, Khongirad, Jaruud, Bayaud and the O&#x27;zeed (Ujeed) became Dayan Khan&#x27;s fifth son Achibolod&#x27;s subjects, thus formed the Southern Five Halhs. Seven northern Khalkha otogs: 1) Jalairs, Olkhonud; 2) Besut, Iljigin; 3) Gorlos, Keregut; 4) Khuree, Khoroo, Tsookhor; 5) Khukhuid, Khatagin; 6) Tanghut, Sartuul; 7) Uriankhai became Dayan Khan&#x27;s youngest (could be third) son Geresenje&#x27;s () subjects. Khotogoids are close in culture and language to the Khalkha Mongols.

There were also numerous direct descendants of Genghis Khan who had formed the ruling class of the Khalkha Mongols prior to the 20th century, but they were and still also regarded as Khalkha Mongols rather than belonging to a special unit.

The Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North are the major subethnic group of the independent state of Mongolia. They number 2,659,985 (83.8% of Mongolia&#x27;s population).

The Khalkha or Halh dialect is the standard written language of Mongolia.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;Халх&quot; (&quot;Halh, Khalkha&quot;) has always puzzled linguists and historians. One possible interpretation is that it shares the same root as the words xалхавч &quot;shield&quot; and халхлах &quot;to protect; to cover; to shield; to hide; to intercept&quot;, although there is no noun or verb &quot;xалх&quot; that independently exists besides the ethnic group&#x27;s name. In a similar manner, the sub-ethnic groups within the Khalkha Unit have been historically recorded in books, journals, and documents as &quot;Sartuul Khalkha&quot;, &quot;Tanghut Khalkha&quot; etc. Even the word order in the phrases Southern Five Khalkha and Northern Thirteen Khalkha implies that the word Халх correlates to the units within the Southern and Northern tribal federations, but it does not stand for the group as a whole. Lastly, Mongolians have always linked the term Халх to the name of the Khalkhyn Gol.

== History ==
Dayan Khan created the Khalkha Tumen out of Mongols residing in the territory of present-day central Mongolia and northern part of Inner Mongolia. In Mongolian historical sources such as &quot;Erdeniin Erih&quot; (&quot;The Beads of Jewel&quot;) it clearly stated how the Khalkha Tumen was created and where these people resided at the time of its creation. The statement goes as follows:

*Transliteration:
:&quot;Hangai Khand nutuglan suuj&quot;
:&quot;Hari daisind chinu Khalkha bolson&quot;
:&quot;Haluun amind chinu Tushee bolson&quot;
:&quot;Irehiin uzuur, Harahiin haruul bolson&quot;
:&quot;Khalkha tumen chinu Ter bukhii beer ajaamuu&quot;

*Cyrillic:
:Хангай ханд нутаглан сууж
:Харь дайсанд чинь халх болсон
:Халуун аминд чинь түшээ болсон
:Ирэхийн үзүүр, харахын харуул болсон
:Халх түмэн чинь тэр бүхий бээр ажаамуу

*Mongolian script

*English translation:
:&quot;Dwelling in the Hangai Mountains&quot; (Central Mongolian Mountain range called Hangai Mountain Range, near which Harakorum, the ancient capital, was built)
:&quot;A shield (in Mongolian, &quot;khalkha&quot; means &quot;shield&quot; or &quot;protection&quot;) against alien enemies&quot;
:&quot;A support for your precious life&quot;
:&quot;A blade towards those who come, a guard towards those who look&quot;
:&quot;Your Khalkha Tumen is indeed for you&quot;

It is also believed that the Southern Khalkha who now reside in Inner Mongolia were moved south from its original territory Khangai Mountains. To commemorate and signify their origin, every new lunar year all southern Khalkhas perform special Khangai Mountain worshipping ceremonies and they face northwest and pray. This special ceremony is maintained by only southern Khalkhas and no other Southern Mongols have such rituals.

Under Dayan Khan, the Khalkha were organized as one of three tümen of the Left Wing. Dayan Khan installed the fifth son Alchu Bolad and the eleventh son Geresenje on the Khalkha. The former became the founder of the Five Halh of Southern Mongolia and the latter became the founder of the Seven Halh of the Northern Mongolia. They were called Inner Khalkha and Outer Khalkha respectively, by the Manchus.

Some scholars consider that the Halh had a close connection with the Five Ulus of the Left Wing of the former Yuan dynasty, which was led by the five powerful tribes of Jalayir, Onggirat, Ikires, Uruud and Mangghud.
The Five Halh consisted of five tribes called Jarud, Baarin, Onggirat, Bayaud and Öjiyed. They lived around the Shira Mören valley east of the Greater Khingan. They clashed with but were eventually conquered by the rising Manchus. The Five Khalkha except for the Jarud and the Baarin were organized into the Eight Banners. Khalkha Left Banner of Juu Uda League and Khalkha Right Banner of Ulaanchab League were offshoots of the Seven Khalkha.
The Seven Khalkha were involved in regular fights against the Oyirad in the west. Geresenje&#x27;s descendants formed the houses of Tüsheet Khan, Zasagt Khan and Setsen Khan. They preserved their independence until they had to seek help from the Kangxi Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty against the Zungar leader Galdan in 1688. In 1725 the Yongzheng Emperor gave Tsering independence from the house of Tüsheet Khan, forming the house of Sain Noyon Khan.

The Khalkha led the Mongolian independence movement in the 20th century. After enduring countless hardships, they established the independent state of Mongolia in northern Mongolia.

==Khalkha diaspora==
The overwhelming majority of Khalkha Mongols now reside in the modern state of Mongolia. However, there are four small banners in China: two in Inner Mongolia; one in Qinghai; and one in Rehe. There are also several groups among the Buriats in Russia, however, they no longer retain the Khalkha self-identity, culture, and language. The Halh Mongols in Qinghai, China and the ones among the Buryats in Russia were subjects to Khalkha&#x27;s Tsogtu Khan and his sons.

The Choghtu Khong Tayiji&#x27;s Khalkhas (1 banner): Poet, supporter of Ligdan Khan, and opponent of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Hat&quot; order, Tsogtu Khong Taiji moved to Qinghai with his subjects sometime after 1624. Ligdan Khan and Tsogtu Khong Taiji were supposed to meet in Qinghai and eventually build a Mongol base that is independent of the Manchu rule which was geographically far from the Manchu emperor&#x27;s reach. Moreover, it was clear to the two Mongol Khans that Tibetan Dalai Lama&#x27;s influence in Mongol affairs was increasing. So the two decided to end the influence of Dalai Lama and the &quot;Yellow Hat&quot; order by supporting the &quot;Red Hat&quot; order. However, majority of Ligdan Khan&#x27;s subjects and soldiers died because of smallpox on the way to Qinghai. After Ligdan&#x27;s death, Tsogtu Taiji began attacking dGe-lugs-pa monasteries. When Tsogtu sent 10,000 men under his son Arslang against the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, Arslang switched sides and supported the Dalai Lama. The dGe-lugs-pa hierarch, the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–82), summoned the Oirat Güshi Khan Toro-Baiku, whose 10,000 men in early 1637 crushed Tsogtu’s 30,000 at Ulaan-Khoshuu; Tsogtu Taiji was killed. Today the Oirats of Gushi Khan is also known as the &quot;Upper Mongols&quot; or the &quot;ДЭЭД МОНГОЛ&quot;, and they still reside in Qinghai forming 21 banners. The remnants of Tsogtu Khong Taiji&#x27;s Halhs form only one banner and are known as the &quot;Lower Mongols&quot; or &quot;ДООД МОНГОЛ&quot;. Tsogtu Khong Taiji is known as Tsogtu Khan among the Khalkha Mongols in Qinghai.

The Khalkha Right Wing Banner: This banner was popularly known as the Darkhan Beili Banner and the ruler of this banner was the descendant of Gersenz Jalair Khan&#x27;s grandson Bunidari. In 1653 they migrated into Inner Mongolia from the Tusheet Khan Aimak of Outer Mongolia.

The Khalkha East Wing Banner: This banner was popularly known as the &quot;Chokhor Halh&quot; and the ruler of this banner was the descendant of Gombo-Ilden, the fifth generation grandson to Gersenz Jalair Khan. They fled from the Zasakto Khan Aimak of Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia in 1664. Its boundaries as given by the Mongol Pastures run 125 by 230 &quot;li&quot;, or about .

The Tanggot Khalkha Banner: This Banner formerly subordinated for administrative purposes to the East Wing Tumet (Monggoljin) Banner, is popularly known as Tanggot Khalkha. This tiny territory, of not more than , is said to have a population of about 500 people. There are practically no Chinese, as the surrounding districts are held by Mongols. The tribe, which has a prince of its own, was founded by immigrants from the Jasakto Khan division of Outer Mongolia, who fled to Inner Mongolia and offered submission to the Manchus in 1662, during the wars between the Northern (Khalkha) and Western (Ulot) Mongols.

== Loss of Khalkha territory to Imperial Russia and the Buriatized Khalkhas ==

During the rise of Genghis Khan in the 12th to 13th centuries, neither the Selenge valley in today&#x27;s southern Buriatia or the Aga steppe had at this time any connection with the Buriats; these were the lands of the Merkid tribe and the Mongol tribe proper. Starting 1628 with the Russian Conquest and Buriat Migration, the Selenge Valley, as before, was inhabited by Mongol clans under the rule of the Khalkha khans. By 1652 the Khalkha khans were protesting the Russian incursions into Transbaikalia, and from 1666 on Khalkha raiding parties reached as far as Bratsk, Ilimsk, Yeravninsk, and Nerchinsk, while the khans besieged the forts on the Selenge. At the same time, however, the Khoris along the Uda River in 1647 surrendered as a block to the Russians to escape paying tribute to the Khalkhas. Smaller Mongol clan fragments also defected north to the protection of Cossack forts. The invasion of Khalkha by Galdan Boshogtu Khan in 1688 stopped Khalkha resistance to the Cossack advance and sent more Mongol refugees fleeing into Russian control.

Finally, the Selenge Mongols, cut off by the new border from their Khalkha kinsmen and mixed with displaced Buriats and Khori, gradually accepted the Russian designation as Buriat. These groups are: Descendants of Okhin Taij (grandson of Khalkha&#x27;s Tsogtu Khan); Khatagin; Atagan; Ashabagad; Sartuul; Tavnanguud; Yungsiebu; O&#x27;zeed; Uuld; Tsongool. The Tsongool subclans are as follows: 1. Uriankhad, 2. Bolingud, 3. Baatud, 4. Ashibagad, 5. Avgachuud, 6. Sharnuud, 7. Nomkhod, 8. Khamnigan, 9. Arshaantan, 10. Khorchid, 11. Naimantan, 12. Yunshööbü, 13. Khotgoid, 14. Eljiged, 15. Örlüüd, 16. Tavnanguud, 17. Orongoi, 18. Tsookhor, 19. Sartuul, 20. Sharaid, 21. Temdegten.

Mongolian academician, writer, and scholar Byambyn Renchin () is a representative of this ethnic group. His father belonged to the Yungshiebu tribe and his mother was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan through Khalkha&#x27;s Tsogtu Khan.

<text>The University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) is a hospital in the University District of Seattle, Washington. It is one of the teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Washington School of Medicine and is located in the Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Center.

The UWMC opened on May 5, 1959, and became home to the world&#x27;s first pain center and also the world&#x27;s first long-term kidney dialysis which was developed by UW professor Belding H. Scribner, M.D.

The 2007 issue of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Best Hospitals&quot; ranked the UWMC 10th out of 5,000 hospitals nationwide. According to the report, several UWMC programs scored highly in specialty rankings, including primary care, rehabilitation medicine, and neurology/neurosurgery.

In 2012, UWMC added the eight-story, $210 million Montlake Tower which expanded its capacity to more than 570 patient beds. In May 2013, it was announced that UW Medicine, which owns and operates the UWMC, and PeaceHealth would join forces with one another in a &quot;strategic affiliation.&quot; The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the merger, due to PeaceHealth being &quot;directed by the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives.&quot;

<text>The Hollywood Reporter (THR) is an American digital and print magazine which focuses on the Hollywood film, television, and entertainment industries. It was founded in 1930 as a daily trade paper, and in 2010 switched to a weekly large-format print magazine with a revamped website. As of 2020, the day-to-day operations of the company are handled by Penske Media Corporation through a joint venture with Eldridge Industries. The magazine also sponsors and hosts major industry events. 

==History==
===Foundation and early years ===
&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; was founded in 1930 by William R. &quot;Billy&quot; Wilkerson (1890–1962) as Hollywood&#x27;s first daily entertainment trade newspaper. The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930, and featured Wilkerson&#x27;s front-page &quot;Tradeviews&quot; column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday-to-Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday-to-Friday from 1940. Wilkerson used caustic articles and gossip to generate publicity and was noticed by the studio bosses in New York and some studio lots tried to ban the paper.

In 1932, &quot;Variety&quot; sued &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, alleging that &quot;THR&quot; was plagiarizing information from &quot;Variety&quot; following its publication in New York on Tuesdays, by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood, so that &quot;THR&quot; could publish the information before &quot;Variety&quot; reached Hollywood three days later on Friday. Then, in 1933, &quot;Variety&quot; started its own daily Hollywood edition, &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, to cover the film industry.

Screenwriter and ardent anti-Communist Jack Moffitt, who had written the scripts for dozens of films during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age and was the father of model and actress Peggy Moffitt, wrote many reviews for &quot;THR&quot; after being hired by Wilkerson in 1955.

Wilkerson became friends with Howard Hughes and the paper wrote many favorable stories about him and his film plans. In return, Hughes, in addition to advertising revenue, also provided financial assistance to the paper when necessary.

Wilkerson ran &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior. Wilkerson&#x27;s wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.

====Hollywood blacklist====

From the late 1930s, Wilkerson used &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers&#x27; trade union, the Screen Writers Guild, which he called the &quot;Red Beachhead&quot;. In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors&#x27; Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his &quot;Tradeviews&quot; column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined &quot;A Vote for Joe Stalin.&quot; He went to confession before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.

The column contained the first industry names, including Dalton Trumbo and Howard Koch, on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as &quot;Billy&#x27;s list&quot;. Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; who were blacklisted after hearings in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee. When Wilkerson died in 1962, his &quot;THR&quot; obituary said that he had &quot;named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production.&quot;

In 1997 &quot;THR&quot; reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper&#x27;s involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist&#x27;s 65th anniversary in 2012, the &quot;THR&quot; published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson&#x27;s role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller. The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson&#x27;s son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.

===1988–2008; BPI Communications===

On April 11, 1988, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel sold the paper to BPI Communications, owned by Affiliated Publications, for $26.7 million. Robert J. Dowling became &quot;THR&quot; president in 1988, and editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991. Dowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990. Block and Teri Ritzer damped much of the sensationalism and cronyism that was prominent in the paper under the Wilkersons. In 1994, BPI Communications was sold to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU) for $220 million.

In March 2006 a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired &quot;THR&quot; along with the other assets of VNU. It joined those publications with &quot;AdWeek&quot; and A.C. Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company.

Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. &quot;The Reporter&quot; absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at &quot;Variety&quot; in March 2007. Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16 years with the paper.

From 1988 to 2014, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; were both located on Wilshire Boulevard, along Miracle Mile. In March 2007, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; surpassed &quot;Daily Variety&quot; to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.

===2009–2010: Prometheus Global ownership===
In December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners, and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal &quot;The Hill&quot;, acquired &quot;THR&quot; from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. Richard Beckman, formerly of Condé Nast, was appointed as CEO.

In 2010, Beckman recruited Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, as editorial director to &quot;eviscerate&quot; the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, &quot;The New York Times&quot; took note of the many scoops &quot;THR&quot; had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its &quot;rarefied demographic&quot;, stating: &quot;They managed to change the subject by going weekly... The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, a property of Penske Media Corporation, sued &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; for more than $5 million, alleging copyright infringement. In 2013, &quot;THR&quot;″s parent company settled the suit. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: &#x27;Prometheus admits that &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; copied source code from Penske Media Corporation&#x27;s Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; have apologized to Penske Media.

By February 2013 the &quot;Times&quot; returned to &quot;THR&quot;, filing a report on a party for Academy Award nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant Spago. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the &quot;Times&quot; alluded to the fact that many Hollywood insiders were now referring to &quot;THR&quot; as &quot;the new &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;&quot;. Ad sales since Min&#x27;s hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine&#x27;s website had grown by 800%.

In January 2014, Janice Min was promoted to President/Chief Creative Officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media, giving her oversight of &quot;THR&quot; and its sister brand &quot;Billboard&quot;. Min is joined by co-president John Amato, who is responsible for business initiatives.

Guggenheim Partners announced on December 17, 2015, that it would sell the Prometheus media properties to its executive Todd Boehly. The company was sold to Eldridge Industries in February 2017. On February 1, 2018, Eldridge Industries announced the merger of its media properties with Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media (later rebranded in 2020 as simply MRC).

In February 2017, Min announced she was stepping down from her role as President/Chief Creative Officer overseeing &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; to take on a new role at its parent company. Simultaneously, it was announced that longtime executive editor Matthew Belloni would take over as editorial director.

===2020–present: PMC joint venture (PMRC)===

In April 2020, Belloni announced he was stepping down after 14 years at the publication in the wake of recent clashes with the company&#x27;s leadership over editorial issues. At the end of April 2020, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (THR) named Nekesa Mumbi Moody as the editorial director who was expected to begin on June 15, 2020.

In September 2020, Penske Media assumed the day-to-day operations of &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; through a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC. The agreement also included opportunities for MRC to develop content based on PMC&#x27;s publications.

Established in 2020, PMRC is the parent company of THR, &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, Music Business Worldwide, the annual Life is Beautiful music festival and an investment in the SXSW festival franchise that is expanding beyond its Austin, Texas roots next year with an edition in Sydney, Australia.

In April 2020, at least 20 staffers were laid off, including executive vice president and group publisher Lynne Segall.

On August 5, 2022, Boehly pulled out of the MRC joint venture, and bought back the assets he had contributed to it, including &quot;The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1235334769&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

In June 2023, digital media writer J. Clara Chan and at least two other staffers were laid off. A year later &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; laid off a small number of editorial workers, including senior editor of diversity and inclusion Rebecca Sun and longtime TV editor Lesley Goldberg, who has been with the outlet since 2003.

==Publishers==
Founder Billy Wilkerson served as the publisher of &quot;THR&quot; until his death in September 1962. Wilkerson&#x27;s wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.

Robert J. Dowling, who was named president of &quot;THR&quot; when Kassel sold the company, became editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.

Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005.

==Editions==

===Website===
The &quot;Reporter&quot; published a primitive &quot;satellite&quot; digital edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995. Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor &quot;Variety&quot; took to the web in 1998. In 2002 the &quot;Reporter&quot;″s website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.

THR.com, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. The website includes a blog called &quot;Heat Vision&quot;, which covers comic books, science fiction, and horror content. As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.

==Editors and reporters==

&quot;THR&quot;″s editors have included Janice Min (2010–2017), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001), and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).

Alex Ben Block was hired as editor for special issues in 1990, and was promoted to editor of the daily edition in 1992. After Block left, former &quot;Variety&quot; film editor, Anita Busch, became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with &quot;Variety&quot;.

In March 2006, Cynthia Littleton, former broadcast television editor and deputy editor, was named editor, but left the role a year later for an editorial job at &quot;Variety&quot;. In July 2007 &quot;THR&quot; named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of &quot;Variety&quot;, where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. Guider left &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in early 2010.

In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the &quot;Reporter&quot; hired the following staff in 2007:
* Todd Cunningham, former assistant managing editor of the &quot;LA Business Journal&quot;, as National Editor for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;: Premier Edition
* Steven Zeitchik as Senior Writer, based in New York, where he provide news analysis and features for the Premiere Edition
* Melissa Grego, former managing editor of &quot;TV Week&quot;, as Editor of HollywoodReporter.com
* Jonathan Landreth as the new Asian bureau chief, in addition to 13 new writers across Asia

However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and its sister publications: &quot;Adweek&quot;, &quot;Brandweek&quot;, &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; and &quot;Mediaweek&quot;. In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper. In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;, and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at Knox College. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, &quot;Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group.&quot;

Staffing at &quot;THR&quot; in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with &quot;names from today&#x27;s tragic bloodletting of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s staff&quot; adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008. &quot;The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor Hy Hollinger, plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead.&quot;

Gossip blogger Roger Friedman joined &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; as a senior correspondent in May 2009, a year after being fired by Fox News for writing an article reviewing an illegally bootlegged copy of the movie &quot;Wolverine&quot;. &quot;Business Insider&quot; described it as a surprising and risky move. In March 2010, Friedman&#x27;s employment agreement was not renewed by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

When Janice Min and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably &quot;Variety&quot; film critic Todd McCarthy after his firing from &quot;Variety&quot; in March 2010, as well as Kim Masters of NPR, Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Lacey Rose of &quot;Forbes&quot;, Pamela McClintock of &quot;Variety&quot; and Eriq Gardner of American Lawyer.

==Sponsorship, events, and shows==

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; sponsors and hosts a number of major industry events and awards ceremonies. It hosted 13 such events in 2012, including the Women in Entertainment Breakfast, where it announced its annual Power 100 list of the industry&#x27;s most powerful women; the Key Art Awards (for achievement in entertainment advertising and communications); Power Lawyers Breakfast; Next Gen (honoring the industry&#x27;s 50 fastest-rising stars and executives age 35 and under); Nominees Night; and the 25 Most Powerful Stylists Luncheon.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has produced the group interview shows &quot;Close Up with The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Off Script with The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

== Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot ==

Since 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has published an annual feature called &quot;Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot&quot; where anonymous members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences explain their voting choices for the Academy Awards (Oscars). The feature was first published in February 2013 as a single interview with an anonymous director titled &quot;An Oscar Voter&#x27;s Brutally Honest Ballot&quot;. The magazine typically publishes three to four interviews each year. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the feature &quot;the best part of Oscar season&quot;.

In April 2023, the Academy introduced a rule change aimed at curtailing the feature, saying that Academy voters &quot;may not discuss [their] voting preferences and other members&#x27; voting preferences in a public forum. This includes comparing or ranking motion pictures, performances, or achievements in relation to voting. This also includes speaking with press anonymously.&quot;

== International editions ==

Concita De Gregorio was appointed as the magazine&#x27;s first chairman, and served in the role until February 2024, being subsequently replaced by Boris Sollazzo. Since March of the same year, the writing staff of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter Roma&quot; publicly denounced the state of financial crisis affecting the magazine, with journalists, translators and external contributors reportedly not getting paid for months; an &quot;Il Post&quot; inquiry revealed a significant discrepancy between Brainstore Media&#x27;s declared budget and the original financial plan presented by the company to PMRC in the &quot;due diligence&quot; phase. On 1 July, Sollazzo and the rest of the writing staff officially resigned from their jobs at the magazine.

The Hollywood Reporter India was launched in 2024 in India. The Indian edition of The Hollywood Reporter has been launched under a licensing agreement between Penske Media Corporation and RPSG Lifestyle Media. Anupama Chopra has been appointed as the Editor of The Hollywood Reporter India.

<text>The Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), officially known as Walter Reed General Hospital (WRGH) until 1951, was the U.S. Army&#x27;s flagship medical center from 1909 to 2011. Located on in Washington, D.C., it served more than 150,000 active and retired personnel from all branches of the United States Armed Forces. The center was named after Walter Reed, a U.S. Army physician and Major who led the team that confirmed that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct physical contact.

Since its origins, medical care at the facility grew from a bed capacity of 80 patients to approximately 5,500 rooms covering more than of floor space. WRAMC combined with the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Maryland in 2011 to form the tri-service Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). The grounds and historic buildings of the old campus are being redeveloped as The Parks at Walter Reed.

==History==

===Origins at Fort McNair===
Fort Lesley J. McNair, located in the southwest of the District of Columbia on land set aside by George Washington as a military reservation, is the third oldest U.S. Army installation in continuous use in the United States after West Point and Carlisle Barracks. Its position at the confluence of the Anacostia River and the Potomac River made it an excellent site for the defense of the nation&#x27;s capital. Dating back to 1791, the post served as an arsenal, played an important role in the nation&#x27;s defense, and housed the first U.S. Federal Penitentiary from 1839 to 1862.

Today, Fort McNair enjoys a strong tradition as the intellectual headquarters for defense. Furthermore, with unparalleled vistas of the picturesque waterfront and the opposing Virginia shoreline, the historic health clinic at Fort McNair, the precursor of today&#x27;s Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), overlooks the residences of top officials who choose the famed facility for the delivery of their health care needs.

&quot;Walter Reed&#x27;s Clinic,&quot; the location of the present day health clinic at Washington, D.C., occupies what was from 1898 until 1909 the General Hospital at what was then Washington Barracks, long before the post was renamed in honor of Lt. Gen. McNair who was killed in 1944. The hospital served as the forerunner of Walter Reed General Hospital; however, the Victorian era waterfront dispensary remains and is perhaps one of America&#x27;s most historically significant military medical treatment facilities. It is reported that Walter Reed lived and worked in the facility when he was assigned as Camp Surgeon from 1881 to 1882. After having served on other assignments, he returned as Professor of Medicine and Curator of the Army Medical Museum. Some of his epidemiological work included studies at Washington Barracks, and he is best known for discovering the transmission of yellow fever. In 1902, Major Reed underwent emergency surgery here for appendicitis and died of complications in this U.S. Army Medical Treatment Facility (MTF), within the very walls of what became his final military duty assignment.

Regarding the structure itself, since the 1890s the health clinic was used as an Army General Hospital where physicians, corpsmen and nurses were trained in military health care. In 1899, the morgue was constructed which now houses the Dental Clinic, and in 1901 the hospital became an entirely separate command. This new organizational command relocated eight years later with the aide of horse-drawn wagons and an experimental steam driven ambulance in 1909. Departing from the 50-bed hospital, as documented in The Army Nursing Newsletter, Volume 99, Issue 2, February 2000, they set out due north transporting with them 11 patients initially to the new 65-bed facility in the northern aspect of the capital. Having departed Ft. McNair, the organization has since developed into the Walter Reed Army Medical Center that we know today.

As for the facility they left behind at Fort McNair, it functioned in a smaller role as a post hospital until 1911 when the west wing was converted into a clinic.

===Walter Reed General Hospital and WRAMC===
Congressional legislation appropriated $192,000 for the construction of Walter Reed General Hospital (WRGH, now known as &quot;Building 1&quot;). The firm of Marah &amp; Peter did the architectural designs, and Cramp &amp; Company was awarded the construction contract. was the Construction began in 1907. The first ten patients were admitted on 1 May 1909. Lieutenant Colonel William Cline Borden was the initiator, planner and effective mover for the creation, location, and first Congressional support of the Medical Center. Due to his efforts, the facility was nicknamed &quot;Borden&#x27;s Dream.&quot;

In 1923, General John J. Pershing signed the War Department order creating the &quot;Army Medical Center&quot; (AMC) within the same campus as the WRGH. (At this time, the Army Medical School was relocated from 604 Louisiana Avenue and became the &quot;Medical Department Professional Service School&quot; (MDPSS) in the new Building 40.) Pershing lived at Walter Reed from 1944 until his death there 15 July 1948.

In September 1951, &quot;General Order Number 8&quot; combined the WRGH with the AMC, and the entire complex of 100 rose-brick Georgian Revival style buildings was at that time renamed the &quot;Walter Reed Army Medical Center&quot; (WRAMC). In June 1955, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) occupied the new Building 54 and, in November, what had been MDPSS was renamed the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). 1964 saw the birth of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing (WRAIN). Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower died at WRAMC on 28 March 1969.

Starting in 1972, a huge new WRAMC building (Building 2) was constructed and made ready for occupation by 1977. WRAIR moved from Building 40 to a large new facility on the WRAMC Forest Glen Annex in Maryland in 1999. Subsequently, Building 40 was slated for renovation under an enhanced use lease by a private developer.

In 2007, the University of Pennsylvania and WRAMC established a partnership whereby proton therapy technology would be available to treat United States military personnel and veterans in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine&#x27;s new Roberts Proton Therapy Center.

===2007 neglect scandal===

In February 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a series of investigative articles outlining cases of alleged neglect (physical deterioration of housing quarters outside hospital grounds, bureaucratic nightmares, etc.) at WRAMC as reported by outpatient soldiers and their families. A scandal and media furor quickly developed resulting in the firing of the WRAMC commanding general Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman, the resignation of Secretary of the Army Francis J. Harvey (reportedly at the request of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates), the forced resignation of Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, hospital commander from 2002 to 2004. Congressional committee hearings were called and numerous politicians weighed in on the matter including President George W. Bush, who had appointed Harvey, and Vice-president Dick Cheney. Several independent governmental investigations are ongoing and the controversy has spread to other military health facilities and the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system.

===2005 BRAC recommendation and 2011 closure===

As part of a Base Realignment and Closure announcement on 13 May 2005, the Department of Defense proposed replacing Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC); the new center would be on the grounds of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, seven miles (11 km) from WRAMC&#x27;s location in Washington, D.C. The proposal was part of a program to transform medical facilities into joint facilities, with staff including Army, Navy, and Air Force medical personnel.

On 25 August 2005, the BRAC Committee recommended passage of the plans for the WRNMMC. The transfer of services from the existing to the new facilities was gradual to allow for continuity of care for the thousands of service members, retirees and family members that depended upon WRAMC. The end of operations at the WRAMC facility occurred on 27 August 2011. The Army says the cost of closing that hospital and consolidating it with Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban Maryland more than doubled to $2.6 billion since the plan was announced in 2005 by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission.

<text>Spirit of Peoria is a riverboat that ran in the Peoria, Illinois area from 1988 to 2022. The boat participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion. &quot;Spirit of Peoria&quot; is a true paddleboat, actually using its paddlewheel for propulsion, unlike some modern riverboats with purely cosmetic wheels.

== Design ==
The boat was designed by architect Alan Bates, and built in 1988 at the Walker Boat Yard in Paducah, Kentucky, making it the first paddleboat vessel built there. The propulsion system was designed by Norm Rittenhouse, with steering by Custom Hydraulics.

&quot;Spirit of Peoria&quot; has no propellers or thrusters, and is powered by twin Caterpillar 3412 diesel gensets, producing 700 kilowatts combined in 208 volt 3-phase voltage. The AC power is rectified to DC which in turn powers two locomotive traction motors, which drive the paddlewheel via two by chains. This allows the boat to be comparatively fast and efficient, burning approximately of diesel fuel an hour, with a top speed of over . The dry weight is about 275 tons, with a passenger capacity of 385. The boat carries of fuel and of water.

== History ==

=== Peoria ===
Spirit of Peoria&#x27;s first voyage in 1988 was captained by Bob Anton.

In 1990, after riverboat gambling was legalized in Illinois and the owners of the Par-A-Dice received a license, the group leased the Spirit to operate on the Peoria side of the river until the East Peoria boat and facility was ready.

After the Par-A-Dice vacated the boat, the Peoria Park District operated the boat for a short time. Due to losing money, the boat was put up for sale and seemed headed for a new destination in Louisville, Kentucky. Lowell &quot;Bud&quot; Grieves purchased the boat with a 25-year lease to keep it in the Peoria area. When Grieves was elected mayor in 1997, he sold his interest in the boat to his son, Alex Grieves.

The regular area of travel of the boat on the Illinois River watershed ranged from Pere Marquette State Park near Grafton, Illinois to Starved Rock State Park near Ottawa, Illinois. The boat was owned and captained by G. Alex Grieves, and co-captained by Alice Grady and Dylan Masonholder.

=== Move from Peoria ===
As of April 2022, the &quot;Sprit of Peoria&quot; has been sold for $1 million and is no longer docked in Peoria, Illinois. Grieves offered the option to the city of Peoria to purchase the vessel, but the city council waived its right in a 8–3 vote.

The sternwheeler has sailed up the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where she joined the Julia Belle Swain. Both boats will undergo repairs and renovations and will ultimately operated together at a location that is yet unknown. Both boats are owned by Troy Manthey, President and CEO of Yacht Starship Cruises. Manthey is a 5th generation Streckfus family member, of the Streckfus Steamers.

<text>Christmas lights (also known as fairy lights, festive lights or [[string lights]]) are lights often used for decoration in celebration of Christmas, often on display throughout the Christmas season including Advent and Christmastide. The custom goes back to when Christmas trees were decorated with candles, which symbolized Christ being the light of the world. The Christmas trees were brought by Christians into their homes in early modern Germany.

Christmas trees displayed publicly and illuminated with electric lights became popular in the early 20th century. By the mid-20th century, it became customary to display strings of electric lights along streets and on buildings; Christmas decorations detached from the Christmas tree itself. In the United States, Canada and Europe, it became popular to outline private homes with such Christmas lights in tract housing starting in the 1960s. By the late 20th century, the custom had also been adopted in other nations, including outside the Western world, notably in Japan and Hong Kong. It has since spread throughout Christendom.

In many countries, Christmas lights, as well as other Christmas decorations, are traditionally erected on or around the first day of Advent. In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas lights are removed are Twelfth Night and Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations. Taking down Christmas decorations before Twelfth Night, as well as leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas is historically considered to be inauspicious.

==History==


The Christmas tree was first recorded to be used by the Lutheran Christians in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In homes, &quot;German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.&quot; These candles symbolized Jesus as the Light of the World. The Christmas tree was adopted in upper-class homes in 18th-century Germany, where it was occasionally decorated with candles, which at the time was a comparatively expensive light source. Candles for the tree were glued with melted wax to a tree branch or attached by pins. Around 1890, candleholders were first used for Christmas candles. Between 1902 and 1914, small lanterns and glass balls to hold the candles started to be used. Early electric Christmas lights were introduced with electrification, beginning in the 1880s.

The illuminated Christmas tree became established in the UK during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, and through emigration spread to North America and Australia. In her journal for Christmas Eve 1832, the 13-year-old princess wrote, &quot;After dinner.. we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room. There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees&quot;. Until the availability of inexpensive electrical power in the early 20th century, miniature candles were commonly (and in some cultures still are) used.

===United States===
The first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree was the creation of Edward H. Johnson, an associate of inventor Thomas Edison. While he was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, he had Christmas tree light bulbs especially made for him. He proudly displayed his Christmas tree, which was hand-wired with 80 red, white and blue electric incandescent light bulbs the size of walnuts, in December 1882 at his home near Fifth Avenue in New York City. Local newspapers ignored the story, seeing it as a publicity stunt. However, it was published by a Detroit newspaper reporter, and Johnson has become widely regarded as the Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights. By 1900, businesses started stringing up Christmas lights behind their windows. Christmas lights were too expensive for the average person; as such, electric Christmas lights did not become the majority replacement for candles until 1930.

In 1895, US President Grover Cleveland sponsored the first electrically lit Christmas tree in the White House. It featured over a hundred multicolored lights. The first commercially produced Christmas tree lamps were manufactured in strings of multiples of eight sockets by the General Electric Co. of Harrison, New Jersey. Each socket accepted a miniature two-candela carbon-filament lamp.

The first recorded uses of Christmas lights on outdoor trees occurred in San Diego in 1904; Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1909; and New York City in 1912. McAdenville, North Carolina, claims to have been the first in 1956.
The Library of Congress credits the town for inventing &quot;the tradition of decorating evergreen trees with Christmas lights dates back to 1956 when the McAdenville Men&#x27;s Club conceived of the idea of decorating a few trees around the McAdenville Community Center.&quot; However, the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree has had &quot;lights&quot; since 1931, but did not have real electric lights until 1956. Furthermore, Philadelphia&#x27;s Christmas Light Show and Disney&#x27;s Christmas Tree also began in 1956. In Canada, archival photos taken in 1956 around suburban Toronto capture several instances of outdoor evergreens illuminated with Christmas lights. Though General Electric sponsored community lighting competitions during the 1920s, it would take until the mid-1950s for the use of such lights to be adopted by average households.

Christmas lights found use in places other than Christmas trees. By 1919, city electrician John Malpiede began decorating the new Civic Center Park in Denver, Colorado, eventually expanding the display to the park&#x27;s Greek Amphitheater and later to the adjacent new Denver City and County Building - City Hall upon its completion in 1932.

 Soon, strings of lights adorned mantles and doorways inside homes, and ran along the rafters, roof lines, and porch railings of homes and businesses. In recent times, many city skyscrapers are decorated with long mostly-vertical strings of a common theme, and are activated simultaneously in Grand Illumination ceremonies.

In 1963, a boycott of Christmas lights was done in Greenville, North Carolina, to protest the segregation that kept blacks from being employed by downtown businesses in Greenville, during the Christmas sales season. Known as the Black Christmas boycott or &quot;Christmas Sacrifice&quot;, it was an effective way to protest the cultural and fiscal segregation in the town with 33% black population. Light decorations in the homes, on the Christmas trees, or outside the house were not shown, and only six houses in the black community broke the boycott that Christmas.

In 1973, during an oil shortage triggered by an embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (later OPEC), President Nixon asked Americans not to put up Christmas lights to conserve energy use. Many Americans complied, and there were fewer displays that year.

In the mid-2000s, the video of the home of Carson Williams was widely distributed on the internet as a viral video. It garnered national attention in 2005 from The Today Show on NBC, Inside Edition and the CBS Evening News and was featured in a Miller television commercial. Williams turned his hobby into a commercial venture, and was commissioned to scale up his vision to a scale of 250,000 lights at a Denver shopping center, as well as displays in parks and zoos.

==Technology==


The technology used in Christmas lighting displays is highly diverse, ranging from simple light strands, &quot;Christmas lights&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fairy lights&quot;), through to full blown animated tableaux, involving complex illuminated animatronics and statues.

Christmas lights (also called twinkle lights, holiday lights, mini lights or fairy lights), that are strands of electric lights used to decorate homes, public/commercial buildings and Christmas trees during the Christmas season are amongst the most recognized forms of Christmas lighting. Christmas lights come in a dazzling array of configurations and colors. The small &quot;midget&quot; bulbs commonly known as fairy lights are also called Italian lights in some parts of the U.S., such as Chicago. The first miniature Christmas lights were manufactured in Italy.

The types of lamps used in Christmas lighting also vary considerably, reflecting the diversity of modern lighting technology in general. Common lamp types are incandescent light bulbs and now light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are being increasingly encouraged as being more energy efficient. Less common are neon lamp sets. Fluorescent lamp sets were produced for a limited time by Sylvania in the mid-1940s.

Christmas lights using incandescent bulbs are somewhat notorious for being difficult to troubleshoot and repair. In the 1950s and 1960s, the series circuit connected light sets would go completely dark when a single bulb failed. So in the fairly recent past, the mini-lights have come with shunts to allow a set to continue to operate with a burned out bulb. However, if there are multiple bulb failures or a shunt is bad, the string can still fail. There are two basic ways to troubleshoot this: a one by one replacement with a known good bulb, or by using a test light to find out where the voltage gets interrupted. One example made specifically for Christmas lights is the LightKeeper Pro.

When Christmas light manufacturers first started using LEDs the colors seemed very dull and uninspiring. Even the white lights, which were typically single-chip LEDs, glowed with a faintly yellowish color that made them look cheap and unattractive according to the general public at the time.

==Outdoor displays==

===Public venues===

Displays of Christmas lights in public venues and on public buildings are a popular part of the annual celebration of Christmas, and may be set up by businesses or by local governments. The displays utilize Christmas lights in many ways, including decking towering Christmas trees in public squares, street trees and park trees, adorning lampposts and other such structures, decorating significant buildings such as town halls and department stores, and lighting up popular tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Sydney Opera House. It is believed that the first outdoor public electric light Christmas Holiday display was organized by Fredrick Nash and the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce in Altadena, California, on Santa Rosa Avenue, called Christmas Tree Lane. Christmas Tree Lane in Altadena has been continuously lit except during WW2 since 1920. Annual displays in Regent Street and Oxford Street, London, date from 1954 and 1959 respectively.

===Neighbourhoods===

Outdoor lighting outfits for the home were offered in quantity starting in the 1930s. By the 1960s, with the popularity of tract housing in the US, it became increasingly common to outline the house (particularly the eaves) with weatherproof Christmas lights. The Holiday Trail of Lights is a joint effort by cities in east Texas and northwest Louisiana that had its origins in the Festival of Lights and Christmas Festival in Natchitoches, started in 1927, making it one of the oldest light festivals in the US. Fulton Street in Palo Alto, California, has the nickname &quot;Christmas Tree Lane&quot; due to the display of lighted Christmas trees along the street.
A familiar pastime during the holiday season is to drive or walk around neighborhoods in the evening to see the lights displayed on homes. While some homes have no lights, others may have ornate displays requiring weeks to construct. Some displays are created for charities or local councils, for instance an annual display in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, is hosted around the Christmas period to raise money for their Lincolnshire and Nottingham air ambulances. They successfully raised £1,389.09 during their 2022 attempt. A few have made it to the &quot;Extreme Christmas&quot; TV specials shown on HGTV, at least one requiring a generator and another requiring separate electrical service to supply the electrical power required.
In Australia and New Zealand, chains of Christmas lights were quickly adopted as an effective way to provide ambient lighting to verandas, where cold beer is often served in the hot summer evenings. Since the late 20th century, increasingly elaborate Christmas lights have been displayed, and driving around between 8 and 10 p.m. to view the lights has become a popular form of family entertainment. In some areas Christmas lighting becomes a fierce competition, with town councils offering awards for the best decorated house, in other areas it is seen as a co-operative effort, with residents priding themselves on their street or their neighbourhood. Today it is estimated that more than 150 million light sets are sold in America each year, with more than 80 million homes decorated with holiday lights. The town of McAdenville, North Carolina, United States have a tradition called Christmas Town USA where the entire town is decorated with Christmas lights. The town of Lobethal, South Australia, in the Adelaide Hills, is famed for its Christmas lighting displays. Many residents expend great effort to have the best light display in the town. Residents from the nearby city of Adelaide often drive to the town to view them. In the US, the television series &quot;The Great Christmas Light Fight&quot; features homes across the country in a competition of homes with elaborate Christmas light displays.

==Other holidays==
In the United States, lights have been produced for many other holidays. These may be simple sets in typical holiday colors, or the type with plastic ornaments which the light socket fits into. Light sculptures are also produced in typical holiday icons.

Halloween is the most popular, with miniature light strings having black-insulated wires and semi-opaque orange bulbs. Later sets had some transparent purple bulbs (a representation of black, similar to blacklight), a few even have transparent green, or a translucent or semi-opaque lime green (possibly representing as in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, or creatures like goblins or space aliens). Two types of icicle lights are sold at Halloween: all-orange, and a combination of purple and green known as &quot;slime lights&quot;.

Easter lights are often produced in pastels. These typically have white wire and connectors.


Red, white, and blue lights are produced for Independence Day, as well as U.S. flag and other patriotic-themed ornaments. Net lights have been produced with the lights in a U.S. flag pattern. In 2006, some stores carried stakes with LEDs that light fiber-optics, looking similar to fireworks.

These above light strings are occasionally used on Christmas trees anyway, usually to add extra variety to the colors of the lights on the tree.

Various types of patio lighting with no holiday theme are also made for summertime. These are often clear white lights, but most are ornament sets, such as lanterns made of metal or bamboo, or plastic ornaments in the shape of barbecue condiments, flamingos and palm trees, or even various beers. Some are made of decorative wire or mesh, in abstract shapes such as dragonflies, often with glass &quot;gems&quot; or marbles. Light sculptures are also made in everything from wire-mesh frogs to artificial palm trees outlined in rope lights.

In Pakistan, fairy lights are often used to decorate in celebration of Eid ul-Fitr at Chaand Raat, which occurs at the end of Ramadan. In India on Diwali too, homes, shops and streets are decorated with strings of fairy lights.

==Environment, recycling, and safety==

Christmas lighting leads to some recycling issues. Annually more than 20 million pounds of discarded holiday lights are shipped to Shijiao, China (near Guangzhou), which has been referred to as &quot;the world capital for recycling Christmas lights&quot;. The region began importing discarded lights in part because of its cheap labor and low environmental standards. As late as 2009, many factories burned the lights to melt the plastic and retrieve the copper wire, releasing toxic fumes into the environment. A safer technique was developed that involved chopping the lights into a fine sand-like consistency, mixing it with water and vibrating the slurry on a table causing the different elements to separate out, similar to the process of panning for gold. Everything is recycled: copper, brass, plastic and glass.

More cities in the US are establishing schemes to recycle Christmas lights, with towns organizing drop-off points for handing in old lights.

As of December 2019, most scrap metal recycling centers will purchase traditional incandescent Christmas lights for between US$0.10/Lb - USD$0.20/Lb (€0.20/Kg - €0.40/kg). This scrap value is primarily derived from the recycling value of the copper found inside the wire, and to a lesser degree, other metals and alloys. As an example, a standard strand of modern incandescent Christmas lights weighing about 0.72 Lbs (0.33 kilo) was found to have less than 20% recoverable copper by weight.

Installing holiday lighting may be a safety hazard when incorrectly connecting several strands of lights, repeatedly using the same extension cords for the lights to plug into or using an unsafe ladder during the installation process.

==Light sculptures==

Christmas light sculptures, also called motifs, are used as Christmas decorations and for other holidays. Originally, these were large wireframe metalwork pieces made for public displays, such as for a municipal government to place on utility poles, and shopping centers to place on lampposts. Since the 1990s, these are also made in small plastic home versions that can be hung in a window, or on a door or wall. Framed motifs can be lit using mini lights or rope light, and larger scale motifs and sculptures may use C7 bulbs.

Light sculptures can be either flat (most common) or three-dimensional. Flat sculptures are the motifs, and are often on metal frames, but garland can also be attached to outdoor motifs. Indoor motifs often have a multicolored plastic backing sheet, sometimes holographic. 3D sculptures include deer or reindeer (even moose) in various positions, and with or without antlers, often with a motor to move the head up and down or side to side as if grazing. These and other 3D displays may be bare-frame, or be covered with garland, looped and woven transparent plastic cord or acrylic, or natural or goldtone-painted vines. Snowflakes are a popular design for municipal displays, so as not to be misconstrued as a government endorsement of religion, or so they can be left up all winter.

Some places make huge displays of these during December, such as Callaway Gardens, Life University, and Lake Lanier Islands in the U.S. state of Georgia. In east Tennessee, the cities of Chattanooga, Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg have light sculptures up all winter. Gatlinburg also has custom ones for Valentine&#x27;s Day and St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, while Pigeon Forge puts flowers on its tall lampposts for spring, and for winter has a steamboat and the famous picture of U.S. Marines &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;, in addition to the city&#x27;s historic Old Mill.

Some sculptures have microcontrollers that sequence circuits of lights, so that the object appears to be in motion. This is used for things such as snowflakes falling, Santa Claus waving, a peace dove flapping its wings, or train wheels rolling.

<doc id="791487" wikidata="Q3314567" url="?curid=791487" title="Milwaukee Road 261">
<text>Milwaukee Road 261 is a S3 class 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; type steam locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in Schenectady, New York, in July 1944 for the Milwaukee Road (MILW). It was used for heavy mainline freight and passenger work until being retired by the MILW in 1956.

Instead of being dismantled for scrap, 261 was preserved and donated to the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1958. Today, the locomotive is owned, operated and maintained by the Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization Friends of the 261, which runs occasional and seasonal excursion trains using the locomotive. The steam engine, restored in 1993, has logged more than under its own power since that time.

==History==
===Revenue service and retirement (1944–1956)===
Built by the American Locomotive Company in July 1944, 261 was originally operated by Milwaukee Road. The locomotive, weighing , is rated at a maximum of and maximum speed of and is coal-fueled. It operated on the railroad pulling mostly freight trains on the eastern portions of the route, but was also skilled at pulling fast passenger trains as well, and was assigned to the Milwaukee Division by March 1954. It was then retired in August 1956 and was eventually donated to the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin. As the new museum&#x27;s first acquisition, 261 was moved to the museum site in 1958.

===Excursion service===
In 1991, the newly formed &quot;North Star Rail&quot; selected 261 for restoration for mainline excursions. It was selected for a variety of reasons. The engine was large enough to handle the expected trains at track speed. It featured several modern features for a steam locomotive, including easier to maintain roller bearings. It also already had its asbestos lagging removed, which is very expensive to remove for environmental and safety reasons. Finally, 261&#x27;s relatively short 10-year service life meant that the engine&#x27;s boiler is more pristine, meaning it would take less work to rebuild the engine.

North Star Rail and the National Railroad Museum came to an agreement in November 1991 for a ten-year lease, which was renewed ten years later. 261 was moved from Green Bay to Minneapolis to the GE shops at Humboldt Yard in September 1992. There, a full-time staff rebuilt the engine. Work progressed quickly, allowing for a hydrostatic test in June 1993, a test fireup in July, and eventual restoration completion in September. After passing the FRA inspection on September 14, 1993, the engine deadheaded over Wisconsin Central in time for its first public excursions on September 18–19, 1993. The engine later returned to its new home at the leased Burlington Northern Minneapolis Junction facility.

The following year, 261 had an extensive season, including excursions on Wisconsin Central and the Twin Cities &amp; Western Railroad. Notable events included &quot;Chocolate City Days&quot; excursions, campaign trains, a movie shoot painted as &quot;Lackawanna 1661&quot;, running over CSX tracks for the famed &quot;New River Train&quot;, and a wrap-up celebrating the engine&#x27;s 50th birthday in 1994.

The engine participated in the Steamtown National Historic Site&#x27;s grand opening in July 1995. Over five days, 261 deadheaded from Minneapolis to Scranton, Pennsylvania. The locomotive stayed in Scranton for the next year pulling numerous excursions, including rare-mileage trips, a rare snowplow run, and the engine&#x27;s first steam doubleheader with New York, Susquehanna and Western 142. Originally, it was supposed to doublehead with Pere Marquette 1225 from Michigan, through Canada and into New York State before continuing south. While No. 261 was in Chicago, the doublehead was cancelled due to routing issues. No. 261 found an alternative by taking CSX into Pennsylvania and heading to New York via the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad. A Hancock 3-chime whistle was temporarily added to the locomotive and then replaced with an AT&amp;SF 6-chime whistle, which remains on it today, but still also keeping its original non-Hancock 3 chime whistle and Leslie A-125 air horn. 261 returned to the Midwest after almost a year at Steamtown. On its way home, the engine made its first runs over the newly formed BNSF Railway. It pulled a few sets of excursions in 1997 and 1998 over BNSF and TC&amp;W trackage.

The year of 1998 presented 261 with its biggest assignment yet, as it was the first steam engine to pull BNSF&#x27;s Employee Appreciation Special. The engine led a BNSF locomotive and a dozen of BNSF&#x27;s business-car fleet around the upper Midwest portion of BNSF&#x27;s route. This brought the engine back to Chicago before heading north to North Dakota and Montana, then through Minneapolis into Iowa before the EAS concluded at Topeka Railroad Days. 261 ended the 1998 operating season after a few more days on BNSF tracks.

The 1999 season was short, with a weekend excursion in May from Minneapolis to Duluth along with runs on the Lake Superior Railroad Museum&#x27;s tracks and another excursion in September. The year 2000 saw 261 leading excursions out of places such as Chicago, Omaha, and Kansas City. The engine also led an AAPRCO private-car special on August 29 to Duluth. The engine then led a long circle-trip over the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway as well as the North Shore Railroad System before heading back home. The 2001 season had excursions out of Minneapolis and Montevideo over BNSF and TC&amp;W tracks during June and July, with a complete set of &quot;Hiawatha&quot; passenger cars. The next year, 261 pulled an almost-matching consist between Minneapolis and Chicago. At this point, insurance rates were skyrocketing due to outside events, as well as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) guidelines. The Friends of the 261 had an insurance policy to run through 2002, making these trips among the last time that the group could afford to have 261 run solo.

In the following months, some major changes were made to the Friends of the 261&#x27;s operations. With insurance being too high to charge reasonable ticket prices, the group decided to team up with Amtrak. Amtrak is self-insured, so the added cost of excursion insurance was much less. However, Amtrak requires that all equipment meet Amtrak certification. The engine became the second steam engine to become Amtrak-certified, and the Friends of the 261 began to buy or rebuild coaches that would meet Amtrak specifications. The first team-up with Amtrak occurred in October 2003, with the engine&#x27;s return to old Milwaukee Road tracks between Minneapolis and Winona, Minnesota. These trips were repeated each year until 2011.

====2004–2008====

In June 2004, the engine made its first return visit to Milwaukee since being restored, overnighting on its way to Chicago to participate in the Grand Excursion: an approximate reenactment of the original Grand Excursion of 1854. It departed from Chicago, arriving in Rock Island, Illinois, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first railroad to reach the Mississippi River. During the Grand Excursion, 261 made day trips to Savanna, Illinois, over the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad, and to Bureau Junction, Illinois, on the Iowa Interstate Railroad, current owner/operator of the first railroad line to the Mississippi River. The train then traveled north along IC&amp;E rails near the river, making overnight stops at Dubuque, Iowa, and La Crosse, Wisconsin. The final leg up to the Twin Cities operated in Wisconsin on BNSF trackage.

261 ran excursions from Minneapolis to Duluth via BNSF trackage in both 2005 and 2007.

Three June 2006 excursions were launched from Milwaukee: a dinner train in Friday, June 23 to Sturtevant, Wisconsin, and Saturday and Sunday excursions (24th and 25th) to Wisconsin Dells. For these runs, the train was turned at New Lisbon. These excursions would be repeated in August 2008.
In September 2006, 261 and its train visited Rock Island, Illinois, as part of RiverWay 2006, a Quad Cities celebration of the 150th anniversary of the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856. As part of the festivities, 261&#x27;s train was coupled to a pair of Chinese-built QJ 2-10-2 steam locomotives 6988 and 7081 for a trip to Homestead, Iowa, on September 15, 2006. The next day, 261 was added to run a &quot;triple-header&quot; from Rock Island to Bureau Junction, Illinois; then, on the following day, the QJs pulled the train, without 261, to Muscatine, Iowa, and back. Diesels were not used on any of these excursions.

In September 2007, Canadian Pacific 2816 and 261 reunited for another doubleheader to Winona. No diesels or water cars were used on the trip. The Friends of the 261 had helped the Canadian Pacific Railway plan 2816&#x27;s return to the United States, as well as providing half of the consist 2816 led.

In May 2008, 261 was featured on a photo charter on the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. Following this, the engine was moved to Chicago for filming in &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, a movie based on the life of John Dillinger and starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Though 261 was built ten years after Dillinger died, the engine did fit the bill for a steam engine that could be filmed at Chicago Union Station. The engine&#x27;s final excursion before the required FRA &quot;15 year inspection&quot; for 261 was a run in September 2008 on Canadian Pacific&#x27;s ex-Milwaukee Road line from Minneapolis to Winona, with a return on BNSF&#x27;s ex-Burlington Northern line from La Crosse to Minneapolis. Following the engine being pulled from service, The Friends of the 261 quickly began a rebuild of the engine.

===Acquisition from the National Railroad Museum (2009–2010)===
In 2009, the work on 261 was halted to concentrate efforts on Southern Pacific 4449. The famed &quot;Daylight&quot; was to participate in TrainFestival 2009, and the Friends of the 261 played a major part in the engine being able to participate. The group provided several passenger cars for 4449&#x27;s excursion from Portland, Oregon, to Owosso, Michigan, that started on July 3, 2009, as well as TrainFestival 2009. After being away for three months, the 4449 arrived in Portland on October 20, 2009. 

In November 2009, the Friends of the 261 and the National Railroad Museum had problems with negotiations over lease agreements. The museum was asking too much for the Friends to pay, especially while in the middle of a large overhaul. The Friends of the 261 decided to end the lease with the National Railroad Museum, citing the high costs, and began looking for another locomotive to restore.

In mid-January 2010, the engine was found on the website of Sterling Rail, a rail equipment broker, stating that there was a sale pending. The engine was supposedly to be sold to a California-based collector, who would have potentially let the Friends overhaul and operate 261; however, the transaction was never completed. At the time, Steve Sandberg, CEO of the organization, said he was engaged in talks with other organizations about leasing a different engine. In an email dated November 17, 2009, he informed the National Railroad Museum that his organization had decided to discontinue operating 261, according to Michael E. Telzrow, executive director of the National Railroad Museum. Per the terms of their agreement, the Friends of the 261 would be responsible for returning the locomotive to the Museum. However, the Friends of the 261 finally were able to purchase the locomotive in May 2010 for $225,000, keeping it in Minneapolis and returning it to operation upon its rebuild.

===Second excursion career (2013–present)===
On September 29, 2012, 261 was test-fired and ran under its own power once again for the first time since 2008.

In April 2013, it successfully operated a test train on the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. It ran normally from Minneapolis and then operated tender-first back to Minneapolis.

On May 11, 2013 (National Train Day), 261 ran on an excursion north from Minneapolis to Duluth, where it met Soo Line 4-6-2 No. 2719 for the first time, along with Duluth and Northern Minnesota 2-8-2 No. 14. 261 stayed in Duluth overnight and had a photo shoot with 2719. On May 12, 261 returned to Minneapolis. Amtrak P42DC #17 joined 261 for this trip.

On October 12, 2013, 261 made a round-trip fall-color excursion to Willmar, Minnesota. On October 13, 2013, 261 made a second round-trip excursion to Boylston, Wisconsin. Amtrak P40DC #824 joined 261 for these trips.

On September 27, 2014, 261 ran on a round-trip Fall Colors Excursion to Duluth, returning to Minneapolis on September 28. The excursion traveled on BNSF&#x27;s Hinckley Subdivision. Amtrak P42DC #174 joined 261 for this trip.

In 2014, 261 operated the Inaugural &quot;North Pole Express&quot; in St. Paul. For two weekends, 261 operated out of St. Paul Union Depot pulling short trips decorated for this excursion. The train consisted of 4 coaches and operated on a long track on the Depot grounds. 261 even posed next to Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Holiday Train when it also visited the depot. It reprised its role as the locomotive for the &quot;North Pole Express&quot; at St. Paul Union Depot from 2015 to 2022, operating over two weekends each December. During the 2022 run, the locomotive only operated the first weekend; the 32A operated trains the second.

In October 2015, 261 attended the 2015 Railway Interchange Show in Minneapolis on October 4–7. On October 10, 261 pulled a daytime round-trip excursion to Boylston, WI, where it was wyed and returned to Minneapolis. The next day, 261 did the same to Willmar, MN, but used a turntable to face forward for the return to Minneapolis. Amtrak&#x27;s Phase IV heritage unit #184 joined 261 for both trips.

261 traveled to St. Paul Union Depot under steam to be displayed along other equipment for &quot;Union Depot Train Days&quot;, celebrating the 90th anniversary of the building. It was featured in a night photo shoot with Soo Line 2500, an EMD FP7.

On June 4, 2016, 261 ran a round-trip to Duluth, Minnesota, returning to Minneapolis on June 5. Amtrak had been power short, so 261 performed this trip on its own. In September 2016, 261 operated on Twin Cities and Western Railroad and Minnesota Prairie Line trackage. The Minnesota Prairie Line is former Chicago and North Western Railway trackage that originally belonged to the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. 261 operated as far west as Winthrop, Minnesota. It was the first time in 60 years that a steam engine had operated on the Minnesota Prairie Line. The same route was operated in the fall of 2017.

In October 2016, 261 operated three round-trips from Minneapolis on the Twin Cities and Western Railroad, running on former Milwaukee Road tracks. 261 operated without a diesel helper except to be pulled back to Minneapolis, as there were no places to turn the train around.

In June 2017, 261 operated on the Red River Valley and Western Railroad in North Dakota.

Due to changes made to Amtrak&#x27;s policy for charter trains in 2018, 261 was unable to perform a majority of excursions, including an excursion to Duluth that was supposed to take place in June of that year.

On September 8 and 9, 2018, Friends of the 261 operated two excursions for Fall Color and Gourmet Express where they operated west from Minneapolis to Glencoe, Minnesota, on Twin Cities and Western trackage, with a stop near Norwood Young America, Minnesota, for the gourmet food and wine and a photo runby.

On September 22, 2018, for the 25th anniversary of the first excursion in 1993, 261 pulled a special train for the annual convention of the American Association of Private Railroad Car Owners (AAPRCO).

In May 2019, after an agreement made in January, Friends of the 261 acquired former Milwaukee Road EMD E9 #32A from the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, which is owned by Watco. First showcased at Union Depot Day from May 31 to June 2, it pulled its first excursion on June 22, still painted in Wisconsin and Southern colors minus the former lettering. The E9 locomotive has since been repainted into Milwaukee colors and debuted in its new paint scheme on May 12, 2021.

In June 2019, 261 pulled two excursions for the Milwaukee Road Historical Association convention being held in Minneapolis, called &quot;261 Hiawatha&quot;. On June 22, 2019, the train operated from Minneapolis to Brownton, Minnesota, on the Twin Cities and Western. On June 23, 2019, the train traveled between Minneapolis and Norwood/Young America on TC&amp;W, then from Norwood to Winthrop on TC&amp;W subsidiary Minnesota Prairie Line: a rare-mileage trip for 261.

On September 21 and 22, 2019, there were two excursions for the Gourmet Express.

On March 11, 2021, a $200,000 proposal was made to convert No. 261&#x27;s firebox from burning coal to oil. However, this is not the first time an S3 class was converted to oil, as Nos. 262, 263, 267 and 269 were converted to oil during their revenue careers.

<doc id="791513" wikidata="Q3304330" url="?curid=791513" title="1976 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1976 Atlantic hurricane season was a fairly average Atlantic hurricane season in which 21 tropical or subtropical cyclones formed. 10 of them became nameable storms. Six of those reached hurricane strength, with two of the six becoming major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the first system, a subtropical storm, developed in the Gulf of Mexico on May 21, several days before the official start of the season. The system spawned nine tornadoes in Florida, resulting in about $628,000 (1976 USD) in damage, though impact was minor otherwise.

The season featured only one fully tropical storm throughout the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, a rare occurrence. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Belle, which reached Category 3 intensity east of North Carolina. Belle later struck Long Island, New York, as a Category 1 hurricane, causing $100 million in damage and a total of 12 deaths between the Carolinas and New England, as well as an additional $1 million in damage in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Tropical Storm Dottie and a subtropical storm in mid-September produced minor damage in the Southeastern United States; the former also caused four deaths in the Bahamas after a fishing boat capsized. Although Hurricane Emmy left little damage in the Azores, poor weather conditions resulted in a plane crash at Lajes Field, killing 68 people. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in 84 deaths and about $101.63 million in damage.

== Seasonal summary ==
The hurricane season officially began on June 1, though the first tropical cyclone developed on May 21. A total of 21 tropical and subtropical cyclones formed, but just 10 of them intensified into nameable storm systems. This was about average compared to the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Six of these reached hurricane status, around the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, two systems reached major hurricane status; close to the 1950–2000 average of 2.3. Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 84 deaths and about $101.63 million in damage. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November 30, with the final cyclone becoming extratropical on October 28.

The season was noted for a lack of activity in both the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Just one fully tropical storm, Dottie, developed in the Gulf of Mexico and none in the Caribbean Sea. Since 1900, only 1962 had fewer tropical storms (none) in those regions. Suppression of activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean was primarily attributed to early intrusions of cold air – with unusually cold air masses impacting much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during October – and a persistent area of above average vertical wind shear over the western Caribbean. Elsewhere, sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic basin were generally at or slightly above average during the middle of the season.

Tropical cyclogenesis began early, with the development of a subtropical storm on May 21. Two tropical depression formed in June, though neither reached tropical storm status. Another two depressions formed in July and also did not become tropical storms, followed by the development of Tropical Storm Anna on July 28. August featured five of the season&#x27;s ten named storms, including Tropical Storm Dottie and hurricanes Belle, Candice, Emmy, and Frances. In September, six cyclones developed – a subtropical storm, Hurricane Gloria, and four tropical depressions that remained below tropical storm intensity. Two more non-intensifying depressions formed in October. Hurricane Holly, the final system, formed on October 22 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 28.

The year&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 84, classifying it as a &quot;near-normal&quot; season. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Subtropical Storm One ===
On May 19 an upper-level trough produced widespread thunderstorms over the Gulf of Mexico. Slowly, the system organized, first to a subtropical depression on May 21, then to a subtropical storm on May 23. The storm began to move faster, and on May 23, it hit the Florida Panhandle. After moving across Georgia at a forward motion of the storm reached its peak of maximum sustained winds reaching 50 mph (85 km/h) while southeast of the Carolinas on May 24. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, the system traveled generally northeast and ultimately dissipated on May 31 south of Iceland.

Heavy rainfall was associated with the system, but the precipitation was generally beneficial due to dry conditions. The storm spawned nine tornadoes in Florida, with one in Hillsborough County destroying 6 mobile homes and damaging 40 others; demolishing 6 large chicken houses; and severely damaging a paint plant in Hillsborough County. Overall, the tornadoes left about $628,000 in damage. A total of 3,364 household lost power in the Hillsborough County after three circuits were blown down. Some wind damage occurred in northeastern Palm Beach County, mostly limited to a few roofs damaged and downed trees, electrical poles, and power lines. The storm left about 15,000 people without electricity in Broward County, though most outages were restored quickly. Boat traffic along the New River was backed-up due to the storm causing the draw bridge to malfunction. Farther north, the storm dropped rainfall in a few other states, with a peak precipitation total of at Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina.
=== Tropical Storm Anna ===

A non-tropical low pressure area developed over the central Atlantic in late July. After merging with a polar trough on July 28, a subtropical depression developed about east-southeast of Bermuda at 18:00 UTC. The subtropical depression moved eastward and strengthened into a subtropical storm early on July 30, based on reports from the ship &quot;M.S. Pointe Allegre&quot;, which observed a barometric pressure of and wind gusts as high as . The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) at 12:00 UTC on July 30. Curving east-northeastward, the system also acquired tropical characteristics, with a transition to Tropical Storm Anna becoming complete about six hours later. The surface ridge to the north and east caused Anna to begin curving northeastward on August 1. Anna soon lost tropical characteristics and became an extratropical cyclone while situated about east-southeast of the Azores. The remnants moved in a circular path and approached the Azores from the north, before dissipating on August 16. Gale-force winds were reported in the Azores after Anna became extratropical.
=== Hurricane Belle ===
In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Belle on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall in Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane before moving inland over southern New England as a tropical storm hours later. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland.

Threatening much of the East Coast of the United States, hurricane warnings were issued from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000 people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Five people lost their lives in a car accident on a rain-slicked highway near the North Carolina–Virginia state line; another person died due to a car accident in Norfolk, Virginia. In New York, damage on Long Island reached $8 million, of which $3 million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed in New York when a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. Approximately 36,000 residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost electricity. In Connecticut, strong winds in Bridgeport downed trees, which fell on barns, porches, and homes. About 247,000 people lost electricity throughout the state. Three deaths occurred in Connecticut, one from an accident caused by slippery roads and the other two from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator. Flooding was reported across New England and was especially severe in Vermont. The hardest hit town was Chester, where 35 of its 85 roads flooded and 5 bridges were washed out. Two people died in Huntington after the footbridge they were crossing collapsed into the Huntington River. A total of 12 people lost their lives and damage reached an estimated $100 million. In Canada, heavy rains fell across New Brunswick, amounting to in Edmundston, triggering flooding that damaged crops, homes, and roads. Damage estimates reached at least $1 million.
=== Tropical Storm Dottie ===
An area of low pressure in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico developed into a tropical depression early on August 18. The depression drifted east and northeastward over the next day, before beginning to accelerate on August 19. The cyclone further intensified into Tropical Storm Dottie by 12:00 UTC. Shortly thereafter, Dottie made landfall in Florida over mainland Monroe County. The cyclone quickly proceeded northeastward before re-emerging into the Atlantic near Palm Beach. Dottie moved northward and peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 06:00 UTC on August 20, before subsequently weakening due to wind shear. By the time Dottie made landfall in Charleston, South Carolina, early on August 21, it was barely of tropical storm intensity. It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.

Dottie dropped heavy rainfall in South Florida, with a peak total of . However, impact from the precipitation was mainly limited to street flooding in several cities, which delayed the commute of thousands of motorists during morning rush hour traffic, especially in Miami. Tropical storm force wind gusts damaged a roof in Marathon, downed some trees, and disrupted electricity in at least 20 neighborhoods, though wind damage overall was minor. In the Bahamas, a fishing boat capsized near Grand Bahama, drowning four of its occupants. Rainfall was generally light in the Carolinas, though of precipitation fell in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, flooding some areas of the city with up to of water. However, rainfall was mostly beneficial due to a severe drought. Beach erosion occurred due to tides reaching normal at Atlantic Beach.
=== Hurricane Candice ===

On August 11, a cold-core low was located south of Bermuda. Over the next week, the system warmed and moved toward the surface. Around 12:00 UTC on August 18, the low developed into a tropical depression about west-southwest of the island, after satellite imagery showed better organization and a ship reporting winds gusting to . Moving fairly quickly to the north-northeast, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Candice about six hours later. Candice curved east-northeastward early on August 20 and weakened slightly, before re-strengthening later that day. By 06:00 UTC on August 20, the cyclone intensified into a hurricane. Becoming a hurricane at 41.2°N, Candice was one of few Atlantic tropical storms to intensify into a hurricane while situated north of 40°N. Around that time, Candice had decelerated and briefly turned to the southeast, before pivoting northeastward on August 21. Candice continued to intensify, peaking with sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum pressure of later on the following day. The hurricane then accelerated due to an approaching cold front, before merging with the front about 475 mi (765 km) east of Newfoundland at 12:00 UTC on August 24.
=== Hurricane Emmy ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 15. The wave moved westward at before developing into a tropical depression on August 20, while it was situated approximately east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Emmy on August 22 as it moved west-northwestward. Two days later, it recurved to the northeast due to a rapidly developing, unseasonable frontal low pressure system to the northeast. After intensifying into a Category 1 hurricane on August 25, the storm began moving eastward due to a frontal low pressure system located to the northeast. Late on August 26, Emmy strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while moving northeastward.

The hurricane resumed its west-northwestward course late on August 27, before again turning to the east early on August 29 due to strong upper-level westerlies. At 12:00 UTC, Emmy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The cyclone slowly weakened while moving eastward, falling to Category 1 intensity on September 1. Emmy briefly headed east-southeastward, before turning to the north-northeast on September 2. Between late on the following day and early on September 4, Emmy passed through the Azores, before being absorbed by Hurricane Frances shortly after moving north of the islands. Damage in the Azores was apparently not significant, though the storm caused 68 deaths when a Venezuelan Air Force plane carrying a school choir crashed on a landing attempt at Lajes Air Base.
=== Hurricane Frances ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 24. After moving westward for three days, the system developed into a tropical depression about west-southwest of the southwesternmost Cape Verde Islands. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on August 28 recorded winds of and a barometric pressure of , which resulted in the cyclone being upgraded to Tropical Storm Frances. The storm began curving northwestward due to a weakness in the Azores High caused by the recent passage of Hurricane Emmy. By early on August 30, Frances intensified into a hurricane. About 24 hours later, the cyclone turned northward well northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Strengthening further, Frances peaked as a Category 3 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 1, with reconnaissance measuring sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .

Frances almost immediately began weakening thereafter, falling to Category 2 intensity by midday on September 1. The weakness in the Azores High continued to influence the storm&#x27;s path, causing Frances to recurve to the east around that time. A slower weakening trend commenced, with the storm being downgraded to a Category 1 on September 3. After curving northeastward, Frances began losing tropical characteristics while approaching the Azores. The transition to an extratropical cyclone was fully completed at 12:00 UTC on September 4, with Frances centered about south-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores. The extratropical remnants passed through the Azores and completed a counterclockwise loop north of the islands before dissipating on September 7.
=== Subtropical Storm Three ===

On September 12, the interaction between mid-tropospheric low and a diffuse stationary front led to the formation of a low pressure system over central Florida. As it moved north-northeastward, a circulation formed, resulting in the development of a subtropical depression over Polk County, Florida, on September 13. The next day, it intensified into a subtropical storm and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) while just off the coast of Georgia. The storm quickly made landfall near Charleston, South Carolina, at the same intensity. After moving inland, the cyclone weakened to a subtropical depression late on September 15 near the North Carolina–South Carolina state line. The storm dissipated over southern Virginia on September 17.

Tides produced by the storm ranged from above normal along the coast of the Carolinas, leaving minor beach erosion. The storm produced wind gusts up to in Charleston, South Carolina. Rain fell in several states along the East Coast of the United States and was generally beneficial. However, in central and southern Maryland, where the storm dropped a peak total of of precipitation in Towson, downpours resulted in flooding. The Baltimore area received its highest amount of rainfall for any day in the month of September. Heavy precipitation delayed commutes, while water entered some homes, flooded roads, and resulted in a few school closures.
=== Hurricane Gloria ===

On September 18, a tropical wave entered the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. While the wave moved west-northwestward at about , an upper-tropospheric cold low pressure interacted with and later merged with the system, causing cloud features to become better organized by September 23. After three days, the low-level circulation became well-defined, resulting in the development of a tropical depression about northeast of the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved slowly northward and intensified into Tropical Storm Gloria at 12:00 UTC on September 27. Early the following day, Gloria began moving northwestward. By 06:00 UTC on September 29, the cyclone intensified into a hurricane and became a Category 2 hurricane about 24 hours later. Gloria peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at 12:00 UTC on September 30, based on reconnaissance observations and satellite imagery.

Beginning on September 30, the hurricane tracked northeastward and then east-northward due to a multiple short-wave troughs crossing Atlantic Canada and moving into the Atlantic. Gloria slowly leveled off in intensity, weakening to a Category 1 hurricane at 12:00 UTC on October 1. Early the next day, the storm fell to tropical storm status. After a jog to the east-southeast on October 3, Gloria resumed its east-northeasterly motion on October 4. Around that time, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression. Gloria also began losing tropical characteristics and became extratropical about west-southwest of the northwesternmost islands of the Azores at 00:00 UTC on October 5.
=== Hurricane Holly ===

A tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa on October 14. The wave initially remained relatively weak, until convection began concentrating near the center while it was situated well east of the Lesser Antilles on October 20. After further organization, a tropical depression developed at 18:00 UTC on October 22 roughly 405 mi (650 km) east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved north-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Holly about 24 hours later. Shortly thereafter, the storm curved north-northeastward and intensified at a faster pace. At 12:00 UTC on October 24, Holly became a Category 1 hurricane and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, the system weakened back to a tropical storm about 24 hours later due to interaction with an upper trough. Early on October 27, Holly began accelerating northeastward ahead of a cold front. The storm merged with the cold front late on October 28 about northwest of the Azores. The remnants quickly became indistinguishable.
=== Other systems ===

Throughout the 1976 season, there were 11 tropical depressions monitored that did not achieve gale intensity. The first such system developed just north of Grand Bahama in the Bahamas on June 7. Moving north-northeastward for much of its duration, the depression strengthened slightly to reach winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). However, it failed to become a tropical storm before weakening and dissipating about 155 mi (250 km) south of Nantucket island in Massachusetts on June 9. Two days after the previous depression dissipated, another tropical depression formed over Hendry County, Florida. Light rainfall was recorded in West Palm Beach, while several waterspouts were reported in Lake Okeechobee near Clewiston. The depression moved northeastward and quickly emerged into the Atlantic. About 30 hours after developing, the depression dissipated approximately northwest of Bermuda on June 12. Activity in the Atlantic then ceased for more than a month, until a tropical depression formed about 355 mi (570 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina on July 20. The depression moved north-northwestward, before turning northeastward on the following day. It dissipated about halfway between Cape Hatteras and Bermuda on July 22. The next depression formed about south of the Cape Verde Islands on July 23. Trekking just south of due west, the cyclone was short-lived and dissipated by the following day.

As hurricanes Emmy and Frances were becoming extratropical, another tropical depression formed offshore the Carolinas on September 4. The depression moved parallel to the coast and intensified slightly. However, it dissipated roughly halfway between Cape Hatteras and Bermuda on September 6. The next depression developed over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 5. After initially moving northwestward, the cyclone curved westward about 24 hours later. On September 7, the depression dissipated just south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Another depression formed near the Cape Verde Islands on September 20. Moving generally northwestward for several days, the depression strengthened slightly, but not enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm. By September 25, the depression recurved northeastward. Two days later, it dissipated over the central Atlantic. A depression then developed near the middle of the Gulf of Mexico on September 22. Tracking northward, the depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) late on September 24, before quickly dissipating over Mississippi. The next depression formed over the deep tropics on September 26. Failing to intensify significantly, the depression dissipated about two days later. The next system, classified as Tropical Depression Ten, formed about halfway between the coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles on October 3. After initially trekking west-northwestward for a few days, it turned southwestward on October 5. The depression crossed the Lesser Antilles early on October 8, passing between Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent. Continuing westward over the Caribbean, the storm slowly curved northward by October 9. Early on October 12, the depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Later that day, it dissipated off the north coast of Dominican Republic near Luperón. The depression brought heavy rainfall to parts of Puerto Rico, with a peak total of near Guayama. The last non-intensifying tropical depression developed about halfway between Puerto Rico and the west coast of Africa on October 12. The system initially moved northwestward, but curved northeastward after two days. It dissipated over the central Atlantic by October 15.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1976. Storms were named &quot;Belle&quot;, &quot;Candice&quot;, &quot;Dottie&quot;, &quot;Emmy&quot;, and &quot;Gloria&quot; for the first time in 1976. The names &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Frances&quot;, and &quot;Holly&quot; have previously been used on the old naming lists. No names were retired following the season; however, an overhaul of the naming system in 1979 to include male names resulted in this list being discarded.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1976 USD.

<text>The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season was a very inactive Atlantic hurricane season, with only six named storms. The season officially began on Wednesday, June 1, 1977 and lasted until Wednesday, November 30, 1977. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical cyclone of the season developed over the western Caribbean Sea on June 13, 12 days after the start of the season. Three more organized during July and early August. Then, on August 29, the first named storm, Hurricane Anita formed and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane on September 1, before weakening slightly and striking Mexico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing 11 fatalities and leaving at least 25,000 people homeless.

In addition to Anita, another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe. The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana, resulting in $13 million (1977 USD) in damage. After moving inland, it spawned 14 tornadoes throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In addition to Anita and Babe, five other tropical cyclones – hurricanes Clara, Dorothy, and Evelyn, as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine – left only minor impacts on land. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11 fatalities and more than $13 million in damage, excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine, which led to 53 deaths and $203 million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States, New Jersey, and New York.
== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1977. Activity began several days later with the formation of a tropical depression on June 13. Although 16 tropical depressions formed, it was a below average season because only six strengthened into tropical storms. In terms of named storms, this was the least active season since 1965. Five of these attained hurricane status, and one of the five eventually attained major hurricane status, which is Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The inactivity was attributed to an El Niño that began developing in August. Three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season, causing 11 deaths and $13 million in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Depression Nine, dissipated on November 7, over three weeks before the official end of the season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1977 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of a tropical depression on June 13. Activity briefly halted, until two other tropical depressions developed in the second half of July. A fourth tropical depression formed in early August. Later that month, Hurricane Anita developed on August 29. It was the latest in the season for a first named storm to form in the satellite era. September, the climatological peak of hurricane season, was its most active month. Five tropical cyclones developed, including two tropical depressions, and hurricanes Babe, Clara, and Dorothy. There were also five tropical cyclones in October – three tropical depressions, Hurricane Evelyn, and Tropical Storm Frieda. The final tropical cyclone of the season, Tropical Depression Nine, developed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3 and dissipated by November 7.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 25, which was the lowest ACE value since 1946. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Hurricane Anita ===
A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on August 29, while located about 230 miles (370 km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. The depression moved west-southwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita early on August 30. Later that day, the storm had intensified into a hurricane. Although intensification briefly slowed, rapid deepening occurred from September 1 to the following day, when Anita peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The storm weakened slightly to a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall near Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. It rapidly weakened inland, decreasing to tropical depression intensity early on September 3. However, Anita remained intact across Mexico and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean as a depression.

Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor to Anita dropped light rainfall in Florida. Gusty winds and storm surge effected Louisiana. At Grand Isle, storm tides above normal resulted in hundreds of families being asked to evacuate. Numerous coastal highways in Texas, including portions of State Highway 87, were closed due to above normal tides. Precipitation reached in Rio Grande City. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The roofs of most buildings were destroyed near the location of Anita&#x27;s landfall. The highest amount of precipitation observed during the storm was at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. Flooding and mudslides killed eleven people in the state. Overall damage is unknown.
=== Hurricane Babe ===
The interaction of a tropical wave and a cold upper low pressure area developed into a subtropical depression in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 3. It strengthened while gradually acquiring tropical characteristics and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Babe late on September 4. The storm curved north-northeastward and by early on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Around that time, Babe peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Early on September 5, Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana at the same intensity. Later that day, it weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on September 6. However, Babe continued to move northeastward and then east-northeastward across the Southeastern United States until dissipating early on September 9.

Babe produced light to moderate rainfall across much of the Southern United States. In Louisiana, precipitation peaked at near Lafayette. Flooding damage was primarily to crops, mainly sugar cane. Six tornadoes were spawned in Louisiana, including one near Hammond that severely damage a country store and knocked six wood-frame homes off their foundations. Damage from this tornado alone reached $2.5 million. In other states, Babe brought flash flooding along its path due to rainfall exceeding in Mississippi, northwestern Georgia, and western North Carolina. Overall, Babe caused about $13 million in damage, but no deaths.
=== Hurricane Clara ===

A convective cloud mass with a spiral band of gale-force winds, associated with the development of Hurricane Babe, moved across the Southeastern United States in early September. The system developed a circulation by late on September 4, while tracking across southeastern Georgia. After a slight drop in barometric pressure and an increase in wind speeds, a tropical depression formed inland near Charleston, South Carolina at 1200 UTC on September 5. The depression initially drifted east-northeastward and soon moved offshore. After passing south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September 6, it began to organize while accelerating just north of due east. At 0000 UTC on September 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Clara. The storm quickly strengthened, becoming a hurricane only 12 hours later. Strong wind shear caused Clara to weaken back to a tropical storm on September 9. Thereafter, the storm executed a cyclonic loop near Bermuda. By late on September 10, Clara accelerated northeastward and became extratropical at 1200 UTC on September 11.

In its early stages, the storm dropped light rainfall in the Southeastern United States, peaking at in Beaufort, South Carolina. Additionally, Clara produced of precipitation in Bermuda. The remnants reached Canada and produced winds of in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, which knocked over campers, uprooted trees, damaged barns, and caused power outages in the area.
=== Hurricane Dorothy ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 15. The system tracked westward at and convection began organizing five days later. On September 21, the wave crossed the Windward Islands, bringing wind gusts of to Guadeloupe and Martinique and rainfall of on several islands. Although it was a strong tropical wave, the system weakened significantly while crossing Hispaniola on September 23. Tracking steadily northward, it developed into a tropical depression northeast of the Bahamas on September 26. A reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy at 1200 UTC on September 27.

Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, Dorothy passed just south of Bermuda, though no damage was reported on the island. The storm quickly strengthened while tracking northeastward and strengthened into a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 28. By early on September 29, Dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Later that day, Dorothy transitioned into an extratropical storm while located south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. On September 30, the extratropical remnants of Dorothy were absorbed by a frontal low pressure system located in the northern Atlantic Ocean.
=== Hurricane Evelyn ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 3. The system tracked westward at an abnormally low altitude of 6°N. However, because the Azores high pressure was abnormally weak, the system quickly curved northwestward. After a significant increase in convection, a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on October 13, while located south of Bermuda. A ship later reported gale-force winds, prompting an upgrade of the depression to Tropical Storm Evelyn on October 14. Early on the following day, a reconnaissance flight recorded winds of , indicating that Evelyn became a hurricane. Later on October 15, accelerated to the north-northeast and made landfall on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) at 1200 UTC. Shortly after entering the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Evelyn merged with a cold front at 1800 UTC on October 15, near the tip of southeastern Newfoundland.

Impact on Bermuda was limited to light winds and a small amount of rainfall – . On Sable Island, Evelyn produced tropical storm force winds, reaching . In both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, the storm dropped light rainfall, rarely exceeding . Some areas of Newfoundland experienced tropical storm force winds, mainly between Stephenville and St. John&#x27;s. However, this may have been in combination with the cold front that Evelyn merged with. In addition, a ship near the southwestern tip of Newfoundland reported sustained winds of .
=== Tropical Storm Frieda ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 4. The wave tracked uneventfully westward for about 10 days. On October 12, the remnants of a cold front reached the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The wave began interacting with it and another cold front that entered the region by October 16. Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft reported a surface circulation near Swan Island, Honduras. Thus, a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on October 16. The depression moved slowly westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frieda on October 17, while passing south of Swan Island.

Frieda continued to intensify until peaking with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of early on October 18. Later that day, Frieda weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity. At 0000 UTC on October 19, the storm made landfall near Belize City, Belize as a weak tropical depression. Frieda promptly dissipated. Belize City reported only minimal rainfall and light winds. Around that time, the storm passed south of Swan Island, where it produced in a 30‑hour period. On Grand Cayman, of precipitation fell in 36 hours.
=== Tropical Depression Nine ===

A tropical depression formed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3. Initially, the depression moved northeastward, though on November 4, a building high pressure area forced it to track north of due west. Eventually, an upper-level low situated over the Southern United States caused the depression to re-curve north-northwestward. Late on November 7, the depression made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina. By early on the following day, the depression degenerated into a low pressure area while located over eastern Virginia. The remnants continued northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while offshore of Maine on November 11.

Moisture from Tropical Depression Nine and a low pressure area that tracked across the Southeastern United States resulted in heavy rainfall over western North Carolina and western Virginia, with up to at Idlewild in the former. In North Carolina, flooding destroyed 384 homes, of highways, and 12 dams. Flooding was considered the worst in Yancey County, where nearly every bridge was washed out. Sixteen counties in the western portions of the state were declared disaster areas. The depression also produced of rainfall in northern Georgia. Eighteen bridges were destroyed and twenty-seven others were damaged. In Virginia, 100 homes were destroyed by flooding, with about the same amount suffering major damage. Similar impact was reported in Tennessee. Strong winds and storm tides in New Jersey caused extensive damage. Overall, the flooding event caused 53 deaths, 39 in Georgia, 13 in North Carolina, and 1 in Tennessee. Damage totaled $203 million, $100 million of which was incurred in New Jersey alone.
=== Other systems ===

In addition to the six named storms and Tropical Depression Nine, a total of nine other tropical depressions developed during the season. Later in June, a tropical depression formed in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on June 13. It headed north-northwestward and made landfall in Texas by the following day. The system rapidly dissipated after moving inland. The third tropical depression of the season developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 17. After tracking northward, the depression struck near Mobile, Alabama on July 18. By the following day, it dissipated in central Mississippi. In late July, another depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 25. No further strengthening occurred and by the following day, it dissipated north of the Yucatán Peninsula.

A tropical depression developed near the west coast of Africa on August 1. The system tracked westward for three days without intensifying and dissipated on August 4. The next tropical depression formed well west-southwest of Cape Verde on September 17. After remaining disorganized, it dissipated to the east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles about three days later. Tropical Depression Four developed in the Bay of Campeche on September 22. However, the depression remained weak and made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas at around 1000 UTC on September 23. Later that day, it dissipated while barely inland.

By October 1, another tropical depression formed east of the Lesser Antilles. It headed west-northwestward and dissipated on October 3, before reaching the Windward Islands. Tropical Depression Six developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on October 2. It briefly headed east-southeastward, before curving northwestward on October 4. The system dissipated later that day. Another tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico east of the Texas and Mexico border on October 24. It tracked northeastward without intensification and made landfall in southeast Louisiana on October 25, while still a tropical depression. The system quickly weakened and dissipated over southern Mississippi later that day.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1977. Storms were named &quot;Anita&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot;, &quot;Clara&quot; and &quot;Evelyn&quot; for the first (and only, in the case of &quot;Anita&quot;) time this season. 

=== Retirement ===

The name &quot;Anita&quot; was later retired on account of the extensive damage it caused. It will never be used again for an Atlantic tropical cyclone.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1977 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1977 USD.

<doc id="791516" wikidata="Q2595181" url="?curid=791516" title="1978 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1978 Atlantic hurricane season was a slightly above average hurricane season in terms of number of named storms. Eleven tropical cyclones were named in all, and five of these became hurricanes; two of the five became a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale). This was also the last Atlantic hurricane season to use an all-female naming list. The season officially began on June 1, 1978, and ended on November 30, 1978. These dates, adopted by convention, denote the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic basin. However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as shown by the formation of an unnamed subtropical storm on January 18. 

Three storms made landfall along the coast of the western Gulf of Mexico during the season. At the end of July and into early August, short-lived Tropical Storm Amelia and its remnants caused extensive flooding in Texas after dropping as much as of rain. There were 33 deaths and US$110 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage. Also in August, Tropical Storm Bess made landfall in Veracruz, and later, Tropical Storm Debra did so in Louisiana. Neither caused significant damage, though Debra or its remnants spawned multiple tornadoes that killed two people. Hurricanes Ella and Greta each reached Category 4 strength. Though remaining out at sea, Ella did lash the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada with gusty winds and rip currents in early September. Greta brought strong winds, high tides, and flooding to Central America, particularly Belize and Honduras, resulting in about $25 million in damage and at least five fatalities. The storm crossed intact into the eastern Pacific Ocean and was renamed &quot;Olivia&quot;. Overall, the storms of this season collectively caused $191 million in damage and 42 fatalities.

== Season summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1978. Although 24 tropical cyclones developed, only twelve of them reached tropical storm intensity, which is slightly above the 1966-2009 average of 11.3 named storms per season. Of the twelve tropical storms, five of them strengthened into a hurricane, which is slightly below the 1966-2009 average of 6.2. Two of the five hurricane became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Three tropical storms and two hurricanes made landfall during the season. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the 1978 season caused at least 41 fatalities and $135 million. Additionally, the precursor to Hurricane Kendra brought flooding to Puerto Rico, with $6 million in damage and one death. The season officially ended on November 30, 1978.

Tropical cyclogenesis began very early, with the development of a subtropical storm on January 18. It dissipated about five days later. However, the next tropical cyclone, an unnumbered depression, did not develop until June 21. In July, there were two systems, including an unnumbered tropical depression and Tropical Storm Amelia. Seven tropical cyclones formed in August, including Tropical Depression Four, tropical storms Bess and Debra and hurricanes Cora and Ella. There were also seven systems in September – tropical depressions Eight, Nine, and Twelve, Tropical Storm Hope, and hurricanes Flossie and Greta. During the month of October, there were five tropical cyclones, with two unnumbered tropical depressions, tropical storms Irma and Juliet, and Hurricane Kendra. There was another unnumbered tropical depression in November, which dissipated on November 5.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 63. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Unnamed subtropical storm ===
In the middle of January, an upper-level trough in the westerlies spawned a surface low-pressure area to the east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles and to the south of a subtropical ridge. Isolated from the detrimental effects of the westerlies, it was initially non-tropical in nature and intensified through a baroclinic energy source, or one that derives energy from the interaction of cold and warm air. Convection increased slightly despite cool sea surface temperatures of around . At 1200 UTC on January 18, it organized into a subtropical depression about east-northeast of Puerto Rico while moving in a general westward track, which it would maintain for much of its duration. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated Dvorak classifications on the cyclone at 0000 UTC on January 19, assessing a Dvorak number of T2.5, suggesting both tropical and subtropical characteristics. On the same day, the pressure gradient between the storm and the ridge produced gale-force winds. By early on January 20, the storm maintained minimal convection near its center, with its primary rainband revolved in a cyclonic formation around its well-defined center. Later that day, the storm strengthened into a subtropical storm and attained peak winds of , supported by both ship and Hurricane Hunters reports.

After the storm maintained peak winds for about 36 hours, the outer rainbands to the south and east of the center began diminishing late on January 21, which began a weakening trend. At around that time, the cyclone was moving west-southwestward, and within 72 hours was forecast by one hurricane forecast model to be located over Hispaniola. By midday on January 22, the winds decreased to below gale force after the convection dissipated near the center. Subsequently, it turned more to the west away from land, and by January 23 the circulation degenerated into a remnant trough about north of the Lesser Antilles. The storm was one of six tropical or subtropical cyclones on record to be active in the month of January, and one of four to have formed in the month.
=== Tropical Storm Amelia ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 19. The wave did not develop significantly while crossing the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The disturbance then entered an area of the Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became a tropical depression while located about south of Brownsville, Texas on July 30. Despite its proximity to land, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Amelia on July 31 and peaked with winds of . Around that time, Amelia made landfall near Port Isabel, Texas. Later on July 31, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated early the following day.

Amelia affected the Texas coast for two days, causing several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Overall, Amelia caused 33 fatalities with an estimated $110 million in damages.
=== Tropical Storm Bess ===

A low-pressure area developed in Georgia along a dissipating cold front on August 1. The system detached from the cold front and drifted southwestward, reaching northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 3. Satellite imagery, buoys, and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that by August 5, the system likely acquired a closed circulation. Thus, the National Hurricane Center estimated that a tropical depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC that day. On August 6, a reconnaissance flight into the depression resulted in an upgrade to Tropical Storm Bess, while located about southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The storm had initially headed west-southwestward at , before moving southwestward at nearly the same speed.

At 1200 UTC on August 7, Bess attained its minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, Bess began to turn nearly due southward under the influence of a high-pressure area over southern Texas. Later on August 7, the storm reached its maximum sustained winds of . Early on August 8, Bess made landfall near Nautla, Veracruz, at the same intensity and then rapidly dissipated inland. In Tuxpan, Veracruz and Tampico, Tamaulipas, sustained winds reached only . The storm also produced heavy rainfall, peaking at in La Estrella. However, no flooding occurred and no damage or fatalities were reported. Its remnants emerged into the Pacific Ocean, leading to the formation of Hurricane Iva.
=== Hurricane Cora ===

On August 4, a disturbance exited the west coast of Africa and moved quickly westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Two days later, the system broke away from the ICTZ, when it started organizing. It developed into Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. A day later it intensified into Tropical Storm on August 8. The storm quickly intensified and developed a well-defined eye feature. The NHC upgraded Cora to hurricane status, marking only the second time that an Atlantic hurricane was upgraded solely based on satellite photography; the first was Doris in 1975. The NHC estimated that Cora attained peak winds of early on August 9. For much of its duration, Cora moved quickly to the west-southwest toward the Lesser Antilles. Possibly as a result of the fast forward motion, the hurricane weakened soon after reaching its peak intensity, dropping to tropical storm status on August 10. That day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft encountered the weakening storm. Cora struck the island of Grenada on August 11 while weakening to a tropical depression. Cora degenerated into a tropical wave on August 12 in the eastern Caribbean. The remnant crossed over Central America into the Pacific Ocean, where it regenerated into Hurricane Kristy.

While passing through the Lesser Antilles, Cora produced wind gusts to , along with light rainfall in Barbados and Saint Lucia. In the latter, a person died after stepping on a high tension power line that was downed in Castries. Approximately two to four percent of trees on the island were toppled. Although it remained far to the south, Hurricane Cora affected weather conditions that reached as far north as Presque Isle, Maine, where balloonists Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman were preparing to make the first ever balloon flight on the Double Eagle II. The winds created by Cora&#x27;s influence would give the hot air balloon the northerly push required for takeoff.
=== Tropical Storm Debra ===
A low-pressure area that developed over southeast Florida and an area of convection near the Yucatán Peninsula merged and resulted in the formation of a tropical depression over the southern Gulf of Mexico on August 26. Tacking west-northwestward around a high-pressure ridge, the depression gradually intensified began and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra on August 28. Debra turned to the north and reached its peak intensity of on August 29, shortly before making landfall in southwestern Louisiana. It was a disorganized storm, with most of the convection located to the east of the center. The system weakened rapidly and dissipated over Arkansas on August 29, though its remnants continued into the Ohio Valley.

One person died while attempting to evacuate an oil rig to the south of Cameron, Louisiana. Damage caused by Debra was considered minimal. In Louisiana, rainfall peaked at in Freshwater Bayou. However, no flooding was reported. Wind impacts were light and mainly limited to down trees and damage to roofs in Lake Charles and New Orleans. The storm spawned several tornadoes in Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas. In Mississippi, a tornado in Crystal Springs destroyed three mobile homes and a house, killing one person and seriously injuring another.
=== Hurricane Ella ===
A cold front spawned a tropical disturbance near Bermuda, which became a tropical depression on August 30. The depression strengthened, and by early on August 31, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ella. Ship reports indicated that Ella became a hurricane later that day. Further significant intensification occurred, and the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity of . A short-wave trough over the Eastern United States caused Ella to decelerate and turn north. Simultaneously, dry air diminished convection on September 2, which in turn resulted in weakening. Eventually, another trough forced Ella to re-curve northeastward, thereby remaining well offshore the East Coast of the United States.

The storm then re-intensified and by 1200 UTC on September 4, Ella peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of . Thereafter, Ella rapidly weakened as it passed offshore Atlantic Canada, before being absorbed by an extratropical storm while located more than northeast of St. John&#x27;s on September 5. Ella threatened to pass within of North Carolina. Because of this, a hurricane watch was issued for the Outer Banks of North Carolina during Labor Day Weekend, resulting in a significant decrease in tourism. However, because the storm veered northeastward, little effects other than waves, minor beach erosion, and light winds in coastal portions of North Carolina. In Newfoundland, Ella produced rainfall amounts reaching and wind gusts up to .
=== Hurricane Flossie ===

A tropical wave passed westward across Dakar, Senegal on August 31 and entered the Atlantic Ocean later that day. Convection markedly increased over the next few days and by 0000 UTC on September 4, the wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Later that day, the &quot;Hong Kong Merchant&quot; reported tropical storm force winds, thus the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. It initially tracked northwestward at and minimal strengthening occurred, possibly due to rapid forward speeds. On September 5, the storm curved westward, until turning north on September 7. A high-pressure area transitioned into a trough, causing Flossie to re-curve northeastward and generating strong upper-level winds.

On September 8, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression. After the trough began weakening, favorable conditions returned, allowing Flossie to re-strengthen into a tropical storm on September 10. Flossie then decelerated and became nearly stationary on September 12. Around that time, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. Further intensification continued, and Flossie peaked with winds of early on September 13. The storm began turned nearly due northward and began weakening. Flossie accelerated to the northeast and eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while north of the Azores on September 15. The strong extratropical cyclone brought winds as high as to Fair Isle, Great Britain.
=== Hurricane Greta ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near Trinidad on September 13. By the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Greta. It headed westward to west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and slowly intensified, becoming a hurricane on September 16. The rate of intensification increased as Greta was approaching the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Greta briefly peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of , while brushing northeastern Honduras. Although the storm remained offshore, land interaction caused significant weakening. On September 19, Greta made landfall in Stann Creek District, Belize with winds of . The storm rapidly weakened inland over Central America, but survived its passage and eventually became Hurricane Olivia in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

Early in its duration, Greta produced heavy rainfall in the Netherlands Antilles. With a similar path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta threatened to reproduce the devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200 homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, and there was one death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125 houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25 million, and there were four deaths.
=== Tropical Storm Hope ===

A mid-tropospheric low-pressure area developed over the Southeastern United States on September 10. The system developed into a subtropical depression early on September 12, while located about east of St. Augustine, Florida. Over the next few days, the depression tracked east-northeastward to eastward. While strengthening into a subtropical storm on September 15, it passed just north of Bermuda, but produced only of rain on the island. The storm then made a brief dip to the east-southeast, before resuming its east-northeastward course on September 16. Beginning on the following day, satellite imagery indicated that the system was acquiring tropical characteristics. As a result, it was reclassified as Tropical Storm Hope at 0600 UTC on September 17.

Because Hope remained out of range of reconnaissance aircraft flights, the National Hurricane Center relied on ships and satellite estimates. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hope began to accelerate while slowly intensifying. Satellite estimates at 1200 UTC on September 19 indicated that the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of , recorded by the &quot;S.S. Banglar Mann&quot;. While located hundreds of miles north of the Azores on September 20, the storm turned northward and began crossing into sea surface temperatures of . By 1200 UTC on September 21, Hope transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was absorbed by another extratropical storm while situated about south of Reykjavík, Iceland.
=== Tropical Storm Irma ===

The origins of Tropical Storm Irma were from a subtropical depression that formed about south of the Azores on October 2. During the next two days, thunderstorm activity gradually increased around the circulation center as the storm drifted northward. On October 2, the storm had taken the appearance of a tropical storm on satellite photographs, and upper-level anticyclonic flow over the center of the storm was evident on satellite time-lapse movies. By the afternoon of October 4, the system had acquired the characteristics of a tropical storm and was named Irma; gale-force winds extended from the center of circulation.

Six hours after being named, Irma reached its peak intensity of . On October 5, Irma turned towards the north-northeast and passed about midway between the central and western Azores. Shortly thereafter, Irma became less organized, and that evening was absorbed into an approaching cold front, about northeast of the Azores. Although Irma passed near parts of the western and central Azores with gale-force winds in some areas, no reports of damage or casualties caused by Irma were received. Several nearby ships reported winds around . It was noted that heavy rains may have occurred on some of the mountainous islands as Irma passed.
=== Tropical Storm Juliet ===

A weak tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 30. The wave moved west-northwestward and was centered well east of the Leeward Islands on October 6, when satellite imagery indicated that deep convection became much more concentrated. The following day, ship reports noted that a closed circulation was developing. The system was classified as a tropical depression beginning at 1800 UTC on October 7, while located about east of Puerto Rico. Around midday on October 8, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Juliet.

After peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of early on October 9, Juliet passed north of Puerto Rico. The storm brought light rainfall to the island, peaking at at Toro Negro Plant. The storm then accelerated and curved northwestward, northward, and then northeastward. On October 11, Juliet merged with a frontal zone, while located west-southwest of Bermuda. Later that day, the remnants moved across the island and produced up to of rainfall.
=== Hurricane Kendra ===

In late October, a tropical wave and an area of disturbed weather combined in the northwestern Caribbean, before crossing Puerto Rico. The system moved northwest and by late on October 28, it became a tropical depression while located about north of Mayaguana in The Bahamas. Early on the following day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kendra. The storm quickly intensified while moving either north or north-northwestward and became a hurricane late on October 29. After peaking with winds of on October 30, Kendra weakened significantly to a tropical storm in only 12 hours. Kendra continued north-northeastward or northeastward, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while located west-northwest of Bermuda early on November 1.

The precursor system dropped rainfall across much of southern Puerto Rico was at least , with a peak at in Pico del Este. Mudslides and flooding from the heavy precipitation left many roads impassable, washed out or collapsed several bridges, and caused considerable damage to agriculture, especially livestock. Additionally, one fatality occurred and 1,710 families fled their homes for shelters. Damage in Puerto Rico reached $6 million. A high-pressure area and Kendra combined produced strong winds and abnormally high tides along the East Coast of the United States, though no damage was reported.
=== Other systems ===
In addition to the 12 other tropical cyclones, there were several tropical depressions that developed during the season. The first of which formed over the central Gulf of Mexico on June 21. The depression moved northeastward toward Florida and strengthened slightly. It dissipated by late on June 22. Another tropical depression developed about southwest of Porto Novo, Cape Verde on July 10. The system moved generally westward and intensified into a strong tropical depression, before dissipating two days later. Tropical Depression Four formed about east of Barbados on August 7. It tracked westward without significantly intensifying, and passed through the Windward Islands over Bequia on the following day. The depression continued westward and passed near Aruba on August 9. It eventually traversed the Caribbean Sea, and made landfall to the south of Bluefields, Nicaragua on August 11. The depression dissipated shortly thereafter.

A tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico on August 9. The storm moved northward and struck southeastern Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana before dissipating the next day. By August 30, another depression developed in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. The system tracked generally eastward and avoided landfall. It dissipated around midday on September 1. Tropical Depression Eight developed over western Senegal around 1200 UTC on September 3. The depression initially headed west-southwestward and soon entered the Atlantic Ocean. Between late on September 4 and early on September 5, the system passed south of Cape Verde. Later that day, the storm began curving west-northwestward. By early on September 7, it was heading northwestward and then turned to the north-northwest the next day. The depression moved northward between September 9 and September 10, before re-curving to the northeast. It dissipated about of Flores Island in the Azores around midday on September 11.

At 1200 UTC on September 8, Tropical Depression Nine developed over the west-central Gulf of Mexico. Moving generally westward, the depression made landfall south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas, around midday on September 10. The system rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day. Another tropical depression formed over western Senegal on September 18. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean before curving west-northwestward about three days later. On September 25, the depression moved northwestward and then northward by September 28. It dissipated about east-northeast of Bermuda at 1200 UTC the following day. The next tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore Campeche on September 21. Moving west-northwestward, the depression made landfall near Tampico on September 23, shortly before dissipating.

A tropical depression formed at 1200 UTC on October 13, while located about north of Corvo Island in the Azores. The depression initially moved south-southwestward, before curving southwestward by the following day. It then turned west-northwestward on October 15. Late the next day, the depression turned abruptly northward. The system dissipated about west-northwest of Flores Island. The next tropical depression developed at 1200 UTC on October 26, while located about south-southwest of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. It moved generally westward and dissipated about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa on October 29. The final tropical depression of the season formed about northeast of North Abaco in the Bahamas on November 3. Moving north-northeastward, the depression turned northeastward by the next day. It dissipated about east of Virginia Beach, Virginia on November 5.

== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1978. Storms were named &quot;Amelia&quot;, &quot;Bess&quot;, &quot;Cora&quot;, &quot;Flossie&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Irma&quot;, and &quot;Juliet&quot; for the first time in 1978. This was the last Atlantic hurricane season to utilize only female names for tropical storms.
This was the last time this list was used due to the 6 year rotational name lists that came in 1979, resulting in this list being discarded 
=== Retirement ===

The name &quot;Greta&quot; was retired after the 1978 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1978 USD.

<text>The 1979 Atlantic hurricane season was the first Atlantic hurricane season to include both male and female names on its list of tropical cyclone names. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was slightly below average, with nine systems reaching tropical storm intensity. The first system, an unnumbered tropical depression, developed north of Puerto Rico on June 9. Two days later, Tropical Depression One formed and produced severe flooding in Jamaica, with 41 deaths and about $27 million (1979 USD) in damage. Tropical Storm Ana caused minimal impact in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Bob spawned tornadoes and produced minor wind damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States, primarily in Louisiana, while the remnants caused flooding, especially in Indiana. Tropical Storm Claudette caused extensive flooding in Texas due to torrential rainfall, resulting in two deaths and about $750 million in damage.

The most intense tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane David. It moved across the Lesser Antilles in late August, with the worst hit islands being Dominica and Martinique. The storm then strengthened further and struck Dominican Republic as a Category 5 hurricane. David was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone to make landfall in that country since 1930. In Dominican Republic alone, the system caused approximately 1,000 deaths and $1 billion in damage. Later, David brought wind damage, tornadoes, and flooding to portions of the East Coast of the United States. Overall, the storm resulted in 2,068 deaths and $1.54 billion in damage. Hurricane Frederic brought destruction to the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially in Alabama and Mississippi.

Tropical Storm Elena brought flooding to the Greater Houston area, with five deaths and about $10 million in damage. However, little impact was reported elsewhere. Hurricane Henri remained offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and disrupted efforts to stop the Ixtoc I oil spill. Henri also caused flooding in portions of Mexico. In mid and late-September, a tropical depression caused flooding in the Southern United States, especially Texas. Four deaths were reported, two in Texas and two in Kentucky. Toward the end of October, a brief hurricane force subtropical storm struck Newfoundland, but left little impact. Other than Tropical Depression One and the tropical depression that brought flooding to the Southern United States in mid and late-September, none of the other depressions caused significant effects of land. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.12 billion in damage and at least 2,136 deaths.

== Seasonal summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1979. Although 26 tropical systems were observed, only 16 reached the level of tropical or subtropical depression, and nine of them reached tropical storm intensity, which is slightly below the 1950-2000 average of 9.6 named storms per season. Of the nine tropical storms, five of them strengthened into a hurricane, which is also slightly below average. Two of the five hurricanes became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Three tropical storms, one hurricane-strength subtropical storm, and three hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 2,136 fatalities and $4.12 billion. Despite its intensity, Tropical Depression One also resulted in damage and deaths due to severe flooding in Jamaica. The last storm of the season, an unnumbered tropical depression, dissipated on November 15, about 15 days before the official end of hurricane season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with three tropical depressions, one of which strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. A total of four systems formed in the month of July, including Hurricane Bob and Tropical Storm Claudette. Activity briefly halted after Tropical Depression Six dissipated on August 6 and lasted until Hurricane David developed on August 25. There were four other tropical cyclones that month, including Hurricane Frederic and Tropical Storm Elena. In September, six systems developed, with the named storms of the month being hurricane Gloria and Henri. October was slightly less active, with four tropical cyclones, one of which was an unnamed subtropical storm. Two additional tropical depressions developed in November, the second of which dissipated on November 15.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 93. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===
A tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea situated south of Grand Cayman developed into a tropical depression on June 11. Tracking generally northward, the depression passed west of Jamaica. On June 12, the depression peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) system, having never reached tropical storm status. The following day, it made landfall in Cuba. Early on June 14, the depression emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean and then moved parallel to the east coast of Florida for a few days. The depression made another landfall in South Carolina on June 16 and dissipated hours later.

The slow movement of the depression to the west of Jamaica resulted in torrential rainfall, peaking at in Friendship, a city in Westmoreland Parish. Throughout western Jamaica, about 1,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, while up to 40,000 people were rendered homeless. The city of New Market was submerged for at least six months. Crops, electricity, telephones, buildings, and railways also suffered damage during the disaster. There were 40 deaths and approximately $27 million in damage. The depression also brought heavy precipitation to the Bahamas and Cuba. Along the East Coast of the United States, light rainfall, strong winds, and rough seas were observed. In South Carolina, a person went missing and was later presumed to have drowned after their boat was torn loose from its mooring.
=== Tropical Storm Ana ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic on June 14. It headed westward and after satellite imagery indicated a closed circulation, the wave was classified as a tropical depression on June 19, while located several hundred miles east-southeast of the Windward Islands. The system was the first tropical cyclone to develop east of the Lesser Antilles in June since the 1933 Trinidad hurricane.

A United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft noted that the depression was strengthening and by early on June 22, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ana. Thereafter, the storm began tracking almost due westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Ana peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), before wind shear began detaching deep convection from the center, resulting in weakening. Early on June 23, the storm struck St. Lucia and then fell to tropical depression intensity upon entering the Caribbean Sea. Ana continued weakening and degenerated back into a tropical wave on June 24, while located between Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Despite directly crossing St. Lucia, only light rainfall occurred. In Dominica, rain fell for 15 hours and gusty winds were reported.
=== Hurricane Bob ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on July 9. Tracking in a general northward direction, favorable conditions allowed for quick strengthening. Less than a day after formation, the system reached tropical storm intensity, thus being named Tropical Storm Bob and becoming the first Atlantic tropical storm with a male name, followed by hurricane intensity on July 11. Shortly after strengthening into a hurricane, Bob reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of . At the same intensity, Bob made landfall west of Grand Isle, Louisiana, and rapidly weakened after moving inland. However, the resulting tropical depression persisted for several days as it paralleled the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. On July 16, the system emerged into the western Atlantic, where it was subsequently absorbed by a nearby low-pressure area.

Widespread offshore and coastal evacuations took place along the Gulf Coast of the United States in preparation for Hurricane Bob. Effects from the hurricane on the United States were mostly marginal and typical of a minimal hurricane. The cyclone produced a moderate storm surge, damaging some coastal installments and causing coastal inundation. Strong winds were also associated with Bob&#x27;s landfall, though no stations observed winds of hurricane force. The winds downed trees and blew out windows, in addition to causing widespread power outages. Heavy rainfall was also reported in some locations, peaking at in Louisiana. Further inland, the torrential rains led to flooding in Indiana, resulting in more considerable damage as opposed to the coast. Bob also spawned eight tornadoes, with two causing significant damage. Overall, Bob was responsible for one death and $20 million in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Claudette ===
A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on July 16. It gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. As the storm approached Puerto Rico early on July 18, it weakened back to a tropical depression. Claudette degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. Late on July 18, the remnants struck the Dominican Republic and emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. The system crossed western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and regenerated into a tropical cyclone. By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward. The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border later that day. It eventually dissipated over West Virginia on July 29.

In the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to several islands. Minor flooding occurred in Saint Croix. Rainfall exceeding 10 inches (250 mm) in some areas of Puerto Rico led to widespread agricultural damage, flooded homes and streets. There was one fatality and approximately $750,000 in damage. Up to of rain fell in one day in Alvin, Texas, which is the record 24‑hour precipitation amount for any location in the United States. Within the state of Texas alone, hundreds of businesses and an estimated 15,000 homes sustained flood damage. Rice crops were also ruined. One drowning death was reported in the state. In Louisiana, extensive coastal flooding occurred, with miles of roads battered or destroyed in Cameron Parish, while several boats along the coast capsized. At Johnson Bayou, fishing camps and homes suffered damage or destruction. Further inland, other states experienced freshwater flooding, especially Indiana and Missouri. Overall, Claudette was responsible for two deaths and $750 million in losses.
=== Hurricane David ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on August 25, while located about southeast of Cape Verde. Moving westward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm David early the next day. Shortly after attaining hurricane status on August 27, David rapidly deepened. By 12:00 UTC the following day, it was a strong Category 4 hurricane. Thereafter, the storm oscillated in intensity while approaching the Lesser Antilles and struck Dominica late on August 29 with winds 145 mph (230 km/h). After entering the Caribbean Sea, further deepening occurred and at 18:00 UTC on August 30, David peaked with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). Late on August 31, it curved northwestward and struck Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic at the same intensity.

The storm rapidly weakened while crossing Hispaniola and was only a Category 1 hurricane upon emerging into the Windward Passage on September 1. Moving northwestward, David made landfall in the eastern tip of Cuba that day and briefly weakened to a tropical storm. However, after reaching the Atlantic, it re-strengthened into a Category 1. David then moved through the Bahamas and crossed Andros Island on September 2. Thereafter, the storm re-intensified into a Category 2 and made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida late the next day. The hurricane remained barely inland and re-emerged into the Atlantic at Merritt Island early on September 4. Thereafter, the cyclone weakened slightly and made landfall in Blackbeard Island, Georgia later that day as a Category 1 hurricane. David headed north-northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm on September 5. While crossing the Mid-Atlantic states, the storm curved northeastward and accelerated, before becoming extratropical over New York late on September 6. The remnants of David persisted over New England and Atlantic Canada, before dissipating northeast of Newfoundland on September 8.

In Dominica, strong winds damaged or destroyed 80% of homes, leaving 75% of the island&#x27;s population homeless. Agricultural was also severely impacted, with 75% of crops ruined, including a complete loss of bananas. There were 56 deaths and 180 injuries. Similar destruction occurred on Guadeloupe and Martinique, with hundreds left homeless and extensive damage to crops. Guadeloupe and Martinique also had $50 million and $100 million in damage, respectively. In Puerto Rico, flooding and high winds combined resulted in $70 million in damage and seven fatalities, four from electrocution. Dominican Republic was lashed with very strong winds and torrential rains. Entire villages were destroyed and numerous others were left isolated because of damage or destruction to many roads. Thousands of houses were destroyed, leaving over 200,000 homeless in the aftermath of the hurricane. Additionally, nearly 70% of the country&#x27;s crops were ruined. Overall, the storm caused at least 2,000 deaths and about $1 billion in damage in Dominican Republic. Minimal impact occurred in the Bahamas, Cuba, and Haiti. In Florida, strong winds left moderate damage, including a downed radio tower, snapping a crane, and deroofing buildings. There were also 10 tornadoes. Damage totaled approximately $95 million. Other states along the East Coast of the United States experienced flooding and tornadoes. The latter was particularly severe in Virginia, with tornadoes causing one death, damaging 270 homes, and destroying three other homes. Throughout the United States, there were 15 deaths and about $320 million in damage.
=== Tropical Depression Eight ===

A tropical disturbance formed over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on August 24. By the following day, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression, operationally classified as the eight of the season. The depression entered the Bay of Campeche on August 25 and headed northward. Around 06:00 UTC the following day, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). However, on August 28, a ridge of high pressure forced the system to move west-southwestward, causing it make landfall in a rural area of Tamaulipas later that day. The depression brought heavy rainfall to some areas of Mexico, with of precipitation observed in Santa María Xadani, Oaxaca. Rainfall extended northward into Texas, peaking at in McAllen.
=== Hurricane Frederic ===
Satellite imagery and ship observations indicated that a tropical depression developed at 06:00 UTC on August 29, while located about south-southwest of the southernmost island of Cape Verde. By 12:00 UTC the next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Frederic. Further intensification occurred, with the storm becoming a hurricane on September 1. However, outflow from Hurricane David caused Fredric to weaken back to a tropical storm early the following day. While moving across the northern Leeward Islands on September 4, bringing gusty winds and heavy rainfall to some islands. In Sint Maarten, a fishing boat sank, killing seven people. Strong winds were observed in the United States Virgin Islands. On Saint Thomas, the roofs of three large apartment buildings were blown off, leaving about 50 families homeless. Additionally, flooding destroyed four houses and impacted 50 others. Numerous houses on Saint Croix also suffered water damage.

Around midday on September 4, Frederic made landfall in Humacao, Puerto Rico with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Flooding on the island forced over 6,000 people to flee their homes in search of shelter. Numerous roads were closed due to landslides and inundation. At least nine cities experienced flooding. After crossing Puerto Rico, Frederic briefly re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea, before making landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) at 00:00 UTC on September 6. Minimal impact was reported in that country, though heavy rainfall, exceeding in some places, compounded damage inflicted by Hurricane David. Frederic weakened further while crossing Hispaniola. Later on September 6, the system briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, but land interaction with the island weakened it to a tropical depression. The storm crossed the Windward Passage and then made landfall in southeastern Guantánamo Province of Cuba early on September 7. Due to the weak nature of Frederic, minimal impact was reported. It then moved along, or just offshore the southern coast of Cuba. While situated south of Matanzas Province early on September 9, the system re-strengthened into a tropical storm. Despite land interaction with Cuba, Frederic continued to intensify.

Shortly before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, Frederic re-intensified into a hurricane. During the next few days, the storm significantly, but not rapidly, strengthened while moving northwestward. At 12:00 UTC on September 12, Frederic attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on the next day, the storm made landfall near Dauphin Island and then near the Alabama–Mississippi state line. The storm rapidly weakened and fell to tropical storm intensity by late on September 13. Frederic then accelerated northeastward and became extratropical over New York around 18:00 UTC the next day. The remnants persisted until dissipating over New Brunswick early on September 15. Frederic brought destruction to the Gulf Coast of the United States. In Alabama, storm surge up to and wind gusts as high as caused the destruction of nearly all buildings within of the coast. In the Mobile, nearly 90% of the city lost electricity. Extensive coastal damage was also reported in Mississippi, due to tides ranging from above normal. Hundreds of structures were severely impacted or destroyed. Throughout the United States, the storm caused five deaths and approximately $1.7 billion in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Elena ===
On August 27, a weak tropical wave crossed Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Upon reaching the central Gulf of Mexico, ships, buoys, and satellite observations indicated that a tropical depression developed early on August 30, while located about halfway between the southeastern tip of Louisiana and the north coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. A reconnaissance aircraft flight confirmed the existence of a tropical depression. Late on August 30, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Elena. Early the next day, Elena peaked with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .

Around 12:00 UTC on September 1, the storm made landfall near Matagorda, Texas with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Elena rapidly weakened to a tropical depression about six hours later, before dissipating early on September 2. Due to the weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. In Texas, precipitation peaked at at Palacios Municipal Airport. Flooding occurred, with the worst impact in Harris County. Hundreds of cars were stalled or submerged in downtown Houston and 45 buses suffered water damage. Basements and the police station were also inundated. Elsewhere in the county, some homes and businesses were flooded. Elena caused five deaths and less than $10 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Gloria ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and developed into a tropical depression by September 4. Under the influence of a trough in the westerlies, the depression northeastward and bypassed Cape Verde on September 5. At 12:00 UTC on the following day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gloria, while moving west-northwestward at about . After curving abruptly north-northwestward, Gloria became a hurricane early on September 7. A higher latitude frontal system and a high pressure area caused Gloria to decelerate and resulted in a westward motion beginning on September 9.

Gloria briefly weakened to a tropical storm late on September 10, but re-strengthened into a hurricane on the following day. Eventually, the hurricane turned northeastward and began to accelerate. At 1800 UTC on September 12, Gloria attained its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm then began weakening and fell to Category 1 hurricane intensity on September 13. During that time, Gloria slowly began merging with a low pressure area that was located north of the Azores and lost tropical characteristics by September 15. Gloria was centered well north of Flores Island in the Azores, at the time.
=== Hurricane Henri ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near the Yucatan Peninsula on September 15. It quickly entered the Gulf of Mexico and turned westward. As the depression was curving southwestward on September 16, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henri. Thereafter, Henri decelerated and continued to intensify, becoming a hurricane on September 17. Later that day, as it was turning northwestward, the hurricane peaked with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . A nearby low pressure area caused Henri to move erratically. Henri began weakening due to land interaction with Mexico and it was downgraded back to a tropical storm on September 18.

By September 19, Henri doubled-back southeastward while weakening to a tropical depression. The depression lost much of its convection and curved northeastward on September 20, ahead of a cold front. Henri turned east-northeastward on September 23 and was absorbed by a frontal low pressure trough in the east-central Gulf of Mexico on the following day. This was a rare example of a storm entering the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating without making landfall. Henri disrupted cleanup efforts from the Ixtoc I oil spill by damaging a cap designed to stop oil from flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. Although it remained offshore, the storm brought heavy rainfall to Mexico, peaking at , forcing at least 2,000 people from their homes in Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche.
=== Unnumbered tropical depression ===

This system formed as a non-tropical low within a pre-existing area of heavy thunderstorms along a stationary front on September 19 off the coast of Brownsville, Texas. The low appeared to the northwest of Tropical Storm Henri in the Gulf of Mexico and to the east of a cold-core low over Arizona and New Mexico. The low became a non-tropical gale center on September 20, while moving into southeast Texas. The cyclone continued northeastward and dissipating over Tennessee. Sources differ on the status of this storm, with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initially considering it a tropical depression, while the National Climatic Data Center considered the system non-tropical and it is not included in the Atlantic hurricane best track.

The depression brought heavy rainfall to Texas, with of precipitation between Corpus Christi and southwestern Louisiana. Severe flooding occurred, especially in Brazoria, Galveston, Harris, Nueces, and San Patricio counties. In Harris County alone, nearly 1,950 homes and hundreds of cars were flooded. Two deaths were reported in Texas, both from drowning. Portions of western Louisiana experienced , resulting in severe flooding, with the worst impacted parishes being Allen, Calcasieu, and Rapides. Collectively, 1,400 homes, businesses, and schools were flooded in the three parishes, while of crops were inundated. In Mississippi, locally strong winds caused minor damage. Flooding to a lesser extend was also reported in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia. Two additional deaths occurred in Kentucky.
=== Subtropical Storm One ===
A frontal wave formed about south-southwest of Bermuda in response to a short wave in the westerlies on October 23. After satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with the system was becoming increasingly concentrated, a subtropical depression developed 12:00 UTC. The subtropical depression moved rapidly north-northeastward and strengthened into a subtropical storm early on October 24, based on satellite imagery classification. Accelerating to a forward speed of , the storm intensified further and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) – equivalent to a minimal Category 1 hurricane – at 18:00 UTC on October 24.

Early on October 25, the system attained its minimum barometric pressure of . The storm already began weakening and losing tropical characteristics after tracking away from the Gulf Stream. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone made landfall near Rose Blanche-Harbour le Cou, Newfoundland, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). By the time it re-emerged into the Atlantic later on October 25, the system had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Rainfall spread across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 2.91 in (74 mm) on northeastern Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia.
=== Other systems ===
The first tropical depression of the season developed north of Puerto Rico on June 9. It headed northward without intensifying and dissipated near Bermuda on the following day. Tropical Depression One existed in June from June 11 to June 16. Another tropical depression developed north of Hispaniola on July 8. It headed northward and then curved northeastward, bypass during the process. By July 13, the depression dissipated while located well south of Newfoundland. A day after the previous tropical depression developed, another depression formed near 10th parallel in the eastern Atlantic on July 9. It headed due westward and dissipated on July 11. A tropical depression formed offshore of Georgia July 10. The system moved north of due east with slight intensification on July 11. It turned east, passing south of Bermuda early on the morning of July 13 while accelerating eastward, with the depression dissipating that afternoon. A tropical depression formed offshore western Africa on July 20. The system moved westward through Cape Verde as a weak system on July 22. The system turned west-northwest and by late on July 25, the depression began to weaken as it turned more to the north, and the system dissipated well to the east-southeast of Bermuda on July 26. Tropical Depression Six developed east of the Lesser Antilles on July 28. The depression moved to the northwest and bypassed Bermuda on August 4. The depression made landfall on the southeastern tip of Newfoundland on August 5 after passing southeast of Nova Scotia earlier that day. Tropical Depression Six became an extratropical cyclone while southeast of Labrador on August 6.

Tropical Depression Eight formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 25. Moving generally northwest, the depression moved into Mexico just south of the international border with the United States late on August 27. Early on the following day, it dissipated inland. In Brownsville, Texas, rainfall accumulations totaled to on August 27, which was a record amount of precipitation for that date. The last tropical depression in August developed offshore of The Carolinas on August 29. The system quickly moved east-northeast between the East coast North America and Bermuda over the next couple days. The depression became a frontal wave southeast of Newfoundland on September 1, and dissipated soon afterward. Early in September, a tropical depression formed northeast of Cape Verde on September 1. The depression moved west-northwest before recurving sharply while located near the 40th meridian west on September 4. Steadily weakening thereafter over cool waters, the depression dissipated southeast of the Azores on September 6. A tropical depression formed near Cape Verde on September 16 and initially moved northwestward. Once it passed the 50th meridian west, the system turned northward and passed between Bermuda and the Azores. Turning northeast on September 20, the system became an extratropical cyclone, passing northwest of the Azores before dissipating on September 21. A tropical depression formed in the tropical north Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. The system moved northwest over the next few days, staying well east of the Leeward Islands, before dissipating on September 24.

Tropical Depression Fourteen formed on October 12 near Honduras and slowly moved to the northeast towards Cuba. The depression remained south of Cuba and turned back towards the Yucatan Peninsula. The depression made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on October 20 and dissipated shortly thereafter. Impact from the depression in this region is unknown. Toward the end of October, a tropical depression formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic on October 22. It moved northwest over the next six days, dissipating on October 28 to the southwest of the Azores. The last tropical depression in October developed near Panama on October 24. The depression initially moved northward toward Cuba, but eventually veered southwestward. By October 29, the depression made landfall in Nicaragua and dissipated several hours later. Impact from this system in Central America is unknown. A subtropical depression formed from an old weather front, or baroclinic zone, on November 6 near Puerto Rico. The depression moved northeastward but appeared to have made contact with the westerlies, as it turned off to the east-northeast. Ships that passed through the system recorded winds of 35-40 mph (55–65 km/h). Early on November 10, the system degenerated to a low pressure area, which soon dissipated. The final tropical depression of the season formed northeast of the Greater Antilles along a frontal zone on November 13. The depression completed a quick recurvature over the next couple days without significant changes in intensity. By November 15, the depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1979. This was the first Atlantic hurricane season to utilize both female and male names for tropical storms. Storms were named &quot;Ana&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Claudette&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Frederic&quot;, and &quot;Henri&quot; for the first (and, in the cases of &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Frederic&quot;, only) time in 1979. The names &quot;Elena&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; were previously used under the old naming convention.

=== Retirement ===

In the spring of 1980, the World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Frederic&quot; from its rotating name lists due to the deaths and damage they caused, and they will not be used again in the North Atlantic. They were replaced with &quot;Danny&quot; and &quot;Fabian&quot;, respectively, for the 1985 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1979 USD.

<text>Kværner was a Norwegian engineering and construction services company that existed between 1853 and 2005.

During its initial decades, the firm was involved in the manufacture of cast iron stoves and hydroelectric turbines. The turbine business was Kværner&#x27;s leading product throughout the first half of the twentieth century, although it had also branched out into the production of bridges, cranes, and pumps. Kværner underwent a spree of international acquisitions during the 1990s, which included Govan Shipbuilders, Götaverken, Trafalgar House, Vyborg Shipyard; its headquarters were also relocated from Oslo to London during this decade. However, the heavy debt burden built up by acquiring these businesses, some of which were actually unprofitable, jeopardised the company&#x27;s continued existence by the start of the twenty-first century.

Efforts to stabilise the company included the selling off of Cunard Line and its construction division, as well as the receipt of financial support from senior figures within the Russian oil company Yukos. However, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Kværner was compelled to merge with its long time rival Aker ASA. During 2004, Kværner was amalgamated into the newly formed subsidiary of Aker ASA - Aker Kværner, which was renamed Aker Solutions on 3 April 2008.

On 6 May 2011, Kværner re-emerged when the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) part of Aker Solutions took the Kværner name. The new Kværner company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 8 July 2011. However, during 2020, Aker Solutions opted to restructure and merge with Kvaerne.

==History==
Kvaerner Brug was founded in Oslo in 1853 by industrialist Oluf A. Onsum (1820-1899). Early on, the primary activity of the business was its involvement in the production of cast iron stoves. In 1870, Kvaerner built its first hydroelectric turbine. During the early 1900s, Kvaerner power turbines remained the principal product line, which also included bridges, cranes, and pumps. Kvaerner was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 1967. By the 1990s, the company assembled a collection of engineering and industrial businesses, including shipbuilding, construction of offshore oil and gas platforms, production of pulping and paper manufacturing equipment, and operation of a shipping fleet.

Directors-general of Kværner after the stock exchange listing were Kjell B. Langballe (1960–1976), Carl Røtjer (1976–1986) and Mikal H. Grønner (1986–1989). Chairmen were Frithjof A. Lind (–1982), Johan B. Holte (1982–1985), Emil Eriksrud (1985–1986), Carl Røtjer (1986–1989), Kaspar Kielland (1989-1996), and then Christian Bjelland (1996-2001). Since 2011, the CEO has been Jan Arve Haugan.

Erik Tønseth became director-general of Kværner in 1989, and under his leadership the company underwent large-scale international expansion, acquiring the state-owned Govan Shipbuilders from British Shipbuilders. During 1992, Kværner acquired the Swedish company Götaverken. In 1996, Kværner acquired the British conglomerate Trafalgar House, after which it moved its international headquarters from Oslo to London. During January 1996, Kvaerner purchased a stake in the Vyborg Shipyard () and renamed it Kverner-Vyborg Shipyard () which was the largest manufacturer of offshore installations in Russia. Also during the mid 1990s, Kvaerner expanded its footprint in the Indonesian market, including through the formation of Kvaerner Bakrie Engineering in late 1995.

The company&#x27;s expansive acquisitions quickly brought economic hardship to the company. Kjell Almskog became Kværner&#x27;s CEO in 1998, and implemented various plans to streamline the company. This included the sale of the Cunard Line (a division of Trafalgar House) to Carnival Corporation, the sale of Kvaerner Govan to BAE Systems and the sale of Chemrec to Babcock Borsig. On 10 March 2000, Kvaerner sold the Vyborg Shipyard, which was losing money and faced closure during 1999, to the Sergey Zavyalov () associated with early 1990s established Ako Barss Group () which sold the shipyard to Rossiya Bank owners who placed the shipyard in the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) in 2012. In August 2000, Kværner sold its Construction Division to the Swedish company Skanska.

The economic slowdown in 2001 coupled with the firm&#x27;s heavy debt burden and a series of management missteps brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. Hugo Erikssen, a director of public relations at Yukos, and Oleg Sheiko (), Yukos&#x27; vice president for finance, and Alexey Golubovich (), who was Yukos&#x27; &quot;director of corporate finance&quot; until 2001, supported Kværner with mergers and financing.

During the early 2000s, Kværner was approached multiple times by its long time rival Aker ASA, a Norwegian oil services group controlled by Kjell Inge Røkke. During November 2001, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Kværner was compelled to merge with Aker. Røkke scuppered the solution preferred by Kværner&#x27;s management, which was a rescue by Yukos. Kværner&#x27;s international headquarters returned to Oslo and Kværner was restructured to become a holding company, with operating activities concentrated in Aker Kværner and Aker Yards. During 2005, Kværner ASA was merged with Aker Maritime Finance AS, a wholly owned company of Aker ASA, as a result of which the Kværner corporation ceased to exist.

During 2008, Aker Kvaerner changed its name to Aker Solutions ASA. In December 2010, Aker Solutions announced a decision to cultivate its core businesses; consequently, Kvaerner was established, through a demerger, as a specialised EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) company addressing the global market. On 6 May 2011, the shareholders&#x27; annual general meeting approved the establishment of Kvaerner as a separate company.

In 2015, it commenced fabrication of a 26,500 tonne steel jacket, the largest in Europe, for the Johan Sverdrup partnership. Subsequently, Kvarner was awarded additional work on this scheme.

In September 2019, the company announced their plans to target renewable growth and that it was looking to expand its operations in renewable energy to help boost this growth by around 40% in the coming years. One month later, it signed a contract valued at NOK 1.5 billion for Hywind Tampen, the world&#x27;s largest floating offshore wind farm. Separately, the company entered into a strategic collaboration with Nel ASA on green hydrogen projects, including the prospective development of large scale hydrogen production plants.

During July 2020, Aker Solutions announced major restructuring plans, centering on its merger with Kvaerner and the spinning off of its wind development and carbon capture and storage businesses into two separate Oslo-listed entities.

<text>Gaius Vibius Volusianus (Latin: &quot;Gaius Vibius Afinius Gallus Veldumnianus Volusianus&quot;; died August 253), commonly called Volusian, was a Roman emperor from 251 to 253, ruling with his father Trebonianus Gallus.

After Emperor Decius and his son and co-ruler Herennius Etruscus died in battle in June 251, Trebonianus Gallus was elected emperor in the field by the legion. Gallus raised Hostilian, the younger son of Decius, to &quot;augustus&quot; (co-emperor) and elevated Volusianus to &quot;caesar&quot;. After the death of Hostilian in July or August 251, Volusianus was raised to &quot;augustus&quot;. The short reign of Gallus and Volusianus was notable for the outbreak of a plague, which is said by some to be the reason for Hostilian&#x27;s death, and for hostilities with the Sasanian Empire and the Goths. Volusianus and his father were killed in August 253 by their own soldiers, who were terrified of the forces of the usurper Aemilian which were marching towards Rome.

==History==
Volusianus was the son of Trebonianus Gallus, who was named emperor in July 251 after his predecessors, Decius and Herennius Etruscus, died fighting the Goths at the Battle of Abritus. Elected by the troops in the field, Gallus signed a treaty, decried by contemporary historians as &quot;shameful&quot;, which promised tribute to the Goths if they abstained from raiding. He subsequently made a bid for popularity by declaring Hostilian, the surviving son of Decius, &quot;augustus&quot; (emperor) with him, voluntarily sharing his power with the prior imperial family. Later, still in July 251, Gallus elevated Volusianus to &quot;caesar&quot; (heir-apparent). Volusianus was wed to Hostilian&#x27;s sister, of an unknown name.

Hostilian died in July or August 251. The reason for his death is disputed: Aurelius Victor and the author of the &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot; both say that Hostilian died of a plague, but Zosimus claims that Trebonianus Gallus murdered the young &quot;augustus&quot; so that Volusianus could take his place. Regardless of circumstances, Volusianus subsequently received the rank of &quot;augustus&quot;. He was made consul in 252, alongside Trebonianus Gallus, and in 253, alongside Valerius Maximus. The same plague that killed Hostilian devastated the rest of Rome, although Trebonianus Gallus gained much popularity by ensuring that all of the plague victims were given proper burials, regardless of their social status. During the reign of Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus, the persecution of Christians was not as extreme as it was under Decius, although Pope Cornelius was exiled in 252AD. Novatian was also forced to flee Rome during this period of persecution. Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus issued only two imperial rescripts during their reign.

During the shared reign of Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus, the Roman Empire was invaded by both the Goths and the Sassanids. Both co-emperors chose to stay in Rome rather than confront the invasions themselves. The Sassanids attacked in 252, quickly overrunning Mesopotamia, and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Barbalissos, near Barbalissos in the province of Euphratensis (modern day Syria). They advanced into Roman territory as far as Antioch, which was captured in 253 after a prolonged siege. In 253, the Goths invaded Moesia Inferior, as the new governor, Aemilian, had refused to pay the tribute to them. The Goths split into two bands, with one raiding the cities of Moesia Inferior and Thracia, and the other crossing into Asia Minor as far as Ephesus.

Aemilian succeeded in repelling the Goths, slaughtering many and forcing the rest back across the Danube. The prestige of this victory was so great that Aemilian&#x27;s soldiers spontaneously declared him emperor, in opposition to Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus. When the news reached Rome, Gallus and Volusianus called for reinforcements from Valerian, the future emperor, who had been strengthening the empire&#x27;s defences on the Rhine. Aemilian marched to Italy at a rapid pace, arriving before Valerian could such send any assistance. The troops available to the co-emperors feared fighting the much stronger forces of Aemilian. To forestall the battle, they mutinied, killing Gallus and Volusianus at Interamna, in Umbria, in August 253. The &quot;Chronography of 354&quot; says the co-emperors ruled for a total of two years, four months, and nine days.

== Numismatics ==

The &quot;aurei&quot; of Volusianus fell into two types. There were five styles of coins which featured his bust on the obverse, with the reverse showing: Aequitas sitting, Aeternitas standing, Apollo standing, Juno sitting inside a rounded temple, or Victoria standing. There were a further six styles of coins which featured his bust with a Radiate on the obverse, with the reverse displaying: Concordia sitting, Felicitas standing, Libertas standing, Providence standing, Salus standing, or a helmeted Virtus standing. The coins of Volusianus occasionally bore the inscription &quot;Saeculum nouum&quot; (new age), alongside the traditional inscriptions &quot;Romae aeternae&quot; (eternal Rome) and &quot;Pax aeternae&quot; (eternal peace).

<doc id="791532" wikidata="Q2809463" url="?curid=791532" title="William Berkeley (governor)">
<text>Sir William Berkeley (; 16059 July 1677) was an English colonial administrator who served as the governor of Virginia from 1660 to 1677. One of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina, as governor of Virginia he implemented policies that bred dissent among the colonists and sparked Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. A favourite of King Charles I, the king first granted him the governorship in 1642. Berkeley was unseated following the execution of Charles I, but his governorship was restored by King Charles II in 1660. 

Charles II also named Berkeley one of the eight Lords Proprietors of Carolina, in recognition of his loyalty to the Stuarts during the English Civil War. As governor, Berkeley oversaw the implementation of a policy known as &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, which mandated that all babies born to enslaved parents take the legal status of their mother. As proprietor of Green Spring Plantation in James City County, he experimented with activities such as growing silkworms as part of his efforts to expand the tobacco-based economy. He was the author of &quot;Discourse and View of Virginia,&quot; where he argued for diversifying the colony&#x27;s tobacco economy.

==Early life==
Berkeley was born in 1605 in Bruton, Somersetshire to Maurice Berkeley (died 1617) and Elizabeth Killigrew, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family, both of whom held stock in the Virginia Company of London. Referred to as &quot;Will&quot; by his family and friends, he was born in the winter of 1605 into landed gentry. His father died when he was twelve and, though indebted, left Berkeley land in Somerset. His elder brother was John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton.

Young Berkeley showed signs of a quick wit and broad learning. His informal education consisted of observing his elders; from them he learned &quot;the moves that governed the larger English society and his privileged place in it&quot;. Also, as part of the English country gentry, he was aware of agricultural practices, knowledge which would influence his actions as governor of Virginia.

Though his father died in debt, Berkeley secured a proper education. He entered grammar school at about six or seven years old where he became literate in Latin and English. At eighteen, like the other Berkeley men, he entered Oxford. He began his studies at Queen&#x27;s College in the footsteps of his forebears, but quickly transferred to St. Edmund Hall, a &quot;throwback to medieval times&quot;. He received, though not necessarily completed, a B.A. in fifteen months of his arrival at the Hall.

All undergraduates at St. Edmund Hall received a personal tutor. While the identity of Berkeley&#x27;s tutor is unsure, his effect upon the boy showed through William&#x27;s &quot;disciplined intellect and steady appetite for knowledge&quot;.

In 1632, he gained a place in the household of Charles I. That position gave him entré into a court literary circle known as &quot;The Wits&quot;. Berkeley wrote several plays, one of which — &quot;The Lost Lady: A Tragy Comedy&quot; — was performed for Charles I and Henrietta Maria and was published in 1638. It is also included in the first and fourth editions of Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Old Plays&quot;, and &quot;A Description of Virginia&quot; (1663).

Soldiering in the First and Second Bishops&#x27; Wars (1639–1640) gained Berkeley a knighthood.

==First administration as governor==

Berkeley replaced Sir Francis Wyatt as governor of Virginia in 1641. He was governor of the colony of Virginia from 1641 to 1652 and from 1660 to 1677.

Berkeley&#x27;s main initiative when he first became governor was to encourage diversification of Virginia&#x27;s agricultural products. He accomplished this through passing laws and by setting himself up as an example for planters.

Arriving at Jamestown in 1642, Berkeley erected Green Spring House on a tract of land west of the capital, where he experimented with alternatives to tobacco. It was at Green Spring that he planted such diverse crops as corn, wheat, barley, rye, rape[seed], tobacco, oranges, lemons, grapes, sugar and silk. Berkeley devoted much of his time as a planter to experimenting with alternatives to tobacco; although he always produced the crop, he &quot;despised&quot; it. As a planter, with Virginia in mind, Berkeley constantly attempted to determine the best crops for the state through trial and error. Berkeley produced flax, fruits, potash, silk, and spirits which he exported through a commercial network that joined Green Spring to markets in North America, the West Indies, Great Britain, and Holland. Upon the recommendation of several of his slaves, Berkeley became a successful rice farmer. They were familiar with its cultivation from their native West Africa. He owned Boldrup Plantation.

==English Civil War and Commonwealth==
When the parliamentarians were successful, Berkeley offered an asylum in Virginia to gentlemen on the royalist side. After the king was beheaded he dispatched his secretary of state Richard Lee I to the Netherlands to secure an extension of his office from the Crown Prince. That document proved worthless because Parliament dispatched a small fleet to the colony, and the governor, unable to offer resistance, was ultimately forced to resign his authority. However, Lee negotiated terms such that Berkeley received permission to remain on his own plantation as a private person.

At the monarchy&#x27;s Restoration, Berkeley was reappointed governor.

==Second administration as governor==
For Berkeley, the path towards Virginia&#x27;s prosperity was fourfold: a diverse economy; free trade; a close-knit colonial society; and autonomy from London. He proceeded to turn this thought into action in various ways. In order to support a diversified economy and free trade, for instance, he used his own plantation as an example. Virginia&#x27;s autonomy from London was supported in the General Assembly&#x27;s role in the colony&#x27;s governance. The Assembly was, in effect, a &quot;miniature Parliament&quot;. The colony&#x27;s autonomy from London was also advocated by Berkeley in his efforts against the revival of the Virginia Company of London.

Berkeley was &quot;bitterly hostile&quot; to Virginia&#x27;s Puritans and Quakers. In an attempt to suppress them, Berkeley helped enact a law to &quot;preserve the Established Church&#x27;s [The Church of England] Unity and purity of doctrine&quot;. It punished any minister who preached outside the teachings and doctrine of this church, thus oppressing Puritans, Quakers, and any other religious minority.

Berkeley strongly opposed public education. Though he was unable to foresee the eventual establishment of such schools, he held that they would bring &quot;disobedience, heresy, and sects into the world,&quot; and were for such reasons destructive to society. He also held printing at the same level as public education.

===Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion and downfall===

Berkeley&#x27;s downfall came with the advent of his second term. He returned from retirement in 1660 due to the early death of Governor Samuel Mathews. At his return, Berkeley appealed to England for financial support of Virginia&#x27;s economy. Charles II denied Berkeley&#x27;s appeal &quot;in favour of free trade&quot;.

In 1675, Berkeley appointed Nathaniel Bacon, his wife&#x27;s nephew, to Virginian high office.

Slow to respond to Indian attacks, Berkeley was viewed as incompetent, making his authority easy to undermine. Disagreements over Indian policy led Bacon to rebel against Berkeley. Bacon accepted command of an illegal troop of Indian fighters and disregarded the governor&#x27;s warning against leading the volunteers. &quot;He declared Bacon a rebel, dissolved the General Assembly, and promised to remedy any complaints the voters had with him.&quot;

Bacon unexpectedly led 500 armed men into Jamestown and compelled the frightened legislators to appoint him general before he marched away in search of the Indians. His extortion of a general&#x27;s commission turned a dispute over Indian policy into a duel to the death over who would control Virginia: Bacon or Berkeley.

&quot;Berkeley defeated Bacon&#x27;s invaders, which enabled him to return to the western shore and to retake his capital. Once reports of the revolt reached London, the crown sent 1,000 redcoats, ships, and a commission to crush Bacon. There was nothing for the troops to do because Berkeley had regained the upper hand. The rebellion ended before they arrived in January 1677. The Treaty of 1677, the formal peace treaty between the Indians and the colonists, was signed on 29 May 1677, after Berkeley returned to England.&quot;

==Death==
Berkeley died in Berkeley House, Mayfair, England, on 9 July 1677, and he was &quot;buried half a world away from the place that had become his home&quot; in the crypt of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Twickenham, where there is a memorial window to him and his brother, Lord Berkeley.

<doc id="791543" wikidata="Q34494" url="?curid=791543" title="Flag of Victoria (state)">
<text>The state flag of Victoria is a British Blue Ensign defaced by the state badge of Victoria in the fly. The badge is the Southern Cross surmounted by an imperial crown, which is currently the St Edward&#x27;s Crown. The stars of the Southern Cross are white and range from five to eight points with each star having one point pointing to the top of the flag. The flag dates from 1870, with minor variations, the last of which was in 1901. It is the only Australian state flag not to feature the state badge on a round disc.

==History==
===1844 separation flag===
In 1844, John Harrison, the father of H. C. A. Harrison, designed a flag for the Separation Society, an organisation advocating for the separation of the Port Phillip District (present-day Victoria) from the Colony of New South Wales. The flag, featuring &quot;a white star centred on a crimson ground&quot;, was flown at a large open-air meeting on Batman&#x27;s Hill in June 1844. It was described more fully in the &quot;Port Phillip Gazette&quot;:

Harrison flew the flag again in 1851 at a meeting of miners on the goldfields at Bendigo.

===Previous official flags===
The first flag of Victoria was adopted in 1870 and was first flown from HMVS &quot;Nelson&quot; on 9 February 1870. It too was a defaced British Blue Ensign with the Southern Cross located in the fly. The stars of the Southern Cross were white and had 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 points with only the leftmost and rightmost stars having one point pointing to the top of the flag. The adoption of the flag came about when Victoria became the first Australian colony to acquire a warship, and thus under the British Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865 Victoria needed a flag to distinguish its ships from other British ships. At the same time, the red ensign was incorrectly authorised for use by civil vessels registered in the colony of Victoria. Despite the invalid authorisation, the flag continued to be used, and was flown alongside the Union flag during federation celebrations in 1901. The red ensign did not track changes to the blue ensign, and so no crown was added, nor did the stars rotate to point upwards facing the flag.

Victoria then adopted the current flag in 1877 with the stars of the southern cross from then on having 5, 6, 7, 7 and 8 points. In 1901, the lieutenant-governor advised the secretary of state that henceforth a St Edward&#x27;s Crown would be used on the now state flag.

== Construction ==
Unlike the national flag, the flag of Victoria is not defined by legislation (either state or federal). As a result, there are no official legal requirements for the construction of the flag of Victoria. However, traditionally the flag has the following elements:

# the Union Jack occupies the upper quarter next the staff;
# the fly is wholly blue, in line with the British Blue Ensign;
# the State Badge is situated with its centre halfway between the edge of the canton and the end of the fly, and to occupy the majority of thereof;

<text>The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates.

Normally, carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is important in fueling brain function. However, if only a little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies, the latter passing into the brain and replacing glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood (a state called ketosis) eventually lowers the frequency of epileptic seizures. Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists after discontinuing the diet. Some evidence shows that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. Side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones.

The original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ketogenic ratio or ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.

In 1994, Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams, whose son&#x27;s severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot; program and &quot;...First Do No Harm&quot; (1997), a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.

Possible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, headache, neurotrauma, pain, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and sleep disorders.

==Epilepsy==
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders after migraine and stroke, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to a specific part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and the ketogenic diet.

==History==
The ketogenic diet is a mainstream medical dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and &#x27;30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 25–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.

===Fasting===
Physicians of ancient Greece treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients&#x27; diet. An early treatise in the Hippocratic Corpus, &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot;, covers the disease; it dates from . Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis. In the same collection, the author of &quot;Epidemics&quot; describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink. The royal physician Erasistratus declared, &quot;One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.&quot; Galen believed an &quot;attenuating diet&quot; might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.

The first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911. Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were &quot;detoxified&quot; by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients&#x27; mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, potassium bromide, which dulled the mind.

Around this time, Bernarr Macfadden, an American exponent of physical culture, popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the osteopathic physician Dr. Hugh William Conklin of Battle Creek, Michigan, began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the Peyer&#x27;s patches in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25 days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his &quot;water diet&quot; and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin&#x27;s case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.

Conklin&#x27;s fasting therapy was adopted by neurologists in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the &quot;New York Medical Journal&quot; claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent endocrinologist Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the American Medical Association convention. He had seen Conklin&#x27;s success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. Charles P. Howland, the parent of one of Conklin&#x27;s successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study &quot;the ketosis of starvation&quot;. As professor of paediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist Stanley Cobb and his assistant William G. Lennox.

===Diet===
In 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.

Wilder&#x27;s colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15 g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman&#x27;s work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.

===Anticonvulsants and decline===
During the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt Jr. and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time, restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.

===MCT diet===

In the 1960s, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.

===Revival===
The ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot; television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams. The two-year-old had epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to John M. Freeman at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie&#x27;s epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research. A multicentre prospective study began in 1994; the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV drama film, &quot;...First Do No Harm&quot;, starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy&#x27;s intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.

By 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.

==Efficacy==
The ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. Adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet, though compliance with oral diet (vs tube fed) remains a problem.

===Trial design===
Early studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (a retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).

Another difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet&#x27;s restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.

===Outcomes===
A study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free. At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.

It is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.

A Cochrane systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures. Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.

A systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, and the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of low-density lipoprotein, high total cholesterol, and weight loss.

==Indications and contraindications==

The ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England, and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. The two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—are more appropriate for adolescents and adults, mainly due to better adherence. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and others who are tube-fed.

Advocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet is recommended earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis complex and for children fed by gastrostomy tube.

A survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.

Because the ketogenic diet alters the body&#x27;s metabolism, it is a first-line therapy in children with certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in the treatment of other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria, and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.

==Interactions==
The ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient&#x27;s existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.

==Adverse effects==
The ketogenic diet is not considered a benign, holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis, and hypoglycaemia if an initial fast is undertaken. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.

Long-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and kidney stones. The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Around half of clinics give oral potassium citrate supplements empirically to all ketogenic diet patients, with some evidence that this reduces the incidence of stone formation. However, this has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:
* Excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.
* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.
* The urine has a low pH, which stops uric acid from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a for calcium stone formation.
* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs; this practice is no longer encouraged.

In adolescents and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, dyslipidemia, and in women, dysmenorrhea.

==Implementation==
The ketogenic diet is a medical nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.

Implementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.

===Initiation===
The Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the classic ketogenic diet has been widely adopted. It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission. Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.

At the initial consultation, patients are screened for conditions that may contraindicate the diet. A dietary history is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.

The day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal. On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids are allowed until dinner, which consists of &quot;eggnog&quot; restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the &quot;eggnog&quot; dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal&#x27;s caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not &quot;eggnog&quot;). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient&#x27;s current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.

When in the hospital, glucose levels are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic ketosis (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.

Variations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using outpatient clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of acidosis, hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.

For patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.

===Maintenance===
After initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).

A short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if ketone levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight. Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even &quot;sugar-free&quot; food can contain carbohydrates such as maltodextrin, sorbitol, starch, and fructose. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.

===Discontinuation===
About 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.

Children who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.

==Variants==

===Classic===
The ketogenic diet is calculated by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child&#x27;s age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle spasticity require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18 months, older than 12 years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9 kcal/g (38 kJ/g) compared to 4 kcal/g (17 kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1 g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.

A computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1 g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.

The classic ketogenic diet is not a balanced diet and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, fortified cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the B vitamins, calcium, and vitamin D must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient&#x27;s age: a multivitamin with minerals and calcium with vitamin D. A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500 kcal (6,300 kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:
===MCT oil===
Normal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.

===Modified Atkins===
First reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10 g per day in children or 20 g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30 g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.

The modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients. While the strength of evidence is low for the modified Atkins, it has been known to show seizure freedom in some infants. Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term. Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.

===Low glycemic index treatment===
The low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) is an attempt to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60 g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.

Short-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre&#x27;s experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.

===Prescribed formulations===

Infants and patients fed via a gastrostomy tube can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.

===Worldwide===
In theory, there are no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child&#x27;s meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.

In Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: for instance, Hindus consider cows sacred animals not to be killed and eaten, Islam forbids consumption of pork, and strict vegetarians of the Jain faith do not eat root vegetables. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.

In many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit, and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.

==Mechanism of action==

===Seizure pathology===

The brain is composed of a network of neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.

The nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through channels in the neuron&#x27;s cell membrane followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the refractory period), which is mediated by another potassium channel. The flow through these ion channels is governed by a &quot;gate&quot; which is opened by either a voltage change or a chemical messenger known as a ligand (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.

There are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.

===Seizure control===
Although many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.

On the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell&#x27;s mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this by using fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies, namely β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and &quot;partially&quot; substitute for blood glucose as a source of energy.

The ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in animal models, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.

The ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant. Conversely, fenofibrate, not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental anticonvulsant properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet. This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.

Anticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.

==Other medical applications==
The ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism, headache, neurotrauma, pain, Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) and sleep disorders. As of 2022 there is no clinical evidence that a ketogenic diet is effective to treat cancer.

<doc id="791549" wikidata="Q132681711" url="?curid=791549" title="Amos, Quebec">
<text>Amos is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, on the Harricana River. It is the seat of Abitibi Regional County Municipality.

Amos is the main town on the Harricana River, and the smallest of the three primary towns — after Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d&#x27;Or — in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec. The smaller communities of Lac-Gauvin and Saint-Maurice-de-Dalquier are also within the municipal boundaries of Amos.

==History==

Rupert&#x27;s Land, in which Abitibi was located, was owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and was bought by Canada in 1869. Abitibi itself was then annexed to the province in Quebec on June 13, 1898, by an act of the federal Parliament.

Amos was the starting point for the colonization of the region of Abitibi that began in 1910. The municipality was established in 1914 while the city itself was chartered in 1925. The name of the city came from the maiden name of the wife of Sir Lomer Gouin, then premier of Quebec.

A related municipality was created in 1917 under the name &#x27;Municipalité de la partie ouest des cantons unis de Figuery et Dalquier&#x27; (Municipality of the western part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier) which changed its name to Amos-Ouest in 1949. In 1974 the municipality fused with the city of Amos proper. Another related municipality was created in 1918 under the name &#x27;Municipalité de la partie est des cantons Figuery et Dalquier&#x27; (Municipality of the eastern part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier), which also changed its name later 1950 to Amos-Est. The municipality was finally integrated into the city of Amos itself in 1987. In 2025, The municipality of Saint-Félix-de-Dalquier was annexed into Amos.

(The pegmatite is about 1% lithium carbonate.) The mine is about north of Val-d&#x27;Or, southeast of Amos, and km west of Barraute. It is in the northeast corner of La Corne Township. Access to the mine is via paved road from Val d&#x27;Or.

<text>Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture was the largest of the 14 prefectures of Chad between 1960 and 1999. It was transformed into Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, one of the 18 regions into which the country has been divided since 2002. Its name is often abbreviated to BET.

Located in the north of Chad it was adjacent to Algeria, while also bordering Niger and Sudan. Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti covered an area of 600,350 km, almost half of Chad&#x27;s total area. It had a population of 73,185 (as of 1993), partly nomadic and also scattered small towns and other settlements. Its capital was Faya-Largeau.

==Geography==
Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti is located in the Sahara Desert and extends into the Sahel. Its diverse topography ranges from the volcanic Tibesti Mountains to the Bodélé Depression, a vast Holocene lake-bed that is one of the Earth&#x27;s strongest dust storm producing regions. Overall, the territory is extremely arid.

<doc id="791595" wikidata="Q3127494" url="?curid=791595" title="Harlon Block">
<text>Harlon Henry Block (November 6, 1924 – March 1, 1945) was a United States Marine Corps corporal who was killed in action during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.

Born in Yorktown, Texas, Block joined the Marine Corps with seven high school classmates in February 1943. He subsequently became a Paramarine and participated in combat on Bougainville. After the Paramarines were disbanded in 1944, he was one of the Marines who raised the second U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; by photographer Joe Rosenthal.

The first flag raised over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was deemed too small. Later that day, Block, a rifleman in the 5th Marine Division, was ordered up the mountain with three Marines to raise a larger flag. The second flag-raising photograph was an AP wirephoto that was widely reproduced and became famous. The second flag raising was also filmed in color.

Block was not recognized as one of the second flag-raisers until the Marine Corps announced in January 1947 (after an investigation) that he was in the photograph and Sergeant Henry Hansen was not. Block is one of three Marines in the photograph who were not originally identified as flag raisers.

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, was modeled after Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of six Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima.

== Early life ==
Block was born in Yorktown, Texas, the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block (1896–1968) and Ada Belle Brantley (1896–1980), a Seventh day-Adventist family. The Block children were: Edward Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford. Edward Frederick Block was a World War I veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer. In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to Weslaco, Texas, a city located in the Rio Grande Valley. His father became a dairy farmer, and the children attended a Seventh-day Adventist private school. Harlon Block was expelled in his freshman year when he refused to tell the principal which student had vandalized the school. Block then transferred to Weslaco High School and was remembered as an outgoing student with many friends. A natural athlete, Block led the Weslaco Panther Football Team to the Conference Championship. He was honored as &quot;All South Texas End&quot;. Block and seven of his high school friends decided on joining the Marine Corps before they graduated and the school held a special early graduation ceremony for them in January 1943.

== U.S. Marine Corps ==
=== World War II ===
Block and seven of his high school football teammates enlisted in the Marine Corps on February 18, 1943, through the Selective Service System at San Antonio. They were sent to recruit training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego. On April 14, Private Block began parachute training at the Marine Parachute Training School in San Diego, and on May 22, he qualified as a Paramarine and was promoted to private first class. In November, he was sent to the Pacific Theater arriving at New Caledonia on November 15. On November 24, he was assigned to Headquarters and Service Company, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment, I Marine Amphibious Corps. On December 21, he landed on Bougainville. On December 22, he was assigned to Headquarters Company, 3rd Parachute Battalion, I Marine Amphibious Corps. On February 14, 1944, Pfc. Block returned to San Diego with his unit. On February 29, the parachutists were disbanded. On March 1, Pfc. Block was assigned to Second Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. In September, he was sent to Hawaii with his unit after extensive training, and began more training and preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima. He was promoted to corporal on October 27.

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====
On February 19, 1945, Cpl. Block landed on Iwo Jima from the after transferring off the . His rifle company was part of the 28th Marines amphibious assault landing at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. The 28th Marines mission was to capture Mount Suribachi.

===== First flag-raising =====

On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company&#x27;s executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, to take a platoon-size patrol up 556-foot-high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion&#x27;s flag to signal the summit was secure. Captain Dave Severance, E Company&#x27;s commander, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion. The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30 a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top of the volcano with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg at about 10:30 a.m. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the south end beaches of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beach. Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt. Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and Navy corpsman John Bradley pitched in to help make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant Louis R. Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

===== Second flag-raising =====

Lt. Col. Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken up the mountain after he determined that the battalion&#x27;s flag was too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered Sgt. Michael Strank, a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley to go with him up the volcano with communication wire (or supplies). Pfc. Rene Gagnon, the company&#x27;s runner (messenger), was ordered to take &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; batteries and the second flag up the mountain and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant for safekeeping down below.

When all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise it. At approximately 1 p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the first flagstaff. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Harold Schultz, and Pfc. Harold Keller. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were members of Lt. Schrier&#x27;s patrol. Afterwards, rocks were added at the bottom of the flagstaff which was then stabilized by three guy-ropes. The second raising was immortalized forever by the black and white photo of the flag raising by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press. This flag-raising was also filmed in color by Sergeant Bill Genaust. Marine historians, with the aid of the FBI&#x27;s Digital Evidence Laboratory, also confirmed that Cpl. Block is the 18th man in Rosenthal&#x27;s well-known &quot;Gung Ho&quot; photo. Although Block&#x27;s face is not visible, the top of his head (hairline and forehead) is seen directly behind Sgt. Hansen (who wears a soft cap).

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the 3rd Marine Division troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on Iwo Jima on March 2 and Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4. Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1 and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.

==== Death ====
According to the book &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; by James Bradley (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley), when Sgt. Strank was killed on March 1, Cpl. Block assumed command of Strank&#x27;s squad in E Company&#x27;s Second Platoon and, later the same day, Cpl. Block was mortally wounded by an enemy mortar round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Cpl. Block&#x27;s last words were &quot;They killed me!&quot; However, Ralph Griffiths, a member of the same platoon as Cpl. Block, claimed that Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed instantly by the same shell which wounded him on March 1. Cpl. Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima on March 5, 1945. A service was held there on March 26 with Pfc. Hayes and other members of E Company in attendance. In January 1949, Cpl. Block&#x27;s remains were re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the Marine Military Academy near its Iwo Jima monument in Harlingen, Texas.

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==
The Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. Sculptor Felix de Weldon was inspired to make the memorial after seeing Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of the second flag raising. De Weldon sculptured the flag raisers&#x27; images and positions on the memorial from the photograph. Due to the incorrect identification of the first flag raiser positioned at the bottom of the flagstaff as Sgt. Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Hansen in 1945 (Hansen helped raise the first flag), Hansen was depicted as the first 32-foot (9.8-meter) bronze statue at the base of the flagstaff on the monument until the Marine Corps announced in January 1947 that Cpl. Block was actually the flag raiser in the photograph. The Memorial was turned over to the National Park Service in 1955.

During the dedication, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Orme Lewis, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Ira Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers depicted on the monument was also seated upfront alongside John Bradley (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until June 2016), Rene Gagnon (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until October 2019), Mrs. Ada Belle Block, Mrs. Martha Strank, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day; Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation; General Shepherd, who presented the memorial to the American people; Felix de Weldon, sculptor; and Richard Nixon, who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

== Second flag-raiser corrections ==
On March 20, 1945, President Roosevelt ordered the flag-raisers in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph to Washington D.C. after the battle. Pfc. Gagnon was ordered to Washington on April 3 and arrived on April 7. He was questioned the same day by a Marine public information officer about all the identities of the flag raisers in the photograph. He identified the six flag raisers as Sgt. Strank, Pfc. Sousley, Navy corpsman John Bradley, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Sgt. Henry Hansen, and himself. He also said Sgt. Strank, Sgt. Hansen, and Pfc. Sousley were killed on Iwo Jima. After Pfc. Gagnon was questioned, Pfc. Hayes and PhM2c. Bradley were ordered to Washington. Bradley, who was recovering from his wounds at Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California, was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Maryland, where he was shown Rosenthal&#x27;s flag-raising photograph and was told he was in it. Both Bradley (on crutches) and Hayes arrived in Washington on April 19. They reported to the same officer and were questioned separately. PhM2c. Bradley agreed with all of the identities of the flag-raisers named by Pfc. Gagnon in the photograph including his own. Pfc. Hayes agreed with all of the identities named by Pfc. Gagnon except Sgt. Hansen, who he said was Cpl. Block at the base of the flagstaff. The Marine lieutenant colonel told Pfc. Hayes that the identities were made public on April 8 and would not be changed, and to not say anything about it anymore (the officer later denied that Pfc. Hayes ever told him that Cpl. Block was in the photograph).

A Marine Corps investigation of the identities of the six second flag-raisers began in December 1946 and concluded in January 1947 that it was Cpl. Block and not Sgt. Hansen at the base of the flagstaff in the Rosenthal photograph, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter. The identities of the other five second flag-raisers were confirmed.

The Marine Corps review board looked once more into the identities of the six second flag-raisers in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph, this time concluding in June 2016 that Harold Schultz was in the photograph and John Bradley was not. Franklin Sousley, not Schultz, is now in the position initially ascribed to Bradley (fourth from left) in the photograph and Schultz is now in Sousley&#x27;s former position (second from left) in the photograph. The identities of the other five flag-raisers were confirmed. Schultz did not ever say publicly that he was a flag-raiser or in the photograph.

A third Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers concluded in October 2019, that Harold Keller was in the Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph in place of Rene Gagnon (fifth from left). Gagnon who carried the larger second flag up Mount Suribachi, helped lower the first flagstaff and removed the first flag at the time the second flag was raised. The identities of the other five flag raisers were confirmed. Like Schultz, Keller did not ever say publicly he was a flag-raiser or that he was in the photograph.

<text>Salamat was one of the 14 prefectures of Chad. Located in the southeast of the country, Salamat covered an area of 63,000 square kilometers and had a population of 184,403 in 1993. Its capital was Am Timan.

Salamat&#x27;s population was a mix of both Muslim and non-Muslim peoples.

In the late 1960s, a highly regarded wildlife reserve was destroyed by Chadian rebels, although many native wildlife specimens survived, including elephants and giraffes. The area included some of the only water sources that remained available through the ten-month dry season.

<doc id="791624" wikidata="Q1064042" url="?curid=791624" title="Flag of New South Wales">
<text>The current state flag of New South Wales was officially adopted in 1876. The flag is based on the defaced British Blue Ensign with the state badge located in the fly. The badge, based on the coat of arms, is a white disc with the cross of St George, a golden lion passant guardant in the centre of the cross and an eight-pointed gold star on each arm of the cross.
== Symbolism ==
As a variant of the Blue Ensign, the Union Jack is displayed in the canton. The St George&#x27;s Cross, the Southern Cross and the &#x27;Lion in the South&#x27; are displayed in the Badge of New South Wales on the flag. The St George&#x27;s Cross is used on the ensign of the British Royal Navy, with a golden, 8-pointed star placed on each arm of the cross. This symbolises the maritime origins of New South Wales, with seafarers relying upon the Southern Cross to navigate the seas, and the role of the navy in protecting the State.

The &#x27;Lion in the South&#x27; is taken from the three golden lions on a red field on the arms of England, and symbolises both the sovereignty of New South Wales and the offspring of an old country. It represent the origins of the founders of the Colony of New South Wales as well as the independence of their succeeding generations.

== History ==
The first flag of New South Wales was adopted in 1867. It too was a defaced British Blue Ensign with the letters &quot;NSW&quot; in white located in the fly. The flag was a response to the passing of the British Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865 which allowed any British colony its own warships and variant of the Blue Ensign.

New South Wales then adopted a second flag in 1870 and it was almost identical to that of Victoria (with gold stars; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 points). This flag was also a defaced British Blue Ensign with the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Badge&quot; located in the fly. The badge was the Southern Cross and an imperial crown situated above the Southern Cross. The difference between this flag and that of the Victorian flag was that the stars were gold and ranged from five to nine points with each star having one point pointing to the bottom of the flag.

The present flag was adopted due to criticisms from the British Admiralty that the previous design was too similar to the design of the Victorian flag.

The state badge was designed by the Colonial Architect James Barnet and Captain Francis Hixson, a retired Royal Navy officer.

=== Redesign proposal ===
In the mid-1990s, a series of proposals to redesign the New South Wales state flag emerged, gaining significant public attention in the lead-up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The initiative, originally promoted by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in November 1996, aimed to address the perceived disconnect between the existing flag and the state&#x27;s identity. The &quot;Herald&quot; argued that the flag designed served &quot;a British rather than a NSW purpose&quot; and failed to resonate with modern New South Wales&#x27; cultural identity and heritage.

In November 1996, two alternative flag designs were unveiled and displayed prominently to gauge public interest. One was inspired by the design of the Canadian flag, whilst the other included a Southern Cross. Both designs incorporated the Waratah.

Advocates of the redesign included former premiers, political leaders from both the Liberal and Labor parties, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, and notable sports figures. Supporters argued that a new flag would better reflect the state&#x27;s evolving cultural and social identity, particularly as Sydney prepared to host the Olympics—a global showcase of the state&#x27;s heritage.

However, the proposals also faced criticism. Traditionalists expressed concern that altering the flag might undermine historical continuity, while others feared it signaled an imminent move towards republicanism. A 1996 &quot;Herald AGB-McNair&quot; poll revealed that only 12% of New South Wales residents could accurately describe the existing flag, highlighting a potential lack of public attachment to its symbols.

In response to the debate, proponents suggested introducing legislation to authorize a public referendum on the flag redesign, potentially aligning the vote with the 1999 state election. This timeline would allow for extensive public discussion before a new flag could be adopted ahead of the 2000 Olympics. Despite the momentum, the proposal ultimately did not progress beyond the discussion phase.

<text>Abéché (, &quot;Absha&quot;) is a city in Chad and the capital of the Ouaddaï Region. It is one of the largest cities in the country and has within it the remnants of the ancient capital, including palaces, mosques, and the tombs of former sultans.

==History==
The city of Abéché was made capital of the Wadai Sultanate in the 1890s, after the wells at Ouara, the former capital, had dried out. In 1909, French troops invaded the Kingdom and established a garrison in Abéché. France took power, forcing the sultan to renounce his throne. At that time, Abéché was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, but major epidemics reduced the population to 6,000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restored by orders of the French government, and Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king. Once one of the strongholds of the Arabic slave trade route, the city is known today for its markets, mosques, church, square (the Place de l&#x27;Indépendance) and for its sultan&#x27;s palace. Abéché has several schools, a hospital, a university and is one of the major garrisons of the Armee Nationale du Tchad ANT . There is a small airport , Airport ID: AE, operated sunrise to sunset (SR-SS) with flights to N&#x27;Djaména.

On 25 November 2006, the city was taken by the Union of Forces for Democracy, a rebel group that sought to depose president Idriss Déby. Extensive looting took place during the night. On the same day, nearby Biltine was captured by the Rally of Democratic Forces, another rebel group. A day later, both cities were retaken by the Chadian army.

On 30 October 2007, the city came to international attention when 17 French volunteers working for the charity Zoé&#x27;s Ark were arrested there for alleged child abduction.

Abeche is the centrum for the delivery of humanitarian assistance for approx. 240,000 Darfurian refugees living in 12 camps east of the town, near the border with Sudan. A number of organizations opened office 2003 and 2004, e.g. UNHCR, the Red Cross, the German GTZ and UNICEF.

<text>Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand or MRTA () is a state enterprise under the Ministry of Transport of Thailand. It is responsible for the operation of rapid transit systems in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and including other provinces as defined by the royal decree. The MRTA was founded in 1992 and underwent restructuring in 2000. The MRTA currently oversees the operation of the MRT, which consists of the operational Blue Line, Purple Line, Yellow Line, and Pink Line. Other systems, including the Airport Rail Link, are owned and operated by other agencies.

== History ==
The Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand was established in 1992 under the name Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority, under the Royal Decree Establishment of the Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority B.E. 2535, with the objective of organizing mass transportation systems in Bangkok and its vicinity by electric train.

On 1 December 2000, under the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand Act B.E. 2543, the name was changed to Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand. 

Under the act, the MRTA has the authority to designate &quot;safe zones&quot; to protect subway tunnels and underground structures and oversee the metro system as a whole. In addition, the MRTA is able to find income other than passenger fares and can develop real estate as necessary for the benefit of the electric train service and has the authority to operate the electric train business. The transit system may expand to other provinces as the royal decree authorizes.

<text>Am Timan (Arabic: أم تيمان, &quot;ʾUmm Tīmān&quot;) is a city in Chad and is the capital of the region of Salamat. Most of economy comes from Salamat region such as fish, vegetables and anomalies meat, etc. In Arabic, Am Timan means &quot;mother of twins&quot;. As the capital of the prefecture, it has the area of many towns and villages around it, including the Zakouma National Park. The city has no university but there are schools and colleges, and a clinic, and hosts a large market day and holiday celebrations.

During the conflict period, a cotton plantation and processing plant just outside the city were destroyed. The city&#x27;s sand airport was upgraded by the French Foreign Legion in 1971 to allow military air transports to supply the anti-rebel effort. At the time, the only practical way in or out of the city was by air.

Since the dry season lasts for about seven months of the year, water becomes a problem as the dry season progresses. Aquifers are accessed by digging deeper and deeper into the bed of the Bahr Salamat (river). The river starts flowing with the onset of rain, however, and the children enjoy swimming in it.

==History==
===October 2006===
On 23 October 2006, the city was claimed to be captured by Union of Forces for Democracy, the main Chadian rebel group. The government of Chad disputed this claim.

In 2018, a lay first responder (LFR) program was launched to provide prehospital emergency medical services for residents.

<doc id="791642" wikidata="Q7269070" url="?curid=791642" title="Quantum meruit">
<text> is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;what one has earned&quot;. In the context of contract law, it means something along the lines of &quot;reasonable value of services&quot;.

In the United States, the elements of &quot;quantum meruit&quot; are determined by state common law. For example, to state a claim for unjust enrichment in New York, a plaintiff must allege that (1) defendant was enriched; (2) the enrichment was at plaintiff&#x27;s expense; and (3) the circumstances were such that equity and good conscience require defendants to make restitution.

==Situations==
&quot;Quantum meruit&quot; is the measure of damages where an express contract is mutually modified by the implied agreement of the parties, or not completed. While there is often confusion between the concept of &quot;quantum meruit&quot; and that of &quot;unjust enrichment&quot; of one party at the expense of another, the two concepts are distinct.

The concept of &quot;quantum meruit&quot; applies in (but is not limited to) the following set of situations:

#When a person hires another to do work, but an impeding act falling short of vitiating frustration/repudiation has occurred, such as access or intervening act of God, the worker may sue (or counter-sue) for the value of the improvements made/services rendered. The law implies a promise from the employer to the worker that they will pay them for their services, as much as they may deserve or merit.The measure of value set forth in a contract is legally admissible as evidence of the value of the improvements or services but the court (or thus out of court settlement) is &quot;not&quot; required to use the contract&#x27;s terms when calculating a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; award. (This is because the values set forth in the contract are rebuttable, meaning the one who ultimately may have to pay the award can contest the value of services set in the contract.)
#When there is an express contract for a stipulated amount and mode of compensation for services, the plaintiff cannot abandon the contract and resort to an action for a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; on an implied assumpsit. However, if there is absence of any promised consideration, the plaintiff (such as hirer) has a right to elect to repudiate the contract and, failing a valid frustration, innocent mistake reason or similar defense, has the right to compensation from the defendant on a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; basis.

==Examples==

I. An example used in United States law schools is usually the case of &quot;Steven v Bromley &amp; Son&quot; [1919].
*Facts
*#Shipowners agreed a charter fee for the transportation of steel billets
*#The charterers loaded general merchandise, in breach of the agreement
*Issue
:Could the ship owners be entitled to nominal damages only; or could a contract be inferred at a higher rate
*Decision
:Claim for beyond nominal damages allowed
*Reasoning
:A contract could be inferred such that the shipowners were entitled to the general rate for the ‘breaching’ cargo loaded.

II. Person A (plaintiff in this hypothetical) tells neighbor B (defendant) that he is going to build a wall on their property that will give a benefit to both A and B; A implies that it would be cheaper for both of them if A performs the labor instead of hiring a professional. B agrees that the wall should be built, but no price is negotiated. A builds the wall, and then asks B to compensate him for the benefit of the wall that he conferred on B (usually half the value of the wall). B refuses. A is entitled to some compensation based on &quot;quantum meruit&quot;. This is because there was an implied promise between A and B, which is derived from contract law, because A was acting under the assumption that B would pay for part of his services (see Estoppel). The winning of the case, or damages that would be agreed in any out of court settlement, will be directed as an assumpsit on a &quot;quantum meruit&quot;. &quot;Day v. Caton&quot;, 119 Mass. 513 (1876).

:In Canada, &quot;quantum meruit&quot; is not based on contract law but rather depends on equitable principles of unjust enrichment. Canadian law generally upholds the old maxim that estoppel allows an implied promise to act as a shield against litigation but never a sword. Therefore an implied promise would not create a cause of action. Instead &quot;quantum meruit&quot; is based on the need to prevent the neighbor from unjustly enriching himself by allowing the fence builder to proceed with the work based on an assumption that he would be compensated.

III. &quot;Quantum meruit&quot; can also apply where there is a breached contract.

:A contractor is contracted to work on a school. He does some work but then quits (breach of contract). He is entitled to be paid for the services he has already provided for the school on the basis of &quot;quantum meruit&quot; (however the school may be entitled to damages if it can prove the balance of the works will at market rates cost more than the balance if performed by the earlier contractor; and in some jurisdictions inconvenience/loss of amenity damages especially where time is stated to be of the essence).

IV. If a contractor finds part of their work replaced by others through no fault of their own, they seek damages for the amount(s) that the defendant benefited. Third parties, absent provisions preventing, such as new contractors finding the work more complex as a result of defects may, just as with all equitable actions, like a quantum meruit-basis restitution, promptly to avoid the doctrine of laches (equity) (having let matters lie) bring action against that contractor.

V. A promoter enters into a long-term service contract with a theatre to help book and organise shows for no one else for a few months. They take part-paid bookings for shows over these months but pass on none of that as agreed as they have grounds to allege the theatre is unsafe and the theatre need to make it safe. The theatre performs no repairs. Instead, the theatre terminates the contract before the benefit of the shows. After this the theatre runs most of the shows and gains benefit but does not pay the promoter. Some shows the theatre cancels without cause. A court would decide, following similar precedent, that the promoter is entitled to an assumpsit on a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; if the promoter has acted in a proportionate way as trustee (depository), delaying forwarding of the principal of the ticket sale part-payments, for sufficiently well-founded premises defects which could have affected its reputation.

==Notable cases==
===UK cases===
*&quot;Sumpter v Hedges&quot; [1898] 1 QB 673
*&quot;Way v Latilla&quot; [1937] 3 All ER 759: Way was entitled to remuneration on a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; basis; the value of the award was to be fixed by reference to the approach to remuneration adopted by the parties.
*&quot;ERDC Group Ltd. v. Brunel University&quot;, [2006] EWHC 687 (TCC) (29 March 2006): a construction company and its design sub-contractor had commenced work under a series of letters of intent issued in advance of a proposed appointment under JCT Terms of Contract. When the contract was offered for signature the construction company declined to sign unless work already done was paid for on a &quot;quantum meruit&quot; basis. The High Court ruled that whilst there were agreed letters of intent in place, their terms should govern the rates payable, but after 1 September 2002, when the final letter of intent expired, &quot;quantum meruit&quot; should apply, with rates and prices in line with the earlier stages of the work, adjusted to reflect an element of sub-standard work and delay in completion.
*&quot;Benedetti v Sawiris&quot;, [2013] UKSC 50 (17 July 2013), takes into account the ruling in &quot;Way v Latilla&quot; above.

===US cases===
*&quot;Chodos v. West Publishing Co.&quot;, 292 F.3d 992 (9th Circuit, 2002)
*&quot;Universal Acupuncture Pain Servs. v. Quadrino &amp; Schwartz, P.C.&quot;, 370 F.3d 259 (2nd Circuit, 2004)

<text>James Joseph &quot;Jimmy&quot; Ling (December 31, 1922 – December 17, 2004) was an American businessman and former head of Ling-Temco-Vought corporation. While at its helm, Ling used LTV funds to purchase a large number of corporations, and was one of the more famous of the 1960s conglomerate managers.

==Biography==
Ling was the son of a Catholic convert who later entered a Carmelite monastery. Ling&#x27;s mother died when he was young, and he lived for a time with an aunt in Shreveport, Louisiana. He failed to graduate from a Jesuit high school but became a master electrician after training at a US Navy school in Mississippi.

In 1947 he founded his own Dallas electrical contracting business, Ling Electric Company, where he lived in the rear of the shop. After incorporating and taking his company public in 1955, Ling found innovative ways to market his stock, including door-to-door soliciting and selling from a booth at the State Fair of Texas.

In 1956 Ling bought L.M. Electronics, followed by Altec Electronics in 1959 and Temco Aircraft in 1960. In 1961, he bought Chance Vought Aircraft, merging his interests into Ling-Temco-Vought. His empire fell apart after he acquired the money-losing Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company in 1970. He had to sell subsidiaries to try to stanch the ensuing financial hemorrhage.

After antitrust issues arose, bankers forced Ling&#x27;s resignation later in 1970. Ling formed several companies after his time at LTV, but none were as successful. His first comeback try, Omega-Alpha, went bankrupt in 1975.

Ling died of esophageal cancer at his Dallas, Texas home in 2004.

<doc id="791655" wikidata="Q1335058" url="?curid=791655" title="Griffin Bell">
<text>Griffin Boyette Bell (October 31, 1918 – January 5, 2009) was the 72nd Attorney General of the United States, having served under President Jimmy Carter. Previously, he was a U.S. circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

==Education and career==
Born on October 31, 1918, in Americus, Georgia. He served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946 in the Quartermaster Corps and Transportation Corps. He was stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia. He attained the rank of major. After leaving the army, Bell received a Bachelor of Laws in 1948 from Mercer University School of Law. He entered private practice in Savannah, Georgia from 1948 to 1952. He was in private practice in Rome, Georgia from 1952 to 1953 and then was in private practice at King &amp; Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia from 1953 to 1961. He was chief of staff to Governor Ernest Vandiver from 1959 to 1961.

==Federal judicial service==
Bell received a recess appointment from President John F. Kennedy on October 5, 1961, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. He was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 5, 1962, and received his commission on February 9, 1962. He served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center from 1973 to 1976. His service terminated on March 1, 1976, due to his resignation.

===Role in the 1966 Georgia gubernatorial election===
In the aftermath of the disputed 1966 Georgia gubernatorial election between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard &quot;Bo&quot; Callaway, Bell joined Republican Judge Elbert Tuttle in striking down the Georgia constitutional provision requiring that the legislature chose the governor if no general election candidate receives a majority of the vote. The judges concluded that a malapportioned legislature might &quot;dilute&quot; the votes of the candidate with a plurality, in this case Callaway. Bell compared legislative selection to the former County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used in Georgia to select the governor but invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Bell and Tuttle granted a temporary suspension of their ruling to permit appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and stipulated that the state could resolve the deadlock so long as the legislature not make the selection. In a five-to-two decision known as &quot;Fortson v. Morris&quot;, the high court struck down the Bell-Tuttle legal reasoning and directed the legislature to choose between Maddox and Callaway. Two liberal justices, William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas had argued against legislative selection of the governor, but the court majority, led this time by Hugo Black, took the strict constructionist line and cleared the path for Maddox&#x27;s ultimate election.

==Attorney General service==

Bell briefly returned to private practice in Atlanta in 1976. President Jimmy Carter appointed Bell Attorney General of the United States in 1977, and he served until 1979.

===Indictment of L. Patrick Gray===
On April 10, 1978, Attorney General Bell announced the indictment of former acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray, former FBI Assistant Director Mark Felt, and Felt&#x27;s deputy, Edward S. Miller, for authorizing break-ins of New York City radical political activists. Bell introduced requirements that any authorized illegal activities must be made in writing. Five Department of Justices attorneys resigned over the alleged reluctance of Attorney General Bell to pursue others in the department for illegal activities related to domestic spying.

==Later career==

Bell returned to private practice in Atlanta from 1979 until his death in 2009. In September 2004, Bell was appointed the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Military Commission Review. Bell was replaced by Judge Frank J. Williams in July 2007, when the first two cases were appealed to the Court, due to ill health.

==Death==
Griffin Bell died on January 5, 2009, in Atlanta. According to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, Bell was being treated for complications from pancreatic cancer and had been suffering from long-term kidney disease. Governor Sonny Perdue ordered the flag of the United States flown at half-staff in the state of Georgia on January 7, 2009, the day of Bell&#x27;s funeral. He is buried in Americus&#x27; Oak Grove Cemetery, Section N3-South, where his tombstone bears the inscription &quot;Citizen Soldier, Trial Lawyer, Federal Appellate Judge, Attorney General of the United States.&quot;

==Legacy==
Bell had a long-standing relationship with the Georgia Historical Society (GHS). He was a member of the institution for over half a century and from 1996 until his death served as honorary chairman of its advisory board. In 2008, Bell donated his papers to GHS, where they are available for research. See the finding aid for the Griffin B. Bell papers at the Georgia Historical Society.

==Honors and awards==
In December 2008, Bell received an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Georgia Southwestern State University in recognition of his achievements and appreciation for his efforts to promote the interests of his alma mater.

<text>Grand-Mère (, ) is a settlement and former municipality in central Quebec, Canada on the Saint-Maurice River. As a result of the municipal reorganization in Quebec which took effect at the beginning of 2002, Grand-Mère now forms part of the City of Shawinigan. Population in 2001 was 13,179.

==History==
Grand-Mère was founded in 1898. Like some of its neighbouring towns, it owes its economic origins to the St-Maurice river on which it is located. A major hydroelectric dam that was built on the river in 1916 was one of the oldest and largest Hydro-Québec generating stations. The dam was replaced by a larger dam in 2004. The abundance of relatively inexpensive electricity led to the development of industry, primarily based on the production of paper. Logs which were used for the paper pulp were floated downstream on the St-Maurice to the paper mill from more northerly areas. The mill, which has changed ownership over the decades, has had a lasting impact on the town, from the creation of its award-winning golf course to the construction of several of the town&#x27;s historic buildings.

The surrounding area consists of forested hills, lakes, and flat plains and farms, with much glacial activity still evident. The Mauricie region in which Grand-Mère is located has been struggling economically for decades, and boasts some of the most inexpensive real estate in Canada.

The name of the town comes from a rock formation that resembles an old woman with a hair bun at the base of her head (&quot;grand-mère&quot; is French for grandmother). The formation formerly stood in the rapids of the Saint-Maurice River adjacent to the town. When the hydroelectric dam was built, the formation was moved in 1916 and rebuilt. It is now in a small park overlooking the St-Maurice River, at the corner of 4e and 5e Avenues.

The area&#x27;s biggest attraction is La Mauricie National Park.

==Education==
There are five public schools. All of them are affiliated to the &quot;Commission scolaire de l&#x27;Énergie&quot; school board.

==Mayors==
From 1898 to 2001, Grand-Mère had its own mayor and its own city council. The mayors were:

<text>Frank Theodore Levine (born May 29, 1957) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill) in the film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) and Leland Stottlemeyer in the television series &quot;Monk&quot; (2002–2009).

Levine&#x27;s other notable roles are in the films &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (1993), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;Bullet&quot; (1996), &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001), &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004), &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007), &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Report&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Levine was born in Bellaire, Ohio, the son of Charlotte Virginia (Clark) and Milton Dmitri Levine, who were both doctors and members of Physicians for Social Responsibility. Levine&#x27;s father was of Russian-Jewish descent and his mother had Welsh and Native American ancestry. He describes himself as a &quot;hillbilly Jew&quot;. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois. In 1975, he enrolled at Marlboro College.

==Career==
He became a fixture in the Chicago theatre scene and joined the Remains Theatre which was co-founded by Gary Cole and William Petersen. After his stage experience, Levine began to devote most of his energy during the 1980s toward finding roles in film and television. One of his most prominent roles in the 1980s was that of mob enforcer Frank Holman in the NBC drama &quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986–88).

After his breakout role in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; as primary antagonist Jame Gumb, there was a period where he was typecast in villainous roles. He was gradually able to branch out into other types of roles, such as a member of Al Pacino&#x27;s police unit in &quot;Heat,&quot; and astronaut Alan Shepard in the HBO mini-series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. In the drama &quot;Georgia&quot;, he played Mare Winningham&#x27;s husband, one of his most sympathetic roles.

In 2001, Levine performed as Paul Walker&#x27;s police superior Sergeant Tanner in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. He also had an uncredited role as the voice of sociopathic trucker &quot;Rusty Nail&quot; in &quot;Joy Ride,&quot; also starring Walker.

He played Detective Sam Nico in the 2003 film &quot;Wonderland&quot;, based on the gruesome murders in the Hollywood Hills. He also appeared as a psychiatrist at a mental institution in &quot;Wonderland&quot;, an unrelated 2000 TV series of the same name that aired briefly on ABC.

From 2002 to 2009, he co-starred as Captain Leland Stottlemeyer on USA Network&#x27;s detective series &quot;Monk&quot;, starring Tony Shalhoub.

Levine provided the voice of the supervillain Sinestro in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, all part of the DC Animated Universe.

Levine also appeared as a patriarch whose family takes a turn for the worse in the remake of &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (2006).

In 2007, he portrayed Sheriff James Timberlake in &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; and appeared in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster&quot;, alongside Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.

In 2010, he appeared as the warden of the island prison in &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

In 2012, he appeared as Sheriff Bloom Towne in &quot;Deep Dark Canyon&quot;, alongside Spencer Treat Clark and Nick Eversman, who portrayed Sheriff Towne&#x27;s sons, Nate and Skylar, respectively.

In 2013, he had a major supporting role in the FX murder mystery series &quot;The Bridge&quot; as Lieutenant Hank Wade, commander of a police homicide unit in a Texas border city.

In 2014, he portrayed General Underwood in the British-Finnish action film &quot;Big Game&quot;.

In 2018, Levine co-starred in the sequel &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot;, as hunter Ken Wheatley.

From 2018 to 2020, he played Thomas F. Byrnes on the TNT series &quot;The Alienist.&quot;

In 2021, he joined the cast of the ABC drama &quot;Big Sky,&quot; playing the role of Horst Kleinsasser.

<text>Dale Arnold Jarrett (born November 26, 1956) is an American former race car driver and current racing commentator for NBC. He is best known for winning the Daytona 500 three times (in 1993, 1996, and 2000) and winning the NASCAR Winston Cup Series championship in 1999. He is the son of 2-time Grand National Champion Ned Jarrett, younger brother of Glenn Jarrett, father of former driver Jason Jarrett, and cousin of Todd Jarrett. In 2007, Jarrett joined the ESPN/ABC broadcasting team as an announcer in select Nationwide Series races. In 2008, after retiring from driving following the 2008 Food City 500, he joined ESPN permanently as the lead racing analyst replacing Rusty Wallace. In 2015, Jarrett became a part of the NBC Sports Broadcasting Crew for NASCAR events. He was inducted in the 2014 class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Jarrett was born on November 26, 1956, in Conover, North Carolina, the middle child of Ned and Martha. Jarrett has an older brother, Glenn; and a younger sister, Patti. Jarrett&#x27;s father Ned competed in the NASCAR Grand National Division between 1953 and 1966, winning two series championships in 1961 and 1965. Following retirement, Ned remained active in the racing community as manager of Hickory Motor Speedway and later established a career in broadcasting calling Cup races.

Jarrett spent his childhood traveling to his father&#x27;s races across the Southern United States. He was introduced to golf by age twelve; he also played football, basketball and baseball while attending Newton-Conover High School. Jarrett led his high school&#x27;s golf team to three conference championships, and was named the school&#x27;s athlete of the year as a senior. Following graduation in 1975, Jarrett worked at Hickory Motor Speedway, the track his father managed. Jarrett was offered a full golf scholarship from the University of South Carolina, which he declined. Though he continued to play golf, Jarrett was interested in following his father&#x27;s footsteps as a racing driver.

==Racing career==

===Beginnings===
In April 1977, Jarrett entered his first professional race in the Limited Sportsman Division in Hickory. His vehicle, a 1968 Chevrolet Nova, was built by Andy Petree and Jimmy Newsome. Jarrett started last and finished in ninth place; it was after this event when Jarrett knew that he wanted to race for a living. Jarrett continued to compete in the Limited Sportsman Division for two years, before moving up to the Dash Series and then the Late Model Sportsman Division, the latter in which he earned his first victory.

===1982–1986===
Jarrett competed in the 1982 NASCAR Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series for car owner Horace Isenhower. He earned fourteen Top 10 finishes throughout the season, with a best of third place at Hickory; and he finished sixth in the point standings. During the 1983 season, Jarrett earned four poles and seventeen Top 5&#x27;s, finishing fifth in the point standings. For the 1984 Busch Grand National Series, Jarrett received sponsorship from Econo Lodge; Valvoline; and Budweiser. He earned six front-row starts and 19 Top 10&#x27;s, finishing a career-best fourth in the point standings. Jarrett made his Winston Cup Series debut during the 1984 season. Driving the No. 02 Chevrolet for Emanuel Zervakis at Martinsville Speedway, Jarrett qualified 24th and finished 14th. He made two more Cup starts that season, at the Firecracker 400 for Jimmy Means, and the Warner W. Hodgdon American 500. During the 1986 Busch Grand National Series, Jarrett earned his first career victory at Orange County Speedway in Rougemont, North Carolina; piloting the Nationwise Auto Parts Pontiac to victory lane. He also earned six poles in 1986.

===1987–1991===

Jarrett earned his second career victory in the Busch Grand National Series at Hickory during the 1987 season. In the Winston Cup Series, Jarrett replaced Tommy Ellis in the No. 18 Chevrolet owned by Eric Freelander early in the season. Running a primarily-unsponsored car, he had two 10th-place finishes and ended the season 26th in points, second to Davey Allison for Rookie of the Year honors. He ran every race of the 1988 season, despite running with various teams. He made most of his starts in the No. 29 Hardee&#x27;s-sponsored Oldsmobile owned by Cale Yarborough, finishing eighth at Riverside International Raceway. He also ran races for Buddy Arrington and Hoss Ellington that season, finishing 23rd in the final standings. He ran the entire season for Yarborough in 1989, posting five Top 10 finishes, including two fifth-place runs. Jarrett enjoyed the majority of his success in the Busch Series during the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Led by crew chief John Ervin and engine builder Ron Hutter, Jarrett scored victories at Bristol, Charlotte, Rockingham and Darlington (twice). Jarrett began 1990 without a Cup ride before taking over the No. 21 Citgo-sponsored Ford Thunderbird for Wood Brothers Racing at the Valleydale Meats 500, replacing the injured Neil Bonnett. He finished in the Top 10 seven times during the season and finished 25th in the final standings despite missing the first five races of the season. The following season, Jarrett won his first career Winston Cup race at Michigan International Speedway, and finished a then career-best 17th in the final standings.

===1992–1999===
Despite the win, Jarrett left Wood Brothers to drive the No. 18 Interstate Batteries-sponsored Chevrolet for the fledgling Joe Gibbs Racing team. In their first year of competition, Jarrett had two Top 5 finishes but dropped to 19th in points. In 1993, Jarrett won the Daytona 500 after battling Dale Earnhardt (commonly referred to as &quot;The Dale and Dale Show&quot;). While Jarrett did not win again that season, he had a total of 13 Top 5&#x27;s and finished fourth in the final standings. During the spring race at Bristol, Jarrett threw his helmet at the No. 90 car of Bobby Hillin Jr. who crashed Jarrett while he had been lapped. The next season, Jarrett won the Mello Yello 500, but chose to step down from the Gibbs organization at the end of the season. Jarrett signed to drive for Robert Yates in 1995, piloting the No. 28 Texaco-sponsored Ford in place of an injured Ernie Irvan at the Winston Cup level. His Busch Series team also made the switch to Ford as well. With engines provided by Yates and sponsorship from Mac Tools, Jarrett scored four Busch Series wins during the season. However, only three of the wins counted. His win at Michigan was disqualified due to an unapproved engine part.

He won his first Cup race for Yates at Pocono Raceway and finished 13th in the final standings. When it was announced Irvan (who had returned toward the end of the year in a Texaco Havoline-sponsored Yates car numbered 88) would return to the 28 after a year-long absence due to injuries, Yates had planned to help Jarrett compete in his own team with a Hooters sponsorship. The deal fell through, however, and Yates promoted the 88 car to full-time in the Winston Cup Series with Ford assuming the sponsorship through its Quality Care Service and Ford Credit divisions. In 1996, Jarrett won the Daytona 500 for a second time, and finished in the Top 2 in each of the first three races of the season. He also won the Coca-Cola 600, Brickyard 400, and the second Michigan race. Jarrett finished third in the final point standings behind Hendrick Motorsports teammates Terry Labonte and Jeff Gordon. Jarrett&#x27;s kissing of the bricks at Indianapolis started a tradition that has been used by every NASCAR team at the race since then and in the Indianapolis 500 since 2003.

The following season, he won a career-best seven races but lost the championship to Jeff Gordon by 14 points, who by Jarrett&#x27;s own admission on August 25, 2012, was &quot;eleven hundred times the driver I ever dreamed of being&quot;. In 1998, Jarrett won three races, and finished second in the last two races of the year, ending up third in the final point standings to Jeff Gordon, despite suffering gallbladder problems, which made him miss the exhibition race in Japan. After an offseason surgery, Jarrett returned in 1999 and took the points lead after his first win of the season at the Pontiac Excitement 400 and held it for the rest of the season, when he won The Winston Cup title by 201 points over Bobby Labonte with four wins (Richmond, Michigan, Daytona, and Indianapolis), 24 Top 5&#x27;s, a then Modern Era record 29 Top 10&#x27;s, and an average 6.76 finish. He also retired from the Busch Series to become a part-time owner, partnering with National Football League quarterback Brett Favre to field the No. 11 Rayovac-sponsored Ford for his son Jason, Yates teammate Kenny Irwin Jr., and Steve Grissom. He had 11 wins in the Busch Series when he retired.

===2000–2005===

Following his title in 1999, Jarrett won the Daytona 500 for the third time in 2000; however, after only winning one other race and dropping to fourth in the standings, Ford elected to withdraw as the primary sponsor (although Ford Credit remained as the secondary). United Parcel Service (UPS) was signed as the primary sponsor for Jarrett and shortly thereafter, UPS began a multi-year promotional campaign involving the company trying to convince him to drive their trademark &quot;Big Brown Truck&quot; in a race.

In 2001, he won three of the first eight races of the season (Darlington, Texas, and Martinsville) and traded the points lead with Jeff Gordon, with the two of them having the same point totals for a few different weeks, but won only once more at New Hampshire in July and faded back to fifth in the standings. In addition, Jarrett suffered a concussion from a hard crash at the new Kansas Speedway. In an interview, Jarrett said that he did remember not being in the Protection One 400 but only getting on the plane to go to the racetrack. After that season, Jarrett&#x27;s long-time crew chief Todd Parrott departed and Jimmy Elledge took over the role as a replacement. After seven races of the 2002 season, Jarrett and Parrott reunited, and Jarrett went on to clinch two victories (Pocono and Michigan) and rebounded to ninth in the final standings after the poor start to the year.

Jarrett began the 2003 season by winning at North Carolina Speedway but only posted five more Top 10 finishes, relegating him to 26th in the final standings. He rebounded in 2004 to finish 15th in points, despite not winning a race for the first time since 1992. In 2005, Jarrett had an up-and-down year in 2005. In the Busch Series Bristol race, he was involved in a crash with Shane Hmiel. When Jarrett confronted him under a red flag, Hmiel flipped him off drawing a fine from NASCAR. Jarrett was not penalized for any part he had in the wreck. Later, Jarrett got his last career Cup series win at Talladega Superspeedway, again finishing 15th in the standings.

===2006–2008===

During the 2006 season, Jarrett had four Top 10 finishes, with a best finish of 4th at Kansas. His best starting position was 2nd and he finished 23rd in points. It was his last year racing for Yates, as he and his sponsor UPS left for Michael Waltrip Racing&#x27;s new No. 44 Toyota team.

Jarrett started the 2007 Nextel Cup season on a high note as he drew pole position for the annual exhibition race, the Budweiser Shootout, at Daytona. He finished 18th out of 21 cars. Since Jarrett&#x27;s team was a brand new team and had no owner points, and due to a rule change, he was eligible to use the Past Champion&#x27;s Provisional five times as his 1999 championship was the most recent among past champions who were driving for teams not in the top 35 in owner points; prior to the rule change the use of a Past Champion&#x27;s Provisional was not limited.

Jarrett was forced to use all six of his provisionals at the start of the season, starting at Daytona mainly because Michael Waltrip Racing was penalized by NASCAR for an illegal fuel additive during Speedweeks and the penalties knocked Jarrett, Waltrip and Reutimann out of the Top 35 in owner points-the safety net for qualifying regardless of rain and cancellations of qualifying.

Jarrett started 43rd in the Daytona 500 and finished 22nd. Jarrett used his last champion&#x27;s provisional at the spring Talladega race, Aaron&#x27;s 499. For the rest of 2007, Jarrett had to get into that weekend&#x27;s race on time. Jarrett missed 12 races in 2007 as a result.

During an interview on Speed, Jarrett said after his contract is up with MWR (which was expected to be in the 2009 season), he would retire, but the timetable was pushed up in October 2007 prior to the 2007 Bank of America 500. Jarrett retired from points racing after the 2008 Food City 500, turning the No. 44 Toyota ride to David Reutimann. His final race was the All-Star race on May 17, 2008, after which he joined ESPN&#x27;s NASCAR coverage full-time as a booth announcer.

However, Jarrett was not guaranteed to start the first five races using the champion&#x27;s provisional as he had the year before as Kurt Busch, the 2004 champion, had his team&#x27;s owner points transferred to his teammate Sam Hornish Jr. and would be first to receive it. Jarrett started off 2008 with a 16th-place finish at Daytona. He retired from points racing after the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. At the weekend&#x27;s pre-race driver&#x27;s meeting, he spoke to the other drivers, saying

Enjoy this. We all have our time in this, and mine has been fantastic. To me, it has been an honor and a privilege to be able to race in this series and say I raced with and against and sometimes beat the best in the world. Thanks for allowing me to do that. Enjoy it. It&#x27;s a great sport, and you guys make it what it is.

<text>René Arthur Gagnon (March 7, 1925 – October 12, 1979) was a United States Marine Corps corporal who participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II.
Gagnon was generally known as being one of the Marines who raised the second U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as depicted in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; by photographer Joe Rosenthal. On October 16, 2019, the Marine Corps announced publicly (after an investigation) that Corporal Harold Keller, not Gagnon, was in Rosenthal&#x27;s photo. Gagnon was one of three men who were originally identified incorrectly as flag-raisers in the photograph (the others being Hank Hansen and John Bradley).

The first flag that had been raised was deemed too small. Later that day, Gagnon, a runner in the 5th Marine Division, was given a larger flag to take up the mountain. A photo of the second flag-raising became famous and was widely reproduced. After the battle, Gagnon and two other men who were identified as surviving second flag-raisers were reassigned to help raise funds for the Seventh War Loan drive.

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, is modeled after Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of six Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima.

== Early years ==

Gagnon was born March 7, 1925, in Manchester, New Hampshire, the only child of French Canadian immigrants from Disraeli, Quebec, Henri Gagnon (1905–1966) and Irène Marcotte (1901–1988). He grew up without a father. His parents separated when he was an infant, though they never divorced. When he was old enough, he worked alongside his mother at a local shoe factory. He also worked as a bicycle messenger boy for the local Western Union.

== U.S. Marine Corps ==

=== World War II ===

Gagnon was inducted into the United States Marine Corps Reserve on May 6, 1943. He was sent to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. On July 16, he was promoted to private first class. He was transferred to the Marine Guard Company at Charleston Navy Yard in South Carolina and remained there for eight months. On April 4, 1944, he joined the Military Police Company of the 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. On April 8, 1944, he was transferred to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. In September, the 5th division left Camp Pendleton for further training at Camp Tarawa, Hawaii. The 5th Division trained there to prepare for the assault on Iwo Jima by three Marine divisions of the V Amphibious Corps (code named &quot;Operation Detachment&quot;).

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====

On February 19, 1945, Pfc. Gagnon landed on the southeast side of Iwo Jima with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, on &quot;Green Beach 1&quot;, which was the closest landing beach to Mount Suribachi on the southern end of the island. On February 23, Pfc. Gagnon who was the battalion runner (messenger) for Easy Company, incorrectly became a part of what was most likely the most celebrated American flag raising in U.S. history.

==== First flag-raising ====
On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company&#x27;s commander Captain Dave Severance to send a platoon-sized patrol from his company up Mount Suribachi to lay siege to and occupy the crest. The remainder of Third platoon, other Marines from the battalion, and two Navy corpsmen, formed a 40-man patrol. If they made it to the top, First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, E Company&#x27;s executive officer who was selected by the 28th Marines commander to lead the patrol, was to raise the Second Battalion&#x27;s flag on top to signal that the mountaintop was secure. On orders from Lt. Col Johnson, First Lieutenant George G. Wells the battalion adjutant handed Lt. Schrier the flag just before the patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30 a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim, he and two other Marines attached the flag to a length of Japanese iron water pipe that was found. Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg, raised the flag at approximately 10:30 a.m. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the south end beaches of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beach. Third Platoon corpsman John Bradley pitched in with Private Phil Ward to help make the flagstaff stay vertical. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff which included Lt. Schrier&#x27;s radio operator, Private First Class Raymond Jacobs (assigned to patrol from F Company), were photographed several times by Staff Sergeant Lou Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

==== Second flag-raising ====
Approximately two hours after the first flag was raised, Lt. Col. Johnson decided that a larger U.S. flag should replace it so the flag could be more visible on the other side of the mountain where thousands of Marines were fighting to take the island. Sgt. Michael Strank, a rifle squad leader of Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered by Captain Severance to take three of his Marines up to the top of Mount Suribachi and raise a second flag which was obtained from one of the ships docked on shore. Sgt. Strank selected Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley. Capt. Severance also ordered Pfc. Gagnon, E Company&#x27;s runner, to take radio batteries and the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the battalion&#x27;s flag.

Once the four Marines and Pfc. Gagnon were on top, a Japanese pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley and taken near the first flag position where Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were preparing the ground where it would be raised from. The replacement flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines to help them raise the flagstaff. Under Lt. Schrier&#x27;s orders, Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block (incorrectly identified as Sgt. Hansen until January 1947), Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Private First Class Harold Schultz, and Private First Class Harold Keller raised the flag as the first flagstaff was lowered by Pfc. Gagnon and three Marines at approximately 1 p.m. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were both members of Lt. Schrier&#x27;s patrol. Afterwards, rocks were added to the bottom of the flagstaff which was then stabilized by three guy-ropes. The second raising was immortalized by the black-and-white photograph of the flag raising by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press. Marine photographer Sergeant Bill Genaust also filmed the second flag raising in color. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed on Iwo Jima on March 2 and Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4. Sgt. Strank and Cpl Block were killed on March 1 and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.

On March 14, 1945, a third American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post located on the other side of Mount Suribachi; the second flag on Mount Suribachi was taken down at the same time and delivered to the Second Battalion&#x27;s headquarters. The battle of Iwo Jima was officially over on March 26 and a service was held at the 5th Marine Division cemetery. On March 27, the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines and Pfc. Gagnon left Iwo Jima for Hawaii, and both of the U.S. flags that were flown on Mount Suribachi were sent to Marine Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In 1991, former Marine Lt. George Greeley Wells, who was the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, adjutant in charge of carrying the American flag(s) for the battalion on Iwo Jima, stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was ordered by the battalion commander on February 23, 1945, to get a large replacement flag for the one on top of Mount Suribachi, and that he (Wells) ordered Pfc. Gagnon, the battalion&#x27;s runner for E Company, to get a larger flag from a ship on shore—possibly the . Wells stated that this flag was the one taken up Mount Suribachi by Pfc. Gagnon to be given to Lt. Schrier, with a message for Lt. Schrier to raise this flag and return the smaller flag raised earlier on Mount Suribachi back to Gagnon. Wells also stated, that he had handed the original flag to Lt. Schrier that he (Lt. Schrier) took up Mount Suribachi, and when this flag was returned to him (Wells) by Pfc. Gagnon, he secured the flag until it was delivered to Marine Headquarters in Washington, D.C., after the Second Battalion returned to Hawaii from Iwo Jima.

==== Government war bond tour ====
In February or March 1945, President Roosevelt ordered that the flag raisers in Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph be sent immediately after the battle to Washington, D.C., to appear as a public morale factor. Pfc. Gagnon had returned with his unit to Camp Tarawa in Hawaii when he was ordered on April 3 to report to Marine Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C. He arrived on April 7, and was questioned by a lieutenant colonel at the Marine Corps public information office concerning the identities of those in the photograph (Rosenthal did not take names). On April 8, the Marine Corps gave a press release of the names of the six flag raisers in the Rosenthal photo given by Gagnon: Marines Michael Strank (KIA), Henry Hansen (KIA), Franklin Sousley (KIA), Ira Hayes, Navy corpsman John Bradley, and himself. After Gagnon gave the names of the flag raisers, Bradley and Hayes were ordered to report to Marine Corps headquarters; after the war, the Marine Corps determined that Hansen (1947), Bradley (2016), and Gagnon (2019) were not second flag-raisers.

After President Roosevelt unexpectedly died on April 12, Vice President Harry S. Truman was sworn in as president the same day. Bradley was recovering from his wounds from Iwo Jima at Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California, and was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he was shown Rosenthal&#x27;s flag-raising photograph and was told he was in it. He arrived in Washington, D.C., on crutches on or about April 19. Hayes arrived from Hawaii on April 19. Both men were questioned separately by the same Marine officer that Gagnon met with concerning the identities of the six flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. Bradley agreed with all six names of the flag raisers in the photo given by Gagnon including his own. Hayes agreed with all the names too including his own except he said the man identified as Sgt. Hansen at the base of the flagstaff in the photo was really Cpl. Harlon Block. The Marine interviewer then told Hayes that a list of the names of the six flag-raisers in the photo were already released publicly and besides Block and Hansen were both killed in action (during the Marine Corps investigation in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block&#x27;s name to him). After the interview, it was requested that Pfc. Gagnon, Pfc. Hayes, and Bradley participate in the Seventh War Loan drive. On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met President Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the flag-raising poster that was on display there for the coming bond tour that they would participate in. A press conference was also held that day and Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag-raising. The three were assigned to temporary duty with the Finance Division, U.S. Treasury Department.

On May 9, the bond tour started with a flag-raising ceremony at the nation&#x27;s capitol by Pfc. Gagnon, Pfc. Hayes, and PhM2c. Bradley, using the same flag that had been raised on Mount Suribachi. The tour began on May 11 in New York City. On May 24, Pfc. Hayes was ordered to report to the 28th Marines in Hawaii. Pfc. Hayes left Washington by plane on May 25 and arrived at Hilo, Hawaii on May 29 and rejoined E Company at Camp Tawara. Pfc. Gagnon and PhM2c. Bradley finished the tour in Washington, D.C., on July 4. The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war.

On July 5, Gagnon was ordered to San Diego for further transfer overseas. On July 7, he got married in Baltimore, Maryland, to Pauline Georgette Harnois of Hooksett, New Hampshire.
By September, he was deployed overseas with the 80th Replacement Draft. On November 7, he arrived at Tsingtao, China, where he joined E Company, 2nd Battalion, 29th Marines, 6th Marine Division. He later served with the 3rd Battalion, 29th Marines. In March 1946, he had been on duty with the U.S. occupation forces in China for about five months before he boarded a ship at Tsingtao at the end of the month for San Diego. Gagnon arrived in San Diego on April 20. He was promoted to corporal and was honorably discharged at Camp Pendleton, California, on April 27.

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, which was inspired by Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. Gagnon was depicted as the second figure from the bottom of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze figures of the other five flag-raisers depicted on the monument until a Marine Corps investigation determined in October 2019 that he was not a flag raiser; Gagnon had personally posed for the sculptor.

During the dedication, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Ira Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers (the other two were Harold Schultz and Harold Keller) depicted on the monument was also seated upfront with Rene Gagnon, John Bradley (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until June 2016), Mrs. Martha Strank, Mrs. Ada Belle Block, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day; Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation; General Shepherd, who presented the memorial to the American people; Felix de Weldon, sculptor; and Richard Nixon, who gave the dedication address. The Memorial was turned over to the National Park Service in 1955. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

== Later years and death ==
=== Return to Iwo Jima ===

On February 19, 1965, while working as an airline sales representative for Delta Air Lines, Gagnon visited Mount Suribachi with his wife and son.

René Gagnon, Jr. commented in 2014 that his father René Gagnon, Sr. opened a travel agency and did accounting work, and in his last job, he had worked as head of maintenance at an apartment complex in Manchester, where he suffered a heart attack in the boiler room. According to the book &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2000), in his later years Gagnon participated in events only at his wife&#x27;s urging, events praising the U.S. flag raising on Iwo Jima. She enjoyed the limelight, whereas he, by that time, no longer did. 
=== Death ===
Gagnon died on October 12, 1979, at age 54, in Manchester, New Hampshire. He resided in nearby Hooksett, and was survived by wife Pauline Gagnon and son René Gagnon, Jr. at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester. At the request of his widow, a government waiver was granted on April 16, 1981, and his remains were re-interred in Section 51, Grave 543 of Arlington National Cemetery on July 7. Inscribed on the back of his Arlington headstone are the words:

== Military awards ==

Gagnon&#x27;s military awards include the following:

*Navy Presidential Unit Citation 
*China Service Medal
*American Campaign Medal
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with &quot; bronze star
*World War II Victory Medal

== Public honors ==

* Rene Gagnon monument (1995), Victory Park, Manchester, New Hampshire (has quote by Gagnon: &quot;Do not glorify war. There&#x27;s nothing glorious about it.&quot;) 
* Wright Museum of WWII History, Rene Gagnon exhibit, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. which has not been removed yet despite the revelation that he was not the flag raiser.

== Portrayal in films ==

Gagnon appeared in two films about the Battle of Iwo Jima: &quot;To the Shores of Iwo Jima&quot; (a government documentary which simply showed the color footage of the U.S. flag raising) and &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949). He was also part of a Rose Bowl halftime show.

*&quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949), Gagnon played himself, raising the flag in the movie with John Bradley and Ira Hayes.
*&quot;The Outsider&quot; (1961), Gagnon was played by Ray Daley.
*&quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006), Gagnon was played by Jesse Bradford

== Second flag-raiser corrections ==
A Marine Corps investigation of the identities of the six second flag-raisers began in December 1946 and concluded in January 1947 that it was Cpl. Harlon Block (KIA) and not Sgt. Henry Hansen (KIA) at the base of the flagstaff in the Rosenthal photograph, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter. The identities of the other five second flag-raisers were confirmed.

In 2016, the Marine Corps review board launched another investigation, announcing in June 2016 that former Marine Harold Schultz was in the photograph and former Navy corpsman John Bradley was not. Pfc. Franklin Sousley (KIA), not Harold Schultz, is now in the position initially ascribed to Bradley (fourth from left) in the photograph and Schultz is now in Sousley&#x27;s former position (second from left) in the photograph. The identities of the other five flag-raisers were confirmed. Schultz never publicly mentioned his role as a flag-raiser or that he was in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph.

In October 2019, a third Marine Corps investigation concluded that former Marine Harold Keller, not Rene Gagnon (fifth from left), was actually depicted in Rosenthal&#x27;s photo. Gagnon carried the larger second flag up Mount Suribachi, helped lower the first flagstaff, and removed the first flag at the time the second flag was raised. The identities of the other five flag raisers were confirmed. Like Schultz, Keller never publicly mentioned his role in the flag-raising or that he was in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph.

<text>Michael Strank (November 10, 1919March 1, 1945, born Mykhal Strenk) was a United States Marine Corps sergeant who was killed in action during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. He was one of the Marines who raised the second U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; by photographer Joe Rosenthal. Of the six Marines depicted in the photo, Strank was the only one to be correctly identified from the beginning; the other five were either assigned the wrong locations (Ira Hayes and Franklin Sousley), or, were given the names of Marines who were not in the photo.

The first flag raised over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was deemed too small. Later that day, Strank, a rifle company squad leader in the 5th Marine Division, was ordered up the mountain with three Marines to raise a larger flag. A photograph of the second flag-raising became famous and was widely reproduced. The second flag raising was also filmed in color. Before Iwo Jima, Strank served with the Marine Raiders in the Battle of Bougainville.

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, was modeled after Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of six Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima.

== Early life ==
Michael Strank was born in a Rusyn family in the Prešov village of Orjabyna in Czechoslovakia (present-day Jarabina in the Stará Ľubovňa district), Prešov Region of northeastern Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia). His two brothers, Petro and John, and his sister Mary were born in the United States to Vasil Strenk (later, in the U.S., known as Charles Strank) and Marta Grófiková, Rusyn immigrants. In his application for American citizenship, Vasil Strenk&#x27;s father indicated the nationality of his family as Ruthenian. Vasil Strank moved to Franklin Borough (near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States), found work in the coal mines for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and brought his family to Pennsylvania three years later, when he could pay for their voyage. Strank attended the public schools of Franklin Borough and graduated from Franklin Borough High School in 1937. He joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, served for 18 months, and afterwards became a Pennsylvania state highway laborer.

== U.S. Marine Corps ==
Strank enlisted in the Marine Corps at Pittsburgh for four years service on October 6, 1939. He was assigned to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina. He completed recruit training in December and was transferred to Headquarters Company, Post Troop and then to Provisional Company W at Parris Island, on January 17, 1941. Private First Class Strank sailed for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, arriving on January 23, 1941. He was reassigned to Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Brigade (on February 1, the 1st Marine Brigade was redesignated the 1st Marine Division). On April 8, now assigned to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, he returned to the United States and was sent back to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. He was promoted to corporal on April 23, 1941. In September, Cpl. Strank moved with the 1st Marine Division to New River (North Carolina) (Camp Lejeune), which is where he was stationed when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred.

=== World War II ===

On January 26, 1942, Cpl. Strank was promoted to sergeant. On March 21, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines was detached from the 1st Marine Division and attached to the newly created 3rd Marine Brigade. In early April, he was sent with the battalion to San Diego, California and deployed on April 12 (sailed April 13) to Samoa arriving in American Samoa on April 28; the 7th Marines were ordered to Samoa. On May 31, his battalion was transferred to Wallis (Urea) Island. In August, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines was detached from the 3rd Marine Brigade and reassigned to the 1st Marine Division; also during August, the 22nd Marine Regiment relieved the 7th Marines which were ordered to reinforce Marine units fighting on Guadalcanal; a battalion of the 22nd Marines relieved the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines on Urea. In September, after a short time with the 22nd Marines, Sgt. Strank was transferred to the newly organized 3rd Marine Raider Battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge; D Company, 3rd Raider Battalion was organized on Urea and joined the rest of the 3rd Raider Battalion at Pago Pago, American Samoa on December 21. In January and February 1943, the 3rd Raiders were sent to Espiritu Santo (Camp Rennie), New Hebrides, Islands and Guadalcanal, British Solomon Islands.

As a member of the 3rd Raiders using 10-man rubber boats in their first offensive action, Sgt. Strank (D Company) participated in the unopposed landing operations and occupation of Pavuvu (Operation Cleanslate) in the Russell Islands from February 21 to March 18, 1943. On March 19, the battalion left the island and returned to Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo (Camp Rennie) on March 20. On May 1, D Company was designated as M Company, 3rd Raider Battalion, 1st Marine Raider Regiment, 1st Marine Amphibious Corps.

On November 1, 1943, the 2nd and 3rd Raider Battalions spearheaded the initial invasion of Bougainville by the 3rd Marine Division. Sgt. Strank, M Company, 3rd Raiders, landed on Green Beach #2 at Cape Torokina and participated in the seizure and occupation of Empress Augusta Bay (Operation Cherryblossom). On January 12, the 3rd Raiders were removed from the combat zone and returned to Guadalcanal, arriving on January 14. On February 1, the 1st Marine Raider Regiment was redesignated the 4th Marine Regiment. The 3rd Raider Battalion was disbanded and designated the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment. On February 14, Sgt. Strank was sent to San Diego and allowed a leave to visit his family.

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====
Sgt. Strank returned to duty in San Diego and was assigned to Second Platoon, Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, as a squad leader. He was sent to Hawaii with his unit after extensive training, and began more training and preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima.

==== First flag-raising ====

Sgt. Strank took part in the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, amphibious assault landing on Green Beach at the southern part of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi on February 19, 1945. The mission of the 28th Marines that day was to isolate Mount Suribachi, which it accomplished. The next day, the regiment secured the southern end of the island. Their mission afterwards, was to capture Mount Suribachi. After heavy opposition, the 28th Marines surrounded the mountain by the evening of February 22. On the morning of February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, commander of the Second Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered E Company&#x27;s executive officer, First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, to take a platoon-sized patrol up 556-foot high Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest, and if possible, raise the battalion&#x27;s American flag to signal the summit was secure. E Company&#x27;s commander, Captain Dave Severance, assembled a 40-man patrol for the mission from the remainder of his Third Platoon and other members from the battalion.

The patrol left the base of Mount Suribachi at about 8:30 a.m. Once Lt. Schrier was on top with his men after some occasional sniper fire and a brief firefight at the rim of the crater, he and his men secured the top. After a Japanese steel pipe was found, Lt. Schrier and two other Marines attached the flag to it. The flagstaff was then taken to the highest position on top and raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg at about 10:30 a.m. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beaches at the southern end of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beaches. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant Louis R. Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed in action on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

==== Second flag-raising ====


In order for the American flag to be seen more by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Mount Suribachi where most of the Japanese soldiers were located, it was decided that a larger flag should replace the battalion&#x27;s flag on Mount Suribachi. Captain Severance ordered Sgt. Strank to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon and raise the replacement flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Corporal Harlon Block, Private First Class Ira Hayes, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley to go with him up Mount Suribachi with communication wire (or supplies). Private First Class Rene Gagnon, the Second Battalion&#x27;s runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag.

Once Sgt. Strank&#x27;s team was on top, Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley found a Japanese steel pipe to attach the flag to. After the two Marines took the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag, the flag was attached to the pipe. As the four Marines got into position to raise the flagstaff, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block called out to two nearby Marines to help them raise the heavy flagstaff. Then, under Lt. Schrier&#x27;s orders, the second flag was raised at approximately 1 p.m. by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Harold Schultz, and Pfc. Harold Keller, as the original flag came down. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller were members of Lt. Schrier&#x27;s patrol. In order to keep the second flagstaff in a vertical position in the high winds on the summit, rocks were immediately added to the base of the flagstaff by Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller, and another Marine. Three guy-ropes were then tied to the flagstaff to stabilize it. The six Marine flag-raisers were photographed in action by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal and by Marine motion picture cameraman Sergeant William (Bill) Genaust (later killed in action) in color. After the second flag-raising, Rosenthal photographed sixteen Marines including Sgt. Strank and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff. Rosenthal&#x27;s black-and-white flag-raising picture, which appeared in newspapers on February 25, 1945, was later titled Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. It became the most copied photograph in Marine Corps history.

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lt. Gen. Holland Smith during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the 3rd Marine Division troops were located. The flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi since February 23 was taken down. On March 26, 1945, the island was considered secure and the battle of Iwo Jima was officially ended. The 28th Marines left Iwo Jima on March 27 and returned to Hawaii to the 5th Marine Division training camp. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed in action on March 2, Sgt. Genaust was killed on March 4, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.

On March 20, President Roosevelt ordered all the men in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph be sent to Washington D.C. after the battle was over. Pfc. Gagnon arrived alone on April 7 and was questioned at Marine Headquarters by a public information officer about the identities of the six flag raisers. Pfc. Gagnon identified Navy corpsman John Bradley and Pfc. Ira Hayes as flag raisers in the photograph and they were sent for and arrived on April 19 and, they were separately questioned that day (Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Sousley were killed on Iwo Jima). All three said they were in the photograph and raised the flag; on April 8, they had been named publicly by the Marine Corps as the surviving flag raisers. Over time it was discovered that all of the second flag-raisers were Marines and that three of the six Marines in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph were not correctly identified: Cpl. Block was not recognized until January 1947, Pfc. Schultz was not recognized until June 2016, and Pfc. Keller was not recognized until October 2019. Cpl. Block was incorrectly identified in the photograph as Henry Hansen. Pfc. Schultz was identified as Pfc. Sousley in the photograph. In turn, Pfc. Sousley was identified as PhM2c. Bradley in the photograph. Pfc. Keller was incorrectly identified as Pfc. Gagnon in the photograph. Rosenthal did not take the names of any of the flag raisers in his photograph. Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller did not ever claim publicly to be in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph or that they were flag-raisers.

==== Death and burial ====
On February 28, Sgt. Strank and E Company moved northward. Fighting was heavy, and both the Japanese and the American forces were taking heavy casualties. On March 1, Sgt. Strank&#x27;s rifle squad came under heavy fire and took cover. While forming a plan of attack, he was killed by friendly artillery fire. The shell that killed him was almost certainly fired from offshore by an American ship. Cpl. Harlon Block, Sgt. Strank&#x27;s assistant squad leader, took command of the squad. Cpl. Block was killed later on the same day by a Japanese mortar shell. However, former Marine Ralph Griffiths of Second Platoon, Easy Company, said that Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were on both sides of him on March 1 and were killed by the same shell which wounded him. Sgt. Strank and the other Marines killed in action of the 28th Regiment were buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on the island with the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Sgt. Strank (and possibly Cpl. Block) was the first person in Rosenthal&#x27;s flag raising photograph to be killed. On January 13, 1949, his remains were reinterred in Grave 7179, Section 12, Arlington National Cemetery.

Sgt. Strank&#x27;s brother, Peter Strank, was serving aboard the aircraft carrier &quot;USS Franklin&quot; in the South Pacific when Sgt. Strank was killed.

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==

The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. Sculptor Felix de Weldon was inspired to make the memorial after seeing Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of the second flag raising. De Weldon duplicated the flag raisers images and positions on the memorial from the photograph. Strank is depicted as the fourth bronze figure from the base of the flagstaff on the memorial with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze figures of the other five flag raisers depicted on the memorial. The Marine Corps announced on June 23, 2016, that Harold Schultz is now in back of Strank instead of Franklin Sousley, who is now in front of Strank instead of John Bradley, who is no longer in the photograph. The Memorial was turned over to the National Park Service in 1955.

During the dedication, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Orme Lewis, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. 
Ira Hayes, one of the three surviving flag-raisers depicted on the monument, was seated together with John Bradley, Rene Gagnon Mrs. Martha Strank, Ada Belle Block, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day; Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation; General Shepherd, who presented the memorial to the American people; Felix de Weldon, sculptor; and Richard Nixon, who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

Strank&#x27;s military decorations and awards include:

==Legacy==

Strank was born on November 10, the Marine Corps birthday. The members of Strank&#x27;s rifle squad idolized him (Cpl. Harlon Block for one followed his every instruction without question), and many men since who served with and alongside him have stated he had a way of setting them at ease, making them feel that &quot;he&quot; could help them survive the war. Of the men photographed raising the second flag on Mount Suribachi, Strank at age 25, was the oldest, and Harold Keller and him the most experienced in combat.

In interviews of former Marines conducted years later, many documented in the book &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; written by James Bradley (son of corpsman John Bradley), he is described by men who served with him as &quot;a Marine&#x27;s Marine&quot;, a true warrior and leader, who led his men by example. Strank often told his men, &quot;Follow me, and I&#x27;ll try to bring you all safely home to your mothers.&quot; One former Marine who served with Strank stated, &quot;He was the kind of Marine you read about, the kind they make movies about.&quot; Former Paramarine Lowell B. Holly, who served in Strank&#x27;s squad on Iwo Jima and who was with Strank when he died, stated, &quot;He was the best Marine I ever knew.&quot;

== U.S. citizenship ==

In 2008, Gunnery Sergeant Matt Blais, who was a Marine security guard in the American Embassy in Slovakia, discovered that Strank was not a natural-born U.S. citizen. Strank had become a U.S. citizen after his father&#x27;s naturalization in 1935, but had never received official documentation.
GySgt. Blais petitioned the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services on Strank&#x27;s behalf and on July 29, 2008, Strank&#x27;s youngest sister, Mary Pero, was presented with his certificate of citizenship in a ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial.

==Portrayal in film==
Strank is prominently featured in the 2006 movie &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;. In the movie, Sgt. Strank is played by Canadian actor Barry Pepper. The movie is based on the 2000 book of the same title.

In 2016, Radio and Television of Slovakia filmed a documentary about Sgt. Strank called &quot;Chlapec, ktorý chcel byť prezidentom&quot; (&quot;The boy who wanted to be a president&quot;). It was aired for the first time on May 2, 2017.

In 2019, an English version of the documentary &quot;Chlapec, ktorý chcel byť prezidentom&quot; had premiered in the United States under the title, &quot;The Oath&quot;.

<doc id="791670" wikidata="Q1888605" url="?curid=791670" title="Merkle's Puzzles">
<text>In cryptography, Merkle&#x27;s Puzzles is an early construction for a public-key cryptosystem, a protocol devised by Ralph Merkle in 1974 and published in 1978. It allows two parties to agree on a shared secret by exchanging messages, even if they have no secrets in common beforehand.

==Description==
Suppose Alice and Bob wish to communicate. Bob can send a message to Alice as follows: first he creates a large number of puzzles, each of a moderate amount of difficulty — it must be possible for Alice to solve the puzzle with a moderate amount of computing effort. The puzzles are in the form of an encrypted message with an unknown key; the key must be short enough to allow a brute force attack. Bob sends all of the puzzles (i.e. encrypted messages) to Alice, who chooses one randomly, and solves it. The decrypted solution contains an identifier as well as a session key, so Alice can communicate back to Bob which puzzle she has solved. Both parties now have a common key; Alice, because she solved a puzzle, and Bob, because he sent the puzzle. Any eavesdropper (Eve, say) has a harder task — she does not know which puzzle was solved by Alice. Her best strategy is to solve all the puzzles, but since there are so many, this is more computationally expensive for Eve than it is for Alice.

===High-level description===

# Bob generates 2N messages containing, &quot;This is message X. This is the symmetrical key Y&quot;, where X is a randomly generated identifier, and Y is a randomly generated secret key meant for symmetrical encryption. Hence, both X and Y are unique to each message. All the messages are encrypted in a way such that a user may conduct a brute force attack on each message with some difficulty. Bob sends all the encrypted messages to Alice.
# Alice receives all the encrypted messages, and randomly chooses a single message to brute force. After Alice discovers both the identifier X and the secret key Y inside that message, she encrypts her clear text with the secret key Y, and sends that identifier (in cleartext) with her cipher text to Bob.
# Bob looks up the secret key paired with that identifier, since he&#x27;s the one who generated them in the first place, and deciphers Alice&#x27;s cipher text with that secret key.

Note that the eavesdropper Eve can read the identifier X sent back (in cleartext) from Alice to Bob, but has no way to map that to the secret key Y that Bob and Alice are now using for their ongoing communication, because the value of X within each message was randomly generated.

==Complexity and security analysis==

The parameters of the puzzle game can be chosen to make it considerably harder to for an eavesdropper to break the code than for the parties to communicate, but Merkle puzzles do not provide the enormous qualitative differences in difficulty that are required for (and define) security in modern cryptography.

Suppose that the number of puzzles sent by Bob is &quot;m&quot;, and it takes both Bob and Alice &quot;n&quot; steps of computation to solve one puzzle. Then both can deduce a common session key within a time complexity of O(&quot;m+n&quot;). Eve, in contrast, is required to solve all puzzles, which takes her O(&quot;mn&quot;) of time. If &quot;m&quot; ≈ &quot;n&quot;, the effort for Eve has roughly quadratic complexity compared to Alice and Bob, i.e., her computation time is on the order of the square of theirs. &quot;n&quot; should thus be selected large enough such that computation is still feasible for Alice and Bob while it surmounts the capabilities of Eve.

Quadratic complexity is typically not considered secure enough against an attacker (or on the other extreme, for large m,n, convenient enough for the participants) for practical real-world cryptographic applications. However, this scheme has the distinction of being one of the first examples of public-key cryptography, and was an inspiration for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, which has much higher complexity, relying on the discrete logarithm problem.

In 2008 Boaz Barak and Mohammad Mahmoody-Ghidary showed (&quot;Merkle Puzzles Are Optimal&quot;) that this quadratic bound cannot be improved upon.

<text>Bongor () is a city in Chad, the capital of the region of Mayo-Kebbi Est. It is located on the eastern bank of the Logone River. During the rainy season (May–September), the Logone is navigable between Bongor and N&#x27;Djamena, Chad&#x27;s capital. The population is 29,268 (2008).

Bongor has a lively central market square, an airport, a post office, a hospital, and the administrative offices for the Mayo-Kebbi Prefecture. Cotton and rice are the primary cash crops of the region. There is a hotel on the bank of the Logone. The principal market day is Monday and people come from the entire region for the weekly market.

Bongor was a part of German Cameroon until the 1911 German-French Treaty. In 1904, a military station was founded near Bongor by German colonial officer Herbert Kund, constituting the beginning of the city&#x27;s modern history. The primary indigenous tribal group are the Masa people. The city has been an important centre of secondary education since colonial times. The Lycée Jacques Moudeina is located in the city and many of the future leaders of the nations that became independent after the dissolution of the colony of French Equatorial Africa attended the Lycée.

<doc id="791679" wikidata="Q3520148" url="?curid=791679" title="Brown Derby">
<text>Brown Derby was a chain of restaurants in Los Angeles, California. The first and best known was shaped like a derby hat, an iconic image that became synonymous with the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was opened by Wilson Mizner in 1926. The chain was started by Robert H. Cobb and Herbert K. Somborn (a former husband of film star Gloria Swanson) in the 1920s. The original Brown Derby restaurants had closed or had been converted to other uses by the 1980s, though a Disney-backed Brown Derby national franchising program revived the brand in the 21st century. It is often incorrectly thought that the Brown Derby was a single restaurant, and the Wilshire Boulevard and Hollywood branches are frequently confused.

There is a non-related chain of steakhouse restaurants founded in 1941 in Akron, Ohio, and franchised in 1962. This chain was founded by Ted and Gus Girves, and the full name of these restaurants is &quot;Girves Brown Derby&quot;. , five of the Girves chain are still in business.

== Wilshire Boulevard Brown Derby ==
===First Wilshire Derby===

The first restaurant was opened in February 1926 at 3427 Wilshire Boulevard in a building built in the distinctive shape of a derby hat. Whimsical architecture was then in vogue, and the restaurant was designed to catch the eye of passing motorists. The Brown Derby name originated from a Malverne, New York-based restaurant of the same name that had been a hang-out for vaudevillians in the 1920s. It was founded by Wilson Mizner as a small cafe, across the street from the Hollywood hot spot the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador Hotel. Wilson was the front man; Herbert K. Somborn owned the property and Jack L. Warner put up the money. Wilson Mizner sat in booth 50 almost every day. Unfortunately the original restaurant was small and suffered from acoustic problems in which sound from one end of the building bounced off the semicircular ceiling and traveled to the other side of the room.

====Subsequent uses====
Most of the rest of the block bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Sixth Street, Mariposa Avenue and Alexandria Avenue was occupied by the Chapman Park Hotel and Bungalows which wanted to acquire the rest of the block that it did not own, including the lot that the original Derby had occupied. After the restaurant moved out in May 1936, the building was demolished and the hotel was expanded and occupied by October of the same year. The hotel itself was replaced in 1967 by the Equitable Life Building.

===Replacement Wilshire building===
In 1936, a larger building, also in the shape of a hat, was constructed at 3377 Wilshire Boulevard at the northeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Alexandria Avenue, about a block from its previous location (and directly across the street from the Ambassador Hotel). The restaurant was able to move into its new home in May of that year.

In 1947&#x27;s &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;, the &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; segment ends with Willie the Giant&#x27;s stomping through Hollywood looking for Mickey Mouse. Before the scene closes, Willie notices The Brown Derby restaurant and picks up the restaurant looking for Mickey. Willie notices the restaurant looks like a hat, places it on his head, and stomps off with the lights of the Hollywood Sign blinking in the background.

The Wilshire Brown Derby was frequented by director Ed Wood and his entourage, including the psychic the Amazing Criswell and Criswell&#x27;s wife Halo Meadows.

In September 1980, the restaurant closed without warning. Local preservationists worked to stop the building from being bulldozed, and convinced developers to remove and restore the derby hat portion of the building. The rest of the restaurant building was demolished and replaced with a shopping center. The derby-shaped structure was placed on the roof of the new building.

====Subsequent uses====
The parking lot was replaced in late 1985 by a shopping center known as the Brown Derby Plaza. The domed structure was incorporated into the third floor of the building, and is currently vacant; it formerly accommodated a Korean bar.

== Hollywood Brown Derby ==
Despite its less distinctive Spanish Mission style facade, the second Brown Derby, which opened on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1929 at 1628 North Vine Street in Hollywood, was the branch that played the greater part in Hollywood history. Due to its proximity to movie studios, it became the place to do deals and be seen.

In the first of the Hollywood episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (&quot;L.A. at Last&quot;), Lucy (Lucille Ball), Ethel (Vivian Vance), and Fred (William Frawley) have lunch at the Brown Derby. During the misadventure, the trio dine in a booth with Eve Arden on one side and William Holden on the other. This leads to the disaster scene in which Lucy inadvertently causes a waiter to hit Holden in the face with a pie.

Like its Wilshire Boulevard counterpart, the Hollywood Brown Derby had a celebrity wall with hundreds of celebrity drawings, paintings and caricatures. Jack Lane drew many of the caricatures between 1947 and 1985. Another artist whose work was displayed was Nicholas Volpe. He was commissioned by the Brown Derby to paint portraits of up to 200 top recording artists to be displayed in the restaurant&#x27;s Hall of Fame Record Room. In addition, his Oscar-winning star portraits were displayed in the restaurant&#x27;s &quot;Academy Room,&quot; created for showing Volpe&#x27;s art.

The Hollywood Brown Derby is the purported birthplace of the Cobb salad, which was said to have been hastily arranged from leftovers by owner Bob Cobb for showman and theater owner Sid Grauman. It was chopped fine, because Grauman had just had dental work done, and couldn&#x27;t chew well.

According to Shirley Temple, the non-alcoholic drink bearing her name was invented at the Brown Derby in the mid-1930s. Temple herself never liked the drink and noted her personality rights had been used without permission.

In 1984, the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the Hollywood Brown Derby building and an unnamed compatible building to its north (at 1632 Vine St.) listed as a contributing properties in the district. Aspects of the Brown Derby noted in the register include its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, Churrigueresque detailing, arched entrance, wrought iron decorations, red tile roof, and its overall &quot;extraordinary attention to detail,&quot; while aspects of the compatible building include its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, false gable focal point, and Churrigueresque ornament. 

The Hollywood Brown Derby closed for the last time at its original site on April 3, 1985, as a result of a lease dispute. The building was later occupied Arbat Continental Restaurant, when, in 1987, an early morning fire destroyed the kitchen. After the fire, the building deteriorated further as it remained unoccupied and suffered frequent break-ins from squatters and gang members. As a result of damage caused by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the building at 1628 North Vine Street was declared unsafe by the City of Los Angeles and was the first building in Hollywood ordered to be demolished. It was razed the following month.

===Subsequent uses===
The remainder of the Hollywood Brown Derby building then became home to Premieres of Hollywood, which catered to the revitalization of Hollywood Boulevard and the style of &quot;Old Hollywood&quot;. Premieres of Hollywood offered an eclectic mix of American cuisine along with the original Cobb Salad (the recipe was found in the kitchen during the renovation). Premieres of Hollywood was destroyed during the L.A. riots in 1992. 

The land is now occupied by an apartment complex.

===Later Brown Derby restaurants===

After the original Hollywood Brown Derby at 1628 North Vine Street closed in April 1985 a spokesman for Walter P. Scharfe, who had purchased the chain a decade earlier, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the restaurant owner was “99% committed” to reopening the business at a new location. Late in 1986 Scharfe opened a new Brown Derby in the Lieberg Building at 911 E. Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. The new restaurant would utilize the dark booths, crystal chandeliers, and 1500 caricatures removed from the original location. Scharfe opened another Brown Derby at 1707 N. Vine Street in Hollywood in October 1987. The location had most recently been a Howard Johnson&#x27;s coffee shop and reopened as a more casual version of the famous eatery with a large painted derby hat gracing the exterior walls. In 1987 Scharfe told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that he had plans to open additional Brown Derby restaurants in Palm Springs, Honolulu, and Vancouver. Both restaurants closed after a short time. In 1994 Scharfe opened another Brown Derby at the Beverly Center shopping mall. The small location featured miniature replicas of the famous caricatures and closed in less than one year.

== Beverly Hills Brown Derby ==

Bob Cobb opened the third Brown Derby in 1931 at 9537 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, across from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The building had previously housed a women&#x27;s clothing store called &quot;The Petite Shop.&quot; One of the dining areas was called The American Room and featured charcoal portraits of Academy Award-winning actors by artist Nicholas Volpe on the walls. The Beverly Hills Brown Derby featured a revolving door (the first in Beverly Hills) and a uniformed doorman. A 1938 expansion with a bar and private dining room was called &quot;The Derby House&quot; and was decorated in Old English style. It was closed in 1982 and demolished shortly afterwards. Developer Douglas Stitzel purchased the vacant property in 1986 to build the &quot;One Rodeo&quot; shopping development.

== Los Feliz Brown Derby ==
The building that formerly housed the Los Feliz Brown Derby at 4500 Los Feliz Boulevard has been in use as a restaurant since the 1920s. Film mogul Cecil B. DeMille, a part owner of the Wilshire Blvd. restaurant, bought the building, a former chicken restaurant named Willard&#x27;s, and converted it into a Brown Derby in 1940. It uniquely combined a formal restaurant with a dramatic domed ceiling with a more casual drive-in cafe outside. 

===Subsequent uses===
In 1960, it was purchased by actor Michael St. Angel (aka Steve Flagg) and became Michaels of Los Feliz, and in 1992 it was transformed by new owners Tony and Tammi Gower into a nightclub known as The Derby. In the late 1990s, it became one of the centers of the resurgence of swing dancing, which launched the careers of modern swing bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Johnny Crawford. Oregon rock/swing/ska band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies recorded a song that cites the venue, titled &quot;Brown Derby Jump&quot;, on their album &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;.

The Derby was prominently featured in the 1996 film &quot;Swingers&quot;, in the scene where Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn&#x27;s characters bypass the line at the front door, enter through the service entrance, walk through the kitchen, and into the club where Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are playing on the stage, in an ode to the classic restaurant scene with Ray Liotta in Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.
In June 2004, when Hillhurst/Los Feliz LLC purchased The Derby and adjacent lots with a view to demolition and replacement by a condominium complex, the planned redevelopment became a cause célèbre for historic preservation activists. An independent coalition called &quot;Save The Derby&quot; fought to prevent the demolition, and, on May 19, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to designate the entire structure an official Historic Cultural Monument of the City of Los Angeles.

In January 2009, the nightclub closed its doors. The current landlord chose not to renew the lease, not long after a shooting inside the club. In 2012, the Los Feliz Brown Derby space is occupied by the gastropub &quot;Mess Hall Kitchen&quot; and a Chase bank, dividing the dome in half between the businesses. The interior framing details of the dome construction have been exposed and are now visible from inside the restaurant.
== Brown Derby Crenshaw Center ==
A fifth Brown Derby opened in 1955 at the Broadway Crenshaw Shopping Center, now known as the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, in the Baldwin Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. It was a 24-hour coffee shop designed by architect Rowland Crawford and located near the center&#x27;s Desmond&#x27;s men&#x27;s store The address was 3625 Stocker Avenue, Los Angeles, California. The location later became an early location of The International House of Pancakes

==Licensing program==
The Brown Derby began a licensing program in 1987, with an agreement with The Walt Disney Company for a replica of the original Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant at the new Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. In 1990, the Walt Disney Company entered into three additional agreements for the Walt Disney Movie Studios at Disneyland Resort Paris, Tokyo Disney Sea at Tokyo Disney Resort and Disney California Adventure Park at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. In 1996, a ten-year agreement was entered into with MGM Grand Las Vegas Las Vegas, Nevada; in 1998, the MGM Grand Detroit, Michigan temporary facility was added.

<doc id="791689" wikidata="Q717361" url="?curid=791689" title="Genesis Climber MOSPEADA">
<text>(literally &quot;Armored Genesis MOSPEADA&quot;) is an anime science fiction series created by Shinji Aramaki and Hideki Kakinuma. The 25-episode television series ran from late 1983 to early 1984 in Japan. MOSPEADA is an acronym of &quot;Military Operation Soldier Protection Emergency Aviation Dive Armor&quot;, one of the transformable motorcycle-armors the series features. The other primary mecha featured in the show is the three-form transformable fighter called the Armo-Fighter AFC-01 Legioss. &quot;MOSPEADA&quot; was adapted as the third generation of the American series &quot;Robotech&quot;, much like &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

==Story==
In the 21st century, Earth&#x27;s pollution problems result in the development of a new hydrogen fuel called &quot;HBT&quot; as an alternative to fossil fuels, while mankind colonizes Mars. In 2050, a mysterious alien race called the Invid invades Earth, the ensuing war leaves only a few pockets of human resistance on the planet&#x27;s surface. Many of the refugees escape aboard a few remaining shuttles to seek shelter on the Moon. The Invid set up their main base of operations on Earth, called &quot;Reflex Point&quot;, in the Great Lakes area of North America.

However, the Mars colony, dubbed the Mars Base, does not forget about the plight of Earth. Troops are sent in to fight the Invid from the Moon, only to fail miserably. The Invid do not attack Mars and show no interest towards the other planets. Surprisingly, the aliens show no hostility towards humans unless they are directly provoked. The Invid can also sense the presence of HBT and use of the fuel is limited under their supervision, as HBT is a common component in weapons technology. Mars Base becomes a gigantic military factory, producing vast amounts of advanced weaponry and trained troops. In 2080, Mars Base sends an expeditionary force to liberate the planet from the Invid - but it is virtually destroyed despite a technological advantage including the deployment of transformable mecha.

A Second Expeditionary Force is dispatched three years but destroyed in a ferocious battle in orbit around the Earth, Legioss pilot Stik Barnard turns out to be the only survivor as he crashlands in South America, but his fiancée, Marlene, is killed in the chaos. A holographic recording of Marlene given to Stik just before the operation began gives him the strength to move on and avenge her death. In his quest to reach Reflex Point, he meets the other main characters of the show, forming a group of ragtag freedom fighters in a quest to rid the planet of the Invid.

As the plot unfolds, the purpose of the Invid invasion is revealed: to find a suitable place to evolve into more complex beings. However, the Invid do not know that their endeavor actually threatens to cause the extinction of both humans and Invid and thus, it is up to Stik and his group, with the help of humanoid Invid (Aisha and Solzie), to convince Invid&#x27;s hive queen, the Refless, to flee from Earth.

==Characters==
The &quot;Robotech&quot;-adapted names are in brackets: [ ].

* [Scott Bernard] (Bin Shimada): A 20-year-old Mars Base lieutenant who becomes stranded on Earth as the Invid obliterate the defenses of the Second Earth Recapture Force. As a result of the overwhelming force of the Invid, Stik&#x27;s fiancée, , is killed when her ship attempts to land on the planet surface, leaving Stik angry and bitter. Even after he gathers his freedom fighters together, he often allows his hatred towards the Invid to distract him from the responsible decision-making his friends know he is capable of. In the end, however, he finds his peace again as he becomes aware of his growing feelings for Aisha, despite her Invid background.
* [Rand] (Hisao Ōyama): A 17-year-old scavenger who plays the role of the historian, optimist, and wisecracker of the group. Originally, Ray was a loner who actually enjoyed teasing the Inbit as they chased him around the territory, but he joins Stik in order to deal a serious blow to the invaders. Extremely resourceful and with a good intuition, Ray is the first in the group who gradually manages to figure out important clues about the Invid&#x27;s true nature. He is a huge fan of Yellow Belmont until he learns that the female singer is actually a man. Over the course of the series, he develops deep feelings for Houquet, but she is slow to warm up to his affections.
* [Annie &quot;Mint&quot; La Belle] (Sanae Miyuki (credited as Miyuki Muroi)): A spirited and precocious 13-year-old girl who was abandoned by her parents. She tags along with the group in order to find a husband, but ends up becoming part of the team. Often considered an annoyance to the rest of the group, Mint is nonetheless loved by her fellow freedom fighters, and proves herself valuable to the mission on several occasions. Her trademark attire is the E.T. cap that she wears. It is not known whether the E.T. stands for the science fantasy movie of the same name or something else.
* [Rook Bartley] (Mika Doi): A 16-year-old former motorcycle gang member and girlfriend to gang leader, Romy. She was severely beaten and taken advantage of by a rival gang when they cornered her away from her group. Houquet initially fights for the helpless and refuses an alliance with Stik, but joins the team after realizing that she would be stronger with them than without them. Eventually she comes to respect her companions enough that she offers to sacrifice herself in order to save the others. She eventually falls in love with Ray, but for most of the series is unable to open her heart and express her feelings to him.
* [Jim &quot;Lunk&quot; Austin] (Tomomichi Nishimura): A 32-year-old maintenance mechanic. Jim was once a member of the Mars Base forces, but deserted after failing to save a friend from the Invid. Though he labeled himself a coward and often sees himself as a liability to Stik&#x27;s team, the team is quick to object to this, noting Jim&#x27;s courage and dependability during their repeated encounters with Invid forces.
* Lance &quot;Lancer&quot; Belmont] (Mine Matsuki)/(Hirotaka Suzuoki): A 22-year-old soldier from the Second Expeditionary Force. He poses as both a male soldier and as a female singer, in order to hide from the Inbit and certain locals. Yellow has made quite a name for himself as an entertainer, but upon meeting Stik and his friends, Yellow decides to help free Earth from the Invid. His ability to completely change both his physical appearance and personality adds to the team&#x27;s ability to infiltrate towns and cities in order to gather supplies or complete missions. His stage name in &quot;Robotech&quot; was Yellow Dancer.
* Ariel/Marlene] (Miki Takahashi): A female Invid changed into humanoid form as part of an experiment to adapt the Invid to Terran conditions. (In &quot;Robotech&quot;, she was given the name Marlene after Scott (Stik)&#x27;s late fiancée. When they first meet her, she has amnesia and is unable to tell the group her real name. She gradually develops human emotions and sympathies, and ends up falling in love with Stik.
* [Regess] (Noriko Ohara): The Invid&#x27;s hive queen is seeking to terraform the Earth to make it suitable for Invid colonization. She is presented as a non-corporeal alien intelligence who condemns human beings for being genetically and socially inferior.
* [Sera] (Waka Kanda): Another female Invid transformed into humanoid form. Accidentally encounters Yellow as he is bathing in a waterfall, and the encounter leaves her resolve shaken as she slowly begins to fall in love with him. Eventually, she becomes the first Invid to independently sympathize with the human cause.
* [Corg] (Hōchū Ōtsuka): The sole male Invid in the series changed into humanoid form. Unlike Aisha and Solzie, Battlar&#x27;s experiences with Stik&#x27;s team leaves him angry and insulted. His repeated defeat in combat by Stik causes Battlar to make his mission of stopping Stik&#x27;s group a personal vendetta.

The English-subtitled &quot;MOSPEADA&quot; DVD released by Harmony Gold and ADV Films uses the inaccurate names (such as &quot;Mint Rubble&quot;, &quot;Houquet Emrose&quot;, and &quot;Jim Auston&quot;) derived from fans on Robotech.com and the &quot;Robotech Art I&quot; book.

==Episode list==
==Music==
;Opening theme:
**Composed by Yukihide Takekawa; lyric by Masao Urino; arranged by Joe Hisaishi
**Vocals: Andy Koyama
;Ending theme:
**Composed by Yukihide Takekawa; lyric by Masao Urino; arranged by Joe Hisaishi
**Vocals: Andy Koyama and Mine Matsuki

The incidental music was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who would later gain renown for incidental music for the movies of Hayao Miyazaki, though it is accidentally credited, because of a misreading of the name characters, to a &quot;Yuzuru Hisaishi.&quot; MOSPEADA is the first anime series to have a jazz-based theme song (Blue Rain).

Malaysian indie rock band Hujan made their own cover of the opening song titled &quot;Lonely Soldier Boy&quot; (derived from one of the lyrics&#x27; English lines) where the lyrics are entirely translated from Japanese into Malay, except for the English lines which are left intact. The song was included in the band&#x27;s album, also named after the song.

==Production==
The original working titles for MOSPEADA were: &quot;Kouka Kihei Vector&quot; (&quot;Descent Machine Soldier Vector&quot;), &quot;Chou Fumetsu Yousai Reflex Point&quot; (&quot;Super Immortal Fortress Reflex Point&quot;) and &quot;AD Patrol&quot;: the story of city police where the main character rides a transformable bike that changes into his partner. The main character designs were created by Yoshitaka Amano, who would later gain renown for his character artwork for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

Each of the Japanese episode titles contains a musical reference. This style of titling would later be used by &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;.

Mechanical designer Shinji Aramaki came up with the transformable motorcycle-powered exoskeleton design while working on the &quot;Diaclone&quot; series (which later became part of &quot;Transformers&quot;). When riding his Honda VT250 250 cc motorbike, he thought to himself that it was the right size for a person to wear. Aramaki mentioned that the idea came to him because of his love for riding motorcycles when he was young.

The bike design was inspired by the Suzuki Katana. The black and white stripes on the Legioss and VR ride armor are a tribute to the Allied invasion stripes in World War II.

The series was released in North America by ADV Films with the original Japanese language and English subtitles on June 17, 2003. 

Crunchyroll licenses the series.

==Adaptation for the &quot;Robotech&quot; series==
Most of &quot;MOSPEADA&quot;″s animation (with edited content and revised dialogue) was adapted for American audiences as &quot;Robotech: The New Generation&quot;, the third saga of the &quot;Robotech&quot; compilation series. In &quot;Robotech&quot;, the Inbit became the &quot;Invid&quot; of the &quot;Third Generation&quot; (also featured in &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot;) and the advanced space forces are the returning &quot;Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF)&quot; that left before the &quot;Second Generation&quot; of Robotech on Earth. Earth&#x27;s Defense Forces were decimated in the previous saga. Unlike the Invid in the adapted &quot;Robotech&quot;, the Inbit in &quot;MOSPEADA&quot; had nothing to do with the Robotech Masters (their sworn enemies in &quot;Robotech&quot;) and they were just looking for a good planet on which to evolve and reach perfection. Likewise, the REF forces under Admiral Hunter&#x27;s command that Barnard frequently referred to were troops from the Mars and Jupiter bases which harassed the Invid, though they were playing a &quot;leave alone&quot; system with humans on Earth.

The show&#x27;s transformable mecha were also renamed; the Armor Cycles as Veritech Cyclones motorcycles; the AFC-01 Legioss became the VF/A-6 Alpha Veritech; the AB-01 Tlead became the VFB-9 Beta Veritech. Like &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot;, &quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA&quot; was cut and fitted to be part of the &quot;Robotech&quot; continuum by Harmony Gold and Carl Macek.

Character names were generally altered without major changes in characterization, making &quot;MOSPEADA&quot; the least altered series of the three. Incidentally, it is also the series that has seen the most usage in the expanded universe of &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot; and &quot;&quot;, especially in terms of character, mecha, and ship designs, as it was chronologically the &quot;last&quot; series used in Robotech. Unlike &quot;Macross&quot;, which is owned by Big West, Harmony Gold is free to utilize elements from the Tatsunoko-owned &quot;MOSPEADA&quot;.

===&quot;Love Live Alive&quot;===
After the original run of the television series, an OVA music video titled &quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA: Love Live Alive&quot; was released in Japan in September 1985. The music video consisted of both old and new footage. The story of &quot;Love Live Alive&quot; chronicled the events after the ending of &quot;MOSPEADA&quot;, featuring Yellow Belmont as the main character.

The music video focused on Yellow&#x27;s concert and his flashbacks of past events. In 2013, it was adapted by Harmony Gold into &quot;&quot;. Some DVD releases of the &quot;Robotech&quot; version of &quot;Love Live Alive&quot; also include the original Japanese version as bonus content.
