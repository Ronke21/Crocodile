<doc id="762921" wikidata="Q4571443" url="?curid=762921" title="1964 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1964 Atlantic hurricane season featured the highest number of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was above average, with thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June 2, almost two weeks before the official start of the season. Striking Florida on June 6, the storm brought localized flooding to portions of Cuba and the Southeastern United States, leaving about $1 million in damage. The next storm, also unnamed, developed near the end of July; it did not impact land.

The effects of Hurricanes Cleo, Dora, and Isbell combined were devastating to Florida. Cleo also brought destruction to portions of the Caribbean, especially Guadeloupe and Haiti. After moving inland, Cleo brought flooding to states such as Virginia. Overall, the storm caused 220 deaths and about $198.5 million in damage. Dora lashed much of North Florida and southeastern Georgia with hurricane-force winds, leaving five fatalities and around $280 million in damage. In October, Isbell brought strong winds and several tornadoes to Florida, as well as flooding to Cuba and The Carolinas. Isbell killed seven people and left approximately $30 million in damage.

The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Cleo, a powerful Category 4 hurricane that severely affected areas in the Caribbean, including the Leeward Islands, Haiti, and Cuba. Cleo went on to hit the United States, in the eastern Florida peninsula as a minimal Category 2 hurricane, particularly in Miami, Florida, where the storm brought severe damage to the state alone, and bringing heavy rain, and severe flooding to the Carolinas in the United States East Coast as a tropical storm. The names Cleo, Dora, and Hilda were retired following the season. Collectively, the tropical cyclones resulted in 271 fatalities and approximately $640.63 million in damage.

== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1964. It was a slightly above average season in which thirteen tropical storms formed, compared with the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Seven of these reached hurricane status, which is slightly higher than the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Five of the seven hurricanes reached major hurricane status – Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale – above the 1950–2000 mean of 2.3 per season. Prior to the season, National Hurricane Center director Gordon Dunn noted that the probability of a hurricane striking the United States was &quot;astronomical.&quot; The tropical cyclones of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season collectively caused at least 271 deaths and about $640.63 million in damage. The season officially ended on November 30, 1964.

The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June 2. It struck Florida as a tropical depression and then strengthened into a tropical storm while out at sea. The storm ceased to exist on June 11. Thereafter, the season went dormant for nearly seven weeks, as the next cyclone, another unnamed storm, did not form until July 23. This would be followed by the development of a third unnamed system on July 28. Tropical cyclogenesis increased in August, which had four tropical cyclones, Abby, Brenda, Cleo, and Dora. The strongest storm of the season, Cleo, peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Four additional storms originated in September, including Ethel, Florence, Gladys, and Hilda. Hurricane Isbell was the sole tropical cyclone to form in the month of October. The final system, another unnamed storm, existed developed on November 5 and dissipated on November 10.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 153. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==

=== Unnamed June tropical storm ===

A disturbance that moved out of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) developed into a tropical depression to the east of British Honduras (modern day Belize) on June 2. Moving slowly northward to north-northeastward across the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, the depression failed to intensify significantly. Shortly after 12:00 UTC on June 6, it made landfall just south of Cedar Key, Florida, with winds of . Early the following day, the depression emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Jacksonville and began to strengthen and move northeastward. While located offshore South Carolina on June 7, the system became a tropical storm. Further deepening occurred slowly, with the storm peaking with winds of late on June 9. By June 11, it was absorbed by an extratropical low while located about south-southeast of Sable Island in Nova Scotia.

The storm brought local flooding to portions of western Cuba and the Southeastern United States. Some areas in North Florida experienced considerable damage from strong winds and hail associated with thunderstorm, particularly in Cross City. Damage in the Jacksonville area alone was over $300,000. A few gale warnings were issued between Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Nags Head, North Carolina. More than of rain in the former resulted in inundated streets and overflowing streams. Additionally, about of water covered streets in downtown Conway, South Carolina. Overall, the storm caused about $1 million in damage.
=== Unnamed July tropical storm ===

A low-pressure area formed near Columbia, South Carolina, early on July 23 and became a tropical depression. Due to its association with a mid to upper-level trough through July 25, the depression may have been a subtropical cyclone, though such a classification could not be confirmed prior to when satellite imagery became routine. The depression moved east-northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, early on July 24. Several hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Based on ship data and baroclinic intensification, the storm likely peaked with maximum sustained winds of just before becoming extratropical about of Nantucket, Massachusetts, around 12:00 UTC on July 26. The extratropical remnants moved northeastward towards Atlantic Canada, until another extratropical cyclone absorbed it near the south coast of Newfoundland late on July 27.
=== Unnamed July hurricane ===

Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) indicated an area of disturbed weather with a weak surface circulation in the vicinity of Cape Verde on July 25. Reports from a reconnaissance aircraft indicate that a tropical depression developed at 06:00 UTC on July 28, while located about halfway between the Leeward Islands and the northernmost islands of Cape Verde. Initially the depression moved rapidly west-northwestward, which likely caused the minimal intensification. By July 30, a north-northwest to south-southeast oriented trough forced the depression to re-curve north-northwestward.

While situated about east of Bermuda on July 31, it began heading northeastward. Later that day, the depression finally organized further and developed a well-defined rainband. The Atlantic hurricane database indicates that the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on July 31, due to ships reports of winds reaching . On August 1, it intensified further into a hurricane. Around that time, maximum sustained winds peaked at . The storm continued moving rapidly northeastward and began to interact with a cold front. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 2, while located about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland.
=== Tropical Storm Abby ===
A weak trough developed into a tropical depression late on August 5 while located about south of Dauphin Island, Alabama. The depression moved westward and initially remained disorganized. At 12:00 UTC on August 7, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Abby. It was a small tropical cyclone, spanning a diameter of less than . The storm quickly intensified further late on August 7. A few hours later, Abby made landfall near Matagorda, Texas, at just below hurricane intensity. Abby may have reached hurricane status, but the lack of definitive observations prevented an upgrade. It weakened to a tropical depression early on August 8, before dissipating later that day.

Overall, impact from this system was minor. In Texas, precipitation peaked at at the Victoria Regional Airport. However, only localized flooding occurred and rainfall was mostly beneficial. In the city of Victoria, several streets were temporarily inundated with water. A fishing company in Matagorda lost a portion of its roof. Abby resulted in an estimated $750,000 in losses, with $150,000 in damage to property and $600,000 to crops. The impacts from the storm were most severe in Jackson and Victoria counties, where damage to crops were estimated at $275,000 and $250,000, respectively.
=== Tropical Storm Brenda ===

A minor trough of low pressure was situated west of Bermuda in early August. An airline crew member observed a low-level circular cloud forming at 32.0°N, 69.0°W at 18:00 UTC on August 7. Early on August 8, a tropical depression developed about northwest of Bermuda. It moved east-southeastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Brenda six hours later. At 13:00 UTC on August 8, the cyclone struck Bermuda with winds of . The island experienced sustained winds up to and gusts up to . A tornado damaged several aircraft, most of which were privately owned. Damage reached approximately $275,000.

Shortly after moving across Bermuda on August 8, spiral bands appeared on the island&#x27;s radar. Advisories on Brenda were not initiated until 18:00 UTC on August 8, due to sparsity of data, making it difficult to confirm the existence of a tropical cyclone. A cold front caused the storm to re-curve northeastward on August 9. Brenda then began weakening and dissipated late on the following day, while located about east-northeast of Bermuda.
=== Hurricane Cleo ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Storm Cleo while located about east of Barbados late on August 20. It continued west-northwestward, quickly intensifying into a hurricane later on August 21. Cleo rapidly deepened and reached Category 3 early on August 22. Several hours later, Cleo struck Marie-Galante and the main island of Guadeloupe with winds of . The storm then intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and entered the Caribbean Sea. While located south of the Dominican Republic around 18:00 UTC on August 23, Cleo attained its peak intensity with winds of . The hurricane then made landfall near Les Cayes, Haiti, on August 25 at the same intensity. The storm re-emerged into the Caribbean hours later as a Category 2 hurricane but weakened to Category 1 intensity around 12:00 UTC. Cleo briefly moved ashore near Cape Cruz, Cuba, with winds of .

The cyclone emerged into the Gulf of Guacanayabo, before striking Sancti Spíritus Province as a minimal hurricane early on August 26. Cleo briefly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging into the Atlantic and re-strengthening, becoming a hurricane again at 18:00 UTC. Now moving north-northwestward, the system reached Category 2 intensity early on August 27, hours before striking Miami Beach, Florida, with winds of . The system quickly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm intensity near Port St. Lucie later that day. Cleo briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic off the coast of North Florida, before making another landfall on St. Simons Island, Georgia, early on August 29 with winds of . Cleo weakened to a tropical depression over South Carolina on August 30 but did not dissipate. Thereafter, the cyclone curved northeastward and eventually eastward while crossing the Carolinas and Virginia. Cleo re-intensified into a tropical storm while re-entering the Atlantic near Norfolk, Virginia, on September 1. It moved east-northeastward and became a hurricane again about 24 hours later. Late on September 3, Cleo became a Category 2 hurricane again. The cyclone then to the northeast and lost tropical characteristics, becoming extratropical to the southeast of Newfoundland on September 4. The remnants meandered in the Atlantic until dissipating about halfway between southern Greenland and Ireland on September 10.

In Guadeloupe, the storm destroyed 1,000 homes and caused extensive damage to roofs, roads, and power lines. Additionally, the banana crop was ruined. Overall, there were 14 deaths and about $50 million in damage. Cleo caused seven fatalities and at least $2 million in damage in Dominican Republic. Strong winds in Haiti caused severe damage. On Île-à-Vache, 50 houses either had the roof caved in or the walls knocked over. In Les Cayes, 70% of houses were destroyed, as was the sugar mill. In rural areas outside of the city, 90% to 95% of dwellings were demolished. About half of the houses in Camp-Perrin were leveled. Near Saint-Louis-du-Sud, many sugarcane crops, particularly on the west side of the city, were ruined. The storm left 192 fatalities and $5 million in damage in Haiti. Impact in Cuba was minor, with one death and $2 million in damage. In Florida, Cleo left damage along much of the east coast. Winds left about 620,000 people without electricity in South Florida alone. Throughout the state, the storm damaged almost 19,000 homes and destroyed 4 others, while 2,187 mobile homes were flattened or suffered severe impact. Additionally, 605 small businesses were damaged or destroyed. There were three deaths in Broward County and about $125 million in damage, including agriculture. Cleo brought flooding to a few other states, especially Virginia. In the Hampton Roads area, many streets were inundated and blocked. Hundreds of dwellings were flooded, forcing several areas to evacuate. Three deaths and about $3 million in damage occurred in Virginia. Overall, the storm caused 220 fatalities and about $198.5 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Dora ===
A tropical depression developed from a low-pressure area on August 28, shortly after moving offshore the west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dora at 18:00 UTC on August 31. It then curved northeastward and continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane status about 48 hours later. Intensification slowed somewhat, though Dora became a Category 3 major hurricane on September 5. Deepening further, the storm became a Category 4 for six hours early on September 6 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of early the following day. Dora then remained a Category 3 hurricane until early the next day, when it weakened to Category 2 hurricane while curving westward.

Approaching the east coast of Florida, Dora briefly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 9, before reaching Category 2 status several hours later. Dora&#x27;s motion then became erratic, making a few very small cyclonic loops. Around 04:00 UTC on September 10, the hurricane made landfall near St. Augustine, Florida, with winds of . Dora initially weakened quickly after moving inland, falling to tropical storm status within 14 hours of landfall. Dora then briefly drifted over southwestern Georgia, until turning east-northeastward late on September 11. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over South Carolina around 12:00 UTC on September 13. The remnants emerged into the Atlantic near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and continued northeastward, striking Newfoundland on September 15, shortly before being absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone.

Dora was the only hurricane in the twentieth century to make landfall in the First Coast region of Florida. Along the coast, tides reached up to above mean sea level. Sustained hurricane-force winds were reported from Flagler County to far southeastern Georgia. In Jacksonville, Florida, approximately 156,000 customers were left without electricity, while about 19% of phones in Duval County were out of service. Much of the damage in the Jacksonville area occurred to older buildings and those located in coastal areas. Additionally, sections of the city experienced wind-induced river flooding in the vicinity of the St. Johns River. Three homes were destroyed and 3,992 suffered damage, while 5 mobile homes were demolished and 25 experienced impact, overall in Duval County. Heavy rainfall damaged many unharvested crops and inundated numerous of roads and bridges, isolated some communities for several days. Throughout Florida, 74 dwellings were flattened and 9,374 received damage, while 14 mobile homes were destroyed and 218 others suffered severe impact. About 50 farm buildings and 423 small businesses were severely damaged or demolished. Three deaths and at least $230 million in damage occurred. In Georgia, the storm damaged about 1,135 homes and obliterated five others. Additionally, 18 trailers suffered major impact, while 43 small businesses were destroyed or experienced severe damage. There was one death in the state and at least $9 million in damage. A few other states were affected by the storm, though impact there was much lesser. One death occurred in Virginia. Overall, Dora caused $280 million in damage and five deaths.
=== Hurricane Ethel ===

TIROS observed a large cloud mass near 18°N, 37°W on September 4. It developed into a tropical depression early that day while located about east of Cape Verde. The depression moved west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Ethel at 18:00 UTC on September 4. Initially, it was suggested that Hurricane Dora could absorb Ethel, as the storms were located apart. On September 7, Ethel strengthened into a hurricane. By early on the following day, it curved westward and continued to slowly deepen, before turning to the north-northwestward on September 11.

By late on September 12, the storm curved northeastward and passed to the northeast of Bermuda early the next day, bringing of precipitation and wind gusts up to . Throughout the island, low-lying areas were flooded and trees were felled. At St. George&#x27;s Island, residents were briefly left without electricity and telephones and the causeway linking St. George&#x27;s Island to the main island was inundated. Early on September 13, Ethel intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and soon peaked with winds of . The system became extratropical late on September 14, while located about southeast of Cape Race. Newfoundland. The extratropical remnants slowly weakened while meandering around the Atlantic, until dissipating just north of the Azores on September 17. 
=== Tropical Storm Florence ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 5. The wave quickly developed into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on September 5, while located about west of Dakar, Senegal. Shortly later, the depression produced squally weather in Cape Verde. The depression then re-curved northwestward and began to intensify. At 00:00 UTC on September 7, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence. About twenty four hours later, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of . Florence then curved north-northeastward later that day and slowly weakened. A reconnaissance aircraft reported that Florence degenerated into an area of squalls to the south of the Azores at 06:00 UTC on September 10.
=== Hurricane Gladys ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 8. Tracking westward, it developed into Tropical Storm Gladys while centered about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde early on September 13. The storm moved northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on September 14, before weakened back to a tropical storm early the next day. Gladys re-strengthened into a hurricane on September 16. By the next day, the cyclone quickly intensified, briefly peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 18:00 UTC. Gladys weakened to a Category 3 early on September 18. Gladys weakened to a Category 2 as it re-curved northward on September 20.

The storm weakened to a Category 1 as it turned northwestward on September 22 and briefly threatened the East Coast of the United States. However, it veered northeastward on September 23 and moved rapidly toward Atlantic Canada. By 00:00 UTC on September 25, Gladys became extratropical just offshore Newfoundland and promptly dissipated. Along the East Coast of the United States, Gladys produced light rainfall, gusty winds, and storm surge. Coastal flooding was reported in North Carolina and Virginia. In the former, high tides inundated homes and buildings with of water in two small villages on the Outer Banks and flooded a highway to Manteo. In the state of Virginia, one death occurred when a man was fatally struck in the throat by debris. Abnormally high tides also affected the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Atlantic Canada, with tides ranging from higher than average in Virginia.
=== Hurricane Hilda ===

A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on September 28, while located about south of Trinidad, Cuba. The depression tracked west-northwestward and struck Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, early on September 29. After briefly re-emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Hilda at 11:00 UTC on September 29 while making landfall near Sandino, Cuba. By late on September 29, it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Cape San Antonio. The storm continued to intensify, reaching hurricane status on September 30. During the following 30 hours, Hilda strengthened significantly and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of late on October 1. It re-curved northward and began weakening due to unfavorable conditions. Around 23:00 UTC on October 3, the storm made landfall near Franklin, Louisiana, as a Category 2 with winds of . It rapidly weakened inland and became extratropical over southern Mississippi by 12:00 UTC that day. The remnant extratropical low continued eastward and emerged into the Atlantic late on October 5, before dissipating well north of the Bahamas on October 7.

In Cuba, the storm caused minor impact, with damage totaling about $1 million. Offshore the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, 13 oil platforms were destroyed and 5 others were damaged beyond repair. Losses to the oil industry reached $100 million. In Louisiana, sustained winds of 90 to 105 mph to (150 to 165 km/h) lashed the Abbeville-Morgan City-New Iberia area. Additionally, several tornadoes in the New Orleans area resulted in significant damage. One tornado near Larose killed 22 people despite being on the ground for only . There were 37 fatalities and an estimated 5,000 injuries. Approximately 19,000 homes were damaged in the state, 2,600 of which were severely impacted. Outside of Louisiana, damage was primarily caused by flooding in the Southeastern United States. Impacted worst by flooding was North Carolina, where 2,000 homes and buildings suffered water damage and one death was reported. Throughout the United States, the storm caused 38 fatalities and $125 million in losses.
=== Hurricane Isbell ===

A diffused frontal trough developed into a tropical depression in the western Caribbean on October 9. The depression initially remained disorganized as it track northwestward, but strengthened into Tropical Storm Isbell at 12:00 UTC on October 11. Re-curving northeastward, Isbell quickly strengthened further and reached hurricane status about 24 hour alter. The storm briefly became a Category 2 just before making landfall in Sandino, Cuba, with winds of at 19:00 UTC on October 13. Isbell briefly weakened to a Category 1, but strengthened into a Category 3 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of at 12:00 UTC on October 14. The cyclone weakened to a Category 2 prior to making landfall near Everglades City, Florida, with winds of . Early on October 15, Isbell weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and then emerged into the Atlantic near Jupiter, Florida. Isbell curved northwestward on October 16, weakening to a tropical storm just before making landfall in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, with winds of . The storm quickly became extratropical and was soon absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over North Carolina late on October 16.

The storm produced strong winds throughout western Cuba. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, as were several tobacco warehouses. There were four deaths in Cuba, three of them caused by collapsing houses in the Guane area. Isbell was responsible for three deaths and approximately $10 million in damage in Cuba. Several tornadoes in Florida caused significant damage overall. Throughout the state, 1 house was destroyed, 33 others were severely damage, and 631 others suffered minor impact. Additionally, 66 trailers were destroyed and 88 were inflicted with major damage. Three deaths occurred in the state, one due to a heart attack and two from drowning in Florida Keys when their shrimp boat sank. Because the storm weakened considerably, impact in North Carolina was generally minor. The storm also spawned at least six tornadoes in the state, which demolished trailers and unroofed homes and other buildings in several communities. Damage throughout the United States totaled $10 million.
=== Unnamed November tropical storm ===

An area of disturbed weather within the ITCZ developed into a tropical depression early on November 5, while located about north-northwest of Colón, Panama. The depression strengthened slowly, reaching tropical storm status on November 6. Thereafter, it curved westward towards Central America. Early on November 7, the storm made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with winds of . Several hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression along the north coast of Honduras early on November 8, shortly before re-emerging into the Caribbean. The storm did not re-intensify and made landfall in Belize on November 9. It dissipated early on the following day.

In Nicaragua, winds and heavy rainfall caused significant crop damage, especially to bananas. Many residents living near the Caratasca Lagoon evacuated. The entire town of Caukira was flooded, with five small houses completely destroyed. Tides were as high as above-normal. In Puerto Castilla, large amounts of precipitation caused flooding and destroyed a bridge, leaving part of the population out of communication. Another bridge collapsed in the town of Rus-Rus. Strong winds and heavy rainfall also resulted in &quot;considerable damage&quot; on the Bay Islands. Overall, the storm resulted in about $5 million in damage.
=== Other systems ===
In addition to the thirteen tropical storms, TIROS VII monitored two systems operationally considered tropical depressions – one on July 15 at and another on September 19 at . However, a re-examination of the satellite imagery as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project did not depict tropical depressions, while ship data was unavailable for either potential cyclone. Thus, it could not be confirmed that either system became a tropical cyclone.

== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1964. This is the same list used in the 1960 season with the exception of &quot;Dora&quot;, which replaced &quot;Donna&quot;. A storm was named &quot;Isbell&quot; for the first time in 1964.

=== Retirement ===

The names &quot;Cleo&quot;, &quot;Dora&quot;, and &quot;Hilda&quot; were later retired and replaced with &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;Dolly&quot;, and &quot;Hannah&quot;, respectively, for the 1968 season. In addition, the names &quot;Ethel&quot;, &quot;Florence&quot;, &quot;Isbell&quot;, and &quot;Winny&quot; would be removed but not retired and replaced by &quot;Edna&quot;, &quot;Frances&quot;, &quot;Ingrid&quot;, and &quot;Wesley&quot; for the 1968 Atlantic hurricane season with no reason cited. 

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1964 USD.

<text>Sydney Missionary and Bible College (SMBC) is an independent, evangelical interdenominational Bible college in Sydney, Australia.

The college was founded in 1916 by C. Benson Barnett. Its goal is to train people for ministry in Australia and abroad. There are two campuses, one in Croydon and another in Croydon Park (opened in 2010).

SMBC is Bible-centred: the academic curriculum is dominated by the Bible and a key focus of the college is to train men and women for gospel ministry in Australia and overseas in a missionary context.

Stuart Coulton, a former principal of SMBC, retired at the beginning of 2020.

Derek Brotherson was appointed as the principal of SMBC in 2020.

SMBC hosts various public talks to give a biblical perspective on current issues such as social media, disability, atheism and miracles.

== History ==
Barnett wrote in 1916, &quot;not only are we a Bible College, but we are a Missionary College ... we are taught by Christ, that we are to pray to the Lord of the Harvest that He will send forth labourers into His harvest field&quot;.

In 2016 a centennial history of SMBC was written by the Rev Anthony Brammall, who is the Academic Vice-Principal at the college and a lecturer in New Testament studies.

== SMBC Press ==
SMBC has published a number of books as well as other resources.

<doc id="762931" wikidata="Q604015" url="?curid=762931" title="Cow Palace">
<text>The Cow Palace (originally the California State Livestock Pavilion) is an indoor arena located in Daly City, California, situated on the city&#x27;s northern border with neighboring San Francisco. Because the border passes through the property, a portion of the upper parking lot is in San Francisco.

The venue first opened in 1941, and has hosted a range of events such as sports, concerts, and political rallies.

==History==
Completed in 1941, it hosted the San Francisco Warriors of the NBA from 1962 to 1964 and again from 1966 to 1971. The Warriors temporarily returned to the Cow Palace to host the 1975 NBA Finals as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena was booked for an Ice Follies performance. It was the site of both the 1956 Republican National Convention and the 1964 Republican National Convention. During the 1960s and 1970s, the SF Examiner Games, a world-class indoor track and field meet, was held annually at the Cow Palace.

The Cow Palace was also an important venue for professional boxing until the early 1980s, having staged regular shows, including ten world title fights and appearances of all-time greats like Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Alexis Arguello. Additionally it has hosted professional wrestling and the Bay Bombers of roller derby; the Derby&#x27;s world championship playoffs were held at the Cow Palace every fall beginning from 1959 through 1973, when the organization was disbanded. From 1956 until 1999, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus visited the Cow Palace, joined in later years by what is now Disney on Ice; both events were later held at Oracle Arena, where Disney on Ice still plays since the reorganisation of Feld Entertainment (which owned both).

The arena seats 11,089 for ice hockey and 12,953 for basketball. When the Warriors played there, its basketball capacity was just over 15,000. It has also been the home of the annual Grand National Rodeo, Horse &amp; Stock Show since 1941 (except for a break from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II). The venue hosted the 1960 men&#x27;s NCAA basketball Final Four and the 1967 NBA All-Star Game. &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; has been held at the Cow Palace since the early 1980s, as has Champions on Ice. In recent years the Cow Palace has been the Bay Area stop for the Cirque du Soleil.

===Naming===
The idea for the arena was inspired by the popularity of the livestock pavilion at the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. 
A local newspaper asked, as early as May 1935, &quot;Why, when people are starving, should money be spent on a &#x27;palace for cows&#x27;?&quot; A headline writer turned the phrase around, thus &quot;Cow Palace&quot;.

===During World War II===
The arena opened in April 1941. During World War II, however, the arena was used for processing soldiers bound for the Pacific Theater. In the following years, it hosted hockey and basketball games, wrestling and boxing matches, concerts, roller derby and political events, most notably the 1956 and 1964 Republican National Conventions. The arena is still used for the Grand National Rodeo and other events.

===Possible sale===

In the spring of 2008, State Senator Leland Yee advanced legislation to allow Daly City to purchase the Cow Palace from the California Department of Food and Agriculture&#x27;s Division of Fairs and Expositions in order to develop housing, basic amenities, and possibly a school for the surrounding area. However, the legislation was opposed by groups that regularly use the venue and other California citizens outside Daly City.

On September 9, 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed this proposed sale of the Cow Palace overflow parking lot. Following the 2008 publicity associated with Leland Yee&#x27;s failed bill, the Cow Palace board of directors entered exclusive negotiations with Cypress Equities for a 60-year lease to develop the proposed by Daly City.
Due to the lack of progress, this agreement was subsequently terminated and negotiations then commenced with a Marin County-based developer in early 2010.

==Sports==
===Professional and college basketball===
The San Francisco Warriors of the National Basketball Association called the Cow Palace home from 1962 to 1964 and from 1966 to 1971. From 1964 to 1966, the Warriors played predominantly at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. The franchise then moved across the bay to the new Oakland Coliseum Arena and changed their name to Golden State Warriors. In 2019, the Warriors moved to the Chase Center in San Francisco.

The Warriors lost to the Boston Celtics in the 1964 NBA Finals. The 1967 NBA Finals between San Francisco and the Philadelphia 76ers saw three games held at the Cow Palace. The two NBA Finals games hosted by the Warriors in their 1974–75 championship season were also held at the Cow Palace because of other events at the Oakland Coliseum.

===Professional football===
In 2010, the Cow Palace once again had a regular sports tenant when the American Indoor Football Association&#x27;s San Jose Wolves kicked off. However, the next year they would move to Stockton as the independent Stockton Wolves.

===Professional soccer===
On and off between 1975 and 1984, the San Jose/Golden Bay Earthquakes of the NASL played indoor soccer at the Cow Palace, including hosting the 1975 NASL indoor championship game, which they won 8–5 over the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The &#x27;Quakes spent several seasons playing at the Oakland Coliseum Arena before splitting time between the two arenas for the 1983–84 NASL Indoor season.

The Major Indoor Soccer League came to the Cow Palace for the 1980–81 season, when David Schoenstadt relocated his Detroit Lightning there, renaming them the San Francisco Fog. After a dismal season with an 11–29 record and less than five thousand fans per game, Schoenstadt moved the franchise again, this time to Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri, where the team flourished as the Kansas City Comets.

===Professional ice hockey===
The San Francisco Shamrocks (PHL) called the Cow Palace home from 1977 to 1979. They won the championship their first season, but ended up disbanding in January 1979 part way through their second season.

It also hosted the San Jose Sharks of the NHL from 1991 to 1993 before the completion of their new home, the San Jose Arena. From 1991 to 1993, the Sharks sold out every game played at the building. It was one of the last buildings to house a smaller than NHL-regulation rink. The NHL had previously rejected the building in 1967 as a home for the expansion California Seals franchise, who instead played home games out of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena.

San Jose lost their first game at the Cow Palace to the Vancouver Canucks 5–2 on October 5, 1991. Wayne Presley scored the first Sharks goal at the arena. Three nights later, San Jose won their first game in franchise history there, a 4–3 win over the Calgary Flames.

The Sharks&#x27; second season in the Cow Palace included a 17-game losing streak and a league record 71 losses. The Sharks ended their run at the Cow Palace at the conclusion of the 1992–93 season with a 3–2 loss to eventual Campbell Conference champion Los Angeles on April 10, 1993. The team moved to the new San Jose Arena (now the SAP Center) to start 1993–94 after going 22–56–4 at their first home.

At the Cow Palace, the Sharks recorded the franchise&#x27;s first win, shutout (Artūrs Irbe) and hat trick (Rob Gaudreau). The team also introduced their mascot, S.J. Sharkie, on the Cow Palace ice in mid-1992 when he climbed out of the front of a Zamboni. He later bungee-jumped from the rafters near the end of the first season.

In 1995, the IHL&#x27;s San Francisco Spiders played their only season at the Cow Palace. Several players who played for the Sharks during their Cow Palace years suited up for the Spiders that year. Due to poor attendance, the team ceased operations at the end of the 1995–96 season.

On September 27, 2011, the ECHL formally announced that pro hockey would return to the Cow Palace after a 16-year hiatus with the arrival of the San Francisco Bulls the following fall. To accommodate the new team its ownership spent $2 million on renovating the team locker rooms, upgrading the concession stands, food improvements and installing new widescreen HD monitors to observe gameplay, installing a new ice system (as the old ammonia-based system that was in place for the Seals, Shamrocks, Sharks &amp; Spiders had since become outdated and illegal) and a new custom-made wraparound LED video scoreboard with its game presentation system and ten sets of Custom Piston speakers from Claire Brothers Audio formerly used by AC/DC. The center hung video board has a 360° view for game presentation and full timekeeping and statistics. The new Colosseo Cube scoreboard – made by Colosseo USA – was custom built in order to agree with some of the weight bearing limitations for the roof. The engineers designed new structural steel beams and had them installed in the rafters to provide the additional support required. The Bulls folded on January 28, 2014, 40 games into their second season.

===Professional tennis===
From 1974 to 1989, the Cow Palace was the site of the Pacific Coast Championships, a yearly tournament on the men&#x27;s professional tennis tour. Some of the biggest names in tennis played there, such as Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl.

===Professional wrestling===
The Palace has also hosted professional wrestling events under various promoters, most notably Roy Shire, who ran cards there from the early 1960s to 1981, oftentimes to sold-out houses headlined by Ray Stevens, Pat Patterson and others. After Shire ended operations, other promotions such as World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) moved in. Notable cards included WCW&#x27;s SuperBrawl in 1997, 1998, and 2000 and WWE&#x27;s No Way Out in 2004. In 2018, the Cow Palace hosted New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s G1 Special in San Francisco.

On March 1 and 3, 2023, the Cow Palace hosted &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; and &quot;AEW Rampage&quot;, leading into AEW Revolution, which was hosted at the Chase Center in San Francisco.

==Events==
===Politics===
The Cow Palace twice hosted the Republican National Convention. Republicans gathered at the Cow Palace for the 1956 Republican National Convention to renominate Dwight D. Eisenhower for president and Richard Nixon for vice president. The ticket won in a landslide.

The Republicans came back eight years later for the 1964 Republican National Convention, at which Barry Goldwater was nominated for president and William Miller was nominated for vice president. They lost to Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey, also in a landslide.

===Concerts===
===Rodeos and livestock expositions===
The Cow Palace is officially the 1-A District Agricultural Association, a State agency of the California Department of Food and Agriculture&#x27;s Division of Fairs and Expositions. It has extensive stable and barn facilities for animal events, which are used for the annual Grand National Rodeo and occasionally for other events. It also used to host events on the now-defunct BRO (Bull Riders Only) tour.

===Media===
In 1982, the Cow Palace stood in for the Houston Coliseum when the 1962 barbecue welcoming NASA to Houston was recreated for the movie &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. The explosion of the starship USS &quot;Reliant&quot;, used in the movie &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, was filmed in the Cow Palace auditorium. The pyrotechnic charge for the shot was suspended over the auditorium floor and the explosion was filmed from below.

=== Conventions ===
On , Open Sauce, a STEM fair stylized like Maker Faire, hosted its 2nd convention in the Cow Palace. The event drew over 25,000 attendees and 550 exhibitors. The purpose of Open Sauce was to fill the void left by Maker Faire&#x27;s original discontinuation in 2019, which has since been revived in 2023 under the same name, but more of a STEM-focused event fair for exhibitors.

<doc id="762932" wikidata="Q2095462" url="?curid=762932" title="Pinball Fantasies">
<text>Pinball Fantasies is a 1992 pinball video game originally developed by Digital Illusions and published by 21st Century Entertainment in Europe for the Amiga home computers. It is the sequel to &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;, which was released earlier in the same year on multiple platforms. In the game, players can choose between any of the four available playfields, both of which have their own thematic and main objectives in order to obtain the highest score possible.

&quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; was created by the same team who previously developed &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; and although it was initially released for the Amiga computers, the title was later ported to other computers and consoles including the Amiga CD32, Atari Jaguar, Game Boy, MS-DOS, PlayStation and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original version.

Upon its release on the Amiga, &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; was met with critical acclaim from video game magazines and garnered praise for several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, audio, gameplay and overall improvements from its predecessor. Other versions of the game were met with a mostly similar positive response from reviewers, with some publications like &quot;PC Gamer&quot; regarding it as one of the best video games of all time. A follow-up, &quot;Pinball Illusions&quot;, was released in 1995.

== Gameplay ==

Like &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;, &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; is an arcade-style pinball game featuring four types of pinball tables and each one has their own main objective, gameplay mechanics and thematic. The game has various levels of difficulty and the player can set the number of balls for play, among other gameplay options. In certain versions of the game, high-scores and other settings made by the player are automatically kept via the cartridge&#x27;s internal EEPROM, as well as reset the internal memory of the cartridge to erase saved high-scores and personal settings.

=== Tables ===
&quot;Party Land&quot;, the table included in the shareware release, is oriented around an amusement park where the letters of either &quot;PARTY&quot; or &quot;CRAZY&quot; must be lit to start a high-scoring event. &quot;Speed Devils&quot; is focused on car racing and the players must overtake cars to take the lead position. &quot;Billion Dollar Gameshow&quot; is a game show-style table where players attempt to win prizes by achieving certain combinations of ramps. &quot;Stones &#x27;N Bones&quot; is based on a haunted house, where players must light eight successively more rewarding modes by completing a bank of targets marked &quot;STONE-BONE&quot; and then cycle continuously through the modes.

All four tables award one extra ball at the instant the highest score on the list is exceeded, and when the match at the end succeeds. Each table also has one special ramp (Speed Devils has two), which keeps track of the number of hits as a running total of Cyclones (Party Land), Miles (Speed Devils), Skills (Billion Dollar Gameshow) or Screams (Stones &#x27;N Bones). The first shot counts for two. Each of these shots is worth 100,000 points in the bonus. With the exception of Party Land, the tables also award special awards at specific numbers. Each of the four tables has one or two high-scoring rounds that can be started by achieving certain objectives. Specific numbers of Miles and Skills trigger their respective tables&#x27; rounds. The scores for these modes, excluding &quot;Tower Hunt&quot;, are awarded as part of the bonus though not multiplied and can be lost if the game is tilted.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; was created by the original team who previously developed &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; at Digital Illusions. Producer Barry Simpson led the project&#x27;s development process, with Fredrik Liljegren acting as manager and chief. Andreas Axelsson and Ulf Mandorff served as programmers, while Olof Gustafsson composed the soundtrack and created the sound effects. Markus Nyström acted as the game&#x27;s sole artist. The game was first released for the Amiga by 21st Century Entertainment in Europe in October 1992. In September 1993, an Amiga CD32 conversion was released, based upon the improved Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) version for the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000. It was later ported to MS-DOS computers by FrontLine Design, offering multiple audio options. The DOS port was digitally re-released by Rebellion Developments on 22 February 2011 on Good Old Games with support for Microsoft Windows. It received an OS X build on 23 April 2013 and a Linux build on 19 August 2014 respectively. A compilation including the tables from &quot;Pinball Mania&quot; was released for DOS as &quot;Pinball Fantasies Deluxe&quot;.

In February 1995, versions for both the Game Boy and Super Nintendo Entertainment System were developed by Spidersoft and released in North America and Europe by GameTek. The Super NES port contains all four tables and the same music as the Amiga version, but suffers from a limited color palette. The SNES version was also published in Brazil by Playtronic in February 1996. In June 1995, an Atari Jaguar conversion by Spidersoft with extra colors was co-published by 21st Century Entertainment and Computer West in North America and Europe. The Jaguar port was also distributed in Japan by Messe Sansao. A PlayStation compilation created by Spidersoft titled &quot;Pinball Fantasies Deluxe&quot; was published exclusively in Japan by VAP on 25 October 1996, which also includes the &quot;Pinball Mania&quot; tables but these have to be unlocked first.

A Game Boy Advance version of the game, under the title &quot;Pinball Challenge Deluxe&quot;, with tables added from &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;, was released only in Europe by Ubi Soft. On 20 July 2009, an iOS version was released by Cowboy Rodeo. Between October and December of the same year, a PlayStation Network version was released by Cowboy Rodeo for PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. A Nokia N9 version was released 20 July 2011 by Cowboy Rodeo in the Nokia Store. In 2012, a 3D/HD rendition was released for iOS by Cowboy Rodeo.

== Reception ==
&quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; was a major commercial success, and among its era&#x27;s highest-selling games.

&quot;GamePro&quot; panned the Super NES version. The reviewer remarked that though there is a large number of tables, the scrolling is so jerky that the game is almost unplayable. He further criticized that the graphics are dull and fail to make the ramps and obstacles of the tables stand out from the backgrounds. &quot;Next Generation&quot; also found the fact that the Super NES version displays less than half of the table at a time to be a problem, in part because of the poor scrolling, but also because &quot;Since a lot of the scoring devices are near the top of the table, it means that most of the time you&#x27;re shooting blind.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Jaguar version an only slightly more positive assessment. The reviewer praised the graphics but assessed the game to be completely lacking in fun due to the limited gameplay, stating that &quot;anybody who thinks a $60 video game should offer some imaginative surprises will be severely disappointed.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; the 33rd best computer game ever. The editors hailed it as &quot;the best and most realistic pinball action ever seen on a PC screen&quot;. That same year, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the 19th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;[I]f Pinball&#x27;s your thing, there&#x27;s currently nothing on the PC (or any home system, for that matter) better than this&quot;. In 1995, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; presented &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; with its 1994 &quot;Best Arcade Game&quot; award.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Game Boy version a 4 out of 10, citing a lack of excitement in any of the tables, overly simplistic graphics, and annoying sound effects.

<text>Francis Scarpaleggia (born June 6, 1957 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian politician. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and Member of Parliament for the riding of Lac-Saint-Louis, which encompasses the west of the island of Montreal, Quebec. Scarpaleggia was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2004 federal election, and was re-elected in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021. He is chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and previously served on a variety of House of Commons committees; namely, the committees on Public Safety, Canadian Heritage, Transport, and Government Operations and Estimates. He was also chair of the House of Commons Special Committee on Electoral Reform, a committee created pursuant to a 2015 Liberal election platform commitment on electoral reform. From 2011 to 2021 he served as the chair of the National Liberal Caucus, an eventful period in Canadian politics that saw the Liberal Party of Canada move from third-party status in the House of Commons (second opposition party) to forming government in one election cycle under the leadership of Justin Trudeau.

== Education ==

Scarpaleggia attended Loyola High School, a semi-private Jesuit-run high school in western Montreal, and subsequently Marianopolis College and McGill University where he obtained an honours degree in economics. Following graduation from McGill, he studied at Columbia University in New York, obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in economics. He then obtained an MBA at Montreal&#x27;s Concordia University.

== Career before politics ==

Following graduation from business school, he joined the private sector working for Petro-Canada and Comterm, a Quebec-based microcomputer and keyboard-terminal manufacturer and local-area-network software developer. He subsequently entered Montreal&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry as a corporate financial analyst working for Bristol-Myers Squibb, and transitioned to education, teaching business administration at Montreal&#x27;s Dawson College.

== Political career ==

Scarpaleggia&#x27;s involvement in politics began as a volunteer in the riding of Mount Royal during the 1981 Quebec election, working for the Liberal incumbent John Ciaccia, who was re-elected to the provincial legislature. Following the election, which saw the separatist Parti Québécois elected for a second term, he remained active as a grassroots provincial Liberal organizer, notably serving as the youngest riding president (Mount Royal provincial riding association) in the Quebec Liberal Party at the time. In 1984, he became involved in the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal riding of Mount Royal.

Prior to being elected, he worked from 1994 to 2004 as legislative assistant to Clifford Lincoln, a former environment minister in the Quebec government who then served, after entering federal politics, as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of the Environment and then as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.

Scarpaleggia was first elected to Parliament in the 2004 Canadian federal election following a competitive local nomination contest.

Since first being elected, he has focused on issues of freshwater protection, introducing various water bills and motions in the House of Commons, including a bill to ban bulk-water exports. As a member of the House of Commons environment committee, he has initiated water-focused studies such a study on the Alberta oilsands industry&#x27;s impacts on the Athabasca River watershed.

He holds a reputation as a dedicated constituency representative, close to his electors and focused on their political concerns and priorities.

== Personal life ==

Scarpaleggia was born in 1957, the son of Maurice Scarpaleggia, a businessman turned college administrator, and Lois Doucet. His paternal grandfather, Frank Scarpaleggia, was a Montreal barber and barbershop owner. His maternal grandfather, Louis Doucet, worked in building services at Montreal&#x27;s historic Sun Life Building. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Italy and his maternal grandmother immigrated from Ireland. His maternal grandfather was French-Canadian born in Quebec.

He was raised in Laval, Quebec, and later in the Town of Mount Royal, a Montreal-island suburb. He has been married to Jan Ramsay since 1998. They have two grown daughters.

<text>Church planting is a term referring to the process (mostly in Protestant frameworks) that results in a new local Christian congregation being established. It should be distinguished from church development, where a new service, worship center or fresh expression is created that is integrated into an already established congregation. For a local church to be planted, it must eventually have a separate life of its own and be able to function without its parent body, even if it continues to stay in relationship denominationally or through being part of a network.

==History of church planting==
According to the Rev. Mike Ruhl, &quot;Church planting has been happening for nearly twenty centuries.&quot; The first place that the church spread from Judea was Samaria. Christianity spread to other areas because persecution forced the Christians to leave Jerusalem. Christianity then spread to the Gentiles largely because of the Apostle Paul, who had formerly been a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church. In the Bible, the book of Acts describes Christianity as spreading by the preaching of it in public areas. It then describes the believers of Christianity as gathering together regularly in homes and, at least in the beginning, at the Temple in Jerusalem. This period is known as the Apostolic Period. During this period, and up until the late second century, there is no record of church buildings; instead, there are references to house churches. Not much is known about how these house churches multiplied. After the late second century, church buildings became the norm. In 380, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, which convinced many to become Christians. As Germanic kings conquered areas of the Roman Empire, many of them converted to Christianity to gain the support of their new subjects. 

In British colonies, Anglican missionary and church planting efforts coincided with British colonialism. The missionary model of Baptist missionaries, such as in mid-twentieth century Brazil, was a form of church planting. For Southern Baptists, church planting, with its focus on establishing new and independent congregations, is a logical outcome of their theology. &quot;Southern Baptist mission work was driven by church planting. Based on a voluntaristic faith, the work defined individual salvation as the cornerstone of religious life; and religious life took place within local, autonomous congregations.&quot; 

Recently, there has been a focus on Church Planting Movements. However, not all SBC/IMB members agree with the general theory of church planting movements and think much of it is, detrimentally, man- and method- focused rather than centered on God. Church planting is not troublesome but the &quot;movements&quot; part of the theory is For a discussion on the viability of church planting movements, Linda Bergquist and Michael Crane argue for and against the notion.

Holy Trinity Brompton, a Church of England church in London, has been involved in planting churches since the 1980s. Its plants form the HTB network. In May 2015, the Church of England announced that the See of Islington would be brought out of abeyance to create a &quot;bishop for church plants&quot;. The bishop would be based in the Diocese of London but would also assist the whole Church. The following month, Ric Thorpe was announced as the first bishop for church plants. , there are 49 churches in the HTB network.

==Models of church planting==
There are several different models of church planting:
* Parachute or parachute drop method. In this method, a church planter and family move into a new location to start a church from scratch. 
* Another method is for an existing church or church planting organization, known as the &quot;mother&quot; church, to provide the initial leadership, money, and personnel to start a new &quot;daughter&quot; or &quot;mission&quot; church. This may also be done by a group of organizations working together. The daughter church may either serve a new housing development, or may serve a specific cultural group which speaks a different language than the mother church.
**One expression of this model is called the hiving method, in which a church sends a portion of its membership to start the new church.
* Another method is the &quot;house church&quot;, or cell church, method. Small groups, called cells, which meet in homes may form and multiply using a relational model (see house church). Some cell groups are networked with one another and periodically meet together in a larger group.
* A church may also be planted when an existing church splits. 
* Finally, the expansion of a multi-site church may result in new locations being established; however, this is not the same as church planting (and, in some cases, is the result of the main church taking over a struggling independent congregation). 

==Advocates==
C. Peter Wagner describes church planting as &quot;the single most effective evangelistic methodology under heaven&quot; and for its advocates this remains church planting&#x27;s greatest rationale. Gisbertus Voetius, a Dutch Reformer, viewed the purpose of Christian missions as threefold: conversion, church planting, and the glorification of God&#x27;s grace. Georg Vicedom, in his book &quot;The Mission of God&quot;, says the goal of Christian missions to both proclaim the message and to gather people into the church.

==Territorial objections==

For Anglicans and Catholics, &quot;church-planting&quot; can be very problematic because of the territorial nature of a diocese. For both the Catholic and Anglican churches, this practice may be viewed as an abrogation of the rights of a local bishop. This is because the bishop of the diocese has the right to decide where churches will be planted, and the phenomenon of church planting sometimes ignores both courtesy and obedience to the local bishop. Traditionally the Catholic Church has used this method in its missionary work to establish the initial church of a region or colony with the goal of establishing a brand new diocese. However in the modern era the necessity of this method has declined partly due to the global nature of the modern church.

This issue is particularly sensitive in regard to the Anglican diocese of Sydney in Australia, from which many Evangelical churches are &quot;planted&quot; in non-evangelical dioceses.

The Church of England has begun its Fresh Expressions initiative, which is seeking to encourage the development of new congregations even when they are across parish boundaries, for the sake of mission, under the bishop&#x27;s permission. The recent Anglican conference GAFCON contained a broad hint that it would consider offering oversight to churches that have been planted without authorization from the local bishops.

==Church planting movement==
In a missiological context, church planting may be defined as &quot;initiating reproductive fellowships who reflect the kingdom of God in the world.&quot; When this happens with rapid growth, it is generally known as a church planting movement or disciple making movement. In a church planting movement, indigenous churches plant more churches within a people group or geographic area. A church will sponsor formation of multiple spinoff churches that will themselves very quickly reproduce new churches, generally with common teachings and doctrine. It is different from traditional missions in that the new churches are generally started by a lay leader from the sponsoring church and not an outside missionary. A key characteristic of an authentic church planting movement is the rapidity with which a new congregation itself starts another similar church.

===History of church planting movements===
The modern Church Planting Movement can trace its roots to the mid-nineteenth century when Henry Venn and Rufus Anderson developed the three-self formula of an indigenous missions policy: &quot;they believed that young churches should be self-propagating, self-supporting, and self-governing from their inception.&quot; Donald McGavran, a missionary in India who &quot;coined the concept of &#x27;people movements&#x27; to Christ,&quot; is credited as an early proponent of the kind of missionary work that underlies the Church Planting Movement, by focusing his missionary work on converting groups of people (&quot;groups, tribes, villages, ethnic groups&quot;) rather than individuals.

According to &quot;One Magazine&quot;, the official organ of the National Association of Free Will Baptists, such tactics were used successfully in Cuba in the 1940s by Tom and Mabel Willey; in the 1950s in North India Carlisle and Marie Hanna; and in the 1960s in Ivory Coast by LaVerne Miley. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; also claims success in Cuba for the &quot;Western Baptists, historically linked to the Southern Baptist Convention.&quot; Bhojpuri church planting movement was started by David L. Watson and produced thousands of Churches from the beginning of Nineties. This is also the longest surviving (rather thriving) movement in the world. It has become Movementum now and still producing thousands of Churches. This movement is also referred to where the term church planting movement originated. This Movement has impacted many other countries and continues to impact the other parts of India as well.

===Essentials of church planting movements===
There are three key characteristics of a Church Planting Movement: it reproduces rapidly, multiplying churches, and that the churches are indigenous.
*Within a very short time, newly planted churches are already starting new churches that follow the same pattern of rapid reproduction. Though the rate varies from place to place, Church Planting Movements always outstrip the population growth rate as they race toward reaching the entire people group. Where with other methods of church planting it may take five years to plant a church, with church planting movement, multiple generations of churches may be planted within five months.
*&quot;Church Planting Movements do not simply add new churches. Instead, they multiply.&quot; Most churches in the middle of a Movement will start as many churches as they can, with a goal of filling the area with new churches.
*Church Planting Movements are indigenous. It may start with the training from a non-native missionary or church member, but will very quickly form new congregations that are all within a single ethnic people group. Leaders are self-identified by their willingness to do what the trainer asks them, and then are given additional instruction on how to reproduce new churches.
*Church Planting Movements train leaders.

===Methods===
There is not a solitary method used to spark a church planting movement. The &quot;Training for Trainers (T4T)&quot; method has been successful in China. It differs from the Insider Movement in that leaders do not seek to act like indigenous persons, but simply train locals who train others within their (or closely related) people group. One popular interrelated element with T4T is called OBD (Obedience Based Discipleship) but it has not met with acceptance from certain church planters.

<text>Exposition Park was the name given to three historic stadiums, located in what is today Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The fields were used mainly for professional baseball and American football from c. 1879 to c. 1915. The ballparks were initially located on the north side of the Allegheny River in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. The city was annexed into Pittsburgh (then often spelled &quot;Pittsburg&quot;) in 1907, which became the city&#x27;s North Side, located across from Pittsburgh&#x27;s downtown area. Due to flooding from the nearby Allegheny River, the three stadiums&#x27; exact locations varied somewhat. The final version of the ballpark was between the eventual sites of Three Rivers Stadium and PNC Park.

In 1903, the third incarnation of Exposition Park was the first National League ballpark to host a World Series game. The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP)—known today as the University of Pittsburgh—played home football games at Exposition Park, and also used the park as a home field for the university&#x27;s baseball team.

==History==
===Exposition Park I and II===
Local newspapers referred to the general area along the Allegheny waterfront as &quot;the Exposition grounds&quot;, named for other &quot;expositions&quot; that would be shown there, including horse racing and circuses.

Exposition Park I was the first venue in Pittsburgh that hosted major league baseball. In 1882, the club now known as the Pittsburgh Pirates—then known simply as Allegheny, or informally as &quot;the Alleghenys&quot;—began play at Exposition Park as a member of the American Association; however, after one season a fire and flooding of the field from the nearby river forced a second park to be built.

Despite its reason for construction, Exposition Park II was built closer to the river. The Alleghenys played at the second incarnation of the park for the first part of the 1883 season, but after the game of June 9, the club decided to return to Exposition Park I, starting with the game of June 12. The Allegheny club abandoned Expo II in 1884, moving to Recreation Park, which was several blocks north and out of the flood plain. The final usage of Expo II for baseball came in the last week of August, 1884, where the struggling Union Association club dubbed the Pittsburgh Stogies finished out their schedule after moving from Chicago.

During 1884 through 1889, the ballpark was primarily a racetrack used for many types of events: horse racing, bicycle racing, foot racing, and various exhibitions such as circuses. The grandstand ran roughly west-to-east, bordering South Avenue. The roof included five pyramid-shaped turrets. In 1887 came a short-lived attempt to rename the facility Gentlemen&#x27;s Driving Park, ads for which typically appended &quot;formerly Exposition Park&quot;. When the Players&#x27; League club began, they reconfigured the former racetrack for baseball purposes, including retaining a couple of the turrets left over from the track&#x27;s grandstand.

===Exposition Park III===

While the Alleghenys were playing home games at Recreation Park, owners John Beemer and M. B. Lennon of the Pittsburgh Burghers reconfigured the former racetrack into a proper baseball park near the former sites of Exposition Parks I and II, approximately two blocks west of where PNC Park sits today. Exposition Park III included a roofed wooden grandstand around the infield, in the northeast corner of the block, and open bleacher sections extending to the right and left field corners. Total capacity was about 10,000 spectators. The seats faced the Allegheny River and the Point. The Burghers played at the stadium during the 1890 Players&#x27; League season—both the team and league&#x27;s only season in existence. On June 10, 1890, Jocko Fields of the Pittsburgh Burghers hit the first home run at Exposition Park III.

The recurrent flooding which plagued the location through its entire existence led to this editorial comment about the Brotherhood (Players&#x27; League) club: &quot;They have the most level grounds in the country. Exposition Park is covered with water.&quot;
The newly-redubbed Pittsburgh Pirates moved to Exposition Park the following season. On April 24, 1891, Fred Carroll hit the first home run by a Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of Fred Clarke the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and Boston Americans owner Henry Killilea organized a best of nine-game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. This first modern World Series held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1. On October 6, 1903, 7,600 people attended the first World Series game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000 people attended the game, forcing some spectators to stand behind a rope in the outfield. The Pirates lost three of four games at Exposition Park and eventually the Series.

During a July 4, 1902 doubleheader against the Brooklyn Superbas (whose roster included a player named Flood), an Allegheny flood caused water to rise to thigh level in center and right fields, and about head level in deep center. Players occasionally caught a ball and dove under the water. The Pirates won both games of the doubleheader. Ham Hyatt is believed to be the only person to hit a ball over the right field fence. Monument Hill, which overlooked the field, allowed spectators a free view of the game.
In 1906, the Pirates were the first baseball team to cover their field with a tarp during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems. Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing ground rules that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. In 1907, Pittsburgh&#x27;s pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter at Exposition Park. That would prove to be the last no-hitter thrown at a Pirates home field until Bob Gibson of the Cardinals no-hit the Pirates in 1971, at Three Rivers.

In 1908, owing to the large numbers of people that attended Pirates games, team owner Barney Dreyfuss began looking for a location to construct a new Pirates stadium. The final Pirates game at Exposition Park was played against the Chicago Cubs on June 29, 1909. The Pirates won the game 8–1 in front of 5,545 people, with George Gibson achieving the final National League hit in the ballpark. The very next day, the Pirates once again played the Cubs as the team opened Forbes Field.
The Pittsburgh Filipinos called Exposition Park their home in 1912. The Filipinos lasted just over a month after folding with the United States Baseball League. In 1914, the Pittsburgh Stogies began play at Exposition Park. There were some cosmetic changes to the ballpark, including the removal of the rooftop turrets, and construction of a roof over the bleachers on the first base side. In 1915, the team, renamed the Pittsburgh Rebels, improved from the previous season, finishing just percentage points behind the first place Chicago Whales. After the season, the club disbanded along with the entire Federal League, due to financial losses. That was the end of major league ball at Exposition Park. The venue continued to host Semi-professional baseball games, circuses, scrap metal drives and other events, but &quot;was eventually razed&quot;. The 1917 city directory gave the ballpark&#x27;s address as 700 South Avenue. South Avenue later became General Robinson Drive, and the 700 address corresponds to the ballpark&#x27;s main entrance, now part of a parking lot.

====Dimensions====
In an article on the soon-to-be-opened Forbes Field, the Pittsburgh &quot;Post&quot; for June 27, 1909, stated the Expo Park dimensions as follows: left field , center field , right field .

===Football===
The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), which would in 1908 be renamed the University of Pittsburgh, played its first official game at Exposition Park on October 11, 1890, when Shadyside Academy failed to show up for their game with the Allegheny Athletic Association. The Allegheny A.A. made a call to WUP team founder Bert Smyers to bring the WUP team to the park as a replacement. The WUP team was subsequently defeated 38–0. The WUP football team began playing games more regularly at Exposition Park around 1900, occasionally playing in other local venues. Prior to the 1903 season, Arthur Mosse was recruited from the University of Kansas to become the team&#x27;s new coach. In addition to players that Mosse brought with him, WUP also recruited players from Geneva College to play on the team. Mosse&#x27;s first season was a disappointment as the WUP football team went 0–8–1 and supporters of the team disbanded leaving the team $500 in debt. George Hubbard Clapp then organized a voluntary $5 &quot;athletic fee&quot; to be paid by students in order to allow the debt to be repaid and the school&#x27;s football team to play home games at Exposition Park during the next season in order to give the WUP team a more permanent and stable home. Mosse and university officials then obtained a lease to play at Exposition Park during the fall from Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss for 20% of the admission fee. The 1904 WUP team, the first full season in which WUP played at Exposition Park, saw WUP achieve a remarkable turnaround that included a 10–0 record in which they outscored opponents 407–5 and finished second in the state behind the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to home games at Exposition Park, WUP students would organize parades through downtown streets prior to marching across a bridge to the game. A gong, used to announce the beginning of Pirates games, was also sounded prior to the opening kickoff of WUP football contests.

==Today==

After parts of 62 seasons in the Oakland district, baseball and football returned to the north side of the Allegheny River when Three Rivers Stadium opened. The site of the final incarnation of Exposition Park, relative to Three Rivers and the later PNC Park, was in between the two venues.

Exposition Park had been on the southwest corner of South Avenue (later Robinson) to the north (first base) and School Street (later Scotland) to the east (third base). To the south (left field) was some open space and railroad tracks and the Allegheny. To the west (right field) was some open space and then Grant Street (later Galveston). That open space would eventually be the site of Three Rivers. Therefore, the site of Exposition Park was the northeast corner of the parking lot east of Three Rivers.

In 1995, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the location where home plate is believed to have been located, in honor of one of the two sites of the first World Series (the other being in Boston). At the time, the location of home plate was in a Three Rivers Stadium parking lot. In 2018, the faded home plate paint was replaced by a metal plaque by the Society for American Baseball Research.

In 1998, a Pennsylvania Historical marker was placed at the site of the park. Interstate 279 currently runs over portions of the site of Exposition Park just before crossing the Allegheny River along the Fort Duquesne Bridge.

<text>The Alpine Line () or Little Maginot Line (French: &quot;Petite Ligne Maginot&quot;) was the component of the Maginot Line that defended the southeastern portion of France. In contrast to the main line in the northeastern portion of France, the Alpine Line traversed a mountainous region of the Maritime Alps, the Cottian Alps and the Graian Alps, with relatively few passes suitable for invading armies. Access was difficult for construction and for the Alpine Line garrisons. Consequently, fortifications were smaller in scale than the fortifications of the main Line. The Alpine Line mounted few anti-tank weapons, since the terrain was mostly unsuitable for the use of tanks. Ouvrage Rimplas was the first Maginot fortification to be completed on any portion of the Maginot Line, in 1928. The Alpine Line was unsuccessfully attacked by Italian forces during the Italian invasion of France in 1940. Following World War II, some of the larger positions of the Alpine Line were retained in use through the Cold War.

==Concept==
As France studied measures to protect its northeastern frontier with Germany, a parallel effort was made to examine the improvement of France&#x27;s defenses against Italy in the southeast. France&#x27;s Italian border was a relic of the 1860 Treaty of Turin in which the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice were incorporated into France. The treaty boundary roughly followed the crest of the Maritime Alps inland through the Cottian Alps to Switzerland. The precise line of demarcation left the upper reaches of many westward-draining valleys in Italian hands, thus giving Italy positions on high points overlooking French territory, those however were most impractical and inadequate.

The region had been extensively fortified in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most notably by Vauban, whose fortifications of Briançon have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières in the late nineteenth century, who expanded the Fort de Tournoux and other fortifications in the area as part of the Séré de Rivières system of fortifications. Passage through the Alps was possible only at a series of comparatively low passes, and movement toward the major cities of southeastern France such as Lyon, Grenoble or Nice was possible only along a series of deep river valleys. Defenses therefore tended to concentrate in consistent locations:

* Bourg-Saint-Maurice in the Tarentaise, facing the Little St Bernard Pass
* Modane in the Maurienne, facing the Mont Cenis pass
* Briançon, facing the Col de Montgenèvre
* Barcelonnette, facing the Col de Larche
* Approaches to Nice from the north, with defenses in the Tinée and Vesubie valleys, around Sospel and on the Authion Massif
* Menton and Nice, guarding the coastal road and railway line

In 1925 General Charles Nollet, the Minister of War, directed General Jean Degoutte to survey the southeastern frontier and to make recommendations for their defense. Degoutte&#x27;s proposal used principles of defense in depth to economize on manpower and funds, which were needed for the main Maginot defenses in northeastern France. The still-ambitious plan proposed in 1927 envisioned a series of fortified positions right on the frontier divides at every potential crossing, backed by thirty-six centers of resistance, each with fourteen infantry casemates and twelve infantry shelters, a total of about one thousand blockhouses. Costs were estimated at 250 million francs.

The proposed plan was criticized for placing the fortifications too far forward by the &quot;Commission de Defense&quot;, but the overall organization was approved by Minister of War (and former Prime Minister) Paul Painlevé, with a strategy of fortifying Menton, Sospel and the valleys of the Vésubie and Tinée. Revisions in late 1927 proposed about 400 positions at a cost of between 400 million and 500 million francs. The plan was altered in 1928 by General Fillonneau, who proposed to concentrate fortifications along potential invasion axes, rather than along a continuous line. The geographic emphasis remained on Menton and Sospel, but the concept of frontal confrontation was replaced by a strategy of attack from the flanks of a potential advance. Fillonneau was assisted by the new management organization for the Maginot fortifications, the &quot;Commission d&#x27;Organisation des Régions Fortifiés&quot;, or CORF. The proposal was estimated to cost 700 million francs to build 103 &quot;ouvrages&quot; and to reconstruct 28 old fortifications. An initial phase, designed to protect Nice, was estimated to cost 205 million francs

Unlike the relatively thin, linear defenses of the northeast, the revised Alpine fortifications extended some distance back from the frontier, with forward defenses supported by rearward defenses, compartmentalized by the terrain into distinct sectors. A final proposal in 1930 established a scaled-back, prioritized programme of 362 million francs to be executed in two phases, with the second phase to cost an additional 62 million francs.

==Description==

As with the main Maginot Line of the northeast, positions took the form of concrete-encased strongpoints linked by tunnels, which housed living quarters, magazines and utilities for the &quot;ouvrage&quot;. Larger &quot;ouvrages&quot; were provided with narrow gauge rail lines to move materials and munitions, although unlike the northeastern positions, none were electrified. Because of the mountainous terrain and the vertical character of the sites chosen for fortification, individual blocks typically emerged from rock faces in a steep hillside or cliff with mined galleries within under rock cover. By comparison, most northeastern &quot;ouvrages&quot; were semi-submerged into the gently rolling soil with galleries deeply buried beneath earth cover. 
In addition to the linked complexes of blockhouses that formed the grand and petit ouvrages, the country around and between each position was provided with isolated blockhouses, observation points, shelters (or &quot;abris&quot;), outposts (&quot;avants postes&quot;) and batteries, using much the same vocabulary of rounded concrete forms as the primary line of fortifications. These positions allowed the use of mobile supporting artillery, and provided rallying and control points for the necessary infantry support in the country between strongpoints, as the security of the border did not and could not depend on subterranean fortifications alone. The disposition of forward outposts, backed by heavier fortifications some kilometers to the rear, provided a defense in depth that was, in the case of the Alpine fortifications, supported by the difficult terrain.

===Organization===
The Alpine Line was divided into three major sectors. From north to south, they were:

* Fortified Sector of Savoy &quot;(secteur fortifié de Savoie)&quot;, divided into two principal sections, the Tarentaise valley around Bourg-Saint-Maurice, and the Maurienne valley around Modane.
* Fortified Sector of the Dauphiné &quot;(secteur fortifié du Dauphiné)&quot;, protecting Briançon and the Ubaye Valley opposite the Col de Larche.
* Fortified Sector of the Maritime Alps &quot;(secteur fortifié des Alpes-Maritimes)&quot;, covering the Tinée and Vésubie valleys and the coast around Sospel and Menton.

In addition, the area to the north of the principal fortifications was organized as the Defensive Sector of the Rhône, with virtually no fixed fortifications, since it faced neutral Switzerland.

The Alpine region was under the overall command of the Army of the Alps, General René Olry in command at Valence. Its chief units were the 14th Army Corps in the SF Savoy and SF Dauphiné, and the 15th Corps in the SF Maritime Alps.

==Construction==
Work had already begun on Ouvrage Rimplas, which was in fact the first Maginot &quot;ouvrage&quot; to be built in either the northeast or southeast. The construction contract was signed 7 September 1928 with incomplete plans. Rimplas was a prototype project, not representative of other alpine or Maginot positions. CORF took over responsibility for construction in 1931, standardizing design practices, although each project was closely adapted to local circumstances. Construction was made difficult by poor access, high altitude and a short construction season. In 1931 work commenced at twenty-two sites. In 1932 Ouvrage Cap Martin was sufficiently complete that it could be used in an emergency. Work continued through 1936, even though CORF had been disestablished at the end of 1935. While most of the larger positions were complete, a number of the smaller, higher-altitude positions were never completed in time for war in 1940. From 1939, the &quot;main d&#x27;oeuvre Militaire&quot; (MOM) built a number of positions and blockhouses, usually in locations close to the frontier. Many of the MOM positions were incomplete in 1940.

Compared with the northeastern Maginot positions, the Alpine fortifications made comparatively little use of retracting turrets, using instead concreted casemates in mountainsides surveying prepared fields of fire. The Alpine Line featured relatively few artillery &quot;ouvrages&quot;, tending instead to use mixed-arms positions that combined artillery casemates and infantry positions. The main fortifications were supported by infantry shelters, or &quot;abris&quot;, of both the &quot;passive&quot;, lightly armed type, and &quot;active&quot; &quot;abris&quot; with heavier armament. Some of the mountaintop &quot;gros ouvrages&quot; used aerial tramways for their primary means of access. Military roads were often constructed in the absence of existing access. All of the large positions were provided with subterranean barracks and central utility plants. Nearly all fortifications were excavated from solid rock. Coverage could therefore be reduced compared to the &quot;ouvrages&quot; of the northeast, which were at depths of up to in deep soil to resist heavy siege artillery. Independent means of power generation were a necessity in the absence of a utility distribution system. Likewise, telephone communication was problematic, with many positions using line-of-sight optical semaphores for communication.

==June 1940==
Like the main Maginot Line did with the Germans, the Alpine Line achieved the goal of preventing the Italians from advancing through the protected areas. And, as the Italians had no alternative but to directly confront the fortifications, the south of France was completely protected from the Italian advance. An advance along the main coastal road was delayed by stiff resistance at the Casemate du Pont Saint Louis on the border at Menton, which was manned by seven men led by a non-commissioned officer and was supported by main-line fortifications at Ouvrage Cap Martin. A direct assault on Cap Saint Martin was suppressed by the &quot;ouvrage&quot; itself, supported by artillery fire from Ouvrage Mont Agel.

Two more attacks were mounted, in the areas of Briançon and the Little St Bernard Pass, with little effect due to weather and the difficult terrain. Positions in the high Alps were shelled by Italian forces but were not directly attacked. Ouvrage Barbonnet traded fire with Italian positions prior to the armistice of 25 June 1940.

==&quot;Vallo Alpino&quot;==
The Italian counterpart to the Alpine Line was Italy&#x27;s Alpine Wall (&quot;Vallo Alpino&quot;), the western portions of which faced the Alpine Line across the Alpine Valleys.

<text>Marc Godbout (born June 8, 1951) is a Canadian politician, teacher and education administrator. He is the former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ottawa—Orléans riding. He was first elected in the 2004 Canadian federal election, representing the Liberal Party of Canada.

Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Godbout has a master&#x27;s degree in education from the University of Ottawa.

Before entering politics, he worked as a high school history teacher. He has been Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for elementary and secondary education in Ontario and Director General and Secretary Treasurer of the Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est de l’Ontario.

He entered federal politics by running for the Liberal nomination against sitting Liberal MP Eugène Bellemare. Bellemare, who held the riding for several elections, was removed. After his defeat in the nomination, Bellemare retired from politics.

Godbout succeeded in beating the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson in the general election of 2004, by a slim majority. He campaigned on bringing more federal government jobs to the east end of Ottawa.

In the 2006 general election, Godbout ran on a platform of Liberal support for municipalities and infrastructure. After eighteen years of the riding being held by the Liberals, Godbout was defeated for re-election when the Conservative Party of Canada won the riding under Royal Galipeau in the federal election of January 23, 2006.

Godbout, along with a number of former and present Ontario Liberal MPs endorsed party leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy. At the Liberal Party Convention in Montreal, Godbout supported Michael Ignatieff after Kennedy dropped off the ballot. At the final ballot, Ignatieff was defeated by Stéphane Dion.

On April 29, 2007, Godbout was nominated to run in the 40th Canadian federal election in a re-match against Galipeau. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, Godbout lost for the second time in a row to Conservative incumbent Royal Galipeau, and this time by an increased majority. The re-election of Galipeau marks the first time a Conservative candidate has been re-elected in the Orléans riding since 1872.

In July 2009, Godbout announced that he would not make another run at reclaiming the riding in the next federal election. He said the decision was a professional one, as he wanted to focus on his business, a consulting firm, operating out of the east end.

<text>The British Archaeological Association (BAA) was founded in 1843 and aims to inspire, support and disseminate high quality research in the fields of Western archaeology, art and architecture, primarily of the mediaeval period, through lectures, conferences, study days and publications.

The BAA was founded in December 1843 by Charles Roach Smith, Thomas Wright and Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, to encourage the recording, preservation, and publication of archaeological discoveries, and to lobby for government assistance for the collection of British antiquities. All three men were Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London but felt the older body was too aristocratic, too London-focused and lacked the campaigning vigour required. The naming of the new body was symbolic: British referred to the campaign for a museum of British Antiquities, Archaeological differentiated their field from older antiquarian methods and Association had reformist, even revolutionary, overtones. Smith became its first secretary and arranged the first six annual congresses. Although he remained one of the secretaries until 1851, he had effectively resigned the post in 1849.

One of the aims of the association was to promote dialogue between self-identified experts and local archaeologists, to be achieved through the organization of an annual congress, along the model of the French Congres Archaeologique or the annual meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The first meeting was held in Canterbury in 1844. The site, with its magnificent cathedral, had obvious appeal and was close to the seat of the association’s first president, Lord Albert Conyngham (1805-1860). The Canterbury Congress occasioned the dispute which led to a split and the formation of the Archæological Institute (AI). The public reason for the feud was the publication by Thomas Wright of &quot;The Archæological Album, or, Museum of National Antiquities&quot; (1845), a commercial publication from which Wright drew profit. This infuriated Oxford publisher John Henry Parker, who was to have been the publisher of the official proceedings. Behind the scenes, however, the dispute had other dimensions, both social (all the founders of the BAA were &#x27;trade&#x27;, the seceding members of the AI considered themselves to be socially superior) and religious (the &quot;Oxford Chronicle&quot; of 16 August 1845 suggested that the dispute had acquired Tractarian/anti-Tractarian overtones).

The nineteenth-century passion for archaeology meant that both the BAA and the AI (later the Royal Archaeological Institute) flourished, although the earlier society retained the reputation for enthusiasm rather than elegance. In 1905, however, the BAA had reached a low ebb. The congress, held in Bath, made no money, the journal was delayed and many members were in arrears. The custom had emerged of electing as president a dignitary from the locality in which the next Congress was to take place. In 1905, the mayor of Reading was elected, to preside over a Congress in the same town. However, by the time the Congress took place, local landowner and former High Sheriff of Berkshire, Charles Edward Keyser, had become president. Keyser remained resident until his death in 1929.

From 1945 until 1951, Rose Graham, a religious historian, served as its first female president.

The annual conference was revived in 1975, with the first of the new series being held in Worcester. Since then, the association has held an annual conference at a centre of established importance in the mediaeval period, usually in the British Isles and occasionally in mainland Europe, collating the results of recent research on major cathedrals, minsters and abbeys and including visits to places of relevant interest. The conference proceedings are published as the &quot;British Archaeological Association Conference Transactions&quot;.

The association&#x27;s annual publication is The Journal of the British Archaeological Association.

<doc id="762950" wikidata="Q1370704" url="?curid=762950" title="VisualAge">
<text>VisualAge is a family of computer integrated development environments from IBM, which supports multiple programming languages. VisualAge was first released in October 1993. It was discontinued on April 30, 2007, and its web page was removed in September 2011. VisualAge was also marketed as VisualAge Smalltalk, and in 2005, Instantiations, Inc. acquired the worldwide rights to this product. IBM has stated that XL C/C++ is the followup product to VisualAge.

==Early history==
VisualAge was created in the IBM development lab in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which was established in 1984 and had responsibility for application development tools. The EZ-VU dialog manager product, a personal computer derivative of the user interface elements of the ISPF 327x product was one of the first products in this family. The lab also had a group which was one of the early adopters of object-oriented programming technologies within IBM using an internally developed language called ClassC to develop applications with more sophisticated graphical user interfaces which were just starting to be widely available.

Eventually, the availability of usable implementations of Smalltalk for IBM PC-AT class machines allowed IBM advanced technology projects to experiment with Smalltalk. At about the same time, visual interface construction tools were coming up on the radar screens. Smalltalk research projects such as InterCons by David N. Smith of IBM, and Fabrik by a team at Apple led by Dan Ingalls were building interactive graphical applications built from composition of graphical primitives. Higher level construction of user interfaces was evidenced by other tools such as Jean-Marie Hullot&#x27;s interface builder first done in Lisp and then evolved to become the Interface Builder tool in NeXTStep and Mac OS X. Such tools allow for building user interfaces by WYSIWYG composition of UI widgets which can be &quot;wired&quot; to each other and to application logic written in the system&#x27;s native object oriented language, or possibly with no coding at all.

The original prototype which led to VisualAge was an attempt &quot;to make something like the NeXT interface builder&quot; within the Smalltalk/V development environment. By the time VisualAge was released as a product, much more emphasis was placed on visual construction of application logic as well as of the user interface. This emphasis was in part due to the &quot;positioning&quot; for &quot;strategic&quot; reasons of Smalltalk as a generator rather than a language within IBM&#x27;s Systems Application Architecture.

===VisualAge===
The name &quot;VisualAge&quot; is the result of a contest between the members of the development team. After the initial release of VisualAge/Smalltalk the name VisualAge became a brand of its own and VisualAges were produced for several different combinations of languages and platforms.

This is the eventual total of supported languages, variously available depending on the platform: BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, EGL, Fortran, Java, Pacbase, PL/I, IBM RPG, and Smalltalk. 

This is the eventual total of supported platforms, each of which support different languages: AIX, OS/2, i5/OS (formerly named OS/400), Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, TPF, z/VM, z/OS (formerly named OS/390, MVS), and z/VSE.

In 1992, Apple and IBM cofounded Taligent, based upon Pink, an operating system with a mass of sophisticated object-oriented compiler and application framework technology from Apple. Pink became CommonPoint, the partnership was dissolved, and CommonPoint was absorbed into VisualAge starting with the Compound Document Framework to handle OLE objects in VisualAge C++ 3.5 for Windows. In February 1997, the first mass release of Taligent technology came in the form of the Open Class within VisualAge C++ 4.0. This bundled SDK adaptation includes CommonPoint&#x27;s frameworks for desktop (infrastructure for building unified OCX or OpenDoc components), web (called WebRunner, for making drag-and-drop compound documents for the web, and server CGIs), graphics for 2D GUI, international text for Unicode, filesystems, printing, and unit tests. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said &quot;Now, the best of the CommonPoint technology is being channeled into Open Class for VisualAge. ... For sheer breadth of features, the Taligent frameworks are unmatched. An all-encompassing OOP framework has always proved a difficult ideal to realize, but VisualAge&#x27;s Open Class Technology Preview is by far the most credible attempt we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;.

Most of the members of the VisualAge family were written in Smalltalk no matter which language they supported for development. The IBM implementation of Smalltalk was produced by Object Technology International which was acquired by IBM and run as a wholly owned subsidiary for several years before being absorbed into the overall IBM organization.

VisualAge for Java is based on an extended Smalltalk virtual machine which executes both Smalltalk and Java byte codes. Java natives were actually implemented in Smalltalk.

VisualAge Micro Edition, which supports development of embedded Java applications and cross system development, is a reimplementation of the IDE in Java. This version of VisualAge morphed into the Eclipse Framework.

Various members of the family have been replaced by products in the WebSphere Studio family of products. By 2005, Smalltalk specialist Instantiations, Inc. had assumed technical support responsibilities and been granted global rights to the IBM VisualAge Smalltalk product line and technology base. Instantiations continues to offer the “enhanced product” named VA Smalltalk (VAST Platform). The C, C++ and Fortran compiler on AIX, Linux and z/OS are renamed as XL C/C++ series.

<text>Central College is a private college in Pella, Iowa, United States. Affiliated with the Reformed Church in America, the college was founded in 1853 and has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission or its predecessor since 1942. Central has a student body of approximately 1,100 undergraduates. and more than 70 academic programs.

==History==

The Baptist Convention of Iowa founded Central University of Iowa in 1853 and it officially opened on October 8, 1854. The first class totaled 37 people. Central was a Baptist institution until 1916, when it was transferred to the control of the Reformed Church in America. Since 1886, Iowa Baptists had shifted their post-secondary education interests to Des Moines College, and hoped to reduce Central to a feeder school.

The college was called Central University of Iowa (CUI), at least until 1991. It was renamed &quot;Central College&quot; in 1994.

It was home to local radio station 89.1 KCUI-FM and the award-winning newspaper “The Ray.”

Central has a history of interesting architectural features. The first buildings of the new college in 1853 were Dutch Colonial and part of what was recently known as Strawtown Inn. The first dormitory, Cotton Hall, is noted for its ornate Victorian porch and stained glass windows. Building innovation continues with the addition of &quot;green&quot; buildings.

In September 2019 it was announced that Central College would lower their yearly tuition starting in the Fall 2020 semester, dropping to $18,600, from $38,600.

==Campus==
Central College&#x27;s campus is a few blocks from Pella&#x27;s downtown square, two minutes from Iowa&#x27;s largest lake and 40 minutes from Des Moines. Pella&#x27;s annual Tulip Festival attracts more than 100,000 visitors each spring. Central is a residential campus where students can live in residence halls, townhouses, and apartment style &quot;green pods.&quot;

The college&#x27;s emphasis on sustainability has led to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ratings from the U.S. Green Building Council. The Vermeer Science Center was Iowa&#x27;s first LEED-rated building, and Howard McKee Hall received the first gold rating in the state. The newest building, Roe Center, received a platinum rating.

=== Major buildings ===
Maytag Student Center—During the summer of 2014, the student center underwent a $3.1 million renovation to Maytag Student Center made possible by the Fred Maytag Family foundation. The renovations include a new workout facility, a new Student Activity Center and additional Fred&#x27;s dining area.

The Roe Center—Named after Central&#x27;s 20th president, Dr. David H. Roe, was completed in the fall of 2009. The $17 million facility houses the education and psychology departments, as well as Community-Based Learning. Central College was awarded a platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) for the design of the Roe Center. The facility features environmentally friendly building practices and an energy efficient building design, such as a green roof, natural ventilating system, radiant floor heating/cooling system and daylight harvesting systems.

Vermeer Science Center—Underwent a $20 million renovation in 2003, and was the first building in the state of Iowa and the first science building in the nation to be recognized as a green building by the U.S. Green Building Council. It was subsequently awarded a silver LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating. The mathematics, computer science, physics, biology and chemistry departments are located in the building. Vermeer features many study spaces and quiet tables located outside professors’ offices that encourage student/faculty interaction.

Weller Center for Business and International Studies—Built in 1999, it was Central&#x27;s first step in green building featuring natural light, solar panels and carpet made of recycled materials in every room. It contains the business, foreign language, international studies and communication studies departments.

Kuyper Fieldhouse houses a 200-meter track and five tennis courts. The surface is Mondotrack, which is the same surface used in the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing.

<text>In geometry, a barycentric coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the location of a point is specified by reference to a simplex (a triangle for points in a plane, a tetrahedron for points in three-dimensional space, etc.). The barycentric coordinates of a point can be interpreted as masses placed at the vertices of the simplex, such that the point is the center of mass (or &quot;barycenter&quot;) of these masses. These masses can be zero or negative; they are all positive if and only if the point is inside the simplex.

Every point has barycentric coordinates, and their sum is never zero. Two tuples of barycentric coordinates specify the same point if and only if they are proportional; that is to say, if one tuple can be obtained by multiplying the elements of the other tuple by the same non-zero number. Therefore, barycentric coordinates are either considered to be defined up to multiplication by a nonzero constant, or normalized for summing to unity.

Barycentric coordinates were introduced by August Möbius in 1827. They are special homogeneous coordinates. Barycentric coordinates are strongly related with Cartesian coordinates and, more generally, to affine coordinates (see ).

Barycentric coordinates are particularly useful in triangle geometry for studying properties that do not depend on the angles of the triangle, such as Ceva&#x27;s theorem, Routh&#x27;s theorem, and Menelaus&#x27;s theorem. In computer-aided design, they are useful for defining some kinds of Bézier surfaces.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be points in a Euclidean space, a flat or an affine space formula_2 of dimension that are affinely independent; this means that there is no affine subspace of dimension that contains all the points, or, equivalently that the points define a simplex. Given any point formula_3 there are scalars formula_4 that are not all zero, such that 
formula_5
for any point . (As usual, the notation formula_6 represents the translation vector or free vector that maps the point to the point .)

The elements of a tuple formula_7 that satisfies this equation are called &quot;barycentric coordinates&quot; of with respect to formula_8 The use of colons in the notation of the tuple means that barycentric coordinates are a sort of homogeneous coordinates, that is, the point is not changed if all coordinates are multiplied by the same nonzero constant. Moreover, the barycentric coordinates are also not changed if the auxiliary point , the origin, is changed.

The barycentric coordinates of a point are unique up to a scaling. That is, two tuples formula_7 and formula_10 are barycentric coordinates of the same point if and only if there is a nonzero scalar formula_11 such that formula_12 for every .

In some contexts, it is useful to constrain the barycentric coordinates of a point so that they are unique. This is usually achieved by imposing the condition
formula_13 
or equivalently by dividing every formula_14 by the sum of all formula_15 These specific barycentric coordinates are called normalized or absolute barycentric coordinates. Sometimes, they are also called affine coordinates, although this term refers commonly to a slightly different concept.

Sometimes, it is the normalized barycentric coordinates that are called &quot;barycentric coordinates&quot;. In this case the above defined coordinates are called &quot;homogeneous barycentric coordinates&quot;.

With above notation, the homogeneous barycentric coordinates of are all zero, except the one of index . When working over the real numbers (the above definition is also used for affine spaces over an arbitrary field), the points whose all normalized barycentric coordinates are nonnegative form the convex hull of formula_16 which is the simplex that has these points as its vertices.

With above notation, a tuple formula_17 such that
formula_18
does not define any point, but the vector 
formula_19
is independent from the origin . As the direction of this vector is not changed if all formula_14 are multiplied by the same scalar, the homogeneous tuple formula_7 defines a direction of lines, that is a point at infinity. See below for more details.

==Relationship with Cartesian or affine coordinates==
Barycentric coordinates are strongly related to Cartesian coordinates and, more generally, affine coordinates. For a space of dimension , these coordinate systems are defined relative to a point , the origin, whose coordinates are zero, and points formula_22 whose coordinates are zero except that of index that equals one.

A point has coordinates 
formula_23 
for such a coordinate system if and only if its normalized barycentric coordinates are
formula_24
relatively to the points formula_25

The main advantage of barycentric coordinate systems is to be symmetric with respect to the defining points. They are therefore often useful for studying properties that are symmetric with respect to points. On the other hand, distances and angles are difficult to express in general barycentric coordinate systems, and when they are involved, it is generally simpler to use a Cartesian coordinate system.

==Relationship with projective coordinates==
Homogeneous barycentric coordinates are also strongly related with some projective coordinates. However this relationship is more subtle than in the case of affine coordinates, and, for being clearly understood, requires a coordinate-free definition of the projective completion of an affine space, and a definition of a projective frame.

The &quot;projective completion&quot; of an affine space of dimension is a projective space of the same dimension that contains the affine space as the complement of a hyperplane. The projective completion is unique up to an isomorphism. The hyperplane is called the hyperplane at infinity, and its points are the points at infinity of the affine space.

Given a projective space of dimension , a &quot;projective frame&quot; is an ordered set of points that are not contained in the same hyperplane. A projective frame defines a projective coordinate system such that the coordinates of the th point of the frame are all equal, and, otherwise, all coordinates of the th point are zero, except the th one.

When constructing the projective completion from an affine coordinate system, one commonly defines it with respect to a projective frame consisting of the intersections with the hyperplane at infinity of the coordinate axes, the origin of the affine space, and the point that has all its affine coordinates equal to one. This implies that the points at infinity have their last coordinate equal to zero, and that the projective coordinates of a point of the affine space are obtained by completing its affine coordinates by one as th coordinate.

When one has points in an affine space that define a barycentric coordinate system, this is another projective frame of the projective completion that is convenient to choose. This frame consists of these points and their centroid, that is the point that has all its barycentric coordinates equal. In this case, the homogeneous barycentric coordinates of a point in the affine space are the same as the projective coordinates of this point. A point is at infinity if and only if the sum of its coordinates is zero. This point is in the direction of the vector defined at the end of .

==Barycentric coordinates on triangles==
In the context of a triangle, barycentric coordinates are also known as area coordinates or areal coordinates, because the coordinates of &quot;P&quot; with respect to triangle &quot;ABC&quot; are equivalent to the (signed) ratios of the areas of &quot;PBC&quot;, &quot;PCA&quot; and &quot;PAB&quot; to the area of the reference triangle &quot;ABC&quot;. Areal and trilinear coordinates are used for similar purposes in geometry.

Barycentric or areal coordinates are extremely useful in engineering applications involving triangular subdomains. These make analytic integrals often easier to evaluate, and Gaussian quadrature tables are often presented in terms of area coordinates.

Consider a triangle formula_26 with vertices formula_27, formula_28, formula_29 in the x,y-plane, formula_30. One may regard points in formula_30 as vectors, so it makes sense to add or subtract them and multiply them by scalars. 

Each triangle formula_26 has a &quot;signed area&quot; or &quot;sarea&quot;, which is plus or minus its area:
 formula_33
The sign is plus if the path from formula_34 to formula_35 to formula_36 then back to formula_34 goes around the triangle in a counterclockwise direction. The sign is minus if the path goes around in a clockwise direction. 

Let formula_38 be a point in the plane, and let formula_39 be its &quot;normalized barycentric coordinates&quot; with respect to the triangle formula_26, so 
 formula_41
and 
 formula_42 
Normalized barycentric coordinates formula_39 are also called &quot;areal coordinates&quot; because they represent ratios of signed areas of triangles:

 formula_44

One may prove these ratio formulas based on the facts that a triangle is half of a parallelogram, and the area of a parallelogram is easy to compute using a determinant. 

Specifically, let
 formula_45
formula_46 is a parallelogram because its pairs of opposite sides, represented by the pairs of displacement vectors formula_47, and formula_48, are parallel and congruent. 

Triangle formula_26 is half of the parallelogram formula_50, so twice its signed area is equal to the signed area of the parallelogram, which is given by the formula_51 determinant formula_52 whose &quot;columns&quot; are the displacement vectors formula_53 and formula_54: 
 formula_55

Expanding the determinant, using its &quot;alternating&quot; and &quot;multilinear&quot; properties, one obtains
 formula_56
so 
 formula_57
Similarly,
 formula_58,
To obtain the ratio of these signed areas, express formula_38 in the second formula in terms of its barycentric coordinates:
 formula_60
The barycentric coordinates are normalized so formula_61, hence formula_62 . Plug that into the previous line to obtain
 formula_63
Therefore
 formula_64.
Similar calculations prove the other two formulas
 formula_65
 formula_66.
Trilinear coordinates formula_67 of formula_38 are signed distances from formula_38 to the lines BC, AC, and AB, respectively. The sign of formula_70 is positive if formula_38 and formula_34 lie on the same side of BC, negative otherwise. The signs of formula_73 and formula_74 are assigned similarly. Let
 formula_75, formula_76, formula_77. 
Then
 formula_78
where, as above, sarea stands for signed area. All three signs are plus if triangle ABC is positively oriented, minus otherwise. The relations between trilinear and barycentric coordinates are obtained by substituting these formulas into the above formulas that express barycentric coordinates as ratios of areas. 

Switching back and forth between the barycentric coordinates and other coordinate systems makes some problems much easier to solve.

=== Conversion between barycentric and Cartesian coordinates ===

==== Edge approach ====
Given a point formula_79 in a triangle&#x27;s plane one can obtain the barycentric coordinates formula_80, formula_81 and formula_82 from the Cartesian coordinates formula_83 or vice versa.

We can write the Cartesian coordinates of the point formula_79 in terms of the Cartesian components of the triangle vertices formula_85, formula_86, formula_87 where formula_88 and in terms of the barycentric coordinates of formula_79 as

formula_90

That is, the Cartesian coordinates of any point are a weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of the triangle&#x27;s vertices, with the weights being the point&#x27;s barycentric coordinates summing to unity.

To find the reverse transformation, from Cartesian coordinates to barycentric coordinates, we first substitute formula_91 into the above to obtain

formula_92

Rearranging, this is

formula_93

This linear transformation may be written more succinctly as

formula_94

where formula_11 is the vector of the first two barycentric coordinates, formula_79 is the vector of Cartesian coordinates, and formula_97 is a matrix given by

formula_98

Now the matrix formula_97 is invertible, since formula_100 and formula_101 are linearly independent (if this were not the case, then formula_85, formula_86, and formula_87 would be collinear and would not form a triangle). Thus, we can rearrange the above equation to get

formula_105

Finding the barycentric coordinates has thus been reduced to finding the 2×2 inverse matrix of formula_97, an easy problem.

Explicitly, the formulae for the barycentric coordinates of point formula_79 in terms of its Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x, y&quot;) and in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the triangle&#x27;s vertices are:

formula_108When understanding the last line of equation, note the identity formula_109.

==== Vertex approach ====
Another way to solve the conversion from Cartesian to barycentric coordinates is to write the relation in the matrix form formula_110with formula_111 and formula_112 i.e.formula_113To get the unique normalized solution we need to add the condition formula_114. The barycentric coordinates are thus the solution of the linear systemformula_115which isformula_116where formula_117is twice the signed area of the triangle. The area interpretation of the barycentric coordinates can be recovered by applying Cramer&#x27;s rule to this linear system.

===Conversion between barycentric and trilinear coordinates===
A point with trilinear coordinates &quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : &quot;z&quot; has barycentric coordinates &quot;ax&quot; : &quot;by&quot; : &quot;cz&quot; where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; are the side lengths of the triangle. Conversely, a point with barycentrics formula_118 has trilinears formula_119

===Equations in barycentric coordinates===

The three sides &quot;a, b, c&quot; respectively have equations

formula_120

The equation of a triangle&#x27;s Euler line is

formula_121

Using the previously given conversion between barycentric and trilinear coordinates, the various other equations given in Trilinear coordinates#Formulas can be rewritten in terms of barycentric coordinates.

===Distance between points===
The displacement vector of two normalized points formula_122 and formula_123 is

formula_124

The distance between and , or the length of the displacement vector formula_125 is

formula_126

where &quot;a, b, c&quot; are the sidelengths of the triangle. The equivalence of the last two expressions follows from formula_127 which holds because 
formula_128

The barycentric coordinates of a point can be calculated based on distances &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; to the three triangle vertices by solving the equation
formula_129

=== Applications===
====Determining location with respect to a triangle ====
Although barycentric coordinates are most commonly used to handle points inside a triangle, they can also be used to describe a point outside the triangle. If the point is not inside the triangle, then we can still use the formulas above to compute the barycentric coordinates. However, since the point is outside the triangle, at least one of the coordinates will violate our original assumption that formula_130. In fact, given any point in cartesian coordinates, we can use this fact to determine where this point is with respect to a triangle.

If a point lies in the interior of the triangle, all of the Barycentric coordinates lie in the open interval formula_131 If a point lies on an edge of the triangle but not at a vertex, one of the area coordinates formula_132 (the one associated with the opposite vertex) is zero, while the other two lie in the open interval formula_131 If the point lies on a vertex, the coordinate associated with that vertex equals 1 and the others equal zero. Finally, if the point lies outside the triangle at least one coordinate is negative.

Summarizing,
:Point formula_79 lies inside the triangle if and only if formula_135.
formula_136 lies on the edge or corner of the triangle if formula_137 and formula_138.

:Otherwise, formula_79 lies outside the triangle.

In particular, if a point lies on the far side of a line the barycentric coordinate of the point in the triangle that is not on the line will have a negative value.

====Interpolation on a triangular unstructured grid ====

If formula_140 are known quantities, but the values of inside the triangle defined by formula_141 is unknown, they can be approximated using linear interpolation. Barycentric coordinates provide a convenient way to compute this interpolation. If formula_79 is a point inside the triangle with barycentric coordinates formula_80, formula_81, formula_82, then

formula_146

In general, given any unstructured grid or polygon mesh, this kind of technique can be used to approximate the value of at all points, as long as the function&#x27;s value is known at all vertices of the mesh. In this case, we have many triangles, each corresponding to a different part of the space. To interpolate a function at a point formula_79, first a triangle must be found that contains formula_79. To do so, formula_79 is transformed into the barycentric coordinates of each triangle. If some triangle is found such that the coordinates satisfy formula_150, then the point lies in that triangle or on its edge (explained in the previous section). Then the value of formula_151 can be interpolated as described above.

These methods have many applications, such as the finite element method (FEM).

====Integration over a triangle or tetrahedron ====

The integral of a function over the domain of the triangle can be annoying to compute in a cartesian coordinate system. One generally has to split the triangle up into two halves, and great messiness follows. Instead, it is often easier to make a change of variables to any two barycentric coordinates, e.g. formula_152. Under this change of variables,

formula_153

where is the area of the triangle. This result follows from the fact that a rectangle in barycentric coordinates corresponds to a quadrilateral in cartesian coordinates, and the ratio of the areas of the corresponding shapes in the corresponding coordinate systems is given by formula_154. Similarly, for integration over a tetrahedron, instead of breaking up the integral into two or three separate pieces, one could switch to 3D tetrahedral coordinates under the change of variables

formula_155where is the volume of the tetrahedron.

===Examples of special points===
In the homogeneous barycentric coordinate system defined with respect to a triangle formula_26, the following statements about special points of formula_26 hold.

The three vertices , , and have coordinates

formula_158

The centroid has coordinates formula_159

If , , are the edge lengths formula_160, formula_161, formula_162 respectively, formula_163, formula_164, formula_165 are the angle measures formula_166, formula_167, and formula_168 respectively, and is the semiperimeter of formula_26, then the following statements about special points of formula_26 hold in addition.

The circumcenter has coordinates

formula_171

The orthocenter has coordinates

formula_172

The incenter has coordinates formula_173

The excenters have coordinates

formula_174

The nine-point center has coordinates

formula_175

The Gergonne point has coordinates formula_176.

The Nagel point has coordinates formula_177.

The symmedian point has coordinates formula_178.

==Barycentric coordinates on tetrahedra==

Barycentric coordinates may be easily extended to three dimensions. The 3D simplex is a tetrahedron, a polyhedron having four triangular faces and four vertices. Once again, the four barycentric coordinates are defined so that the first vertex formula_85 maps to barycentric coordinates formula_180, formula_181, etc.

This is again a linear transformation, and we may extend the above procedure for triangles to find the barycentric coordinates of a point formula_79 with respect to a tetrahedron:

formula_183

where formula_97 is now a 3×3 matrix:

formula_185

and formula_186with the corresponding Cartesian coordinates:formula_187Once again, the problem of finding the barycentric coordinates has been reduced to inverting a 3×3 matrix.

3D barycentric coordinates may be used to decide if a point lies inside a tetrahedral volume, and to interpolate a function within a tetrahedral mesh, in an analogous manner to the 2D procedure. Tetrahedral meshes are often used in finite element analysis because the use of barycentric coordinates can greatly simplify 3D interpolation.

== Generalized barycentric coordinates ==
Barycentric coordinates formula_188 of a point formula_189 that are defined with respect to a finite set of &quot;k&quot; points formula_190 instead of a simplex are called generalized barycentric coordinates. For these, the equation

formula_191

is still required to hold. Usually one uses normalized coordinates, formula_192. As for the case of a simplex, the points with nonnegative normalized generalized coordinates (formula_193) form the convex hull of . If there are more points than in a full simplex (formula_194) the generalized barycentric coordinates of a point are &quot;not&quot; unique, as the defining linear system (here for n=2)formula_195is underdetermined. The simplest example is a quadrilateral in the plane. Various kinds of additional restrictions can be used to define unique barycentric coordinates.

=== Abstraction ===
More abstractly, generalized barycentric coordinates express a convex polytope with &quot;n&quot; vertices, regardless of dimension, as the &quot;image&quot; of the standard formula_196-simplex, which has &quot;n&quot; vertices – the map is onto: formula_197 The map is one-to-one if and only if the polytope is a simplex, in which case the map is an isomorphism; this corresponds to a point not having &quot;unique&quot; generalized barycentric coordinates except when P is a simplex.

Dual to generalized barycentric coordinates are slack variables, which measure by how much margin a point satisfies the linear constraints, and gives an embedding formula_198 into the &quot;f&quot;-orthant, where &quot;f&quot; is the number of faces (dual to the vertices). This map is one-to-one (slack variables are uniquely determined) but not onto (not all combinations can be realized).

This use of the standard formula_196-simplex and &quot;f&quot;-orthant as standard objects that map to a polytope or that a polytope maps into should be contrasted with the use of the standard vector space formula_200 as the standard object for vector spaces, and the standard affine hyperplane formula_201 as the standard object for affine spaces, where in each case choosing a linear basis or affine basis provides an &quot;isomorphism,&quot; allowing all vector spaces and affine spaces to be thought of in terms of these standard spaces, rather than an onto or one-to-one map (not every polytope is a simplex). Further, the &quot;n&quot;-orthant is the standard object that maps &quot;to&quot; cones.

=== Applications ===

Generalized barycentric coordinates have applications in computer graphics and more specifically in geometric modelling. Often, a three-dimensional model can be approximated by a polyhedron such that the generalized barycentric coordinates with respect to that polyhedron have a geometric meaning. In this way, the processing of the model can be simplified by using these meaningful coordinates. Barycentric coordinates are also used in geophysics.

<text>Lost River begins and ends in a closed basin in northern California and southern Oregon in the United States. The river, long, flows in an arc from Clear Lake Reservoir in Modoc County, California, through Klamath County, Oregon, to Tule Lake in Siskiyou County, California. About of Lost River are in Oregon, and are in California.
== Course ==
From its source, the river flows into Langell Valley, where Miller Creek enters from the . Near Bonanza, the river turns west and passes through Olene Gap, about east of Klamath Falls. The river then turns southeast and flows along the base of Stukel Mountain, where it provides diversion canals for small lakes including Nuss Lake for irrigation and flood control. It then re-enters California south of Merrill.

Dams, canals, pumps, and other artificial structures on the Lost River, Clear Lake, and Tule Lake are part of the Klamath Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the basin&#x27;s water flow mainly for farming and flood control. The project provides water to about of cropland, 62% of which are in Oregon and 38% in California. Water from the Lost River basin is diverted to the Klamath River basin, mainly through the Lost River Diversion Channel, about downstream of Olene. The channel can also supply water by reverse flow from the Klamath when irrigation water is needed for farms in drained parts of Tule Lake.

== History ==
After 1846, the Applegate Trail crossed the river on a natural bridge of stepping-stones, later covered by a Bureau of Reclamation dam, near Merrill. Earlier in that year, explorer John C. Frémont had named the stream McCrady River after a boyhood friend, but over time the Lost River name prevailed. A Lost River post office operated briefly, probably in the vicinity of Olene, in 1875–76.

== Fishing ==
A sluggish stream, Lost River offers fishing opportunities for bass, up to , brown bullhead, crappie, yellow perch, and Sacramento perch. Trout are uncommon in this river.

<text>Sarah Connor (born Sarah Marianne Corina Lewe; 13 June 1980) is a German pop singer. She rose to prominence after she signed with X-Cell Records in 2000 and released her debut album &quot;Green Eyed Soul&quot; (2001) the following year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including &quot;Unbelievable&quot; (2002), &quot;Key to My Soul&quot; (2003), &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot; (2005), &quot;Christmas in My Heart&quot; (2005), &quot;Soulicious&quot; (2007), &quot;Sexy as Hell&quot; (2008) and &quot;Real Love&quot; (2010). Several songs from these albums became hit singles on the pop record charts, including the number-one hits &quot;From Sarah with Love&quot;, &quot;Music is the Key&quot;, &quot;Just One Last Dance&quot;, &quot;Living to Love You&quot; and &quot;From Zero to Hero&quot;. In 2015, Connor&#x27;s first German language project &quot;Muttersprache&quot; became her second chart-topper after a decade.

Her popularity was further enhanced by the ProSieben reality television series &quot;Sarah &amp; Marc in Love&quot; (2005) and &quot;Sarah &amp; Marc Crazy in Love&quot; (2008) alongside her then-husband Marc Terenzi, chronicling their marriage and careers. In 2010, she returned to television to become a judge on the debut season of the German &quot;X Factor&quot; adaptation of which she remained part for two further seasons. In 2014, she joined the cast of the debut season of &quot;Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of the series &quot;The Best Singers&quot; whose accompanying compilation album topped the Austrian and German Albums Chart. The following year, she served as a guest coach on the RTL II remake of the talent series &quot;Popstars 2015&quot;.

Connor has sold seven million albums worldwide and is recognized as one of the most successful German vocalists to emerge in the 2000s. According to GfK Entertainment, she is the first recording act to ever have scored four consecutive chart-topping hits on the German Singles Chart. In 2017, Deutsche Welle ranked her third on its list of the top ten German solo acts who have enjoyed international success. A 13-time nominee, Connor won two Echo Music Prize and has been the recipient of four Comets, a Top of the Pops Award, a Goldene Kamera, a Goldene Europa, and a World Music Award. Separated from Terenzi, father of her first two children, Connor has been in a relationship with her manager Florian Fischer since 2010. The couple have another two children of their own.

== Early life ==
Connor is the eldest of six siblings born to Michael Lewe, a copywriter from New Orleans, and his wife Soraya Lewe-Tacke (&quot;née&quot; Gray), a former fashion model and homemaker of Scottish, Irish, and German descent, in Hamburg. She has four sisters, including Anna-Maria Lagerblom, the wife of German rapper Bushido, as well as Marisa, Sophia-Luisa, and Valentina; and one brother, Robin. Her maternal half-brothers Mick and Lex were born in 2008, Connor grew up listening to soul music, mostly-influenced by her paternal grandfather, a former jazz and R&amp;B pianist from New Orleans. A church choir provided her with her first experience in gospel music at the age of six. In 1989, the family relocated from Hamburg to Delmenhorst, where Connor attended the Max-Planck-Gymnasium (high school). She also enrolled at the local performing arts school, where she received dancing, singing, and acting lessons, which she paid for through waitressing and modelling jobs. After dropping out of school, she completed an internship with RTL Television.

In 1997, Connor and her sister Anna-Maria were picked to sing with the backing choir during the performances of &quot;Earth Song&quot; and &quot;Heal the World&quot; at Michael Jackson&#x27;s HIStory World Tour in Bremen, Germany. Overwhelmed by a personal meeting with Jackson at the end of the show, she began to record a number of demo tapes under the pseudonym &quot;Sarah Gray&quot;, including cover versions such as &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;This Christmas&quot; as well as the local radio success &quot;Ula la Ula&quot;. In 1998, her boyfriend Martin Scholz, member of the boy band Touché, arranged for Connor to sign a management deal with the group&#x27;s manager. She subsequently served as their opening act for a Bremen concert in July 1998. Unhappy with her management though, Connor transitioned to the manager Carlo Vista and began work on the single &quot;This Christmas&quot; with the producers Oliver Hintz and Thomas Nöhre. It was released through Villa Records in 1999. Also that year, she provided the leading vocals for the German producer Marc van Linden&#x27;s trance remix of the 1982 record &quot;Last Unicorn&quot;, which reached number eighty-six on the German singles chart. In 2000, music manager George Glueck eventually signed her as &quot;Sarah Connor&quot; with the Sony subsidiary X-Cell Records. Her stage name was chosen to capitalize on the popularity of the movie The Terminator

== Career ==
=== 2001–2003: Breakthrough with &quot;From Sarah with Love&quot; ===
Connor fluctuated between Berlin, Hamburg, and Hanover to work on her R&amp;B and hip hop-driven debut album, involving German music producers Bülent Aris, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar as well as international collaborators such as Eddie Martin and rapper TQ. Its release was preceded by the top five and top 20 hit singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Back to Bed – Boy!&quot; and &quot;French Kissing&quot;, respectively, as well as her breakthrough hit, the ballad &quot;From Sarah with Love&quot;, which reached the top position in Germany, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland and raised Connor&#x27;s fame all over Europe. Eventually released in November 2001, &quot;Green Eyed Soul&quot; generally had mixed reception from music critics, who declared it a mixed bag but considered it a solid career launcher. The album debuted at number two on the German albums chart, and charted within the top five in Austria, Finland and Switzerland, reaching gold status in Austria, Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland, while earning platinum certifications in Finland and Germany. Connor was subsequently awarded a Goldene Europa and won the Echo Music Prize for Best National Rock/Pop Female Artist, among three nominations.

 The following year, Connor embarked on the Green Eyed Soul Tour in 2002 and began production on her second studio album &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. A continuation of &quot;Green Eyed Soul&quot;, she reteamed with Aris, Denar and Tyger to work on the majority of the album, with American musicians Wyclef Jean, Jerry Duplessis, and Diane Warren also joining the project. Jean wrote, produced and rapped on the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;One Nite Stand (of Wolves and Sheep)&quot;, which once again entered the top 5. &quot;Unbelievable&quot; simultaneously achieved gold status in Germany within 48 hours and spawned another three singles, including &quot;Skin on Skin&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Unbelievable&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot;.

In October 2003, Connor released a live DVD branded &quot;Sarah Connor Live – A Night to Remember: Pop Meets Classic&quot;, whose performance had been recorded at the Alten Kasselhaus in Düsseldorf on 24 January, including individual performances of own songs with a classical orchestra backing her up. In November 2003, in spite of being heavily pregnant with her first child, Connor released her third album called, &quot;Key to My Soul&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Music Is the Key&quot; featuring New York a cappella singers Naturally 7, became her second number-one hit in Germany. &quot;Just One Last Dance&quot;, the album&#x27;s second and final single, was a re-recorded edition of the album&#x27;s original version, including new vocals by Marc Terenzi&#x27;s band Natural. The duet once again reached number-one in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland and the top 20 on a composite World Top 40.

The album &quot;Sarah Connor&quot; featured the first single, &quot;Bounce&quot;. It was released in many countries, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. In Germany, the single made it to number 14 on the charts. In England and Ireland, it peaked at number 14 and was certified gold in Australia. In America, the song only managed a number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album made it to number 106 and took off in the U.S., selling almost 100.000 copies.

=== 2004–2008: International success ===
After a lengthy hiatus that saw the birth of her son Tyler, Connor returned to music in fall 2004 with the release of her single &quot;Living to Love You&quot;. The ballad reached number-one in Germany and Switzerland, becoming her third consecutive chart-topper, and preceded her fourth album &quot;Naughty But Nice&quot; (2005). Connor re-teamed with longtime contributors Booya, Kay Denar und Rob Tyger to work on the album, whose release coincided with the broadcast of her ProSieben reality series &quot;Sarah &amp; Marc in Love&quot;. Her highest-charting effort yet, &quot;Naughty But Nice&quot; debuted on top of the German Albums Chart and reached the top three in Austria and Switzerland, selling 100,000 copies within the first two days of its release. Critical reaction toward the album was generally-mixed, with Allmusic rating it three starts out of five, and &quot;laut.de&quot; summing it as &quot;underclass music for the disco around the corner&quot;. Spawning just one another single, &quot;From Zero to Hero&quot; was picked to be used as the theme song to the animated film &quot;Robots&quot; (2005),The song became her fifth chart-topping single in Germany and the fourth number-one hit single in a row.
In fall 2005, Connor embarked on the Naughty but Nice concert tour. Compiling twenty-three dates in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the tour concluded a month later. In December 2005, she released a holiday album named &quot;Christmas in My Heart&quot;. Containing a mix of traditional but contemporary English standards and re-written German songs in English language, both the album and its same-titled lead single reached number four on the charts. Eventually certified platinum by the IFPI, the album was re-released the following year, including the previously unreleased single &quot;The Best Side of Life&quot;, another top four success.

Returning from yet another hiatus after the birth of her daughter Summer in 2006, Connor released her sixth studio album &quot;Soulicious&quot; in March 2007. Mainly made up of 1960s and 70s Motown covers, but also including two original songs, recording for the entire album took place at the former main building of the Berliner Rundfunk, where Connor was backed by a symphonic orchestra of forty-eight musicians. Upon its release, the album reached the top ten in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where it each reached gold status. Critics, again, gave &quot;Soulicious&quot; a mixed response, with &quot;CDStarts.de&quot; calling it &quot;a sterile soul adaption for &quot;The Dome&quot; stage&quot;. Leading single &quot;The Impossible Dream (The Quest)&quot;, which was featured in a publicity campaign for the comeback fight of German boxer Henry Maske, and &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, a duet with American singer Ne-Yo, reached the top ten and top twenty of the singles charts respectively.

Heading into a new musical direction, Connor intensified work on her next original album with producers such as Remee, Thomas Troelsen and J. R. Rotem. In May 2008, it was announced Connor and her family would once again participate in an eight-part reality show titled &quot;Sarah and Marc: Still Crazy in Love&quot;&quot; on ProSieben. The special began airing on 3 July 2008 and followed the recording and promotional events for the new album, branded &quot;Sexy as Hell&quot;. Its first single, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, co-written by Troelsen, was released on 1 August 2008, in German-speaking Europe, with the album following on 22 August 2008. Subsequently, she was nominated for an ECHO.

=== 2009-present: &quot;X-Factor&quot;, &quot;Real Love&quot;, and &quot;Muttersprache&quot; ===

In 2009, Connor contributed to a re-recorded version of Enrique Iglesias&#x27; duet &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Love&quot;, replacing American singer Ciara&#x27;s original vocals on the song. Released as the second single from Iglesias&#x27; 2008 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in German-speaking Europe, Poland and the Czech Republic, it reached the top ten of the German singles chart. In April 2010, it was announced that Connor would appear alongside mentor George Glueck and musician Till Brönner as a judge on the debut series of &quot;X Factor&quot;, broadcast on the German VOX network. Connor was given the 16-24s category (made up of solo contestants between 16 and 24) but failed to reach the final show when her contestant Mati Gavriel was eliminated in his seventh week and Edita Abdieski was crowned the winner of &quot;X Factor&quot; instead. Amid her appearances on &quot;X Factor&quot;, Connor released her eighth studio album &quot;Real Love&quot; on 22 October 2010. It earned a lukewarm reception by critics, and debuted at number eight on the German albums chart. Altogether, &quot;Real Love&quot; produced two singles, including &quot;Cold as Ice&quot;, which reached the top twenty on the German singles chart, and its title track, both of which became her lowest-charting singles in years. Connor returned for the second and third &quot;X Factor&quot; series in 2011 and 2012 and was given the groups and over 25s categories, respectively. Again, her contestants Nica &amp; Joe and Björn Paulsen each placed third, losing to David Pfeffer and Mrs. Greenbird.

Following a hiatus, in 2014, Connor appeared in the reality television series &quot;Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of &quot;The Best Singers&quot; series. In 2015, Connor released her ninth studio album &quot;Muttersprache&quot;, her first album to be entirely recorded in German. Encouraged to record songs in her native language, following her performances on &quot;Sing meinen Song&quot;, Connor worked with a smaller range of producers on the album, including Daniel Faust, Peter Plate, and Ulf Leo Sommer. Upon its release, &quot;Muttersprache&quot; debuted on top of on the German albums chart, becoming her second number-one album following 2005&#x27;s &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot;. With first week sales of more than 100,000 copies in Germany, &quot;Muttersprache&quot; was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) just days after its release. It has since been certified platinum. The album also debuted at number-one on the Swiss Albums Chart, her first album to do so. &quot;Wie schön du bist&quot; became Connor&#x27;s highest-charting single in a decade, reaching number two on the German singles chart, and sold over 260,000 copies.

== Personal life ==
Connor met Marc Terenzi, the lead singer of American boy band Natural, at the Bravo Happy Holidays festival in Rust, Germany, in July 2002. The pair began dating, and in June 2003, it was announced they were engaged and expecting their first child, Tyler Marc Terenzi, who was born on 2 February 2004 in Orlando, Florida. The couple married the same month. They renewed their vows with a wedding ceremony in Spain in August 2005, which was the subject of their ProSieben reality show &quot;Sarah and Marc in Love&quot;. On 23 June 2006, Connor gave birth to their second child, a girl named Summer Antonia Soraya. In November 2008, Connor announced her separation from Terenzi.

In April 2010, Connor announced that she was in a relationship with her manager, Florian Fischer, the singer of the 1990s pop group The Boyz. In February 2011, the two confirmed that they were expecting a child. Their daughter Delphine Malou was born in September 2011. They welcomed their son Jax Llewyn in January 2017.

<doc id="762959" wikidata="Q496437" url="?curid=762959" title="Sarah Connor (Terminator)">
<text>Sarah Jeanette Connor is a fictional character and the female protagonist of the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise. She is one of the protagonists of &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015), and &quot;&quot; (2019), as well as the television series &quot;&quot; (2008–2009). The character develops from a timid damsel in distress victim in the first film to a wanted fugitive committing acts of terrorism, a hardened warrior and mother who sacrificed everything for her son&#x27;s future, on the verge of losing touch with her own humanity, and a mentor preparing and protecting a protégée for her destiny.

In an alternate timeline, depicted in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, she is in her younger years, raised by a Terminator, while in another alternate timeline, depicted in &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, she hunts numerous rogue Terminators (from various alternate timelines) in the years following her son&#x27;s death.

Sarah was portrayed by Linda Hamilton in &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (voice only), and &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;; she was additionally portrayed by Emilia Clarke, Willa Taylor as a younger Sarah Connor in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; and Lena Headey as an older Sarah Connor in &quot;&quot;.

==&quot;Terminator&quot; film series==
===Sarah Connor&#x27;s age===
&quot;The Terminator&quot; does not specify Sarah Connor&#x27;s age or birth date, although according to the original script (available on the Special Edition DVD), she was 19 years old. The film is set in May 1984.

In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, Sarah&#x27;s psychologist states she is 29. However, her tombstone shown in &quot;Terminator 3&quot; reads 1959–1997, which would make her several years older than what was previously established in the earlier films. In &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, Sarah was nine in 1973, placing her birth in 1963 or 1964, consistent with the original films.

In &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate,&quot; the film is set twenty-five years after the events of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, making Sarah 55 years old by the time of its events. This is further evident as the end-credits state that Sarah was 33 in the opening scene in 1998.

=== &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) ===

Sarah is a Los Angeles college student and waitress who is pursued by a relentless android assassin, the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). She learns she is in danger from a televised report of two identically named Los Angeles women who were shot to death earlier that day, including one played by Marianne Muellerleile. She is rescued from the Terminator by time-travelling soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who says that in the future, an artificial intelligence called Skynet will be created by military software developers to make strategic decisions.

The program will become self-aware, seize control of most of the world&#x27;s military hardware (including highly advanced robots), and launch an all-out attack on human beings. John Connor will eventually lead the remnants of the world&#x27;s military and survivors, The Resistance, to victory, only to discover Skynet has invented a means of time travel and sent an android killer back in time to destroy John&#x27;s mother before he is born. John is Sarah&#x27;s future son; he sends back a trusted sergeant, Kyle Reese, to protect his mother. During their brief time together, Kyle tells Sarah that she will be responsible for training John in the skills and tactics he will use to fight Skynet.

Kyle protects Sarah from the Terminator and they flee together. Initially, she is unaware that Reese has been in love with her. While they are avoiding the Terminator, Sarah grows to reciprocate his feelings, and they consummate their relationship, resulting in John&#x27;s conception. Kyle dies fighting the Terminator in a factory. Sarah crushes the Terminator in a hydraulic press. Kyle&#x27;s sincerity and courage inspire her to develop the skills and abilities that make her a suitable mentor and teacher to John. After these events, Sarah, pregnant and a fugitive, begins making a voice recording to give to John later in life. While recording the tape, a boy takes a photograph that he sells to her; John will give this to Kyle in the future before sending him back in time.

=== &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) ===
Sarah and her son John (Edward Furlong) have been separated; John is now ten years old and living in a foster home with Todd and Janelle Voight, and Sarah has been institutionalized at a prison hospital of the criminally insane. In the years since the previous film, she has become a muscled, ferocious warrior. After the death of Kyle Reese, Sarah takes his warnings and the responsibility of raising her son to heart. Her fixation on the disaster and her fanatical desire to keep John safe has made her mentally unstable and very violent, which is aggravated by her fear and hatred of the Model 101. She lives off-grid to protect herself and John. Sarah lived as an outlaw and tried to teach her son the skills he would need to lead the resistance. She is captured and sent to a psychiatric prison hospital ward (of the criminally insane) after trying to blow up a computer factory. Several times at the hospital, she has tried to improve her behavior in hope of getting to see her son, but the criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman does not believe her. Her activities and claims of fighting evil robots from the future led to her being deemed incurable.

Sarah only seemed to confirm the judgment of psychiatrists by committing acts of violence against hospital staff. She tries to escape multiple times; during her final escape attempt, Sarah encounters two Terminator models; the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a liquid metal android sent back to kill her son, and the Model 101 (Schwarzenegger) that was sent back by John&#x27;s future self (Michael Edwards) to protect them. When the Model 101 (or T-800) comes to the hospital ward with John, she flees in terror and is almost captured by the hospital staff, but she goes with the android who tells her &quot;come with me if you want to live.&quot; They escape in a police car after knocking the driver unconscious. Sarah finds it nearly impossible to accept that the Model 101 is benevolent; throughout the film she remains hostile towards it. John develops a bond with it, resembling a father-son relationship. In the director&#x27;s cut of the movie, Sarah has an opportunity to destroy the machine&#x27;s CPU. She nearly does so but John persuades her that they will need its help.

After another horrific nightmare about Judgment Day, Sarah decides to hunt down Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), a computer researcher who works at Cyberdyne Systems and is destined to build the microprocessor that will become Skynet. However, she cannot bring herself to kill a person, realizing that doing so would make her no better than a Terminator herself. Shortly afterwards, John and the Model 101 arrive; with Dyson&#x27;s help, they destroy all of his research and steal the remains of the first Terminator from the Cyberdyne lab. After the T-1000 is defeated, the Model 101 lets Sarah lower it into a vat of molten steel to destroy it, despite John&#x27;s protests. Sarah finally gains respect for the Model 101 and offers her hand in friendship before its final sacrifice. Because of this event, Sarah looks to the future with renewed hope.

====Alternate ending====
The alternate ending for &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, available on the Ultimate Edition DVD and the Skynet Edition Blu-ray, shows Sarah alive and well 30 years after the primary events of the film. She is an elderly grandmother and John is a Senator in a world in which Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.

=== &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003) ===

Sarah Connor has died from leukemia before the events of the 2003 film. She is mentioned by her son John (Nick Stahl) and the T-101 (Schwarzenegger). She lived long enough to see the 1997 &quot;Judgment Day&quot; pass without incident, and was cremated in Mexico where her ashes were spread out to the sea. Never truly believing they had beaten Skynet, her friends stored a cache of weapons in a casket for John to find in the event that Judgment Day was not averted and the Terminators returned, in accordance with her will.

=== &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009) ===

Linda Hamilton reprised her role as Sarah Connor in (voiceovers only) with warning of the future war, in the form of taped recordings for John (Christian Bale) delivered throughout &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;.

=== &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015) ===
Sarah is portrayed by Emilia Clarke. Willa Taylor, the daughter of the film&#x27;s director Alan Taylor, has a brief role as Sarah&#x27;s nine-year-old self. The story takes place in an alternate reality to the continuity of the first four films due to Skynet&#x27;s (Matt Smith) actions throughout the timeline. Therefore, Clarke&#x27;s Sarah is an alternate timeline variant of her counterpart portrayed by Hamilton.

In the film, Skynet sends a T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun) to an earlier point in Sarah&#x27;s life, in 1973, to kill her. Sarah is nine when her parents are killed by it during camping at Big Bear Lake. Sarah is found and raised by a reprogrammed T-800 (Schwarzenegger) sent by an unknown party to be her guardian after her escape. These events result in an altered timeline that erases the events of the earlier films. Clarke&#x27;s Sarah integrates elements of both Hamilton&#x27;s portrayal and Furlong&#x27;s portrayal of John in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;; young Sarah teaches the android, which she calls &quot;Pops&quot;, how to be more human and forms an emotional bond with the T-800, regarding it as a surrogate father after her parents&#x27; deaths.

After the T-1000&#x27;s attack in 1973, Sarah learns from Pops of her assailant&#x27;s motive, her destiny as John Connor&#x27;s (Jason Clarke) future mother, and the Resistance&#x27;s war against Skynet, including its first attempt on killing her in the original timeline&#x27;s 1984. Over the next decade, Pops trains Sarah to handle weapons and prepare for her destiny. However, Sarah despises her destiny and wants the ability to choose how to live her life. Because she was trained in combat since childhood, Sarah is not helpless by the time Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) arrives to protect her in 1984. In addition, she is headstrong, assertive, and audacious. Unlike her parallel from the original timeline, that being raised by a Terminator, Sarah has extensive knowledge on Skynet, even able to build a makeshift time machine with Pop, having advanced engineering skills decades ahead of her time. She is not dependent upon Kyle, but rather is fighting alongside him. Sarah initially resents her relationship with Kyle being dictated by fate, but she gradually falls in love with him. Sarah plans to time travel and destroy Skynet to prevent Judgment Day.

Discovering the date of Skynet&#x27;s initial attack has changed from 1997 to 2017, Sarah and Kyle travel 33 years into the future to stop Skynet and their alternate version of John, who had been compromised by Skynet and was changed into a cyborg known as the T-3000. After John&#x27;s defeat and the prevention of Skynet from spreading to computer servers worldwide, Sarah, Kyle and Pops prepare to face an unknown future, unaware that Skynet is now self-aware in Cyberdyne&#x27;s underground facility.

=== &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; (2019) ===

Hamilton reprises the part of Sarah Connor as the lead character in the 2019 film &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, a direct sequel to &quot;Terminator 2&quot; (thus ignoring the events of &quot;Terminator 3&quot; and &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;). In this timeline, the rise of Skynet is averted, but it dispatched various other Terminators into the past prior to its erasure from history, with the result that John was killed by another T-800 in Guatemala in 1998. Grieving and bitter, Sarah succumbs to alcoholism, and spends the intervening decades hunting down other Terminators based on anonymous texts sent by an unknown figure that direct her to the time and place that they will arrive, allowing her to eliminate them before they can pose a threat. Since the attack on Cyberdyne Systems, Sarah is wanted by the entire United States&#x27; authorities.

In 2020, the latest such message eventually leads her to the Rev-9 in Mexico City. Sarah disables the Rev-9 and rescues Daniella &quot;Dani&quot; Ramos as well as her protector, Grace, an augmented soldier and Dani&#x27;s adopted daughter from the future. Sarah learns that the Rev-9 has been sent by another A.I., Legion, to kill Dani, as she is destined to lead the human resistance against the Legion&#x27;s machines following the AI takeover, which Sarah and John merely postponed by destroying Cyberdyne Systems&#x27; technology. GPS coordinates tattooed onto Grace are revealed to match the source of Sarah&#x27;s texts, with the group&#x27;s efforts to track this source revealing that it is the T-800 that killed John. Having completed its primary mission and finding out that Skynet&#x27;s existence had been erased, it learned from humanity, formed a family and developed a form of conscience, which led it to attempt to make amends with Sarah by sending her the texts so that she could destroy the arriving Terminators and stop their technology being used to rebuild Skynet. This Terminator, now known as Carl, joins them to stop the Rev-9, though Sarah still vows to destroy him after they defeat the Rev-9 for killing John. In a final confrontation in a hydroelectric dam, the Rev-9 is destroyed but Carl and Grace are killed in the process. After Dani vows not to let Grace die again, Sarah vows to prepare her for the coming battle against Legion as she once did with John.

==&quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot; (2008–2009)==

In the television series &quot;&quot;, an alternate sequel to the first two films, Lena Headey portrays Sarah Connor. This version of Sarah is an alternate future version of her film series counterpart; her appearances in the first two &quot;Terminator&quot; films are considered part of this continuity.

===Production background===
In November 2005, 20th Century Fox announced that it would produce a television series called &quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot; featuring the adventures of the title character and her son in the years after &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. In November 2006, it announced that Headey had been chosen to play Sarah. The choice of Headey was criticized by several fans and critics, who said she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular character portrayed by Hamilton. The controversy was covered by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and an online fan group.

Series creator Josh Friedman auditioned over 300 actress for the role; he said he was looking for was someone &quot;who embodied that spirit and who was believable in that role and not just some glammed up, Hollywood, actressy thing&quot;.

After a friend recommended English actor Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape and thought she was &quot;a tough, tough woman&quot;. Having seen &quot;The Terminator&quot; when she was a teenager, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character; she said, &quot;Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it&#x27;s a very strong print that she&#x27;s left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and see it with fresh eyes&quot;. When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said, &quot;I&#x27;m playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way I would play that is someone who&#x27;s passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her ...&quot;

===Season 1===

In 1999, four years after the events of the second film (Two years in the show&#x27;s timeline), Sarah and John Connor are living undercover after being blamed for the murder of Miles Dyson and is engaged to paramedic Charley Dixon. Fearing discovery and the certainty of a stable life, they flee again. On his first day in his new school, John is attacked by a T-888 Terminator posing as a substitute teacher called Cromartie. He escapes with the help of Cameron Phillips, a Terminator that resembles a teenage girl, sent back in time by the future John to protect him. Sarah hears of the shooting and rushes to the school but is captured by Cromartie, who uses her to lure John into a trap. Again with the help of Cameron, they flee to a bank where resistance members have hidden the parts of a time machine. As Cromartie attacks them, the trio disappear into the year 2007.

Cameron suggests to Sarah their primary mission should be to stop Skynet, estimated to go online in 2011. Sarah argues against this, but Cameron tells her she would have died from cancer in 2005. The three characters try to evade discovery and find the origins of Skynet. In the third episode of the series, Sarah seeks to avoid getting cancer; she trains her body and takes vitamins and medications.

Sarah&#x27;s relationship with Cameron has been repeatedly antagonistic and they share a mutual distrust. As Sarah attempts to teach Cameron the value of a human life, Cameron argues the importance of their mission to thwart Skynet&#x27;s creation even if killing is necessary. During battles with Terminators programmed to kill the Connors, Sarah and Cameron often find themselves working together. Also, since Cameron is the only other person who knows of her cancer situation, Sarah often approaches her for advice in the matter.

In the episode &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, she discovers that her dead lover Kyle Reese has a brother named Derek, who is also a time-travelling Resistance agent. She hopes to save Derek from being killed by androids. Sarah tells John about his true identity and he seeks help from her former fiancé Charley Dixon to save his uncle&#x27;s life. Despite her knowledge of his connection to Kyle, Sarah continues to distrust Derek because she is aware that he killed Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Goode, one of the creators of Skynet. Despite their mutual distrust, there is some attraction between them.

===Season 2===
In the second season, Sarah worries about contracting and dying of cancer. She meets John&#x27;s new friend Riley Dawson, and is concerned their friendship risks the family&#x27;s safety from Skynet and Riley&#x27;s safety. Sarah and Derek help Charley rescue his wife from Cromartie, but she dies in a bomb explosion. Sarah shelters a young boy named Marty Bedell who is being hunted by a T-888 because he shares his name with a future high-ranking member of the human resistance. An attack from Margos Sarkissian leaves John traumatized. Sarah takes the blame of Sarkissian&#x27;s death for John, which Derek and Cameron later discover when John and Sarah argue. their relationship changes; John cannot let go of his guilt for killing Sarkissian; Sarah realizes that she cannot always protect her son. She seeks counseling from family psychiatrist Boyd Sherman but discovers his role in Skynet&#x27;s future.

Sarah is kidnapped by Cromartie, but she is rescued by John and James Ellison, an FBI agent who was earlier determined to bring her to justice. Along with Derek and Cameron, they plan to lure Cromartie into a nearby church; they kill and bury it and plan to destroy it later. Sarah smashes its CPU; her stress after the battle results in nightmares and sleepwalking. She visits Dr. Sherman again but is unable to be honest with him. Sarah remembers seeing a three-dotted symbol in her dreams. She has seen this before; it was left by a dying Resistance soldier in her basement. Her obsession with the symbol leads her to Dakara Systems, a technology company whose logo includes it. There, Alexander Agagi II is developing an artificial intelligence program named &quot;Emma&quot;. Realizing she has been chasing the wrong lead, Sarah&#x27;s stress becomes uncontrollable and she smashes mirrors in her bathroom. Derek thinks Sarah is losing her sanity.

At a UFO convention, which Sarah attends to investigate the three-dotted sign, she meets a woman named Eileen, who is really Alan Park, a scientist who specialized in Light Detection and Ranging. Fearing for his life he underwent sex reassignment surgery. He thinks he is being targeted by his former employer, and that drone sightings in the Mojave Desert are a government conspiracy. Sarah takes him to a hypnotherapist named Dr. Barbara Morris, to unravel his memories to reveal the location of the facility. An assassin arrives during the session and murders Morris and Park. Sarah has recorded the session; Park&#x27;s clues lead her to a warehouse. As she entered the building, she fights and apparently kills a man named Ed Winston, who has wounded her leg. Inside the warehouse, she sees three bright dots in the sky; they are hauls of a Hunter-Killer craft from the future. She kidnaps and forces a doctor to remove the bullet from her leg, and then tells Derek to destroy the evidence of her hospitalization to prevent the authorities and the machines from learning her identity and tracking her. After Derek finds her, Sarah decides to tell him about his relation to John, but he already knows. The family arrives at a company town, Charm Acres, looking for survivors of the warehouse explosion. At the end of their search, Sarah, John, Derek and Cameron see the Hunter-Killer drone.

Ed Winston has survived being shot by Sarah. Following a lead from Charm Acres, Sarah visits the factory where Winston kidnapped her and subjected her to hallucinogenic drugs to find out why she bombed the factory and the identities of her accomplices. After enduring Winston&#x27;s physical and psychological torments, Sarah breaks free and attacks and shoots him in the head, killing him. She is arrested by the police, beaten up and taken to jail.

Sarah is rescued from jail by John and Cameron; she accompanies them to go see the T-1001 impersonating Catherine Weaver, where it is suggested that she is building something like Skynet, hoping to defeat it. Before Sarah can find out more, the prototype Hunter-Killer assaults the building and the group escape. In the building&#x27;s basement Cameron gives her A.I. chip to Weaver&#x27;s creation, which is now stored in the exhumed body of Cromartie, who takes it into the future. John finds Cameron&#x27;s empty shell lying in the basement and a repeating message on the computer monitors reading, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, John&quot;. John discovers he cannot let her go. In an attempt to save both Cameron and Weaver&#x27;s creation, both John and Catherine go to the future after the Cromartie shell, while Sarah remains in the present to continue the fight.

==Other appearances==
===Theme park attraction===
Linda Hamilton briefly reprised her role for &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, a 1996 theme park attraction for Universal Studios. In the attraction, set after the events of the second film, Sarah and John break into Cyberdyne Systems to prevent the creation of Skynet, but they are stopped by a T-1000. John and a T-800 later travel to the future, where they succeed in destroying Skynet, and John returns to the present to reunite with Sarah.

===Literature===
The &quot;T2&quot; novel trilogy explores Sarah and John&#x27;s life while living off the grid. The first novel &quot;T2: Infiltrator&quot;, set six years after the events of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, sees Sarah and 16-year-old John live a relatively normal life under the assumed names John and Suzanne Krieger near a small town in Paraguay, believing they have destroyed Cyberdyne Systems for good and prevented the creation of Skynet. They own a successful trucking company known as Krieger Trucking, while also being proficient smugglers. Sarah works at the company, while John attends military school, quickly becoming one of their best students, gaining military skills, weaponry and hacking knowledge. They gain a new neighbor in Dieter von Rossbach, a former Austrian counterterrorism operative and future model for the T-800 series. He is drawn to the Connors, and after Sarah tells him about the future war, they are attacked by a new T-800, created in the present by a new Terminator model, the i-950 Infiltrator Serena Burns. Realizing that Judgment Day was not permanently averted, they attempt once again to stop Skynet&#x27;s creation with the help of Dieter. They eventually run into FBI agent Jordan Dyson, Miles Dyson&#x27;s brother who is looking to capture the Connors for his brother&#x27;s death and Cyberdyne&#x27;s destruction, but witnesses the Terminators himself and comes to believe them and decides to help them destroy Cyberdyne&#x27;s most recent facility and the remaining Terminators. Sarah is fatally wounded by Serena as she destroys her, while Dyson looks after her and makes sure she makes a full recovery. John and Dieter flee to Paraguay once again. Dyson, however, finds out that Cyberdyne has a back-up facility located in Montana and immediately informs them of this information.

The following novel, &quot;T2: Rising Storm&quot;, shows John and Dieter starting up the foundations of the future Resistance a few months after the events of the previous novel. John traces possible recruits all over the internet, while Dieter secures weaponry and supplies to live through the coming Judgment Day. Dieter has been chosen as John&#x27;s guardian by Sarah while she recovers from her wounds, becoming Sarah&#x27;s most trusted asset. She is taken back to Pescadero State Hospital and is transferred to a halfway house by Dr. Silberman. After having seen the T-800 and the T-1000 himself seven years previously, Silberman has come to believe Sarah&#x27;s story. When an undercover Terminator is watching over the recovering Sarah, Silberman helps her flee across the border so she can make it back to Paraguay, making amends for his previous treatment of her. Sarah stays at Dieter&#x27;s house, while Dieter and John head to Cyberdyne&#x27;s back-up site in Montana alongside Wendy Dorset, John&#x27;s new girlfriend and the Resistance&#x27;s first recruit. They come to the conclusion that no matter how far Skynet&#x27;s creation is delayed, it will seemingly always become sentient. John and Wendy design an A.I. virus which prevents it from ever becoming sentient. While Wendy is subdued by Serena Burns&#x27; first i-950 clone, Clea Bennet, John mistakenly uploads the wrong program into Skynet&#x27;s programming and Wendy is killed. A distraught John destroys Clea Bennet alongside Dieter, who end up fleeing the military base. As they head back to Paraguay, John feels like the entire journey was in vain, with he himself being responsible for Skynet&#x27;s eventual sentience. Meanwhile, Sarah has been attacked by Serena&#x27;s second clone, Alissa, managing to destroy it and preventing it from succeeding in its mission. Skynet, however, becomes sentient and starts its process of eradicating humanity.

The final novel, &quot;T2: The Future War&quot;, shows the destruction Skynet causes around the world and its killing of 3 billion lives. Skynet creates machines to track and kill the remaining humans. John has become the leader of the Resistance, with Sarah and Dieter having fallen in love and married. The life between the parents of John&#x27;s eventual father Kyle Reese is explored, starting with John identifying Kyle&#x27;s father and debating the extent of influence he should take in his grandfather&#x27;s life. Eventually, Kyle is born, captured by a patrol unit as a child and forced to work in a Skynet work camp. The work camp is liberated by John and his Tech-Com unit, freeing Kyle and the other prisoners, while Kyle&#x27;s parents are killed. John assigns his friend Jack Brock to protect Kyle, as well as becoming his foster father. He grows up fighting alongside John and his Tech-Com unit. Around the time John rescues Kyle, he has Sarah fake her death to serve as a martyr to the cause, also acknowledging how Kyle never met Sarah before he was sent back to the past. In 2029, as the Resistance is about to destroy Skynet&#x27;s defence grid, as a last ditch effort in winning the war it sends back a T-800 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, a T-1000 to 1995 to kill a 10-year-old John Connor, and the i-950 unit Serena Burns to 2001 to kill the Connors and ensure Skynet&#x27;s creation. Once John finds out about this, he sends the volunteering Kyle back to protect Sarah from the T-800 and a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self from the T-1000. Afterwards, Skynet is effectively destroyed and John is greeted by Sarah, Dieter and the remaining Resistance members as they are relieved that the great ordeal is finally over.

Sarah Connor appeared in the non-canonical Superman crossover &quot;Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future&quot; (2000). In the story, Sarah and John Connor join forces with Superman to destroy Skynet and Superman&#x27;s robotic enemy the Cyborg Superman. In the past, John and Sarah receive assistance from Supergirl (Matrix), Superboy and Superman&#x27;s nemesis Lex Luthor. After Superman is drawn into the future by the resistance when they attempted to retrieve a Terminator sent back after John, Skynet is destroyed when Superman detonates an EMP in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, using a shielded time machine to return to the past.

<doc id="762963" wikidata="Q1361139" url="?curid=762963" title="Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont">
<text>Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont (30 November 163710 January 1698) was a French ecclesiastical historian.

==Life==
He was born in Paris into a wealthy Jansenist family and was educated at the &quot;Petites écoles&quot; of Port-Royal, where his historical interests were formed and encouraged. At the age of twenty, he began his two monumental works, the &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire ecclésiastique des six premiers siècles&quot; and the &quot;Histoire des empereurs et autres princes qui ont régné pendant les six premiers siècles de l&#x27;Église&quot;. The first is a history of the first six centuries of the Christian Church. The second is a history of the Roman emperors during the same period.

Tillemont became a priest at the age of 39 and settled at Port-Royal. When Port-Royal was dissolved in 1679, he moved to his family estate at Tillemont, where he spent the rest of his life, pursuing his historical work with great devotion. His &quot;Histoire&quot; began to issue from the press in 1690 and his &quot;Mémoires&quot; in 1693. The publication of both works was not complete at the time of his death. The final volumes were completed and published posthumously by his secretary Michel Tronchay. Tronchay also published a biography of Tillemont in 1706 titled &quot;Idee de la vie et de l&#x27;esprit de M. L. de Tillemont&quot;.

Tillemont is cited frequently by Edward Gibbon in his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

Tillemont&#x27;s works were among the first to provide critical surveys of the full range of source material. His prose style is considered dry, but he had a reputation for accuracy, detail and conscientiousness. His work was attacked on a large scale by Honoratus a Sancta Maria in his three-volume &quot;Réflexions sur les règles et l&#x27;usage de la critique&quot; (1712–1720).

==Selected works==
* (6 vol.), 1690–97, 1701, 1738. 
* (16 vol.), 1693–1712.
* (6 vol.), editor Jules Renouard, Paris, 1847–1851.

<text>A templon (from Greek τέμπλον meaning &quot;temple&quot;, plural &quot;templa&quot;) is a feature of Byzantine churches consisting of a barrier separating the nave from the sanctuary near the altar.

The solid templon first appeared in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many Eastern Christian churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably not much different from the altar rails of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern iconostasis, still found in Orthodox churches today.

It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an architrave (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the sanctuary. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, icons were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.

==Origins==
The templon most likely has an independent origin from that of Latin chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, theater heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to Sophocles, consciously imitated the classical &quot;proskenion&quot; (Latin proscenium; the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down. The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian liturgy was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual.

A much more plausible theory is that the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the Torah screen in Jewish synagogues of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical Syrian pagan temple.

A direct comparison can also be made to the layout of the great Temple of Jerusalem. The most sacred and innermost portion, known as the Holy of Holies, was where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This room was separated from the larger part of the main building&#x27;s interior by a large curtain, the &quot;veil of the temple&quot;. Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on Yom Kippur. The third part was the entrance court. This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostatsis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies containing the consecrated Eucharist – the manifestation of the New Covenant, from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In Orthodox Christian tradition, with the exception of churches at women&#x27;s monasteries, only men with good cause may enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis.

Barriers called templons in Greek were also used on occasions when the Roman Emperors appeared in public, to segregate the Imperial retinue from the crowd.

==Etymology==
&quot;Templon&quot; is a loan word in Greek, from the Latin &quot;templum&quot;, &quot;temple&quot;; how and why it came to have its present meaning is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the form of the templon resembles a pagan temple. The steps up to the apse (semicircle where the altar is located) are analogous to the stereobate and stylobate of the temple (the floor of a temple). The colonnettes arranged in the π shape resemble the columns that surround all four sides of a temple, the architrave looks like the architrave on a temple, and the carved disks on the architrave are analogous to the metopes on the entablature.

However, it has also been suggested that the name templon derives not from the pagan temples but from the Christian idea of the shrine where God was worshipped, or more specifically the Temple in Jerusalem.
In almost all modern European languages, the word &quot;templon&quot; is a direct and late borrowing of the Greek architectural term, and it is rarely found outside the academic usage; besides the Greek &quot;templon&quot;, another direct descendant of the Latin &quot;templum&quot;, having the same architectural meaning, is the Romanian word &quot;tâmplă&quot;, &quot;iconostasis&quot;.

==Early templa==
The chancel barriers are also known in archaeology as chancel screens. Archaeological evidence for an early templon comes from the Cathedral of St. John at Stoudios in Constantinople, a basilica dedicated to John the Baptist, built around 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low parapet (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.

The enclosure around the altar was in early times called an &quot;Ambitus Altaris&quot;, and their railings were called &quot;cancelli&quot;, sometimes with columns or arches bearing curtains. According to St. Gregory of Tours, these curtains were also painted and embroidered with sacred images in France, and noted the presence of chancel screens in the apse of the Church of St. Pancras near Rome, and the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Pope Leo III also erected a pure silver chancel screen during the reign of Charlemagne. The 9th century Basilica of St. Mary Major had a screen of six purple marble columns topped with an architrave of white marble, from which hung veils. A lower barrier of silver columns projected outward from the screen.

Many fragments of a marble templon have been discovered on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

Though there is some architectural and archaeological evidence of early templa, the first and most detailed description of a templon comes from a poem by Paul the Silentiary, describing Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. It was composed near the end of Justinian I’s reign and was probably recited on Epiphany, January 6, 563, celebrating the reinauguration of the church after the reconstruction of the great dome.

Hagia Sophia’s templon surrounded, according to Paulus, &quot;such space as was reserved in the eastern arch of the great church for the bloodless sacrifices&quot;. That is, it stretched the length of the eastern semidome, including the apse but excluding the exedrae (half-dome recesses in a wall). Twelve silver-covered marble columns of approximately 4.94 meters from base to capital were arranged on three sides of a rectangular ground plan around the altar. A horizontal entablature rested upon these. Three doors allowed entry to the apse, the central one larger than the other two. Though earlier scholars have proposed that all columns and all doors were in a single line parallel to the apse, modern reconstructions show the central portal facing out to the nave with the smaller doors each located on the other sides of the rectangular plan.

In between the columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On them had been carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora had been dead for several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the architrave was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia&#x27;s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.

In any case, the majority of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia&#x27;s, were covered in precious metals and others used polychrome marbles. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the architraves with busts of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the architrave, initially with carved busts. This continued from the time of Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in Sebaste in Phrygia, which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to iconoclasm. Nicephorus I, Patriarch of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his &quot;Antirretikoi&quot;. Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of Saint Panteleimon in Nerzei.

==Evolution==

The templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries except in Cappadocia. As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches, though by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.

The templon began to change forms to the medieval templon with the attachment of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of these images are from the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the Deesis (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of Lazarus, linking the scene of Lazarus with the Holy Week images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style is representative of the increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.

During most of the Middle Byzantine period, the space between the colonnettes was not filled with icons but with curtains. Nicholaos Andidorum describes in his &quot;Protheoria&quot; &quot;the shutting of the doors and the closing of the curtain over them&quot;. The most widespread image on the medieval templon seems to have been the Deesis. Its popularity arose from not only its simplicity and elegance, suggesting the efficacy of prayer and the threat of the Last Judgment, but also because it could be easily adapted to the patron&#x27;s tastes with the addition of secondary scenes and characters, as in the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery where scenes from the life of St Eustratios appear on either side of the Deesis on a templon beam. Proskynetaria (large icons) also played a major part in the decoration of the medieval templon, either as monumental images placed on the piers flanking the templon or as portable images in front of the screen. Proskynetaria of both these types still exist in Cyprus, from Lagoudera, now in the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace in Nicosia, and in St Neophytos.
Sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries, icons and proskynetaria began to be placed in the intercolumnar openings on the templon. After the reconquest in 1261, carving on the medieval templon approached sculpture in the round. From this period, the first wood-carved templa, or iconostases, were produced. They for most part had a fixed program of icon decoration with three levels: the Local, the Deesis, and the Festival tiers. Early Russian versions were at chest height, and called &quot;thoraxis&quot; in Greek.

The full height iconostasis became standard in the 15th century, and probably owes more to 14th-century Hesychast mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the Russians than anything else. The first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed for the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow Kremlin by Theophanes the Greek in 1405, and soon copied by his assistant Andrey Rublyov in the Cathedral of the Dormition in Vladimir in 1408.

<doc id="762970" wikidata="Q1783557" url="?curid=762970" title="Morse potential">
<text>The Morse potential, named after physicist Philip M. Morse, is a convenient 
interatomic interaction model for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule. It is a better approximation for the vibrational structure of the molecule than the quantum harmonic oscillator because it explicitly includes the effects of bond breaking, such as the existence of unbound states. It also accounts for the anharmonicity of real bonds and the non-zero transition probability for overtone and combination bands. The Morse potential can also be used to model other interactions such as the interaction between an atom and a surface. Due to its simplicity (only three fitting parameters), it is not used in modern spectroscopy. However, its mathematical form inspired the MLR (Morse/Long-range) potential, which is the most popular potential energy function used for fitting spectroscopic data.

==Potential energy function==

The Morse potential energy function is of the form

:formula_1

Here formula_2 is the distance between the atoms, formula_3 is the equilibrium bond distance, formula_4 is the well depth (defined relative to the dissociated atoms), and formula_5 controls the &#x27;width&#x27; of the potential (the smaller formula_5 is, the larger the well). The dissociation energy of the bond can be calculated by subtracting the zero point energy formula_7 from the depth of the well. The force constant (stiffness) of the bond can be found by Taylor expansion of formula_8 around formula_9 to the second derivative of the potential energy function, from which it can be shown that the parameter, formula_5, is

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the force constant at the minimum of the well.

Since the zero of potential energy is arbitrary, the equation for the Morse potential can be rewritten any number of ways by adding or subtracting a constant value. When it is used to model the atom-surface interaction, the energy zero can be redefined so that the Morse potential becomes

:formula_13
which is usually written as

:formula_14

where formula_2 is now the coordinate perpendicular to the surface. This form approaches zero at infinite formula_2 and equals formula_17 at its minimum, i.e. formula_9. It clearly shows that the Morse potential is the combination of a short-range repulsion term (the former) and a long-range attractive term (the latter), analogous to the Lennard-Jones potential.

==Vibrational states and energies==
Like the quantum harmonic oscillator, the energies and eigenstates of the Morse potential can be found using operator methods.
One approach involves applying the factorization method to the Hamiltonian.

To write the stationary states on the Morse potential, i.e. solutions formula_19 and formula_20 of the following Schrödinger equation:

:formula_21

it is convenient to introduce the new variables:

:formula_22

Then, the Schrödinger equation takes the simplified form:

:formula_23
:formula_24
Its eigenvalues (reduced by formula_25) and eigenstates can be written as:
:formula_26
where
:formula_27
with formula_28 denoting the largest integer smaller than formula_29 and
:formula_30
where 
formula_31
and
formula_32
which satisfies the normalization condition
:formula_33

and where formula_34 is a generalized Laguerre polynomial:
:formula_35

There also exists the following analytical expression for matrix elements of the coordinate operator:
:formula_36
which is valid for formula_37 and formula_38 

The eigenenergies in the initial variables have the form:
:formula_39

where formula_40 is the vibrational quantum number and formula_41 has units of frequency. The latter is mathematically related to the particle mass, formula_42 and the Morse constants via

:formula_43

Whereas the energy spacing between vibrational levels in the quantum harmonic oscillator is constant at formula_44 the energy between adjacent levels decreases with increasing formula_45 in the Morse oscillator. Mathematically, the spacing of Morse levels is

:formula_46

This trend matches the inharmonicity found in real molecules. However, this equation fails above some value of formula_47 where formula_48 is calculated to be zero or negative. Specifically,

:formula_49 (integer part only).

This failure is due to the &quot;finite&quot; number of bound levels in the Morse potential, and some maximum formula_47 that remains bound. For energies above formula_51 all the possible energy levels are allowed and the equation for formula_20 is no longer valid.

Below formula_51 formula_20 is a good approximation for the true vibrational structure in non-rotating diatomic molecules. In fact, the real molecular spectra are generally fit to the form

:formula_55

in which the constants formula_56 and formula_57 can be directly related to the parameters for the Morse potential. Specifically,

:formula_58

and

:formula_59

Note that if formula_56 and formula_57 are given in formula_62 formula_63 is in cm/s (not m/s), formula_64 is in kg, and formula_65 is in in which case formula_66 will be in formula_67 and formula_25 will be in formula_69

As is clear from dimensional analysis, for historical reasons the last equation uses spectroscopic notation in which formula_56 represents a wavenumber obeying formula_71 and not an angular frequency given by formula_72
== Morse/Long-range potential ==

An extension of the Morse potential that made the Morse form useful for modern (high-resolution) spectroscopy is the MLR (Morse/Long-range) potential. The MLR potential is used as a standard for representing spectroscopic and/or virial data of diatomic molecules by a potential energy curve. It has been used on N2, Ca2, KLi, MgH, several electronic states of Li2, Cs2, Sr2, ArXe, LiCa, LiNa, Br2, Mg2, HF, HCl, HBr, HI, MgD, Be2, BeH, and NaH. More sophisticated versions are used for polyatomic molecules.

<text>In mathematics, complex projective space is the projective space with respect to the field of complex numbers. By analogy, whereas the points of a real projective space label the lines through the origin of a real Euclidean space, the points of a complex projective space label the &quot;complex&quot; lines through the origin of a complex Euclidean space (see below for an intuitive account). Formally, a complex projective space is the space of complex lines through the origin of an (&quot;n&quot;+1)-dimensional complex vector space. The space is denoted variously as P(C&quot;n&quot;+1), P&quot;n&quot;(C) or CP&quot;n&quot;. When , the complex projective space CP1 is the Riemann sphere, and when , CP2 is the complex projective plane (see there for a more elementary discussion).

Complex projective space was first introduced by as an instance of what was then known as the &quot;geometry of position&quot;, a notion originally due to Lazare Carnot, a kind of synthetic geometry that included other projective geometries as well. Subsequently, near the turn of the 20th century it became clear to the Italian school of algebraic geometry that the complex projective spaces were the most natural domains in which to consider the solutions of polynomial equations – algebraic varieties . In modern times, both the topology and geometry of complex projective space are well understood and closely related to that of the sphere. Indeed, in a certain sense the (2&quot;n&quot;+1)-sphere can be regarded as a family of circles parametrized by CP&quot;n&quot;: this is the Hopf fibration. Complex projective space carries a (Kähler) metric, called the Fubini–Study metric, in terms of which it is a Hermitian symmetric space of rank 1.

Complex projective space has many applications in both mathematics and quantum physics. In algebraic geometry, complex projective space is the home of projective varieties, a well-behaved class of algebraic varieties. In topology, the complex projective space plays an important role as a classifying space for complex line bundles: families of complex lines parametrized by another space. In this context, the infinite union of projective spaces (direct limit), denoted CP∞, is the classifying space K(Z,2). In quantum physics, the wave function associated to a pure state of a quantum mechanical system is a probability amplitude, meaning that it has unit norm, and has an inessential overall phase: that is, the wave function of a pure state is naturally a point in the projective Hilbert space of the state space.
Complex projective manifold is 2n dimensional space or it is n dimensional complex space.

==Introduction==

The notion of a projective plane arises out of the idea of perspection in geometry and art: that it is sometimes useful to include in the Euclidean plane an additional &quot;imaginary&quot; line that represents the horizon that an artist, painting the plane, might see. Following each direction from the origin, there is a different point on the horizon, so the horizon can be thought of as the set of all directions from the origin. The Euclidean plane, together with its horizon, is called the real projective plane, and the horizon is sometimes called a line at infinity. By the same construction, projective spaces can be considered in higher dimensions. For instance, the real projective 3-space is a Euclidean space together with a plane at infinity that represents the horizon that an artist (who must, necessarily, live in four dimensions) would see.

These real projective spaces can be constructed in a slightly more rigorous way as follows. Here, let R&quot;n&quot;+1 denote the real coordinate space of &quot;n&quot;+1 dimensions, and regard the landscape to be painted as a hyperplane in this space. Suppose that the eye of the artist is the origin in R&quot;n&quot;+1. Then along each line through his eye, there is a point of the landscape or a point on its horizon. Thus the real projective space is the space of lines through the origin in R&quot;n&quot;+1. Without reference to coordinates, this is the space of lines through the origin in an (&quot;n&quot;+1)-dimensional real vector space.

To describe the complex projective space in an analogous manner requires a generalization of the idea of vector, line, and direction. Imagine that instead of standing in a real Euclidean space, the artist is standing in a complex Euclidean space C&quot;n&quot;+1 (which has real dimension 2&quot;n&quot;+2) and the landscape is a &quot;complex&quot; hyperplane (of real dimension 2&quot;n&quot;). Unlike the case of real Euclidean space, in the complex case there are directions in which the artist can look which do not see the landscape (because it does not have high enough dimension). However, in a complex space, there is an additional &quot;phase&quot; associated with the directions through a point, and by adjusting this phase the artist can guarantee that they typically see the landscape. The &quot;horizon&quot; is then the space of directions, but such that two directions are regarded as &quot;the same&quot; if they differ only by a phase. The complex projective space is then the landscape (C&quot;n&quot;) with the horizon attached &quot;at infinity&quot;. Just like the real case, the complex projective space is the space of directions through the origin of C&quot;n&quot;+1, where two directions are regarded as the same if they differ by a phase.

==Construction==
Complex projective space is a complex manifold that may be described by &quot;n&quot; + 1 complex coordinates as

:formula_1

where the tuples differing by an overall rescaling are identified:

:formula_2

That is, these are homogeneous coordinates in the traditional sense of projective geometry. The point set CP&quot;n&quot; is covered by the patches formula_3. In &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;, one can define a coordinate system by
:formula_4
The coordinate transitions between two different such charts &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;U&quot;&quot;j&quot; are holomorphic functions (in fact they are fractional linear transformations). Thus CP&quot;n&quot; carries the structure of a complex manifold of complex dimension &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;a fortiori&quot; the structure of a real differentiable manifold of real dimension 2&quot;n&quot;.

One may also regard CP&quot;n&quot; as a quotient of the unit 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 sphere in C&quot;n&quot;+1 under the action of U(1):
:CP&quot;n&quot; = &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;+1/U(1).
This is because every line in C&quot;n&quot;+1 intersects the unit sphere in a circle. By first projecting to the unit sphere and then identifying under the natural action of U(1) one obtains CP&quot;n&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; = 1 this construction yields the classical Hopf bundle formula_5. From this perspective, the differentiable structure on CP&quot;n&quot; is induced from that of &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;+1, being the quotient of the latter by a compact group that acts properly.

==Topology==
The topology of CP&quot;n&quot; is determined inductively by the following cell decomposition. Let &quot;H&quot; be a fixed hyperplane through the origin in C&quot;n&quot;+1. Under the projection map , &quot;H&quot; goes into a subspace that is homeomorphic to CP&quot;n&quot;−1. The complement of the image of &quot;H&quot; in CP&quot;n&quot; is homeomorphic to C&quot;n&quot;. Thus CP&quot;n&quot; arises by attaching a 2&quot;n&quot;-cell to CP&quot;n&quot;−1:
:formula_6
Alternatively, if the 2&quot;n&quot;-cell is regarded instead as the open unit ball in C&quot;n&quot;, then the attaching map is the Hopf fibration of the boundary. An analogous inductive cell decomposition is true for all of the projective spaces; see .

=== CW-decomposition ===
One useful way to construct the complex projective spaces formula_7 is through a recursive construction using CW-complexes. Recall that there is a homeomorphism formula_8 to the 2-sphere, giving the first space. We can then induct on the cells to get a pushout map formula_9 where formula_10 is the four ball, and formula_11 represents the generator in formula_12 (hence it is homotopy equivalent to the Hopf map). We can then inductively construct the spaces as pushout diagrams formula_13 where formula_14 represents an element in formula_15 The isomorphism of homotopy groups is described below, and the isomorphism of homotopy groups is a standard calculation in stable homotopy theory (which can be done with the Serre spectral sequence, Freudenthal suspension theorem, and the Postnikov tower). The map comes from the fiber bundle formula_16 giving a non-contractible map, hence it represents the generator in formula_17. Otherwise, there would be a homotopy equivalence formula_18, but then it would be homotopy equivalent to formula_19, a contradiction which can be seen by looking at the homotopy groups of the space.

===Point-set topology===
Complex projective space is compact and connected, being a quotient of a compact, connected space.

===Homotopy groups===

From the fiber bundle
:formula_20
or more suggestively
:formula_21
CP&quot;n&quot; is simply connected. Moreover, by the long exact homotopy sequence, the second homotopy group is , and all the higher homotopy groups agree with those of &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;+1: for all &quot;k&quot; &gt; 2.

===Homology===
In general, the algebraic topology of CP&quot;n&quot; is based on the rank of the homology groups being zero in odd dimensions; also &quot;H&quot;2&quot;i&quot;(CP&quot;n&quot;, Z) is infinite cyclic for &quot;i&quot; = 0 to &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, the Betti numbers run
:1, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...
That is, 0 in odd dimensions, 1 in even dimensions 0 through 2n. The Euler characteristic of CP&quot;n&quot; is therefore &quot;n&quot; + 1. By Poincaré duality the same is true for the ranks of the cohomology groups. In the case of cohomology, one can go further, and identify the graded ring structure, for cup product; the generator of &quot;H&quot;2(CPn, Z) is the class associated to a hyperplane, and this is a ring generator, so that the ring is isomorphic with
:Z[&quot;T&quot;]/(&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1),

with &quot;T&quot; a degree two generator. This implies also that the Hodge number &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;i&quot; = 1, and all the others are zero. See .

===&quot;K&quot;-theory===
It follows from induction and Bott periodicity that

:formula_22

The tangent bundle satisfies

:formula_23

where formula_24 denotes the trivial line bundle, from the Euler sequence. From this, the Chern classes and characteristic numbers can be calculated explicitly.

===Classifying space===
There is a space formula_25 which, in a sense, is the inductive limit of formula_7 as formula_27. It is BU(1), the classifying space of U(1), the circle group, in the sense of homotopy theory, and so classifies complex line bundles. Equivalently it accounts for the first Chern class. This can be seen heuristically by looking at the fiber bundle maps formula_28 and formula_27. This gives a fiber bundle (called the universal circle bundle) formula_30 constructing this space. Note using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, we have formula_31 hence formula_25 is an Eilenberg–MacLane space, a formula_33. Because of this fact, and Brown&#x27;s representability theorem, we have the following isomorphism formula_34 for any nice CW-complex formula_35. Moreover, from the theory of Chern classes, every complex line bundle formula_36 can be represented as a pullback of the universal line bundle on formula_25, meaning there is a pullback square formula_38 where formula_39 is the associated vector bundle of the principal formula_40-bundle formula_41. See, for instance, and .

==Differential geometry==
The natural metric on CP&quot;n&quot; is the Fubini–Study metric, and its holomorphic isometry group is the projective unitary group PU(&quot;n&quot;+1), where the stabilizer of a point is

:formula_42

It is a Hermitian symmetric space , represented as a coset space

:formula_43

The geodesic symmetry at a point &quot;p&quot; is the unitary transformation that fixes &quot;p&quot; and is the negative identity on the orthogonal complement of the line represented by &quot;p&quot;.

===Geodesics===
Through any two points &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; in complex projective space, there passes a unique &quot;complex&quot; line (a CP1). A great circle of this complex line that contains &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; is a geodesic for the Fubini–Study metric. In particular, all of the geodesics are closed (they are circles), and all have equal length. (This is always true of Riemannian globally symmetric spaces of rank 1.)

The cut locus of any point &quot;p&quot; is equal to a hyperplane CP&quot;n&quot;−1. This is also the set of fixed points of the geodesic symmetry at &quot;p&quot; (less &quot;p&quot; itself). See .

===Sectional curvature pinching===
It has sectional curvature ranging from 1/4 to 1, and is the roundest manifold that is not a sphere (or covered by a sphere): by the 1/4-pinched sphere theorem, any complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with curvature strictly between 1/4 and 1 is diffeomorphic to the sphere. Complex projective space shows that 1/4 is sharp. Conversely, if a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold has sectional curvatures in the closed interval [1/4,1], then it is either diffeomorphic to the sphere, or isometric to the complex projective space, the quaternionic projective space, or else the Cayley plane F4/Spin(9); see .

===Spin structure===
The odd-dimensional projective spaces can be given a spin structure, the even-dimensional ones cannot.

==Algebraic geometry==
Complex projective space is a special case of a Grassmannian, and is a homogeneous space for various Lie groups. It is a Kähler manifold carrying the Fubini–Study metric, which is essentially determined by symmetry properties. It also plays a central role in algebraic geometry; by Chow&#x27;s theorem, any compact complex submanifold of CP&quot;n&quot; is the zero locus of a finite number of polynomials, and is thus a projective algebraic variety. See 

===Zariski topology===

In algebraic geometry, complex projective space can be equipped with another topology known as the Zariski topology . Let denote the commutative ring of polynomials in the (&quot;n&quot;+1) variables &quot;Z&quot;0...,&quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;. This ring is graded by the total degree of each polynomial:
:formula_44
Define a subset of CP&quot;n&quot; to be &quot;closed&quot; if it is the simultaneous solution set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials. Declaring the complements of the closed sets to be open, this defines a topology (the Zariski topology) on CP&quot;n&quot;.

===Structure as a scheme===
Another construction of CP&quot;n&quot; (and its Zariski topology) is possible. Let &quot;S&quot;+ ⊂ &quot;S&quot; be the ideal spanned by the homogeneous polynomials of positive degree:
:formula_45
Define Proj &quot;S&quot; to be the set of all homogeneous prime ideals in &quot;S&quot; that do not contain &quot;S&quot;+. Call a subset of Proj &quot;S&quot; closed if it has the form
:formula_46
for some ideal &quot;I&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. The complements of these closed sets define a topology on Proj &quot;S&quot;. The ring &quot;S&quot;, by localization at a prime ideal, determines a sheaf of local rings on Proj &quot;S&quot;. The space Proj &quot;S&quot;, together with its topology and sheaf of local rings, is a scheme. The subset of closed points of Proj &quot;S&quot; is homeomorphic to CP&quot;n&quot; with its Zariski topology. Local sections of the sheaf are identified with the rational functions of total degree zero on CP&quot;n&quot;.

===Line bundles===
All line bundles on complex projective space can be obtained by the following construction. A function is called homogeneous of degree &quot;k&quot; if
:formula_47
for all } and }. More generally, this definition makes sense in cones in }. A set } is called a cone if, whenever , then for all }; that is, a subset is a cone if it contains the complex line through each of its points. If is an open set (in either the analytic topology or the Zariski topology), let } be the cone over &quot;U&quot;: the preimage of &quot;U&quot; under the projection . Finally, for each integer &quot;k&quot;, let &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)(&quot;U&quot;) be the set of functions that are homogeneous of degree &quot;k&quot; in &quot;V&quot;. This defines a sheaf of sections of a certain line bundle, denoted by &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;).

In the special case , the bundle &quot;O&quot;(−1) is called the tautological line bundle. It is equivalently defined as the subbundle of the product
:formula_48
whose fiber over is the set
:formula_49

These line bundles can also be described in the language of divisors. Let &quot;H&quot; = CP&quot;n&quot;−1 be a given complex hyperplane in CP&quot;n&quot;. The space of meromorphic functions on CP&quot;n&quot; with at most a simple pole along &quot;H&quot; (and nowhere else) is a one-dimensional space, denoted by &quot;O&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), and called the hyperplane bundle. The dual bundle is denoted &quot;O&quot;(−&quot;H&quot;), and the &quot;k&quot;th tensor power of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is denoted by &quot;O&quot;(&quot;kH&quot;). This is the sheaf generated by holomorphic multiples of a meromorphic function with a pole of order &quot;k&quot; along &quot;H&quot;. It turns out that
:formula_50
Indeed, if is a linear defining function for &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;L&quot;−&quot;k&quot; is a meromorphic section of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), and locally the other sections of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) are multiples of this section.

Since , the line bundles on CP&quot;n&quot; are classified up to isomorphism by their Chern classes, which are integers: they lie in . In fact, the first Chern classes of complex projective space are generated under Poincaré duality by the homology class associated to a hyperplane &quot;H&quot;. The line bundle &quot;O&quot;(&quot;kH&quot;) has Chern class &quot;k&quot;. Hence every holomorphic line bundle on CP&quot;n&quot; is a tensor power of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) or &quot;O&quot;(−&quot;H&quot;). In other words, the Picard group of CP&quot;n&quot; is generated as an abelian group by the hyperplane class [&quot;H&quot;] .

GE Capital Bank was a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). GE Capital Bank was sold to Goldman Sachs in 2016.

GE Capital owned WMC Mortgage from 2004 to 2007. The company briefly owned Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company from 1986 until its sale to PaineWebber in 1994.

The capital group also had its hand in broadcasting throughout the early 1990s to own radio and television stations. The company first purchased Pegasus Broadcasting, who owns three television stations WJBF-TV, WAPA-TV and KSCH-TV in 1990. The company next purchased CBS affiliate WCSC-TV in 1991, and radio stations KMOW-AM and KEYI-FM in Austin later that year.

The capital quit broadcasting in stages, starting with the sale of radio stations in Austin to Mercury Broadcasting in 1991, then the sale of WJBF-TV to Spartan Communications in 1992, followed by the sales of WCSC-TV to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in 1993 and KSCH-TV to Wing Fat, through a group Channel 58 Inc. in 1994, and five years later, sold its final station WAPA-TV to LIN Television Corporation in 1999.

==Legal issues==
In April 1997, a lawsuit against General Electric Capital Corp was filed on behalf of the company&#x27;s customers who filed for bankruptcy. The GE Capital Corp. was accused of unfair debt collection practices. The class action lawsuit resulted in $100 million settlement with over 100,000 class members from 50 states. Plaintiffs claimed that the company solicited agreements from bankrupt debtors to repay their credit card debts but failed to notify bankruptcy court of the agreement. Those reaffirmation agreements legally required the debtors to continue paying off their debt in exchange for keeping the credit card, even though bankruptcy erases credit card debts. The lawsuit claimed that GE Capital was required by law to file the agreements with bankruptcy courts and did not do so. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to refund, with interest, all credit card payments made after debtors entered into the reaffirmation agreements between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 1997. GE Capital Corp. also promised to advise credit bureaus to correct any negative credit reports related to class members’ failure to repay reaffirmed debt.

In June 2014, Synchrony Bank, formerly GE Capital Retail Bank, agreed to settle claims of illegal credit card practices that were filed by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the United States Justice Department by agreeing to pay $225 million to Spanish speaking consumers that were harmed by discriminatory practices and deceptive marketing. The bank was also required to pay an additional $3.5 million in civil penalties to the CFPB&#x27;s Civil Penalty Fund for deceptive credit card marketing.

==Divestment==
On March 13, 2014, GE Capital announced that it would spin its North American consumer finance division off under the new name Synchrony Financial through an initial public offering (IPO). On July 31, 2014, Synchrony Financial raised $2.9 billion in its IPO when GE sold 125 million shares (15%) of the company.

On April 10, 2015, it was announced that GE would sell most of GE Capital&#x27;s commercial and consumer businesses within two years, focusing instead on its leasing businesses connected with GE&#x27;s manufacturing businesses. The company reached an agreement to sell the majority of its property business to Wells Fargo and Blackstone, valued at $26.5 billion. GE Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt, announced the plan in a letter to shareholders. It is &quot;a big change for GE,&quot; but he said it is &quot;right for the company.&quot; Under the plan, Immelt said that GE expects more than 90% of its earnings will be generated by its industrial businesses by 2018, up from 58% in 2014. GE Capital, meanwhile, will make up 10% of the company&#x27;s revenues by 2018, down from 46% in 2001. Shareholders applauded the announcement, pushing shares in G.E. up nearly 11 percent, to $28.51, levels unseen since the financial crisis. However, the downsizing is no small matter for a company whose empire encompasses 175 countries and employs about 305,000 people.

In June 2015, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced it would acquire GE Capital&#x27;s private equity lending portfolio for $12 billion.

<text>Gentle Giant were a British progressive rock band active between 1970 and 1980. They were known for the complexity and sophistication of their music and for the varied musical skills of the members. All of the band members were multi-instrumentalists. Although not commercially successful, the band did achieve a cult following.

The band stated that their aim was to &quot;expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular&quot;, although this stance was to alter significantly with time.

Gentle Giant&#x27;s music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swathe of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their &quot;classical&quot; influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of François Rabelais and R. D. Laing. In 2015 they were recognised with the lifetime achievement award at the Progressive Music Awards.

==Band history==
===Prehistory (including Simon Dupree and the Big Sound)===
The core of what was to become Gentle Giant comprised three brothers: Phil Shulman (born 1937), Derek Shulman (born 1947) and Ray Shulman (1949–2023). The brothers were of Scottish-Jewish descent. Phil and Derek were born in the Gorbals, which was then a notorious slum area of Glasgow, Scotland. The family moved to Portsmouth, England, where Ray was born. Their father was an army musician turned jazz trumpeter, who continued his musical work in Portsmouth. He encouraged his sons to learn various instruments; and Phil, Derek, and Ray all became multi-instrumentalists. During the early 1960s, Derek and Ray became interested in playing rhythm-and-blues and formed a band together. Phil – originally acting as a manager figure in order to look after his much younger brothers – eventually became a band member himself.

By 1966, the Shulmans&#x27; band – initially called the Howling Wolves, then the Road Runners – had taken on the name of Simon Dupree and the Big Sound and were pursuing more of a soul/pop direction. As lead singer and frontman, Derek Shulman took on the &#x27;Simon Dupree&#x27; pseudonym while Phil played saxophone and trumpet, and youngest brother Ray played guitar and violin. (Both Ray and Phil also played trumpet and sang backing vocals for the group which, during its lifetime, briefly featured the future Elton John as pianist as well as recording a single with Dudley Moore as guest). Signing to the EMI record label, Simon Dupree and the Big Sound produced several non-charting singles before being pushed by their management and label in the direction of psychedelia. This resulted in the UK Top 10 hit &quot;Kites&quot; in the autumn of 1967 (and the release of the &quot;Without Reservation&quot; album later in the year).

Success only served to frustrate the Shulman brothers, who considered themselves to be blue-eyed soul singers and felt that their change of style was insincere and insubstantial. Derek Shulman was later to describe &quot;Kites&quot; as &quot;utter shit&quot;.&quot; The Shulmans&#x27; opinion was confirmed, in their eyes, by the successive failure of follow-up singles to &quot;Kites&quot;. Attempting to escape their new image, they released a pseudonymous double A-side single in late 1968 as the Moles – &quot;We Are the Moles (parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;. This compounded their identity crisis as the single was subsequently caught up in a rumour that the Moles were, in fact, the Beatles recording under a different name and with Ringo Starr as lead singer. The rumour was eventually debunked by Pink Floyd leader Syd Barrett, who outed Simon Dupree and the Big Sound as the band behind the record.

In 1969, the Shulman brothers finally dissolved the group in order to escape the pop music environment that had frustrated them. They did not return directly to rhythm and blues or soul, but instead chose to pursue a more complicated direction. Ray Shulman later stated, &quot;We knew we couldn&#x27;t continue with the musicians we&#x27;d had before. We weren&#x27;t interested in the other musicians in the band — they couldn&#x27;t contribute anything. We had to teach them what to do. It got rather heavy when we could play drums better than the drummer, and even on record we were doing more and more of it with overdubs. It got stupid having a band like (that). The first thing was to get some musicians of a higher standard.&quot;

===Formation of Gentle Giant===
Gentle Giant was formed in 1970 when the Shulman brothers teamed up with two other multi-instrumentalists, Gary Green (guitar, mandolin, recorder etc.) and Kerry Minnear (keyboards, vibraphone, cello, etc.), plus drummer Martin Smith, who had previously drummed for Simon Dupree and the Big Sound. The classically trained Minnear had recently graduated from the Royal College of Music with a degree in composition, and had played with the band Rust. Green was essentially a blues player and had never worked with a band above the semi-professional level, but adapted readily to the demanding music of the new band. The Shulman brothers, meanwhile, settled into typically multi-instrumental roles of their own — Derek on saxophone and recorder; Ray on bass and violin; and Phil on saxophone, trumpet, and clarinet (with all three brothers playing other instruments as and when required).

The new band also featured three lead vocalists. Derek Shulman sang in a tough rhythm-and-blues style and generally handled the more rock-oriented vocals; Phil Shulman handled the more folk-or-jazz-influenced songs; and Kerry Minnear (who had a particularly delicate voice) sang the lighter folk and chamber-classical lead vocals. Minnear did not sing lead vocals at live concerts, because of his inability to support and project his voice at a level suitable for live amplification (Derek and Phil Shulman handled Minnear&#x27;s lead vocal parts when the band played live). It has been reported that Elton John unsuccessfully auditioned for lead vocalist with the newly formed group.

According to a booklet that was included in their first album, the band&#x27;s name was a reference to a fictional character, a &quot;gentle giant&quot; that happens upon a band of musicians and is enthralled with their music. The character is reminiscent of those from the Renaissance tales of François Rabelais.

From the start, Gentle Giant was a particularly flexible band because of the exceptionally broad musical skills of its members. One Gentle Giant album would list a total of forty-six instruments in the musician credits — all of which had been played by group members — and five of the six members sang, enabling the band to write and perform detailed vocal harmony and counterpoint. The band&#x27;s approach to songwriting was equally diverse, blending a wide variety of ideas and influences whether they were considered commercial or otherwise.

===Early Gentle Giant: the debut album, &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot; and &quot;Three Friends&quot;===
The band&#x27;s first album was the self-titled &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; in 1970, produced by Tony Visconti. Combining the collective band members&#x27; influences of rock, blues, classical, and 1960s British soul, it was an immediately challenging effort, although it has sometimes been criticised for having a slightly disappointing recording quality.

&quot;Gentle Giant&quot; was followed in 1971 by &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;. This second album showcased a band who were developing rapidly. Far more experimental and dissonant than its predecessor, &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot; was shaped primarily by Kerry Minnear&#x27;s broad classical and contemporary classical music training. It also showed the band expanding their instrumental palette (although many years later Derek Shulman would admit &quot;we recorded [&quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;] without any idea of what it would be like before we got into the studio. It was a very experimental album and we still didn&#x27;t have an ultimate direction&quot;.)&quot; The band&#x27;s sense of challenge was made evident in the liner notes to &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;, which contained a particularly lofty statement of intent even by progressive rock standards. Producer Tony Visconti has claimed authorship of this liner note as well as the &quot;giant&quot; story accompanying the first album

After &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;, Martin Smith left the band, apparently because of disagreements with both Ray and Phil Shulman. He was replaced by Malcolm Mortimore.

Gentle Giant&#x27;s next recording was &quot;Three Friends&quot; (1972). This was the band&#x27;s first concept album, and was based around the theme of three boys who are &quot;inevitably separated by chance, skill, and fate&quot; as they become men. Over the course of the album, the three friends travel on from being childhood schoolfriends to becoming, respectively, a road digger, an artist, and a white-collar worker. In the process, they lose their ability to relate to each other or understand each other&#x27;s lifestyles. The development and fate of each character is musically represented by separate yet integrated styles, from hard rhythm-and-blues-edged rock to symphonic classical stylings.

In March 1972, Malcolm Mortimore injured himself in a motorcycle accident. To fulfil tour obligations in April, Gentle Giant hired John &quot;Pugwash&quot; Weathers (born 7 February 1947) (ex-Grease Band/Wild Turkey/Graham Bond&#x27;s Magic). Weathers was a harder-hitting player who also sang and played melodic percussion and guitar, further expanding Gentle Giant&#x27;s instrumental performance options. Because of Mortimore&#x27;s extended convalescence, the band opted to formally replace him with Weathers at the end of the 1972 April tour.

===&quot;Octopus&quot; and the departure of Phil Shulman===
The new line-up of Gentle Giant released the &quot;Octopus&quot; album later in 1972. The band&#x27;s hardest-rocking album to date, &quot;Octopus&quot; was allegedly titled by Phil Shulman&#x27;s wife Roberta as a pun on &quot;octo opus&quot; (eight musical works, reflecting the album&#x27;s eight tracks). It maintained Gentle Giant&#x27;s distinctively broad and challengingly integrated style, one of the highlights being the intricate madrigal-styled vocal workout &quot;Knots&quot; (whose lyrics are taken from various verses of poetry from R. D. Laing&#x27;s book of the same title).

The release of &quot;Octopus&quot; is generally considered to herald the start of Gentle Giant&#x27;s peak period. In 2004, Ray Shulman commented &quot;[&quot;Octopus&quot;] was probably our best album, with the exception perhaps of &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;. We started with the idea of writing a song about each member of the band. Having a concept in mind was a good starting point for writing. I don&#x27;t know why, but despite the impact of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, almost overnight concept albums were suddenly perceived as rather naff and pretentious&quot;.&quot;

Before embarking on the &quot;Octopus&quot; tour, the band played a gruelling set of dates supporting Black Sabbath, during which they proved to be very unpopular with the majority of the headlining band&#x27;s fans. Derek Shulman recalled, &quot;It was perhaps the most ridiculous pairing of groups ever in the history of show business. For the most part we got booed off the stage&quot;. Following the tour, Gentle Giant underwent their most significant line-up change when a burnt-out and discouraged Phil Shulman left the band following disagreements with his brothers. Derek Shulman took over all lead vocals for live concerts, becoming Gentle Giant&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; lead singer (although Kerry Minnear continued to sing his own share of lead vocals on records).
Gary Green later recalled &quot;As I remember it, when Phil announced it at the end of an Italian tour, he said he would leave the band. He couldn&#x27;t continue on. There was too much stress being on the road and the family. Plus the brothers were having a bit of a difficult time. They&#x27;re brothers and they argued like hell, sometimes to the point where you thought they were going to hit each other. But I guess it was brotherly love [laughs]. But when Phil said he was going to leave, we were all like stumped, &#x27;Oh! What are we going to do? All right we&#x27;ll buy a Moog synthesizer!&#x27; That&#x27;s kind of trite; I don&#x27;t mean it quite like that. We had to do something&quot;.

&quot;John [Weathers] and I really pushed for the band to continue at that point because it looked like we were going to fold. And that seemed just ludicrous – I mean we had Kerry at full strength and Ray writing great. We were really strong live and we were about to get stronger. I think we became a stronger band after Phil left. And that&#x27;s nothing against Phil. We had just been just hitting our stride as players&quot;.

Over thirty years later, Phil Shulman expanded on his reasons for departure in a 2008 podcast interview conducted by his son Damon and grandson Elliot. In the interview he stated that his main motivation for leaving was because he had realised that the lifestyle of a touring musician was damaging his family life. The two factions of Shulman brothers - with Phil on one side and Ray and Derek on the other would eventually resolve their differences and heal their relationship, although Phil never rejoined the band or returned to music as a career. Ray Shulman has subsequently assisted Phil&#x27;s son Damon Shulman with his own music.

===&quot;In a Glass House&quot; and &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;===

The remaining quintet regrouped to record the harder-rocking &quot;In a Glass House&quot;, which was released in 1973. They played their first gig as a five-piece at King Alfred&#x27;s College, Winchester. &quot;In a Glass House&quot; is a complex and determined concept album - named after the aphorism that &quot;people who live in glass houses shouldn&#x27;t throw stones&quot;—it was the band&#x27;s most directly psychological effort to date. The album was also notable for its three-dimensional cover, using a cellophane overlay (replicated using the CD jewel case on the Terrapin CD reissue, and via a custom digipak for the later Alucard CD reissue). &quot;In a Glass House&quot; was never released in the US, but was in great demand as an import.

&quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; followed in 1974. This was Gentle Giant&#x27;s third concept album, this time taking power and corruption as the linking theme. The band also wrote a separate single with the same title. According to Derek Shulman, &quot;WWA said, &#x27;Now boys, you&#x27;ve got to be commercial, you&#x27;ve gotta make singles. Now you run away and write us a single.&#x27; So we did three atrocious numbers. This song&#x27;s the worst—&#x27;You&#x27;ve got it lads!&#x27;—and we went into the studio and handed over the tapes when we came out. They put it out, we yelled at them, and they gave it back—took it off the market&quot; (the single was added to CD reissues of the album).

===The Chrysalis years, part 1: &quot;Free Hand&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot; and &quot;Playing the Fool&quot;===

Dissatisfied with their deal with WWA, Gentle Giant signed a new deal with Chrysalis Records, with whom they would stay for the rest of their career. Although the band were still writing and performing some of the most complex rock music of the period, it was at this point that they began to polish and slightly simplify their songs for accessibility, in order to reach a wider audience (in particular an American one). Their efforts seemed successful enough to get 1975&#x27;s &quot;Free Hand&quot; into the Top 50 of the album chart in the USA. Strongly influenced by the music of the Renaissance and Middle Ages as well as jazz-rock the album&#x27;s songs reflected on lost love and damaged relationships, including the breakdown of the band&#x27;s relationship with their former manager. It became one of the band&#x27;s most popular and accessible releases.

Gentle Giant&#x27;s next release was 1976&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; - another concept album, this time based around an imaginary interview with the band. The music pointedly poked fun at the state of the music industry and at the silly questions that rock stars are repeatedly asked in order to project an image for marketing. Ironically, this more satirical and subversive approach ultimately proved to be a symptom of the undermining of the band&#x27;s work and artistic integrity. Derek Shulman later admitted, &quot;I think &quot;Interview&quot; was the start of the erosion. I think the creative juices were starting to wane a little bit... I think &quot;Interview&quot; was the start of the slide towards the realization that this is a business now, and that&#x27;s also a part of what the business had become. I was managing the band at the time and music business became a major business&quot;.&quot; Despite this approach, the album did not repeat its predecessor&#x27;s American chart success, peaking at No. 137.

By this time, Gentle Giant had become a well-established live act in America and Europe, touring persistently and sharing stages with anyone from Sha Na Na to progressive rock contemporaries such as Jethro Tull and Yes. The band&#x27;s notoriously virtuosic live act (featuring rapid-fire instrument-swapping and demanding rearrangements of the already complex studio pieces) made a powerful impression on audiences, meaning that Gentle Giant could equal almost any act on the bill. One 1975 show (at Detroit&#x27;s Cobo Hall) saw them steal the show from both Gary Wright (debuting his &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; album) and Rick Wakeman (headlining with the touring version of &quot;The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot;). In 1976 this side of the band was captured on the live album &quot;Playing the Fool&quot;, recorded during the European tour for &quot;Interview&quot;.

===The Chrysalis years, part 2: &quot;The Missing Piece&quot; and &quot;Giant for a Day!&quot;===

Affected by changes in popular style (including the growth of punk rock), the band made a mutual decision to refine their writing and performance style in pursuit of a broader market, particularly in America. Over the next two years, the band gradually jettisoned many of their complicated stylings in order to attempt to write simpler pop music and attempt to create hit singles.

&quot;The Missing Piece&quot; (recorded in the Netherlands and released in 1977) was a transitional album reflecting this new approach. While the second side featured longer and more eclectic songs reminiscent of the band&#x27;s earlier work, the first side featured outright examples of pop-rock, blue-eyed soul and even an attempt at punk. Three singles (&quot;Two Weeks in Spain&quot;, &quot;Mountain Time&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Turning Around&quot;) were released from the album, but failed to become hits: the album itself performed disappointingly in the marketplace, failing to win new fans or find favour with the band&#x27;s existing fanbase.

Despite this setback, the band pursued their course to its conclusion on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Giant for a Day!&quot; on which all former progressive rock stylings were purged in favour of radio-friendly soft rock and further (unsuccessful) attempts at creating hit singles. In order to present a more straightforward group identity, Derek Shulman now handled all lead vocals and the band abandoned their conventional battery of string instruments, wind instruments, tuned percussion and vocal interplay in favour of a straightforward guitar/bass/keyboards/drums/lead singer set-up. &quot;Giant for a Day!&quot; was another poor seller, later adjudged by the band as being a creative mistake. Derek Shulman eventually remembered it as being &quot;real contrived&quot; while Kerry Minnear would confess to having felt unsure as to whether he had anything to contribute to the album (although he did make an attempt to write a commercial single, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Goodbye&quot;).

===The Chrysalis years, part 3: &quot;Civilian&quot;===
In 1979, Gentle Giant relocated their centre of operations to Los Angeles in order to record their eleventh album, &quot;Civilian&quot;. This was a record of short rock songs with a strong new wave influence. While keeping the reduced instrumental approach of &quot;Giant for a Day!&quot;, the band allowed themselves far more freedom of arrangement and vocal work than they had for the previous album, and despite its relative simplicity the songwriting and execution were more reminiscent of earlier Gentle Giant work.

While Kerry Minnear would pronounce himself far more satisfied with this album and its songs, Ray Shulman would eventually state, &quot;I hated making [that] last record, I hated being involved with it&quot;. In 2005, Derek Shulman reflected, &quot;&quot;Civilian&quot; was done with less passion than some of the other albums. As it turns out we as a band were just not good at being rock or pop stars. We would have loved to be as popular as a Genesis or Rush or Yes. In hindsight, I sometimes think that Gentle Giant was wrongfully put into the progressive rock category. Much of what we did was very clever, but we certainly didn&#x27;t do these long complex tunes like Yes or Genesis did&quot;.

===Split===

In the summer of 1980, the group disbanded. In 2005, Derek Shulman recalled that &quot;the creative juices just weren&#x27;t flowing. I was living in Los Angeles at the time when we broke up. We weren&#x27;t really sure what direction to take. I don&#x27;t regret the decision we made to disband, and I&#x27;d do it again if we were to do the whole thing all over again&quot;. Ray Shulman has commented: &quot;There was definitely the decision that the last tour would be the last tour. Once we knew that, we enjoyed ourselves. We decided to quit then rather than let it go on too long&quot;.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2000, Kerry Minnear asserted that the split &quot;wasn&#x27;t because of punk; it was because we had lost our way musically&quot;.

Gary Green&#x27;s opinion of the split differs. In 2003 he commented: &quot;My own personal opinion is that the band broke up because Derek really wanted a hit album, and I think Ray did too, and they were fed up. They had been musicians longer than I had, and they had tasted it pretty good when they were with Simon Dupree, at least in Britain. And they were looking for some of that in Giant too. My feeling is that we could have continued on as PFM did, or Yes, and still continue. If we had adhered to the statement we started out with, we could still be playing that, and still be earning a reasonable living. That&#x27;s all water under the bridge and that&#x27;s fine now. It seemed a bit silly to cut off your creativity for that kind of thing&quot;.

Gentle Giant played their last gig at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California on 16 June 1980.

===Post-split===
Following the dissolution of the band, Derek Shulman went on to a successful career in the organisational side of the music business (initially promotion and artist development for PolyGram, followed by A&amp;R at Mercury Records, becoming president of Atco Records, after which he became President of Roadrunner Records. He is now the owner of new music company 2Plus Music &amp; Entertainment). 

Ray Shulman moved into soundtrack work for television and advertising before becoming a successful record producer (working with, among others, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the Sundays, and the Sugarcubes). He wrote soundtracks for computer games, as well as producing DVDs for artists such as Genesis and Queen. He died on 30 March 2023.

John Weathers went on to drum for Man (an association that lasted until 1996) and later played in Glenn Cornick&#x27;s Wild Turkey. Gary Green (having settled in America, near Chicago) went on to play with various Illinois bands (including Blind Dates, the Elvis Brothers, Big Hello, and Mother Tongue) and guest on recordings and at concerts by Eddie Jobson and Divae. Gary also played guitar on the album Deeper Imaginings by Paul Adams and Australian Elizabeth Geyer that was nominated best New Age album of 2019 by the Independent Music Awards. Kerry Minnear returned to the UK and settled in Cornwall, spending many years working in gospel music. He now runs Alucard Music, the organization supervising the legal and royalty issues regarding Gentle Giant&#x27;s music.

Following his time in Gentle Giant, Phil Shulman retired entirely from the music business. He subsequently worked as a teacher, in retail, and ran a gift shop in Gosport, Hampshire, UK before his retirement. He was briefly in a band with his son Damon Shulman and recorded several pieces with him. Several of these (under the collective title of &quot;Then&quot;) were spoken-word pieces in which he reminisced about his upbringing in the Glasgow slums. One of these pieces, &quot;Rats&quot;, appeared on Damon Shulman&#x27;s solo album &quot;In Pieces&quot; (2003) and can be heard as an audio stream on Damon Shulman&#x27;s homepage and MySpace page (made available in April 2008).

Original Gentle Giant drummer Martin Smith settled in Southampton and drummed with various bands there – he died on 2 March 1997. Second Gentle Giant drummer Malcolm Mortimore has continued to work as a successful sessions drummer in the rock, jazz, and theatre fields.

===Reunions===
Despite having seen many of their progressive rock contemporaries reunite for tours, Gentle Giant are notable for having consistently refused to reunite as a full band. In 1997, the Gentle Giant fanbase unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the members to perform a reunion concert. Reasons cited by members for their rejection include busy schedules, health problems, lack of practice on instruments, and other personal reasons. Asked about a possible reunion in 1995, Phil Shulman replied: &quot;We lead such disparate lives now and different lifestyles, different attitudes... I think it&#x27;s impossible&quot;. In 1998, Ray Shulman asserted: &quot;For me and Derek, the disruption to our lives now, I can&#x27;t see how it would be worth it. It would be very difficult. The whole process would take such a long time and you would have to give up what ever you are doing. We both have careers independent of GG&quot;.

There have been two collaborative efforts featuring between two and four of the band members, neither of which has been identified as a formal reunion of Gentle Giant. The first was a collaboration between four former Gentle Giant members – Kerry Minnear, John Weathers, Gary Green, and Phil Shulman (who only participated as a lyricist). This group recorded three new songs based on old Kerry Minnear demos for the 2004 &quot;Scraping the Barrel&quot; box set (&quot;Home Again&quot;, &quot;Moog Fugue&quot;, and &quot;Move Over&quot;). The band members recorded their parts separately and never reunited in person.

In 2008, a partial reunion of Gentle Giant involved the creation of a new band called Rentle Giant, in order to play Gentle Giant material. This band featured former members guitarist Gary Green and drummer Malcolm Mortimore. They recruited three noted jazz-fusion musicians to complete the band, with Roger Carey on bass and vocals, Andy Williams on guitar, and John Donaldson on piano and keyboards. Green contributed lead vocals to some of the songs.

In March 2009, Green and Mortimore were joined by a third Gentle Giant member in the form of Kerry Minnear and Rentle Giant consequently changed its name to Three Friends. Also at this time, the band recruited vocalist Mick Wilson as dedicated lead singer. After a short tour, it was announced that Minnear was leaving the band for personal reasons, and that Three Friends planned to continue as a six-piece. In due course, by 2011, Carey, Williams and Donaldson had left the band, to be replaced by Lee Pomeroy on bass and Gary Sanctuary on keyboards. Charlotte Glasson joined in 2012, adding violin, baritone sax, alto sax and recorder, enabling the band to create a live sound closer to the original recordings. This line-up toured Italy, Canada and the United States in 2012. In 2015, the band consisted of Green, Mortimore, Glasson, Neil Angilley and Jonathan Noyce. They have not performed live since then.

A fan video of &quot;Proclamation&quot; was posted on YouTube on 15 July 2020. The video featured appearances from Gentle Giant members Gary Green, Kerry Minnear, Derek Shulman, Ray Shulman (his last band-related appearance before his death), Phil Shulman, John Weathers and Malcolm Mortimore. Additional musicians included Jakko Jakszyk, Billy Sherwood, Yes/Steve Hackett bassist Lee Pomeroy, Rachel Flowers, Dan Reed (Dan Reed Network), Richard Hilton (Chic) and Mikey Heppner (Priestess) among others. The video was directed and edited by Noah Shulman and mixed by his uncle Ray.

==Reissues==

There has been renewed interest in Gentle Giant since 1990, with new fan clubs, new releases of live concerts and previously unreleased material, and several tribute albums. The rights of the band&#x27;s catalogue are scattered among many companies, not all of which are keen on re-releasing the albums properly. In particular, the first four albums have yet to receive definitive CD releases. For example, the title track on &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot; begins with an obvious defect, possibly from a damaged master tape, on all current CD and vinyl releases. The 1996 compilation &quot;Edge of Twilight&quot; includes a corrected version of the song. Conflicting evidence sometimes reports that this defect exists on the original 1971 vinyl release of the album, with the opening note bending up as the tape comes up to speed – probably an engineering error.

In July 2004, the first eponymous album was re-released by Repertoire; in December 2005, they released &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;; in December 2006, &quot;Octopus&quot; in a mini-sleeve with the original design of Roger Dean was released, and in December 2007, German label Repertoire released &quot;Three Friends&quot; in a mini-sleeve with the original British release design. Although not widely distributed, these re-issues have been praised for their production quality and remastering. Before that, all first four albums have been re-released on Universal Japan label.

In 2005, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 35th anniversary, a series of digitally remastered and specially packaged CDs of their later albums were released by Derek Shulman&#x27;s company, DRT Entertainment. They all featured unreleased live tracks (of varying quality) as bonuses. Many of these albums (most notably &quot;In a Glass House&quot;) were previously difficult to purchase in North America without resorting to imports. The re-released albums are: &quot;In a Glass House&quot;, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, &quot;Free Hand,&quot; &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;The Missing Piece&quot;, the live album &quot;Playing the Fool&quot;, and &quot;Giant for a Day&quot;.

A reissue series on CD and, with bonus tracks, as digital downloads was begun in 2009/2010. In a 2009 interview Derek Shulman also indicated that plans were in the works to put out an animated film based on &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (this has yet to come to fruition). In 2011 the original mastertapes for &quot;Three Friends&quot; and &quot;Octopus&quot; were located and Alucard Music reissued each album with a bonus live performance of material from each respective album. Each album was remastered by Ray Shulman and Francis Kervorkian (both of whom worked on the 2009 remasters).

&quot;Free Hand&quot; and &quot;Interview&quot; both get re-issued in 2012 on CD/DVD &amp; Vinyl. The CD/DVD features a previously unreleased lost quadraphonic mix. The special 4.1 Surround Sound mix (audiophiles note it&#x27;s DTS 96/24 and Dolby Digital 48 kHz/24bit) has been adapted from the original Quad mixes. The band members have written new sleevenotes for both albums.

2012&#x27;s &quot;I Lost My Head - The Chrysalis Years&quot; is a 4-CD set rounding up all of Gentle Giant&#x27;s Chrysalis albums with bonus tracks including John Peel sessions, 7&quot; mixes, live tracks &amp; &#x27;b&#x27; sides etc.

In 2014, &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; was re-released as a CD/DVD set with new mixes by Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) from the multitrack masters. The DVD contains new 48 kHz/24-bit Stereo LPCM, DTS 96 kHz/24-bit 5.1, and Dolby AC3 5.1 mixes, as well as a 96 kHz/24-bit LPCM transfer of the original 1974 studio mix.

In 2017, &quot;Three Piece Suite&quot; was released, and focused on tracks from their first three albums (&quot;Gentle Giant&quot;, &quot;Acquiring the Taste&quot;, and &quot;Three Friends&quot;). These tracks were re-mixed by Steven Wilson from the available multi-track tapes. Some songs from the first three albums were not included in the set as the multi-tracks for those specific songs have been lost. The set was available as a CD of the re-mixed songs and a Blu-Ray disk. The Blu-ray disk had 96/24 Stereo LPCM and DTS-HD 5.1 Surround Sound versions of the re-mixed tracks, additional bonus tracks, instrumental versions of some tracks, and Original Album Mixes from Flat Transfers of Mint Condition Original LPs. There were also new video animations included on the 5.1 Surround tracks. This release came packaged as a single Digipack with the two disks, a 16-page booklet, new artwork and was approved by the band for release.

Their final album, &quot;Civilian,&quot; was scheduled to be reissued on CD and available to stream on 20 May 2022.

==Musical style==
Gentle Giant&#x27;s music was mostly composed by Kerry Minnear and Ray Shulman, with additional musical ideas contributed by Derek Shulman (who was also known to contribute entire songs). Lyrics were mostly written by Phil Shulman and Derek Shulman (Kerry Minnear wrote some lyrics) up until Phil&#x27;s departure following the release of &quot;Octopus&quot; (1972) – subsequent lyrics were mostly written by Derek Shulman, with help from Kerry Minnear. It shares several aspects with that of other progressive rock bands, including:

* multi-part vocal harmonies
* complex lyrics
* organisation into concept album form (on occasion)
* frequent changes in tempo
* frequent use of syncopation and non-standard time signatures, including polymeters (two or more time signatures played simultaneously)
* use of complex melodies, frequently contrasting harmonies with dissonance
* extensive use of instrumental and vocal counterpoint
* use of musical structures typically associated with classical music (for example, madrigal form on &quot;Knots&quot;, fugal exposition in &quot;On Reflection&quot;, occasional Early Music stylings and the consistent use of stated, exchanged and recapitulated musical themes exchanged between instruments)
* use of classical, brass band and percussion-section instrumentation not generally associated with rock music

However, it has been noted that in spite of the comparatively complex initial sound, Gentle Giant&#x27;s music is in fact fairly traditional in terms of harmony and features relatively few complex chords. In common with most 1970s progressive rock, Gentle Giant compositions are closer to early 20th century neoclassicism than to contemporary classical music (some Gentle Giant songs, such as &quot;Black Cat&quot;, &quot;Experience&quot; and &quot;So Sincere&quot;, do utilise more complicated modernist harmonics). In general, the band relied on sudden and unexpected compositional twists and turns to stimulate their audience, including:

* polyphony
* hocketing
* unusual chord progressions
* breaking up and tonally re-voicing patterns of initially simple chords (with the chords subtly altering from repetition to repetition)
* accelerating and decelerating duration of musical themes
* rapid and frequent key changes (sometimes within a single bar)
* division of vocal lines between different singers (including staggered rhythms)
* clever handling of transitions between sections (such as a hard-rock guitar riff being immediately substituted by a medieval choral)

<text>French North Africa (, sometimes abbreviated to ANF) is a term often applied to the three territories that were controlled by France in the North African Maghreb during the colonial era, namely Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In contrast to French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa which existed as federations of French colonies and administrative entities in their own right, French North Africa was never more than a term of convenience to refer to the three separately governed territories under different forms of colonial regime.

==History==
In the 19th century, the Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire, which had loosely controlled the area since the 16th century, left the region vulnerable to other forces. In 1830, French troops captured Algiers and from 1848 until independence in 1962, France treated Algeria as an integral part of France, the &quot;Métropole&quot; or metropolitan France. In subsequent decades, a substantial European settler population emerged in Algeria known as the &quot;Pieds-Noirs&quot;. Seeking to expand their influence beyond Algeria, the French established protectorates to the east and west of it. The French protectorate of Tunisia was established in 1881, following a swift military invasion, and the French protectorate in Morocco in 1912, following a prolonged military campaign. These lasted until 1956 when both protectorates gained full independence, Tunisia on 20 March and Morocco on 7 April.

French rule in North Africa was finally ended as a result of the Algerian War (1954–62) and the Évian Accords of March 1962 which enabled the Algerian independence referendum of July 1962. Algeria formally became independent the same month.

<doc id="762985" wikidata="Q3294109" url="?curid=762985" title="Mark Holland">
<text>Mark Holland (born October 16, 1974) is a Canadian politician who has served as Minister of Health since July 26, 2023. A member of the Liberal Party, Holland represents Ajax in the House of Commons. He has previously served as Government House Leader from 2021 to 2023, and as Chief Government Whip from 2018 to 2021.

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2004 federal election in the riding of Ajax—Pickering. Holland was re-elected in the 2006 and 2008 elections, but was defeated in 2011. He worked for the Heart and Stroke Foundation, before returning to politics to run in the 2015 election, where he was elected to represent Ajax.

==Background==
Holland was born on October 16, 1974, in Pickering, Ontario. Holland majored in political science and history at the University of Toronto and graduated in 1996. He worked as an assistant to Member of Parliament Dan McTeague and at the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration. He also worked for the Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

A lifelong resident of west Durham, Holland lives in Ajax.

== Career ==

=== Municipal politics ===
Holland served as a city councillor for the city of Pickering from 1997 to 2004, and as a councillor for the Regional Municipality of Durham from 2000 to 2004.

Holland created the Millennium Waterfront Committee in Pickering in 1998 and led the redevelopment of Pickering&#x27;s waterfront. He also founded the Region of Durham&#x27;s Youth Partnership Initiative, the City of Pickering&#x27;s Winterfest and was a member of the board of directors for Veridian Corporation. Holland was also a member of the Durham Region Police Services Board, past vice-chair of both the Ajax-Pickering Social Development Council and the Ajax-Pickering Block Parent program and a past member of Durham Region&#x27;s finance and administration committee. He continues to be a member of the Durham West Arts Centre and was one of their founding members.

=== Federal politics ===
Holland is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Ajax-Pickering from 2004 to 2011, and representing Ajax since 2015. He has served as vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee, vice-chair of the Public Safety and National Security Committee, critic for Natural Resources, critic for Public Works and Procurement, critic for the Canada Border Services Agency, associate critic for Treasury Board, as a member of the Finance Committee, Industry Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Government Operations Committee and on the Cities and Communities Caucus.

In Parliament, Holland brought up a private member&#x27;s bill to advocate for the cause of lowering the voting age. The bill stipulated that 16- to 18-year-olds be allowed to vote in federal elections encouraged provincial and municipal jurisdictions to allow the same. He asked that an elections unit be taught in high schools before elections take place, to inform students on current events and issues at debate. By raising this interest in youth first, at the election they will make more informed choices. Furthermore, voting would take place in schools, raising voter turnout. In October 2006, Holland re-introduced as a private members bill a former Liberal government bill to reform the animal cruelty sections of the Criminal Code of Canada, which have changed little since 1892.

Holland has been named by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as a member of the new &#x27;Rat Pack&#x27; and was voted by the Hill Times as the most effective Opposition MP in Question Period and the &#x27;Best Up-And-Comer&#x27; four times from 2006–2008. Conservative Minister Stockwell Day has referred to Holland as &#x27;Perry Mason on Steroids&#x27; and &#x27;the Caped Crusader&#x27; during their sometimes heated exchanges in the Public Safety and National Security meetings. CTV called Holland &quot;a one-man rat pack on a mission to change the hill&quot;. Macleans has labelled Holland – &#x27;Part Attack Dog – Part King Maker&#x27; for his going after Conservatives and for his role in the 2006 leadership campaign.

Aaron Wherry of Maclean&#x27;s Magazine spoke of Holland saying &quot;If you saw Kennedy in Montreal, Holland was inevitably not far behind. Already a favourite of some on Parliament Hill for his oratory skills and his impressive head of hair, Holland is a mere 32 years old – making him a potential leadership candidate for the next 30 years.&quot;

Holland supported Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s leadership bid for the federal Liberal Party and was Kennedy&#x27;s Ontario campaign chair. When Kennedy dropped off after the second ballot to support former Environment Minister Stéphane Dion, Holland went with him and was seen as key in building a bridge between the two camps. Holland was the Ontario co-chair of Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s 2008 leadership campaign.

On January 18, 2007, Holland was named the critic for Natural Resources in Dion&#x27;s shadow cabinet. He was subsequently named critic for Public Safety and National Security, a post he held until his defeat in 2011. In that capacity, he led the opposition criticism over handling of the G8 Summit, efforts to save the gun registry and opposition to the Conservative Party&#x27;s crime agenda. As a sharp and vocal critic of the government, the Conservatives dubbed him &quot;Public Enemy Number 1&quot; prior to the 2011 election, a fact Holland wore as &quot;a badge of honour&quot; citing other prominent Canadians the government targeted for disagreeing with their agenda. Holland was unseated by Chris Alexander, a former diplomat who ran as a Conservative. Holland has recently admitted that he attempted suicide after that defeat, saying &quot;&quot;I was told that I was toxic. The Conservatives hated me. No organization would hire me. My marriage failed. My space with my children was not in a good place and most particularly my passion — the thing I believed so ardently in ... the purpose of my life — was in ashes at my feet.&quot;

He became the director of health promotion and public affairs with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada following his 2011 defeat. He also served as the Heart and Stroke Foundation&#x27;s executive director for the Ontario Mission and national director of children and youth, before returning to federal politics in 2015.

In 2015, Holland was nominated the Liberal candidate for the new riding of Ajax, essentially the southern portion of his old riding, thus positioning him for a rematch against sitting MP Chris Alexander. As part of the Liberal surge in southern Ontario, he won back his seat with 56 percent of the vote, defeating Alexander by almost 12,000 votes.

In December 2015, Holland was announced as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Democratic Institutions. In January 2017, he was shifted to Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. In August 2018, he was promoted to the position of chief government whip, succeeding the previous whip, Member of Parliament for Honoré-Mercier Pablo Rodriguez.

<text>GECAS (GE Capital Aviation Services) was an Irish–American commercial aviation financing and leasing company. AerCap acquired the company from GE Capital on November 1, 2021.

GECAS was the largest commercial airline leasing/financing company in the world by number of aircraft. The company offered many aviation finance services, including aircraft leasing, aircraft lending, engine leasing, asset management, and aircraft consulting. In terms of aircraft leasing, GECAS purchased aircraft from manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing, and then leased them to airlines, typically for about eight years, and usually on dry lease contracts. GECAS also offered purchase leasebacks. The company had two global headquarters in Shannon, Ireland, and Norwalk, Connecticut. The company had over 575 employees and 26 offices throughout the world.

GECAS had a fleet of over 1,970 aircraft, operated by 270 clients in over 75 countries. GECAS&#x27; primary competitor was AerCap, with other competitors including Air Lease Corporation, Aviation Capital Group, BBAM and SMBC Aviation Capital.

GE Aviation, another GE subsidiary, was part of the CFM International joint venture with Safran. Previously, GECAS had a policy of exclusively selecting GE engines for 99% of its airliners, and had only eight Boeing 757s with Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce turbofans. As the Airbus A350 XWB did not select GE engines, GECAS would not order it without airline placement. However, the company finally leased the first A350 operated by Qatar Airways to diversify assets and reduce risk. GECAS also leases the Pratt &amp; Whitney-powered Bombardier Q400 and ATR 72. GE/CFM supports Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce and IAE engines.

==History==

In 1967, GE Credit Corporation (GECC), now GE Capital, signed its first aviation lease with Allegheny Airlines. The deal leased three McDonnell Douglas DC-9s to the Pittsburgh-based operator. In 1981, GECC&#x27;s Transportation &amp; Industrial platform began to co-invest with UK lenders on aircraft leases. Two years later, GECC completed its first non-US lease to Swissair. GECC purchased the California-based Polaris Aircraft Leasing Corporation in 1986. With the purchase of Chemical Bank in 1989, GECC would begin to crucially expand its global presence.

GECAS was officially formed in 1993 to manage the assets bought from the Irish-based Guinness Peat Aviation, GECC Transportation &amp; Industrial&#x27;s Aviation Group, and Polaris Aircraft Leasing. By 1996, the company owned the world&#x27;s largest leased fleet, and place its first speculative OEM order. In 1999, GECAS added engine leasing to its service offerings.

In 2000, GECAS acquired PK AirFinance to offer aircraft lending. The same year, the company also moved into the regional jet and widebody space with its first order for Boeing 777s. In 2002, the company began freighter conversions to further maximize the life of its narrowbody assets.

The acquisition of The Memphis Group in 2006 added airframe parts to GECAS&#x27;service portfolio. GECAS also owns a minority stake in Oxford Aviation Academy retained when it sold 80% (before dilution) of GECAT to Star Capital Partners in 2007.

In 2010, GECAS acquired AviaSolutions, offering aviation consulting as part of the company&#x27;s services. In 2015, GECAS took over the Irish-based Milestone Aviation Group to add helicopters and rotary aircraft to its leasing portfolio.

In 2016, GECAS was ranked as &quot;World&#x27;s Top Lessor&quot; by &quot;AirFinance Journal&quot; and &quot;Airline Economics&quot; magazines.

In September 2018, GE hired Goldman Sachs to review GECAS&#x27; strategy as its portfolio value declined since 2012 from $34.1 to $23.6 billion, evaluating a full sale or a company break-up like Guinness Peat Aviation from which it emerged in 1993.

==Services==
GECAS&#x27; successor &quot;AerCap&quot; maintains a portfolio of narrowbody and widebody passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft, regional jets, and turboprop aircraft from manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, Bombardier and ATR. Through its Milestone Aviation Group, GECAS also owns and leases AgustaWestland, Sikorsky and Airbus Eurocopter helicopters. Customers finance these aircraft through the following GECAS offerings:
* Operating leases
* Purchase leaseback agreements
* Secured loans
* Aircraft servicing

Additionally, GECAS&#x27;s successor &quot;AerCap&quot; buys, leases and finances aircraft engines from GE and CFM, as well as from manufacturers Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, IAE and Engine Alliance. GECAS provides the following for its engine pool:
* Operating leases
* Short-term leases
* Purchase leaseback agreements
* Secured loans
* Engine exchange
* Engine servicing

GECAS distributed re-certified engine and aircraft parts through its Asset Management Services group. The company maintains an inventory of parts from Airbus, Boeing, Douglas and Bombardier aircraft that have been overhauled, repaired or modified, and distributes these parts from warehouses in North America, Europe and Asia.

GECAS previously operated AviaSolutions, which provided aircraft consultancy services to airports, investors and financial institutions, governments and airlines. AviaSolutions advised clients on business development, route development, infrastructure planning, airline management, regulations, and various other projects.

==Merger with AerCap==
In March 2021, General Electric and AerCap announced an agreement to merge the two lessors.

The transaction simplifies GE and focuses it on its industrial core—Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare—while significantly reducing GE Capital assets and generating proceeds to further de-risk and de-lever. For the first quarter of 2021, in connection with signing the transaction agreement, GE will record an approximate $3 billion non-cash charge and report GECAS as a discontinued operation. At closing, the remainder of GE Capital, including Energy Financial Services (EFS) and the company’s run-off insurance operations, will transition to GE Corporate. This means GE will report industrial-only financials and move from three-column to simpler one-column financial statement reporting.

After the deal closes, GE intends to use the transaction proceeds and its existing cash sources to reduce debt by approximately $30 billion, for an expected total reduction of more than $70 billion since the end of 2018. GE also expects to continue to execute significant additional debt reduction and increase earnings to reach its Industrial leverage target of less than 2.5x net debt to EBITDA over the next few years.

In November 2021, AerCap announced the completion of a merger with GECAS.

<doc id="762987" wikidata="Q5594531" url="?curid=762987" title="Grand Excursion">
<text>The Grand Excursion was a promotional voyage by train and steamboat into the Upper Mississippi River valley, USA that first took place in June 1854. It marked the first railroad connection between the East Coast and the Mississippi River, and it included dignitaries such as former president Millard Fillmore. In 2004, 150 years later, the Grand Excursion route was retraced by both riverboats and a steam locomotive.

==The original Grand Excursion==
The original excursion of 1854 was organized to promote the opening of a new rail line between Chicago and Rock Island, Illinois. This line was the first railway link from the eastern United States to the Mississippi River, and thus a more than symbolic moment in westward expansion, allowing for commerce and westward immigration, and ultimately a complete rail line to the Pacific coast. 

The route took travelers overland from Chicago, Illinois to Rock Island, Illinois, then upriver to Saint Paul, Minnesota Territory on several steamships. Approximately 1,200 people took part in the Excursion, many of whom were noted reporters and distinguished residents from the Eastern United States. Among these were then-popular novelist Catharine Sedgwick and former president President Millard Fillmore, who was widely rumored to be considering another campaign for the Presidency. News of the planned trek spread widely in the months prior to it taking place, so it generated a fair amount of press attention. Along with &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, which was published around the same time, accounts of this journey have been widely credited with influencing people to visit and often settle in the region in the late 19th century.

The first leg of the journey was by rail, and took the visitors from Chicago to Rock Island, Illinois via the Rock Island Railroad. Then, passengers were transferred to several steam-powered paddlewheelers for the trek upriver. The steamboats stopped several times daily to load up on firewood, but still traveled fairly quickly—they unexpectedly appeared a day earlier than planned in St. Paul. Once in the area, many travelers hiked overland to see the Falls of St. Anthony, the only waterfall on the Mississippi River, in what is now Minneapolis. During a brief ceremony at the falls, a jar of water taken from the Atlantic Ocean was poured into the falls in a symbolic &quot;mingling of the waters.&quot; 

A repeat of the journey marking its 150th anniversary (sesquicentennial) ran from June 25 to July 5, 2004.

==The 2004 Grand Excursion==
The 2004 Grand Excursion retraced the route of the original trek, using several historic vehicles on the route. In addition to celebrating the 150th anniversary of the original event, it was used as a celebration of the reclamation of the Mississippi River. The river had become very polluted as the population of the region grew. Extensive efforts have been made to clean it up since the mid-20th century. The river remains fairly polluted, but it is much cleaner than it once was. It also celebrated the redevelopment of the riverfront areas for many communities. For many years, the riverfront area was neglected. In recent times, communities along the route have recognized the cultural importance of the riverfront, and have undertaken extensive redevelopment efforts.

A steam locomotive, the Milwaukee Road 261, pulled a collection of historic railroad cars on the route from Chicago to the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa. Steamboats (or at least boats with an appropriate appearance) then traveled up the river to the Twin Cities in Minnesota, stopping daily and often becoming part of other festivities planned in local communities. Some of the steamboats were initially delayed due to high water on the river, which prevented the tall ships from passing under bridges, but they soon caught up with the other boats. It included many stops at towns on the river that were along the route. Some of the stops included Dubuque, Iowa, Guttenberg, Iowa, and La Crosse, Wisconsin. Since 1854, extensive rail networks have been built, so the train headed by the Milwaukee 261 followed the flotilla upriver on nearby tracks. For a while, it was also joined by Canadian Pacific 2816.

Since they came a day early, there was little fanfare when original Grand Excursion boats arrived in Minnesota (then Minnesota Territory). St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly said the city would make up for that in 2004 by promising, &quot;Church bells will ring, cannons will fire, bands will play, flags will wave and the bridges will be decked with bunting and signs.&quot;

The boats participating in the 2004 Grand Excursion included: &quot;Anson Northrup&quot;, &quot;Celebration Belle&quot;, &quot;Delta Queen&quot;, &quot;Harriet Bishop&quot;, &quot;Julia Belle Swain&quot;, &quot;La Crosse Queen&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;, and &quot;Spirit of Peoria&quot;.

<doc id="762988" wikidata="Q863960" url="?curid=762988" title="Swarm intelligence">
<text>Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.

Swarm intelligence systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of &quot;intelligent&quot; global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.

The application of swarm principles to robots is called &quot;swarm robotics&quot; while &quot;swarm intelligence&quot; refers to the more general set of algorithms. &quot;Swarm prediction&quot; has been used in the context of forecasting problems. Similar approaches to those proposed for swarm robotics are considered for genetically modified organisms in synthetic collective intelligence.

== Models of swarm behavior ==
=== Boids (Reynolds 1987) ===

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates flocking. It was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference.
The name &quot;boid&quot; corresponds to a shortened version of &quot;bird-oid object&quot;, which refers to a bird-like object.

As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* separation: to avoid crowding local flockmates
* alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* cohesion: steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.

=== Self-propelled particles (Vicsek &quot;et al&quot;. 1995) ===

Self-propelled particles (SPP), also referred to as the &quot;Vicsek model&quot;, was introduced in 1995 by Vicsek &quot;et al.&quot; as a special case of the boids model introduced in 1986 by Reynolds. A swarm is modelled in SPP by a collection of particles that move with a constant speed but respond to a random perturbation by adopting at each time increment the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighbourhood. SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm. Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales, some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust. It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.

== Metaheuristics ==

Evolutionary algorithms (EA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), ant colony optimization (ACO) and their variants dominate the field of nature-inspired metaheuristics. This list includes algorithms published up to circa the year 2000. A large number of more recent metaphor-inspired metaheuristics have started to attract criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor. For algorithms published since that time, see List of metaphor-based metaheuristics.

Metaheuristics lack a confidence in a solution. When appropriate parameters are determined, and when sufficient convergence stage is achieved, they often find a solution that is optimal, or near close to optimum – nevertheless, if one does not know optimal solution in advance, a quality of a solution is not known. In spite of this obvious drawback it has been shown that these types of algorithms work well in practice, and have been extensively researched, and developed. On the other hand, it is possible to avoid this drawback by calculating solution quality for a special case where such calculation is possible, and after such run it is known that every solution that is at least as good as the solution a special case had, has at least a solution confidence a special case had. One such instance is Ant-inspired Monte Carlo algorithm for Minimum Feedback Arc Set where this has been achieved probabilistically via hybridization of Monte Carlo algorithm with Ant Colony Optimization technique.

=== Ant colony optimization (Dorigo 1992) ===

Ant colony optimization (ACO), introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation, is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony. ACO is a probabilistic technique useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs. Artificial &#x27;ants&#x27;—simulation agents—locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions. Natural ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated &#x27;ants&#x27; similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate for better solutions.

=== Particle swarm optimization (Kennedy, Eberhart &amp; Shi 1995) ===

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a global optimization algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an n-dimensional space. Hypotheses are plotted in this space and seeded with an initial velocity, as well as a communication channel between the particles. Particles then move through the solution space, and are evaluated according to some fitness criterion after each timestep. Over time, particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping which have better fitness values. The main advantage of such an approach over other global minimization strategies such as simulated annealing is that the large number of members that make up the particle swarm make the technique impressively resilient to the problem of local minima.

=== Artificial bee colony algorithm (Karaboga 2005) ===

Karaboga introduced ABC metaheuristic in 2005 as an answer to optimize numerical problems. Inspired by honey bee foraging behavior, Karaboga&#x27;s model had three components. The employed, onlooker, and scout. In practice, the artificial scout bee would expose all food source positions (solutions) good or bad. The employed bee would search for the shortest route to each position to extract the food amount (quality) of the source. If the food was depleted from the source, the employed bee would become a scout and randomly search for other food sources. Each source that became abandoned created negative feedback meaning, the answers found were poor solutions. The onlooker bees wait for employed bees to either abandon a source or give information that the source has a large quantity of food and is worth sending additional resources to. The more an onlooker bee is recruited, the more positive the feedback is meaning that the answer is likely a good solution.

=== Artificial Swarm Intelligence (2015) ===
Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is method of amplifying the collective intelligence of networked human groups using control algorithms modeled after natural swarms. Sometimes referred to as Human Swarming or Swarm AI, the technology connects groups of human participants into real-time systems that deliberate and converge on solutions as dynamic swarms when simultaneously presented with a question ASI has been used for a wide range of applications, from enabling business teams to generate highly accurate financial forecasts to enabling sports fans to outperform Vegas betting markets. ASI has also been used to enable groups of doctors to generate diagnoses with significantly higher accuracy than traditional methods. ASI has been used by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to help forecast famines in hotspots around the world.

==Applications==
Swarm Intelligence-based techniques can be used in a number of applications. The U.S. military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles. The European Space Agency is thinking about an orbital swarm for self-assembly and interferometry. NASA is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping. A 1992 paper by M. Anthony Lewis and George A. Bekey discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors. Conversely al-Rifaie and Aber have used stochastic diffusion search to help locate tumours. Swarm intelligence (SI) is increasingly applied in Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and by association to Intent-Based Networking (IBN), due to its ability to handle complex, distributed tasks through decentralized, self-organizing algorithms. Swarm intelligence has also been applied for data mining and cluster analysis. Ant-based models are further subject of modern management theory.

===Ant-based routing===
The use of swarm intelligence in telecommunication networks has also been researched, in the form of ant-based routing. This was pioneered separately by Dorigo et al. and Hewlett-Packard in the mid-1990s, with a number of variants existing. Basically, this uses a probabilistic routing table rewarding/reinforcing the route successfully traversed by each &quot;ant&quot; (a small control packet) which flood the network. Reinforcement of the route in the forwards, reverse direction and both simultaneously have been researched: backwards reinforcement requires a symmetric network and couples the two directions together; forwards reinforcement rewards a route before the outcome is known (but then one would pay for the cinema before one knows how good the film is). As the system behaves stochastically and is therefore lacking repeatability, there are large hurdles to commercial deployment. Mobile media and new technologies have the potential to change the threshold for collective action due to swarm intelligence (Rheingold: 2002, P175).

The location of transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks is an important engineering problem involving competing objectives. A minimal selection of locations (or sites) are required subject to providing adequate area coverage for users. A very different, ant-inspired swarm intelligence algorithm, stochastic diffusion search (SDS), has been successfully used to provide a general model for this problem, related to circle packing and set covering. It has been shown that the SDS can be applied to identify suitable solutions even for large problem instances.

Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. At Southwest Airlines a software program uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. &quot;The pilot learns from his experience what&#x27;s the best for him, and it turns out that that&#x27;s the best solution for the airline,&quot; Douglas A. Lawson explains. As a result, the &quot;colony&quot; of pilots always go to gates they can arrive at and depart from quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. &quot;We can anticipate that it&#x27;s going to happen, so we&#x27;ll have a gate available,&quot; Lawson says.

===Crowd simulation===
Artists are using swarm technology as a means of creating complex interactive systems or simulating crowds.

====Instances====

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy made use of similar technology, known as Massive (software), during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

&quot;Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice&quot; was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of groups of fish and birds using the Boids system.

Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman Returns&quot; also made use of swarm technology for showing the movements of a group of bats.
Airlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane. Southwest Airlines researcher Douglas A. Lawson used an ant-based computer simulation employing only six interaction rules to evaluate boarding times using various boarding methods.(Miller, 2010, xii-xviii).

===Human swarming===
Networks of distributed users can be organized into &quot;human swarms&quot; through the implementation of real-time closed-loop control systems. Developed by Louis Rosenberg in 2015, human swarming, also called artificial swarm intelligence, allows the collective intelligence of interconnected groups of people online to be harnessed. The collective intelligence of the group often exceeds the abilities of any one member of the group. 

Stanford University School of Medicine published in 2018 a study showing that groups of human doctors, when connected together by real-time swarming algorithms, could diagnose medical conditions with substantially higher accuracy than individual doctors or groups of doctors working together using traditional crowd-sourcing methods. In one such study, swarms of human radiologists connected together were tasked with diagnosing chest x-rays and demonstrated a 33% reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to the traditional human methods, and a 22% improvement over traditional machine-learning. 

The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine released a preprint in 2021 about the diagnosis of MRI images by small groups of collaborating doctors. The study showed a 23% increase in diagnostic accuracy when using Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) technology compared to majority voting.

===Swarm grammars===
Swarm grammars are swarms of stochastic grammars that can be evolved to describe complex properties such as found in art and architecture. These grammars interact as agents behaving according to rules of swarm intelligence. Such behavior can also suggest deep learning algorithms, in particular when mapping of such swarms to neural circuits is considered.

===Swarmic art===
In a series of works, al-Rifaie et al. have successfully used two swarm intelligence algorithms—one mimicking the behaviour of one species of ants (&quot;Leptothorax acervorum&quot;) foraging (stochastic diffusion search, SDS) and the other algorithm mimicking the behaviour of birds flocking (particle swarm optimization, PSO)—to describe a novel integration strategy exploiting the local search properties of the PSO with global SDS behaviour. The resulting hybrid algorithm is used to sketch novel drawings of an input image, exploiting an artistic tension between the local behaviour of the &#x27;birds flocking&#x27;—as they seek to follow the input sketch—and the global behaviour of the &quot;ants foraging&quot;—as they seek to encourage the flock to explore novel regions of the canvas. The &quot;creativity&quot; of this hybrid swarm system has been analysed under the philosophical light of the &quot;rhizome&quot; in the context of Deleuze&#x27;s &quot;Orchid and Wasp&quot; metaphor.

A more recent work of al-Rifaie et al., &quot;Swarmic Sketches and Attention Mechanism&quot;, introduces a novel approach deploying the mechanism of &#x27;attention&#x27; by adapting SDS to selectively attend to detailed areas of a digital canvas. Once the attention of the swarm is drawn to a certain line within the canvas, the capability of PSO is used to produce a &#x27;swarmic sketch&#x27; of the attended line. The swarms move throughout the digital canvas in an attempt to satisfy their dynamic roles—attention to areas with more details—associated with them via their fitness function. Having associated the rendering process with the concepts of attention, the performance of the participating swarms creates a unique, non-identical sketch each time the &#x27;artist&#x27; swarms embark on interpreting the input line drawings. In other works, while PSO is responsible for the sketching process, SDS controls the attention of the swarm.

In a similar work, &quot;Swarmic Paintings and Colour Attention&quot;, non-photorealistic images are produced using SDS algorithm which, in the context of this work, is responsible for colour attention.

The &quot;computational creativity&quot; of the above-mentioned systems are discussed in through the two prerequisites of creativity (i.e. freedom and constraints) within the swarm intelligence&#x27;s two infamous phases of exploration and exploitation.

Michael Theodore and Nikolaus Correll use swarm intelligent art installation to explore what it takes to have engineered systems to appear lifelike.

<text>The Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF) is the largest stand-alone comedy festival and the largest international comedy festival in the world. First held in 1987, it takes place annually in Melbourne over four weeks, typically starting in March and running through to April. The Melbourne Town Hall has served as the festival hub, but performances are held in many venues throughout the city.

MICF also produces three flagship development programs: Raw Comedy, Australia&#x27;s biggest open mic competition; Class Clowns, a national comedy competition for high school students; and Deadly Funny, an Indigenous comedy competition that celebrates the unique humour of Indigenous Australians. Awards are given for the best acts of the development programs as well as other categories of performances. The festival also undertakes an annual national roadshow, showcasing festival highlights in regional towns across Australia.

==History==
The festival was founded in 1986 by John Pinder and his business partner Roger Evans. According to Pinder, the idea of holding an international comedy festival originated in the early 1980s. In 1986, Pinder persuaded the Victorian Tourism Commission to fund an overseas trip in order to visit other international comedy festivals and investigate the possibility of holding a festival in Melbourne. Pinder became convinced it would work, and after his return he wrote a report for the state government, which they accepted. The inaugural festival was launched in 1987 at a media conference hosted by Barry Humphries (as Sir Les Patterson) and Peter Cook.

Traditionally the festival would open on or around April Fool&#x27;s Day (1 April), though it now generally begins in mid-to-late March and runs for roughly four weeks. Its first year, in 1987, featured 56 separate shows, including performances by the Doug Anthony All Stars, Wogs Out of Work, Gerry Connolly, Los Trios Ringbarkus, and Rod Quantock. By 1999, it contained over 120 shows and was being attended by some 350,000 patrons annually. In 2010, it played host to a record (at the time) 369 shows and 4,947 performances both local and international, including artists from the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland and China. In addition, it achieved an attendance of over 508,000 and its highest-ever box office revenue of A$10.9  million, ranking it as Australia&#x27;s largest cultural event. Activities were originally centred around the Universal and Athenaeum Theatres but in the early 1990s, the MICF shifted its venue to the newly refurbished Melbourne Town Hall, which has remained the festival hub. Soon after this, it spread out further to include an independently produced program at the Melbourne Trades Hall as well. In 2010, for the first time, the Festival also ran the Trades Hall venue.

In 2006, the opening of the festival was delayed due to the Festival Melbourne that occurred as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne.

The 2020 festival was cancelled in its entirety due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and the extension of restrictions relating to efforts to stem the spread of the pandemic in Australia.

==Description==
The MICF generally begins in mid-to-late March and runs for roughly four weeks. It is one of the three largest international comedy festivals in the world, behind Edinburgh&#x27;s Fringe Festival and ahead of Montreal&#x27;s Just For Laughs.

Although it is mainly a vehicle for stand-up and cabaret acts, its programme has also featured sketch shows, plays, improvisational theatre, debates, musical shows, and art exhibitions. There is also a tradition for experimenting with unusual comedy venues, such as Rod Quantock&#x27;s &quot;Bus&quot; tours and the similar &quot;Storming Mount Albert By Tram&quot;, which used buses and trams respectively as mobile theatres in which the audience members were also passengers.

The MICF plays host to hundreds of local and international artists; in 2018, the festival listed over 550 shows and 6,700 performances (including more than 160 free performances) by 3,500 artists. Although it is mainly a vehicle for stand-up and cabaret acts, the festival has also included sketch shows, plays, improvisational theatre, debates, musical shows and art exhibitions. The televised Gala is one of the festival&#x27;s flagship event, showcasing short performances from many headline and award-winning comics. Other popular events include The Great Debate, a televised comedy debate, the Opening Night Super Show, and Upfront, a night of performances exclusively featuring female comedians.

The Moosehead Benefit is held on the last night of the festival to raise funds for the Moosehead Awards, which provide grants to support emerging comedians.

Following the end of the festival in Melbourne various local and international comedians join the MICF Roadshow, which spends several months touring regional Australia and in 2010, Singapore.

==Special events==
In addition to over 200 nightly shows which play during the festival, there are a number of special one-off events. The best-known of these is the Comedy Festival Gala, which showcases short acts from many headlines and award-winning comedians performing shows at that year&#x27;s festival. It has become known as the festival&#x27;s flagship event and typically sells out months in advance. It is typically hosted by well-known popular comedians. Headline acts at the Gala have included world-famous comics Arj Barker, Eddie Ifft, Adam Hills, Russell Kane, Stephen K Amos, Mike Wilmot and Rich Hall. The Gala is filmed and broadcast at a later date during the festival on the ABC. Since 1995 the Gala has been a charity event, with all proceeds from the live performance and the screening going to Oxfam Australia.

The Great Debate has been an annual event since 1989 and has been televised variously on Network Ten, Nine Network and currently airs on ABC. The comedy debate features two teams of comedians facing off loosely in the structure of a formal debate over humorous topics such as &quot;Laughter is Better Than Sex&quot;, &quot;Coming First is All That Matters&quot; and &quot;Food is better than sex&quot;. The winning team is chosen by audience applause. Since 1994, the festival has produced Upfront, a night exclusively featuring female comedians which routinely sells out.

==Awards==

Each year, the MICF ends its Melbourne run by recognising the most outstanding shows and performers with a series of awards.

The Age Critics&#x27; Award was presented to the best local act between 2001 and 2010, as selected by reviewers at the Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;.

The award for the most outstanding show of the festival is the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Award. It was called the Barry Award until the 2019 festival, named after Barry Humphries. However, due to comments about transgender people, including describing transgenderism as &quot;a fashion&quot;, Humphries&#x27; name was removed from the prize and it was renamed.

The Golden Gibbo was established in 2004 in honour of Australian comedian Lynda Gibson, who died of cancer in 2004. It celebrates a local, independent act that &quot;bucks trends and pursues the artist&#x27;s idea more strongly than it pursues any commercial lure&quot; The recipient of the Golden Gibbo receives in cash, and the Golden Gibbo statue (&quot;which looks suspiciously like a bottle of shitty red wine&quot;). The award is funded by the Moosehead Benefit, which is staged on the last night of the festival.

 the other MICF awards include:
*Best Newcomer Award (since 2000), presented to the festival&#x27;s best first-time performer as a part of its Emerging Talent Program; winner receives a trip to the Brighton Comedy Festival in Brighton, England
*Piece of Wood Award (since 1998), the comics&#x27; choice award; voted on by all previous winners; so named because the award is literally a piece of wood.
* Directors&#x27; Choice Award (since 2005); recognises an outstanding show that missed out on any other prize; awarded by the MICF director, in consultation with other visiting festival directors
* People&#x27;s Choice Award (established in 2010 as the Bulmers People&#x27;s Choice Award), determined by ticket sales
* Pinder Prize (since 2016); established in honour of New Zealand-born comedy producer John Pinder; supports a performer to travel to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where they can perform a show at Assembly Theatres, where Pinder was responsible for presenting many Australian comics
* RAW Comedy Award (since 1996); the result of a national open mic competition, with heats all over the country taking place from January each year, and culminating in the National Grand Final in Melbourne in April 
* Deadly Funny Award (since 2007); for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander comics
* Class Clowns winner (since 1996); for secondary school students from Years 9-12
* Funny Tonne Award (since 2005); one for the fans: for &quot;the person who saw the most festival shows and wrote the most reviews&quot;

===Mooseheads===

In addition to the MICF awards, the Brian McCarthy Memorial Trust, which was established in 1987 in honour of Melbourne comedian, actor and fringe comedy producer Brian McCarthy, who died in an accident. Funds are raised by the Moosehead Benefit on the last night of MICF, and the trust gives grants to help support emerging comedians. In recent years it has supported up to six comedians each year by grants which pay the MICF registration fee, the first of venue rental, up to A$2,500 for creative support, and up to A$2,000 towards accommodation costs if the recipient lives outside of Melbourne.

==Advertising==
From 1988 to 2018, cartoonist Michael Leunig designed the artwork for the festival program and other materials such as advertising posters. In 2019, Leunig was replaced by Judy Horacek, following his recent controversial works on vaccines and marriage equality. Horacek will remain as the illustrator for the festival until at least 2020.

==Views on the festival==
Australian comic Peter Helliar says that performing in Melbourne is more fun for comedians because there is less pressure involved than in Edinburgh, where there is greater competition to gain an audience. Journalist Simon Fanshawe describes Melbourne as &quot;the festival where the comedians go to play ... the most relaxed, least fevered and probably the most audience-friendly of all the festivals.&quot;

Lorin Clarke, a Melbourne-based writer and director of comedy theatre, suggested that shows self-produced by Australian comedians have great difficulty competing against shows featuring international comics which are produced by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Clarke argues that this conflict of interest stifles creativity.

<text>James Relly ( – ) was a Welshman, Methodist minister and mentor of John Murray who spread Universalism in the United States.

==Biography==
Relly was born at Jeffreyston, Pembrokeshire, Wales. He attended the Pembroke Grammar School, came under the influence of George Whitefield, probably in the latter&#x27;s first tour of Wales in 1741, and became one of his preachers. His first station was at Rhyddlangwraig near Narberth; and in 1747 he made a report of a missionary tour to Bristol, Bath, Gloucestershire, and Birmingham. He broke, however, with Whitefield on doctrinal grounds - his views on the certainty of salvation being regarded as antinomian - and is known to have been in controversy with John Wesley in 1756. In that year, at Carrickfergus, he delivered, in opposition to Wesley, a &#x27;pointless harangue about hirelings and false prophets&#x27;. On 2 April 1761 Wesley writes of him and others as &#x27;wretches&#x27; who &#x27;call themselves Methodists&#x27; being really antinomian.

About the same time he adopted Universalism, which he viewed as a logical consequence of the universal efficacy of the death of Christ. He settled in London as a preacher at Coachmakers&#x27; Hall, Addle Street, Wood Street. In 1764 a chancery action was brought against him by a Yorkshire lady, who had given him a sum of money and executed a deed securing to him an annuity of £5. It was alleged that Relly had fraudulently obtained these benefits while the grantor was in a state of religious frenzy. Under an order of the court the deed was cancelled and the money refunded. Shortly afterwards Relly removed to a meeting-house in Bartholomew Close (formerly presbyterian), which had just been vacated by Wesley. Here he remained till midsummer 1769, when the lease expired. He then secured (October 1769) a meeting-house in Crosby Square (formerly presbyterian), where he continued to preach till his death, but his cause did not thrive, and he had no immediate successor in this country.

A portion from Charles Buck&#x27;s &quot;Definition of All Theological Terms and Every Article in the System of Divinity&quot;, published about 1820, describes Relly and his theology this way:

He believed that Christ as Mediator was so united to mankind, that his actions were theirs, his obedience and sufferings theirs; and, consequently, that he has as fully restored the whole human race to the divine favour, as if all had obeyed and suffered in their own persons; and upon this persuasion he preached a finished salvation, called by the apostle Jude, &quot;The common salvation.&quot; Many of his followers are removed to the world of spirits, but a branch still survives, and meets at the chapel in Windmill-street, Moorfields, London; where there are different brethren who speak. They are not observers of ordinances, such as water-baptism and the sacrament; professing to believe only in one baptism, which they call an immersion of the mind or conscience into truth by the teaching of the Spirit of God; and by the same Spirit they are enabled to feed on Christ as the bread of life, professing that in and with Jesus they possess all things. They inculcate and maintain good works for necessary purposes; but contend that the principal and only works which ought to be attended to, is the doing real good without religious ostentation; that to relieve the miseries and distresses of mankind according to our ability, is doing more real good than the superstitious observance of religious ceremonies. In general they appear to believe that there will be a resurrection to life, and a resurrection to condemnation; that believers only will be among the former, who as first fruits, and kings and priests, will have part in the first resurrection, and shall reign with Christ in his kingdom of the millennium; that unbelievers who are after raised, must wait the manifestation of the Saviour of the world, under that condemnation of conscience which a mind in darkness and wrath must necessarily feel; that believers, called kings and priests, will be made the medium of communication to their condemned brethren; and like Joseph to his brethren, though he spoke roughly to them, in reality overflowed with affection and tenderness; that ultimately every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that in the Lord they have righteousness and strength; and thus every enemy shall be subdued to the kingdom and glory of the Great Mediator.

One of his converts in 1770 was John Murray, the founder of Universalist churches in America.

Relly is said to have shown much natural ability and a generous disposition, under a rough manner. He died in London, England on 25 April 1778 and was interred in the baptist burial ground, Maze Pond, Southwark; the inscription on his tombstone represents him as &#x27;aged 56 years&#x27;. Two elegies were written by admirers. He left a widow and one daughter, who was living in 1808 and had issue. John Relly Beard was named after him, but was not a descendant. Relly&#x27;s portrait was twice engraved.

==Publications==
His chief publications, besides single sermons, were: 
*&quot;Remarks on a pamphlet, intitled, A dialogue between a true Methodist and an erroneous Methodist&quot;, (1751), author given as &quot;Philadelphus&quot;
*&quot;Salvation Compleated: and Secured in Christ, as the Covenant of the People&quot;, (1753)

<text>The County Medical Examiners is an American goregrind band who, in their own words, exist for the sole purpose of recreating the sound of early Carcass albums. The band is also known to do no live shows at all. All of the current members have graduated with an MD in medical school or are currently taking medical school classes, hence the name of the band.

==History==
The County Medical Examiners were formed in 2001. The band&#x27;s original line up consisted of Dr. Morton Fairbanks on guitar/vocals, Dr. Jack Putnam on drums/vocals, and Michelle Hayes on bass/vocals. Michelle Hayes was, according to Dr. Fairbanks in an old interview on thecountymedicalexaminers.com, first exposed to the band when, as part of her probation due to a DUI charge, she toured the morgue where Dr. Fairbanks worked. Soon after they got together and recorded the EP &quot;Fetid Putrescent Whiffs&quot;, which saw limited release. The band recorded their debut full-length for Razorback Records, &quot;Forensic Fugues and Medicolegal Medleys&quot;. Not long after the album&#x27;s release Michelle left the band to devote her time to medical school, and she was replaced by friend and colleague Dr. Guy Radcliffe, who is reportedly around 60 years of age. The current line-up went on to record a split LP, an EP, and a second full-length album, &quot;Olidous Operettas&quot;.

TCME released their Relapse Records debut, Olidous Operettas, in January 2007. The CD, which took more than a year and a half to write and record since all three band members live in different states, features eight tracks. Dr. Fairbanks described the effort as &quot;somewhere between Symphonies of Sickness and Necroticism-era Carcass&quot; and &quot;not something you would want to put on before church.&quot; What makes the disc even more distinctive is that &quot;it will be a scented-face CD, which essentially means it will be scratch and sniff-able,&quot; he said. &quot;Our CD will smell like rotten meat.&quot;

For a while, the identity of the band members were shrouded in mystery, as they used pseudonyms to avoid the wrath of hospital administration and fan attention. In a 2012 interview with Pitchfork, Exhumed&#x27;s Matt Widener admitted that the band was his side project, which he created &quot;to take the Carcass clone phenomenon to its extreme conclusion [...] Eventually my plan was to even start looking like them, then release their album with just one note changed from each riff. But that&#x27;s a lot of people to piss off in the name of a weird experiment, so I never really followed through.&quot;

<doc id="762999" wikidata="Q1132654" url="?curid=762999" title="Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle">
<text>The United States Navy Mk 12 MOD 0/1/H Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a designated marksman rifle that was in service with United States Special Operations Forces in the designated marksman role until 2017, also designed to be shorter than standard weapons. SPR initially stood for &quot;Special Purpose Receiver&quot; as it referred to an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades), but that nomenclature changed to &quot;Special Purpose Rifle&quot; as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system. 

The SPR was eventually type-classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. The weapon was developed by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division for US military special operations units.

The rifle is designed to fire semi-automatically, although it has the option to fire in full auto in case of emergencies.

==History==
Early experience in influencing the SPR was from American forces deployed in Somalia when they used different optics, ammo, triggers, free float hand guards and rail systems for their rifles.

The SPR concept was originally proposed by Mark Westrom, president of ArmaLite, while working at Rock Island Arsenal in 2000. Its design group included John Noveske and Steve Holland. The program was an outgrowth of the desire by both US Army and Navy special operations forces for a rifle with greater effective range than an M4 carbine but shorter than an SR-25. The SPR program appears to have grown out of both the SOPMOD Block I program, and the U.S. Navy SEALs Recon Rifle, a 16&quot; flat-topped M16 carbine. Early models included the SPR, SPR/A, and SPR/B. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division expanded on the Recon Rifle.

Initial tests were conducted in October 2000 in order to determine any weaknesses with the first SPR rifles manufactured. From 2000 to 2001, all errors were corrected for the second production of SPRs. The first SPRs were issued in 2002.

The Mk 12 Mod 0 was only used by the US Army Special Forces while the Mk 12 Mod 1 was used by the Rangers, US Navy SEALs and Special Tactical Teams. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) also used the Mk 12 Mod 1 towards the end of the war in Iraq and extensively during the war in Afghanistan. They were mostly deployed as designated marksman rifles (DMR). The Mk 12 Mod H was used primarily by Army SOF and Special Mission Units (SMU), and featured a retrofit upper of the Mod 0 with PRI Gen3 round handguards and a shorter RECCE rail to replace the original Swan Sleeve, reducing weight, and either Douglas or Noveske barrels made with the SPR profile in a rifle length gas system. 

The Mk 12 was phased out of service in 2017.

==Design==

===Upper receiver===
The majority of the SPR upper receivers were initially supplied by Colt, with others being produced by Diemaco (now Colt Canada). Colt had been outsourcing parts of its production to Diemaco for several years, then purchased Diemaco in February 2005. It is unclear whether the upper receivers for the later SPRs came solely from ArmaLite, or were a mix of receivers from ArmaLite and Colt/Diemaco. 

All of these upper receivers are flat-topped, but have been seen with either the old-style teardrop forward assist or the newer round style.

===Lower receiver===
When the SPR program was still just an upper receiver assembly (and not a complete rifle), Crane assembled all of its prototypes using either M16A1 or M4A1 lower receivers, because the full auto trigger group in these lower receivers provided a consistent pull while the more common 3-round burst trigger groups didn&#x27;t. 

While a number of trigger options were tried in the end, the Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC) 2-stage trigger was finally decided upon as the standard. Most of the obsolete M16A1 lower receivers were turned into NSWC Crane for disposal.

===Barrel===
An 18-inch (457 mm) (MOD 0/1) or 16-inch (406 mm) (MOD H) threaded-muzzle match-grade free floating stainless steel heavy barrel with a 1:7 (178 mm) rifling twist ratio is standard for the SPR. 

The barrels are manufactured by Douglas Barrels with a unique contour that reduced weight but maintained rigidity for accuracy. An OPS Inc. muzzle brake and collar (to align the OPS Inc. 12th Model Suppressor) is installed with the barrel. 

These barrels were designed to take advantage of the new Mk 262 cartridge, which uses a 77-grain (5 g) bullet.

Some early Mod H&#x27;s were made using Noveske barrels but eventually switched back to the Douglas barrels commonly shared across the other variants. 

===Stock===
SPRs have been seen with M16A1 or M16A2 fixed buttstocks, telescoping M4 buttstocks, and the Crane Enhanced telescoping buttstock. The rifles are compatible with any type of stock system developed for the M16.

===Handguards===
In all cases a free-floating forearm is used, which does not touch the barrel directly. This increases the accuracy of the weapon by removing vibration and pressure exerted on the barrel by the rest of the gun. The first SPRs used PRI Gen I or Gen II carbon-fiber free-float tubes. The SPR/A, SPR/B, and MK 12 MOD 1 all use the Knights Armament Company M4 Match Free-Floating Rail Adapter System, KAC part number 99167. 

The Mk 12 MOD 0/H uses PRI Gen III free-float tubes. The Gen I and Gen II Freefloat Forearms are combined with the Atlantic Research Marketing Systems #38 SPR MOD Sleeve, while the Gen III Freefloat Forearm, due to its larger barrel nut, only works with the ARMS #38 SPR PEQ-2-3.

===Accessories===
The original SPR used an early PRI flip-up front sight with an elevation dial, which has since been discontinued. The Mk 12 MOD 0/H uses the current PRI flip-up front sight. The SPR/A, SPR/B, and Mk 12 MOD 1 use the KAC rail forend flip-up front sight, KAC part number 99051. The SPR and Mk 12 MOD 0/H use the ARMS #40 flip up rear sight. The rest of the models use the KAC 600 meter flip up rear, KAC part number 98474.

Due to the relative modularity of the system, optics (as well as almost everything else) can be mounted according to the operator&#x27;s wishes. However, SPRs are most often seen with a 3.5–10×40 mm Leupold LR M3 (SPR/A), a 2.5–8×36 mm TS-30 (SPR/B), or a 3–9×36 mm TS-30 A2 (Mk 12 MOD 0/1) Mid Range/Tactical Illuminated Reticle Dayscope. Night vision devices can also be attached. These scopes usually come with flip open dust covers and a honeycomb anti-glare anti-reflection device. Given Nightforce Optics&#x27; NAVSPECWAR contract, it is believed that many NAVSPECWAR issued SPRs will use the Nightforce 2.5-10x42 NXS scope.

A long accessory rail, called a Swan Sleeve (ARMS SPR MOD or ARMS #38 SPR PEQ-2-3), manufactured by ARMS, is installed, running the length of the rifle. The SPR/A and SPR/B both used the KAC M4 Match FF RAS, KAC part number 99167. Two ARMS #22 Throwlever 30 mm steel rings are used to mount the dayscope. The SPR/A, SPR/B, and Mk 12 MOD 1 use ARMS #22 high rings, while due to the increased height from the SWAN Sleeve, the SPR and Mk 12 MOD 0/H use ARMS #22 medium rings. An under-the-handguard ARMS #32 Throwlever mount is used to mount the Harris bipod (the ARMS #42 Throwlever mount is used to mount the Versa-Pod); this features a quick release action. Nightforce Ultralite 1.375&quot; rings were also alternate issued rings, primarily with Nightforce riflescopes from Crane.

Originally the relatively expensive Parker-Hale swivel bipods were used, but were taken off the system after the initial SPR. Currently, a Harris swivel model bipod is typically used with the SPR, and is sometimes seen with a KMW Pod-Loc tension adjustment device. As mentioned above, the bipod is mounted via an ARMS #32 throwlever device attached to the bottom rail of the rifle&#x27;s forearm. The ARMS mount is used on both the MOD 0 and MOD 1.

The OPS Inc. 12th Model SPR Muzzle Brake Suppressor threads directly onto the OPS Inc. muzzle brake and uses the collar to stay centered for Mk 12 MOD 0/1 models. The first 100 suppressors were made in RD Systems in South Beloit, Illinois.

In 2014, Ops, Inc stopped manufacturing this model of suppressors. The equivalent product is currently manufactured by Allen Engineering Co as the AEM5. The AEM5 is essentially the same suppressor design and actually built by the same individual, Ron Allen, who previously fabricated the 12th model suppressor for Ops, Inc. Other models of this suppressor are also produced that look the same from the outside, but are fundamentally different suppressors.

===Ammunition===

The SPR is not used to fire standard issue 5.56mm M855A1, M193 ball, or M856 tracer ammunition. Due to the limits in terminal performance and relatively poor accuracy of the 62-grain (4 g) M855 ball, the Mk 262 Open Tip Match (OTM) round was developed and manufactured by Black Hills Ammunition as a more accurate round for the SPR. The first production batches were designated Mk 262 MOD 0 and used a Sierra MatchKing 77-grain (5 g) Hollow Point Boat Tail bullet without a cannelure (crimping groove). 

Black Hills then approached the Nosler bullet manufacturing company, who made a similar OTM bullet, and Nosler agreed to supply cannelured bullets to Black Hills.

The newer load was designated Mk 262 MOD 1. Recently, Sierra added a minimal cannelure to its bullet, and this has since replaced the Nosler bullet in the current versions of Mk 262 MOD 1. In late 2014, Sierra introduced a tipped version of this bullet which adds a polymer tip to improve ballistics. 

This new bullet was found exclusively in an upgraded version of the Black Hills Ammo MK262 MOD 1 loading, but this bullet has been released by Sierra to reloaders prior to the end of 2014. The Sierra part number for this bullet is 7177.

==Clones==
The Mk 12 SPR has been manufactured by various firearms companies as clone rifles after the Mk 12 was phased out.

Centurion Arms manufactures clones of the Mk 12. Troy Industries made a retro Mk 12 for sale in 2017. Oberland Arms released a version of the Mk 12 in 2019.

Palmetto State Armory released clones of the Mk 12 Mod 0, Mod 1, and Mod H in 2023 known as the Sabre Mk 12. Precision Reflex Inc unveiled a Mk 12 rifle chambered in .308 Winchester in SHOT SHOW 24 in January 2024.

<doc id="763002" wikidata="Q40021" url="?curid=763002" title="North American T-6 Texan">
<text>The North American Aviation T-6 Texan is an American single-engined advanced trainer aircraft used to train pilots of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy, Royal Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force and other air forces of the British Commonwealth during World War II and into the 1970s. 

Designed by North American Aviation, the T-6 is known by a variety of designations depending on the model and operating air force. The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) and USAAF designated it as the AT-6, the United States Navy the SNJ, and British Commonwealth air forces the Harvard, the name by which it is best known outside the US. Starting in 1948, the new United States Air Force (USAF) designated it the T-6, with the USN following in 1962. 

The T-6 Texan remains a popular warbird used for airshow demonstrations and static displays. It has also been used many times to simulate various historical aircraft, including the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero. A total of 15,495 T-6s of all variants were built.

==Development==

The Texan&#x27;s ancestry goes back to the North American NA-16 prototype which was first flown on 1 April 1935. In 1935, NAA submitted this design for the U.S. Army Air Corps Basic Trainer Competition. NAA also targeted the export market.

Modified as the NA-26, it was submitted as an entry for a USAAC &quot;Basic Combat Trainer&quot; aircraft competition in March 1937. Based on the NA-18, but with a foot longer wingspan, it was the first of the NA-16 series with retractable gear. It was similar to the BT-9, but with a larger engine, the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp, and could accommodate two guns.

With minor alterations, 177 unarmed NA-36s would enter service as the BC-1 with a R-1340-47 engine from 9 June 1937. Roughly 30 were modified as BC-1-I instrument trainers. The BC-1A (NA-55-1) followed as an armed version, primarily for Air Corps Reserve and National Guard units, and the 83 built could be equipped with a machine gun on the nose, and a flexible gun in the rear cockpit.

The US Navy received 40 NA-28 aircraft based on the BT-9, which it designated the NJ-1, as well as 16 NA-52s, designated the SNJ-1, 36 NA-65 as SNJ-2s, and 25 NA-79 also as SNJ-2s.

In March 1937, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation of Australia purchased an NA-32 (NA-16-1A, with fixed undercarriage) and an NA-33 (NA-16-2K with retractible undercarriage) along with a manufacturing license. The first CAC Wirraway, based on the NA-33, flew on 27 March 1939, of which 755 were built.

In August 1937, Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K. purchased a single NA-16, NA-16-4R (NA-37), powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985-9CG, including manufacturing rights. A second N-16, NA-16-4RW (NA-47), powered by a smaller Wright engine, was ordered in December 1937. After being evaluated by the Imperial Japanese Navy, Kyusu and K.K. Watanabe Tekkosho chose to ignore the NAA design almost entirely, and built 176 of the somewhat similar K10W1 from 1941 to 1942 which the Allies gave the code name &quot;Oak&quot;. After WWII, the Japanese Air Self Defense Force operated 195 Texans (9 T-6Ds, 11 T-6Fs, and 175 T-6Gs) and the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force operated 62 (10 SNJ-4s, 41 SNJ-5s, and 11 SNJ-6s)

According to Dan Hagedorn, &quot;the BC-1A series may be regarded as the true beginning of the modern AT-6 series&quot;. In December 1938, the British Commonwealth started receiving the first of 400 Harvard Mark Is (NA-49), for use in the Central Flying School. They were powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-S3H1 Wasp. In May 1939, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) ordered 30 Harvard Mark Is (NA-61). Then in November 1939, the British Purchasing Commission ordered the first of eventually 1275 Harvard Mark IIs (NA-66, NA-75, NA-76, and NA-81) for the Royal Air Force and RCAF.

On 23 April 1939, NAA received a contract for 251 BT-14s and 94 AT-6s. The BT-14 (NA-58) was a fixed gear aircraft with a metal skinned fuselage 14 inches longer than the BT-9. In 1941, 27 BT-14s were refitted with the R-985-11, and designated as BT-14A-NAs. In June 1939, NAA received an order for 94 AT-6-NAs (NA-59), powered by the wright R-1340-47 and able to mount two machines guns.

The USAAC AT-6A, and the U.S. Navy SNJ-3, were based on the NA-77 and NA-78 designs. Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-49 Wasp radial engine powered the USAAC aircraft, while R-1340-38s powered the Navy aircraft. The USAAC received 1847 AT-6As, and the Navy received 270 SNJ-3s.

The AT-6B (NA-84) was built for armament training, and could mount a machine gun on the right nose cowl, right wing, and in the rear cockpit, and could carry a light bomb rack. The aircraft was powered by the R-1340-AN-1 engine. The USAAC received 400.

The NA-88 design was used to build 2970 AT-6Cs (747 of which went to the British Commonwealth as Harvard IIas), 2401 SNJ-4s, 2604 AT-6Ds (537 of which went to the British Commonwealth as Harvard IIIs), and 1357 SNJ-5s. The first AT-6C aircraft was delivered on 12 February 1942. The 12-volt electrical system was changed to a 24-volt system in the AT-6D, for standardization amongst the service. The AT-6D, which was also armament capable, and early versions included a wing gun camera, and a high-pressure oxygen system. The AT-6D used two toggle starter switches, rather than the foot pedal starter, and the first AT-6D was delivered on 22 July 1943. The Navy received an additional 630 AT-6Ds direct from the USAAF, redesignating them SNJ-5s, for a total of 1987. Similarly, the NA-121 design was used to build the final wartime Texans, and included 800 AT-6Ds (of which 211 went to the Navy as SNJ-5s), and 956 AT-6Fs (of which 411 went to the Navy as SNJ-6s). They were capable of carrying a centerline drop tank.

From 1942, Canada&#x27;s Noorduyn built 2557 R-1340-AN-1-powered Harvard IIs under license, paid for by USAAF Lend-Lease funds as the AT-16, but designated as the Harvard II.B. After WWII, many remained in service with the RCAF.

The NA-168 series consisted of remanufactured AT-6s and SNJs for the USAF, starting in 1949. The Air Training Command received 641 aircraft, designated T-6G-NT, of which 416 eventually were sent to U.S. Military Assistance Program countries. U.S. National Guard units received an additional 50 aircraft, of which 28 eventually were sent to France. An additional 59 aircraft were Liaison/Trainer aircraft, designated LT-6G-NA, for the Korean War. These aircraft could be deployed with 2 detachable machine gun pods, and 4 HVARs, or 4 bombs, plus a auxiliary drop tank. Alternatively, they could carry the gun pods and 12 SCA markings rockets, or 6 bombs. The T-6G-NAs had a fuel capacity, while previous models had a capacity. The rear cockpit also had the same instruments as the front cockpit. Then, in 1951, the USAF placed an order for 824 T-6Gs, designated T-6G-1-NH, for the Air Training Command.

The Canada Car and Foundry built 285 Harvard 4s, designated NA-186 under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP) and an additional 270 directly for the RCAF.

In April 1951, the USAF ordered an additional 107 T-6Gs for the MDAP, designated NA-188. They placed an order for 11 training aircraft in March 1952, designated NA-195, and then a final batch of 110 aircraft in June for MDAP, designated NA-197.

==Operational history==

The aircraft was mainly used for training, but in many cases it was also repurposed into combat roles. The aircraft served in a great many air forces around the world in the mid to late 20th century. After serving in air forces, it also went on to be displayed at air shows and museums as a warbird.

===Combat use===
The British used Harvards during World War II in North Africa, but not in a combat role. They were used extensively for preparing pilots in theatre for flying US aircraft types, whose handling and controls differed from British aircraft.

No. 74 Operational Training Unit (OTU) was formed at RAF Aqir in Palestine from &#x27;C&#x27; Flight of 71 OTU who made various moves to Rayak in July 1942, Muqeibila in November 1942, and back to Aqir in February 1943. The RAF later handed over control to No. 203 Group RAF in May 1943. The unit disbanded in July 1945. Harvard AJ841 &quot;Wacky Wabbit&quot; saw service with No. 154 Squadron RAF. Originally 154 Squadron were based just at RAF Fowlmere before they were deployed to the Middle East in 1942. Record cards for 154 Squadron show the squadron Harvard being flown by Flying Officer DC Dunn from Minnigh (Syria) to Ramat David (Palestine) on 12 February 1944.
Peru used its seven T-6 fighter bombers in the Ecuadorian-Peruvian War equipped with two guns, while carrying up to four bombs. Twenty AT-6s were employed by the 1st and 2nd fighter squadrons of the Syrian Air Force in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, providing ground support for Syrian troops, and launching airstrikes against Israeli airfields, ships, and columns, losing one aircraft to antiaircraft fire. They also engaged in air-to-air combat on a number of occasions, with a rear gunner shooting down an Israeli Avia S-199 fighter.

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) bought 17 Harvards, and operated nine of them in the final stages of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, against the Egyptian ground forces, with no losses. In the Sinai Campaign, IAF Harvards attacked Egyptian ground forces in Sinai Peninsula with two losses.

The Royal Hellenic Air Force employed three squadrons of British- and American-supplied T-6D and G Texans for close air support, observation, and artillery spotting duties during the Greek Civil War, providing extensive support to the Greek army during the Battle of Gramos. Communist guerillas called these aircraft , because they saw them flying very early in the morning. After the &quot;Milkmen&quot;, the guerillas waited for the armed Spitfires and Helldivers.

During the Korean War and, to a lesser extent, the Vietnam War, T-6s were pressed into service as forward air control aircraft. These aircraft were designated T-6 &quot;Mosquitos&quot;.

No. 1340 Flight RAF used the Harvard in Kenya against the Mau Mau in the 1950s, where they operated with bombs and machine guns against the rebels. Some operations took place at altitudes around above mean sea level. A Harvard was the longest-serving RAF aircraft, with an example, taken on strength in 1945, still serving in the 1990s (as a chase plane for helicopter test flights—a role for which the Shorts Tucano&#x27;s higher stall speed was ill-suited).

The T-6G was also used in a light attack or counterinsurgency role by France during the Algerian War in special (EALA), armed with machine guns, bombs and rockets. At its peak, 38 EALAs were active. The largest unit was the 72, which consisted of up to 21 EALAs.

From 1961 to 1975, Portugal used more than a hundred T-6Gs, also in the counterinsurgency role, during the Portuguese Colonial War. During this war, almost all the Portuguese Air Force bases and air fields in Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea had a detachment of T-6Gs.

On 16 June 1955, rebel Argentine Navy SNJ-4s bombed Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, Argentina; one was shot down by a loyalist Gloster Meteor. Navy SNJ-4s were later used by the &quot;colorado&quot; rebels in the 1963 Argentine Navy Revolt, launching attacks on the 8th Tank Regiment columns on 2 and 3 April, knocking out several M4 Sherman tanks, and losing one SNJ to anti-aircraft fire.

In 1957–58, the Spanish Air Force used T-6s as counterinsurgency aircraft in the Ifni War, armed with machine guns, iron bombs, and rockets, achieving an excellent reputation due to its reliability, safety record, and resistance to damage.

The Pakistan Air Force used T-6Gs in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 as a night ground-support aircraft, hitting soft transport vehicles of the Indian army. In the early hours of 5 December, during a convoy interdiction mission in the same area, Squadron Leader Israr Quresh&#x27;s T-6G Harvard was hit by Indian antiaircraft ground fire and a shell fractured the pilot&#x27;s right arm. Profusely bleeding, the pilot flew the aircraft back with his left hand and landed safely. The World War II-vintage propellered trainers were pressed into service and performed satisfactorily in the assigned role of convoy escorts at night.

The South African Air Force received their first T-6s in October 1942 to be used by the Joint Air Training Scheme. By July 1944, 633 Harvard Mk IIA T-6s and IIIs had been shipped to South Africa with another 555 (379 MkIIAs and 176 Mk IIIs) to arrive by October 1945. Another 65 (AT-6Ds and 30 T-6Gs) were ordered between 1952 and 1956. The aircraft also saw some action during the South African Border war. The T-6 remained in service until 1995 as a basic trainer, mainly as a result of the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies. They were replaced by Pilatus PC-7 MkII turboprop trainers.

===Research testbed===
The Harvard 4 has been used in Canada as a testbed aircraft for evaluating cockpit attitude displays. Its aerobatic capability permits the instructor pilot to maneuver the aircraft into unusual attitudes, then turn the craft over to an evaluator pilot in the &quot;blind&quot; rear cockpit to recover, based on one of several digitally generated attitude displays.

In the September 1944 issue of &quot;The Sportsman Pilot&quot;, USAAF Capt. Paul K. Jones&#x27; article stated, &quot;The &quot;Six&quot; is a plane that can do anything a fighter can do—and even more. Naturally not as fast, she makes up for speed in her ease of handling and her maneuverability. She&#x27;s a war machine, yes, but more than that she&#x27;s a flyer&#x27;s airplane. Rolls, Immelmans, loops, spins, snaps, vertical rolls—she can do anything—and do it beautifully. For actual combat, more guns, more speed and more power is needed. But for the sheer joy of flying—give me an AT-6.&quot;

After World War II, the National Air Races established a unique racing class for the AT-6/Texan/Harvard aircraft; this class continues today at the Reno National Air Races each year.

Since the Second World War, the T-6 has been a regular participant at air shows, and was used in many movies and television programs. For example, converted single-seat T-6s painted in Japanese markings to represent Mitsubishi Zeros made appearances in &quot;A Yank in the R.A.F.&quot; (1941), &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (1976-1978), and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980). In &quot;A Bridge too Far&quot; (1977) it represented the razorback Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Some were modified for the Dutch film &quot;Soldaat van Oranje&quot; (1977) to represent the Dutch pre–World War II fighter Fokker D.XXI.

<text>Grupo Televisa, S.A.B., simply known as Televisa, is a Mexican telecommunications and broadcasting company. A major Latin American mass media corporation, it often presents itself as the largest producer of Spanish-language content.

In April 2021, Televisa announced that they would sell the company&#x27;s media and entertainment assets to Univision Communications, which would form a new company to be known as TelevisaUnivision. The transaction was completed on 31 January 2022, with Televisa owning a 45% stake of the company.

==Company==
===History===
Since its beginning, the company has been owned by the Azcárraga family. The company has been led and owned by three generations of Azcárraga; each has marked an era for the company and, until October 2017, each had passed the ownership of the company to his son upon his death.

====Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta (1955–1972)====
Grupo Televisa was founded in 1955 as Telesistema Mexicano, linking Mexico&#x27;s first three television stations: XHTV-TV (founded in 1950), XEW-TV (1951) and XHGC-TV (1952). Along with Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta, the O&#x27;Farril family and Ernesto Barrientos Reyes, who had signed on Mexico&#x27;s first radio station, XEW-AM, in 1930, were co-owners of the firm. Its headquarters, known as Televicentro, were originally located on Avenida Chapultepec in downtown Mexico City. The building opened on 10 February 1952.
The channel was the first national network to be broadcast in color in 1963. Before the launch, Telesistema began airing in color in the late 1950s in select cities along the U.S.-Mexico border, given the fact that color signals were already present since the start of US color television in the decade starting from 1954.

In 1968, Telesistema&#x27;s main competitor, Televisión Independiente de México (TIM), entered Mexico City with XHTM-TV Canal 8. At the time, both Telesistema and TIM (which was based in Monterrey) competed with another new station, XHDF-TV channel 13, which also started transmissions in 1968. Over the next four years, both networks competed in content and image until they merged, taking on the name &quot;Televisa&quot; in 1973. In the merger deal, the owners of Telesistema had 75 percent of the stocks, while the owners of Televisión Independiente had the rest, which were sold to Telesistema later because of financial problems.

On 7 September 1970, &quot;24 Horas&quot; debuted and became one of Mexico&#x27;s most-watched news programs. The host, journalist Jacobo Zabludovsky, anchored the newscast for almost three decades.

The 1973 merger brought in another new face who would later help revolutionize television and pop music: Raúl Velasco and his Sunday program &quot;Siempre en Domingo&quot;, which was, from the start, being aired on Telesistema. Its successful run of 29 seasons (1969–98) not only featured the best pop artists from Spain and Latin America as well as from English-speaking countries, but also the most successful local singers, and its broadcast into many countries in both North and South America helped promote Latin pop to millions of television viewers.

====Emilio Azcárraga Milmo (1972–1997)====
On 17 August 1972, Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta died, and Emilio Azcárraga Milmo succeeded him as company president and owner. On 8 January 1973, both Telesistema Mexicano and Televisión Independiente de México merged, taking on the name Televisa, an acronym for &quot;Televisión Via Satélite&quot; in Spanish. In 1975, brothers Emilio Diez Barroso and Fernando Diez Barroso began working in the presidency offices of Televisa.

Televisa started to transmit several programs produced by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in 1977. On 3 March 1983, Channel 8 was reformatted to become a cultural channel, offering informative programs, debates and cultural shows. In 1985, a frequency swap moved the station from channel 8 to 9, and Televisa also decided to swap its callsign for that of XEQ-TV, which had been on channel 9 and broadcast from Altzomoni; the XHTM callsign was moved to that station, which was moved to channel 10. Canal 9 eventually became Galavisión, now known as Gala TV.

On 19 September 1985, an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale caused widespread damage in Mexico City and destroyed the south tower of Televisa&#x27;s main building. Nonetheless, Televisa&#x27;s transmissions were not seriously affected. However, several dubbed TV shows were lost.

In 1991, Televisa, with help from Japanese public television network NHK (Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai), began its first broadcast in HDTV, using the Japanese Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling Encoding MUSE system, the first in Latin America. Between 1993 and 1994 Televisa was about to buy Italian local TV station GBR, based in Rome, planning to import in Italy the network&#x27;s mixed sport-&quot;telenovelas&quot; formula, but the transaction was ultimately aborted.

It was Azcárraga Milmo who presided over the launch of company owned Noticias ECO in 1988, which was the first Spanish language cable and satellite news network in Latin America.

====Emilio Azcárraga Jean (1997–2017)====
In April 1997, Milmo died and Emilio Azcárraga Jean succeeded him as the president of the company. Azcárraga Jean was 29 years old and he was one of the youngest executives in Mexico at that time. In December 1997, Televisa joined with other Mexican media companies to create a marathon known as &quot;Teletón&quot;, whose mission is to provide knowledge about physical disabilities, giving a strong message about respect, equality and support to people in these conditions. This movement from media, enterprises and Mexicans is reflected in the buildings created with the money from this Marathon, named Centros de Rehabilitación Infantil (CRIT). It is said that sponsors use it as a way to deduce taxes as the Teletón takes place at the end of the fiscal year and therefore allows companies to deduce their donations before declaring their incomes. Televisa introduced a new logo on 1 January 2001, putting eight lines instead of ten, and it closely resembles the previous logo. Changes include the sun now being a 3D ball, which in turn making the logo an eye, and the wordmark was brought back and in Helvetica Black.

Televisa is the largest mass media company in Latin America, and it is owned by the Azcárraga family. Televisa controls 66% of the 465 television concessions. Also Televisa owns television programing and broadcasting, programing pay television, publishing distribution, cable television, radio production and broadcasting, football teams (Club Necaxa and Club America), stadiums, Televisa editorial (that makes books, newspapers and magazines), paging services, professional sports and business promotion, film production and distribution, dubbing, operation of horizontal internet portal, DVD distribution, EMI Televisa music, Playcity casino, etc.

There is complicity between Mexican media and government. Media and political power in México have a symbiotic relationship where the economic elites that control the media (Televisa and TV Azteca) are privileged in exchange for their support for the policies and actions of the government. In México the mass media owners are likely to have access to high levels of the Mexican government. On 3 May 2006, the community of San Salvador Atenco was violently repressed by the Mexican police who used excessive force and committed severe human rights violations. This event was one of the most violent repressions in the nation&#x27;s history. This event is important because it shows how Televisa and TV Azteca were involved in inciting and supporting the repression of the people of Atenco by the government in México. The approval of the repression of Atenco by TV Azteca and Televisa can be seen as a clear example of the collaboration between mass media and government. Televisa and TV Azteca through their news programs support government policies without criticism and dismiss alternative voices to the dominant discourse. When this event occurred, mass media portrayed the farmers of Atenco as a radical social movement without reporting the reason behind the mobilization. In México the mass media are not there to provide objective information, México is under the shadow of authoritative journalism, in which they are only there to endorse an agenda that is aligned with the government.

In August 2014, Televisa announced it would acquire the remaining shares in Mexican cable firm Cablecom that it did not already own for a fee of around $653.96 million. In September 2014, it was announced that Grupo Salinas would acquire Grupo Televisa&#x27;s 50 percent stake in Mexico&#x27;s third largest wireless operator Iusacell for a fee of $717 million. In January 2016, Televisa introduced a new branding, including a new logo design: an updated version of the company&#x27;s logo from 1973, and a new slogan &quot;Tu companía, tu más&quot;.

====Post-Azcárraga family leadership; sale of content assets to Univision and spin-off of gambling, publishing and sports assets (2017–present)====
Emilio Azcárraga Jean renounced the leadership of Televisa in October 2017, although he remains chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. The newly appointed leader of the company will be the first not to be part of the Azcarraga family. The move was made to combat the massive decline in Televisa&#x27;s viewership created by the rise in popularity of Netflix and other video streaming services, becoming more popular than cable television, as well as the end of the duopoly of private channels caused by the arrival of new players in the 2010s.

On 13 April 2021, Televisa announced that it would sell its content assets to its longtime U.S. partner, Univision Communications which it would combine Televisa&#x27;s four free-to-air television networks in Mexico, specialty channels, its Videocine film studio, and the Televisa trademark; with Univision&#x27;s broadcast networks and specialty channels, radio, and digital assets. The merger was targeted to be completed by the end of that year, subject to U.S. and Mexican regulatory reviews, and the new company would be known as TelevisaUnivision. Televisa would own 45% of the combined company and would retain its shares in Club America football team, telecommunication company Izzi Telecom, satellite TV provider Sky Mexico, and publishing businesses, as well as the broadcast licenses for free-to-air TV stations within Mexico and other infrastructure for the company&#x27;s four TV networks; the national and local TV news operations were spun off into Tritón Comunicaciones.

The sale was approved by Mexico&#x27;s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) on 15 September 2021. The merger was approved by American Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on 24 January 2022, while the sale was completed on 31 January of that same year.

In 2023, Televisa announced plans to spin off its gambling and sports operations as a separate company. The company was named Ollamani and the spin-off was completed on 20 February 2024.

In 2024, Televisa acquired AT&amp;T&#x27;s controlling stake in Sky México, pending regulatory approval. That same year, the company announced that Azcárraga would be taking an &quot;administrative leave&quot; pending the results of a United States Department of Justice investigation regarding the broadcasting rights to FIFA tournaments.

==Criticisms and controversies==
===Political bias, defamation and impartial news coverage===
Due to Televisa&#x27;s multiple and diverse areas of business and political interests around the country, Latin America and the U.S., it has been often accused of airing misleading information about individuals or organizations in which may exist a conflict of interest. Many remember the famous phrase from the former owner of Televisa Emilio Azcarraga Milmo referring to himself as a &quot;soldado del Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI)&quot; (soldier of the Institutional Revolutionary Party), the longtime ruling political party in Mexico that held presidency of Mexico uninterruptedly for 71 years from 1929 to 2000, however, with his death and the arrival of his son Emilio Azcarraga Jean to the head of the network, there was the promise to cut all political ties with the PRI. However, if the relationship ended or not has been widely disputed, along with their impartiality when it comes to their economic interests in diverse business areas.

====Francisco Ibarra and Emilio Maurer====
Long before 1991, Televisa exercised strong control over the Mexican Football Federation (&quot;Federación Mexicana de Fútbol&quot;) in which they participated with the ownership of two teams (Club América and Necaxa). However, that year a rival group, Imevision (now TV Azteca) took control over the federation with Francisco Ibarra as the acting president and Emilio Maurer as Secretary, both of whom started a series of changes concerning mainly to the administration of a poll of money earned in sponsorships of the National Soccer Team; this fight resulted in a prosecution through several TV channels owned by the network resulting in Ibarra and Maurer being expelled from the Federation, even Maurer being incarcerated. Rumors of then President of Mexico Carlos Salinas de Gortari being involved in this prosecution began to circulate, however, this was never confirmed.

====Santiago Creel Miranda====
In 2008, the approval of a series of laws that would enable the Federal Institute of Elections (IFE) to buy in exclusive airtime for political campaigns on TV networks, radio and newspapers for all political parties, that would undermine the economical revenue of Televisa and TV Azteca in marketing political candidates to public election posts, led to the virtual &quot;disappearance&quot; in news shows and other programming of Televisa network (along with TV Azteca) in retaliation to Santiago Creel Miranda and other lawmakers (senadores) of all political parties involved in the approval of these laws.

====Issac Saba Raffoul====
In 2010, Televisa (along with competitor TV Azteca) began airing a series of reports in their news shows in which
they claimed that businessman Isaac Saba Raffoul held a monopoly in the field of pharmaceuticals distribution along with the country with their enterprise Grupo Saba, those affirmations occurred as a consequence of the business partnership between Isaac Saba Raffoul and General Electric to become the third national television network. This partnership, in the potential case of becoming successful in acquiring rights from the Federal Government to transmit along the country, would have diminished the TV market share of Televisa and TV Azteca.

====Grupo Reforma====
In 2011, Televisa began airing a series of reports related to publication of classifieds on newspapers owned by Grupo Reforma (a large holding of businesses that includes newspapers, online news and others) of women offering sex service, often offered as massage service, escort service, etc. implying these could lead to various crimes like human trafficking, sexual slavery, kidnapping of women and others (prostitution laws in Mexico are very ambiguous). Although those classifieds are published in a wide range of newspapers around the country, Televisa specifically targeted Grupo Reforma&#x27;s publications. Analysts say this was a retaliation against Grupo Reforma for their extense coverage of the affair of their star news anchor Carlos Loret de Mola, all of this, however, as a retaliation itself to the fact that Televisa obtained licenses to provide third and fourth generation wireless services in partnership with communications giant Nextel.

====Carlos Slim Helu (Telmex)====
In 2011, Televisa began airing reports concerning an allegedly monopoly of Telmex and America Movil (Telcel) on national cellular phone service and claiming that customers were being overcharged; also claiming that fees to interconnect to existing cellular grid and infrastructure to third parties were excessively high. This fight occurred when both companies were trying to obtain from the Federal Government the rights to offer to customers &quot;Triple Play&quot; which means that one carrier could provide cellular service, television and internet in one complete package. However, this matter resulted on interminable courtroom fights between both parties and the decision has been delayed so far.

====Pablo Salazar Mendiguchia====
In 2011 Televisa began airing an extense coverage on the arrest and incarceration of Chiapas ex-governor Pablo Salazar Mendiguchia, accused of several crimes, this coverage was prolonged and very extensive. In an interview with journalist Carmen Aristegui, famed writer and analyst Rafael Loret de Mola accepted to some degree that perhaps a political prosecution was occurring, but that his main concern was that he had (and showed on air) a legal document in which Adela Micha Zaga (a news anchor with Televisa) gives legal power to then ex-governor Pablo Salazar Mendiguchia (also a lawyer) to act as an inmobiliary agent to sell a condo she possessed a few years ago. His concern was about a &quot;perverse&quot; relation between Salazar and Televisa journalists.

====May 2012 rallies====
On 19 May 2012 a series of rallies &quot;Marchas Anti-Peña&quot; (Rallies Against-Peña) were held across the country (D.F., Guadalajara, Monterrey, Pachuca, Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Jalapa, Colima, and others). In addition to proclaiming dislike of Enrique Peña Nieto (the political candidate of the PRI), the protest was also aimed at the news coverage of Peña Nieto, principally by the program Tercer Grado. The rally organizers claimed that Televisa was actively assisting Peña Nieto to win the forecoming election and that their intense coverage of his activities as the Governor of Estado de Mexico, helped him position as the No. 1 in opinion polls. Rallies also occurred outside of Televisa San Angel (Televisa headquarters), where some of the protesters were permitted to air their points of view on a nationwide telecast.

As of 2011, its closest competitors are TV Azteca (also in Mexico) and TVE (Spain). In 2012, he was embroiled in controversy since the progressive movement, headed by leading left into Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was openly accused of sponsoring the PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto.

====Money laundering====

On 23 August 2012, 18 alleged company employees were arrested in Nicaragua, accused of international drug trafficking, organized crime and money laundering; six vans that bore the logo of the media company also were seized which had professional production equipment for television transmission and registered in the name Televisa SA de CV, where drugs and $9.2 million in cash were transported. According to statements of the television itself, detainees do not belong to Televisa, and the vehicles were registered with false documents to the Ministry of Transport and Roads of the Federal District. Supposedly stationery used in these forgeries (especially some business cards and letterhead) involved Amador Narcia, a reporter who disappeared from Televisa News following this scandal.

====Televisa political bias in favor of Margarita Zavala controversy====
On 21 November 2016 Televisa released a telenovela (soap opera) titled &quot;La candidata&quot; (The candidate [&quot;La&quot; is a feminine noun]) portrayed by actress Silvia Navarro as Regina Bárcenas (whom acts as the speculated fictional stand-in for Margarita Zavala) and Rafael Sánchez Navarro as her husband Alonso San Roman (which acts as the speculated fictional stand-in for Felipe Calderón). It is heavily speculated this television program, was created in order to favor Zavala in the 2018 elections against MORENA&#x27;s political candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador whom Televisa supposedly didn&#x27;t want as president due to his left-leaning political viewpoints.

====Alleged under-coverage of Jaime &quot;El Bronco&quot; Rodriguez Calderon====
Previous to the release of the telenovela, during the same year Televisa found in itself on another political bias controversy showing bias against Nuevo León&#x27;s governor Jaime &quot;El Bronco&quot; Rodríguez Calderón who is a potential 2018 presidential candidate It happened on 11 September 2016, during a Live-Television News broadcast from &quot;Monterrey al Dia&quot; where Televisa news reporter, Karla Minaya, mistakenly said: &quot;&quot; (&quot;we have to try that the governor, for sure, is mentioned the least possible&quot;) which was perceived to show clear signs of political bias from the network. The Mexican newspaper &quot;El Universal&quot; published on social media a video of the event, which was covered by national news media although Televisa did not cover the story and declined to comment. El Bronco&#x27;s predecessor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz had spent 4000 millions of pesos on payments to television news media (Televisa included), supposedly to clean his image. Sick of what he considered to be the corruption in the Mexican media, El Bronco had previously vowed to not spend a single peso on purchasing favorable media coverage. So supposedly in retaliation, the Mexican Televisa news mentioned him the least possible, or with biased news coverage of unfair criticisms and defamation. In El Bronco&#x27;s own words: (There are 314 denouncements of stolen cars, we retrieved 229, but since we didn&#x27;t pay Televisa, Multimedios and TV Azteca they don&#x27;t show it. We have disbanded a band of thieves of cars and trucks. We have said it on every press round, but Televisa, Multimedios and TV Azteca don&#x27;t show it.)

===2017 Puebla earthquake fake news controversy===
On 19 September 2017, an 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico City, collapsing 40 buildings. During the news coverage of the devastation, Televisa reported there was a 12-year-old girl named Frida Sofia trapped within the debris of the Enrique C. Rébsamen school. The Mexican Navy initially corroborated the story, but on September 21, officials claimed that they were &quot;sure that the existence of the minor was not a reality.&quot; Televisa was heavily criticized for sharing fake news and making rescue teams waste time saving a non-existing girl, distracting them from saving real people trapped in the debris.

Later that day, rival network TV Azteca decided to air S3E13 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Radio Bart&quot;, whose plot consisted of Bart Simpson fooling the people on Springfield into thinking a little kid named Timmy O&#x27;Toole was trapped in a hole, mirroring the way Televisa fooled Mexico about Frida Sofia. Timmy O&#x27;Toole soon became the topic of internet memes.

===Denigratory treatment towards women===
In the Netflix documentary &quot;Cuando conocí al Chapo: La historia de Kate del Castillo&quot; focused on the story of how actress Kate del Castillo met Mexican drug dealer Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán. The aforementioned former Televisa actress, along producer Epigmenio Ibarra, both stated that during the 90&#x27;s Televisa treated actresses as sex objects, going as far as offering them to investors and publicists.

==Partnerships with other television networks==
===Televisa and Univision===
Televisa has an ongoing relation with the US-based Univision network, dating back to the 1960s, when Univision&#x27;s predecessor, the Spanish International Network (SIN), was owned by Telesistema Mexicano, Televisa&#x27;s predecessor.

In October 2010, Televisa agreed to take a 5% stake in Univision and to extend and expand the companies&#x27; long-term program license agreement. The new program license agreement will include Internet and mobile rights and cover key Mexican football (soccer) rights and will run through at least 2020.

===Televisa and Telemundo===
On 18 March 2008, Televisa and NBCUniversal announced a 10-year multiplatform agreement that would allow 1,000 hours of Telemundo programming from news, entertainment programs, specials, and sports to be broadcast over not only its Galavision channel (XEQ-TV), but also its SKY Channel and Cablevision cable system starting in April, as well as a planned Telemundo pay TV channel to be launched later in 2008.

===Televisa&#x27;s uncompleted agreement to acquire a stake in Nextel Mexico===
In January 2010, Televisa announced an offer to acquire a 30% stake in Nextel Mexico from NII Holdings for US$1.44 billion. However, they later terminated the agreement.

==In popular culture==
===Film depiction===
The perceived political favoritism of Televisa towards the PRI, and the concept of the &quot;cortinas de humo (smoke screens)&quot; was explored in the Mexican black-comedy film &quot;The Perfect Dictatorship&quot; (2014), directed and written by Luis Estrada, whose plot directly criticizes both the PRI and Televisa. Taking place in a Mexico with a tightly controlled media landscape, the plot centers around a corrupt politician (a fictional stand-in for Enrique Peña Nieto) from a political party (serving as a fictional stand-in for the PRI), and how he makes a deal with TV MX (which serves as a stand-in to Televisa) to manipulate the diffusion of news towards his benefit, in order to save his political career. The director made it based on the perceived media manipulation in Mexico.

<doc id="763007" wikidata="Q2040397" url="?curid=763007" title="Mono (UK band)">
<text>Mono was a British electronic music duo which had a hit in the late 1990s with their song &quot;Life in Mono&quot;. The group&#x27;s music is often described as trip hop, based on its similarities to contemporary electronic music acts including Sneaker Pimps and Portishead. Audible, and frequently cited, influences in Mono&#x27;s songs include jazzy instrumentation reminiscent of 1960s spy film soundtracks and production styles rooted in 1960s pop music.

==Biography==
===History===
The band, formed in late 1996 in London, consisted of singer Siobhan de Maré and Martin Virgo on keyboards, synthesizer programming, and production. Virgo, trained in classical piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had been working as a session musician since the early 1990s as part of the production team of Nellee Hooper, which led to credits on a remix of Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; (considered one of the landmark songs of trip hop&#x27;s &quot;Bristol sound&quot;) and Björk&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Debut&quot;. De Maré comes from a family with several generations of history in entertainment; her father was Tony Meehan, drummer for the Shadows, her grandfather was one of the Gongmen featured in the opening logo sequences in Rank Organisation films, and her grandmother was a dancer who worked with Shirley Bassey. She had been working as a session singer for hip hop and R&amp;B musicians, as well as writing and touring, though much of this material consisted of underground and white label releases.

The two were introduced to each other while in London in pursuit of their respective musical projects: Virgo was in the midst of a break in session work, while de Maré had been planning to set up a personal recording studio in Paris. Despite different musical influences (de Maré by R&amp;B and soul, Virgo by 1960s pop standards, and classical music from sources such as France and the Second Viennese School), their collaborative songwriting efforts apparently meshed easily. Virgo describes the demos recorded at this time as comprising ideas such as &quot;Parliament breaks under bits of Serge Gainsbourg&quot;. After some demo tapes were distributed among music industry executives, the band received a number of contract offers from record labels. The pressure of this drove them to form a group, even with de Maré having gone on vacation in Los Angeles at this point. Originally planning to use the name &quot;Tremelux&quot;, they chose instead &quot;Mono&quot;, derived from the title of the Phil Spector release &quot;Back to Mono&quot;.

The band signed a UK-only contract at first with Echo Records, passing up labels like Warner, Island, and London. Their first release, in 1996, was an EP of the song &quot;Life in Mono&quot; and various remixes, most notable of these being two by the Propellerheads, a popular big beat band and remix group at the time. This was followed by the &quot;Formica Blues&quot; album in 1997.

In 1998, the use of &quot;Life in Mono&quot; in the soundtrack, trailers, and end credits of the film adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (after Robert De Niro, who was working on the film, heard the song) brought greater exposure for the song than ever before, and it became the number one most requested song on US radio stations (such as KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, KITS in San Francisco, and WNNX in Atlanta) for weeks following the film&#x27;s release. (In terms of specific radio stations, for example, &quot;Life in Mono&quot; made #45 on the KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1998 and #76 on the 91X Top 91 of 1998, while &quot;Formica Blues&quot; was #73 on Toronto&#x27;s 102.1 The Edge&#x27;s 1998 year-end top 102 albums countdown.) With the band&#x27;s new U.S. deal with Mercury Records (signed with then-A&amp;R vice president Steve Greenberg, who had reportedly been looking to sign the band from the start), promotional singles of &quot;Life in Mono&quot; were also distributed to nightclubs at about the same time as modern rock stations, though only later was the single provided to Top 40 stations.

Now at the height of their popularity, Mono embarked on their only concert tour. After a quiet period, however, the band broke up in 2000. De Maré now sings for Violet Indiana featuring Robin Guthrie of the group Cocteau Twins; later, in 2004, she recalled feeling &quot;creatively stifled&quot; as part of Mono. Violet Indiana has released a number of singles, two albums and a singles collection. More recently, de Maré also founded Pearl Dust, a music management company. Virgo joined International Love Corporation, an unsigned rock band promoted through Myspace and CD Baby, as keyboardist.

===Musical style===
Virgo has stated that his top musical influences are John Barry, Burt Bacharach and Phil Spector. These influences are evident in the songs on &quot;Formica Blues&quot;, which Virgo has characterized as being inspired by the most-played music in his record collection. For example, &quot;Life in Mono&quot; samples harpsichords from Barry&#x27;s soundtrack to &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, and &quot;High Life&quot; pays homage to the sound of the girl groups Spector produced in the 1960s.

The music of early 20th-century classical music composers has also been identified as samples in the song &quot;Hello Cleveland!&quot;; in particular, the presence of pieces by Anton Webern, Arnold Schoenberg, and Alban Berg, the principal members of the Second Viennese School, supports Virgo&#x27;s citation of the group (as well as their Klangfarbenmelodie technique) as among his influences. The opening chords of &quot;Hello Cleveland!&quot; are a sample of the opening chords of Keith Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;17 October 1988&quot; from his Paris Concert CD.

==Discography==
Mono&#x27;s entire discography consists of the &quot;Formica Blues&quot; album, two releases of the &quot;Life in Mono&quot; single, further UK singles &quot;Silicone&quot;, &quot;Slimcea Girl&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot;, and the song &quot;Madhouse&quot;, released only on the soundtrack to the 1998 film version of &quot;Psycho&quot;.

A score of remixers were commissioned on their four single releases; aside from the Propellerheads, the more notable of these include Stuart Price (in an early appearance as Les Rythmes Digitales), Mr. Scruff, Matthew Herbert, Jóhann Jóhannsson (under the alias Lhooq), and 187 Lockdown.

==Tour==
In 1997, Mono played a few shows across the United Kingdom and France.

* 11 September: Bargo, Glasgow

&quot;The Independent&quot;, in a review of the Cafe Blue show (attributing it as the group&#x27;s &quot;debut gig&quot;) questioned the choice of location but gave a positive response.

In 1998, the band embarked on its only tour, twenty-one dates divided between North America and Europe while skipping the UK altogether. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, the band were to return to the United States to join the lineup of the 1998 Lilith Fair. They were scheduled to play the following seven dates (reportedly cancelled):

* 28 June: Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion, Phoenix
* 29 June: New Mexico Festival, Albuquerque
* 1 July: All Sports Stadium, Oklahoma City
* 2 July: Sandstone Amphitheater, Bonner Springs
* 4 July: Deer Creek Music Center, Noblesville
* 5 July: Polaris Amphitheater, Columbus
* 6 July: Pine Knob Music Theater, Detroit

==Reception==
Mono&#x27;s success was largely centered in the United States, countered by their relative obscurity in the United Kingdom. When interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; just prior to their first U.S. concert, the band remarked on the lack of a promotional campaign in the UK, and the relative longevity of charting records in the U.S. in comparison; still, &quot;Life in Mono&quot; failed to chart highly on either country&#x27;s national singles chart, reaching #70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #60 on the UK singles chart on its second release.

Two other singles peaked outside the top 100 in the UK. &quot;Slimcea Girl&quot; peaked at #145 in October 1997, and &quot;High Life&quot; peaked at #101 in July 1998 (#91 on the compressed chart with exclusions below #75). The &quot;Formica Blues&quot; album peaked at #71 in the UK in August 1998.

In Australia, &quot;Silicone&quot; peaked at #222 in 1997, and &quot;Life in Mono&quot; peaked at #83 in 1998 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The &quot;Formica Blues&quot; album peaked at #149 in Australia.

===Comparisons===
In making comparisons to other popular artists of the late 1990s, Al Muzer, in &quot;Consumable Online&quot;, commends the band&#x27;s music for being more sophisticated than chart-topping acts such as the Spice Girls and Hanson; other reviewers, such as &quot;Spin&quot;″s Jeff Salamon, take a more critical stance in noting the preponderance of bands with similar influences—period film scores and orchestrated pop, overlaid with beats—in the wake of Portishead, and criticize Mono for playing &quot;by-the-numbers&quot; in a combined review with Alpha&#x27;s &quot;ComeFromHeaven&quot;, which is rated above &quot;Formica Blues&quot; for its more varied musical approaches. Several other critics make a note of Mono&#x27;s relationship to this body of artists—characterized by AllMusic as &quot;mid-&#x27;90s male instrumentalist/female singer duos&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;that very Nineties pairing of the shady back-room knob-twiddler and the photogenic chanteuse&quot;.

Still others felt that Mono stood out from this group (suggested as a &quot;case of bad timing&quot; by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, which nevertheless published a very favourable review of &quot;Formica Blues&quot;): those with this opinion, such as &quot;Chaos Digizine&quot;, tended to compare the band more to Saint Etienne, to illustrate their successful &quot;weaving together musical elements of the past and present&quot;. In turn, a certain selection of pop singers and composers from the 1960s were frequently associated with Mono as well. The London music newspaper &quot;Echoes&quot; summarizes: &quot;John Barry, Juliette Gréco, Françoise Hardy... Astrud Gilberto... Jerry Goldsmith, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, Avengers, Simone, Albert...&quot;, concluding with references to period television, fashion, and the leading figures of existentialism.

In this, the band found approval with critics who appreciated their faithfulness to the music of the era: Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; said that &quot;unlike many of their contemporaries, they have a reverence for properly constructed songs&quot;, and similarly, Charles Taylor, in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, remarked that &quot;What distinguishes the album from a shopping list of mid-&#x27;60s cool is the enormous affection de Maré and Virgo conjure up for the period they invoke. It&#x27;s the lack of irony or distance in that affection that are the key to understanding this band.&quot;

<doc id="763013" wikidata="Q13979" url="?curid=763013" title="Saturday Night Live">
<text>Saturday Night Live (SNL) is an American late-night live sketch comedy variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Michaels and Dick Ebersol that airs on NBC. The show&#x27;s premiere was hosted by George Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night. The show&#x27;s comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary American culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that is usually based on current events and ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;!&quot;, properly beginning the show.

In 1980, Michaels left the show to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was then replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned. Since then, Michaels has held the job of showrunner. Many &quot;SNL&quot; cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film.

Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC&#x27;s headquarters in the Comcast Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, &quot;SNL&quot; has aired episodes since its debut and began its 50th season on September 28, 2024, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films, including &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980) and &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of &quot;best of&quot; and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.

Throughout five decades on air, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has received a vast number of awards, including 84 Primetime Emmy Awards, 6 Writers Guild of America Awards, and 3 Peabody Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot; list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;TIME.&quot;&quot; As of 2022, the show had received more than 305 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most received by any television program. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers and guests.

== History ==
=== Development: 1974–1975 ===
Beginning in 1965, NBC network affiliates broadcast reruns of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on Saturday or Sunday nights. In 1974, Johnny Carson petitioned to NBC executives for the weekend shows to be pulled and saved so they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off. In response, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached the vice president of late-night programming, Dick Ebersol, and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter&#x27;s idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances that would attract 18- to 34-year-old viewers. NBC decided to base the new show at their studios in 30 Rockefeller Center. Michaels was given Studio 8H, a converted radio studio that was home to NBC&#x27;s election and Apollo moon landing coverage. It was revamped for the premiere at a cost of $250,000.

By 1975, Michaels had assembled the show&#x27;s initial cast, including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, Gilda Radner, and George Coe. The cast was nicknamed the &quot;Not Ready for Prime-Time Players&quot;, a term coined by show writer Herb Sargent. Much of the talent pool involved in the inaugural season was recruited from &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;, including the original head writer, Michael O&#x27;Donoghue.

=== 1970s ===
&quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; debuted on October 11, 1975, with an episode featuring Carlin as host. The original title was used because the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; title was in use by &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot; on rival network ABC. After the cancellation of Cosell&#x27;s show in 1976, NBC purchased the rights to the name and officially changed the show&#x27;s title to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the start of the 1977–1978 season, its third. The cast was initially paid $750 per episode, and essentially lived at the offices, according to Michaels. The show found its footing by the fourth episode, hosted by Candice Bergen, which featured the cast in most segments. The show developed a cult following, and its humor was seen as refreshing and daring, in comparison to previous sketch and variety shows that would rarely deal with controversial topics and issues. Iconic characters during the show&#x27;s first five seasons included Belushi&#x27;s samurai, the Coneheads (Aykroyd, Curtin, Newman), and Radner&#x27;s Roseanne Roseannadanna. Chase, the show&#x27;s first breakout star, left in the middle of its second season to pursue a movie career — the first of many cast members to do so — and was replaced by Bill Murray.

Drugs were a major problem during the show&#x27;s first five years, which exacerbated existing tensions. Cocaine had become an &quot;integral part of the working process&quot; on &quot;SNL&quot; by the 1978–1979 season, according to Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show after the 1978–1979 season to make &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, and as the fifth season ended in 1980, Michaels asked executives to place the show on hiatus for a year in order to allow him time to pursue other projects. Michaels suggested writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey as his replacements; NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken and was infuriated by his Update routine in May 1980, called &quot;A Limo for a Lame-O&quot;, that had critiqued Silverman&#x27;s job performance. Unable to secure the deal that he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC, and Jean Doumanian was given his position. Almost every writer and cast member, including Michaels, left the show after the May 24, 1980, season finale.

=== 1980s ===
Doumanian&#x27;s rapidly-assembled new cast faced immediate comparisons to the previous cast, and was not received favorably by critics or audiences. In a February 1981 episode, cast member Charles Rocket used the profanity &quot;fuck&quot; during a sketch. Rocket later said he was trying to kill time before the show&#x27;s close and had not meant to utter the word. Following this episode, Doumanian was dismissed after only ten months on the job.

Although some executives suggested &quot;SNL&quot; be cancelled, the show received a reprieve, and Dick Ebersol was hired as producer. He worked quickly to revamp the show, eventually removing all of the new cast members aside from Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Ebersol&#x27;s sketches leaned towards more accessible, broad comedy, which alienated some long-time fans, writers, and cast members. His distaste for political humor led the show to largely avoid jokes about President Ronald Reagan during his time as showrunner. Under Ebersol&#x27;s leadership, Murphy, who had been underused during Doumanian&#x27;s tenure, rose to prominence with popular characters such as Mister Robinson&#x27;s Neighborhood and Gumby. His success was a major factor in the show&#x27;s resurgence, though it created tensions within the cast.

In a break with tradition, producers hired established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short for the 1984–1985 season. Though this season was considered one of the series&#x27; funniest, it diverged significantly from Michaels&#x27; innovative approach. Like Michaels before him, Ebersol informed NBC that he would only return if the show took a hiatus to recast and rebuild, and diverge significantly from the established live format. NBC rejected these requests and instead decided to approach Michaels to return as producer.

Michaels returned for the 1985–1986 season; the show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol&#x27;s idea to seek out established actors. Writers struggled with the cast, and Michaels cleaned house again for the 1986–1987 season, seeking unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names. This new cast was successful at reviving the show&#x27;s popularity in the eyes of critics and audiences.

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s, much of this core cast began to leave the show, and younger performers such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler began to be promoted to repertory status. Some of these cast members, such as Sandler, Farley, Rob Schneider, Spade, and Chris Rock, would come to be known as the &quot;Bad Boys of &quot;SNL&quot;&quot; for their outrageous comedy style. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent. This led to increased competition for the show&#x27;s limited screen time, and an increasing reliance on &quot;younger&quot;, less subtle humor.

The show lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase &quot;SNL&quot;″s ratings and profitability, NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. Criticism of the show&#x27;s writing increased during this period, which reached its peak by the 1994–1995 season, which is considered one of the series&#x27; worst. A widely publicized profile of the show in &quot;New York&quot; during this period was highly critical of the show&#x27;s humor, cast, and backstage dysfunction.

The show&#x27;s cast was largely overhauled for the 1995–1996 season with names such as Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri, which was successful at revitalizing the show. The show faced new competition during this period in the form of Fox″s sketch comedy show &quot;Mad TV&quot;, which aired a half hour earlier than &quot;SNL&quot; and featured a more diverse cast.

=== 2000s ===
The 2000–2001 season was notable for its well-received spoofing of that year&#x27;s presidential campaign between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The show&#x27;s New York City cast and crew were highly affected by the September 11 attacks in 2001, and returned on September 29 with an acclaimed appearance by Rudy Giuliani. Political humor was reduced for the following seasons.

The show switched to high-definition broadcasting for the 2005–2006 season. Before the start of the 2006–2007 season, the show suffered budget cuts that led to a smaller cast. The following season was also cut short by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which led to several cancelled episodes.

Tina Fey, who was a cast member and head writer from 1997 to 2006, later returned to the show during the 2008 presidential election for several critically acclaimed guest appearances as vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Writer Robert Smigel later said it was the show&#x27;s &quot;biggest moment since the 70s&quot;, and Michaels observed that it made Fey a &quot;huge star&quot; and that &quot;you could see perception changing completely&quot;. Armisen played Barack Obama from 2008 to 2012, following which cast member Jay Pharoah assumed the impression.

The show began to rely more on pre-recorded material and videos more than it ever had before during this period, to the extent that some commentators said it had sometimes outshined live material on the show. Taped material significantly increased in the mid-2000s with &quot;SNL&quot; Digital Shorts by The Lonely Island, and continued into the following years with videos by Good Neighbor and Please Don&#x27;t Destroy.

=== 2010s ===
The cast continued to evolve significantly into the 2010s as several longtime cast members such as Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig left the series. The 2013–2014 season saw the hiring of seven new cast members in a significant overhaul, including Beck Bennett, Kyle Mooney, and Sasheer Zamata. Longtime head writer and cast member Seth Meyers also exited midway through that season, and was replaced by fellow writer Colin Jost in the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment.

The show frequently parodied Donald Trump in and around his first presidency; an ongoing impression by actor Alec Baldwin led to a significant increase in ratings and a &quot;shot of relevance&quot; for the show, according to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Trump disliked Baldwin&#x27;s impression, tweeting in 2019 that the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should look into stopping &quot;SNL&quot; from &quot;knocking the same person (me), over &amp; over, without so much of a mention of &#x27;the other side.&#x27;&quot; In 2021, sources close to the Trump White House told &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that in 2019, Trump repeatedly asked his advisers and lawyers to stop negative portrayals of him on &quot;SNL&quot; and other shows, such as &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, through the interference of the FCC or the Department of Justice. In 2021, James Austin Johnson assumed the Trump impression from Baldwin.

=== 2020s ===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;SNL&quot;″s 2019–2020 season was indefinitely halted on March 16, 2020. The season was later resumed in April with three remotely produced episodes labelled &quot;Saturday Night Live at Home&quot;, and the show returned to Studio 8H in October 2020. After the 2021–2022 season, many longtime cast members left the show in a major cast overhaul, including Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon, and Pete Davidson; Michaels said that the pandemic had led to some cast members staying with the show for longer than they may have otherwise.

In January 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;speculation [had] been rampant for years&quot; that Michaels would retire from the series after its fiftieth season, premiering in 2024. Michaels told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that month that former head writer and cast member Tina Fey could &quot;easily&quot; be his successor, were he to step down, but said he had not made a decision yet at that point. Michaels has worked with Fey several times since her &quot;SNL&quot; tenure ended, including on &quot;30 Rock&quot;. Michaels earlier said in 2021 that the show&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary would be &quot;a really good time to leave&quot;. Kenan Thompson, the show&#x27;s longest-serving cast member, speculated in 2022 that &quot;SNL&quot; may come to an end altogether after its fiftieth season, saying that it could make financial sense for NBC. However, in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in September 2024, Michaels denied that he was retiring at the end of the season.

A three-hour prime-time live broadcast to celebrate the series&#x27; fiftieth anniversary was aired on February 16, 2025. The writers included prior cast members Tina Fey, Jim Downey, Paula Pell, Seth Meyers, and John Mulaney. The show started with the SNL Monologue by Steve Martin and musical opening by Sabrina Carpenter and Paul Simon.

==Cast and crew==
===Cast===
Those selected to join the cast of &quot;SNL&quot; are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Newman, Hartman, Will Ferrell, Jon Lovitz, Kristen Wiig) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Tina Fey, Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Macdonald, Chris Rock), who already possess the training or experience necessary for &quot;SNL&quot;. The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable. Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, a segment featuring one or two hosts, who get substantial screen time performing as themselves. Many of the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show, including Dennis Miller, Seth Meyers, Norm Macdonald, Colin Quinn, and Jimmy Fallon.
As of Season 50, &quot;SNL&quot; has featured 167 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, Rachel Dratch, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Will Forte, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Chris Parnell, Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Molly Shannon, and many others. Kenan Thompson is the show&#x27;s longest-serving cast member. Currently, the cast consists of 17 members, with 14 repertory players and 3 featured players:

===Contracts and salaries===

The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show, but starting with the 1999–2000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years. The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years—six on &quot;SNL&quot; and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast members, such as Mike Myers and Adam Sandler, gained fame on &quot;SNL&quot; only to leave and make money for other studios. In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to &quot;SNL&quot; for a total of seven years. The contracts also contain a network option that allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time. In the first season of the show the cast was paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four. By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000 and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch that made it to air. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest-paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode).

===Writers===
As of the 2022–23 season, Kent Sublette, Alison Gates, and Streeter Seidell are the show&#x27;s co-head writers.

Seth Meyers became a co-head writer in the 2005-06 season, became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012, and then left in 2014. Current &quot;Update&quot; anchor Colin Jost has himself been a writer since 2005 and was one of the head writers from 2012 to 2015 before being renamed head writer, from 2017 until 2022. Current Update co-anchor Michael Che has been a writer since 2013. He temporarily left the show in the summer of 2014, but came back that fall to anchor Update and reclaimed his status as a writer, then serving as a co-head writer alongside Jost for five years. The Weekend Update segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer Pete Schultz (who has been writing for the segment since 2011; and has been the segment&#x27;s head writer since 2014)

The segment&#x27;s previous head writer was Alex Baze (who wrote for the segment from 2004 to 2014, and was the head writer of the segment starting with the 2011–12 season, until his aforementioned 2014 departure). Scenes on Weekend Update that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside the dedicated Weekend Update team, who know those characters better.

&quot;SNL&quot; writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and ImprovOlympic. Comedian Jim Downey was head writer for 10 years, from 1985 to 1995. Downey (who previously joined the show&#x27;s writing staff in the show&#x27;s second season in 1977) is not only the show&#x27;s longest-tenured head writer, but he is also overall the show&#x27;s longest-tenured writer in the show&#x27;s history. As he wrote for the show on-and-off for 30 years, formally retiring from the show in 2013.

Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the &quot;SNL&quot; writing room. Like the &quot;SNL&quot; cast who appear on camera, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show, such as Conan O&#x27;Brien, who was brought into &quot;SNL&quot; from The Groundlings in 1988, went on to write for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and eventually began hosting his own show. Former head writer Adam McKay, along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die. In 1999, Tina Fey (a year before joining the cast and becoming a Weekend Update anchor) became the first woman &quot;SNL&quot; head writer and successfully made the transition to starring on the show, as well as writing and starring in feature films, ultimately creating and starring in her own show &quot;30 Rock&quot;, which was partly based on her &quot;SNL&quot; experiences. In 2005 Fey was paid $1.5million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer. Writer John Mulaney has also found success outside of &quot;SNL&quot; through well-received stand-up specials, his Broadway act &quot;The Oh, Hello Show&quot;, and the special &quot;John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch&quot;.

===Announcers===
Don Pardo served as the announcer for the series when it began and continued in the role for all but season seven, between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan filled the announcing role. In 2004 Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 when he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 2009–10 season.

In 2010 the 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live, until 2010 when he began recording permanently from Arizona. Former cast members Joe Piscopo and Darrell Hammond have also impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties during times Pardo was unavailable. Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with season 40.

===Hosts and musical guests===
A typical episode of &quot;SNL&quot; will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show. The host delivers the opening monologue and goodnights, introduces the musical guest, and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally, the host of the show ends the opening monologue by mentioning the musical guest for the night and saying, &quot;We got a great show for you tonight, (musical guest) is/are here. So stick around, we&#x27;ll be right back.&quot; Comedian George Carlin was the first to host &quot;SNL&quot; in the debut October 1975 episode; three episodes later, Candice Bergen became the first woman to host and subsequently the first host to return. Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five-Timers Club, a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks&#x27;s fifth episode. As of February 11, 2017, actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who has hosted fifteen times since 1976. Occasionally, former SNL cast members also host.

Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo act, or a band, who performs two or three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest simultaneously serves as the host, and may also appear in comedy sketches. As of October 11, 2020, Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest, performing on fourteen shows since 1992.

Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip-synching tracks, believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are made only when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, in acknowledgment of the difficulty in being both heavily physically active and singing. A 1975 performance by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip-synching, until the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson.

The December 18, 2021, episode (hosted by Paul Rudd) became the first episode to not feature any musical performances since the first episode of season 12, as well as the third episode in the show&#x27;s duration to not have a musical guest, due to the rise of the Omicron variant in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Charli XCX was planned as the musical guest, but her performance was cancelled due to the new restrictions as the show had a &quot;limited cast and crew&quot; and no audience.

===The Band===
The Saturday Night Live Band (also known as &quot;The Live Band&quot;) is the house band for &quot;SNL&quot;. Academy Award-winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a U.S. Coast Guard chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer (1975–1980), Lou Marini (1975–1983), David Sanborn (1975), Michael Brecker (the early 1980s), Ray Chew (1980–1983), Alan Rubin (1975–1983), Georg Wadenius (1979–1985), Steve Ferrone (1985), David Johansen (performing as Buster Poindexter), Tom Malone (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and G. E. Smith (musical director from 1985 to 1995). As of 2017, the band is under the leadership of Tower of Power alumnus Lenny Pickett, keyboardist Leon Pendarvis, and Eli Brueggemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; bumper graphic until the program resumes. The band plays &quot;Closing Theme (Waltz in A)&quot;, written by Shore, at the end of the show.

==Production==

===The studio===
Since the show&#x27;s inception, &quot;SNL&quot; has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors eight and nine of the Comcast Building (formerly the RCA Building and GE Building, now 30 Rockefeller Plaza or &quot;30Rock&quot;). Three of the shows of the 1976–77 season were shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn, due to NBC News using Studio 8H for presidential election coverage.

During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first-season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in high-definition television, appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens. The offices of &quot;SNL&quot; writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of &quot;30Rock&quot;.

===Creating an episode===
Production on an &quot;SNL&quot; episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting between the cast, writers, producers, including Michaels and the guest host in Michaels&#x27;s office over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketchwriting may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts, a process that usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8:00p.m. on Tuesday. At 5:00p.m. on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers&#x27; room, attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in attendance of approximately fifty people. At this point, there may be at least forty sketch ideas that are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.

After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels&#x27; office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels&#x27;s office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived. Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day, but will certainly commence on Thursday. Work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches and possibly rehearsals. If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8:00p.m., again on Saturday, before the live show. After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed. This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast. The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.

According to an interview with Tina Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated Weekend Update writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of Weekend Update will normally not work with or read the scripts from the team until Thursday evening after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.

===Post-production===
With onsite facilities housed on floors eight and seventeen of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring, and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganize for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily analog to digital in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and five cameras&#x27; worth of visual elements. Elements of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that are pre-recorded, such as certain commercial parodies, SNL Digital Shorts, and show graphics are processed off-site in the post-production facilities of Broadway Video.

===Filming and photography===
Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. As of 2018, the show uses five Sony HDC-1500 cameras, primarily mounted on Vinten pedestals, although one is mounted on a Chapman-Leonard Electra crane.

As of 2014, a Grass Valley GVG 4000-3 digital component production switcher and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analog video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analog mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work. While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013–14) had a budget of over $70million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of $12.3million.

Edie Baskin was the original &quot;SNL&quot; photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of Las Vegas and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night. The first episode used publicity photos of host George Carlin as transitional bumpers between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host Paul Simon. It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition that continues today. For the first five seasons, Baskin&#x27;s bumper photos had a hand drawn feel to them, with her drawing directly on the photos with neon or pastel colors over that week&#x27;s host and/or on the background.

Since 1999, Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of &quot;SNL&quot;, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host&#x27;s involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on-site at 30Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday. Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: &quot;I think it just helps the image pop off the screen... If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional... The [classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can.&quot; Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind-the-scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.

==Broadcast==

The show begins at 11:29:30 p.m. Eastern Time, and is scheduled for a 93-minute timeslot ending at 1:02 a.m.

For most of &quot;SNL&quot; history, it aired live only to NBC stations in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, with all others receiving a recorded broadcast at the normal start time of late-night network programming (11:30p.m. Pacific and 10:30p.m. in other time zones). Since 2017, the show is broadcast live across the contiguous United States. Because the show airs outside of the safe harbor outside of Eastern and Central Time, a brief broadcast delay is installed to meet Federal Communications Commission regulations of primetime programming.

Outside of the contiguous United States, the show also airs live on the three NBC stations in Alaska at 7:30 p.m. local. Two NBC stations still broadcast &quot;SNL&quot; on tape delay: KHNL in Honolulu delays it one hour (two hours during Eastern daylight-saving time) to 7:30 p.m. local, and KUAM-TV in Guam, where the live broadcast occurs at 1:30p.m. on Sunday, delays it to 11:00p.m. that night.

Since the first opening in 1975 with Michael O&#x27;Donoghue, Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a cold open sketch which ends with one or more cast members breaking character and proclaiming &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s Saturday Night!&quot;, followed by the opening credits.

In February 2013, NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on select Saturday evenings at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time during the regular season (these may be preempted due to the live airing happening in primetime on the West Coast); the episodes scheduled were sometimes rebroadcasts of the previous week&#x27;s episode if it was a first-run broadcast. Beginning with the 2014–15 season, the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the prime time rebroadcasts were a selection of episodes from throughout the show&#x27;s run under the title &quot;SNL Vintage&quot;. The network dropped the vintage titling and changed to very recent rebroadcasts beginning in the 2023–2024 season.

NBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies either with NBC or Universal Television. From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, Comedy Central and its predecessor Ha! aired reruns of the series, after which E! signed a deal to carry reruns. Abbreviated thirty- and sixty-minute versions of the first five seasons aired as &quot;The Best of Saturday Night Live&quot; in syndication (from Orion Television; at the time, the FCC&#x27;s fin-syn rules prevented NBC from directly distributing reruns of the show) beginning in the 1980s, and later on Nick at Nite in 1988. In September 2010, reruns of most episodes made from 1998 onward began airing on VH1. Starting in February 2016, VH1 and Comedy Central&#x27;s sister channel Logo began airing reruns of 2006-onward episodes on Sunday nights, launching its broadcast as counterprogramming for Super Bowl 50 and branding it the &quot;Live From New York, It&#x27;s Satur-Gay Night!&quot; marathon. Though the show would slowly phase out the cable syndication in favor of streaming through their namesake online app, select seasons on Netflix until the mid-2010s, then the NBC-associated streaming services Seeso and Hulu at various points in the late 2010s, Yahoo! Screen in a one-year deal exclusively for clips only, then Peacock upon its launch in 2020, a majority of the show&#x27;s &quot;best of&quot; specials would still run on the E! network in that span. The show would finally return to syndication in September 2024, as free-to-air network TBD would pick up the series as part of a refocus of the network towards comedy programming.

On March 16, 2017, NBC announced it would air the final four episodes of the 42nd season live in all mainland U.S. time zones for the first time, creating a communal experience across the states. NBC executive Robert Greenblatt explained the show&#x27;s significant viewership had made it part of the &quot;national conversation&quot;, and thus, they felt it would be appropriate for the entire country to be &quot;in on the joke at the same time&quot;. NBC announced on September 19, 2017, that all subsequent episodes would air live coast-to-coast in the U.S.

Beginning in the 2021–2022 season, the show has been simultaneously broadcast live on the Peacock streaming service. The show has also experimented with live broadcasts on YouTube, beginning with a 2021 Elon Musk-hosted episode.

===Delays===
The episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by Rosanna Arquette, was not aired until November 8 due to NBC broadcasting game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox; the game entered extra innings and ended at 12:32 a.m. Eastern, causing that night&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;SNL&quot; to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30 a.m. and broadcast two weeks later, with Mets pitcher Ron Darling delivering a jocular &quot;apology&quot; as the cold open.

The episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes late due to an XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later. The fledgling football league ended up changing their rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off when &quot;SNL&quot; started, so that no such incident would happen again.

The November 7, 2020 episode, hosted by Dave Chappelle, began at 12:10 a.m. Eastern after a Clemson-Notre Dame college football game went into double overtime.

The October 12, 2024 episode, hosted by Ariana Grande, began at 11:35 p.m. Eastern due to a primetime college football overrun.

==International versions==
Because &quot;SNL&quot; has been a huge success in the United States, channels in other countries have created their own versions of the show, including Brazil, Germany, Egypt, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, and Poland.

In the mid-late 1980s Channel Four, in association with London Weekend Television, created a show for British audiences called &quot;Saturday Live&quot; and &quot;Friday Night Live&quot;, the repeat version was entitled &quot;Saturday Almost Live&quot;. It was based on the &quot;SNL&quot; format but had no direct connection to the American program.

A German version of &quot;SNL&quot; named &quot;RTL Samstag Nacht&quot; aired between 1993 and 1998 on RTL Television. Most episodes were hosted by German celebrities, however, some shows were hosted by American personalities who never hosted the American version, including Mel Brooks and Michael Winslow. Due to language barriers, they appeared only in opening monologues and in a limited number of sketches.

&quot;SNL&quot; in its original American version has aired in Israel since the early 2000s and is broadcast by satellite provider yes. There was a local SNL-based show named &quot;Am Israel Hai&quot; (People of Israel Live) back in 2002 but it was canceled after one season. Another SNL-esque Israeli show, &quot;Eretz Nehederet&quot; (A Wonderful Country), debuted in 2003 and continues to garner high ratings.

&quot;SNL&quot; also airs in the Middle East and North Africa, OSN First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.

In India and Sri Lanka, &quot;Saturday Night Live!&quot; airs an hour-long version on Comedy Central one week after the U.S. broadcast.

Spain&#x27;s version of the show was short-lived, lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied heavily from the American version, as they did their own versions of sketches already done on the original series. Italy&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live From Milan&quot; aired for four seasons and used original material.

On December 3, 2011, South Korea&#x27;s &quot;SNL Korea&quot; premiered on cable channel tvN. As of November 11, 2017, has completed nine seasons with 205 episodes. On September 4, 2021, it was rebooted and broadcast through Coupang Play, a South Korean OTT service. Only the broadcasting stations are different, but the members are similar or reinforced.

The Japanese version &quot;Saturday Night Live JPN&quot;, which ran for six months in 2011, was created in part with sponsor Coca-Cola and Lorne Michaels&#x27;s production company, Broadway Video, and broadcast on Fuji TV networks. The show followed the same format with a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.

In 2013, the Russian channel NTV aired the &quot;SNL&quot; adaptation entitled &quot;Суббота. Вечер. Шоу&quot; (&quot;Saturday. Evening. Show&quot;) and produced by Endemol&#x27;s Weit Media. Unlike other international versions, it was not broadcast live. Due to low ratings and negative reviews, the third episode was pulled from the schedule. The remaining six episodes eventually aired in January 2014, but without any announcements and under a different title: &quot;Сегодня. Вечер. Шоу&quot; (&quot;Today. Evening. Show&quot;). Reruns of the adaptation were aired at night on NTV throughout the first half of 2015.

In 2014, two ninety-minute specials were broadcast in French on Télé-Québec in the Canadian province of Quebec under the title &quot;SNL Québec&quot;; the specials were broadcast on February 8 and March 22, 2014. Hosted by Louis-José Houde and Stéphane Rousseau, it is the same format and length as the original &quot;SNL&quot; series. Certain sketches from the original program, such as Debbie Downer and Schweddy Balls, were adapted into French, while other sketches were original material written directly for the Quebec series. On May 13, 2014, &quot;SNL Quebec&quot; was renewed for another eight episodes to be broadcast monthly over the 2014–15 season ending with a &quot;Best of&quot; compilation. Télé-Québec announced in May 2015 the series would not be renewed due to funding cutbacks, and Ici Radio-Canada Télé subsequently signed the show&#x27;s production team and cast to produce a new series, &quot;Le nouveau show&quot;, for that network.

The French channel M6 launched the pilot episode of its &quot;SNL&quot; adaptation, &quot;Le Saturday Night Live&quot;, in January 2017.

The Polish division of Showmax video-on-demand streaming service launched the first season of its &quot;SNL&quot; adaptation, &quot;SNL Polska&quot; on December 2, 2017. The show received mixed reviews, however improving by the end of the series. Following the first series, a stand-alone &quot;Weekend Update&quot; was introduced in autumn 2018. In December 2018 Showmax announced the closure of its Polish branch, effectively cancelling the show.

On December 10, 2021, Deadline reported that Sky One was working on a British version of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==U.S. television ratings==
The show&#x27;s ratings increased steadily for several years after its debut, reaching their highest point in the fifth season. Ratings entered into a period of decline after that, never again reaching those heights, but had rebounded enough by the early 1990s to make the 1992–93 season the fifth-highest rated in the show&#x27;s history. Since then, ratings have trended steadily lower. As of 2018, thirteen of the show&#x27;s lowest-rated seasons occurred in the 2000s. The show&#x27;s ratings have often experienced temporary spikes during U.S. presidential election years.

==Reception==
In 2002 &quot;SNL&quot; was ranked tenth on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, while in 2007 it was honored with inclusion on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;TIME&quot;&quot;.

In June 2013 the show was placed at number 25 on the list of the 101 best written shows of all time by the Writers Guild of America, assessing series from the previous seventy years. In December 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #18 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time. A 2015 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named &quot;SNL&quot; as their #7 favorite show. It is currently the longest running sketch comedy show on television.

In 2016 a &quot;New York Times&quot; study of the fifty television shows with the most Facebook likes found that &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;is very much an urban show. It is most popular in cities throughout the country, and college towns. Amherst, Mass.; Madison, Wis.; and Ithaca, N.Y. are all among the top10.&quot;

Some critics have cautioned that the show is too dependent upon visiting guest actors and former &quot;SNL&quot; cast membersparticularly for its impersonations of prominent politicians in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election racesand is beginning to have difficulty producing relevant, truly funny content.

In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; #15 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

===Accolades===
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has won numerous awards since its debut, including 84 Primetime Emmy Awards, six Writers Guild of America Awards, and three Peabody Awards. In 2009 it received a total of thirteen Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record for the most award-nominated show in Primetime Emmy Award history, previously set with 124 by hospital drama &quot;ER&quot;. As of September 2022, it has received a record total of 305 Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Twenty-five cast members have received individual Primetime Emmy Award nominations in the show&#x27;s history. These nominations were mostly in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have been in the Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories for comedy series. Of the 54 total nominations for these twenty-five performers, four have won: Chevy Chase (1976), Gilda Radner (1978), Dana Carvey (1993), and Kate McKinnon (2016, 2017). In addition, Alec Baldwin received two Emmy nominations, winning once in 2017, for his recurring guest role as Donald Trump.

===Electoral effect===
&quot;SNL&quot; has also affected American elections, most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called &quot;SNL&quot; Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on &quot;SNL&quot;, with ten percent saying it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee. Chevy Chase&#x27;s bumbling impression of then-president Gerald Ford during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin stating &quot;I can see Russia from my house&quot; was actually spoken by &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin. The political content was abandoned briefly following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York, with Amy Poehler saying the writers did not want to produce politicized material.

Several politicians have appeared on &quot;SNL&quot;, including President Gerald Ford (in 1976, during the show&#x27;s first season), then-Senator Barack Obama (2007), Senator John McCain (2002 and 2008), Secretary Hillary Clinton (2008 and 2015), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey&#x27;s Palin impression, resulting in the show&#x27;s largest audience in fourteen years with fourteen million viewers. Senator Obama&#x27;s appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance. Donald Trump hosted the show in 2015, which was met with controversy. Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for the 2024 United States presidential election, made a guest appearance on November 2, 2024.

==Controversies==

Due to its live broadcast, the show has been the subject of numerous controversies and incidents since its inception, involving controversial performers and content, technical problems, profanities (both intentional and accidental), and joke plagiarism accusations.

One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was a 1992 appearance by singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during her performance in an effort to protest the Catholic Church. This led to hundreds of complaints from viewers and widespread criticism at the time, although retrospective opinion of her action has been more positive since the Church&#x27;s cover-up of abuse became public many years later.

Technical issues have also led to major controversies, such as in a widely publicized incident involving singer Ashlee Simpson in 2004 where she appeared to lip sync during her second performance, appearing flustered when the wrong song was played. Simpson was the only musical performer in the show&#x27;s history to unexpectedly leave the stage mid-performance, later apologizing for the incident and explaining that she had lost her voice earlier in the week.

===Representations of minorities===
Over the years, &quot;SNL&quot; has been criticized for stereotypical and sparse representation of racial and gender groups. A 2016 study of &quot;SNL&quot; episodes from 1975 to 2016 (826 total) revealed over 90% of episodes had white hosts, while 6.8% were black, 1.2% were Hispanic, and 1.1% were of another racial minority.

Chris Rock indicated he grew frustrated with being limited to sketches where he played stereotypical roles such as a rapper or Black political activist, and left the show to perform on &quot;In Living Color&quot;, which featured a mostly Black cast and would offer Rock more creative freedom. When longtime cast member Kenan Thompson suggested in 2013 that female African-American representation was low because producers were not finding such comedians who were &quot;ready&quot;, media outlets countered it was &quot;SNL&quot; that was not ready, and the racial disparity &quot;is symptomatic of problems deeply rooted in comedy and the entertainment industry at large&quot;. Thompson also refused to play any more black women on the show and demanded &quot;SNL&quot; hire black women instead.

&quot;SNL&quot; has had &quot;little representation from Asian actors, as cast members or hosts&quot;, in its run. Until Bowen Yang&#x27;s 2019 promotion from writer to on-air performer, there had been only three people of Asian descent in the cast: Fred Armisen (2002–2013) had a Korean grandfather; Rob Schneider (1988–1994) had a Filipina grandmother; and Nasim Pedrad (2009–2014) was born in Tehran, Iran. In the first forty-seven seasons, the show had seven hosts who were of Asian descent.

Denny Dillon was the first gay cast member in the 1980–81 season, but was in the closet at the time. Terry Sweeney was &quot;SNL&quot;″s first openly gay male cast member, appearing in the 1985–1986 season. Sweeney was also the first openly gay series regular on network television. Bowen Yang is the sixth LGBTQ cast member, hired in 2019. Numerous news outlets noted the disconnect of Michaels hiring Yang, an out gay Chinese-American cast member, at the same time as Shane Gillis, who was found to have aired what was perceived as homophobic and anti-Asian jokes and slurs on his podcast. Within days, a spokesperson for Michaels announced Gillis was fired due to the controversy. Later, Gillis went on to host &quot;SNL&quot; in 2024, during the 49th season. Molly Kearney became the first openly non-binary cast member in 2022.

Melissa Villaseñor joined as a featured player on the October 1, 2016, episode of &quot;SNL&quot;. Villaseñor was the second Latina cast member after Noël Wells, who is a quarter Mexican, and the first Latina to be promoted to repertory status.

==In other media==
===Home media===
Universal Studios Home Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment hold video rights to the series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few seasons, while Lionsgate&#x27;s share of the rights is a result of prior contracts with NBC signed before the NBC Universal merger. A majority of Lionsgate&#x27;s SNL DVDs are &quot;Best Of...&quot; compilations.

===Books===
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the first authorized book about the series, was published by Avon Books in 1977 and edited by Anne Beatts and John Head, with photography by Edie Baskin; all three worked for &quot;SNL&quot; at the time the book was published. The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches by the 1975–80 cast. In 1986 Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored &quot;Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live&quot;, a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons. &quot;Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years&quot;, by Michael Cader, was released in 1994 and presented information about the cast, characters, and other memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.

&quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot; was released in 2002. The book, written by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews with people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on air each week. In 2004 former cast member Jay Mohr released his memoir &quot;Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live&quot; about his struggles during his two seasons on the show between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on-air and the intense work schedule. Former cast member Bobby Moynihan described the book as &quot;a handbook on what NOT to do at &quot;SNL&quot;&quot;.

===Films===
&quot;SNL&quot; has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), which earned over $115million on a $27million budget.

In 1990 Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled &quot;The Saturday Night Live Movie&quot; with many of the show&#x27;s then-current writing staff, including Al Franken, Tom Davis, Greg Daniels, Jim Downey, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Robert Smigel, and George Meyer, contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990, before being abandoned.

The success of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992) encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993), followed by &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; (1994); &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot; (1995); &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Superstar&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did notnotably, &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;, which did so badly at the box office that the studio that made the film, Touchstone Pictures (owned by the Walt Disney Company, which also owns NBC&#x27;s rival ABC), pulled it only one week after releasing it, and &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot;, which lost $14million. Many of these films were produced by Paramount Pictures. The films based on &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; were produced by Universal Studios, which merged with NBC in 2004 to form NBC Universal (Universal also has a joint venture with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios&#x27; films).

The character Bob Roberts from the Tim Robbins film of the same title (1992) first appeared on &quot;SNL&quot; in a short film about the conservative folk singer.

In addition, the 1999 comedy film &quot;Office Space&quot; originated from a series of animated short films by Mike Judge that aired on &quot;SNL&quot; in 1993.

The fictitious American folk music trio The Folksmen first appeared on &quot;SNL&quot;, performing the song &quot;Old Joe&#x27;s Place&quot; before later appearing in the film &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest, who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group Spinal Tap. At the time of the appearance (the 1984–85 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.

&quot;Mr. Bill&#x27;s Real Life Adventures&quot; is based on the Mr. Bill sketches from early seasons of &quot;SNL&quot;.

In 2024, the film &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was released, about the production of the first &quot;SNL&quot; episode to air on October 11, 1975, with Gabriel LaBelle as Michaels.

===Commercials===
Over the years popular characters from the show have appeared in ad campaigns for an assortment of products.
===Music===
A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song &quot;Chevy&#x27;s Girls&quot; and comedy bits from the show (Weekend Update, &quot;Emily Litella&quot;, &quot;Gun Control&quot;); it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download.

In 2005, the comedy troupe The Lonely Island—consisting of &quot;SNL&quot; members Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone—gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic music video &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, written with fellow cast member Chris Parnell. The song became a surprise hit. It was posted on YouTube without permission from NBC; &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; popularized the website, which had launched five months earlier. Schaffer said that for years after the video was released, &quot;You couldn’t kind of write a story about YouTube without mentioning us.&quot;

Further successes with songs including &quot;Like a Boss&quot;, &quot;Jizz in My Pants&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on a Boat&quot;, &quot;We Like Sportz&quot;, &quot;Boombox&quot;, and &quot;Dick in a Box&quot;the latter of which won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2007saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, &quot;Incredibad&quot; (2009) and &quot;Turtleneck &amp; Chain&quot; (2011), containing &quot;SNL&quot;-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by Universal Republic Records, which was provided with a license to the &quot;SNL&quot; songs by NBC and Broadway Video.

===Documentaries===
On January 16, 2025, the four episode documentary series &quot;SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night&quot;, featuring rare footage and interviews with more than 60 contributors—including cast members, writers, and execs—became available to stream on Peacock. A sequel, feature-length documentary &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen... 50 Years of SNL Music&quot;, which discusses SNL&#x27;s music performances and musical-comedy sketches, will then be available to stream on Peacock on January 27, 2025.

===Other===
Several programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. A &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A&amp;E episode of &quot;Biography&quot; which covered the production process, as well as an episode of &quot;TV Tales&quot; in 2002 on E!. In 2010, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, a 94-minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco&#x27;s New York University film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded. On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a -hour special on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members, and special guest appearances from previous hosts.

In September 2011 ice cream company Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a limited-edition ice cream called &quot;Schweddy Balls&quot;, inspired by a 1998 sketch of the same name starring Alec Baldwin, Ana Gasteyer, and Molly Shannon. According to the company, the ice cream became their fastest-selling limited-edition flavor. The ice cream was also subject to criticism and boycotts by One Million Moms, a project of the American Family Association, over the &quot;vulgar&quot; name. Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor, but declined to say if the decision was at their own discretion or based on the One Million Moms boycotts. In June 2014 two new flavors inspired by SNL sketches were introduced: &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, based on a sketch of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and &quot;Gilly&#x27;s Catastrophic Crunch&quot; based on the recurring &quot;Gilly&quot; sketches featuring Kristen Wiig. &quot;Two Wild and Crazy Pies&quot;, based on the catchphrase of the recurring Festrunk Brothers, was introduced in September 2014, followed by &quot;Wayne&#x27;Swirled&quot;, which was inspired by the eponymous Wayne&#x27;s World in February 2015.

<text>Daniel P. McTeague, (born October 16, 1962) is a Canadian businessman and former politician. McTeague served for eighteen years as Member of Parliament for the Ontario riding of Pickering—Scarborough East.

==Early life==
Fluently bilingual, McTeague graduated from the University of Toronto and worked as an intern in Ottawa to Paul Cosgrove, then Minister of Public Works and Canada Mortgage and Housing and later with the Royal Bank. After graduation he worked as an assistant to Alvin Curling, Ontario Minister of Housing. From 1989 to 1993, he worked as a public relations specialist with Toyota Canada.

==Political career (1993–2011)==
McTeague was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 federal election and was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2008. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs tasked with protecting Canadians abroad, until the Liberals lost the 2006 election. He served as the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Industry.

McTeague helped free William Sampson from prison in Saudi Arabia by obtaining a letter of forgiveness from Justin Rodway, the eldest son of the victim of Sampson&#x27;s alleged crime. McTeague also aided in securing the release of other Canadians from detention abroad, including Abdullah Al-Malki, Muyadad Nureddin and Al-Matti.

His earlier legislative achievements included a bill passing into law the recognition of the third week in April as the Annual Donor Organ Week and setting Parliamentary precedent as the first backbench MP to successfully amend the Criminal Code and see his bill making fleeing a peace officer using a vehicle unlawful. So rare was this feat, that upon passing of third reading in the Senate, his Bill, C-202, was promulgated into law before one judge on the Supreme Court of Canada, without the normal requirement of waiting the several months of publication in the Canada Gazette. His Act, now section 249.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, took effect on February 7, 2000.

In 2001, he criticized Canada&#x27;s restrictive drug patent laws and pushed the Chrétien government from within to relax those laws to help address the African AIDS pandemic.

On November 22, 2005, McTeague asked Immigration Minister Joe Volpe to restrict rapper 50 Cent from entering Canada, citing the death of a constituent at the performer&#x27;s previous concert in Toronto in 2004. 50 Cent&#x27;s tour went on as scheduled but McTeague&#x27;s intervention succeeded in seeing at least half of the accompanying members of the rapper&#x27;s troupe, the G-Unit, banned in Canada as a result of the objections.

With Canadian troops facing casualties in Afghanistan, McTeague criticized the government practice of docking injured soldier&#x27;s &quot;operational pay&quot; once out of theatre. In May 2007, he supported the Dinnings family in their public dispute with the federal Conservative government, which led to an increase of the funeral stipend to families of fallen Canadian soldiers.

===Registered Education Savings Plan===
McTeague tabled a private member bill that proposed to give parents substantial tax breaks for saving education money; taxpayers who deposited $5,000 into a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their children&#x27;s post-secondary education would earn a $5,000 tax deduction, similar to the deduction allowed for contributions to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Under the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), introduced in Finance Minister Jim Flaherty&#x27;s 2008 budget, there was no deduction for annual contributions. The benefit to TFSAs is withdrawals can be done at any time, for any reason, with no tax consequences. Withdrawals from RRSPs are taxed and there are restrictions on annual withdrawals from RESPs. 

Ted Menzies, Conservative Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, lashed out at the proposal and suggested McTeague explain how the government would pay for his proposal, while Garth Turner strongly supported McTeague&#x27;s bill and called it &quot;the greatest financial tool in a generation.&quot; The Green Party said the government should have ceased threats to trigger an election over the RESP private member’s bill. McTeague&#x27;s bill passed through the House of Commons of Canada on March 5, 2008, after Speaker of the House, Liberal Peter Milliken, ruled the bill in order as it did not require a royal recommendation, given that it did not contemplate spending money, only reducing revenue. Flaherty introduced a ways and means motion which nullified McTeague&#x27;s bill.

===Rising energy costs===
From January 2015 to June 2019, McTeague was a gas price analyst at GasBuddy.com. Since then, he has continued to publish his views on that topic on Twitter.

===Support for the abolition of usage based billing===
McTeague, along with Jack Layton of the NDP, on February 4, 2011 attended a rally in Toronto organized by Calvin Tennant against an internet usage based billing decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). He vowed to fight to reverse the CRTC decision, calling it the &quot;Giga-Tax&quot;.

===Order of Canada criticism===
McTeague criticized the induction into the Order of Canada of Dr. Henry Morgentaler, saying that the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada strayed into social comment with its &quot;provocative&quot; choice, and argued that it was not the mandate of the ten-person panel.

==After politics==
In 2019, he became President of Canadians for Affordable Energy after the group&#x27;s founder John Williamson returned to Parliament.

===Criticism of the Liberal Party===

Despite being a member of the Liberal Party for the entirety of his tenure as an MP, McTeague has been vocal in his criticism of the party under the leadership of Justin Trudeau. In a 2024 interview with &quot;NowMedia&quot;, McTeague argued the Liberals were no longer a centrist party, and said that he had left the party. McTeague also criticized the Liberals&#x27; implementation of the carbon tax, spending policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and natural resource policies.

<text>Alyssa Jayne Milano ( ; born December 19, 1972) is an American actress and activist. She has played Samantha Micelli in &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; (1984–1992), Jennifer Mancini in &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1997–1998), Phoebe Halliwell in &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998–2006), Billie Cunningham in &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; (2007–2008), Savannah &quot;Savi&quot; Davis in &quot;Mistresses&quot; (2013–2014), Renata Murphy in &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later&quot; (2017), and Coralee Armstrong in &quot;Insatiable&quot; (2018–2019). As an activist, Milano is known for her role in the MeToo movement in October 2017.

== Early life ==
Alyssa Jayne Milano was born in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of New York City&#x27;s Brooklyn borough on December 19, 1972, the daughter of fashion designer and talent manager Lin Milano and film music editor Thomas M. Milano. She is of Italian descent and has a brother named Cory, who is a decade younger. She was raised Catholic, and still practices the faith.

== Career ==
=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Milano began her career at age seven, when her babysitter, without notifying her parents, took her to an audition for the national touring company of &quot;Annie&quot;. She was one of four selected from more than 1,500 girls. During the course of her work in the play, Milano and her mother were on the road for 18 months. After returning to New York, Milano appeared in television commercials, and performed several roles in off-Broadway productions, including the first American musical adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. While accompanying a friend from &quot;Annie&quot; to the office of a New York agent, the agent signed Milano. She does not feel that growing up in front of the camera harmed her childhood and has said: &quot;I love my family very much – they&#x27;ve really backed my career. I consider myself to be normal: I&#x27;ve got to clean my room, and help in the kitchen.&quot; In August 1984, Milano made her film debut in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Old Enough&quot;, which she recalled as a &quot;great way of starting out&quot;. The film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won First Prize.

Milano auditioned as the daughter of Tony Danza&#x27;s character on the sitcom &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; After winning the part, she and her family moved to Los Angeles, where the show was produced. It premiered on ABC on September 20, 1984. Throughout &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, Milano developed a close relationship with co-star Danza. Commenting on their early years together, Danza observed: &quot;She was just the sweetest little girl of all time ... She became much like my daughter.&quot; The series established Milano as a teen idol, and provided her opportunities for other roles. Her education was split between school and an on-set tutor with whom Milano would work for three hours a day.
At age 12, Milano co-starred in &quot;Commando&quot; (1985) as Jenny Matrix, the daughter of John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Subsequently, she starred in the children&#x27;s film &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, which did not achieve much praise or attention and &quot;Variety&quot; magazine noted in its review: &quot;Milano as the catalyzing daughter Jennifer adapts to the ghostly Sir Simon without a qualm; that, of course, is the true charm of the story, but Milano doesn&#x27;t exhibit enough presence to match the droll, charming Gielgud&quot;. A few years later this film was shown in Japan, prompting a producer to offer Milano a five-album record deal. Milano&#x27;s albums, which she described as &quot;bubblegum pop&quot;, scored platinum in the country, though she later criticised their musical quality. She has noted her love of English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) during her teens.

On stage, Milano starred in &quot;Tender Offer&quot;, a one-act play written by Wendy Wasserstein, &quot;All Night Long&quot; by American playwright John O&#x27;Keefe, and the first American musical adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. She returned to the theater in 1991, producing and starring in a Los Angeles production of &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; from December 26, 1991, to January 19, 1992. Milano starred in two 1988 television films, &quot;Crash Course&quot; and &quot;Dance &#x27;til Dawn&quot;. Both projects allowed her to work alongside close personal friend Brian Bloom, who worked with his brother Scott with her in episodes of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot;; this working camaraderie would later expand in 1993 when Milano made a cameo appearance in Bloom&#x27;s film &quot;The Webbers&quot;. She produced a teen workout video, &quot;Teen Steam&quot;, and achieved some fame outside the US with her music career, which lasted until the early 1990s. Even though she scored platinum in Japan, Milano had no interest to pursue a music career in the United States: &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in crossing over. I&#x27;d much rather have it released where it&#x27;s appreciated than laughed at.&quot; Simultaneously, she wrote a weekly column called &quot;From Alyssa, with love&quot; for the teen magazine &quot;Teen Machine&quot;.

Milano played a teenage prostitute in the 1992 independent film &quot;Where the Day Takes You&quot;. The film, which focuses on a group of young runaway and homeless teenagers, was shot on and around Hollywood Boulevard and was met with positive critical reception. It was nominated for the Critics Award at the Deauville Film Festival, and won the Golden Space Needle Award at the Seattle International Film Festival. Although Milano feared that viewers would only recognize her as &quot;the girl from &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;&quot;, she was noticed by the media, which helped her land the role of Amy Fisher in the high-profile television film &quot;Casualties of Love: The &quot;Long Island Lolita&quot; Story&quot;, one of three TV films based on Fisher&#x27;s shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco. Milano said that her portrayal of Fisher in the film, which was based on the Buttafuoco&#x27;s point of view, &quot;was the least &#x27;Alyssa&#x27; of anything [she had] done.&quot; The film was shot from November–December 1992. She welcomed the cancellation of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, as she was ready to move on to other roles and enthusiastic to &quot;showcase&quot; what she was able to do. Looking back on eight years of playing the same role, Milano commented, &quot;Creatively, it&#x27;s been very frustrating. I gave her more of a personality. I changed her wardrobe, cut her hair, anything to give her new life.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Milano auditioned for nearly every film role in her age bracket, including B movies, and finally tried to shed her &quot;nice girl&quot; image by appearing nude in several erotic films targeted at adults, such as &quot;Embrace of the Vampire&quot;, &quot;Deadly Sins&quot; and &quot;Poison Ivy II: Lily&quot;. She said the nude appearances taught her to begin requiring a nudity clause in her contracts giving her &quot;full control&quot; over all her nude scenes. In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in &quot;Embrace of the Vampire&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to say that I was manipulated into doing things that I didn&#x27;t want to do. I did it because it was a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it&#x27;s not all explicit.&quot;

She starred in other roles, such as &quot;Candles in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Sorority Girl&quot;, &quot;The Surrogate&quot;, &quot;To Brave Alaska&quot; and &quot;Fear&quot;, which did not receive very positive reviews, although Jack Matthews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Milano&#x27;s performance in &quot;Fear&quot; &quot;very good&quot;. Milano starred in the lead role in &quot;Hugo Pool&quot; (1997). In late 1996, Milano was offered a role of Jennifer Mancini on the drama &quot;Melrose Place&quot; by producer Aaron Spelling: &quot;We were looking for someone with sparkle. Alyssa was the perfect choice.&quot; She left early in season seven. In 1998, she was cast as Phoebe Halliwell, one of the three lead characters on Spelling&#x27;s show &quot;Charmed&quot;. She and Holly Marie Combs became producers for the show during season four. The series ran for eight seasons, concluding in 2006.
Also in 1998, she played Mark Hoppus&#x27;s love interest in the music video for Blink-182&#x27;s &quot;Josie&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

In the early 2000s, Milano played Eva Savelot in MCI Inc. commercials for that company&#x27;s 1-800-COLLECT campaign. In 2007, Milano&#x27;s commercial work included two 2007 television ads for Veet and Sheer Cover. That year, she filmed a pilot for ABC called &quot;Reinventing the Wheelers&quot;, which was not picked up for the 2007–08 season. That season she appeared in ten episodes of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;. Milano was part of TBS&#x27;s special coverage installment &quot;Hot Corner&quot; for the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs. A fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in April 2007, Milano began writing a baseball blog on the Major League Baseball&#x27;s website. That year she reported at Fenway Park during the ALDS between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

The same year, she launched her signature &quot;Touch&quot; line of team apparel for female baseball fans, selling it through her blog on Major League Baseball&#x27;s website. It also became available in 2009 through a boutique store located in Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets. She has an interest in the Los Angeles Kings, a National Hockey League team, and is involved with a related clothing line. In 2008, she expanded that to NFL football, as a New York Giants fan. Since Milano is from the same hometown as NFL Network&#x27;s Rich Eisen, she revealed some of her family&#x27;s connections with the Giants. In 2013, Milano expanded &quot;Touch&quot; into NASCAR.

On March 20, 2009, it was announced that Milano voiced Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn in &quot;&quot;. In a 2010 interview she told the press that she had &#x27;a blast&#x27; working on the game, although she recalled it being &#x27;odd&#x27; having to grunt in a room alone. On March 24, 2009, her book on her baseball fandom, &quot;Safe At Home: Confessions of a Baseball Fanatic&quot;, was released. Milano has signed on to star in and produce &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Boyfriend&quot;, a romantic comedy in which she plays a woman with a relationship dilemma. Milano starred in the sitcom &quot;Romantically Challenged&quot; as Rebecca Thomas, a recently divorced single mother attorney in Pittsburgh who has not dated &quot;since Bill Clinton was president&quot;. The series premiered on ABC on April 19, 2010. The series was cancelled after airing four episodes. Milano produced and led the cast of Lifetime&#x27;s TV film &quot;Sundays at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. which was her second collaboration with Lifetime, after &quot;Wisegal&quot; (2008).

=== 2010s and 2020s ===

In 2011, Milano appeared in two comedy films, &quot;Hall Pass&quot; and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;. In 2013, Milano created the comic book series &quot;Hacktivist&quot;, which was written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly, drawn by Marcus To, and published by Archaia Entertainment. The book, which explores the modern world of hacking and global activism, is described as &quot;a fast-paced cyber-thriller about friendship and freedom in a time of war&quot;. The publication was released digitally in late 2013, while the first print edition issue of the four-issue miniseries was published in January 2014. A hardcover edition collecting all four issues was released in July 2014. The series received positive reviews, as it holds a score of 8.1 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup.

In June 2013, she played Savannah Davis in ABC drama series &quot;Mistresses&quot;, which is about the scandalous lives of four girlfriends, but she left the show after season two, due to conflict between filming location and family issues. She signed on as host and judge &quot;Project Runway: All Stars&quot; beginning with season three. On March 2, 2015, Milano was a guest host on &quot;The Talk&quot;. In September 2015, Milano began to make appearances as a brand ambassador for the preschool television channel Sprout, being billed as the network&#x27;s &quot;mom-bassador&quot;. In 2017 and 2018, Milano joined the cast of two Netflix comedy series: &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later&quot; and &quot;Insatiable&quot;. In 2018 she was cast in the lead role in &quot;Tempting Fate&quot;, based on the best-selling book by Jane Green.

In 2019, she released a children&#x27;s book &quot;Hope: Project Middle School Book&quot; which is part of her &#x27;Hope&#x27; book series which she co-authors with Debbie Rigaud. Also in 2019, Milano began hosting the podcast &quot;Alyssa Milano: Sorry Not Sorry&quot;. The podcast deals with social and political commentary and frequently features actors, activists, and political luminaries. In 2020, Milano was a recurring star on the Quibi comedy &quot;The Now&quot;. In 2021, Milano was cast to star in the Netflix film adaptation of Nora Roberts&#x27; novel &quot;Brazen Virtue&quot;.

In October 2021, Milano&#x27;s book &quot;Sorry Not Sorry&quot; was released. It contains 32 essays describing her activism and thoughts on current political and social issues. On October 29, 2021, she signed a first-look production deal with A&amp;E Studios. She also signed a deal with the United Talent Agency (UTA) more recently, on December 13, 2021. Milano will perform the role of Roxie Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot; on Broadway in the fall of 2024.

=== Other ventures ===
She has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Cleo&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Veronica&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;. She has appeared in television commercials for Wen, Candies, Veet, Hi-C and Atkins diet. She was a spokesmodel for Sheer Cover cosmetics.

== Activism ==
In the late 1980s, Milano contacted Ryan White, a preteen boy ostracized for having AIDS, and a fan of hers. She attended a party for him where she sat with him for six hours making friendship bracelets. They appeared together on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, where Milano kissed White on the cheek to emphasize that people do not catch the disease through casual contact.

Since 2004, Milano has canvassed for national, state, and local candidates.

In October 2004, Milano participated in UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; campaign as the national spokesperson. She raised approximately US$50,000 for South African women and children with AIDS by selling her own and schools&#x27; photo work.

In support of PETA, she appeared in a 2007 advertisement for them, advocating vegetarianism, in a dress made entirely of vegetables.

In June 2007, The Sabin Vaccine Institute named Milano a Founding Ambassador for the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases, an alliance formed to advocate and mobilize resources in the fight to control neglected tropical diseases, to which Milano donated US$250,000. She is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the United States of America. Her field work for the organization has included a 2004 trip to Angola to speak with HIV-positive women and people disfigured by land mines during the country&#x27;s civil war; a trip to India to meet displaced mothers living in squalor following the 2004 tsunami; and a 2010 trip to the settlement of Kolonia in western Kosovo to witness impoverished living conditions. Milano wrote on her blog that the latter trip was &quot;the hardest experience I&#x27;ve had on a field visit&quot;, and described a waste dump close to the settlement where children spent time looking for metal to sell or scavenging for food.
For her 37th birthday, December 19, 2009, Milano ran an online fundraising campaign for . Her original goal was to raise US$25,000, but a donation from her husband led to a total of over US$75,000 on December 18. The fundraiser ran until December 26. In September 2013, Milano released a parody of a celebrity sex tape on Funny or Die that drew attention to the Syrian civil war.

In 2014, Milano, with the South Korean rescue group,&quot; CARE&quot;, and &quot;The Fuzzy Pet Foundation&quot; in Santa Monica, helped rescue a South Korean Jindo mix dog, found covered in mange, chained, and raised for dog-meat.

On October 15, 2017, Milano posted the message that re-launched what is known as the #MeToo movement, which was started in 2006 by Tarana Burke. According to Milano, a friend suggested that she post a message on her Twitter account encouraging survivors of sexual harassment and assault to post #metoo as a status update. This was to gauge the widespread problem of sexual misconduct. She was inspired to bring awareness to the commonality of sexual abuse of women in the wake of Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for sex crimes against women in the film industry. Milano emphasized that the basis of her hashtag was to create a platform where women had an &quot;opportunity without having to go into detail about their stories if they did not want to&quot;.

In 2018, she was announced as a co-chair of the Health Care Voter campaign. She wrote an op-ed in &quot;Time&quot; on why health care would decide her vote in 2018. In July 2018, and again in December 2020, Milano encouraged Twitter users to seek out VoteRiders to help eliminate confusion about voter ID laws.

Milano, who spoke at the 2018 Women&#x27;s March, refused to participate in 2019, citing the failure of 2019 Women&#x27;s March leaders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour to condemn the homophobia, antisemitism, and transphobia of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. In 2018, she was selected as one of the &quot;Silence Breakers&quot;, who were picked as &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year.

In May 2019, Milano advocated celibacy in the form of a sex strike in retaliation of a recently passed abortion law in the U.S. state of Georgia.

In October 2021, Milano was arrested during a voting rights demonstration outside the White House.

In November 2022, Milano announced via Twitter that she had exchanged her Tesla for a Volkswagen electric vehicle. She declared, &quot;I gave back my Tesla, I bought the VW ev. I love it. I&#x27;m not sure how advertisers can buy space on Twitter. Publicly traded company&#x27;s products being pushed in alignment with hate and white supremacy doesn&#x27;t seem to be a winning business model.&quot; Critics were quick to point out Volkswagen&#x27;s past relationship with the Nazi Party which founded the then state-owned company in 1937.

On May 28, 2024, Milano became an ambassador of the UNITED24 global initiative in support of Ukraine in the field of education and science.

== Political views ==
Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Milano co-founded #NoRA, a coalition of artists, activists, and survivors of gun violence in an effort to reduce the influence of the National Rifle Association of America in American government. In September 2019, Milano met with Ted Cruz and Fred Guttenberg to discuss gun violence. Guttenberg said this was &quot;a really important day.&quot;

Milano helped raise money for Richard Dien Winfield, a Democrat in Georgia&#x27;s 2018 10th congressional district race. Milano phone banked, a political campaign strategy to collect voter data and get out the vote, with Piper Perabo and drove people to the polls for the United States Senate special election in Alabama on December 12, 2017, to vote for Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Milano, with actor Christopher Gorham, drove voters to the polls during early voting and on March 27, 2017, for Georgia&#x27;s 6th congressional district 2017 special election for Jon Ossoff, and she later posted photos of herself with the voters on Instagram. Milano and Gorham had been in the area for the pilot of &quot;Insatiable&quot;.

In 2015, Milano endorsed Bernie Sanders for president of the United States. In 2016, after the Democratic Party presidential primaries, she expressed support for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was also involved in get-out-the-vote efforts for Rob Quist.

In March 2020, Milano endorsed former US vice president Joe Biden for president of the United States. She declined to withdraw her endorsement of Biden despite a sexual assault allegation against him. On April 27, Milano tweeted that she was &quot;aware of the new developments in Tara Reade&#x27;s accusation against Joe Biden. I want Tara, like every other survivor, to have the space to be heard and seen without being used as fodder. I hear and see you, Tara.&quot; This was after criticism of Milano&#x27;s support for Biden where she appeared to backtrack on her previous stance for believing women. On April 28, in an op-ed for &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, Milano reiterated her support for Biden and considered &quot;Believing women was never about &#x27;Believe all women no matter what they say,&#x27; it was about changing the culture of NOT believing women by default.&quot;

In October 2023, Milano signed an open letter from several artists to Biden, calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

In 2024, Alyssa Milano supported Ukraine and joined UNITED24 ambassadors in raising funds for Ukraine.

== Personal life ==
Milano was involved with actor Corey Haim from 1987 to 1990. Milano and her parents, together with his manager at the time, unsuccessfully tried to get Haim help for his addiction. In 1993, she became engaged to actor Scott Wolf, but they broke off their engagement the following year. She had two abortions while in the relationship with Wolf.

In 1998, Milano sued adult websites for publishing unauthorized nude photographs of her.

On January 1, 1999, Milano married singer Cinjun Tate from alternative rock band Remy Zero. They separated on November 20, 1999, and were divorced on December 1, 1999.

In a 2004 interview, Milano explained how she deals with her dyslexia: &quot;I&#x27;ve stumbled over words while reading from teleprompters. Sir John Gielgud, whom I worked with on &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; years ago, gave me great advice. When I asked how he memorized his monologues, he said, &#x27;I write them down.&#x27; I use that method to this day. It not only familiarizes me with the words, it makes them my own.&quot;

After a year of dating, Milano became engaged to CAA agent David Bugliari in December 2008. They were married at Bugliari&#x27;s family home in New Jersey on August 15, 2009. They had a son on August 31, 2011, and a daughter on September 4, 2014.

In 2015, Milano sold her condominium in West Hollywood and moved to Bell Canyon, California, where she owns land and her then nine horses, eight chickens, two rabbits, and five dogs.

In 2017, Milano&#x27;s $10 million lawsuit against her business manager resulted in a cross-complaint.

In 2021 she was a passenger in a car crash. The car she was in was being driven by her uncle who had a medical condition. The car veered into another lane and crashed.

<text>Nkosi Johnson (born Xolani Nkosi;  – ) was a South African child with HIV and AIDS who greatly influenced public perceptions of the pandemic and its effects before his death at the age of 12. He was ranked fifth amongst SABC3&#x27;s Great South Africans. At the time of his death, he was the longest-surviving child born HIV-positive in South Africa.

==Life==
Nkosi was born to Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi in a village near Dannhauser in 1989. He never knew his father. Nkosi was HIV-positive from birth, and was legally adopted by Gail Johnson, a Johannesburg Public Relations practitioner, when his own mother, debilitated by the disease, was no longer able to care for him.

The young Nkosi Johnson first came to public attention in 1997, when a primary school in the Johannesburg suburb of Melville refused to accept him as a pupil because of his HIV-positive status. The incident caused a furore at the highest political level – South Africa&#x27;s Constitution forbids discrimination on the grounds of medical status – and the school later reversed its decision.

Nkosi&#x27;s birth mother died of HIV/AIDS in the same year that he started school. His own condition steadily worsened over the years, although, with the help of antiretroviral medication and treatment, he was able to lead a fairly active life at school and at home.

Nkosi was the keynote speaker at the 13th International AIDS Conference, where he encouraged people with HIV/AIDS to be open about the disease and to seek equal treatment. Nkosi finished his speech with the words:
Care for us and accept us – we are all human beings. We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else – don&#x27;t be afraid of us – we are all the same!
Nelson Mandela referred to Nkosi as an &quot;icon of the struggle for life.&quot;

Together with his adoptive mother, Nkosi founded a refuge for HIV positive mothers and their children, Nkosi&#x27;s Haven, in Johannesburg. In November 2005, Gail represented Nkosi when he posthumously received the International Children&#x27;s Peace Prize from the hands of Mikhail Gorbachev. Nkosi&#x27;s Haven received a prize of US$100,000 from the KidsRights Foundation.

In late 2000, after returning from a trip abroad to the United States, Johnson began feeling unwell. Soon after Christmas that year he collapsed. Diagnosed with brain damage, he had several seizures and became comatose. He died on 1 June 2001. Nkosi is buried at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg.

==Legacy==
* Nkosi&#x27;s life is the subject of the book &quot;We Are All the Same&quot; by Jim Wooten.
* Poet M. K. Asante dedicated his 2005 book &quot;Beautiful. And Ugly Too&quot; to Nkosi. The book also features a poem entitled &quot;The Spirit of Nkosi Johnson.&quot;
* A song titled &quot;Do All You Can&quot; subtitled Nkosi&#x27;s song was recorded by the spiritual musical group Devotion.
* Nkosi&#x27;s words are the inspiration of the song &quot;We Are All the Same&quot; written by NALEDi in June 2001. This song was recorded and released on her 2003 album &quot;In The Rain&quot;.
* The head office of CAFCASS at the Department for Education and Skills (Sanctuary Buildings), London has a meeting room named after Johnson.
* Stellenbosch University has a residence named after him at their Medical Campus in Tygerberg.
* The award statuette received by the winner of the International Children&#x27;s Peace Prize is named Nkosi after him.
* On 4 February 2020, Google celebrated Johnson with a doodle in his honor on what would have been his 31st birthday.

<text>Mark 11 is the eleventh chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, beginning Jesus&#x27; final &quot;hectic&quot; week, before his death as he arrives in Jerusalem for the coming Passover. It contains the stories of Jesus&#x27; entry into Jerusalem, his cursing of the fig tree, his conflict with the Temple money changers, and his argument with the chief priests and elders about his authority. Biblical commentator Christopher Tuckett notes that &quot;the Passion narrative in Mark is usually adjudged to start at chapter 14, but there is a real sense in which it can be said to start ... at the start of chapter 11&quot;.

==Text==
The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 33 verses.

===Textual witnesses===
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:
*Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; complete)
*Codex Bezae (~400; complete)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete)

==Timescale==
Verses 1-11 reflect the events commemorated by Christians on Palm Sunday. Verses 12-19 record actions of &quot;the next day&quot;, and end that evening. Verses 20-33 commence early (, &quot;prói&quot;), the following morning. Tuckett argues that Mark has &quot;very likely&quot; compressed a series of events into a single week whereas it is more plausible to assume they took place over a longer period of time.

== Triumphal entry into Jerusalem ==

Jesus and his disciples approach Bethphage and Bethany, towns on the edge of Jerusalem. Bethany was about two miles (3.2 km) east of the city on the Mount of Olives. Zechariah 14:4 has the final messianic battle occurring on the Mount of Olives. Bethphage is Aramaic for house of unripe figs, perhaps Mark&#x27;s foreshadowing of the story of the fig tree.

Jesus instructs two unnamed disciples to go ahead to the town and collect a colt, by which he almost assuredly means a young donkey, which he says will be tied up and has never been ridden, for him to ride. This is to fulfill Messianic prophecies, such as Zechariah 9:9, which is quoted in every Gospel except Mark. He instructs them that if anyone questions them they should say &quot;The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.&quot; , where Mark uses a double entendre as the &quot;Lord&quot; is meant as the owner of the colt and Jesus. The two go and find the colt as Jesus had predicted and start to untie it and people standing nearby ask what they are up to and they tell them what Jesus told them to say and amazingly they leave them alone. Mark leaves the event seemingly showing Jesus&#x27; power of prediction, but it could be argued that the people already knew Jesus as this town was his base of operations over the next several days: according to Mark and the other Gospels, Jesus also had friends there including Lazarus, his sisters, and Simon the Leper.

They bring the colt back to Jesus and put their cloaks on it and Jesus rides it into Jerusalem and people lay their cloaks and tree branches before him, singing him praise as the Son of David and a line from Psalm 118:25-26:
:&quot;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!&quot;
The Textus Receptus repeats the words ἑν ὀνόματι Κυρίου (&quot;en onomati kuriou&quot;, &quot;in the name of the Lord&quot;) in verse 10 as well as verse 9:
:&quot;Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord!&quot;
The ancient Codex Alexandrinus supports the duplication, but other early manuscripts, the Vulgate and the writings of Origen omit these words from verse 10.

The quotation from the Psalms is significant, as the composition of the Psalms is traditionally ascribed to King David. The word ὡσαννά, (&quot;Hosanna&quot;, &quot;save us please&quot;) is derived from Aramaic (הושע נא) (see Aramaic of Jesus#Hosana) from Hebrew (הושיעה נא) (, הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא), meaning &quot;help&quot; or &quot;save, I pray&quot;, &quot;an appeal that became a liturgical formula; as part of the Hallel ... familiar to everyone in Israel.&quot;

This event is celebrated by Christians as Palm Sunday, as the Gospel of John says the branches were taken from palm trees.
===Verse 11===
:&quot;And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.&quot;

He goes into the city and checks out the Temple. Where this entry took place is unknown, some believing it was through what is now called the Golden Gate where it was believed the Messiah would enter Jerusalem. Others think he might have used an entrance to the south that had stairs that led directly to the Temple. The crowd seems to have dispersed before Jesus reaches the Temple. He surveys the scene, but because it is late he leaves and goes back to Bethany. There were two areas of the Temple, the main area of the building where people&#x27;s activity took place and the inner sanctuary, also called the Temple, where the power of God was thought to reside.

== The fig tree and the money changers ==

As they leave Bethany next day, Jesus, who is hungry, sees a fig tree at (or from) a distance and goes over to see if it has figs. George Maclear suggests he may have fasted overnight. It is too early in the year for the tree to produce fruit, and it has none. Jesus curses it (see verse 21): &quot;May no one ever eat fruit from you again&quot;, words which his disciples hear.

They reach Jerusalem and Jesus goes straight to the Temple, Herod&#x27;s Temple, and starts, without explanation, throwing over tables and driving the dove salesman and money changers from the courtyard of the Temple and stops people from bringing anything for sale through the Temple courts (). The doves were used for sacrifices and the standard Greek or Roman money used by people had to be changed into special blessed Jewish or Tyrian money suitable for use. This is what Jesus told everyone there:

===Verse 17===
: &quot; And he taught, saying unto them,&quot;
:: &quot;Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer?&quot;
:: &quot;but ye have made it a den of thieves.&quot;
*Cross reference: Matthew 21:13, Luke 19:46
Jesus combines quotes from Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11 in Matthew 21:13, which is a parallel verse to this verse and Luke 19:46. Both are from expositions on the nature of the Temple. The quote from Isaiah comes from a section about how all who obey God&#x27;s will, Jewish or not, are to be allowed into the Temple so they can pray and therefore converse with God. The passage in Jeremiah is from a chapter on the futility of worship on the part of those who do not obey God&#x27;s will. People making money off of worshipping God right inside God&#x27;s own Temple seems to Jesus to be a corruption of God&#x27;s intention. &quot;Den of thieves&quot; might be a reference to extortionary pricing for the doves and money. The people are amazed by Jesus and his teaching, which drives the chief priests to plot to kill him. Jesus and his group however leave the city at the end of the day.

The incident with the money changers is recorded in all the Gospels. The synoptics have basically the same story as Mark. John 2:12-25 has the incident occurring at the start of his book and therefore Jesus&#x27; ministry. He expels the dove salesmen and money changers but does not quote from the Old Testament, instead saying &quot;How dare you turn my Father&#x27;s house into a market!&quot;. The disciples remember &quot;Zeal for your house will consume me.&quot; Most scholars hold that this is the same incident and that it really occurred shortly before Jesus&#x27; death. A minority hold that there were two incidents with the money changers, once at the beginning and once at the end of Jesus&#x27; mission.

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on Jesus: In the Temple
:This would appear to have been on the first day of the week and on the 10th of Nisan, when, according to the Law, it was necessary that the paschal lamb should be purchased. It is therefore probable that the entry into Jerusalem was for this purpose. In making the purchase of the lamb a dispute appears to have arisen between Jesus&#x27; followers and the money-changers who arranged for such purchases; and the latter were, at any rate for that day, driven from the Temple precincts. It would appear from Talmudic references that this action had no lasting effect, if any, for Simon ben Gamaliel found much the same state of affairs much later (Ker. i. 7) and effected some reforms (see Derenbourg in &quot;Histoire de la Palestine,&quot; p. 527). The act drew public attention to Jesus, who during the next few days was asked to define His position toward the conflicting parties in Jerusalem. It seemed especially to attack the emoluments of the priestly class, which accordingly asked Him to declare by what authority He had interfered with the sacrosanct arrangements of the Temple. In a somewhat enigmatic reply He placed his own claims on a level with those of John the Baptist — in other words, he based them on popular support.

The Jesus Seminar concluded that this was a &quot;pink&quot; act, &quot;a close approximation of what Jesus did&quot;, as recorded in , , and called the &quot;Temple incident&quot; and the primary cause of the crucifixion.

The next morning they pass by the fig tree again and Peter notices that it is now &quot;withered&quot;, and excitedly points it out to Jesus, who replies:

:&quot;Have faith in God...I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, &#x27;Go, throw yourself into the sea&#x27;, and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&quot; (22-23)

Similar statements can be found, apart from the fig tree story, in Matthew 17:20 and Luke 17:6 as well as in saying 48 of the Gospel of Thomas. Saint Paul also mentions faith that can move mountains in 1 Corinthians 13:2.

Some have argued that Jesus&#x27; action in regard to the fig tree seems illogical, since it was not the time of year for trees to bear fruit and one might assume that a divine Jesus would know that the tree would not have figs or could have simply produced the figs by a miracle as opposed to cursing the tree. Bertrand Russell, the agnostic philosopher, even listed this story as one of his reasons for not being a Christian. The cursing of the tree displays Jesus&#x27; power and the power of prayer coupled with full belief in God. Mark, placing the fig tree before and after the incident in the Temple, may be using the fig tree as a metaphor for what he sees as the barrenness of the priests and the withering of their teaching and authority due to their lack of true faith. Just like with the fig tree, Jesus had hoped to find &quot;fruit&quot;, the fruit of true worship of God, at the Temple but it is not the right time for this, and so the Temple, like the fig tree, is cursed. Exegetes often take this as one of Mark&#x27;s references to the destruction of the Temple by the Romans, and consequently their dating of Mark after this event.

The fig tree is again mentioned in Mark 13:28 by Jesus as part of his eschatological discourse, when its leaves will be full and it will be bearing fruit in the summer, as opposed to the current spring. Matthew has roughly the same story but not Luke or John, although Luke 13:6-9 has Jesus relating a &quot;parable&quot;, The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree, about a man not finding fruit on a fig tree. Thomas has Jesus talking about thistles not yielding figs in saying 45, which is also found in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 7:16.

This section of Mark ends with verses which are paralleled in and , which some have seen as a portion or a follow-on of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (see also Discourse on ostentation#Prayer): forgive others so that God may forgive you.

== Argument over Jesus&#x27; authority ==

Jesus then goes back to the Temple a third time, and as he walks through the Temple courts the priests, teachers (or scribes), and elders come up to him and question his authority to do the things that he is doing. They are trying to force him to say that his authority comes from God and can therefore accuse him of blasphemy.

Jesus says that he will tell them if they answer him one question: &quot;John&#x27;s baptism — was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!&quot; (30) The priests are then trapped. Mark implies that they did not believe in John, so that if they answer from heaven people will ask why they did not believe John. If they answer from men, they would be in conflict with the people, who &quot;did&quot; believe in John. They therefore refuse to answer and accordingly so does Jesus. This allows him to make the priests look bad and incompetent and also allows him to imply to the people that his authority is from God without saying it.

This is the first time in Mark that the chief priests, members of the Sanhedrin, are presented among Jesus&#x27; opponents. His previous conflicts had been with the Pharisees, allied with the Herodians, and the scribes or teachers of the law. Jesus has several arguments with the Jewish authorities beginning here and lasting through chapter 12, in which they try to trip him up but continually fail. The editors of the New American Bible Revised Edition note that by Mark 12:18, the &quot;mounting hostility&quot; of all these parties has been marshalled against Jesus.

==Comparison with other canonical gospels==
Matthew records these stories in chapter 21, with the differences that Jesus fights with the money changers the day He gets to Jerusalem and He heals several blind and lame people afterwards. Jesus curses the fig tree the next morning and it withers immediately.

Luke has all of this content in 19:28-20:8, except for the fig tree, and includes an explicit prediction by Jesus of Jerusalem&#x27;s destruction. He also states the Pharisees tried to silence His followers praise of Him during his entry into Jerusalem and, like Matthew, Luke says Jesus expelled the money changers on the day He arrived there.

John 12 has Jesus arrive in Bethany and have dinner with Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha after raising Him from the dead. The next day he finds the colt, John making no mention of the disciples, and rides it into Jerusalem with the same Psalm being sung. He then teaches the crowd in Jerusalem, John having the incident in the Temple before Jesus&#x27; final trip to Jerusalem.

<text>Joseph Francis Carr (October 22, 1879 – May 20, 1939) was an American sports executive in football, baseball, and basketball. He is best known as the president of the National Football League from 1921 until 1939. He was also one of the founders and president of the American Basketball League (ABL) from 1925 to 1927. He was also the promotional director for Minor League Baseball&#x27;s governing body from 1933 to 1939, leading an expansion of the minor leagues from 12 to 40 leagues operating in 279 cities with 4,200 players and attendance totaling 15,500,000.

A native and lifelong resident of Columbus, Ohio, Carr worked in his early years as a machinist for the Panhandle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a sports writer for a Columbus newspaper. While working for the Panhandle Division, he founded the Famous Panhandle White Sox baseball team in approximately 1900. He also revived the Columbus Panhandles football team in 1907, manning the team with railroad employees. The Panhandles became one of the inaugural members of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which was renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922.

From 1921 until his death in 1939, Carr served as president of the NFL. He oversaw the growth of the league from its origins, principally in small or medium-sized cities in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois into a national league with teams in major cities. During his tenure, many of the NFL&#x27;s premier franchises were established, including the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers, Philadelphia Eagles, Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins. Called the &quot;Father of Professional Football&quot;, Carr was one of the 17 inaugural inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.

==Early life==
Carr was born Joseph Francis Karr on October 23, 1879, at his parents&#x27; home in the Irish neighborhood on the East End of Columbus, Ohio. His father, Michael Karr, was a shoemaker who was born in Ireland in 1841 and immigrated to the United States in 1864. His mother Margaret Karr was born in New York to Irish immigrant parents. Carr had five older siblings, Bridget, James, John, Mary, and Michael, and a younger brother, Edward. In the late 1880s, Carr&#x27;s father became a sewer contractor, and in 1898 his mother died at age 58. At some point prior to the 1900 Census, the family changed its name to &quot;Carr&quot;.

Carr was educated at St. Patrick School and later St. Dominic&#x27;s School, both in Columbus. He left school at age 16 and became employed as a machinist. By 1899, Carr was working as a machinist for the Panhandle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In approximately 1900, Carr was also hired as an assistant sports editor and sports writer for the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot;, one of the three major newspapers in Columbus at the time. He wrote about all sports, but his boxing stories were especially popular. While working for the newspaper, he continued to also work as a machinist for the railroad.

==Columbus Panhandles==

In 1900, Carr organized a baseball team made up of employees of the railroad&#x27;s Panhandle Division. The team, known as the Famous Panhandle White Sox, played in the Capital City League and the Saturday Afternoon League in Columbus for several years. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Carr&#x27;s Panhandle club &quot;gained a reputation in semi-professional ranks throughout the country.&quot;

In 1907, Carr began a long association with the sport of football. He obtained permission from the Panhandle Athletic Club to reorganize the Columbus Panhandles football team, a team that had been formed in 1900 or 1901 and disbanded in 1904. He secured players from the railroad shop where he worked. The core of Carr&#x27;s Panhandles teams were six Nesser brothers who worked at the shop and were excellent athletes. To save on expenses, the players, who were railroad employees, used their passes to ride the train for free and practiced during the lunch hour on the railroad yards. Over the next 13 years, the Panhandles became known as a traveling team, as Carr saved money on travel expenses and stadium rental by playing mostly road games. In 1921, the &quot;Fort Wayne Journal&quot; called the Panhandles the &quot;most renowned professional football aggregation in the country.&quot;

Carr also continued his association with professional baseball while running the Panhandles, serving for several years as the secretary/treasurer and later president of the Ohio State League, a minor league baseball circuit.

As early as 1917, Carr was one of the leading advocates of a plan to develop a national professional football league. Sources are not in agreement as to what role, if any, he played in the formation of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which later became the National Football League (NFL). However, once the APFA was formed in 1920, Carr&#x27;s Panhandles played in the league&#x27;s inaugural season. The 1920 Panhandles team played only one home game and compiled a 2–7–2 record.

==NFL presidency==
At the annual meeting of the APFA held in Akron, Ohio, on April 30, 1921, Carr was elected as the organization&#x27;s president. He was re-elected president in January 1922, and he held that position for 18 years until his death in 1939.

Carr moved the APFA&#x27;s headquarters to Columbus, drafted a league constitution and by-laws, gave teams territorial rights, developed membership criteria for the franchises, and issued standings for the first time, so that the APFA would have a clear champion. Carr also began cleaning up other problems. By 1925, he introduced a standard player&#x27;s contract, fashioned after the ones being used in pro baseball, so players couldn&#x27;t jump from one team to another. Carr also declared that players under contract from the previous season could not be approached by another team unless first declared a free agent, thus introducing the reserve clause to professional football.

===Ban on use of college players===
In the early 20th century, college football was the dominant version of the sport, and professional teams would sometimes pay college players to play for them, often under assumed names. The practice was considered questionable ethically, resulting in taint being associated with the professional game. In order to remove the taint, and to engender peaceful relations with the college game, Carr made it one of his first goals as league president to impose a strict ban of the use of college football players. Indeed, at the same meeting at which Carr was elected president, the APFA adopted a rule prohibiting teams from using players who had not completed their college course.

Carr enforced the ban with vigor. During the 1921 APFA season, two or three college players from Notre Dame played for the Green Bay Acme Packers under assumed names. The incident resulted in the players losing their amateur status and being barred from further college football participation. In January 1922, Carr responded with the severest possible action, kicking the Packers out of the APFA. A few months later, a group headed by future Hall of Famer Curly Lambeau applied for and was granted the Green Bay franchise.

The 1925 Chicago Cardinals-Milwaukee Badgers scandal followed four years later. In December 1925, four high school students played for the Milwaukee Badgers in a game against the Chicago Cardinals. Carr responded by imposing stiff penalties. The Milwaukee club was fined $500 and given 90 days within which to &quot;dispose of all its club assets at which time the management must retire from the league.&quot; The Cardinals were fined $1,000 for their prior knowledge of the violation, and Cardinal player Art Foltz was temporarily banned from the league for life for having &quot;induced the boys to play&quot;.

The issue arose again when Red Grange, star halfback of the University of Illinois football team, signed with the Chicago Bears. Grange played his final college game on November 21, signed with the Bears the next day, and appeared in his first professional game on November 26. Two weeks later, Ernie Nevers signed a professional football contract for $50,000. To help ease tensions and promote the professional game in the college circles, Carr established a rule prohibiting college players to sign with professional teams until after their class had graduated. These decisions gave the NFL credibility and much needed support from the colleges and universities from across the country.

===Expansion of the APFA into a &quot;national&quot; league===
Carr faced numerous challenges as the league&#x27;s president. One of the principal challenges was expanding the league to a national scope. In 1920, 11 of the league&#x27;s 14 teams were located in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, including franchises in small cities such as Akron, Decatur, Rock Island, Canton, Hammond and Muncie. Carr believed that the league needed to model itself after Major League Baseball with teams in the country&#x27;s largest cities. In 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League, reflecting Carr&#x27;s goal of building a professional football league that was national in scope.

Another challenge was fostering stability in the league&#x27;s membership. In 1921, the APFA had 21 teams. Through the 1920s, NFL franchises were constantly setting up and then folding. From 1920 through 1932, 19 teams lasted one year and 11 teams lasted two years. During his tenure as league president, Carr sought to recruit financially capable owners to operate teams in the nation&#x27;s largest cities. He oversaw the establishment of successful teams in the nation&#x27;s largest cities, including the following:
* In January 1922, George Halas was granted a franchise to operate the Chicago Bears at Cubs Park. Halas took over the franchise previously known as the Decatur Staleys, which under Halas&#x27; leadership had won the APFA championship and begun paying its home games in Chicago in October 1921. Halas acquired ownership of the club from A. E. Staley and remained the owner of the Bears until his death in 1983.
* In 1925, and after rejecting applications submitted by numerous candidates seeking to operate a franchise in New York City, Carr recruited Tim Mara to start a club in New York City known as the New York Giants. The Mara family became one of the leading families in the NFL over the next 80 years, as both Tim Mara and his son, Wellington Mara, having been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
* In 1930, he moved the Dayton Triangles to Brooklyn as the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Brooklyn team remained with the NFL through the 1944 season.
* In 1932, Carr oversaw the founding of the Boston Redskins under the ownership of George Preston Marshall. He also oversaw the move of the Redskins to Washington, D.C., in 1937.
* In 1933, he added the Philadelphia Eagles to the NFL with Bert Bell as owner. Bell would later follow Carr as NFL president.
* Also in 1933, Carr added Pittsburgh Steelers (originally called the Pirates) under the ownership of Art Rooney. As a testament to Carr&#x27;s pursuit of stable ownership, the Rooney family continues to own the Steelers.
* In 1934, he oversaw the move of the Portsmouth Spartans to Detroit, where they were renamed the Detroit Lions.
* In 1937, the Cleveland Rams joined the NFL. (The Rams moved to Los Angeles nine years later.)

At the same time, many of the teams in smaller cities either moved or were dissolved altogether. One of the casualties was Carr&#x27;s original team, the Panhandles. They were renamed the Tigers in 1923, and played for four more seasons before dissolving after the 1926 season.

By 1937, the National Football League had reduced its membership to ten teams with nine of the ten teams located in major cities that also had Major League Baseball teams. Only Green Bay, Wisconsin, lacked a major league baseball team. By placing teams in big cities, Carr gave the NFL gained the foundation of stability it needed to survive during the Great Depression.

===1925 NFL championship controversy===
In 1925, the Pottsville Maroons, a first year NFL team, played an exhibition game against a team of former Notre Dame stars including the famous &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;. The game was played at Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park, which was within the protected territory of the Frankford Yellow Jackets, who were playing a league game just a few miles away at Legion Field. On three occasions prior to the game, Carr reportedly warned the Pottsville management not to play the game, &quot;under all penalties that the league could inflict&quot;. Ignoring Carr&#x27;s warnings, the game went on as scheduled. However, the Maroons stated that Carr knew of the game and had allowed it to take place. For this act, the Pottsville Maroons were fined $500 and had their franchise forfeited; as a result, the team was stripped of their NFL title, which was given to the Chicago Cardinals. However Carr&#x27;s decision and handling of the situation is still being protested by many sports historians, as well as by the people of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and controversy still lingers about who actually won the 1925 NFL Championship, since the Maroons had earlier beaten Chicago and were actually awarded the league championship before they were suspended.

==American Basketball League==
In 1925, Carr was one of the moving forces behind the formation of the American Basketball League (ABL), the first attempt to create a major professional basketball league in the United States. At the ABL&#x27;s organizational meeting, held in Cleveland in April 1925, Carr was elected as the ABL&#x27;s president and secretary. In three years as the league&#x27;s president, he helped establish clubs in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Rochester, Cleveland, Fort Wayne and Chicago, and negotiated with the operators of the Philadelphia Arena and Madison Square Garden to install professional basketball teams in those facilities.

==Minor League Baseball==
Carr returned to professional baseball in 1926 as president of the Columbus Senators, a minor league club playing in the American Association. He remained president of the Senators until early 1931, when the club was sold to the St. Louis Cardinals, and Carr was replaced by future National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Larry MacPhail.

In January 1933, Carr was hired as the promotional director for the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body for Minor League Baseball. He was also given a seat on the organization&#x27;s executive committee and charged with developing &quot;a program to rehabilitate minor league baseball.&quot; In 1931, prior to Carr taking over, there were 12 minor leagues, and many of them were in serious financial trouble. By 1939, Carr had overseen the expansion of Minor League Baseball to 40 leagues operating in 279 cities in 40 states employing 4,200 players and drawing an attendance in 1938 totaling 15,500,000.

==Family and later years==
Carr married Josephine Marie Sullivan on June 27, 1911, at St. Dominic&#x27;s Church in Columbus, Ohio. They had two children, Mary Agnes, (born October 13, 1913) and Joseph Francis Jr. (born October 1, 1915).

In February 1939, Carr was unanimously reelected as president of the NFL, this time for a 10-year term. Carr reported at the time that the NFL attendance in 1938 had increased by 14% to 937,167 in 25 league games. Three months after his reelection, on May 20, 1939, Carr suffered a heart attack and was taken to a Columbus hospital where he died several hours later. Carr had a prior heart attack in September 1937, resulting in a hospitalization lasting several weeks.

Carr&#x27;s funeral was held at the Holy Rosary Church in Columbus and was attended by leaders of the NFL. Carr was buried at St. Joseph Cemetery, located approximately 10 miles south of Columbus in Lockbourne, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Following Carr&#x27;s death, Chicago Bears owner George Halas paid tribute to Carr&#x27;s steadying influence and said:

Professional football&#x27;s remarkable growth and popularity today is not the result of the efforts of any one owner or group of owners. It is due entirely to Mr. Carr&#x27;s fair and impartial administration of its affairs and his steadfast belief in the game.

In June 1939, Halas proposed that the NFL&#x27;s most valuable player award, which had been approved by the league&#x27;s directors at their annual winter meeting, be named the Joe F. Carr Memorial Trophy. Halas&#x27; proposal was adopted by the NFL the following month.

The NFL Most Valuable Player Award was named for Carr starting in 1939 and continuing through the 1946 season, after which it was discontinued. The Touchdown Club of Columbus also presented a Joe F. Carr Trophy to the NFL Player of the Year annually from 1955 to 1978.

In 1950, the Helms Athletic Foundation established the Paul H. Helms Pro Football Hall of Fame (not to be confused with the Pro Football Hall of Fame established in 1962). Carr was one of the inaugural inductees into the Helms Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In July 1962, a board was established to select up to 20 individuals as the inaugural inductees into the newly established Pro Football Hall of Fame. The sport editor of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; at the time predicted: &quot;Its first choice could well be Joe Carr, the little man from Columbus, O., whose retiring nature was matched by his fiery belief in the future of professional football. Mr. Carr was the NFL&#x27;s first president, a position he held until his death, and much of the league&#x27;s success can be traced back to the solid foundation he laid.&quot;

In January 1963, the inaugural group of inductees was announced with Carr being one of &quot;the first 17 immortals&quot; to be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was one of six officials selected &quot;for helping to guide the pro sport from its original role as a stepchild of the college game to its modern popularity&quot;. He was described in a biographical portrait released by the Hall as the &quot;Father of Professional Football&quot; for his organizational work in the early days of professional football. Other inaugural inductees included George Halas, Red Grange, Jim Thorpe, Bronko Nagurski, Curly Lambeau, and Bert Bell.

In 1979, George Halas wrote that professional football in its infancy needed a man who could direct the development of our organization, help design rules and enforce them.&quot; In Halas&#x27; view, Carr was that man: &quot;He was a born organizer.&quot;

In 2010, football historian Chris Willis published a biography of Carr titled, &quot;The Man Who Built the National Football League: Joe F. Carr&quot;.

<doc id="763046" wikidata="Q61351" url="?curid=763046" title="Frederica of Hanover">
<text>Frederica of Hanover (&quot;Friederike Luise&quot;; , : &quot;Freideríki Luísa&quot;; 18 April 1917 – 6 February 1981) was Queen of Greece from 1 April 1947 until 6 March 1964 as the wife of King Paul and the Queen Mother of Greece from 6 March 1964, when her son Constantine II became King, until 8 December 1974, when the monarchy was officially abolished after a referendum.

Granddaughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II and daughter of Duke Ernest Augustus of Brunswick, Frederica was born a few months before the fall of the German Empire. Her family overthrown, she grew up between Austria and Weimar Germany, where her father owned large properties. As a teenager, she joined the Hitler Youth in 1933, before leaving to complete her studies for the next two years in the United Kingdom and then Italy. In Florence, she was received by Princess Helena of Greece, at whose house she met the Crown Prince of Greece, Paul. The two fell in love and married two years after the restoration of the monarchy in Greece. In the years that followed, she gave birth to three children, Sophie in 1938, Constantine in 1940 and Irene in 1942.

During the Second World War, Greece was occupied by the Axis powers. The Greek royal family left the country and Frederica and her children settled first in South Africa and from 1943 in Egypt. 
The changing political situation in Greece, with the rise of the EAM and the KKE, challenged the institution of the monarchy. The royal family did not return to the country until 1946, when the Greeks ratified the return and restoration of the institution in a referendum. In the period of civil war that followed, Frederica developed a strong social activity to support the efforts of the government and the Crown. She organised a network to help refugees affected by the forces of the Democratic Army, creating the so-called &quot;children&#x27;s towns&quot;, an initiative that was widely criticised by opponents of the Crown.

After the death of Paul I in 1964, the dowager queen retired from public life. However, according to the prevailing historiographical view, she continued to influence the fate of the country through her son, now King Constantine II. Frederica was widely regarded as Constantine&#x27;s éminence grise and continued to be attacked by the opposition, who blamed her for the tensions between the palace and the government of George Papandreou (1964–1965).

==Early life==
Born &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Friederike Luise, Princess of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, and Princess of Brunswick-Lüneburg on 18 April 1917 in Blankenburg am Harz, in the German Duchy of Brunswick, she was the only daughter and third child of Ernest Augustus, then reigning Duke of Brunswick, and his wife Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia, herself the only daughter of the German Emperor Wilhelm II. Both her father and maternal grandfather abdicated their thrones in November 1918 following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, while her paternal grandfather had been stripped of his British royal dukedom the previous year.

In 1933 Frederica joined the Jungmädelbund, the Nazi organisation for girls aged 10–14. Although it is not entirely clear whether this was of her own volition or not, in her autobiography, &quot;Measure of Understanding&quot;, she states: &quot;One day two women in uniform appeared in my parents&#x27; room and my parents told me to come out. It had become a law that all children had to register with the Nazi Youth Movement and the women had come to remind my parents of this duty.(...)I didn&#x27;t like wearing the uniform, and I never liked it later, but I saw it as something that had finally brought me into contact with other children. (...) 
My father didn&#x27;t like the Nazi movement, but he couldn&#x27;t discuss it openly. After two weeks in the youth movement I had a long private talk with my father. He explained to me what the whole uniform thing really meant, and we decided together that it would be better for me to cut all ties with it. But since I was in Germany, that would have been impossible under the law. So I was sent to England.&quot; 
In 1934, Adolf Hitler, in his ambition to link the British and German royal houses, asked for Frederica&#x27;s parents to arrange for the marriage of their seventeen-year-old daughter to the Prince of Wales. In her memoirs, Frederica&#x27;s mother described that she and her husband were &quot;shattered&quot; and such a possibility &quot;had never entered our minds&quot;. Victoria Louise herself had once been considered as a potential bride for the very same person prior to her marriage. Moreover, the age difference was too great (the Prince of Wales was twenty-three years Frederica&#x27;s senior), and her parents were unwilling to &quot;put any such pressure&quot; on their daughter.

To her family, she was known as &quot;Freddie&quot;.

==Marriage==
Prince Paul of Greece proposed to her during the summer of 1936, while he was in Berlin attending the 1936 Summer Olympics. Paul was a son of King Constantine I and Frederica&#x27;s great aunt Sophia. Accordingly, they were maternal first cousins once removed. They were also paternal second cousins as great-grandchildren of Christian IX of Denmark. Their engagement was announced officially on 28 September 1937, and Britain&#x27;s King George VI gave his consent pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act 1772 on 26 December 1937. They married in Athens on 9 January 1938. Frederica became Hereditary Princess of Greece, her husband being heir presumptive to his childless elder brother, King George II.

During the early part of their marriage, they resided at a villa in Psychiko in the suburbs of Athens. Ten months after their marriage, their first child, the future Queen Sofía of Spain (and future mother of Felipe VI), was born on 2 November 1938. On 2 June 1940, Frederica gave birth to the future King Constantine II.

According to several accounts, she had an affair with CIA director, Allen Dulles, after meeting him in 1958.

==War and exile==
At the peak of World War II, in April 1941, the Greek royal family was evacuated to Crete in a Sunderland flying boat. Shortly afterwards, the German forces attacked Crete. Frederica and her family were evacuated again, setting up a government-in-exile office in London.

In exile, King George II and the rest of the Greek royal family settled in South Africa. Here Frederica&#x27;s last child, Princess Irene, was born on 11 May 1942. The South African leader, General Jan Smuts, served as her godfather. The family eventually settled in Egypt in February 1944.

After the war, the 1946 Greek referendum restored King George to the throne. The Hereditary Prince and Princess returned to their villa in Psychiko.

==Queen consort==
On 1 April 1947, George II died and Frederica&#x27;s husband ascended the throne as Paul I, with Frederica as queen consort. A Communist insurgency in Northern Greece led to the Greek Civil War. The King and Queen toured Northern Greece under tight security to appeal for loyalty in the summer of 1947.

Queen Frederica was constantly attacked for her German ancestry. Left-wing politicians in Greece repeatedly used the fact that the Kaiser was her grandfather, and that she had brothers who were members of the SS, as propaganda against her. She was also criticized variously as &quot;very Prussian&quot; and &quot;was a Nazi&quot;. When she was in London representing her sick husband at the wedding of his first cousin Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark to King George VI&#x27;s elder daughter Princess Elizabeth in November 1947, Winston Churchill remarked on the Kaiser being her grandfather. Queen Frederica had replied acknowledging the fact, but reminding him that she was also descended from Queen Victoria, and that her father would be the British king if the country had operated under Salic Law (allowing only males to inherit the crown).


During the civil war, Queen Frederica set the Queen&#x27;s Camps or Child Cities (translation of: Παιδο(υ)πόλεις / &quot;Paidopoleis&quot; or &quot;Paidupoleis&quot;) a network of 53 camps around Greece where she would rescue children of members of DSE and former partisans.

The Greek Civil War ended in August 1949. The King and Queen took this opportunity to strengthen the monarchy, and paid official visits to Marshal Josip Broz Tito in Belgrade, Presidents Luigi Einaudi of Italy in Rome, Theodor Heuss of West Germany, and Bechara El Khoury of Lebanon, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, Governor-General Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari of India, King George VI of the United Kingdom, and the United States as guest of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. However, at home in Greece and abroad in the United Kingdom, Queen Frederica was targeted by the opposition, because as a girl she had belonged to the &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; (League of German Girls), a branch of the Hitler Youth group for young women; her supporters argued that evading membership in the group would be difficult under the existing political climate in Nazi Germany at the time.

Unlike her meek husband, in post-War Greece Frederica was one of the most hated public figures. This was due to a string of reasons that included her political interference, her intemperate character, her German ethnicity, and the fact she became identified in the public consciousness with all that was reactionary. Frederica has been described as &quot;inherently undemocratic&quot;. She was notorious for her numerous arbitrary and unconstitutional interventions in Greek politics and clashes with democratically elected governments. She actively politicked against the election of Alexander Papagos. At home in Greece and abroad in the United Kingdom, she was targeted by the opposition. In 1963 while visiting London, rioting by Greek leftists demonstrating against the situation with the political prisoners of the Greek Civil War, forced her to temporarily seek refuge in a stranger&#x27;s house. Her political interference was harshly criticized and was a significant factor in the strengthening of republican sentiments.

Frederica&#x27;s 16 November 1953 appearance in &quot;Life&quot; as America&#x27;s guest was taken on one of the many state visits she paid around the world. Also that year she appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. On 14 May 1962, her eldest daughter Sofía married Prince Juan Carlos of Spain (later King Juan Carlos I of Spain) in Athens.

==Queen dowager==
On 6 March 1964, King Paul died of cancer. When her son, King Constantine II, married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark later that year on 18 September, Queen Frederica stepped back from the majority of her public duties in favor of her daughter-in-law. She remained a figure of controversy and was accused in the press of being the &quot;éminence grise&quot; behind the throne.

She retired to the countryside where she lived an almost reclusive life. However, she continued to attend royal events that were family-oriented, such as the baptisms of her grandchildren in both Spain and Greece.

==Exile==
 King Constantine II&#x27;s clashes with the democratically elected Prime Minister George Papandreou Sr. were blamed by critics for causing the destabilisation that led to a military coup on 21 April 1967 and the rise of the regime of the colonels. Faced with a difficult situation, King Constantine initially collaborated with the military dictatorship, swearing in their government under a royalist prime minister. Later that year he attempted a counter-coup in an attempt to restore democracy, whose failure forced him into exile. Following this, the junta appointed a regent to carry out the tasks of the exiled monarch.

In 1971, Frederica published an autobiography, &quot;A Measure of Understanding&quot;.

On 1 June 1973 the junta abolished the Greek monarchy without consulting the Greek people and then attempted to legitimize its actions through a 1973 plebiscite that was widely suspected of being rigged. The head of the junta became the new head-of-state as President of Greece George Papadopoulos.

The dictatorship ended on 24 July 1974 and the pre-junta constitutional monarchy was never restored. A plebiscite was held on 8 December 1974 in which Constantine (who was able to campaign only from outside the country) freely admitted past errors, and promised to support democracy. However, 69% of Greeks freely voted to make Greece a democratic republic.

==Death==
Frederica died on 6 February 1981 in exile in Madrid of heart failure, reportedly following eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), although a biographer has claimed the surgery was cataract removal.

She was interred at Tatoi (the royal family&#x27;s palace and burial ground in Greece). Her son and his family were allowed to attend the service but had to leave immediately afterwards.

<doc id="763049" wikidata="Q1760347" url="?curid=763049" title="WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure">
<text>WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (WAPI) is a Chinese National Standard for Wireless LANs (GB 15629.11-2003).
Although it was allegedly designed to operate on top of Wi-Fi, compatibility with the security protocol used by the 802.11 wireless networking standard developed by the IEEE is in dispute. Due to the limited access of the standard (only eleven Chinese companies had access), it was the focus of a U.S.–China trade dispute. Following this it was submitted to, and rejected by the ISO. It was resubmitted to ISO in 2010, but was cancelled as a project on 21 November 2011 after being withdrawn by China.

==How the standard works==
WAPI, which was initiated to resolve the existing security loopholes (WEP) in WLAN international standard (ISO/IEC 8802-11), was issued to be Chinese national standard in 2003. WAPI works by having a central Authentication Service Unit (ASU) which is known to both the wireless user and the access point and which acts as a central authority verifying both.
The WAPI standard (draft JTC1/SC6 N14619) allows selection of the symmetric encryption algorithm, either AES or SMS4, which has been declassified in January 2006 and passed evaluation by independent experts.

==History==

===US–China trade dispute===
In late 2003, the Chinese government announced a policy requiring that wireless devices sold in China include WAPI support and foreign companies wanting access to the Chinese market could produce WAPI-compliant products independently or partner with one of 11 Chinese firms to which the standard was disclosed. This issue became a point of trade discussions between the then United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and his Chinese government equivalent. China agreed to indefinitely postpone implementation of the policy.

===ISO rejection===
The Chinese Standards Association (SAC: Standardization Administration of the People&#x27;s Republic of China) subsequently submitted WAPI (ISO/IEC JTC1 N7904) to the ISO standards organization for recognition as an international standard, at about the same time as the IEEE 802.11i standard. After much debate related to both process issues and technical issues, the IEC/ISO Secretaries General decided to send the proposals to parallel fast track ballots. In March 2006, the 802.11i proposal was approved and the WAPI proposal was rejected. This result was confirmed at a Ballot Resolution meeting held in June 2006.

The result was subject to two appeals by SAC to the ISO/IEC Secretaries General that alleged &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;amoral&quot; behavior during the balloting process and irregularities during the ballot resolution process. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua said on May 29, 2006, that appeals were filed in April and May 2006 and, the agency said, alleged that the IEEE was involved in &quot;organizing a conspiracy against the China-developed WAPI, insulting China and other national bodies, and intimidation and threats.&quot; Xinhua did not make these allegations specific. In July 2006, 802.11i was published as an ISO/IEC standard. WAPI is no longer being considered by ISO/IEC and all appeals have been dismissed.

After the preliminary results were announced in March 2006, various press reports from China suggested that WAPI may still be mandated in China. TBT (Technical Barrier to Trade) declarations to the WTO in January 2006 and a statement in June 2006 to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6, in which SAC said they would not respect the status of 802.11i as an international standard, seemed to support this possibility. However, as of early 2007, the only official Chinese policy related to WAPI is a &quot;government preference&quot; for WAPI in government and government-funded systems. It is unclear how strongly this preference has been enforced, and it seems to have had little effect on the non-government market.

===ISO resubmission===

In 2009, the China NB was encouraged by SC6 to resubmit WAPI to SC6. It was allocated the standard number ISO/IEC 20011 after passing the first stage of balloting. Positive votes and commitments to participate in the standardisation process were received from China, Korea, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Kenya. Negative votes were received from the US and the UK. The US and the IEEE 802.11 Working Group provided numerous detailed comments rebutting the case for standardisation made by the China NB in the New Project proposal.

The required comment resolution on the ballot only started in June 2011, with the US, UK, China, Korea and Switzerland NBs and the IEEE 802.11 Working Group all participating. The Swiss NB representative admitted during the process that he was a paid consultant to IWNCOMM, the Chinese source of the WAPI technology. The Kenya and Czech NBs did not participate in the comment resolution process or in any other discussions related to WAPI after the close of the ballot in early 2010.

The comment resolution process failed after agreement could not be established on a variety of fundamental issues. For example, the China NB continued to insist that WAPI was justified because 802.11 included WEP, which is known to be broken. On the other side, the US NB and the IEEE 802.11 NB noted that WEP-based security had been deprecated in favour of WPA2-based security in IEEE 802.11-2007, and that no one had ever alleged any issues with WPA2-based security. In addition, the IEEE 802.11 WG noted that the functionality offered by WAPI systems was equivalent to only a small subset of the security offered by WPA2-based systems.

The China NB eventually withdrew WAPI in October 2011 (document JTC1/SC6 N15030) and the project was formally cancelled by SC6 in February 2012. The reasons for the withdrawal are unclear. The Chinese proponents of WAPI from IWNCOMM were clearly very unhappy when the withdrawal was announced. It has been speculated that Chinese government authorities ordered the withdrawal on the basis that WAPI had failed to be standardised by ISO/IEC after eight years. In addition, despite mandates for WAPI to be implemented in China in Wi-Fi enabled mobile phones and by the three Chinese service providers, it is very rarely used in practice.

==Chinese cell phone usage==
Mobile phones in China are controlled by MIIT. The &quot;indefinite postponing&quot; of the WAPI requirement in 2003 caused the MIIT to stop the certification of any phones with Wi-Fi capability. In 2009, a requirement for Chinese phones to support WAPI if there is any WLAN capability was made, effectively un-banning WLAN hardware from Chinese phones. One of the sticking points behind the iPhone in China was the support of WiFi without the WAPI standard. In the end, it was released without any WLAN at all.

According to China&#x27;s State Radio Monitoring Center Chinese, in April 2011 regulators approved the frequency ranges used by a new Apple mobile phone with 3G and wireless LAN support including WAPI. Dell Inc&#x27;s Mini 3 phones have also received network access licenses for China.

The Chinese government&#x27;s preference for the WAPI standard in some respects is similar to their preference for the TD-SCDMA for their 3G network.

<doc id="763052" wikidata="Q5224707" url="?curid=763052" title="Darrell Russell (dragster driver)">
<text>Darrell James Russell (September 20, 1968 – June 27, 2004) was an American National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) drag racer. He was the 2001 NHRA Rookie Of The Year. At the time, he was the third driver to win in his Professional class debut.

Before becoming a driver in NHRA&#x27;s Professional class of Top Fuel Dragster, he competed for several years in NHRA&#x27;s Sportsman (amateur) class of Top Alcohol Dragster, a slower version of Top Fuel. In four seasons of competition driving Joe Amato&#x27;s NHRA Top Fuel Dragster, he compiled a record of 106 round wins versus 75 losses. He won six events and was runner-up at 11 others, out of 81 events entered.

== Death ==
In 2004 at the NHRA Sears Craftsman Nationals at Gateway International Raceway in Madison, Illinois, near St. Louis, he was competing in the second round of eliminations against Scott Kalitta when his dragster went out of control and crashed just past the finish line. When the NHRA safety team got to Russell, he was unconscious, but breathing. Russell was extracted from his dragster by NHRA emergency services officials and transported by air to the St. Louis Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. His dragster broke up after he crossed the finish line. One of the rear Goodyear tires blew out, damaging the back part of the race car. Shrapnel caused by the exploding tire entered the driver&#x27;s cockpit from the rear, fatally injuring Russell. Flying debris from the explosion killed him, not the impact from the crash.

He died of severe head injuries, even though he was wearing an approved racing helmet. Russell was the first racer to be killed at an NHRA national event since Blaine Johnson, in 1996. Gateway named one of its grandstands &quot;The Darrell Russell Stand&quot; in his memory.

He was interred in the Klein Cemetery in Pinehurst, Texas in Montgomery County. Over 2,000 people attended his funeral.

== Aftermath ==
After Russell&#x27;s death, Goodyear quickly designed and released an improved version of their top fuel tire, and the NHRA required that all top fuel cars switch to the new tire for the race immediately following the Gateway event. The new tires are a harder compound, which improves puncture resistance and also causes the tires to expand less, improving safety. The NHRA also reduced the maximum nitromethane content of the fuel from 90% to 85% to reduce power, changed the maximum primary rear wing element angle to 2 degrees positive (measured when the dragster is at rest) to reduce downforce, and required that top fuel cars install a 2 mm (0.090 inch) thick titanium shield behind the driver&#x27;s head to block shrapnel from reaching the driver. They also required that rear tires have no less than the minimum manufacturer recommended tire pressure, which is 7 psi (48 kPa). To enforce this, Goodyear officials check, and if needed, adjust rear tire pressures at the starting line to meet the 7 psi minimum requirement.

<doc id="763054" wikidata="Q6880030" url="?curid=763054" title="Mistaken Identity (Kim Carnes album)">
<text>Mistaken Identity is the sixth studio album by American singer Kim Carnes, released in April 1981 by EMI America Records. The album spent four weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was subsequently certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for nine non-consecutive weeks and topped the Hot 100 year-end chart of 1981. Follow-up singles &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot; and &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; reached numbers 28 and 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively.

&quot;Record World&quot; said of the title track that &quot;Dreamy sax/keyboard colors provide the backdrop for [Carnes&#x27;] vocal longing.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The album&#x27;s supporting tour, titled the Mistaken Identity Summer Tour &#x27;81, ran from August to October 1981, split into two legs. The first leg began in Dallas, Texas, on August 16. It was Carnes&#x27; first time headlining a tour. Gary U.S. Bonds was the support act.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; became Carnes&#x27; best-selling album, and her first to chart within the US Top 40. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at no. 66 in the week of May 2, 1981, and climbed to No. 1 in its ninth week. It spent a total of four weeks at the top of the chart, selling 1 million copies and earning Platinum certification. The album&#x27;s success was buoyed by its lead single &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, which spent nine non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 between May and July 1981. Subsequent singles &quot;Draw of the Cards&quot; and &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; peaked at No. 28 and No. 60, respectively.
