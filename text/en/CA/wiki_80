<text>Central Finland (; ) is a region ( / ) in Finland. It borders the regions of Päijät-Häme, Pirkanmaa, South Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia, North Ostrobothnia, North Savo, and South Savo. The city of Jyväskylä is the regional centre and by far the largest city in the area. The Central Finland lies slightly south of the geographical centre of Finland. The landscape is hilly and a large part of the province belongs to the Finnish Lakeland.

The largest lake in the very water-based region is Lake Päijänne (1,080 km2). Other large lakes are Lake Keitele (490 km2), Lake Konnevesi (190 km2) and Lake Kivijärvi (150 km2). The highest point in the region is Kiiskilänmäki in the municipality of Multia, which reaches an altitude of 269 meters above sea level. Kuokanjoki, Finland&#x27;s shortest river and one of the world&#x27;s shortest rivers is in the region.

Central Finland has been one of the slowly growing regions in terms of population, but the growth has been based on the Jyväskylä sub-region&#x27;s position as a significant growth center, and most of the region&#x27;s municipalities are declining in population. Also, of these, Kyyjärvi has landed on the Finnish state&#x27;s crisis financial management list due to its economic hardship. Luhanka, the smallest municipality in the whole Mainland Finland in terms of population, is also located in the region.

The western capercaillie (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;) is the regional bird of Central Finland that is also depicted in the coat of arms.

== History ==

The idea of a province of Central Finland was born at the end of the 19th century. The concept was developed by the district doctor Wolmar Schildt, whose article for &quot;Suometar&quot; first appeared in 1856. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the provincial identity of Central Finland was strengthened by associations, organisations and companies that expanded into the provinces. The Central Finland Province was established in 1960, but was abolished in the county reform of 1997.

A province is a common administrative unit based on the autonomous decision-making power of municipalities and embodies local democracy at the regional level vis-à-vis the state, while a county is a regional administrative unit of the state. The Central Finland covers almost the same geographical area as the former Central Finland Province. At that time, the province of Central Finland was merged with the provinces of Turku and Pori and Vaasa and the northern parts of Tavastia to form the Western Finland Province. The current Central Finland is larger than the former province of Central Finland, as Jämsä was joined with Kuorevesi and part of Längelmäki, which previously belonged to Pirkanmaa. Kuhmoinen was also part of Central Finland until 2021, when it joined the region of Pirkanmaa.

<doc id="782662" wikidata="Q1272388" url="?curid=782662" title="Bereavement Support Payment">
<text>In the United Kingdom, Bereavement Support Payments (also known as bereavement benefits) are paid to the husband/wife or partner of a person who has died in the previous 21 months. It replaced Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance in April 2017, which had previously replaced Widow&#x27;s benefit in April 2001.

It is a social security benefit that is designed to support people who have recently lost their spouse, and need some financial support to help them get back on their feet. A similar benefit is provided in Malta in accordance to the &quot;Widows and Orphans Pension Act&quot; of 1927.

The qualifying conditions are as follows:

* the deceased partner must have paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since 6 April 1975.

Bereavement Support Payment consists of 2 parts, firstly:

*a bereavement payment of £3,500 which is a one off tax free lump sum, provided the claimant was receiving Child Benefit; otherwise the payment is £2,500

::::(formerly only payable if the deceased spouse met the National Insurance contribution conditions, and was not receiving a Category A State pension).

Secondly:

*the succeeding benefit:

# a standard rate (equivalent to the former Bereavement allowance), which is payable to surviving partners without children. This runs for up to 18 months from the date of claim or until the claimant reaches retirement age (whichever is sooner).
# a higher rate (equivalent to the former Widowed parent&#x27;s allowance). This is payable to surviving partners who have dependent children for whom they are in receipt of child benefit. This allowance is payable for up to 18 months from the date of claim.

None of these benefits are payable if the claimant is over state pension age. However, remarriage no longer affects any claim in payment. A person can move from the standard to the higher rate if they begin receiving Child Benefit after the claim has been made.

Bereavement Support Payment does not affect other benefits for a year after the first payment. After a year, remaining money left from the first payment can affect claims for other means-tested benefits.

<text>Zhaoqing (), alternately romanized as Shiuhing, is a prefecture-level city in Guangdong Province, China. As of the 2020 census, its population was 4,113,594, with 1,553,109 living in the built-up (or metro) area made of Duanzhou, Dinghu and Gaoyao. The prefectural seat—except the Seven Star Crags—is fairly flat, but thickly forested mountains lie just outside its limits. Numerous rice paddies and aquaculture ponds are found on the outskirts of the city. Sihui and the southern districts of the prefecture are considered part of the Pearl River Delta.

Formerly one of the most important cities in southern China, Zhaoqing lost its importance during the Qing dynasty and is now primarily known for tourism and as a provincial &quot;college town&quot;. Residents from Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and the other cities of the Pearl River Delta often visit it for weekend excursions. It is also a growing manufacturing center.

==Name==
Zhaoqing was known to the Qin as Sihui（四会） and Han as Gaoyao (高要). It was renamed Duanzhou (端州) from its role as the seat of Duan Prefecture under the Sui. The present name, meaning &quot;Beginning Auspiciousness&quot;, was bestowed on the area by Emperor Huizong of the Song in 1118. &quot;Zhaoqing&quot; is the pinyin romanization; the earlier Postal Map form &quot;Shiuhing&quot; derives from the name&#x27;s Cantonese pronunciation.

==History==

Gaoyao was located on the south bank of the Xi River, named for its district&#x27;s principal feature: the river&#x27;s Lingyang Gorge (then known as &quot;Gaoyao&quot;). In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the administration was relocated to Duanzhou on the opposite bank of the river, which became an important administrative and military center of the southern Sui Empire.

The was built in Duanzhou during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song (1022–1063).

When the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Zhaoqing was still an important center, serving as the seat of the Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi). Matteo Ricci&#x27;s &quot;On the Christian Expedition among the Sinae&quot; tells of the early visits of Macanese-based Europeans to Zhaoqing. The Viceroy Chen Rui () summoned Macao&#x27;s mayor and bishop in the early 1580s, but the town sent its auditor Mattia Penella and the Italian Jesuit Michele Ruggieri in their place in 1582. After several false starts, Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci were allowed to establish their residence in the city, the first Jesuit mission house on mainland China, after Zhaoqing&#x27;s governor Wang Pan learned of Ricci&#x27;s skill as a mathematician and cartographer. Ricci drew the first modern Chinese map of the world in Zhaoqing in 1584. Ruggieri left for Rome in 1588 but Ricci remained until the next year, when a new viceroy expelled him from the city and obliged the Jesuits to relocate to Shaozhou (now Shaoguan).

During the Fall of the Ming in the mid-17th century, Zhaoqing served as the capital of the Prince of Gui&#x27;s Southern Ming resistance, with the prince styling himself the Yongli Emperor. The town fell in 1650 and the prince relocated to Guilin and then various locations in Guangxi, Yunnan, and Burma. The Jesuits Andreas Wolfgang Koffler and, later, Michał Boym stayed for some time at his court.

<doc id="782670" wikidata="Q5702" url="?curid=782670" title="Ostrobothnia (region)">
<text>Ostrobothnia (; ) is a region in western Finland. It borders the regions of Central Ostrobothnia, South Ostrobothnia, and Satakunta. It is one of six regions considered historical Ostrobothnia, hence it is also referred to as Coastal Ostrobothnia to avoid confusion.

Ostrobothnia is one of two Finnish regions with a Swedish-speaking majority (the other being the constitutionally monolingual province of Åland); Swedish-speakers make up 51.2% of the total population. The region contains thirteen bilingual municipalities and one that is exclusively Finnish-speaking. The capital of Vaasa is predominantly inhabited by Finnish speakers, whereas smaller towns and rural areas are generally dominated by the Swedish language. The three municipalities with the largest number of Swedish speakers are Korsholm, Jakobstad and Pedersöre.

Geographically, Ostrobothnia has little topographical relief, because it is mostly former seafloor brought to surface by post-glacial rebound and the accumulation of alluvial sediment. Ostrobothnia has both vast expanses of cultivated fields (&quot;lakeus&quot;) as in Southern Ostrobothnia, and the archipelago of Kvarken (Finnish: &quot;Merenkurkku&quot;). Glacial transport has deposited large quantities of rocks in the area. Like elsewhere in Ostrobothnia, rivers are a prominent part of the landscape. The major rivers that discharge into the Gulf of Bothnia in Ostrobothnia are Kyrönjoki, Lapuanjoki and Ähtävänjoki.

Kaskinen, a coastal town located in the southern part of the region, is the smallest town in Finland in terms of both area and population.

== Name and symbols ==
Prior to the officialization of the names of the Finnish regions, Ostrobothnia was also known as &quot;Vasa kustregionen&quot; in Swedish and &quot;Vaasan rannikkoseutu&quot; in Finnish, both of which translate into &quot;[the] coastal region of Vaasa&quot;. The Institute for the Languages of Finland recommended that the region be named &quot;Kustösterbotten&quot; in Swedish and &quot;Rannikko-Pohjanmaa&quot; in Finnish, meaning &quot;coastal Ostrobothnia&quot; in English. However, upon the confirmation of the names of the Finnish regions on 26 February 1998, the current name of the region was officialized instead, according to the wishes of the regional government. The central government cited the Swedish language&#x27;s prevalence in the region, as well as the lack of a common consensus on an alternative name the reasons for its decision. In local circles or communities, Ostrobothnia is often referred to as &quot;Pampas&quot;. The word derives from the similarities in the flat landscape with the Pampas area in South America.

The regional tree is the black alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;), the regional mammal is the common elk (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), the regional stone is Vaasa granite and the regional song is &quot;The march of Vaasa&quot; (, ).

=== Coat of arms ===
Gules, a sheaf Or; on chief countercharged four ermines 2+2 courant.

The sprouting wheatsheaf is a symbol of the Royal House of Vasa; a Vasa king established the city of Vaasa, the capital of the region. The running stoats are a symbol of Ostrobothnia.

== Municipalities ==
The region of Ostrobothnia consists of 14 municipalities, 6 of which have city status (marked in bold).

==Climate==
Ostrobothnia is located in the borderlands between the humid continental and subarctic climates (Köppen &quot;Dfb/Dfc&quot;). Its winters are moderated by prevailing westerly winds from the mild North Atlantic Current travelling across Norway, Sweden and the Bay of Bothnia. Although the sea tends to easily freeze over in winter during prolonged spells of cold weather due to the low salinity, winters seldom get severely cold.

In general during latter decades, the southern Bothnia Bay coastlines of central Norrland in Sweden across the strait and Ostrobothnia mostly range from slightly above average highs in summer to about highs and lows in winter. Due to the vastness of the region from north to south, this will vary by a bit from one place to another depending on latitude.

Precipitation is quite variable but is enough to build up a reliable snowpack all through the region during winter months. In summer, Ostrobothnia experiences perpetual civil twilight due to its high latitude with the sun angle never falling below -3° at summer solstice in Vaasa and -2° in Jakobstad. During that time of the year, daylight remains bright enough to permit daytime outdoor activities without artificial lighting especially under clear skies. As a result, days are short during winter although all areas of Ostrobothnia are far south of the Arctic Circle.

<text>A bird bath (or birdbath) is an artificial puddle or small shallow pond, created with a water-filled basin, in which birds may drink, bathe, and cool themselves. A bird bath can be a garden ornament, small reflecting pool, outdoor sculpture, and also can be a part of creating a vital wildlife garden.

== Description ==
A bird bath (or birdbath) is an artificial puddle or small shallow pond, created with a water-filled basin. Birds may use the bath to drink, bathe, and cool themselves. A bird bath is an attraction for many different species of birds to visit gardens, especially during the summer and drought periods. Bird baths that provide a reliable source of water year round add to the popularity and &quot;micro-habitat&quot; support.

Bird baths can be pre-made basins on pedestals and columns or hang from leaves and trees, or be carved out depressions in rocks and boulders. Requirements for a bird bath should include the following; a shallow gradually deepening basin; open surroundings to minimize cats&#x27; stalking; clean and renewed-refilled water; and cleaning to avoid contamination and mosquitoes. Two inches of water in the center is sufficient for most backyard birds, because they do not submerge their bodies, only dipping their wings to splash water on their backs. Deeper or wide basins can have &quot;perch islands&quot; in the water, which can also help discourage feline predators. Elevation on a pedestal is a common safety measure, providing a clear area around the bird bath that is free of hiding locations for predators. A bird feeder can complement a bird bath to encourage birds to linger and return.

The early bird baths were simple depressions in the ground. The first purpose-built bird bath was developed by UK garden design company, Abrahm Pulman &amp; Sons in the 1830s.

== Design and construction ==

A bird bath can be a garden ornament, small reflecting pool, outdoor sculpture, and also can be a part of creating a vital wildlife garden. Bird baths can be made with materials, including molded concrete, glazed terra cotta, glass, metals (e.g., copper), plastics, mosaic tiles, marble, or any other material that can be outdoors and hold water. In natural landscape gardens rocks and boulders with natural or stonemason carved basins can fit in unobtrusively. Some bird baths use a recirculating pump as part of a fountain or water feature, and can include filters, a float valve-water connection for automatic refilling, or a drip irrigation emitter aimed into the bowl. Some use a solar powered pump, floating or submerged, to recirculate the water. Birds are attracted to the sight and sound of running water, with integrated or nearby fountains helpful elements to bring birds to the garden.

=== Ornaments and sculptures ===
The traditional bird bath is made of molded concrete or glazed terra cotta formed in two pieces: the bowl and the pedestal. The bowl has an indentation or socket in the base which allows it to fit on the pedestal. The pedestal is typically about one meter tall. Both bowl and pedestal can be clean or decorated with bas-relief. Bowls can be pure curved geometry, or have motifs of a shell or pseudo-rocky spring. The pedestal can also be a simple silhouette or incorporate decorations. Birds seem unconcerned with the aesthetics, with even a shallow plate, pie-tin, or puddle below a slowly dripping water outlet used.

===Baths for large birds===
Large birds, such as the Canada goose, also enjoy baths. They may be accommodated well by large agricultural sprinklers in a field of stubble. Providing such a place for migratory birds, especially in urban and suburban areas devoid of wetlands is an excellent way of encouraging them to frequent an area.

==Bird habitat==
===Perch and view needs===

Bird baths require a place for birds to perch. The bath should also be shallow enough to avoid the risk of birds drowning. A depth of 2” is right for most species. This requirement may be fulfilled by making the bowl shallow enough to allow birds to perch &quot;in&quot; the water. For deeper bowls, stones, gravel or rocks can be placed in the center to give birds a place to perch. Objects placed in the bird bath bowl should have a texture that makes it easy for birds&#x27; talons to hold. Birds lacking binocular vision have poor depth perception, and can find a bird bath off-putting if they are unable to judge the water&#x27;s depth. Leaning a stick or flat rock against the bird bath rim as a ramp to allow them gradual access into the water may allay their fear.

Consideration should also be made to the issue of house cats and other predators, by placing the bird bath in a location where birds can see the area around it, and where there are no hiding places for predators. Birds cannot fly well when their feathers are wet; two feet of open space on all sides of the bird bath allows birds to see danger coming with enough time to escape. If the bowl is too deep, some birds will be afraid to enter the bath, staying at the edge and using it for drinking water only, being unable to see beyond the edge if entering the water, or unwilling to enter water that is too deep for their safety.

===Plants===
Native plants, ornamental plants that supply berries, acorns, nuts, seeds, nectar, and other foods, and also bird nest building materials encourages the health and new generations of birds. These qualities can also increase the visible population to enjoy in a garden. Using companion planting and the birds&#x27; insect cuisine habits is a traditional method for pest control in an organic garden, and any landscape.

Taller shrubs and trees nearby allow short and safe &quot;commutes&quot; to the bird bath. The bird bath will attract more birds if placed where a frightened bird can fly up easily to an overhanging limb or resting place if disturbed or attacked.

==Maintenance==
A bird bath requires regular maintenance and fresh water. Fresh water and cleaning are important because of the possible adverse health effects of birds drinking dirty water, or water which may have become fouled with excrement, mosquito larvae, algae, or fungi.

Maintenance for some bird baths may be as simple as a wash and refill several times a week, but it will depend on the bird bath materials. There are a variety of methods and substances that can be used to clean a bird bath, including small quantities of bleach, oregano or olive oil, or commercially available, non-toxic cleaning products. Concrete bird baths tend to become mossy and, therefore, slippery—requiring an occasional scrubbing out with a stiff brush. Plastic or resin bird baths may need to be drained, wiped down with a towel, and refilled.

Mosquitoes and mosquito larvae are the most serious potential health risk that can be caused by poor bird bath maintenance. To prevent mosquito larvae, change the bird bath water weekly to interrupt their 7–10 day breeding cycle, or use a water aerator to break up the still water surface that mosquitoes require to lay eggs. Commercial products that contain bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), which is lethal to mosquitoes but non-toxic for humans and wildlife, can also be used to control mosquitoes.

<doc id="782683" wikidata="Q1383662" url="?curid=782683" title="Jean Raspail">
<text>Jean Raspail (, 5 July 1925 – 13 June 2020) was a French explorer, novelist, and travel writer. Many of his books are about historical figures, exploration and indigenous peoples. He was a recipient of the prestigious French literary awards Grand Prix du Roman and Grand Prix de littérature by the Académie française. The French government honoured him in 2003 by appointing him to the Legion of Honor, with the grade of Officer. Internationally, he is best known for his controversial 1973 novel &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot;, which is about mass third-world immigration to Europe.

==Life and career==
Born on 5 July 1925 in Chemillé-sur-Dême, Indre-et-Loire, Raspail was the son of factory manager Octave Raspail and Marguerite Chaix. He attended private Catholic school at Saint-Jean de Passy in Paris, the Institution Sainte-Marie d&#x27;Antony and the École des Roches in Verneuil-sur-Avre.

During the first twenty years of his career Raspail traveled the world. He led a Tierra del Fuego–Alaska car trek in 1950–52 and, in 1954, a French research expedition to the land of the Incas. In 1981, his novel &quot;Moi, Antoine de Tounens, roi de Patagonie&quot; (I, Antoine of Tounens, King of Patagonia) won the Grand Prix du Roman (award for a novel) of the Académie française.

His traditional Catholicism serves as an inspiration for many of his works, in which the utopias of communism and liberalism are shown to fail, and a Catholic monarchy is restored. In his 1990 novel &quot;Sire&quot; a French king is crowned in Reims in February 1999, the 18-year-old Philippe Pharamond de Bourbon, a direct descendant of the last French kings.

In his best known work, &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot; (1973), Raspail predicts the collapse of Western civilization from an overwhelming &quot;tidal wave&quot; of Third World immigration. The &quot;hordes&quot; of the world rise and, in the words of playwright Ian Allen, &quot;destroy the white race.&quot; The book has been translated into English, German, Spanish, Italian, Afrikaans, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Hungarian and Portuguese, and as of 2006 it had sold over 500,000 copies. After &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot; Raspail wrote other novels, including &quot;North&quot;, &quot;Sire&quot;, and &quot;The Fisher&#x27;s Ring&quot;. Raspail reiterated these views in a co-written 1985 article (&quot;Will France Still Be French in 2015?&quot;) for &quot;Le Figaro&quot; magazine, where he stated &quot;the proportion of France&#x27;s non-European immigrant population will grow to endanger the survival of traditional French culture, values and identity&quot;.

Raspail was a candidate for the French Academy in 2000, for which he received the most votes, yet did not obtain the majority required for election to the vacant seat of Jean Guitton.

An article by Raspail for &quot;Le Figaro&quot; on 17 June 2004, entitled &quot;The Fatherland Betrayed by the Republic&quot;, in which he criticized the French immigration policy, was sued by International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism on the grounds of &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot;, but the action was turned down by the court on 28 October.

In 1970, the Académie française awarded Raspail its Jean Walter Prize for the whole of his work. In 2007 he was awarded the Grande Médaille d’Or des Explorations et Voyages de Découverte by the Société de géographie of France for the whole of his work.

==Personal life==
He lived in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. He died in the on 13 June 2020, aged 94.

<text>Kymenlaakso (; ; &quot;Kymi/Kymmene Valley&quot;) is a region in Finland. It borders the regions of Uusimaa, Päijät-Häme, South Savo and South Karelia and Russia (Leningrad Oblast). Its name means literally &quot;The Valley of River Kymi&quot;. Kymijoki is one of the biggest rivers in Finland with a drainage basin with 11% of the area of Finland. The city of Kotka with 51,000 inhabitants is located at the delta of River Kymi and has the most important import harbour in Finland. Other cities are Kouvola further in the inland which has after a municipal merger 81,000 inhabitants and the old bastion town Hamina.

Kymenlaakso was one of the first industrialized regions of Finland. It became the most important region for paper and pulp industry in Finland. Since the late 1900s many plants have closed, which has caused some deindustrialization, unemployment and population decline in Kymenlaakso, especially in those communities that were built around plants in Kouvola.

== Historical provinces ==
&quot;For history, geography and culture see: Uusimaa, Karelia and Tavastia&quot;

== History ==

Kymenlaakso, cradled by the winding Kymi River, boasts a history as dynamic as its waterways. Unlike Finland&#x27;s traditional provinces, Kymenlaakso emerged as a distinct region much later, a testament to its ever-evolving character. The earliest whispers of human presence in Kymenlaakso echo back to the Stone Age. These settlements laid the foundation for later inhabitants like the Tavastians and Karelians, who etched their own stories onto the land.

For centuries, Kymenlaakso found itself under Swedish rule. Its strategic location transformed it into a vital trade corridor between Sweden and Russia. This era also witnessed the birth of its industrial prowess, with the 18th century ushering in an iron and steel boom. Sawmills and paper mills sprouted like mushrooms along the riverbanks, laying the groundwork for Kymenlaakso&#x27;s future industrial dominance.

The 19th century brought a shift in political winds as Kymenlaakso became part of the Grand Duchy of Finland in personal union with the Russian Empire. However, the region&#x27;s industrial spirit remained unfazed. In fact, this period saw further consolidation of its industrial base. The early 20th century witnessed another significant development – the rise of a powerful labor movement, a reflection of the growing importance of the working class in Kymenlaakso&#x27;s industrial landscape.

Following World War II, Kymenlaakso embraced its place in independent Finland. While industry remained the cornerstone of its economy, forestry and tourism began carving out niches for themselves. However, recent years haven&#x27;t been without challenges. The decline of the forest industry has cast a shadow over the region. Undeterred, Kymenlaakso is actively pursuing economic diversification, attracting new businesses and exploring new avenues for growth.

<doc id="782687" wikidata="Q1085970" url="?curid=782687" title="1919–20 NHL season">
<text>The 1919–20 NHL season was the third season of the National Hockey League (NHL). A Quebec team was activated by the NHL, increasing the number of teams to four. Following changes in its ownership, the Toronto NHL franchise adopted the Toronto St. Patricks name. The four teams played 24 games in a split-schedule format. The Ottawa Senators won the league championship by winning both halves of the split-season. The Senators went on to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since the Cup challenge era ended and their eighth time overall, by defeating the PCHA&#x27;s Seattle Metropolitans three games to two in a best-of-five series in the Stanley Cup Finals.
==League business==
The NHL approved the name change of Toronto&#x27;s franchise to Tecumsehs on December 6, 1919, a previous name of a Toronto franchise in the NHA. Several days later the franchise was transferred from the Arena to private investors, which named the club the Toronto St. Patricks. The group paid $5,000 to the NHL for the franchise.

Since the NHL had cancelled the previous Quebec franchise after Percy Quinn tried to use the franchise to resurrect the NHA, Quebec was without a franchise. By agreement with the NHL franchise&#x27;s previous owners, a new Quebec franchise was approved on December 16, 1919. Quebec, which did not ice teams in the first two seasons of the NHL, finally iced a team, although they were not successful.

==Arena changes==
* The Montreal Canadiens&#x27; home arena, Jubilee Rink, burned down during the off-season in April 1919, forcing the team to play on the road at the start of the 1919–20 season until Mount Royal Arena was completed in January 1920.
* The new Quebec Athletics team played their home games at Quebec Arena.

== Regular season ==
=== Highlights ===
The Montreal Canadiens had their home opener January 10 in brand new Mount Royal Arena and Newsy Lalonde used the occasion to celebrate with six goals in a 14–7 drubbing of the Toronto St. Patricks. The combined total of 21 goals by both teams set the NHL record.

Jack Darragh of Ottawa had a chance to play in goal when Toronto defeated Ottawa 5–3 on January 24. He took over when Clint Benedict was penalized. He did not surrender any goals during the two minutes.

Despite a dismal record of 2–10 in both halves of the season, the Quebec Athletics&#x27; Joe Malone scored seven goals in one game on January 31, 1920. , it is still the NHL record for most goals in one game. An eighth goal was disallowed on an off-side call. Malone was later quoted &quot;the thing I recall most vividly is that it was bitterly cold.&quot; He nearly equalled the record on March 10 when he scored six goals in a 10–4 win over the Ottawa Senators. Malone led the league in goals with 39. But by surrendering 7.18 goals against per game, a record that stands today, Quebec finished dead last.

With the war now over, players came home and fans were now coming in larger numbers to see games. On February 21, 1920, a record crowd of 8,500 fans came to see Ottawa play Toronto at the Arena Gardens.

=== Final standings ===
== Playoffs ==

Because the Ottawa Senators won both halves of the split regular season, there was no need for an NHL playoff. The Senators were named NHL champions and given a spot in the Stanley Cup championship series. Representing the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) was the Seattle Metropolitans, which battled in a tight PCHA, in which two wins separated its three teams. A problem arose as Seattle&#x27;s green, red, and white uniforms looked similar to Ottawa&#x27;s black, red, and white uniforms. The Senators agreed to play in white sweaters. The five-game series was scheduled to be played in Ottawa, but unseasonably warm weather forced the final two games to Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens.

=== Stanley Cup Finals ===
Games one, three and five were played under NHL rules (without a rover), while games two and four were played under PCHA rules (with a rover).

== Awards ==
* NHL champion – Ottawa Senators

Note:
The O&#x27;Brien Cup, still considered the championship of the NHA, was not awarded in 1920. It remained under the care of the Canadiens who had won it in 1917, until the death of their owner, George Kennedy in 1921, when the NHL made arrangements to re-use the trophy. The Hockey Hall of Fame lists Ottawa as the winner for 1919–20.

<doc id="782693" wikidata="Q507456" url="?curid=782693" title="Stanley Motor Carriage Company">
<text>The Stanley Motor Carriage Company was an American manufacturer of steam cars that operated from 1902 to 1924, going defunct after it failed to adapt to competition from rapidly improving Internal combustion engine vehicles. The cars made by the company were colloquially called Stanley Steamers although several different models were produced.

==Early history==
Twins Francis E. Stanley (1849–1918) and Freelan O. Stanley (1849–1940) founded the company, after selling their photographic dry plate business to Eastman Kodak. They made their first car in 1897. During 1898 and 1899, they produced and sold over 200 cars, more than any other U.S. maker. 

In 1899, Freelan and his wife Flora drove one of their cars to the top of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. The ascent took more than two hours and was notable as being the first time a car had climbed the long Mount Washington Carriage Road. The Stanleys later sold the rights to this early design to Locomobile. In 1902 they formed their own Stanley Motor Carriage Company.&#x27;

== Specifications and design ==


Early Stanley cars had light wooden bodies mounted on wooden &quot;perch poles&quot; with full-elliptic springs. Steam was generated in a vertical fire-tube boiler, mounted beneath the seat, with a vaporizing gasoline (later, kerosene) burner underneath. The boiler was reinforced by several layers of piano wire wound around it, which gave it a strong but relatively light-weight shell. In early models, the vertical fire-tubes were made of copper, and were expanded into holes in the upper and lower crown sheets. In later models, the installation of a condenser caused oil-fouling in the expansion joints, and welded steel fire-tubes had to be used. The boilers were reasonably safe since they were fitted with safety valves. Even if these failed, any dangerous over pressure would rupture one of the joints long before the boiler shell itself could burst. The resulting leakage would relieve the boiler pressure and douse the burner with very little risk to the passenger. There is not a single documented incident of a Stanley boiler exploding.

The engine had two double-acting cylinders, side-by-side and equipped with slide-valves, and it was a simple-expansion type. Drive was transmitted directly by the crankshaft to a rear-mounted differential using a chain. Owners often modified their Locomobiles by adding third-party accessories, including improved lubricators, condensers, and devices which eased the laborious starting procedure.

To overcome patent difficulties with the design they had sold to Locomobile, the Stanley brothers developed a new model with twin-cylinder engines geared directly to the rear axle. Later models had aluminium coachwork that resembled the internal combustion cars of the time, but they retained steam-car features by having no transmission, clutch, or driveshaft. They also had a fully sprung tubular steel frame.

When they later moved the steam boiler to the front of the vehicle, the owners dubbed it the &quot;coffin nose.&quot; The compact engine ran at considerable steam pressure, with the boiler described in 1912 as having the safety valve set at , with the burner set to automatically cut back when pressure reached . The twin-cylinder steam engines were at that time 10 horsepower, with bore and stroke, and with bore and stroke, and made extensive use of ball bearings. In order to improve range, condensers were added from 1915.

A Stanley Steamer set the world record for the fastest mile in an automobile (28.2 seconds) in 1906. This record () was not broken by any automobile until 1911, although Glen Curtiss beat the record in 1907 with a V-8-powered motorcycle at . The record for steam-powered automobiles was not broken until 2009.

Production rose to 519 cars in 1917.

The Stanley Steamer was sometimes nicknamed &quot;The Flying Teapot&quot;. At least one Stanley Steamer found its way to Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia where it was driven in the late 1920s.

== Overview of production figures ==
== Obsolescence ==
During the mid to late 1910s, the fuel efficiency and power delivery of internal combustion engines improved dramatically and using an electric starter instead of the crank, which had been notorious for injuring its operators, led to the rise of the internal combustion powered automobile, which also was much cheaper. The Stanley company produced a series of advertising campaigns trying to recover the car-buying public away from the &quot;internal explosion engine,&quot; but it was unsuccessful. Their advertising slogan was, &quot;Power – Correctly Generated, Correctly Controlled, Correctly Applied to the Rear Axle.&quot; These were early examples of the fear, uncertainty and doubt advertising campaign, since their aim was not to convince buyers of the advantages of the Stanley Steamer but to suggest that internal combustion automobiles could explode.

== Sale and closure ==
Francis died in 1918 when he steered his car off the road into a woodpile while attempting to avoid farm wagons travelling side by side. After his death, Freelan sold his interests to Prescott Warren. The company suffered a period of decline and technological stagnation. Production specifications show that no model with a power output of more than was produced after 1918. Better cars were now available at much lower cost. For example, a 1924 Stanley 740D sedan cost $3,950, compared with less than $500 for a Ford Model T. The widespread use of electric starters in internal combustion cars, beginning in 1912, eroded the remaining technological advantages of the steam car.

The smaller scale of merchandising, a lack of effective advertising, and the general desire of motorists for higher speeds and faster starting than offered by Stanley vehicles were the primary causes of the company&#x27;s demise. The factory closed permanently in 1924.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1935 MGM film &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;,
Lionel Barrymore owns a Stanley Steamer. His character claims to have paid $5 for it.
A song titled &quot;The Stanley Steamer&quot; appears in the 1948 film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (itself a remake of the above &quot;Ah, Wilderness&quot;) starring Mickey Rooney and Gloria DeHaven. The number, written by Harry Warren with lyrics by Ralph Blane, features an extended musical sequence with what appears to be a fairly early yellow 10 HP model. Stanley from &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Cars 2&quot;, and the &quot;Cars Toons&quot; short &quot;Time Travel Mater&quot; is a Stanley Steamer. Another Stanley Steamer appears in the 1965 film &quot;The Great Race&quot; starring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, with Natalie Wood as the driver of the car. And a Stanley Steamer appears in the 2003 film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. 

Boston Red Sox pitcher Bob Stanley was nicknamed &quot;Stanley Steamer&quot;.

<doc id="782696" wikidata="Q105653630" url="?curid=782696" title="Doogh">
<text>Doogh is a cold and savoury Iranian drink. It is made with fermented milk. Unlike its sister beverage of Turkish origin, ayran, Doogh is not diluted yogurt. According to the Iranian Ministry of Food Standards, Doogh &quot;is a drink resulting from lactic fermentation of milk whose dry matter is standardized by diluting yogurt (after fermentation) or buttermilk (before fermentation).&quot; 

== Production ==
Milk and plain yogurt, at a ratio of 15:1, are mixed and placed on low heat until uniformly warm. Salt is added and the mixture is poured into a closed container and placed in a warm area for 3–4 days, after which it is ready to serve. The longer the drink is left to ferment, the more savoury it becomes. Many subcultures in Iran prefer a longer fermentation period.

== Etymology ==
Doogh has historically been referenced in Persian literature as the representation of a &quot;sour version&quot; of milk. The history of this word is uncertain. It is present in Avestan scripture, and essentially seems to have been another word for milk, or for the product of milking thus, the word Doogh derives from the Persian word for milking, &quot;dooshidan&quot;.

In Avestan scripture, doogh is defined as milk. Additionally, in the Avesta, the word for &quot;girl,&quot; or &quot;woman,&quot; or &quot;female,&quot; is &quot;dooghtar&quot;, which means &quot;the one who milks/is milked,&quot; and sounds very similar to the current-day word in Persian for &quot;girl,&quot; &quot;dokhtar&quot;. Some Persian language scholars claim that the English word &quot;daughter&quot; also derives from this word.

== History ==
Doogh (دوغ) is an Iranian fermented drink that has long been a popular drink and was consumed in ancient Iran (Persia).
Doogh is mentioned in Persian literature from the middle period. In Avicenna&#x27;s Kitab al-Qanun the word denotes milk used medically. Though Avicenna wrote in Arabic, the word &quot;doogh&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist in Arabic, .

== Culture ==
Doogh is recognized as one of the main Iranian beverages to serve alongside meals. Dishes such as Dizi and Chelo-Kabab are the most commonly served with doogh. 

In some parts of Iran, mainly Isfahan, doogh is served with the sweet pastry Gosh-e fil as a hallmark tradition and snack.

In Iranian popular culture doogh is also considered to have a sedative effect. Pop culture jokes imply that it is a bad idea to drink doogh during lunch at work or school.

<text>AusRegistry was a Melbourne, Australia based company that specialised in domain name registry services.

AusRegistry was the registry operator and wholesale provider for all commercial .au (Australian) domain names including .com.au and .net.au and the non-commercial domain names .edu.au and .gov.au - for over 16 years, from 2002 until 1 July 2018. It doesn&#x27;t provide any services to the general public.

In 2002, after an open tender, AusRegistry was awarded a four-year contract to operate the domain name registry for auDA. In 2005, after another open tender, AusRegistry was once again selected to be the registry operator for a second four-year period commencing on 1 July 2006. Controversially, in February 2009 auDA announced that it had extended its .au Registry Licence Agreement with Ausregistry until 2014 without a tender bid.

A 2012 report found that 99% of registered domains were within the .com.au, .net.au and .org.au spaces.

AusRegistry&#x27;s TLD registry is compliant with the latest Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) standards and was one of the first to offer rapid DNS updating in ccTLD zone files.

AusRegistry International is a subsidiary of AusRegistry that provides domain name registry services outside of Australia and other registry services.

AusRegistry previously operated the Renewable Energy Certificates Registry under contract to the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator (ORER) a statutory authority established to administer the Australian Government&#x27;s Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. In 2005, AusRegistry International was awarded the tender to re-develop and manage the REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) Registry system until 2010. The REC registry currently manages over 13.5 million objects within stringent SLAs covering availability and response times.

In July 2015, Neustar Inc. announced the purchased of Bombora Technologies, the parent company of AusRegistry for $118.5 million.
In December 2016, it was announced that the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital would acquire Neustar Inc. for about $2.9 billion. Singapore&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd is involved in the deal and will a minority owner in Neustar Inc. 
In December 2017, auDA announced that after 16 years of running the .AU registry, AusRegistry lost a competitive tender process to Afilias, who will take over the running of the .AU registry on 1 July 2018.

<text>Renison University College is an affiliated university college of the University of Waterloo and located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Renison&#x27;s campus is situated on the western border of Waterloo&#x27;s main campus. The university college offers academic programs that count as credit toward a University of Waterloo degree. Most academic courses are offered within Waterloo&#x27;s Faculty of Arts, focusing on social sciences, language, and culture.

Renison focuses its academic work in three primary areas: Social Engagement and Innovation; Global Engagement through Languages and Cultures; and Community Engagement through the offering of non-degree programs and praxis-based learning related to various degrees. Renison&#x27;s social engagement and Innovation focus is developed in the work of the department of Social Development Studies and Renison&#x27;s School of Social Work. The focus on global engagements finds expression in a variety of forms, most notably through the work of the department of Culture and Language Studies and the Studies in Islam program unit. Its focus on Community Engagement is gathered in the Centre for Community and Professional Education.

Renison University College maintains a residence that houses up to 214 University of Waterloo students. Residents may be in any field of undergraduate study at the University of Waterloo and are not mandated to take courses at Renison. The university college residence maintains one of the lowest don-to-student ratios of all the on-campus residences.

The institution was established on January 14, 1959, as Renison College, under the authority of the Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Huron. In 2010, it officially became Renison University College as a reflection of Renison&#x27;s academic focus. It was founded by members of the local Anglican community in Waterloo, Ontario, and Kitchener, Ontario, and continues to be affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada.

==History==

Renison was incorporated on January 14, 1959, by provincial Letters Patent and under the authority of the Synod of the Diocese of Huron, due to the efforts of the Kitchener and Waterloo Anglican communities. The efforts of Renison Founder The Ven. Harvey Southcott, who was rector of Church of the Holy Saviour at the time, were particularly influential as he had the original vision for an Anglican college in Waterloo. Renison continues to enjoy support from the Anglican community and, in particular, from within the diocese.

Originally a two-storey, seven-room house at 193 Albert Street in Waterloo that opened its doors in 1959, Renison College featured a small chapel, chaplain&#x27;s office, a small library, a study and meeting space for students, and three bedrooms that accommodated seven male students. The college offered courses in religious knowledge, geography and philosophy.

On July 1, 1960, Renison struck an affiliation agreement with the University of Waterloo for the right to offer programs in Arts and the Social Sciences for credit towards a Bachelor of Arts degree from Waterloo. The university transferred five acres of land on the west side of its campus to Renison in 1961, and Renison purchased an additional acre.

===Name change===
Originally incorporated in 1959 as Renison College, it was felt that the addition of the word ‘university’ would strengthen Renison&#x27;s reputation and identity with international partners. During her tenure as Principal, Dr. Gail Cuthbert Brandt had explored the option of gaining an individual charter for Renison. However, it wasn&#x27;t until Dr. John Crossley&#x27;s tenure in the mid-2000s that the process began to move forward. In 2010, following years of negotiations, supplementary Letters Patent were issued by the Government of Ontario, making the official name of the college &#x27;Renison University College&#x27; and reflecting Renison&#x27;s academic focus.

===Namesake===
Renison University College was named after a contemporary Canadian church leader, The Most Reverend Robert John Renison. Archbishop Renison served in the Anglican Church of Canada with great distinction for nearly six decades, a significant amount of that time being spent in Northern Ontario. Before his death in 1957, he became Metropolitan of Ontario and Archbishop of Moosonee. Archbishop Renison&#x27;s widow, Elisabeth, presented the college with his portrait and a painting of his personal coat of arms. The family agreed to let the new institution use his heraldic emblem and accompanying motto, Sed Coelum Solum (one sky over all), until the college was granted its own unique coat of arms in 1978.

==Campus==

Renison is situated on 6 acres of land in Waterloo, Ontario and is directly adjacent to the University of Waterloo campus. Most buildings on the University of Waterloo campus are a five-minute walk from Renison. Renison&#x27;s campus is bordered by the University of Waterloo, St. Jerome&#x27;s University, and United College (formerly: St. Paul&#x27;s University College). One numbered road intersects Renison&#x27;s campus: Westmount Road North.

===Buildings===
In 1962, Renison completed its first building on the current campus, the Founders Building, which provided offices, classrooms, and two residence wings to house 40 men and 40 women. The cornerstone of this first building on Renison&#x27;s campus was laid by Elizabeth Renison and LCol. J. Keiller MacKay, 19th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.

Thanks to Renison and the other affiliated colleges, 1962 was the first time Waterloo students could live on campus as the first Waterloo residence would not be opened until 1965.

In 1964, Renison expanded with the construction of the Luxton Building, with classrooms, faculty offices, and a residence for 98 men, allowing the Founders Building to be used as the women&#x27;s residence. This building was named for George N. Luxton, Bishop of Huron and Renison&#x27;s first chancellor and, later, first Visitor. The Luxton Building would also come to include a favourite place for student relaxation at Renison, the Moose Room.

Then, in 1992, the college expanded further with the addition of the Chapel of St. Bede, the Great Hall cafeteria, two additional residence floors, and an enlarged library. This would be followed in 2005 with the addition of the Academic Centre. This building included six large classrooms, office space to accommodate Renison&#x27;s growing faculty and staff, the Keiko and Charles Belair Centre for East Asian Studies, a substantially larger library with meeting rooms and the Ministry Centre.

2013 saw the completion of the East Side Extension, which is home to new classroom space, student lounges, and Renison&#x27;s School of Social Work. Ontario&#x27;s 28th Lieutenant Governor, David C. Onley, was in attendance at the grand opening to declare the building officially open.

Renison completed its newest building in 2015 and was opened by David Johnston, Governor General of Canada and former president of the University of Waterloo. This building is home to Renison&#x27;s English Language Institute and English Language Studies. With 17 new classrooms, the complex also features student lounges, meeting rooms, a glass atrium capable of hosting small events, and office space for staff and faculty members.

===Lusi Wong Library===
Renison houses the Lusi Wong Library, whose collection focuses on the subjects taught at Renison. Renison students have access to over 7 million items within the library&#x27;s resources through the Tri-University Group of Libraries (TUG) system. TUG is part of a partnership involving the libraries of the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Guelph. Students have access to library resources totaling 7.5 million items through the automated library system. Renison students are able to borrow books and other resources from any of the three libraries and have them delivered to the Lusi Wong Library for pick-up. Likewise, any books borrowed from these three universities’ libraries can be returned at Renison. Study rooms are available for students to book for group work or small meetings. In a poll conducted by the University of Waterloo&#x27;s student newspaper, The Imprint, Renison&#x27;s Lusi Wong Library was voted the best place to study on campus.

===The Luscott Ministry Centre===
Renison is home to the Luscott Ministry Centre, where all students, staff, and faculty have the opportunity to relax on couches, enjoy free coffee, tea, and cookies, and make use of a variety of stress relief activities. The Ministry Centre contains the offices of the Assistant Director, Student Experience and Housing, and Renison&#x27;s Chaplain, with whom many students, staff, and faculty discuss questions (big and small), concerns, and joys. The Ministry Centre is a meeting place where community forms, faith is a welcome part of conversation, and transformation is championed.

=== Link Inclusion Lounge ===
In September 2024, a new space was unveiled at the college called the Link Inclusion Lounge. The space celebrates itself as a welcoming and inclusive space for students from equity-deserving communities to connect together and strengthen their feelings of belonging on campus. The space, located in the “Link” wing of Renison in the previous Registrar!s Office space, includes office space for two Inclusion Coordinators (Bachelor of Social Work placement students) as well as a one-on-one meeting space. Events to bring students from equity-deserving communities together are facilitated in this space.

===Chapel of St. Bede===
The Chapel of St. Bede is the Anglican chapel at Renison University College, and is part of the Diocese of Huron. Monday evening worship is held here, along with midweek prayers, and is officiated by the college&#x27;s chaplain, The Rev. Scott McLeod. The chapel is also available for anyone to use for prayer or meditation.

==Administration==
The college operates under a unicameral system consisting of a board of governors. The board of governors has responsibility for the university&#x27;s properties, affairs and income and determines approval for tenure and sabbatical for professors of the college.

The board of governors consists of nine ex officio members including the college&#x27;s chancellor, president, the president of the University of Waterloo, the Bishop of the Diocese of Huron, one representative for the faculty and one for the staff, and the presidents of both the residence and academic student leadership committees of Renison. The other nine members of the board are elected members. One of these members must be a representative of the Anglican Diocese of Niagara and at least one member of the board must be an alumnus/alumna of Renison.

The president, appointed by the board of governors, acts as the chief executive officer of the college and is responsible for administering the affairs of the college. The president acts on behalf of the board with respect to the operational management and control of the college. The president is the chair of Academic Council as well as Student Affairs and Community Education (SACE) Council, and is a member of the board. The president is appointed for a term of five years with the possibility of renewal. The president also holds the position of vice-chancellor of the college, assuming the duties of the chancellor during his/her absence or temporary vacancy in the office. The current president and vice-chancellor is The Rev. Dr. Marc Jerry who began his term as the twelfth president (formerly called principal) of the college in July, 2024.

The chancellor, who serves as the titular head of the college, is elected by the members of the board for a term of four years with the possibility of renewal. The primary duty of the chancellor is to preside at all Renison convocations, and grant honours to candidates on behalf of the college at Founders Day. The office of the Chancellor is currently vacant. 

The visitor to the college is the bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Huron, currently The Rt. Rev. R. Todd Townshend, Th.D. The visitor is a member of the corporation of Renison University College and maintains the right to inspect the state of the college from time to time. The Visitor maintains a seat on the board but may appoint a representative to fulfill this position. The visitor may also make comment on the state of the college to the board of governors and/or the president.

===Title change===

As of January 25, 2017, the title of the head administrator of the college was changed by the board of governors from principal to president. This was done to clarify the role of the president as the head of a university college when travelling abroad. The title of president was felt to be more universally recognized.

==Academics==
Renison focuses its academic work in three primary areas: Social Engagement and Innovation; Global Engagement through Languages and Cultures; and Community Engagement through the offering of non-degree program and praxis-based learning related to various degrees. Renison&#x27;s social engagement and Innovation focus is developed in the work of the department of Social Development Studies and Renison&#x27;s School of Social Work.

There are both double-occupancy and single-occupancy rooms available. There are a variety of student lounges available that make for quiet study space and activity space.

Meals are provided in house with a cafeteria providing three meals a day during the week and brunch and dinner on weekends. Bagged lunches are available on request for students that are unable to return to the college for lunch. All meal costs are included in residence fees and, as such, do not have a decreasing balance of meal plan money to monitor.

====Residence don team ====
Dons are upper-year students who live in the residence and support Renison&#x27;s Student Experience and Housing team in their work of providing support to students, facilitating recreation programming, facility supervision, and rule enforcement. Dons are the primary point of contact for all residents whether it is asking for assistance, resolving conflict, responding to emergencies, or planning floor events. Renison&#x27;s residence has the distinction of having the lowest don-to-student ratio on campus (1 to 21).

===Student leadership committees===
In Fall 2024, Renison repositioned its student government councils into student leadership committees, reframing these student volunteer opportunities as a chance for all students to build and develop their leadership skills without fear of needing to possess any prior student governance experience.

====Renisix (residence student leadership committee)====
Renisix is tasked with enhancing the social atmosphere of the college for those who live in its residence halls. A student-run leadership team headed by a peer leader, Renisix gives students the opportunity to take ownership of their residence experience and provide opportunities for students to have fun and meet others in the college.

Peer Leaders’ responsibilities include: providing learning opportunities that complement in-class studies, helping athletes become involved in Renison Residence community events, providing support for academic success, and acting as a resource to assist with athletic or personal concerns.

===Mace===

Maces have been used to symbolize authority and order since early medieval times. Parliaments, universities and civic governments use a mace to remind all that their right to govern and teach comes from the Crown; in Renison&#x27;s case, the Crown in Right of Ontario.

Renison&#x27;s mace is made of local wood from the Waterloo area and fashioned by local artisans. It follows the shape of most maces with a crown, a bowl, and a wooden shaft. The Mace is to be carried by an honoured member of the college in front of the chancellor at convocations and special ceremonies.

The crown is carved with maple leaves and trilliums, reflecting the institution of the Crown in Canada and Ontario. The bowl has three coats of arms; Renison University College, University of Waterloo, and the personal arms of Spence. Carved moose heads, derived from the crest of the coat of arms, support the bowl.

Down the shaft of the mace is the small coat of arms belonging to The Rev. Canon David Bowyer, Honorary Senior Fellow of Renison and painter of the mace.

===Staves===

Normally carried by two students, the two Processional Staves lead the academic procession. Each bears Renison&#x27;s shield and badge of the college. They represent the two halves of Renison&#x27;s student body: the residents and the academic students.

<doc id="782714" wikidata="Q5708" url="?curid=782714" title="Päijät-Häme">
<text>Päijät-Häme (; ) is a region in Southern Finland south of the lake Päijänne. It borders the regions of Uusimaa, Kanta-Häme, Pirkanmaa, Central Finland, South Savo and Kymenlaakso. The biggest city in the region is Lahti.

Päijät-Häme boasts a landscape shaped by two key features. Finland&#x27;s second-largest, Lake Päijänne, dominates the region, offering a vast freshwater expanse and a vital transportation route. The Häme Ridge, a glacial remnant, adds a touch of elevation and scenic variation. Beyond these, Päijät-Häme features extensive coniferous forests. Rolling hills provide scenic views, while numerous smaller lakes and rivers create a network of waterways.

== History ==

Päijät-Häme&#x27;s landscape reflects the dramatic retreat of glaciers. The last Ice Age carved the land, leaving ridges (Salpausselkä) and large lakes (Finnish Lakeland). As the ice melted, the Baltic Sea went through various stages, dramatically changing shorelines. Land rose, creating islands and eventually dry land. Human settlement followed the receding water, with the Porvoo River valley being the oldest cultural landscape. Today, Päijät-Häme boasts a unique blend of lakes, ridges, and reminders of its glacial past.

After glaciers retreated 11,000 years ago, the first settlers arrived in Päijät-Häme. Birch dominated the initially barren landscape. As the climate warmed, people lived near ancient lakes and bays. By 5100 BC, the Comb Ceramic culture thrived. The arrival of the Battle Axe culture around 3200 BC brought new tools and pottery styles. During the Bronze Age (1900 BC), cremation burials and large stone cairns became common. In the Iron Age, settlements shifted to better farming areas near waterways. Viking raids and unrest marked the later Iron Age. Christianity arrived during the Crusades (1050-1300 AD).

By the Middle Ages, villages dotted the shores of waterways and lakes. The 16th century saw a solidification of village life, with the most prominent settlements around Hollola, Lahti, and Nastola. The 1800s brought a boom in agriculture, with cultivated land tripling and industries like flax farming and cattle raising flourishing. Forests were mostly owned by farms, and improved transportation facilitated timber sales. Manor houses played a crucial role in rural life until World War I, with some later being divided into new farms. Today, Päijät-Häme&#x27;s settlement can be divided into three zones: the sparsely populated eastern area with smaller farms and estates, the more densely populated central region with a strong presence of independent farms, and the sparsely populated north with vast forests. As transportation networks evolved, settlement patterns shifted, with Lahti emerging as the dominant population center.

Villages in Päijät-Häme have a long history intertwined with the landscape. Most likely arose around the 16th century, strategically placed near ridges and waterways for easy access to water and fertile land. Water remained the primary mode of transportation for centuries, with some villages even shifting their centers to be closer to navigable routes. The arrival of railways in the 19th century revolutionized transportation, and later road networks further influenced development. Heinola, for example, benefitted from its location near the Kymijoki River, which facilitated industrial growth once railways arrived. This pattern likely mirrored itself across Päijät-Häme during the 1800s and 1900s.

Heinola, founded in 1776, became the region&#x27;s first city in 1839. Industrial areas grew around its center, particularly on the east and south sides. Lahti&#x27;s story is tied to railways and lakeside industry. It gained market town rights in 1878 and city status in 1905. Factories like sawmills, a pulp mill, and match factories fueled Lahti&#x27;s expansion. Village churches (kirkonkylät) also saw growth from the 1860s onward, spurred by relaxed land ownership laws. However, rapid expansion in some villages obscured their older features. Lahti housed sawmills, pulp mills, glass factories, and textile producers. Heinola developed sawmills, plywood, and fiberboard factories alongside metalworking. Notably, Hämeenkoski had Finland&#x27;s first flax cleaning plant built in 1888. Worker housing districts accompanied industrial growth. The passage mentions both early examples and later, larger developments from the post-war period and the 1960s and 70s.

<text>Philip Percy Cooper Drabble (13 May 1914 – 29 July 2007) was an English , author and television presenter (notably &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot;). Brought up in the Black Country, he later lived in – and wrote mostly about – the countryside of north Worcestershire and at Abbots Bromley in East Staffordshire, where he created a nature reserve.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Drabble was an only child, whose mother died when he was young. His father was a GP and they lived in a terraced house in Bloxwich. He began work as a factory lad and rose to the board of Salters and membership of the management board of the Midland Engineering Employers Association.

In 1947, he made his first radio broadcast, and in 1952 his first television appearance. At the age of 47 he became a full-time writer, and he and his wife Jess purchased a derelict folly-styled cottage and of neglected ancient woodland in Abbots Bromley, Staffordshire, a remnant of the Needwood Forest.

===&quot;One Man and His Dog&quot; and later life===

Drabble was best known as presenter of the long-running TV series &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot;, in which he commentated on sheepdog trials for 17 years from 1976 to 1993. At its peak the BBC programme attracted more than 8 million viewers and even the Queen was a fan, asking Drabble for advice after her liberty budgies were attacked by hawks at Windsor. Declared Midlander of the Year in 1992, and made OBE in the year he retired from the programme, he announced in 1993 that it had become &quot;a bit boring watching dogs chase stroppy sheep round a field.&quot;

A pub very near Drabble&#x27;s former home in Bloxwich is named &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot; in his honour.

===Later life===
Drabble, who also wrote a newspaper column for the Express &amp; Star, took few holidays, travelled abroad only a couple of times, and was proud to have never lived more than 20 miles from his place of birth.

He and his wife turned the woodland they had bought and lived next to into the Goat Lodge Reserve. After a fight with Center Parcs who wanted to build a centre just outside its borders, it became a recognised Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Predeceased eighteen months earlier by his wife, Drabble died at his home in Abbots Bromley on 29 July 2007, at the age of 93. Having never had any children, he left the majority of his £1,013,523 estate to his PA of 25 years, Ruth Froggatt.

<doc id="782723" wikidata="Q4660910" url="?curid=782723" title="A for Andromeda">
<text>A for Andromeda is a British television science fiction drama serial first made and broadcast by the BBC in seven parts in 1961. Written by cosmologist Fred Hoyle, in conjunction with author and television producer John Elliot, it concerns a group of scientists who detect a radio signal from another galaxy that contains instructions for the design of an advanced computer. When the computer is built, it gives the scientists instructions for the creation of a living organism named Andromeda, but one of the scientists, John Fleming, fears that Andromeda&#x27;s purpose is to subjugate humanity.

The serial was the first major role for the actress Julie Christie. Only one episode of the original production survives, along with a few short extracts from other episodes. &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; has been remade twice: first by the Italian state television RAI in 1972 and by the BBC in 2006. A sequel, &quot;The Andromeda Breakthrough&quot;, was made by the BBC in 1962.

==Plot==
The opening titles of each episode are prefaced by a television interview in which Professor Ernst Reinhart (Esmond Knight) looks back on the events of the serial.

===&quot;The Message&quot;===
Great Britain, 1970 – a new radio telescope, designed by the young scientists John Fleming (Peter Halliday) and Dennis Bridger (Frank Windsor) under the supervision of Professor Reinhart (Esmond Knight), has been built at Bouldershaw Fell. Shortly before its official opening, the telescope picks up a signal from the distant Andromeda Nebula. Examining the signal, Fleming realises that the signal is a computer program.

===&quot;The Machine&quot;===
Fleming is permitted to use the computer facilities at the London Institute of Electronics, where he is aided by Christine (Julie Christie). Using the computer to decode the message, Fleming realises that the message contains a set of instructions for the construction of another more advanced computer. The message also contains another program for the computer to run, and data to process. Bridger meanwhile, has sold out to an international conglomerate called Intel, represented by the sinister Kaufmann (John Hollis). The British government decides to build the computer at a military establishment at Thorness in Scotland. The computer is switched on and begins to output its first set of instructions.

===&quot;The Miracle&quot;===
The team at Thorness is joined by the biologist Madeline Dawnay (Mary Morris). The computer is outputting instructions for the creation of living cells. Fleming becomes nervous, worried that whatever life-form they are creating may not have humanity&#x27;s best interests at heart. Dawney proceeds with the experiment, however, synthesising a primitive protoplasmic life-form. In the meantime, Bridger&#x27;s leaking of Thorness&#x27; secrets has been discovered. Bridger is confronted by Ministry of Defence agent Judy Adamson (Patricia Kneale); fleeing he tumbles over a cliff to his death.

===&quot;The Monster&quot;===
It is now 1971 and the protoplasmic lifeform, now nicknamed &quot;Cyclops&quot; on account of its giant eye, continues to grow. Fleming has become ever more sceptical about the project, certain that the computer has its own agenda. He comes to realise that two terminals positioned either side of the computer&#x27;s main display have the ability to affect the brainwaves of those who stand near it. His warnings are not heeded, however, and Christine, mesmerised by Cyclops and by the machine, is compelled to grasp the two terminals – she falls to the floor, killed by a massive electric shock.

===&quot;The Murderer&quot;===
Following Christine&#x27;s death, the computer outputs a new set of instructions – this time for the creation of a complete human embryo. Fleming is horrified and demands that it be killed. He is ignored. The embryo rapidly grows to maturity; everyone is stunned when it is revealed to be a clone of the deceased Christine. The creature – which they name &quot;Andromeda&quot; – quickly learns to communicate and is brought before the computer. The computer, realising its instructions have been carried out, destroys Cyclops as it has been superseded by Andromeda.

===&quot;The Face of the Tiger&quot;===
Andromeda is put to work developing a program to enable Britain to intercept orbital missiles which a foreign power is firing over British airspace as a demonstration of power. Using the missiles designed by Andromeda, they are successful in destroying one of the missiles. The Government is now determined to make full use of Andromeda, not just for defence but also to aid industry. Fleming continues to make trouble and has his access to the computer revoked. He is horrified to discover that the Government has made a trade deal with Kaufmann and Intel for the rights to a new enzyme that Andromeda has developed that heals injured cells. By this stage, Dawnay is also beginning to have doubts about Andromeda – she agrees to aid Fleming by entering a program into the computer to convince it Andromeda is dead. The program is quickly discovered and reversed by Andromeda. However, the computer soon exacts its revenge – it corrupts the formula for the enzyme, making Dawnay and her assistants sick.

===&quot;The Last Mystery&quot;===
It is 1972 and the message from the Andromeda Nebula has stopped transmitting. Fleming has been able to determine the correct formula to counteract the effects of the enzyme and save Dawnay. Fleming, Dawnay, Reinhart, and Judy now agree that Andromeda must be stopped – however, the military now has control over the project. Andromeda tries to kill Fleming but fails; she confesses to Fleming that she is a slave of the computer, which is working to take over humanity. Fleming gains entry to the computer room where he takes an axe to the machine, destroying it. Now free of the machine Andromeda is able to access the safe that contains the copies of the original message with the instructions for building the computer which she burns so that the machine cannot be rebuilt. She flees with Fleming to one of the islands near the base. Pursued by soldiers, they hide in a series of caves on the island. However, Andromeda is apparently killed when she falls into a deep pool. The dejected Fleming is brought back to Thorness by the soldiers.

==Background==

===Origins===
Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term &quot;Big Bang&quot; for the steady state theory&#x27;s rival dynamic evolving model of the universe. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, &quot;The Black Cloud&quot; (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service. The BBC were also interested in adapting &quot;The Black Cloud&quot; for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed &quot;The Black Cloud&quot; with another science fiction novel, &quot;Ossian&#x27;s Ride&quot; (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;. Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun &quot;Project Ozma&quot;, one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot. Hoyle replied, &quot;It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns. I estimate that such a sum would still be only 2–3 percent of the receipts by the BBC from licences. Such a percentage still seems low – it is considerably less than rates available in the US&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitton/254&quot;&gt;Mitton, &quot;Conflict in the Cosmos&quot;, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a fee of 700 guineas was agreed. Elliot delivered his draft scripts between March and April 1961; at this point it was decided that each episode should run for 45 minutes and so Elliot had to work to expand each script.

===Casting===

The title role of Andromeda was played by Julie Christie. Hoyle originally saw Andromeda as an androgynous character but Elliot changed this to a young woman. The production team were keen to cast a young, unknown actress. While searching for a suitable candidate, co-producer and director Michael Hayes met an agent who suggested Julie Christie, then a student at the Central School of Speech and Drama, recommending her as &quot;the new Bardot&quot;. In playing the part, Christie wanted to give the character of Andromeda more emotion but Hayes directed her to act more impassively, using his camera to define the character. Mindful that a sequel was under consideration, Hayes advised the BBC to sign her up before she became a big star; he was ignored and the role had to be recast for the sequel, &quot;The Andromeda Breakthrough&quot;. Christie went on to have a highly successful film career, her breakthrough role occurring in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965).

Peter Halliday played John Fleming. He had trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company where he met and befriended Michael Hayes. Halliday had a reputation for playing angry young men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/9&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the serial was set in the near future, both Hoyle&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/6&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Hayes felt that women would occupy more progressive roles in the years to come. This was reflected in the writing and casting; appearing as the security services agent, Judy Adamson, was Patricia Kneale. Kneale found the character &quot;a rather prissy sort of person, not really the sort of person I usually played at all.&quot; A late change to the script was changing the sex of the biologist character, George Dawnay, to Madeline Dawnay; writing to Mary Morris offering her the part, Hayes said, &quot;don&#x27;t be put off by the fact that the lady appears to smoke a pipe half way through and give vent to some rather strange utterances.&quot;

===Production===
Norman James had hoped to produce the serial himself but the BBC felt it was too complex an undertaking for a novice producer. However, James was given the role of co-producer and designer; he also received an additional payment in acknowledgement of his role in developing the serial. Assigned as co-producer and director was Michael Hayes who had directed the Shakespearean serial &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; (1960). Location filming took place in July 1961 around London, including at IBM&#x27;s offices on Wigmore Street, and in the vicinity of Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales where the Manorbier Army Base stood in for the Thorness research centre. The army assisted the production by providing a helicopter for scenes of personnel arriving at Thorness and for aerial shots of the base and environs. They also supplied a pursuit launch for the chase scene in the final episode. A number of pre-filmed inserts were also shot at Ealing Studios. The production then went into studio at BBC Television Centre with each episode recorded every Wednesday between 1 August 1961 and 13 September 1961. For editing purposes, the output of the electronic studio cameras was recorded onto 35mm film rather than videotape. A last minute addition to the serial were the pre-credits sequences at the start of each episode depicting Reinhart recalling the events of the serial in a television interview. These were made in the style of the well-known interview programme &quot;Face to Face&quot; hosted by John Freeman and were shot at Television Centre on 22 September 1961.

===Broadcast and critical reception===
The debut episode of &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; was promoted on the cover of listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;. The accompanying article said, &quot;A new science fiction series is an exciting prospect at any time. When it is backed by the authority of a scientist with the international reputation of Fred Hoyle, it ranks as a major television event&quot;. &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; was broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8:30pm from 3 October 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/30&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Viewing Notes&quot;, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening episode was watched by 7.5 million viewers; however, by the end of the serial this had risen to 12.9 million viewers and the serial averaged 9.6 million viewers over its seven-week run.

&quot;A for Andromeda&quot; met with a varied critical reception. &quot;Science fiction serial starts well&quot;, said &quot;The Times&quot; after the broadcast of the first episode, adding, &quot;Although it is encouraging to have the authority of Professor Fred Hoyle for the scientific credibility of [&quot;A for Andromeda&quot;]... it is the skill of Mr Hoyle the novelist that will mainly be called upon to hold our attention&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregory/140&quot;&gt;Gregory, &quot;Fred Hoyle&#x27;s Universe&quot;, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Evening News&quot;, meanwhile declared the serial to be &quot;a jolly good successor to &quot;Quatermass&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/16&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Viewing Notes&quot;, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Not so impressed was L. Marsland Gander in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; who wrote, &quot;As a devotee of Prof. Hoyle and a keen student of disembodied intelligence I felt impatient... I am too well acquainted with [his] work to be disappointed, but the temptation is great&quot;. A harsher verdict came from Philip Phillips of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; who said, &quot;The next six episodes might be brilliant. But I won&#x27;t be watching them&quot; while &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; said, &quot;I cannot with the best will find anything in the least exciting about &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/17&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC produced an Audience Research report for episodes one, five and seven. Many respondents criticised the serial for being slow and full of scientific terminology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/18&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the serial progressed, viewers became more enthusiastic; after episode five, one viewer said, &quot;The serial, like Andromeda herself, suddenly came alive. This episode was spine-chilling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/19&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Another commented &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the way Andromeda was created – it is absolutely against Christian belief&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pixley/20&quot;&gt;Pixley, &quot;Production Notes&quot;, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; J.A.K. Fraser of Dornock, Scotland, wrote to the BBC&#x27;s correspondence programme &quot;Points of View&quot;, saying, &quot;Enough surely has been seen of Prof. Fleming&#x27;s overacted hysterical outbursts&quot;. Writing to the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, B.W. Wolfe of Basingstoke said, &quot;Congratulations on the recent BBC-tv science-fiction serial &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;. Bug-eyed monsters we have seen before, but never a creature so radiantly beautiful as Andromeda herself. I was completely captivated&quot;. Other letter writers to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; discussed the scientific accuracy of the serial including one correspondent, C.W. Bartlett of Watford, who wrote to inform readers that the reference to DNA (then newly discovered) was not a fictional substance but really existed.

As was common practice at the time, the BBC&#x27;s copies of the serial were junked after broadcast and the bulk of the serial still remains missing. In 2005, a 16mm film print of the sixth episode, &quot;The Face of the Tiger&quot;, was donated to the BBC archives by a private collector; this copy is missing the pre-credits sequence of Reinhart&#x27;s interview. A number of film clips from episodes one, two, three, and seven also exist, as does a full audio-only copy of episode seven, taken from an off-air recording. A complete set of off-air photographs, known as tele-snaps, were taken of all seven episodes and were held in the collection of Michael Hayes prior to his death.

==Remakes==

===&quot;A come Andromeda&quot; (1971)===

A version of the serial entitled &quot;A come Andromeda&quot;, still set in Britain (&quot;in the following year&quot;) but filmed at Italian locations, was made for Italian television (RAI) in 1971. It was adapted by Inisero Cremaschi and directed by Vittorio Cottafavi. This version still exists and has been repeated on Italian TV. It has been released on VHS, and latterly on DVD but without English subtitles. The cast includes Nicoletta Rizzi as Andromeda, Paola Pitagora as Judy Adamson, Luigi Vannucchi as Fleming, and Tino Carraro as Reinhart.

===&quot;A for Andromeda&quot; (2006)===

A second remake of &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; was made by BBC Fictionlab for BBC Four in early 2006. It was produced by Richard Fell, who the previous year had overseen a remake, performed live, of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, another classic BBC science fiction production largely absent from the BBC archives.

==Novelisation==
The prospect of novelising &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; arose early in the serial&#x27;s production when Souvenir Press contacted the BBC in May 1961 indicating their interest in publishing a tie-in novel. John Elliot responded stating that while the concept had been Hoyle&#x27;s, the characterisation, dialogue and plot structure was his. Elliot sent copies of the shooting scripts to Souvenir and was formally commissioned to write the novelisation in July 1961. The terms of the contract concerned Hoyle as they gave Souvenir first call on the sequel; he insisted that this could only be permitted if the sequel&#x27;s novelisation was largely written by Elliot. Elliot delivered his manuscript on 28 September 1961. The novelisation was closer to the original 30-minute scripts and had much of the material required to pad each episode to 45 minutes removed. Promoting it as the story that would &quot;out-&quot;Quatermass&quot; &quot;Quatermass&quot;&quot;, the book was published by Souvenir in February 1962.

&quot;Weekly Science Diary&quot; said, &quot;It is a brightly written, really exciting tale with the added inducement of scientific accuracy&quot;. It has since been translated into several languages. There have also been two alternative versions; the first – issued by Macmillan in 1964 – rewritten by Elliot in simpler English as a study aid for English language students and the second a children&#x27;s version published in 1969.

A major theme of the novel is that information for generating new life can be transmitted by radio signal over galactic distances. Hoyle and Elliot published the novel &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; in 1962 at a time when the fundamental importance of the biological information encoded in DNA was just starting to be understood. The fictional biochemist in the novel, Professor Dawnay, was able to create life forms, initially a bacterial form and later a human female, using what is referred to in the novel as a “D.N.A. synthesizer” and the DNA sequence information transmitted from the Andromeda Galaxy. In the real world of today, whole genomes can actually be built from chemically synthesized DNA sequences, and when inserted into a receptive cellular environment can be brought to life to create a novel organism (see for example Hutchinson et al.). Thus the fictional syntheses of life forms described in the novel anticipated what, today, is starting to be realized.

A combined re-issue of the novel and its sequel was published by the Orion Publishing Group in 2020 under the title &quot;The Andromeda Anthology&quot;, as part of the &quot;SF Masterworks&quot; range. A new introduction was provided by Kim Newman. This edition has also been made into an audiobook, performed by Billie Fulford-Brown.

==In other media==
Several film studios, including MGM, the Associated British Picture Corporation and Hammer Films, made enquiries regarding the film rights to &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;. However, no film version was ever made.

In 2006, BBC Worldwide released a DVD box set, &quot;The Andromeda Anthology&quot;, comprising the original &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Andromeda Breakthrough&quot;. &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; was reconstructed using tele-snaps with on-screen captions to describe the plot set to a soundtrack of music from the serial. The surviving film sequences were placed in the narrative where appropriate and the surviving episode &quot;The Face of the Tiger&quot; was presented in its entirety. Extra features included a commentary on the surviving material by Michael Hayes, Peter Halliday and Frank Windsor; a specially made making-of documentary, &quot;Andromeda Memories&quot;; an excerpt from &quot;Points of View&quot; as well as a photo gallery, PDFs of the shooting scripts and the &quot;Radio Times&quot; articles and detailed production notes by television historian Andrew Pixley. Both the Italian and BBC remakes of &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; have also been released on DVD.

In 2007, footage of Julie Christie and Peter Halliday in the series is seen in &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode, &quot;Random Shoes&quot;.

<text> (, &quot;the dark age/century&quot;), also known as the Pornocracy or the Rule of the Harlots, was a period in the history of the papacy during the first two thirds of the 10th century, following the chaos after the death of Pope Formosus in 896 which saw seven or eight papal elections in as many years. It began with the installation of Pope Sergius III in 904 and lasted for 60 years until the death of Pope John XII in 964. During this period, the popes were influenced strongly by a powerful and allegedly corrupt aristocratic family, the Theophylacti, and their relatives and allies. The era is seen as one of the lowest points of the history of the papal office.

==Periodisation==

The was first named and identified as a period of papal immorality by the Italian cardinal and historian Caesar Baronius in his &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; in the 16th century. Baronius&#x27;s primary source for his history of this period was the contemporaneous writer Bishop Liutprand of Cremona. Baronius himself was writing during the Counter-Reformation, a period of heightened sensitivity to clerical corruption. His characterisation of the early 10th-century papacy was perpetuated by Protestant authors. The terms &quot;&quot; (, from Greek &quot;pornokratiā&quot;, &quot;rule of prostitutes&quot;), hetaerocracy (&quot;government of mistresses&quot;), and the Rule of the Harlots () were coined by Protestant German theologians in the 19th century.

Historian Will Durant refers to the period from 867 to 1049 as the &quot; of the papacy&quot;.

==10th-century popes==

The Theophylacti family were descended from Theophylactus. They held positions of increased importance in the Roman nobility, such as &quot;iudex&quot; (&quot;judge&quot;), vestararius, &quot;gloriosissimus dux&quot; (&quot;most-glorious duke&quot;), consul, senator, and &quot;magister militum&quot;. Theophylact&#x27;s wife Theodora and daughter Marozia held a great influence over the papal selection and religious affairs in Rome through conspiracies, affairs, and marriages.

Marozia became the concubine of 45-year-old Pope Sergius III when she was 15 and later took other lovers and husbands. She ensured that her son John (who was rumoured to have been fathered by Sergius III) was seated as Pope John XI according to &quot;Antapodosis sive Res per Europam gestae&quot; (958–962) by Liutprand of Cremona (–972). Liutprand affirms that Marozia arranged the murder of her former lover Pope John X (who had originally been nominated for office by Theodora) through her then husband Guy of Tuscany, possibly to secure the elevation of her current favourite as Pope Leo VI. There is no record substantiating that Pope John X had definitely died before Leo VI was elected since John X was already imprisoned by Marozia and was out of public view.

Theodora and Marozia held great sway over the popes during this time. In particular, as political rulers of Rome they had effective control over the election of new popes. Much that is alleged about the comes from the histories of Liutprand, Bishop of Cremona. Liutprand took part in the &quot;Assembly of Bishops&quot; which deposed Pope John XII and was a political enemy of the Roman aristocracy and its control over papal elections. Lindsay Brook writes:

==List of popes during the &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot;==

* Pope Sergius III (904–911), alleged lover of Marozia
* Pope Anastasius III (911–913)
* Pope Lando (913–914)
* Pope John X (914–928), alleged lover of Theodora (the mother), allegedly killed by Marozia
* Pope Leo VI (928–928)
* Pope Stephen VII (928–931)
* Pope John XI (931–935), son of Marozia, alleged son of Pope Sergius III
* Pope Leo VII (936–939)
* Pope Stephen VIII (939–942)
* Pope Marinus II (942–946)
* Pope Agapetus II (946–955)
* Pope John XII (955–964), grandson of Marozia, by her son Alberic II of Spoleto

==Family tree==






==The Tusculan Papacy, 1012–1059==

After several Crescentii family popes up to 1012, the Theophylacti still occasionally nominated sons as popes:
* Pope Benedict VIII (1012–1024), son of Count Gregory I
* Pope John XIX (1024–1032), son of Count Gregory I
* Pope Benedict IX (1032–1044, 1045, and 1047–1048), son of Alberic III
* Antipope Benedict X (1058–1059), grandson of Alberic III, driven out of Rome after a small war

Pope Benedict IX went so far as to sell the Papacy to his religious godfather, Pope Gregory VI (1045–1046). Benedict IX then changed his mind, seized the Lateran Palace, and became Pope for the third time in 1047–1048.

The Tusculan Papacy was finally ended by the election of Pope Nicholas II five years after the Great Schism of 1054 who was assisted by Hildebrand of Sovana against Antipope Benedict X. Hildebrand was elected Pope Gregory VII in 1073 and introduced the Gregorian Reforms, increasing the power and independence of the papacy that would lead to help ignite the First Crusade in about 20 years.

<text>Tilgate is one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley in West Sussex, England. The area contains a mixture of privately developed housing, self-build groups and ex-council housing. It is bordered by the districts of Furnace Green to the north east, Southgate to the north west and Broadfield to the south west.

==History==
Tilgate was first mentioned in 13th- and 14th-century tax returns with the inclusion of land owned by William Yllegate (or de illegate).

Within the Tilgate forest in the 17th century was a furnace (&quot;Tilgate Furnace&quot;).

In the 1860s a large house (&quot;Tilgate Mansion&quot;) and estate was created of 2,185 acres (which included of woodland). The entrance and Tilgate Forest Lodge is near Three Bridges railway station. The supply ponds for the furnace survived and became &quot;Tilgate Lake&quot; within the estate.

The estate was associated with the Joliffe family (and later the Nix family of bankers).

The estate was sold by auction on 7 September 1939; this included the park and mansion and properties in Three Bridges. The mansion was converted into flats, used by the Canadian Army during the Second World War but later demolished. The lodge house is now a bank in Three Bridges. The estate became &quot;Tilgate Park&quot;.

==Tilgate: Crawley New Town==
With the creation of Crawley New Town in 1947 the Tilgate area was proposed as a neighbourhood. Construction began in 1955. A reserved area for housing &quot;Tilgate East&quot; was developed as Furnace Green. Tilgate had a population of 7,130 in 1981.

==Tilgate: Crawley==
Tilgate is the home of Tilgate Park, a large area of forest run by the Forestry Commission. The forest contains Tilgate Nature Reserve and Wild Breeds Centre, three recreational lakes (Campbells Lake, Silt Lake and Titmus Lake), park areas, Tilgate Golf Course, and several small commercial buildings known as &#x27;huts&#x27; which are used by small sports and hobby clubs and businesses.

The Thomas Bennett School (opened in 1958) was one of the earliest Comprehensive Schools in England, and by 1967 was the largest secondary school in England. It was named after Sir Thomas Bennett, chairman of Crawley Development Corporation. There are also two Primary schools within the area, as well as a parade of shops, churches, medical facilities, &quot;The Hoppers&quot; public house and other amenities. The area is one of the quietest in Crawley, as the population is largely made up of older residents.

K2, a new leisure centre for Crawley, was opened in November 2005 on land formerly belonging to Thomas Bennett School.

<text>The play 2071 is a &quot;dramatised lecture&quot; written by Chris Rapley, a climate scientist, and playwright Duncan MacMillan. It was first performed in 2014 at the Royal Court Theatre in London.

==Plot==

The play is in Rapley&#x27;s voice and was first performed by him in 2014 at the Royal Court Theatre, London. The piece is partially a memoir of Rapley&#x27;s life and career and partially an explanation of climate change and of the controversies surrounding it. The title, &quot;2071&quot;, is the year in which Rapley&#x27;s oldest grandchild will be 67 years old, which was Rapley&#x27;s age when he first performed it in 2014.

==Production==

The original production was directed by Katie Mitchell; designer Chloe Lamford’s incorporated &quot;swirling video images behind him that illustrate Rapley’s arguments and have a strange beauty of their own&quot;. The videos were done by Luke Halls, and Paul Clark composed music for the production. The production was done jointly with the &quot;Deutsches Schauspielhaus&quot; in Hamburg, Germany. In December, 2014, it was presented there in English with German subtitles added.

A short-run production was mounted in August 2019 at the Episcopal Actors Guild in New York, with actor Robert Meksin as Rapley, directed by Carin Zakes, to benefit 350.org.

==Reviews==

Reviewing the play, Michael Billington, theatre critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 1971, wrote &quot;if we look to theatre to increase our awareness of the human condition, the evening succeeds on all counts&quot;. Some reviewers were less enthusiastic, with Aleks Sierz writing, &quot;Why is the Royal Court hosting such devised work, and not commissioning playwrights to create new metaphor-rich plays about this subject?&quot;

==Publication==

In 2015, the script of the play was published in England with the title &quot;2071: The World We’ll Leave Our Grandchildren&quot;, and a translation into German, &quot;2° Grad&quot;, was published in Germany.

<doc id="782741" wikidata="Q493302" url="?curid=782741" title="Hizb ut-Tahrir">
<text>Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT; ) is an international pan-Islamist and Islamic fundamentalist political organization whose stated aim is the re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate to unite the Muslim community (called &quot;ummah&quot;) and implement sharia globally.

Hizb ut-Tahrir was founded in 1953 as a political organization in then-Jordanian-controlled Jerusalem by Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, a Palestinian Islamic scholar from Haifa who was educated in Egypt and served as a &quot;qadi&quot; (religious court judge) in Mandatory Palestine. He formulated a program and a &quot;draft constitution&quot; for the establishment of a Caliphate. The organization sees world history as an eternal conflict between Islam and non-believers, with the state system considered a historical assault on Islam. The group views Jihad as an essential aspect of its vision and considers it an imperative duty aimed at combating disbelief until all submit to Islamic rule, making no distinction between the violent and spiritual dimensions of Jihad. As an initial step, HT directs attention to the &#x27;near enemy&#x27;, advocating the removal of rulers &quot;pretending to be Muslims&quot;, a step they consider a prerequisite for the global spread of Islam.

Since 1953, Hizb ut-Tahrir has spread to more than 50 countries, and has a membership estimated to be between &quot;tens of thousands&quot; to &quot;about one million&quot;. Hizb ut-Tahrir is active in Western countries, including the UK, and also in several Arab and Central Asian countries despite being banned by some governments. Members typically meet in small private study circles, but in countries where the group is not illegal, it also engages with the media and organizes rallies and conferences. The organization&#x27;s leadership is centered in Jordan, with additional headquarters in London. This dual presence leverages the relative freedom in Europe to oversee activities in Muslim nations where HT faces more stringent restrictions.

Hizb ut-Tahrir has been banned in Bangladesh, China, Russia, Pakistan, India, Germany, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Kazakhstan and &quot;across Central Asia&quot;, Indonesia, and all Arab countries except Lebanon, Yemen and the UAE. In July 2017, the Indonesian government revoked Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s legal status, citing incompatibility with government regulations on extremism and national ideology.

==Goals, methods, and organization==

Hizb ut-Tahrir states its aim as unification of all Muslim countries (or as it calls them &quot;Islamic lands&quot;) over time in a unitary Islamic state or caliphate, headed by a caliph elected by Muslims. This, it holds, is an obligation decreed by God, warning that Allah will punish those Muslims &quot;who neglect this duty&quot;. Once established, the caliphate will expand into non-Muslim areas, through &quot;invitation&quot; and through military jihad, so as to expand the &quot;land of Islam&quot; and diminish the &quot;land of unbelief&quot;. To &quot;achieve its objective&quot; HT seeks &quot;to gain the leadership of the Islamic community&quot; so that the community will &quot;accept it as her [the community&#x27;s] leader, to implement Islam upon her and proceed with it in her struggle against the &quot;Kuffar&quot; (unbelievers) and in the work towards the return of the Islamic State&quot;.

The nature of the &quot;Islamic state&quot;/caliphate/khilafah is spelled out in a detailed program and &quot;draft constitution&quot; which notes the caliphate being a unitary (not federal) state, run by a &quot;caliph&quot; head of state elected by Muslims. Other specified features include: &quot;The currency of the State is to be restricted to gold and silver&quot;—article 163; &quot;every male Muslim, fifteen years and over, is obliged to undergo military training&quot;—article 56; &quot;Arabic is the language of Islam and the sole language of the State&quot;—article 8; in marriage the wife is &quot;obliged to obey her husband&quot; and the husband &quot;to provide&quot;—article 116, in schools &quot;the weekly lessons of Islamic disciplines and Arabic language must be equal to the lessons of all other sciences in terms of number and time&quot;—article 173. Such things as copyrights on educational materials (article 175), military treaties (article 185), and memberships by the state in secular international organizations (article 186) are forbidden by the constitution. In addition to the constitution, &quot;many detailed books&quot; expand on the HT ideology and &quot;method of work&quot;, according to its 2010 Information pack.

Although &quot;hizb&quot; means party in Arabic, in the countries where Hizb ut-Tahrir is active it has not registered as a political party or attempted to elect candidates to political office, although it did early in its history. Hizb ut-Tahrir put forward candidates for office in Jordan in the 1950s when it was first formed and before it was banned, according to Suha Taji-Farouki. Kyrgyz Hizb ut-Tahrir members campaigned unsuccessfully for an affiliated candidate in Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s national presidential election in July 2005, and have participated in municipal elections where their followers have won in a number of regions.

Olivier Roy describes the strategy as a &quot;global, grassroots revolution, culminating in a sudden, millenarian victory&quot;, as opposed to a slog through a political process &quot;that risks debasing the Koran and perpetuating the ummah&#x27;s subjugation to the West&quot;.

The party plans its political progress in three stages, taking after the process &quot;by which the Prophet Muhammad established the Caliphate in thirteen years&quot;. According to an analyst of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Kazakhstan, where the group is outlawed: &quot;First they convert new members. Secondly, they establish a network of secret cells, and finally, they try to infiltrate the government to work to legalize their party and its aims.&quot; A more sympathetic description of this strategy is that Hizb ut-Tahrir works to:
# Establish groups of elite citizens as a community of Hizb ut-Tahrir members who carry the &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; to Muslim societies to support an Islamic state. Members should accept the goals and methods of the organization as their own and be ready to work to fulfill these goals. (This process of building a party attempts to copy Muhammad&#x27;s work in Mecca where he built a core of supporters.)
# Build public opinion among the Muslim masses for the caliphate and the other Islamic concepts that will lead to a revival of Islamic thought. (This process of what the party calls &quot;intellectual transformation through political and cultural interaction&quot;, attempts to imitate Muhmmad&#x27;s using his core of supporters to win over the population of Mecca and later Medina.) &quot;Stage two involves penetration into government positions and military special forces&quot;, according to HT critic Zeyno Baran. For some members this will involve &quot;drink[ing] alcohol and chang[ing] their behavior in other ways to blend in with secular elites&quot;. 
# The government would be replaced by one that implements Islam &quot;generally and comprehensively&quot;, carrying Islamic thought to people throughout the world.

HT has for many years made use of the Internet to propagate its message. It changes messages frequently, and uses a number of languages. As of 2004, there were at least seven websites related directly to HT.

HT talks about a &quot;bloodless&quot; coup, or &quot;nussrah&quot;, for the facilitation of &quot;a change of the government&quot;. In one document (&#x27;Our Method&#x27;), it states, &quot;we consider that Islamic law forbids violence or armed struggle against the regime as a method to reestablish the Islamic State.&quot; A 2004 report by the Nixon Center states that &quot;credible reports&quot; indicate that HT members have been &quot;involved in coup attempts in Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Iraq&quot;. According to HT, once one or more Muslim countries come under the organization&#x27;s control (such as Pakistan, Indonesia or a country in Central Asia) this will create a base; subsequently, other Muslim countries will be convinced to join and a &quot;domino effect&quot; will be created to establish a new caliphate.

Researchers and scholars have described HT as a vanguard party (David Commins and Zeyno Baran) or as seeming to be &quot;less interested in a broad mass following than a smaller more committed core of members&quot; (BBC). The &quot;About Us&quot; section of the Hizb ut-Tahrir official website states &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir is determined to work within the Ummah in order to implement Islam and achieve its objective by endeavouring to gain the leadership of the Islamic Ummah so that she could accept it as her leader, to implement Islam upon her and proceed with it in her struggle against the Kuffar&quot;. But according to a former leader in the UK, Jalaluddin Patel, once the caliphate has been established, HT &quot;will never assume the role of a vanguard party&quot;.

In countries where the party is outlawed, Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s organization is said to be strongly centralized, with its central leadership based in the Palestinian Territories. To avoid infiltration by security agents and maintain ideological coherence in a pyramid-like group, the party enforces internal discipline and obedience to the central leadership. The party &quot;tolerates no internal dissent&quot;. A range of disciplinary measures are applied to members who break the rules, with expulsion being the most severe. The network of underground cells resembles that of the successful Bolshevik revolutionaries in Russia. At the top is the central committee (&quot;lajnat al-qiyada&quot;) of the international party, and the supreme leader (&quot;Amir&quot;). The main committee or agency is tasked with taking power to re-establish the caliphate by establishing contacts with &quot;the centers of power such as the army and the political leaders&quot;. This agency is &quot;the most secretive&quot;, and &quot;reports directly&quot; to the &quot;Amir&quot;.

Organizationally below its center are national organizations or &quot;wilayas&quot; (which actually means &quot;province&quot; since HT believes that nation states are un-Islamic; the only &quot;nation&quot; is the Islamic community), &quot;usually headed by a group of 12, control networks of local committees and cells&quot;. &quot;Wilayas&quot; have an executive committee charged with managing administrative affairs which is elected every two years by the membership of the party in the &quot;wilaya&quot;. At the provincial level, there is a committee headed by a provincial representative (&quot;Mu&#x27;tamad&quot;) who oversees group activities. The &quot;Mu&#x27;tamad&quot; is appointed by the central committee.

The basic unit of the party is a cell of five members, the leader of which is the &quot;mushrif&quot;. The &quot;mushrif&quot; leads a study-circle, teaches HT ideology, and organizes readings from books by Nabhani, particularly &quot;Nidham al-Islam&quot;, or &quot;the System of Islam&quot;, which lay out his
vision of an &#x27;Islamic&#x27; state&quot; and refutes other Arab political ideologies. Where the party is not legal, only the &quot;mushrif&quot; knows the names of members of other cells. A candidate for membership swears an oath of loyalty (&quot;qasam&quot;)

According to one study, little is known of how HT funds its activities thanks to the party&#x27;s &quot;clandestine &quot;modus operandi&quot;&quot;. In Western countries, members who have jobs contribute part of their income, possibly as much as 10 percent. In Muslim countries funding may or may not come from Iran, the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia.

Because it is banned in most Muslim-majority countries but legal throughout Western countries, the group differs from most Salafi organizations in being &quot;more self-conscious, adaptive and sensitive to Western culture&quot; despite its resolute opposition to that culture.

HT has been called &quot;secretive and hierarchical&quot; by a former member. It uses &quot;cover names for reserving venues, publishing propaganda and even carrying out political activity&quot; even where it is legal. At least one former member has complained that the HT &quot;party philosophy&quot; and practice of referring to its study groups as &quot;halaqa&quot;—despite the fact they are studying leader Nabhani&#x27;s writings and not the Quran—makes Nabhani&#x27;s work &quot;synonymous with the Quran&quot;, and that &quot;the cult-like structure of the organisation [makes] this difficult&quot; for young recruits to see. While one media pack published by HT emphasizes that membership &quot;is open to all Muslim men and women regardless of their nationality, race or school of thought&quot;, critics complain of the party&#x27;s need for &quot;absolute, unequivocal acceptance of the Movement&#x27;s dogma&quot;, its ignoring of spiritual aspects of Islam, and discouraging of free airing of views or &quot;challenging statements&quot;.

The party principle of overthrowing existing Muslim governments has been questioned as a violation of the ayah:

This is supported by &quot;several notable scholars&quot;—according to Mateen Siddiqui—such as Ibn Nujaym, Al-Bahjouri, and Abu Hanifa. Critics also note a pattern of &quot;a brief spell of support&quot; followed by &quot;failure to take power&quot; in HT&#x27;s more than 50 years of agitation.

==Positions and policies==

The party has been described as being &quot;centralised&quot; in leadership and strategy, with its ideology based on the writings of its deceased founder al-Nabhani. Because these principles have been in place since the party&#x27;s founding, they are therefore considered unlikely to change. The party itself claims its &quot;ideology and its method of work&quot; has been &quot;meticulously thought out and published in many detailed books&quot;. Prospective HT members study the &quot;core books&quot; of HT in preparation for being accepted as members. Hizb ut-Tahrir websites, speeches, etc. also detail party positions.

Critics have pointed out differences between party texts and public statements and accused HT of varying its &quot;message to suit different audiences&quot;, or of attempting to &quot;soften&quot; its public image (by deleting pamphlets from its website and other means), &quot;as a defensive reaction to increased scrutiny&quot;, while leaving its original strategy and ideology untouched. HT itself claims there is &quot;a lot of ... propaganda and disinformation&quot; about the party and the caliphate being spread by enemies to &quot;demonise&quot; HT.

===Draft Constitution===

The HT Draft Constitution or &quot;proposed constitution&quot;, which contains many party positions, has been described by one party leader, Jalaluddin Patel, as &quot;the sum of all the work and research&quot; the party has &quot;done in this field&quot;, &quot;based on &quot;Ijtihad&quot;&quot;, interpretations of Islamic texts and traditions, schools of &quot;fiqh&quot; and individual scholars (including Shi&#x27;a) and consultation with &quot;various Islamic groups around the world&quot;. Patel also told Jamestown that if &quot;the future Caliph&quot; is not a member of HT, the party will offer the constitution to him as a &quot;working document&quot; which he can &quot;accept, amend or indeed reject in favor of his own opinion and Ijtihad (interpretation)&quot;.

===Khilafah/Caliphate and Islam===
====Caliphate====
Hizb ut-Tahrir texts and websites hold that re-establishing the Khilafah state or Caliphate based on sharia law has been decreed by God as the &quot;most important&quot; obligation of Muslims, who will be punished if they neglect it. Without the caliphate and true sharia law, Muslims have been living in a state of &quot;jahiliyya&quot; (pre-Islamic ignorance). &quot;Not a single country or state&quot; has escaped jahilayya and unbelief, including ones that consider themselves to be Islamic states, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. These and all other Muslim-majority states and polities—Kurds, Turks, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.—serve as &quot;agents&quot; of a non-Muslim power—usually of the United States—and, their anti-American rhetoric and policies and their fighting amongst each other notwithstanding, they are actually &quot;working harmoniously within US policy&quot;.

One HT website (HT Britain) states that the Caliphate &quot;dominated 95% of Islamic history&quot; as a &quot;stable, independent, accountable and representative state&quot;, and that the party goals of unifying all Islamic countries into a single Islamic state where sharia law is strictly applied have strong support in the Muslim world. The caliphate will bring stability, the party argues: by providing a political system that is &quot;accountable&quot; and a ruler who is legitimized by virtue of elected representation; by returning the Muslim world to Islamic practice and traditional readings of Islamic values and history; and by virtue of it being &quot;the only institution able to provide credible leadership on Islamic issues and for Muslims&quot;.

The ruler of the caliphate, the Caliph (or &quot;Khaleefah&quot;), should be elected, not chosen through blood lines or imposed on Muslims, according to the Hizb ut-Tahrir Draft Constitution, and should take a pledge of loyalty (&quot;ba&#x27;iah&quot;) to the Muslim community following his election. The Muslim community would have &quot;no right to dismiss him after he has legitimately attained the &quot;ba&#x27;iah&quot; of contracting&quot;.

HT sources (an HT &quot;Information Pack&quot; issued to British media by HT Britain circa 2010 and the HT Britain magazine &quot;New Civilisation&quot;) describe the ruler of the proposed caliphate as &quot;an elected and accountable ruler&quot; and a &quot;servant to the masses, governing them with justice&quot;, &quot;legitimate only through popular consent&quot;, who can be removed at the demand of the people through &quot;the independent judiciary&quot; of the caliphate, and whose judicial opinion on adopting a law does not prevent further debate and amendment. Along with &quot;an independent judiciary, political parties&quot; and the elected representative of the &quot;Majlis al-Umma&quot; (&quot;the council of the Muslim community&quot;, whose decisions are binding on the Caliph according to Nabhani&#x27;s book, &quot;Nethaam al-Huqm fil-Islam&quot;), the caliph rules a state that is uniquely representative, that will provide &quot;rule of law and equal rights for minority groups&quot;, and so bears no &quot;resemblance to a totalitarian state&quot;, criticism notwithstanding.

But critics complain that the HT draft constitution describes the Caliph as simply &quot;the State&quot;. The constitution states that the Caliph &quot;possesses all the powers and function of the State&quot;, appointing and dismissing the governors and assistants of all the provinces of caliphate, the directors of departments, the heads of the armed forces and the generals, the chief judge and most judges, &quot;who are all responsible to the &quot;Khaleefah&quot; [Caliph] and not to the &quot;Majlis al-Ummah&quot;&quot; (according to Article 35e of the constitution). The founder an-Nabhani, in his book &quot;the System of Islam&quot;, specifically notes that the &quot;shura&quot; (consultative) body of the caliphate (the &quot;Majlis al-Ummah&quot;), &quot;is for seeking the opinion and not for ruling&quot;, so that if the Caliph neglects the majlis &quot;he would be negligent, but the ruling system would still remain Islamic. This is because of the &quot;shura&quot; (consultation) in Islam. This is contrary to the parliamentary system in democracy.&quot;

There is also no limitation on the Khaleefah&#x27;s period in office, &quot;so as long as he abides by the sharia&quot;. Critics (Houriya Ahmed and Hannah Stuart of The Centre for Social Cohesion) complain that non-Muslims living the caliphate are not included among those giving &quot;popular consent&quot; nor able to serve in the government, while the judges ruling over any recall attempt of the caliph are appointed by him or by a judge (the Supreme Judge) who is appointed by the Caliph. Regarding debate and amendment of legal rulings of the caliph, articles 3 and 35a of the proposed constitution stipulate that they must be obeyed. One issue not open to &quot;popular consent&quot; or differing opinion (according to HT doctrine) is seceding from the Caliphate. According to the second Amir of the party, &quot;preventing the dismemberment of any country from the body of the Khilafah&quot; is imperative, &quot;even if&quot; it leads &quot;to several years of fighting and ... the killing of millions of Muslims&quot;.

====Islamic lands====
&quot;Islamic lands&quot; to make up the HT Caliphate include not only Muslim-majority countries but also Muslim-majority regions such as Xinjiang, the Caucasus, and Kazan (in Russia), even though they have been part of non-Muslim countries for many years; and states/regions which have had a non-Muslim majority population for many years such as northern India, East Timor, southern Spain, Sicily, Crimea, Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Myanmar and the Philippines—that were once &quot;ruled by Muslims under the authority of Islam&quot;.

HT founder an-Nabhani, explains that while some believe that a country &quot;whose population is of non-Muslims&quot;, like Spain, &quot;is not an Islamic country; ... This conclusion is false. ... because a country is deemed Islamic if it was once ruled by Islam or if the majority of its population is of Muslims.&quot; So that &quot;Spain is indeed an Islamic country&quot;.

====Expansion to non-Muslim lands====

Hizb ut-Tahrir sees the Caliphate as eventually replacing not only Muslim states but Western non-Muslim ones, but whether it calls for violence to achieve this is disputed. The HT &quot;Information Pack&quot; for the Britain Media states that &quot;the suggestion that Hizb ut-Tahrir will be permitted to engage in an armed struggle when the Caliphate re-emerges, is absolutely false&quot;, but Michael Whine quotes HT founder An-Nabhani urging Muslims to follow the example of the original Islamic empire attacking and conquering adjacent territory of Persia and the Byzantine Empire, noting &quot;what are we to say about the Ummah today; numbering more than one billion, ... She would undoubtedly constitute a front which would be stronger in every respect than the leading superpowers put together&quot;. Another HT text (&quot;The Ummah&#x27;s Charter&quot;, quoted by Ahmed and Stuart), states that the Caliphate &quot;must rise to declare &quot;Jihad&quot; against the &quot;Kuffar&quot; without any lenience or hesitation&quot;, and a HT pamphlet (quoted by Dave Rich) predicts, &quot;In the forthcoming days the Muslims will conquer Rome and the dominion of the &quot;Ummah&quot; of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his family) will reach the whole world and the rule of the Muslims will reach as far as the day and night. And the &quot;Dīn&quot; of Muhammad (saw) will prevail over all other ways of life including Western Capitalism and the culture of Western Liberalism&quot;.

====Criticism====
Among the criticisms of HT&#x27;s vision of the caliphate are historical inaccuracy and danger of violence involved in re-establishing the caliphate:
*The historical Abbasid and Ottoman caliphates were &quot;ignored or opposed by five of the civilizations [HT] seemed to think it had governed&quot; (legal historian Sadakat Kadri). 
*Eras of great Islamic cultural achievement occurred not under rulers who strictly applied Sharia, but &quot;under open-minded rulers whom the group would consider heretical: the Mu&#x27;tazilite caliphs and Shi&#x27;a sultans of the ninth and tenth-century Baghdad, for example and the eclectic emperors who emerged out of Anatolia, Persia, and central Asia after the Mongol invasions&quot; (Sadakat Kadri). 
*&quot;During its heyday&quot; the society of the Abbasid caliphate &quot;thrived on multiculturalism, science, innovation, learning and culture&quot;, not strict enforcement of sharia, and had famous free thinkers (Al-Maʿarri) and irreverent, impious poets (namely Abu Nuwas) (journalist Khaled Diab). 
* Rather than being protected and purified by the caliphate, the religion of Islam &quot;throughout Muslim history has operated as an alternative, in tension with the caliphate: it was a repository of ideals of justice and equity, and its purpose was to speak the truth to the vainglory of institutions of power&quot; (Ziauddin Sardar).
*It seems dubious that &quot;security, safety and peace in the Muslim world&quot; would come about &quot;through the forceful removal of all current Muslim governments&quot; in the creation of a unified caliphal state, especially in light of Abdul Qadeem Zallum&#x27;s statement in a &quot;party text&quot; that &quot;if necessary millions of Muslims and non-Muslims will be killed&quot;.

====Defence====

Responsibility for defense in Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s constitutional vision of the caliphate would go to the &quot;Amir al-Jihad&quot; who would be &quot;the supervisor and director&quot; of four governmental departments comprising &quot;the army, the police, equipment, tasks, armament supplies&quot;, internal security, foreign affairs, and industry (&quot;all factories of whatever type should be established on the basis of the military policy&quot;). The &quot;Amir al-Jihad&quot; does not serve as the commander-in-chief, who, along with his immediate subordinates, is appointed by the Caliph. Conscription is compulsory for all male Muslims 15 and over in the proposed state &quot;in readiness for jihad&quot;.

====Economy====

The draft constitution also details an economic system that allows private enterprise, but requires that &quot;the State&quot; should &quot;provide employment&quot; and &quot;basic needs&quot; for its citizens. To provide for this the state will draw from &quot;permanent&quot; sources of income from special taxes on non-Muslims: spoils or &quot;fei″&quot; (spoils of &quot;jihad&quot; when the non-Muslim enemy has surrendered or fled), &quot;jizyah&quot; (a poll tax on non-Muslims), and &quot;kharaj&quot; (land conquered from non-Muslims in jihad). It also includes a &quot;tax&quot; of one/fifth of discovered buried treasure (&quot;rikaaz&quot;) and &quot;zakaah&quot; (annual Islamic charitable donation of 2.5% of a Muslim&#x27;s total savings and wealth excluding a minimum amount) and other taxes if necessary.

The constitution also reserves public ownership of utilities, public transport, health care, energy resources such as oil, and unused farm land. Constitutionally forbidden activities include: &quot;squandering, extravagance and miserliness&quot;, &quot;capitalist companies, co-operatives&quot;, usury (&quot;riba&quot;), &quot;fraud, monopolies, gambling and the like&quot;, leasing of land for agriculture, and the failure of a land owner to use their land (such as leaving land fallow for more than three years). For monetary policy, the constitution calls for use of the Gold Standard, and gold and silver coinage.

Outsider observers have called HT&#x27;s economic proposals &quot;very vague&quot; (International Crisis Group), or lacking in coherence (Ahmed &amp; Stuart, Zeyno Baran). Former HT UK leader Jalaluddin Patel defends it, writing that &quot;the Islamic economic system comes from the Creator&quot;, who has &quot;better insight into the human condition than humans&quot;.

====Jihad====
HT texts define Jihad as &quot;war undertaken for the sake of Allah (swt) to raise high His (swt) word&quot; and requiring an army (&quot;Institutions of State in the Khilafah&quot;). They declare the necessity of jihad so that &quot;Da&#x27;wah&quot; will be carried &quot;to all mankind&quot; and will &quot;bring them into the Khilafah state&quot;, and the importance of declaring &quot;Jihad against the &quot;Kuffar&quot; without any lenience or hesitation&quot; (&quot;Ummah&#x27;s Charter&quot;), as well as the need to fight unbelievers who refuse to be ruled by Islam, even if they pay tribute (&quot;The Islamic Personality&quot;).

On the other hand, public statements by Hizb ut-Tahrir deny this by saying &quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir will be permitted to engage in an armed struggle when the Caliphate re-emerges, ... The party is not waiting for any order to begin an &#x27;armed struggle.

Other HT texts differ over whether jihad is by nature offensive rather than defensive (supported in &quot;The Inevitability of the Clash of Civilisations&quot;), or encompasses both &quot;defensive and offensive war&quot; (supported on a different page of &quot;The Inevitability of the Clash of Civilisations&quot;). Statements also conflict as to whether offensive jihad must wait for the caliphate to be established (as the head of HT Britain, Jalaluddin Patel, told an interviewer in 2004), or requires only an &quot;amir&quot; to lead Muslims (&quot;Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; pamphlet). The party does support &quot;defensive jihad&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan against American occupation—defensive jihad not requiring the &quot;appropriate political and military capabilities&quot; of an Islamic State, it need not wait for either a caliph or amir.

====Shariah====
Along with the establishment of an Islamic State, Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s other main principle/objective is the enforcement of shariah law to regulate all aspects of human life— politics, economics, sciences, and ethics. The law will be based upon fair interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an, the Sunnah, consensus of the companions (&quot;Ijma al-Sahaba&quot;), and legitimate analogies (&quot;Qiyas&quot;) drawn from those three sources. The Islamic state will not &quot;adopt a particular&quot; Madhhab (school of fiqh). According to Forum 18 News Service, it was told by an HT representative that &quot;the only true Muslims&quot; are those who adhere to one of the four Sunni madhhabs, and &quot;those who depart&quot; the four &quot;would be considered as apostates and liable to punishment according to Islamic law&quot;.

Regarding traditional hudud penal code, the HT text &quot;Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir&quot; describes their abandonment as part of the &quot;misinterpret[ation of] the Islamic rules to adapt them to contemporary life&quot; that started in the late 19th century. In a HT video on how Muslims should answer criticism of the &quot;harsh&quot; punishments of &quot;hudud&quot;, HT member Taji Mustafa argues chopping off hands and feet &quot;are a huge deterrent&quot; to crime. HT texts state adultery should be punished by stoning and pre-marital sex by lashing, and apostasy from Islam by death. &quot;Brigandage&quot; and murder would be punished by execution, crucifixion or amputation. That use of the punishments of &#x27;chopping off&#x27; of hands for theft and stoning to death for adultery would become law in the HT caliphate was confirmed in a 2009 interview of Tayyib Muqeem, an HT leader.

Non-Muslims would be subject to the same laws and in addition would be subject to special taxes—the poll tax of jizya and the land tax of Kharaj. Men and women are to be segregated in public except when absolutely necessary according to HT Draft Constitution. A women&#x27;s body may not be revealed, &quot;apart from her face and hands&quot;. This was also reaffirmed by HT leader Tayyib Muqeem in a 2009 interview – &quot;Every woman would have to cover up.&quot; (See below for regulations for non-Muslims and women.)

According to founder an-Nabhan, one of the benefits of the caliphate is that in its court system, there has never been &quot;even one case ... settled according to other than the Islamic Shari&#x27;ah rules&quot;, although this is disputed by historians.

Unlike many court systems the caliphate would have no courts of appeal or cessation. &quot;If the judge pronounced a sentence, it would become binding, and the sentence of another judge would not under any circumstances reverse it.&quot; (However, if circumstantial evidence changed, a judge could reverse a decision.)

====Punishment for apostasy====

In the HT Draft Constitution, Article 7 declares that Muslims who &quot;have by themselves renounced Islam ... are guilty of apostasy (ridda) from Islam are to be executed&quot;. At least one HT text (&quot;How the Khilafah was Destroyed&quot; written by Abdul Qadeem Zallum, HT global leader from 1977 to 2003) emphasizes the importance of the &quot;rule of Shariah&quot; calling for the killing of apostates from Islam (those who have left Islam). Abdul Qadeem Zallum warns that the abolition of the caliphate in 1924 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a consequence of wayward Muslims like Atatürk no longer feeling any fear that they might be killed (since according to HT ending the caliphate was an act of apostacy). To prevent this from happening again, &quot;it is imperative to put back this issue in its rightful place and consider it to be a vital issue, by killing every apostate even if they numbered millions&quot;.

After several Western governments condemned this sentence, Hizb ut-Tahrir issued a statement affirming that &quot;the ruling of the Legislator, Allah the Almighty, for apostasy is death&quot; and that a Muslim should not &quot;seek the satisfaction of the hostile Kaffir West upon the descent of the Shar&#x27;i provision&quot;.

====Criticism====

Critics (Sardar, Kadri, Ahmed &amp; Stuart) complain that the &quot;particular sharia&quot; advocated by HT would contravene the standards and values of &quot;universal human rights&quot;, and &quot;was formulated in the ninth century and is frozen in history. Inherently violent towards women, minorities and criminals, it has never been willingly accepted by Muslims but always had to be forcibly imposed by authoritarian regimes&quot;. (While support for sharia is strong in the Muslim world, agreement over what constitutes sharia is less so.)

===Women===
The HT draft constitution states &quot;the primary role of a woman is that of a mother and wife. She is an honour (&#x27;ird) that must be protected.&quot; It declares that &quot;Women have the same rights and obligations as men, except for those specified by the shar&#x27;i evidences to be for him or her.&quot; These limitations include not being able to hold ruling positions such as caliph, chief justice, provincial governor, or mayor; being required to cover their body (except face and hands) in public; not being able travel without a male mahram, disobey her husband, or marry a non-Muslim. According to HT founder an-Nabhani, &quot;the husband performs all work undertaken outside of the house. The woman performs actions normally undertaken inside the house to the best of her ability.&quot; &quot;Segregation&quot; of the genders is &quot;fundamental&quot; in the HT constitution, and men and women should not meet together in private at all, or in public except in special shariah-approved activities such as trading or making Hajj pilgrimage.

Hizb ut-Tahrir forthrightly advocates women&#x27;s (i.e. Muslim women&#x27;s) suffrage or right to vote, the right of Muslim women to choose a (Muslim) partner freely, right to seek employment, serve in the military, have custody of children after divorce even if she is not Muslim, and run in elections (for positions that do not involve ruling over men).

While opponents may consider this unequal status, Hizb ut-Tahrir maintains:

In Australia, HT generated attention in its defense of the right of a 26-year-old man to marry a 12-year-old girl in an &#x27;Islamic ceremony&#x27; outside of Australian law (but with the girl&#x27;s father&#x27;s blessing), declaring that Australian law &quot;is not a basis for moral judgments. Something being illegal according to western law does not make it immoral&quot;.

HT sources differ over whether dress for women is not a matter of choice. At HTB&#x27;s 2003 annual conference, an HTB member warned the audience:

However, three years later, HT Britain signed a statement in support of &quot;a woman&#x27;s right to wear the veil&quot; as a &quot;human and religious right&quot;.

In the organization itself, women are thought to comprise 10% of HT&#x27;s membership, playing an &quot;active role&quot; in &quot;intellectual and political work&quot; such as conferences held by the UK women&#x27;s section of HT, and following a dress code of &quot;jilbab&quot; (a loose dress), &quot;Khimar&quot; (headscarf) and socks, so similar it has been compared to a &quot;uniform-like style&quot;.

===Capitalism, democracy, freedoms, and pluralism===
====Capitalism====
&quot;Capitalism&quot; is defined by HT as a political system of democracy and freedom (a definition many critics of HT regard as risible), not just as an economic system based on private ownership, and is frequently condemned by the party. Freedom of ownership is one of capitalism&#x27;s freedoms, along with freedom of belief and opinion and &quot;personal freedom&quot;. Capitalism is based on the idea of &quot;the separation of religion from life&quot;, and supported by the &quot;pillars&quot; of democracy, &quot;pluralism&quot; (the recognition and affirmation of diversity and peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions and lifestyles), &quot;human rights and free market policies&quot;. Another facet of &quot;Capitalism&quot; opposed by the party is the Western concept of &quot;compromise&quot;—an example of its un-Islamic nature is the proposed compromise solution of allowing both Jews and Muslims to have a state in Palestine. Critics complain HT has invoked &quot;freedom of speech, tolerance, ... human rights and democracy&quot; when it was under threat of proscription in 2005. Like other Islamist groups, HT texts describe Islam as an alternative economic system to both capitalism and communism and superior to both.

====Democracy====
Hizb ut-Tahrir draws a distinction between giving &quot;authority&quot; to the people in government (which is Islamic) and giving &quot;sovereignty&quot; to the people (the essence of democracy and unIslamic). Because Western democracy gives not just authority but sovereignty to the people, it is &quot;deeply flawed&quot;—a &quot;&quot;Kufr&quot; system&quot; that violates sharia, is &quot;controlled by large corporations and largely indifferent to the needs of ordinary citizens&quot;. Democracy may also lead to &quot;moral laxity and sexual deviancy ... such abnormal and strange sexual practices&quot; as homosexuality and bestality.

Since &quot;whoever does not rule whatever Allah has revealed, denying Allah&#x27;s right to legislate&quot; is a &quot;kafir&quot; (unbeliever), self-identified Muslims who believe in democracy are actually unbelievers—including former Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who will be &quot;thrown in hell fire for his apostasy and deviation from the &quot;deen&quot; of Allah&quot; (according to one HT pamphlet). One revivalist Muslim opponent of the HT position on boycotting elections in Western democracies, Mir Amir Ali, argued that numerous Muslim revivalist organizations had &quot;decided that it was in the best interests of Muslims in America and Muslims worldwide to participate in politics without creating a political party&quot;, after seeking &quot;guidance from renowned Islamic scholars from all over the world&quot;.

====Rights or freedoms====
Regarding other aspects of &quot;Capitalism&quot; condemned by HT—&quot;Pluralism&quot;, &quot;Human Rights&quot;, and the Freedoms of Belief, Expression, Ownership, and Personal Freedom—the 1996 HT work, &quot;The American Campaign to Suppress Islam&quot;, argues that while &quot;many Muslims are attracted&quot; to the slogan of &quot;human rights ... because of the oppression, torture, and persecution they suffer from their rulers&quot;, these rights are based on the Capitalist ideology&#x27;s view of the nature of man as &quot;inherently good&quot;, when in fact man is good when he obeys God&#x27;s law and bad when he does not.

Muslims who claim that the freedom of belief does not contradict Islam are among the &quot;trumpets of the &quot;Kuffar&quot;&quot; (unbelievers). It warns that a Muslim who calls for human rights is either a sinner (&quot;fajir&quot;) (if they do not realise the contradiction between &quot;human rights&quot; and Islam), or a &quot;Kafir&quot; (unbeliever) (if they believe in human rights &quot;as an idea emanating from the detachment of &quot;deen&quot; from life&quot;). (Muslims who &quot;have by themselves renounced Islam ... are guilty of apostasy (&quot;ridda&quot;) from Islam are to be executed&quot; according to Article 7 of the HT Draft Constitution.)

American-based academic David Commins writes that, &quot;within well-recognized bounds, the Muslim enjoys much freedom&quot; under HT&#x27;s hypothetical caliphate. The HT constitution also include rights such as assumption of innocence until proven guilty, due process, and a ban on torture. Should the caliphate violate its citizens&#x27; rights, however, critics note that those citizens would have no right to rebel, because shariah law (according to HT text &quot;The Ummah&#x27;s Charter&quot;) &quot;has urged obedience to those who assume authority over the Muslims, whatever injustice they committed and however much they violated the people&#x27;s rights.&quot;

====Pluralism====
Also opposed is pluralism, and the idea of &quot;multiple overlapping identities&quot; (such as someone being a &#x27;British Muslim&#x27;), which are an example of &quot;kufr&quot; (unbelief). In all its political actions HT works to &quot;purify&quot; the Islamic community from &quot;the effect of the kufr thoughts and opinions&quot;. HT has distributed pamphlets at mosques in Britain urging Muslims not to vote in elections for example (to the disapproval of other British Muslim organizations). In a pamphlet titled &quot;An Open Letter to the Muslims in Britain regarding the Dangerous Call of Integration&quot;, it warns that Integration into Western society and secularism are a way to &quot;keep Islam completely away from their lives such that nothing remains of it but spiritualistic rituals conducted in the places of worship and a few pages in books of history&quot;.

===Non-Muslims and the West===
====Non-Muslims====
Regarding non-Muslims living under Islam, the British HT media Information Pack describes its position as a &quot;matter of public record&quot;, and will follow the teachings of Muslims scholars who call for Muslims to &quot;take care of their [non-Muslim] weak, fulfil the needs of the poor, feed the hungry, provide clothes, address them politely&quot; and even &quot;tolerate their harm&quot; to Muslims. It also states that non-Muslims under Muslim rule for thirteen centuries &quot;enjoyed equal rights, prosperity, happiness, tranquillity and security&quot;&gt;

According to Media Spokesperson for Hizb ut-Tahrir UK and member of its executive committee, Taji Mustafa,

However, the Hizb ut-Tahrir draft constitution for its unified Islamic state forbids any non-Muslims living in the state to serve in any of the ruling offices, such as the position of caliph, or to vote for these officials. Muslims have &quot;the right to participate in the election of the Khaleefah [head of state] and in giving him the pledge (&quot;ba&#x27;iah&quot;). Non-Muslims have no right in this regard.&quot; However non-Muslims may voice &quot;complaints in respect to unjust acts performed by the rulers or the misapplication of Islam upon them&quot;.

Non-Muslims would be subject to the same laws and in addition would be subject to special taxes—the poll tax of &quot;jizya&quot; and the land tax of &quot;Kharaj&quot;. HT founder an-Nabhani explains that the taxes on Non-Muslims in the caliphate are a &quot;right that Allah enabled the Muslims to take from the &quot;Kuffar&quot; [disbelievers] as a submission from their part to the rule of Islam.&quot;

In regards to foreign policy, the draft constitution states that while &quot;it is permitted to conclude good neighbouring, economic, commercial, financial, cultural and armistice treaties&quot;, &quot;the State is forbidden to belong to any organisation that is based on something other than Islam or which applies non-Islamic rules&quot;. (It goes on to specify &quot;the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and regional organisations like the Arab League&quot;.)

Concerning relations with non-Muslim states following the establishment of the caliphate, one source (HT representatives talking to Forum 18 News Service) stated that &quot;all non-Muslim states&quot; would be given &quot;a choice between either joining the Caliphate under Sharia law, or paying a tax&quot;, but &quot;failure to pay the tax would be punished by military attacks&quot;.

However two other HT sources are less lenient, requiring submission to Islamic rule. One (known as &quot;Muqadimmat ul-Dustur aw asbab ul-Muwajjabbat lah&quot; or &quot;The Introduction to the Constitution or the Causes of its Obligation&quot;) noted those in the &quot;Dar al-Harb&quot; (&quot;House of War&quot;, i.e. outside of the HT Islamic State/Caliphate) are &quot;considered belligerent in government (&quot;muharibeen hukman&quot;)&quot;, even if &quot;we have a treaty with them&quot; or there are &quot;no actual hostilities (&quot;qital&quot;)&quot; with them. Those who Dar al-Islam has a treaty with &quot;are considered belligerent&quot; (&quot;muharibeen&quot;, lit. warring people) because they &quot;are infidels (&quot;kuffar&quot;) and they do not submit to the authority of Islam&quot;—a position the Quilliam Foundations questions in a title &quot;Islamism is peace or we declare war on you&quot;. Another work (&quot;The Islamic Personality&quot;, Vol. 2,) says concerning non-Muslim states, &quot;[I]f they accepted to pay the &quot;jizyah&quot; but refused to be ruled by Islam, it is not allowed to accept this from them because the cause of fighting – which is that they are disbelievers who have refused to accept the &quot;da’wah&quot; – remains standing so fighting them remains obligatory&quot;.

In the &quot;About Us&quot; section of the English language section of its &quot;Official Website&quot; (as of 9 February 2016), HT lists &quot;Exposing the plans and the conspiracies of the &quot;Kuffar&quot; [unbelievers]&quot;, as one of the four &quot;actions&quot; it &quot;undertakes&quot;. Some researchers (such as David Zeidan) have noted how HT founder Nabhani emphasised (what he believed) was the hatred of the west towards Islam, where European colonialism was (he believed) simply a continuation of the Crusades:

====The West====

Western capitalistic states, led by the United States, are the &quot;most vicious enemies&quot; of Islam according to HT. Hizb ut-Tahrir sees Western influence as the cause of stagnation in the Muslim world, the reason for its failure to re-establish the caliphate thus far, and something in need of being attacked and uprooted. The Australian HT Media Pack describes Western governments as &quot;the major obstacle to positive change in the Muslim World&quot;. Founder Nabhani has been described (by David Commins) as preaching that &quot;British plots in particular and western imperialist conspiracies in general pervade the modern history of the Muslim world and ultimately explain its main lines of political evolution.&quot; In his book,&quot;The System of Islam,&quot; which is studied by all Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Nabhani states:

According to the same book, the Muslim world fell behind the West (or other non-Muslim societies) not because it failed to borrow some political, cultural, or social concepts these civilizations had to offer, but because it did:

Western intellectual and cultural influence as well as its political and economic influence must be &quot;uprooted&quot; from the Muslim community. According to late HT global emir Abdul Qadeem Zallum, &quot;The fierce struggle between the Islamic thoughts and the Kufr thoughts, ... will continue ... – a bloody struggle alongside the intellectual struggle – until the Hour comes and Allah (swt) inherits the Earth and those on it. This is why Kufr is an enemy of Islam, and this is why the &quot;Kuffar&quot; will be the enemies of the Muslims as long as there is Islam and Kufr in this world&quot;.

According to the HT work &quot;Dangerous Concepts&quot;, among the tools used by Kufr nations to &quot;finish off Islam by destroying its &quot;Aqeedah&quot; (creed) as a political Aqeedah&quot; are such activities as &quot;inter-faith and intercultural dialogues, and the viewpoint that both the Arab and Jewish races are the sons of Abraham.&quot;

Regarding the activity of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Western countries, HT texts emphasize the necessity of Muslims choosing between an Islamic identity and a Western one. A British HT media Information Pack states that it opposes assimilation in Western countries by Muslims but also &quot;isolation&quot;. The party claims it &quot;works to cultivate a Muslim community that ... adher[s] to the rules of Islam and preserv[es] a strong Islamic identity&quot;; to &quot;project a positive image of Islam&quot; and &quot;engages in dialogue with Western thinkers, policymakers and academics&quot;, but &quot;does not work ... to change the system of government&quot;. However, HT founder An-Nabhani writing in his book &quot;The Islamic Personality, Vol. 2&quot;, stresses that the need to fight &quot;kufr&quot; extends to Muslims living outside the land of Islam (&quot;Dar al-Islam&quot;). In a land &quot;ruled by kufr&quot; where disbelievers &quot;reside&quot;, the Muslim &quot;is obliged ... to fight its people until they become Muslims or pay the jizyah and be ruled by Islam&quot;. In fact, unless he is not &quot;able to manifest his &quot;deen&quot; [i.e. his religion] and perform the requested Shar&#x27;a rules&quot;, the Muslim is forbidden to leave &quot;Dar al-Kufr&quot; (land of unbelief) and return to &quot;Dar al-Islam&quot;, as this would be &quot;fleeing from the jihad&quot;. Critics (Ahmed &amp; Stuart) complain that this amounts to a call for Western Muslims to &quot;fight&quot; their country&#x27;s (non-Muslim) &quot;people&quot;, and demonstrates &quot;the internal contradiction&quot; between HT&#x27;s avowed &quot;nonviolent&quot; political ideology and its plans for subversion and violent jihad to eventually expand its proposed caliphate into non-Muslim lands.

Although in public pronouncements the party has criticised the 9/11 and 7/7 terror attacks, it has declared the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; to be not just overreach or arrogant disregard for Muslim lives, but a &quot;disguise&quot; for a &quot;ruthless campaign against Islam and Muslims&quot;.

====United States====
The &quot;head of Kufr (unbelief)&quot; is the United States and its international domination &quot;a danger to the world&quot; which &quot;only the Khilafah can save&quot; it from, according to HT statements.

Attacks on Muslims, whether they be arrest and torture in Uzbekistan, executions in China, or attacks by Hindu mobs in India, are actually &quot;orchestrated and sanctioned by the head of Kufr, America&quot;. Although it has its &quot;agents&quot; in power throughout the Muslim world, the US is using capitalism (i.e. &quot;Democracy, pluralism, human rights and free market policies&quot;), to suppress Islam&quot;, as it fears the revival of Islam and &quot;the return&quot; of &quot;the Khilafah State&quot;, which will &quot;destroy&quot; US influence and interests not only over the Muslim world but &quot;over the whole globe&quot;.

A religious leader of HT, Imam Ismat Al-Hammouri, called for the destruction of the United States, France, Britain, and Rome, in a 2013 sermon.

One observer (Zeyno Baran) has argued that statements by US President George W. Bush (the war on terrorism is a &quot;crusade&quot;, &quot;you are either with us or against us&quot;)) and at least one US military leader (U.S. Army Lt. General Jerry Boykin: &quot;I knew my God is bigger than [Osama bin Laden&#x27;s&quot;]), and actions such as killings of civilians in the War in Iraq, have alarmed many Muslims and played into the HT message.

===Zionism===
Hizb ut-Tahrir strongly opposes Zionism and the existence of the state of Israel, or any compromise or peaceful relations with that state. According to scholar David Commins, the &quot;liberation of Palestine&quot; from Israel was the original &quot;primary concern&quot; of Hizb ut-Tahrir, with the project of setting up a unitary &quot;Islamic state that would revive the &#x27;true&#x27; Islamic order throughout the Muslim world coming later.&quot; According to scholar Suha Taji-Farouki, &quot;while in theory the issue of Israel and the Jews remains peripheral to [HT&#x27;s] main efforts, the party has consistently addressed it throughout its career&quot;.

In the 1990s, Ata Abu Rashta (HT&#x27;s current global leader and former spokesman) proclaimed that &quot;peaceful relations with the Jews&quot; or settling &quot;for only part of Palestine&quot; (such as the post-1967 territory of the West Bank and Gaza) is &quot;prohibited by Islamic Law&quot;. &quot;None of the Jews in Palestine who arrived after the destruction of the Ottoman Empire have the right to remain there. The Islamic legal rule requires that those of whom are capable of fighting be killed until none survive&quot;. Later statements by HT spokespersons also emphasize the importance of Islamic control of every part of Palestine (Taji Mustafa in 2008) and rejecting negotiation in favor of military Jihad (Imran Wahid, January 2009)

Another source describes HT as supporting the &quot;destruction of Israel&quot;, but seeing this as the job of the Caliphate, which must be founded first for this to take place.

Hizb ut-Tahrir has used the term &quot;one-state solution&quot; for the Israel/Palestine dispute (&quot;Palestine – why only a one state solution will work&quot;). This refers not to a binational solution (usually thought of in that context), where the &quot;one state&quot; is a united Palestinian state with no official/state religion and equal rights for all religions, but rather to the proposed HT Islamic state/caliphate which would include Palestine and where everyone, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, would follow statutory shariah Islamic law.

====Charges of anti-semitism====
Charges of antisemitism against HT include the 1994 call by a British MP for it to be prosecuted for anti-semitism (among other charges); the guilty verdict of the HT spokesman in Denmark for distributing &quot;racist propaganda&quot; (which included a quote from the Quran: &quot;And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out&quot;, followed by a passage stating: &quot;the Jews are a people of slander ... a treacherous people&quot;); its banning from public activity in Germany in 2003 by a German Interior Minister Otto Schily for what he called spreading violence and hate and calling for the killing of Jews; and a &quot;no platform&quot; order against the group by the British National Union of Students in 2004 for (what the NUS called) spreading antisemitic propaganda.

HT in return states that it rejects &quot;decisively&quot; the charge of anti-Semitism which, it says, arises from HT&#x27;s anti-Zionism, and it rejects it &quot;decisively&quot;. HT says the claim is &quot;ludicrous&quot; since &quot;there is a blood relation between Jews and Arabs&quot;.

Accusers cite a number of HT statements about the innate (negative) characteristics of Jews and the need and duty of Muslims to eradicate them. In a 2000 article entitled &quot;The Muslim Ummah will never submit to the Jews&quot;, Hizb ut-Tahrir lamented what it saw as the innate behavior of Jews:

(This or part of this statement was also found on a 2001 statement later removed from the Hizb ut-Tahrir website.)

A 2001 leaflet posted on HT website Khilafa.com and since removed condemns Arab and Muslim rulers for &quot;obstructing&quot; Muslims from their &quot;obligation&quot; of &quot;eradication of the Jews&quot;.

Party members have been accused of publicly denying the Holocaust, calling it a &quot;tool used by Jews to justify their own hegemony over Muslims in Palestine&quot;. In a 2003 interview with Forum 18 News Service, an Uzbekistani HT member &quot;expressed his regret that Hitler had not succeeded in eliminating all Jews&quot;. At the Hizb ut-Tahrir August 2007 annual conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, global head of Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ata Abu-Rishta is reported to have &quot;whipped the 100,000-strong crowd ... into a frenzy by calling for a war on Jews&quot;.

According to HT critics, labelling Muslims who &quot;do not adhere&quot; to HT positions &quot;Jews&quot; is &quot;not uncommon&quot; in HT. Self-identified Muslims alleged to be Jews by the party include Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish state who disbanded the Ottoman caliphate, and Islam Karimov, the authoritarian ruler of Uzbekistan who has reportedly detained HT members without charge or trial for lengthy periods, tortured them and subjected them to unfair trials).

Prior to the British House of Commons affirming the government&#x27;s designation of HT as a terrorist group in January 2024, Home Secretary James Cleverly said in a published statement that the group was an &quot;antisemitic organisation that actively promotes and encourages terrorism&quot;, citing instances of the group &quot;praising and celebrating the appalling 7 October attacks&quot;.

===Violence===
Hizb ut-Tahrir has been described as a &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;revolutionary&quot; but &quot;non-violent&quot;.

The party shares &quot;the same political objectives&quot; as radical Islamist groups like al-Qaeda (according to Zeyno Baran), and agrees with such groups that non-Muslims are waging war on Islam and Muslims, that leaders of Muslim countries are apostates from Islam who serve as agents of Western or other non-Muslim powers, and must be overthrown.

Hazel Blears, then UK Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, stated in February 2009 that HT &quot;falls short of openly advocating violence or terrorism&quot;.

In public statements for the British media, the party states that it &quot;has no history of violence or militancy anywhere in the world&quot;; that proof of their commitment is the number of members who &quot;have been imprisoned, tortured and even killed for their beliefs&quot;, but resisted resorting to violence; and that the party helps channel Muslim &quot;anger and frustration over events in the Muslim world towards positive political work&quot;.

On the other hand, opponents of the party have suggested that its opposition to violence is conditional, &quot;superficial&quot;, and far from complete. Critics argue: 
*that Hizb ut-Tahrir teaches that using violence against (what it declares) enemies of Islam is righteous and justified, &quot;but&quot; must follow a declaration of jihad by legitimate Islamic authority (such as the caliphate); 
*that it has urged and supported the use of violence against some non-Muslims in some circumstances (against Israel, against the US in Afghanistan, Iraq, against Hindus in Kashmir); 
*and/or that its positions &quot;justifying&quot; violence have led to violence and terrorism by young Muslims impatient for the return of the caliphate.

According to two scholars (Emmanuel Karagiannis and Clark McCauley), HT&#x27;s position on violence can be describe as either being &quot;committed to non-violence for fifty years&quot;, or &quot;waiting fifty years for the right moment to begin violent struggle&quot;.

Critics skeptical of HT&#x27;s nonviolence claims include Sadakat Kadri, ex-party member Hadiya Masieh, the British National Union of Students, and Zeyno Baran.

====Scriptural/Doctrinal basis of non-violence====

The British website of Hizb ut-Tahrir states that the party uses the methods &quot;employed by the Prophet Muhammad [who] limited his struggle for the establishment of the Islamic State to intellectual and political work. He established this Islamic state without resorting to violence.&quot;

Political scientist Emmanuel Karagiannis notes that &quot;after&quot; the establishment of an Islamic state in Medina, violence was resorted to. &quot;Jihad&quot; can lawfully be declared and violence and military force used (according to the party) once a true Islamic state is established. Karagiannis quotes HT: &quot;when the Messenger of Allah waged wars, they were not fought by individual ... rather they were fought by individuals who belonged to a state. Therefore, the army was an army that belonged to a state.&quot;

Researchers Houriya Ahmed and Hannah Stuart quote another HT critic (and former member of HTB&#x27;s national executive committee Maajid Nawaz), as saying that HT differs from some other Islamist jihadist groups in that rather than creating its own army for jihad, HT plans to &quot;use pre-existing militaries&quot;. An August 2008 HT conference in London ended its presentation with the statistic that the Islamic world has, &quot;4.7 million armed personnel – more than the USA, Europe and India combined.&quot; (Some (Zeyno Baran) have expressed skepticism of the HT doctrine that Muslim governments would be overthrown non-violently to create a new caliphate, given government officials&#x27; natural desire to stay in power and out of prison (or a firing squad), and the force of arms at their disposal to fight coup attempts. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several unsuccessful military coups by pro-HT factions were attempted in countries in the Middle East, and at least one (at the Military Technical College in Egypt) involved fatalities.)

Seven days after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hizb ut-Tahrir issued a statement that &quot;the rules&quot; of the Islamic prophet Muhammad &quot;message forbids any aggression against civilian non-combatants. They forbid killing of children, the elderly and non-combatant women even in the battlefield. They forbid the hijacking of civilian aeroplanes carrying innocent civilians and forbid the destruction of homes and offices that contain innocent civilians.&quot;

But a 1988 HT pamphlet stated that &quot;if the plane belongs to a country at war with the Muslims, like Israel, it is allowed to hijack it&quot;, and a June 2001 article in an online Arabic-language journal of the party argued in some detail that suicide bombings are justified in Islamic law—at least against Israelis – &quot;as long as the enemy unbeliever is killed&quot;. (HT sources have disagreed over whether the fight against non-Muslims perceived as attackers/occupiers in Muslim majority lands should wait for a caliphate, or is &quot;defensive jihad&quot; and so need not. )

There are also instances of the party calling for violence against specific targets: Karagiannis quotes an HT pamphlet as saying &quot;the martyrdom operations that are taking place against [the Jews] are legitimate. The whole of Palestine is a battlefield whether it is the parts usurped by the Jews in 1948, or afterwards.&quot;

In an August 2006 speech Ata Abu-Rishta, the global leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir, called for the &quot;destruction&quot; of Hindus living in Kashmir, Russians in Chechnya and Jews in Israel.

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks when the US invaded Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, HT issued a communique calling on the armies in the &quot;Islamic Ummah&quot; to wage war against the US and UK in retaliation for its &quot;waging war on Afghanistan&quot;. A 2008 HT press release called the reluctance of Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to &quot;fight a war with America&quot; &quot;shameful&quot;, citing Pakistan&#x27;s possession of &quot;nuclear weapons, missiles technology and half a million brave soldiers who are ready to attain martyrdom for Islam&quot;.

Hizb ut-Tahrir states that it &quot;has been on the public record on several occasions stating that in our Islamic opinion the killing of innocent civilians such as in the London bombings of 7th July 2005 and the attacks of September 11th 2001 are forbidden and prohibited.&quot; The British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir was among the many Muslim groups in Britain that condemned the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

Its spokesman did not initially condemn the attacks however, and the Terrorism Research Centre complained that the initial response to the London 7/7 bombings was &quot;to urge British Muslims to be strong in the face of an anticipated backlash&quot; and to attack G-8 world leaders for taking advantage of the London attacks &quot;to justify their &#x27;war on terror. Later statements asserted that &quot;American tyranny and arrogance has reached a level that led many to believe that the only way to dent her pride is to rub her nose in the sand&quot;, and that the &quot;U.S. and Great Britain declare war against Islam and Muslims&quot;.

====Justifying terrorism and the &quot;conveyor belt&quot;====
The possibility of re-establishing an Islamic superstate notwithstanding, critic James Brandon has called the &quot;real significance&quot; of the party &quot;likely&quot; to be its increasingly important role in &quot;radicalizing and Islamizing&quot; the Middle East, such as spreading ideas such as that the conflict between Western democracies and Islamists is an irresolvable and &quot;inevitable clash of civilizations, cultures and religions&quot;. Other critics warn that (they believe) the party is and/or will provide &quot;justification for the instigation of terrorism&quot; (Ahmed &amp; Stuart); &quot;paving the way for other, more militant groups to take advantage of the opening it has made&quot; (Zeyno Baran); spreading radical Islamist ideas to &quot;millions of Muslims&quot; through &quot;cyberspace, the distribution of leaflets, and secret teaching centres&quot; (Ariel Cohen); and in each country&#x27;s native language (Zeyno Baran).

Scholar Taji-Farouki writes that according to HT teachings Jews and Christians are disbelievers who have formed a &quot;united front against Muslims, and are engaged in a permanent effort to destroy Islam&quot;. Critics Ahmed and Stuart quote HT as describing the bombing of the Taliban by the US and UK as &quot;a brutal war against ... the defenceless Muslims&quot;, and the placing of the groups &quot;like&quot; Islamic Jihad, Hamas, al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya in Egypt (whose acts of resistance have killed numerous civilians)) &quot;on the list of terrorist organisations&quot;. as an example of the anti-Muslim wrongdoing by Westerners.

Others describe HT as &quot;entry level&quot; Islamism, or the first part of a &quot;conveyor belt&quot; (Zeyno Baran) for young Muslims that initiates a process leading to &quot;graduation&quot; (Shiv Malik) to violence. Zeyno Baran argues that Hizb ut-Tahrir safeguards its mission as &quot;an ideological and political training ground for Islamists&quot; by avoiding violence, and acting within &quot;the legal system of the countries in which it operates&quot;. Other organizations handle the planning and execution of terrorist attacks.

Baran argues that as members become &quot;impatience with the lack of success HT has had so far in overthrowing governments&quot;, they leave the party to create/join &quot;splinter groups&quot; less wedded to the idea that attacks on &quot;enemies of Islam&quot; must wait for a caliph. Baran lists four groups involving former HT members, the most noted being Omar Bakri Muhammad&#x27;s group Al-Muhajiroun. Bakri, Muhajiroun and/or its front groups desire to turn the UK into an Islamist state, have praised the 9/11 hijackers as &quot;magnificent&quot;, and bin Laden as &quot;a hero who stands for divine justice and freedom from oppression&quot;, claim to have recruited many young British Muslims for &quot;military service&quot; jihad in Afghanistan.

HT &quot;reject(s) the charge&quot; of &quot;incit[ing] others to commit violent acts&quot;, maintaining that there are &quot;many academics that reject the allegation&quot;. HT points out that the British government, in a classified report, discounted the conveyor belt theory, stating &quot;We do not believe that it is accurate to regard radicalisation in this country as a linear &#x27;conveyor belt&#x27; moving from grievance, through radicalisation, to violence ... This thesis seems to both misread the radicalisation process and to give undue weight to ideological factors.&quot; (In reply conservative columnist Andrew Giligan writes: &quot;In fact, at least 19 terrorists convicted in Britain have had links with al-Muhajiroun, including Omar Khayam, sentenced to life imprisonment as leader of the &#x27;fertiliser bomb&#x27; plot, and Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the ringleader of the airliner &#x27;liquid bomb&#x27; plot, who is also serving life.&quot;)

According to Michael Whine, a &quot;partial list&quot; of terrorists or accused terrorists &quot;who were also HT members and/or influenced by its teachings&quot; includes:
*In Britain: Faisal Moustafa, Shafihur Rehman and Iftikar Sattar, who in 1995 were arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate the Israeli ambassador, were reported to have been in possession of HT literature and to have helped organize HT meetings in Manchester. Omar Khan Sharif and Asif Hanif, the Mike&#x27;s Place suicide bombers, had contact with HT before moving on to more extreme organizations. Mohammad Babar, who is linked to the seven men currently on trial in London on charges of planning terrorist attacks between January 2003 and April 2004, has stated that he was a member of HT while in college. Imam Ramee, an American, spoke on behalf of HT while living in Manchester, and was the featured speaker at the HT-organized Muslim Unity Action March against the war in Iraq on 15 March 2003. He was reportedly an associate of Abu Hamza al-Masri, and is said to have preached to &quot;shoe bomber&quot; Richard Reid, along with Hanif and Sharif, at the North London Mosque in Finsbury Park.
*In Germany, HT leader Shaker Assem lectured to the 9/11 terrorists after one of the plot leaders, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, facilitated his introduction. 
*In Russia, HT leaders Alisher Musayev and Akram Dzahalolov were among 55 party members arrested in June 2003 for possession of plastic explosives, grenades, TNT, and detonators. In August 2005, 9 members were convicted of these offences and of incitement to racial hatred.Alexander Verkhovsky, 
*In Syria, the assassins of Syrian cleric Muhammed Amin Yakan, who after being reported to be mediating between the government and the banned Muslim Brotherhood was gunned down in Aleppo in December 1999, were said to have been HT members.
*In Egypt, Salih Sirriya—a Palestinian HT member—led a coup attempt in April 1974 along with approximately 100 other members. Together, they stormed the Technical Military Academy in Heliopolis, where they attacked the armory. They seized weapons and planned to assassinate President Sadat, but were apprehended after an ensuing firefight that killed eleven HT members and injured many others. Sirriya was tried, convicted and executed in November 1976. 
*In Denmark, HT members compiled a &quot;hit list&quot; of Danish Jewish community leaders, for which they were convicted and imprisoned in August 2002. In particular, HT leader Fadi Ahmad Abdel Latif was convicted of incitement to racial hatred.

Journalist Shiv Malik notes &quot;Among al-Qaeda leaders, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (architect of the 9/11 attacks), were both former members of Hizb ut-Tahrir according to intelligence sources.&quot;

==Political spectrum==
HT has been compared to both the political left and to fascism. Its &quot;methodology and linguistic foundations&quot;, some &quot;organizational principles&quot; are said to have resulted from heavy &quot;borrowing from socialist concepts&quot; or to have &quot;Marxist-Leninist undertones&quot; (utopian ultimate goal—communism or Caliphate, dislike of liberal democracy, well-organized centralized vanguard party made up of secretive cells, high importance placed on spread of its ideas/ideology, worldwide ambitions for revolutionary transformation of the social/political system), or to resemble a &quot;Socialist student movement&quot;, with many pamphlets and &quot;fiery speeches delivered by a small cadre of speakers from within their party structure&quot;.

It is known for &quot;borrowing expressions&quot; of the Western political left—such as &#x27;Sexism, like racism, is the product of the power structure&#x27;—in &quot;seek[ing] social justice&quot; and &quot;serv[ing] the poor&quot; rather than foreign powers, while denouncing &quot;capitalism&quot; and the inequality it produces, &quot;imperialism&quot;, governments of the economic elite ruling &quot;on behalf of the economic elite&quot;.

On the other hand, its ideology has also been called &quot;reactionary&quot;, &quot;escapist fascism&quot; and &quot;Islamic fascism&quot;. HT texts specifically denounce the concepts of &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;human rights&quot;, freedom of speech and of religion. Its constitution&#x27;s provision for financial &quot;revenue gained via occupation&quot; and a subordinate legal status, and special taxes on non-Muslims has been attacked as revealing a &quot;colonialist mindset&quot;, by critics Ahmed and Stuart. Along with the belief in the supremacy—moral, legal, political—of its (religious) communal group over all others, the party&#x27;s belief in revealed truth as the basis of doctrine, anti-semitism, a return to the gold standard, and restoring slavery as a category of citizenship, are also at odds with leftist tenets.

Australian writer and journalist Ramon Glazov describes HT&#x27;s marketing of its ideology (though not its substance) as &quot;similar to pushing libertarianism as a &#x27;neither Right nor Left&#x27; cure-all ideology.&quot;

==Activity by region==

The Heritage Foundation in the U.S. reports that the organization is active in 40 countries, with 5,000 to 10,000 &quot;hardcore&quot; members and tens of thousands of followers. Shiv Malik in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine estimates Hizb ut-Tahrir has about one million members.
It is proscribed in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, the United Kingdom, and in all but 3 Arab countries.

It had previously survived a proposed ban in Australia and the UK after clearance from the intelligence services and police; the group is proscribed in the UK as of 2024 but remains legal in Australia.

Hizb ut-Tahrir is a difficult issue for Western and Muslim governments because it aims to restore the Caliphate but rejects the use of violence to bring about political change.

===North Africa and Western Asia===
Hizb ut-Tahrir is proscribed in most Arab countries, but as of 2006 was permitted to operate in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Yemen.

In 2006, there were a spate of Hizb ut-Tahrir campaigns and related arrests throughout the Arab world, demonstrating a growth in its popularity. There were arrests in Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and visible public activities in the Palestinian territories, Zanzibar, and Lebanon, enjoying growing support among senior army staff, government officials, and the intelligentsia.

====Azerbaijan====
Hizb ut-Tahrir is thought to have several hundred members in Azerbaijan as of 2002. Dozens of its members have been arrested.

====Egypt====
HT expanded to Egypt in the mid-1950s, but according to Jamestown Foundation it has not shown &quot;significant traction&quot; since Egyptians are &quot;reluctant to see their distinctive historical, ethnic and cultural identities submerged within a caliphate&quot;.

It was banned after its alleged involvement in Saleh Sirriyah&#x27;s precoup attack in 1974 on Egypt&#x27;s Military Technical Academy. The attack was to be followed by the overthrow of Anwar el-Sadat&#x27;s regime to help HT establish its state. Sirriyah believed that sudden political revolt was necessary for HT to establish its state, differing with the party&#x27;s strategy of engendering popular support and seeking nussrah.

The assassins, who were taught and radicalised by Salim al-Rahhal, a member of HT, believed that they were seeking nussrah for HT to assume power. The assassins were later responsible for the murder of el-Sadat in 1981. In 1983, the government arrested and charged 60 HT members with &#x27;working to overthrow the regime with the aim of establishing the Caliphate.&#x27; In 2002, 26 men including three British nationals were arrested and convicted in 2004 for being members of HT and for &#x27;attempting to revive&#x27; the party in Egypt. In general, however, party support in Egypt remains weak when compared to competing Islamist groups, such as the MB.

According to Amnesty, four Muslim Britons and several Egyptians were tortured in Egypt for suspected affiliation with Hizb ut-Tahrir. Eventually 26 were put on trial for what observers in Egypt considered &quot;contradictory&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; charges.

====Iraq====
In 1969, when the son of Iraq&#x27;s highest Shia Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim was arrested and allegedly tortured, during widespread persecution of Shia, Abd al-Aziz al-Badri, a Sunni Islamic lawyer &quot;(Alim)&quot; and local Hizb ut-Tahrir leader, criticised the regime, and was killed under torture. A Sunni member of Hizb ut-Tahrir is thus seen as the first martyr for the rights of Shia in Iraq, against the old Ba&#x27;athist regime.

Saddam Hussein repressed HT members in Iraq in 1990, but when his army invaded Kuwait in 1990, like many Islamist and grassroots Muslim groups, HT saw the annexation as an act of unifying ‘Islamic lands’ and was enthusiastic. Farid Kassim, HTB&#x27;s first deputy leader and spokesperson at the time stated, &quot;From the Islam point of view, it is correct that any border should be removed, we are described in the Koran as one nation. The borders were not put there by Muslims, but by Europeans.&quot; British HT members gathered outside London Central Mosque in Regent&#x27;s Park in an attempt
to persuade others to join what they termed as Saddam&#x27;s jihad. Party representatives also went to the Iraqi Embassy in London to ask Saddam to announce himself as Caliph. Not withstanding this support, 11 HT members were executed in Iraq in 1990 for calling on Saddam to abandon Ba&#x27;athism and to adopt an Islamist state.

After Saddam&#x27;s removal in 2003, HT announced it would be opening an Iraqi branch. One HT member in Iraq, Abu Abdullah Al-Kurdi, claimed in a 2008 interview that the party has two offices in Baghdad, which American forces allegedly bombed, killing one HT activist.

In the civil war that followed the US invasion, HT has called for Sunni, Shia, Arab and Kurdish citizens to unite. 
Two prominent HT members (Adel Al-Rammah and Ahmad Sadoon Al-Ubayde) were reportedly murdered there in 2006, their bodies showing signs of torture. Regarding the hanging of former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein, Ismail Yusanto, spokesman of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Indonesia, said: &quot;The punishment should have been given to Saddam, because Saddam killed many Iraqi people and also members of Hizb ut-Tahrir there,&quot; and that President Bush and Tony Blair &quot;deserved no better.&quot;

====&quot;ISIS&quot;====

While HT has been compared to ISIL and both groups share the goal of re-establishing a caliphate that unites the Muslim world, the groups have acted as competitors rather than allies. In late 2014, HT reported that a &quot;senior member&quot; of its group had been executed by ISIL in Aleppo for &quot;questioning Baghdadi&#x27;s self-proclaimed Caliphate&quot;. William Scates Frances argues that the groups are &quot;embroiled in a bitter and ongoing feud&quot; and are quite different in organizational structure, and—at least in Australia—in their supporters culture and demographics.

====Jordan====

At the time of HT&#x27;s founding in the West Bank that area was under the control of the Kingdom of Jordan, and one HT member (Ahmad Ad-Da’ur) won a seat in Jordan&#x27;s parliament. However, as the party considered the Kingdom (like all non-caliphate states) illegitimate, called supporters to not recognize the constitution or state laws. Unsuccessful attempts to overthrow the government (sometimes planning to assassinate the king) using military elements in 1968, 1969, 1977 and 1993, have led to arrests, and prosecution and imprisonment of those found guilty of affiliation with the party.

As of 2014, Sheik Ahmad Abu Quddum was a spokesman for the Jordanian Tahrir party and called for the establishment of a worldwide caliphate and destruction of all Jews.

====Lebanon====
After fifty years of covert activity in Lebanon, the Lebanese government approved the registration of HT as a political party. (This may have happened because the government wanted to offset other influences such as those of Syria and Hezbollah, both of which are opposed by HT&#x27;s leadership. HT called a press conference on 19 May 2006, where its local spokesman, Dr Ayman al-Kadree, stated that HT would be transformed into a political party, after the Lebanese government arrested some of its members on terrorism-related charges. The head of the HT media office stated that &quot;the party will concentrate on an ideological and political call (da’wah) using argument and persuasion and conducting lectures, philosophical and political conferences, campaigns, forming and sending political delegations, etc.&quot;

====Libya====
Under the regime of Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, thirteen HT members were murdered according to the organization. Mohammed M. Ramadan, a Libyan journalist and announcer at the BBC&#x27;s Arabic section in London, was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir and opposed to the regime of Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi. He was assassinated on 11 April 1980 by Libyan operatives outside London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park Mosque. Several other members were killed in extrajudicial detention in Libya during the 1980s. 
Hizb ut-Tahrir described its organization along with the Muslim Brotherhood as the &quot;important organizations causing anxiety&quot; for the Libyan regime with Hizb ut-Tahrir endorsing &quot;armed resistance&quot; and successfully recruiting &quot;students from the universities and military academies.&quot;
====Palestine====
Most of the founding members of HT were Palestinians, the three leaders it has had since found have been Palestinians, and Palestinians have &quot;dominated the Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s leadership&quot;.

According to a 2007 report by &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; reporter Mark MacKinnon, Hizb ut-Tahrir has been &quot;capitalizing on public unhappiness with the recent bloodshed between the mainstream Hamas and Fatah movements that has split the Palestinian cause in two. A recent rally in the West Bank drew a crowd estimated in the tens of thousands.&quot; He quotes Hizb ut-Tahrir Sheik Abu Abdullah as preaching to Muslims
Why are we watching infidels prosper in this world and not stopping them? ... Muslims in China, Indonesia, Pakistan and everywhere in their thousands are asking for God&#x27;s government through the Caliphate. They demand the return of God&#x27;s rule on Earth.
According to HT, in July 2009, hundreds of its activists were arrested and authorities stopped the HT 2009 annual conference from being held. In September 2009, HT along with al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya
(the Lebanese branch of the MB), Hizbollah and Hamas, met in Lebanon to oppose US President Barack Obama&#x27;s Arab-Israeli peace plan. The leaders issued a statement concluding that the plan ‘poses one of the most dangerous American plans in the region.’ They also said that the plan: ‘… needs to be opposed in all possible forms, in particular by increasing acts of resistance […] and opposing Israeli efforts towards a normalisation of their relations with Arab countries….’ The leaders further added that the &quot;monopolisation&quot; of Palestinian leadership by President Abbas must be challenged, and the choice of resistance against US plans should
be encouraged. The Islamist groups agreed to keep in touch to discuss further issues of mutual interest.

====Syria====
Prior to the civil war, in Syria, party members, along with their relatives and acquaintances, were subject to repeated extrajudicial arrest. Representatives of HT claimed that 1,200 of its members were arrested by Syrian security forces in December 1999 and January 2000, according to the December 2000 issue of Middle East Intelligence Bulletin. Members of HT were among the political activists arrested in Syria in 2005 and tried before military courts, according to a 2006 report by Amnesty International. Since the civil war started in 2011, HT reports that it is engaged in &quot;dawah&quot; in Syria as of 2013,
and Syrian Democratic Forces reported finding Hizb ut-Tahrir flags and writings after taking Tell Rifaat from Ahrar al Sham in February 2016.

====Tunisia====
HT was established in Tunisia in the 1970s. In 1983, 30 men, including the head of the Tunisian HT branch, were arrested, charged with membership of an illegal organization and attempting to overthrow the government in order to replace it with a Caliphate. Of the 30 arrested, 19 were military personnel, and the remaining 11 were said to have incited army officers to join the party.
A May 2008 press statement issued by HT&#x27;s media office in North Africa reports that 20 activists were imprisoned in that month on charges of ‘participating in reestablishing an &quot;illegitimate&quot; organization (Hizb ut-Tahrir), holding unauthorised meetings, preparing a place for holding un-authorised meetings and in possession
of leaflets deemed as disturbing public order.’

Following the Tunisian Revolution and the fall of the Zine El Abidine Ben Ali regime, HT has been called the &quot;main hard-line Islamist group to emerge&quot;. It organized a female conference in Tunisia in March 2012.

====Turkey====
The Hizb ut-Tahrir is outlawed in Turkey. However, it is still in operation as a clandestine organization. As early
as 1967, leaders of HT Turkey were arrested, and have been frequently since then. 
According to &quot;Today&#x27;s Zaman&quot;, lieutenant Mehmet Ali Çelebi, detained in the Ergenekon investigations in 2008, allegedly had links with Hizb ut-Tahrir. Çelebi was allegedly the key that made possible the arrest of five Hizb ut-Tahrir members in September 2008. Despite the charges, Çelebi was found innocent. Although his cell phone was claimed to have sent signals for one minute and 22 seconds to the Fatih base station, police officials admitted that they had entered the group&#x27;s phone numbers in Çelebi&#x27;s phone by accident during the investigation.

On 24 July 2009, Turkish police arrested almost 200 people suspected of being members of Hizb ut-Tahrir.

===Central Asia===

In Central Asia, the party has expanded since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s from a small group to &quot;one of the most powerful organizations&quot; operating in Central Asia. The region itself has been called &quot;the primary battleground&quot; for the party. Uzbekistan is &quot;the hub&quot; of Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s activities in Central Asia, while its &quot;headquarters&quot; is now reportedly in Kyrgyzstan. Estimates of the party&#x27;s size in Central Asia range from 15,000 to 100,000.

Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned throughout Central Asia. Central Asian governments have been accused of torturing Hizb ut-Tahrir members and violating international law in their campaigns against the group.

The party&#x27;s &quot;primary focus&quot; in Central Asia is &quot;socioeconomic and human rights issues&quot;, calling for &quot;justice&quot; against &quot;corrupt and repressive state structures&quot;. From there it seeks to &quot;guide&quot; Central Asians towards support for the re-establishment of a Caliphate. It recruits from unemployed, pensioners, students and single mothers; &quot;representatives of local power structures&quot;, who can protect party cells from surveillance and prosecution; and &quot;law enforcement personnel&quot; who can &quot;facilitate access to sensitive information&quot;.

Among the factors attributed to HT&#x27;s success in the region are the religious and political &quot;vacuum&quot; of post-Soviet society there; the party&#x27;s strong organization, use of local languages; the answers it provides to problems of poverty, unemployment, corruption, drug addiction, prostitution and lack of education; its call for unification of the Central Asian states. Hizb ut-Tahrir was first started in Central Asia in Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan.

In addition to the five ex-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, the adjacent republic of Afghanistan, which was never part of the Soviet Union, and Chinese province of Xinjiang, are (or at least traditionally were in the case of Xinjiang) Muslim majority areas of Central Asia.

====Afghanistan====
HT supports the Taliban against what it calls &quot;the two enemies of Islam and the Muslims, America and Britain, waged an unjust war against the poor and defenceless Afghan people (...)&quot;.

====Kazakhstan====

HT was banned there in 2005 and has many fewer members in Kazakhstan than in neighboring countries—no more than 300 as of 2004.

====Kyrgyzstan====
Hizb ut-Tahrir was banned in Kyrgyzstan around late 2004, but as that time there were an estimated 3,000–5,000 HT members there.

Until sometime before 2004, the Kyrgyz government was &quot;the most tolerant&quot; of all Central Asian regimes towards HT—allowing leaflet distribution—and HT Central Asian headquarters was moved here from Uzbekistan.
However, the party increased in &quot;confidence and audacity&quot; and in October 2004 was declared the &quot;most significant extremist forces&quot; in Kyrgyzstan.

====Tajikistan====
As of 2004, there were an estimated 3,000–5,000 HT members in Tajikistan.

About 60,000 people lost their lives in Tajikistan&#x27;s 1992 to 1997 civil war where Islamists and liberal democrats fought against the Soviet old guard and unrest remains as of 2016.
Hizb ut-Tahrir activity in Tajikistan is primarily in the north near the Fergana Valley. In 2005, the Tajik government arrested 99 members of Hizb ut-Tahrir and 58 members in 2006. In 2007, Tajik courts convicted two HT members and sentenced them to 10 1/2 and 9 3/4 years respectively.
Membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment.

====Turkmenistan====
As of 2004 HT had no &quot;noticeable&quot; presence 
in Turkmenistan in part at least because of the nomadic nature of the population, the relatively shallow Islamic roots in its culture, and the extreme repression of the government. As of 2013 the American Foreign Policy Council also reports that political Islam in general has made little noticeable headway in Turkmenistan.

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbekistan has been called the site of the &quot;main ideological battle of competition over the region&#x27;s future&quot;. It is the most populous former-Soviet Central Asian country, and possessor of the region&#x27;s &quot;largest and most effective army&quot;. As the &quot;ancient spiritual and cultural center&quot; of the Hanafi school (&quot;madhhab&quot;) of Sunni Islam, it is more religious than the other ex-Soviet countries and the area where HT first set up operation in Central Asia in &quot;the early to mid-1990s&quot;. As of late 2004, HT had far more members in Uzbekistan than the other ex-Soviet states, with estimates ranging from 7,000 (Western intelligence) up to 60,000 (Uzbekistani government).

HT has vigorously attacked the Uzbek political system and strongman president Islam Karimov, as corrupt, shameless, hypocritical and &quot;an insolent and evil Jew, who hates&quot; Islam. Terrorist bombings, especially in 1999 and 2004 were blamed in part on HT by the government and have led to a brutal crackdown.

The Uzbekistan government has been criticized by human rights observers for detained HT members (among other Islamists) without charge or trial for lengthy periods, torturing and subjecting them to unfair trials, and imprisoning thousands for minor activities.
However, HT has also been accused of conducting a &quot;brilliant public relations and propaganda campaign&quot; that has framed the fight between HT and Karimov&#x27;s government as one between a &quot;peaceful&quot; religious group engaged in the &quot;battle of ideas&quot;, and a government repressing religion with torture, rather than sometimes brutal attempts by an authoritarian regime to combat a radical ideology and anti-constitutional activities.

====Xinjiang====
As of 2008, the emergence of Hizb ut-Tahrir was a &quot;recent phenomenon&quot; in the Mainland Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. According to Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, the party&#x27;s influence was &quot;limited&quot; to southern Xinjiang, but &quot;seems to be growing&quot;. 
One obstacle for the party in Xinjiang is that most Uyghur activists seek sovereignty for Xinjiang rather than union in a caliphate.
As in other parts of Central Asia the party has been designated &quot;terrorist&quot; by the government and is banned.

===South and Southeast Asia===

====Bangladesh====
A national branch of the organization was established in Bangladesh in 2000 and was banned by the government in 2009 for alleged involvement in militant activities. According to Mohammad Jamil Khan, an editor at the &quot;Dhaka Tribune&quot;, despite the ban, the group reportedly maintains &quot;members and sympathizers within the administration, various security agencies, higher educational institutions, mosques, and madrasas&quot; and continues to be active both online and offline, including on platforms such as websites and Facebook.

As of 2008, the leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s Bangladesh branch was believed to be Zituzzaman Hoque, a British national, whom the organization has acknowledged as a member. Hoque is reported to lecture at an independent university in Bangladesh.

On 19 January 2012, the Bangladesh Army indicated Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s involvement in an attempted coup in 2011 to overthrow the government. Subsequently, on 23 January 2012, the Rapid Action Battalion arrested Dr. Golam Haider Rasul, a physician at United Hospital in Dhaka, for his alleged connection to the organization. 

In 2024, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, reports suggest that the banned Hizb ut-Tahrir has resumed public activities.

====Indonesia====

Hizb ut-Tahrir used to work openly in Indonesia. Indonesia has been called the party&#x27;s &quot;strongest base&quot;, where in August 2007 tens of thousands of people demonstrated in support of the caliphate in the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta. They also held caliphate rallies in many cities across the country, such as in the Gelora 10 November Stadium in Surabaya in 2013.

The party was introduced in Indonesia in 1983 by Jordanian-Lebanese man named Abdurrahman al-Baghdadi. As of 2004 it was led by Muhammad Ismail Yusanto. It started as an underground campus movement and as of 2004 remained &quot;largely campus based&quot; with &quot;well-attended rallies and meetings without government restrictions&quot;.

According to the International Crisis Group HT Indonesia may have ties to violent extremist groups such as Jemaah Islamiyah, the group responsible for the Bali bombing in October 2002.

On 14 January 2016, four assailants staged a bomb and firearm attack in Jakarta where eight people (including the four assailants) died. Indonesian police named a Bahrun Naim, as the principal organizer of the attack. Bahrun was Indonesian but based in Syria with &quot;Islamic State&quot;, but before that &quot;studied with Hizbut Tahrir&quot; (both HT and Islamic State in favor of a new caliphate). HT Indonesia spokesman Muhammad Ismail Yusanto stated that Bahrun was expelled from Hizbut Tahrir when it was found out he was &quot;secretly hiding a weapon&quot;. 

On 8 May 2017, the Indonesia government announced plans to disband Hizb-ut Tahrir within Indonesia, as it is against Indonesia&#x27;s legislative foundation of Pancasila, an ideology based on a multi-faith democracy. In July 2017, the Indonesian government officially banned and revoked the legal status of Hizb-ut Tahir.

On 25 October 2022, an attempted shooting occurred in front of the Istana Negara in Jakarta. On 26 October 2022, after the investigation and checking the databases, National Counter Terrorism Agency announced that the assailant is a Hizb-ut Tahrir Indonesia member.

====Malaysia====

On 17 September 2015, the Selangor (Malaysia) Fatwa Committee declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a deviant group and said followers of the pro-Caliphate movement who continue to spread their ideologies and teachings in the state will face legal action.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, HT activities were &quot;officially launched in late 2000 and increased after 9/11&quot;. HT opened up its own publishing house in Peshawar for the benefit of Central Asian states to the northwest. Its efforts to recreate the Caliphate in Central Asia are &quot;believed to be supported by extremist groups&quot;, according to Zeyon Baran.
Hizb ut-Tahrir was proscribed and banned by Pakistani President General Musharraf in 2004. In October 2004, HT led a march of people to the Pakistani high commission in London, calling for the removal of Musharraf, declaring: &quot;Pakistan Army: why are you silent?&quot; Hizb ut-Tahrir branch in Pakistan does not have any links with terrorist groups.

On 17 October 2009, 35 HT members and supporters, including key leaders were arrested in Islamabad under anti-terrorism legislation. In May 2012, key members of HT including HT&#x27;s spokesman, Naveed Butt, was arrested by Pakistani police on the suspicion of inciting violence in the country. On 12 December 2014, Pakistani police arrested 12 more activists of HT.

Pakistani author Ahmed Rashid writes in &quot;Jihad: The Rise of Militant Islam in Central Asia&quot;, that there are &quot;strong links and cooperation between the rank and file&quot; of Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan especially when they are from the same village or town. However, according to Jean-François Mayer of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, the insinuation &quot;that the party will turn violent and has links with the IMU&quot; is inaccurate; the comments attributed to a member &quot;contradicted the party&#x27;s ideas&quot;. Representatives of Hizb ut-Tahrir report that they have repeatedly attempted to contact Ahmed Rashid in order to make their views known, but say they have not succeeded. They are even considering writing a rebuttal of his book.

In August 2012, a Brigadier and three majors in the Pakistan Army were convicted of being members of Hizb-ut-Tahrir (a banned organisation), the first time that senior army officers in Pakistan had been convicted and jailed over associations with banned organizations. The officers had allegedly attempted to recruit officers to their group &quot;including the commander of the army&#x27;s 111 Brigade, which covers the capital and has been historically linked to army coups.&quot; Taji-Farouki describes HT as &quot;operating openly despite&quot; a 2003 ban. In early 2016, Dawn reported a crackdown on HT.

===Western countries===
In Germany and Denmark, HT&#x27;s &quot;hostility to democratic institutions and its refusal to recognise Israel&#x27;s right to exist has caused legal problems&quot; according to Jean-Pierre Filiu. In France and Spain, as of 2008, HTs cells were illegal and the authorities were keeping the party under close surveillance.

While HT&#x27;s ideology and strategy are centralised, localities have different strategic action plans, so that for example when it comes to international situations, the Danish branch focuses on the Arab-Israeli issue because in Denmark the Muslim population is primarily of Arab descent while the British branches focus on Indian issues because in Britain Muslims are primarily of Indian descent.

====Australia====

Hizb ut-Tahrir has been involved in a number of controversies in Australia but has been &quot;clever at knowing how to be outrageous enough to get media attention but not get arrested&quot;, according to one observer (Greg Barton). Another observer (Irfan Yusuf) claims HT and anti-immigrant politicians &quot;feed off each other&#x27;s hysteria&quot;.

HT Media representative Uthman Badar talk ‘Honour killings are morally justified’ was canceled from a June 2014 Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Man Haron Monis, the gunman who took hostages in a siege at the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney, was found to have talked to members of Hizb ut-Tahrir and attended several of their events. 
At a July 2014 speech in Sydney, Australian party leader Ismail al-Wahwah called for a jihad against the Jewish people, prompting a complaint to the NSW Anti-discrimination Board. 
In another Sydney sermon, circa February 2015, Ismail al-Wahwah said regarding Jews that, &quot;There is only one solution for that cancerous tumor: It must be uprooted and thrown back to where it came&quot;. 
At a 19 January 2015 meeting in Sydney, HT leader Bilal Merhi called for a &quot;Muslim army in Australia&quot; to impose Sharia law in Australia, pointedly refusing to condemn acts of violence by the Islamic State.
At a November 2015 meeting in Sydney, hundreds of Muslims were told that their children should not be forced to sing the Australian anthem and that &quot;deradicalisation&quot; was an agenda of forced assimilation.

In 2005, Australia&#x27;s intelligence service investigated the possibility of banning HT but &quot;concluded new legislation would be needed&quot;. In 2007, the premier of New South Wales state attempted to outlaw Hizb ut-Tahrir but was blocked by Australia&#x27;s attorney general.

According to the Daily Telegraph, Hizb ut-Tahrir has more than 300 members in Australia. According to journalist Alison Bevege (who after great difficulty successfully sued HT for discrimination after being told sit at the back section of the room or leave an HT meeting in 2015), HT in Australia is not a legally registered organization. Since the organization will not reveal its leadership, the &quot;only public face&quot; of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia is its &quot;media spokesmen&quot;.

In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts, as prescribed in the Quran. One of the women said, &quot;a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline&quot; describing it as, &quot;a beautiful blessing&quot;. This interpretation of the particular ayah was condemned by more than 30 prominent leaders of the Muslim community including Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman, President of the Australian National Imams Council.

====Denmark====
HT opened a branch in Denmark in 2000 with the help of British HT members.
Hizb ut-Tahrir is legal in Denmark but ran into controversy in 2002, when it distributed leaflets in Copenhagen that a Danish court determined were racist propaganda. Imran Khan of the BBC program &quot;Newsnight&quot; described the leaflet as follows:
In March and April 2002, Hizb Ut Tahrir handed out leaflets in a square in Copenhagen, and at a mosque. The leaflet also said, &#x27;The Jews are a people of slander... a treacherous people... they fabricate lies and twist words from their right context.&#x27; And the leaflet describes suicide bombings in Israel as &quot;legitimate&quot; acts of &quot;Martyrdom&quot;. 
In August 2006, Fadi Abdelatif, Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s spokesperson in Denmark, was given a suspended 60-day jail sentence for distributing the leaflet. Abdelatif was also found guilty of threats against the Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
The court rejected his claims that he was just quoting from the Koran, that it was an act of free speech and that it was aimed only at the Israeli state and not Jews. In 2002 HT Denmark was also accused of produced &quot;a ‘hit list’ of 15 to twenty leading members of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish community.&quot; HT has been successful in attracting disaffected youth and, according to the Copenhagen Post, petty criminal youth, including young ethnic Danes. It is &quot;only organization that offers organized Quran instruction in Danish ...&quot;

In 2007 Berlingske Tidende reported that a kindergarten in Copenhagen was being run in line with the ideology of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Also that year, several well known imams in Copenhagen attended a convention of Hizb ut-Tahrir and announced that they were willing to work together towards mutual goals. This move attracted criticism from a variety of Muslim and non-Muslim voices.

In 2016, Copenhagen Municipality decreed that Hizb ut-Tahrir could not rent space or hold event in any building owned by the municipality.

====Germany====
The first national branch in a non-Muslim majority country was established in West Germany in the 1960s.

German police expelled a member of the party from Germany for alleged ties to one of the hijackers involved with the 11 September 2001 attacks. However, German police said the raids and searches in offices and homes revealed little.

In January 2003, Hizb ut-Tahrir was barred from public activity in Germany, German Interior Minister Otto Schily stating that the group was spreading violence and hate and had called for the killing of Jews. The charges originate from a conference at Technische Universität Berlin, organized by a student society affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The group&#x27;s representative in Germany Assem Shaker responded that the group was not anti-Semitic. He added, &quot;We do not call to kill Jews. Our call is addressed to the Muslim people to defend themselves against the Zionist aggression in Palestine. And they have the right to do so.&quot;

The anti-semitism charges were not upheld in German courts, but the ban was continued based on the state&#x27;s finding that the group&#x27;s activity opposed the idea of understanding among nations and endorsed force as a means towards its political aims. A lawsuit against the ban was rejected on 23 January 2006 by the Federal Administrative Court in Germany. The organization appealed the ban to the European Court, stating in 2008:&quot;We note that the German courts did not uphold any of the German Interior Ministries accusations of anti-Semitism against HT, however, they have now relied on an obscure principle of the &#x27;idea of international understanding&#x27; to ban all of our activities (speeches, study circles, articles, vigils, political meetings, books, magazines, and debates).&quot;
As of 2004 HT &quot;continues to recruit and raise funds&quot; in Germany but &quot;any organizational structures&quot; there &quot;remain hidden&quot;, and HT activists in the country behave &quot;in a highly secretive manner&quot;, according to Zeynon Baran.

On 31 July 2006 two Lebanese men planted incendiary bombs in German commuter trains but the devices that could have killed hundreds failed to explode (see 2006 German train bombing attempts). The perpetrators belonged to a group that was affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The motive was to kill infidels as a &quot;revenge&quot; for cartoons of Mohammad in a Danish newspaper in 2005.

====Netherlands====
Hizb ut-Tahrir Indonesia spokesperson, Ismail Yusanto said to Nikolaos van Dam, the Dutch ambassador for Indonesia that the Dutch government is responsible for the Fitna of Geert Wilders and declared &quot;aslim taslam&quot; (submit to Islam).

====Russia====
In the late 1990, the former president of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov launched an extensive crackdown on Islamic organizations, such as HT, forcing their members to flee abroad. Russia being the top destination for the labour migrants from Uzbekistan accommodated a significant number of silent HT adepts from Uzbekistan. Their first Russian HT cells emerged in 1999 in Nizhnevartovsk, a city in the oil-rich region of Yugra. Later they appeared also in Dagestan, North Caucasus, and in Tatarstan, Volga region. The adepts held gatherings on the private premises recruiting newcomers among both local, including non-Muslim, and migrant populations, denouncing the Russian rule and praising the armed combat against the non-Islamic governments globally. According to the experts estimates, by 2013 native Muslims made up only 50% in HT in Russia, the rest are native Russians, Ukrainians and other typically non-Muslim individuals. They are mostly between the age of 18 to 30 and well-educated.

In February 2003, the Russian Supreme Court put Hizb ut-Tahrir and 14 other groups, including foreign, such as Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Muslim Brotherhood and local militant insurgents on a list of banned terrorist organizations. As per the Court&#x27;s decision, the motivation in respect of HT were their &quot;militant Islamic propaganda combined with intolerance to other religions&quot; and &quot;subversive activities to fracture the society&quot; aimed at the removal of the non-Islamic regimes and establishing the global Caliphate, primarily within the regions where Muslim populations are present&quot;.

In 2005, nine people accused of links to HT, a &quot;banned organization&quot;, were put on trial in Russia, just one of several trials on charges of association with the group around that time. Human rights groups have complained that authorities were increasingly becoming repressive and planting evidence on Muslims to justify charges. Among the arrested was the head of HT cell in Nizhnevartovsk who was found to have &quot;kept extremist literature promoting hatred and intolerance&quot;; earlier this person had turned, to no avail, to the local TV station for the airtime to publicly promote his views.

In 2010, three people were killed in Staroye Almetyevo, Tatarstan, reportedly in a shootout with Russian security forces. They were accused for recent bombing against a law enforcement facility. According to an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, there was &quot;a 90 percent chance the liquidated terrorists belong to a banned Islamist organization, which could be Hizb ut-Tahrir.&quot;

Russian wing of HT held liaisons with Russian political opposition, both left and right-wing. In 2012, the Left Front leader Sergey Udaltsov called Islamic radicals to support the &quot;March of Millions&quot; against the rule of Vladimir Putin. During the police raid at HT premises in Chelyabinsk, Urals region, evidence was found that a female HT activist penetrated into the close circle of the liberal opposition leadership.

During early 2012–2013, HT arranged mass street actions in Dagestan, namely in Kizlyar (known for the insurgent raid of 1996) and capital Makhachkala. Both started with a prayer in local mosque that was followed by a march under the black banners, emotional speeches and burning down of the US flag. The speakers denounced both &quot;pro-Assad&quot; and &quot;pro-democratic&quot; policies pursued by Russia and the US in Syria respectively, and called for the Sharia law there. More street actions and minor fights with police followed until police blocked a march of 25 vehicles decorated with HT banners and arrested the leader of Dagestani HT cell, Magomed Kartashov.

In an article in Time magazine of 8 May 2013, investigative journalist Simon Shuster published his findings about the extensive contacts between the detained Kartashov and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the man responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013, that took place in Dagestan as Tsarnaev visited Russia before the bombing.

In October 2015, 20 supporters of Hizb ut-Tahrir, were detained in and around Moscow, and &quot;up to 100 others&quot; were under investigation, according to a &quot;source in Moscow&#x27;s security services.&quot;

In October 2018, the head of Russian wing of HT was reported to have been arrested in Tatarstan for planning of the terrorist actions against the law and order.

Hizb ut-Tahrir operates in Crimea among the Crimean Tatars. Following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea at least 19 people were arrested on suspicion of membership. (Since the annexation, the status of Crimea is under dispute between Russia and Ukraine; Ukraine and the majority of the international community considers Crimea an integral part of Ukraine, while Russia, on the other hand, considers Crimea an integral part of Russia, with Sevastopol functioning as a federal city. Russian authorities are in control of both). According to the head of FSB, during 2018 three HT cells were deactivated in Crimea. Ruslan Balbek, member of the Russian Parliamentary Committee for Religious Matters claimed that the existing Crimean HT cells remained there &quot;since the time of the Ukrainian rule and are financed from abroad&quot;. As Ukrainian news outlet Strana.ua reported, before 2014 Crimean HT activists were not persecuted as HT was not deemed terrorist organization in the Ukraine, but once the Russian authorities initiated a massive crackdown on the banned HT in Russia proper and in Crimea, many HT activists fled Russia for Ukraine and settled mostly in Odesa, where they are expecting a refugee status that Ukrainian authorities are very reluctant to provide. In August 2022, TASS reported that the Russian Federal Security Service has busted a Hizb ut-Tahrir clandestine terror cell in Crimea.

==== Sweden ====

In 2012, investigating magazine Expo wrote that Hizb ut-Tahrir had started to establish itself in Sweden. In October 2012 Hizb ut-Tahrir situated its annual &quot;caliphate conference&quot; in Stockholm. The group at the time had a section for all of Scandinavia which was primarily active in Denmark.

In the 2018 Swedish general elections, the group campaigned in the Stockholm area for Muslims not to vote.

====United Kingdom====

Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in the United Kingdom, having been declared a proscribed terrorist organization in January 2024. The UK branch had been described as a &quot;logistical nerve centre&quot; of the organization, where its leaflets and books are produced for global distribution. According to Abdul Qadeem Zallum, the global leader from 1977 to 2003, the United Kingdom is also the land of the &quot;arch enemies of Islam&quot;, who Muslims should &quot;harbour hatred for&quot; and &quot;a yearning for revenge over&quot;.

In 2005, the UK Home Office described Hizb ut-Tahrir as a &quot;radical, but to date non-violent Islamist group&quot; that &quot;holds anti-Jewish, anti-western and homophobic views&quot;. In 2007, HTB &quot;dominate[d]&quot; the Islamist &quot;scene&quot; in Britain with an estimated 8,500 members, but has declined in size and as of 2015 has been described as &quot;less influential&quot;. As of mid-2015 Abdul Wahid was the leader of HT Britain, and the party was reportedly funded by private donations and membership revenue.

In January 2024, the British government declared its intention to seek parliamentary approval to designate Hizb ut-Tahrir a proscribed terrorist organization. On 19 January, parliament approved the draft order and the group was formally banned. Membership of, and expression of support for, Hizb ut-Tahrir is a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The decision came after the group organized rallies in support of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, featuring chants of &quot;jihad&quot;. The group denies supporting Hamas and advocating violence. The group was under the threat of being proscribed twice in the past — by the UK government in the immediate aftermath of the 7/7 bombings and by the ruling Conservative Party during the 2010 General Election – and with blacklisting from airwaves and universities in another 2015 Tory plan.

====United States====

Hizb ut-Tahrir America, based in Chicago, was reportedly founded by Dr. Mohammed Malkawi, who is an adjunct professor at Argosy University-Chicago. The group held its first conference in the United States in 2009. However, a subsequent attempt to hold a conference in 2010 at the Chicago Marriott Oak Brook hotel was cancelled after the hotel dropped the group&#x27;s reservation. In 2012, the group attempted to hold its annual conference entitled &quot;Revolution: Liberation by Revelation – Muslims Marching Toward Victory&quot; conference at the Meadows Club, but this was also cancelled after the club pulled out due to criticism. 

Reza Iman, who is a spokesperson for the group, claimed that the group has been active in the United States for almost 30 years, and defended Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s activities, stating in an interview that &quot;The call is not to bring that [an Islamic caliphate] here to this country or anything of that sort. The message is for Muslim countries to return to Islamic values.&quot; DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis stated that &quot;I have not seen any evidence they have engaged in violent activity in the U.S.&quot; and that the group&#x27;s views and goals, while controversial, did not warrant its labeling as a terrorist group.

Zaher Sahloul, who is the chairman of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago and president of the Mosque Foundation of Bridgeview, stated that &quot;[Hizb ut-Tahrir&#x27;s is] on the fringes of the political Islamic groups. They are very vocal and they target young Muslims in college (who) are attracted to their ideologies. They tend to disrupt lectures, Friday prayers. Most of the time they are kicked out from mosques.&quot; Sahloul added that &quot;We cannot deny people of speaking freely, but we believe that these kind of radical ideologies are not helpful.&quot;

At a conference in Jordon in June 2013, Dr. Malkawi stated (as translated by MEMRI) &quot;Let Britain, America, and the entire West go to hell, because the Caliphate is coming, Allah willing.&quot; Regarding US President Barack Obama, Malkawi stated &quot;Obama says to you, in Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere: &#x27;I have chosen heresy as a religion for you.&#x27; Will you accept heresy as your religion, oh Muslims? Say: &#x27;Allah Akbar.&quot;

==Books==
The book &quot;The Islamist&quot; by Ed Husain reveals the inner workings of the political organization. It follows the path of a young man coming to terms with his extremist/Islamist mindset. He describes how violence and the increasing radicalisation of the group eventually lead to him cutting all ties and resigning from the head of the local group at Tower Hamlets University. The author, now a moderate Muslim, is opposed to the ideology of Hizb ut-Tahrir and critical of the consequences of political Islam poisoning young minds.

&quot;&quot; is Maajid Nawaz&#x27;s autobiography. It partly recounts his time as a recruiter for Hizb ut-Tahrir, his imprisonment in Egypt from 2002 to 2006, and his release after being cited as a &quot;prisoner of conscience&quot; by Amnesty International. In 2007, he left HT and co-founded the Quilliam Foundation with Ed Husain, an organization focused on countering extremism in the Muslim World. &quot;Radical&quot; was released in the UK in 2012; a US edition was published by Lyons Press in October 2013 with a preface for US readers and an updated epilogue.

<doc id="782742" wikidata="Q466730" url="?curid=782742" title="American Service-Members' Protection Act">
<text>The American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act, known informally as The Hague Invasion Act (ASPA, Title 2 of ) is a United States federal law described as &quot;a bill to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party.&quot; The text of the Act has been codified as subchapter II of chapter 81 of title 22, United States Code. The act gives the president power to use &quot;all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court&quot;.

== Description ==

The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act authorizes the President of the United States to use &quot;all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court&quot;. This authorization led to the act being nicknamed &quot;The Hague Invasion Act&quot;, since the act would allow the president to order military action in The Hague, the seat of the ICC, to prevent American or allied officials and military personnel from being prosecuted or detained by the ICC.

The bill was introduced by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms (Republican from North Carolina) and U.S. Representative Tom DeLay (Republican from Texas), as an amendment to the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States (H.R. 4775). The amendment (S.Amdt 3597) was passed 75–19 by the US Senate, with 30 Democrats and 45 Republicans voting in support. The bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush on August 2, 2002.

Section 2008 of the Act authorizes the president of the U.S. &quot;to use all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any person described in subsection (b) who is being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court&quot;. The subsection (b) specifies this authority shall extend to &quot;Covered United States persons&quot; (members of the Armed Forces of the United States, elected or appointed officials of the United States Government, and other persons employed by or working on behalf of the United States Government) and &quot;Covered allied persons&quot; (military personnel, elected or appointed officials, and other persons employed by or working on behalf of the government of a NATO member country, a major non-NATO ally including Australia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Argentina, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand).

The act prohibits federal, state, and local governments and agencies (including courts and law enforcement agencies) from assisting the International Criminal Court (ICC). For example, it prohibits the extradition of any person from the U.S. to the ICC; it prohibits the transfer of classified national security information and law enforcement information to the ICC; and it prohibits agents of the court from conducting investigations in the U.S.

The act also prohibits U.S. military aid to countries that are party to the ICC. However, exceptions are allowed for aid to NATO members, major non-NATO allies, Taiwan, and countries that have entered into &quot;Article 98 agreements&quot;, agreeing not to hand over U.S. nationals to the ICC. Additionally, the act does not prohibit the U.S. from assisting in the search and capture of foreign nationals wanted for prosecution by the ICC, specifically naming Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milošević, Omar al-Bashir and Osama bin Laden as examples.

==Reception==
Within the European Union reaction was overwhelmingly negative. A European Parliament resolution on July 4, 2002, condemned the act while it was in its draft stage. 

Dutch reaction to the Act was negative, taking issue with section 2008 of the bill. The Dutch Ambassador to the United States, Boudewijn van Eenennaam, voiced his protests saying that the Dutch were &quot;Not particularly amused by Section 2008&quot; and that &quot;we think the language used was ill-considered to say the least&quot;. Meanwhile the Dutch House of Representatives passed a motion expressing its concern about the bill and its &quot;detrimental&quot; effects on trans-Atlantic relations. The Danish Minister for European Affairs, Bertel Haarder, stated that the law contradicted the idea of upholding human rights and the rule of law, while the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer penned a letter cautioning that &quot;adopting the ASPA would open a rift between the U.S. and the European Union on this important issue [of the ICC]&quot;.

The Coalition for the International Criminal Court has called the act a &quot;dangerous symbolic opposition to international criminal justice&quot; and Human Rights Watch condemned the law.

== Repeal attempt ==
In 2022, an attempt to repeal the bill, sponsored by US Representative Ilhan Omar, was introduced but died in Congress in committee; no vote was ever taken.

<doc id="782745" wikidata="Q433334" url="?curid=782745" title="Phil Vickery (rugby union)">
<text>Philip John Vickery MBE DL (born 14 March 1976) is a former English rugby union tighthead prop and member of the England squad. He was a member of England&#x27;s World Cup winning squad in 2003, playing in all seven matches in the tournament, and is a former England captain. Vickery ended his club rugby career at London Wasps, joining the London side in 2006 after eleven years with Gloucester Rugby. Given the nickname &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, he played in three Rugby World Cups, including as England captain in the 2007 tournament, and toured Australia and South Africa with the British &amp; Irish Lions.
Made his debut for Bolingey Barbarians Sunday 25th Sept 2022 vs Bude vets.

==Early years==
The son of a dairy farmer, Vickery was born to Cornish parents in Barnstaple, Devon, England and says he is proud to be a Cornishman and an Englishman. Educated at Budehaven School, his interest in sport developed as a youngster, and by age 12 he started playing rugby. By the age of 16 he gained his first National Representative honour, being picked for the England Schools U16s group.

Vickery left school age 16 and worked as a herdsman on his parents&#x27; farm. He remains a qualified cattle inseminator.

Vickery has an Oriental tattoo on his left shoulder which roughly translates to &quot;I&#x27;ll fight you to the death&quot;, and a bulldog tattoo on his right.

==Career==
He started with the Cornish club Bude, then moved to Redruth, during which time he first appeared in an England Colts side. In 1995, England &#x27;A&#x27; coach Richard Hill persuaded the 19-year-old Vickery to join Gloucester Rugby, where he became known as &quot;The Raging Bull&quot;. Whilst at Gloucester he started in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Rugby. The following year he missed their 2003 Powergen Cup Final triumph through injury.

His representative career went from strength to strength, with appearances for England U21s and Colts in the 1996–97 season.

In April 2006 he announced he was quitting Gloucester Rugby after 11 years and signed for Wasps in a 3-year deal. Vickery made his Wasps debut in their 23 – 13 win over London Irish on 8 October 2006. With Wasps he won both the Heineken Cup in 2007 and the 2008 Guinness Premiership title.

On 28 October 2010, Vickery was forced to retire from rugby after suffering from several neck injuries. He played his last game at Kingsholm against Gloucester on 25 September, which is where he started his career.

On 28 May 2012 Worcester Warriors announced that Vickery would join the club as their new Assistant Forwards (Scrum) coach for the
forthcoming 2012–2013 season. After an unsuccessful season, Worcester made wholesale changes in the coaching staff, from head coach through the assistants, and Vickery was one of the casualties.

==Representative career==
Vickery made his England debut against Wales aged 21 on 21 February 1998, coming off the bench to replace Darren Garforth against Wales at Twickenham in the Five Nations tournament, a match England won 60–26. It was the completion of a rapid rise through the England set-up, after only 34 first team games for his club and just 81 days after his England A debut.

The Tour from Hell

Summer 1998 saw Vickery taking part in the tour of the Southern Hemisphere, part of an England squad which had been severely weakened by injury and player unavailability. In the space of a month, England were soundly defeated by Australia (76–0 in Brisbane on 6 June), twice by New Zealand (64–22 in Dunedin on 20 June and 40–10 in Auckland on 27 June) and finally by South Africa (18–0 in Cape Town on 4 July). There were also losses to New Zealand &#x27;A&#x27;, New Zealand Rugby Academy, and New Zealand Māori.

The tour had benefits for some players, bringing through future stars of the England side such as Vickery himself, Jonny Wilkinson, Danny Grewcock, Graham Rowntree, Austin Healey, Matt Dawson and Matt Perry, others effectively had their international careers ended. Steve Ravenscroft, Rob Fidler, Jos Baxendell, Spencer Brown and Tom Beim each gained two caps on the tour. Richard Pool-Jones, Scott Benton, Dominic Chapman and Stuart Potter only played once for England, on the Tour From Hell.

Vickery recovered from a neck injury in April 1999 and played in that year&#x27;s Rugby World Cup. A shoulder injury, however, kept him out of the 2000 South Africa tour. Vickery toured Australia with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001 and played in all three tests.

Vickery was appointed captain of the England squad that toured Argentina in 2002. With many of the top players rested, Vickery led the side to victory against The Pumas in Buenos Aires.

Vickery missed the 2003 Six Nations tournament because of a back injury, but having returned to the team he did well for England on the road to the 2003 World Cup. He played in all seven games in the tournament, which was won by England, and captained the side against Uruguay. He scored his first international try when he came off the bench against Samoa in England&#x27;s third game of the tournament.

A rib injury prevented him from captaining the non-capped match against the New Zealand Barbarians in December 2003. Although he took a full part in the 2004 Six Nations, another back operation in May ruled him out of the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He returned to rugby only in late October 2004.

Making his international comeback, he came on as a replacement against South Africa for the first Autumn Test between the two sides on 18 November 2006. After playing well, he drove over to score the winning try, which was converted by Andy Goode, and England won their first game since February that year.

He was selected on 2 January by new England head coach Brian Ashton to captain the side during the 2007 Six Nations Championship and 2007 Rugby World Cup. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 RWC Finals, the other three being Jonny Wilkinson, Jason Robinson and Ben Kay.

Also, on 8 January 2008 he was selected in the squad for the 2008 Six Nations Championship by Brian Ashton. He played every game except for the 23–19 win over Italy which he missed through injury. He was selected to tour South Africa with the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions, starting the first and third test. He took a merciless pounding from Tendai Mtawarira in the first test in particular, probably the worst of his career. To his credit, he performed admirably in the third test when he replaced the injured Adam Jones to start.

==Personal life==
He was a co-commentator for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Vickery won the 2011 series of Celebrity Masterchef beating Kirsty Wark and Nick Pickard in the final.

He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 2015.

<text>Columbus Delano (June 4, 1809 – October 23, 1896) was an American lawyer, rancher, banker, statesman, and a member of the prominent Delano family. Forced to live on his own at an early age, Delano struggled to become a self-made man. Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig, he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories. He became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans&#x27; civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but not as part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union.

Delano served as President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior during a time of rapid Westward expansionism, and contended with conflicts between Native tribes and White American settlers. He was instrumental in the establishment of America&#x27;s first national park, having supervised the first federally funded scientific expedition into Yellowstone in 1871, and becoming America&#x27;s first national park overseer in 1872. In 1874, Delano requested that Congress protect Yellowstone through the creation of a federally funded administrative agency, the first Secretary of the Interior to request such preservation of a nationally important site.

Believing that the communal, collective, and nomadic lifestyles of Native American tribes led to war and impoverishment, Delano argued that the most humane Indian policy was to force tribes onto small reservations in the Indian Territory, ceding their land to the United States, and assimilating them into white culture. The goal was for Indian tribes to be independent of federal funding. To compel the Native tribes to move to reservations, Delano supported the slaughter to the near extinction of the vast buffalo herds outside of Yellowstone, which were essential to the maintenance of the Plains Indians&#x27; way of life.

Concerning government reform, Delano defied Grant&#x27;s 1872 executive order to implement the first Civil Service Commission&#x27;s recommendations. With the exception of Yellowstone, the spoils system and corruption permeated throughout the Interior Department during his tenure, and Grant requested Delano&#x27;s resignation in 1875; he left office with his reputation damaged. Delano remained a spoils man at a time when reformer demands for a federal merit system were gaining support. Delano returned to Ohio to practice law, tend to his business interests, and raise livestock; he did not return to politics and died in 1896.

Delano was traditionally viewed a 19th-century American &quot;major mover and shaker.&quot; However, historians have strongly criticized Delano&#x27;s weak oversight of the Interior, allowing rampant corruption, and for his treatment of Native Americans and endorsement of the Plains Indian bison slaughter. Yellowstone is considered Delano&#x27;s greatest achievement, where bison and other wildlife were legally protected. He was viewed as an effective first administrator of America&#x27;s first national park. While in office, Delano was an outspoken supporter of black American rights and an opponent of the Ku Klux Klan.

==Early life, education, and political career==
Columbus Delano was born in Shoreham, Vermont, on June 4, 1809, the son of James Delano and Lucinda Bateman. The Delano family was of French ancestry; its first representative in America, Philip Delano, voyaged from Holland in 1621 on the &quot;Fortune&quot;, the sister ship of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Delano&#x27;s father died in 1815 when Delano was six years old, and his family was put under the care of his uncle Luther Bateman. In 1817 the family moved to Mount Vernon in Knox County, Ohio, where Delano resided for the rest of his life. Delano was raised primarily by Luther Bateman, who died in 1817. After an elementary education Delano worked in a woolen mill in Lexington, Ohio, and at other manual laboring jobs, becoming largely self-sufficient while still a teenager.

After beginning self-directed legal studies, Delano formally trained with Mount Vernon attorney Hosmer Curtis from 1830 to 1831, and he attained admission to the bar in 1831. Delano became active in politics as a National Republican, and later as a Whig, and in 1834 he won election as Prosecuting Attorney for Knox County. He won reelection in 1836 and served two terms, 1835 to 1839.

==Marriage and family==
On July 14, 1834, Delano married Elizabeth Leavenworth of Mount Vernon, the daughter of M. Martin Leavenworth and Clara Sherman Leavenworth. Their children included daughter Elizabeth (1838–1904), who was the wife of Reverend John G. Ames of Washington, DC, and son John Sherman Delano (1841–1896), a businessman who also worked with his father at the Department of the Interior.

Delano and Ulysses S. Grant were distant cousins; they had great-great-grandparents in common.

==United States Representative (1845–1847)==

In 1844, Delano was elected to the United States House of Representatives after appearing on the ballot as a replacement for Samuel White Jr., who had died after winning the Whig nomination. He went on to defeat Democrat Caleb J. McNulty by only 12 votes, 9,297 to 9,285.

=== Tenure ===
Delano served in the 29th Congress, (March 4, 1845—March 3, 1847), and was a member of the Committee on Invalid Pensions. He also gave a speech denouncing the Mexican–American War which earned him national recognition as an opponent of the conflict.

=== Campaign for governor ===
Delano did not run for reelection in 1846, instead campaigning for the 1848 Whig nomination for Governor of Ohio. He lost to Seabury Ford by two votes at the January 1848 party convention; Ford went on to defeat Democrat John B. Weller in a close general election, and served one term. Delano subsequently became involved in several business ventures; in 1850 he set up a successful Wall Street banking partnership, &quot;Delano, Dunlevy, &amp; Company&quot;, which specialized in railroad bonds; it included a branch office in Cincinnati and operated for five years. In addition, Delano became a successful sheep rancher, and served as president of the National Association of Wool Growers and the Ohio Wool Growers Association. He was also active in other businesses; he was president of the Springfield, Mount Vernon &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad, and an original incorporator of the First National Bank of Mount Vernon, of which he later became president.

==Republican Party and the Civil War==

With the demise of the Whigs, Columbus Delano joined the new Republican Party. Delano was a delegate to the Chicago Convention in 1860, and he seconded the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for president. Delano actively campaigned for Lincoln, who won the presidency. The following year Delano served as Commissary-General of Ohio, on the staff of Governor William Dennison Jr., and aided in raising and equipping troops for the Union Army at the start of the American Civil War. In 1862 Delano was a candidate for the United States Senate seat held by Benjamin Wade. With Republicans in control of the Ohio General Assembly, winning their nomination was tantamount to election by the full legislature. Delano was nearly successful, losing the nomination to Wade by only two votes. In 1863, Delano served in the Ohio House of Representatives and played a notable role in shepherding the passage of legislation in support of the Union war effort. Delano served as Chairman of the Judicial Committee and settled the matter of the right of soldiers to vote. Delano served as Chairman of the Ohio delegation that attended the Baltimore Convention. Lincoln was successfully nominated for a second term of office.

==Reconstruction Era==
===Return to Congress===
Delano was again elected to the U.S. House in 1864, and he served in the 39th Congress (March 4, 1865—March 3, 1867). During this term, Delano was chairman of the House Committee on Claims. Delano appeared to lose his bid for reelection in 1866, but successfully contested the election of George W. Morgan. After unseating Morgan, Delano served for the remainder of the 40th Congress, June 3, 1868—March 3, 1869. After the Civil War Delano supported Radical Reconstruction, believing that the South was in chaos and that federal involvement in the Southern states, including the army, was necessary to keep the peace. He did not run for reelection in 1868.

===Reconstruction speech (1867)===
In September 1867, Delano made a speech on Reconstruction in Eaton, Ohio, in which he said that President Andrew Johnson did not have the constitutional authority to establish civil government in the former Confederate states. Delano argued that Congress, not the president, &quot;was required to establish civil governments in all the states.&quot; In Delano&#x27;s view, Johnson and Southern Democrats, who had previously supported the Confederacy, were conspiring to overthrow Congress by undermining its authority to make laws concerning Southern Reconstruction. As proof, Delano cited Johnson&#x27;s September 1866 Swing Around the Circle speech, in which Johnson said the national legislature was a &quot;pretended Congress&quot;. In addition, Delano believed Johnson was conspiring to remove Ulysses S. Grant as head of the army because of Grant&#x27;s support for Congressional Reconstruction. As a result, Delano advocated impeaching Johnson and removing him from office, and argued that Grant should be protected by Congress from any attempt by Johnson to remove him. Unknown to Delano, on August 11, 1867, Grant had agreed to accept Johnson&#x27;s offer to serve as interim Secretary of War, while simultaneously remaining general of the army. Under the provisions of the Tenure of Office Act, the appointment would be temporary until the U.S. Senate returned to session in January 1868, and either ratified or prohibited Stanton&#x27;s removal. Johnson and Grant agreed to Grant&#x27;s temporary appointment despite explicitly admitting that they disagreed on Reconstruction policy.

===Commissioner of Internal Revenue===
Delano remained active in politics and supported Grant for president in 1868. When Grant became president in March 1869, he appointed Delano Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Delano served from March 11, 1869, to October 31, 1870. As commissioner, Delano tried with mixed success to collect federal revenue on alcohol and tobacco products manufactured in Indian Territory; these items could be produced for sale tax-free within the territory, but manufacturers routinely sold them in adjacent states without paying the taxes. He also proved unwilling or unable to cope with the frauds of the Whiskey Ring; despite having received warnings of corruption including bribery of federal officials and failure to pay taxes, Delano took little or no action. The department did attempt to prevent the illegal manufacture and sale of whiskey in other areas; on January 31, 1870, an Internal Revenue raid in Georgia captured 18 illicit whiskey stills and their operators. The Whiskey Ring was finally stopped in 1875 during Grant&#x27;s second term by Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow. The ring leader, John McDonald was an acquaintance of President Grant and had requested from him a political appointment as superintending inspector of internal revenue in St. Louis. Grant then directed Delano to make the appointment. McDonald was convicted of fraud and theft and served 17 months in prison. In all, the investigation of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 110 convictions. Grant&#x27;s private secretary, Orville E. Babcock was implicated, but acquitted at trial after Grant provided written testimony on his behalf. Additionally, Delano was cleared of involvement in another scandal in which Babcock was implicated, the Gold Ring, which was triggered when two New York financiers attempted to corner the gold market on September 24, 1869. Daniel Butterfield, the Assistant Treasurer of the United States, and Grant&#x27;s brother in law Abel Corbin were also implicated; Butterfield was forced to resign in October. Delano&#x27;s reputation for personal honesty was not in question, which was an asset when Grant needed to nominate a new Secretary of the Interior in 1870.

===Secretary of the Interior===

United States Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar and Secretary of the Interior Jacob D. Cox resigned in 1870 because of Grant&#x27;s decision to overrule them on the issue of the McGarrahan Claims; speculator William McGarrahan claimed title to a tract of mining land in California, as did the New Idria Mining Company. Grant wanted no executive branch action taken, considering both claims to be fraudulent; Cox and Hoar disagreed and decided in favor of New Idria, which prompted Grant to request their resignations.

Grant appointed Delano to succeed Cox at the Interior Department; he served from November 1, 1870, until resigning on October 19, 1875. During Delano&#x27;s tenure, the Interior Department was the largest bureaucracy in the federal government, including numerous patronage positions. Running the department required knowledge of dissimilar duties, and the ability to master complex details. During Delano&#x27;s time as secretary, he faced several critical issues and his department was rapidly expanding; despite the challenges he served longer in the job than any other 19th-century incumbent. Delano aligned himself with Grant&#x27;s private secretary Orville Babcock and Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. Delano rejected the civil service reforms of his predecessor Cox and reverted the Interior to the spoils system.

====Bison slaughter (1870s)====
During the Civil War, Union generals practiced a &quot;scorched earth&quot; campaign against Confederate infrastructure that destroyed its vital food supplies, which aided in bringing about the Union&#x27;s victory. During the late 1860s and early 1870s U.S. Army officers William T. Sherman, Richard Dodge, and Secretary of the Interior Delano adopted a similar strategy against Native Americans in the west, whose primary food supply was free-roaming bison. Dodge said in 1867, &quot;Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone.&quot; Delano said in an 1872 annual report, &quot;The rapid disappearance of the game [bison] from the former hunting-grounds must operate largely in favor of our efforts to confine the Indians to smaller areas, and compel them to abandon their nomadic customs.&quot;

Much of the destruction of bison was done by private, for-profit buffalo hunters; this policy allowed the slaughter of millions of bison on the American plains, forcing Indians to move to and remain on their reservations. The few free-roaming bison left in Yellowstone were protected from poaching by a federal law passed in 1872; during Delano&#x27;s tenure, mounting criticism by the public forced Congress to pass legislation that would stop the bison slaughter on the plains. Grant vetoed the legislation in 1874, accepting that the bison slaughter was accomplishing the goal of pacifying the Indians. From 1872 to 1874 the Indians killed approximately 1,215,000 bison as part of providing for their food, shelter, and other basic needs; American hunters slaughtered an estimated 4,374,000 bison, reducing the population to the point that it could not reproduce normally and continue to sustain the Indians.

====Apache massacre and peace (1871–1872)====

On April 30, 1871, Tucson townspeople organized a militia, consisting of 6 Americans, 48 Mexicans and 94 Tohono O&#x27;odham Indians, which massacred 144 members of an Apache Indian settlement at Camp Grant, mostly women and children. Twenty-eight children were kidnapped by the militia and held as ransom for the Apache warriors, who were not present at the time of the massacre. The people of Tucson drew national attention by the scale of their activity, resulting in Eastern philanthropists and President Grant denouncing their actions. Arizona citizens, however, believed the killings were justified and claimed that Apache warriors had killed mail runners and settlers near Tucson. President Grant sent Major General George Crook to keep the peace in Arizona; many Apaches had joined the U.S. military for protection.

On November 10, 1871, Delano advocated Grant that Apaches be given new reservation land in Arizona and New Mexico, following the recommendation of Indian Peace Commissioner Vincent Colyer to find them a location where they could be protected from attacks by white settlers. Delano advocated that all Apaches be put on reservations including young men and warriors, who were forming raiding parties, rather than just their old men and women. Grant sent Major General Oliver Otis Howard to Arizona to help resolve the issue; Howard organized a peace conference with Apache leader Eskiminzin in May 1872 at Camp Grant. Howard also negotiated the release of six of the captive Apache children. In December 1872, the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, a permanent settlement, was established at the junction of the San Carlos and Gila Rivers, the location having been agreed upon by Howard and Eskiminzin. In October 1872, Howard also made a separate peace treaty with the Apache leader Cochise, who settled on the Chiricahua reservation.

====Akerman feud (1871)====
In June 1871 Grant&#x27;s Attorney General Amos T. Akerman denied land and bond grants to the Union Pacific Railroad, a company connected to the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Ackerman&#x27;s anti-railroad rulings were protested by railroad financiers Collis P. Huntington and Jay Gould. Akerman was also instrumental in prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan in the South and protecting African American civil rights. Railroad interests and African-American civil rights had been priorities for the Republican Party; on behalf of Huntington and Gould, Delano twice asked Akerman to change rulings that had gone against the Union Pacific, and both times Akerman refused. Delano then complained to Grant and suggested that Akerman should be removed. Grant agreed, and named former Oregon Senator George H. Williams as Akerman&#x27;s replacement; Williams was seen as more favorable to railroad interests. On the issue of curtailing the Klan prosecutions, according to historian William S. McFeely, &quot;[w]ith Akerman&#x27;s departure on January 10, 1872, went any hope that the Republican party would develop as a national party of true racial equality.&quot;

====Yellowstone (1871–1872)====

In 1871, Delano organized America&#x27;s first federally funded scientific expedition into Yellowstone, which was headed by U.S. Geologist Ferdinand V. Hayden. Delano gave specific instructions for Hayden to make a geographical map of the area and to make astronomical and barometric observations. Delano stated that Hayden&#x27;s expedition was directed to &quot;...secure as much information as possible, both scientific and practical...give your attention to the geological, mineralogical, zoological, botanical, and agricultural resources of the country.&quot; Delano also ordered Hayden to gather information on Native American tribes who lived in the area. Hayden&#x27;s expedition was outfitted by an extensive scientific team that included two botanists, a meteorologist, a zoologist, an ornithologist, a mineralogist, a topographer, an artist, a photographer, a physician, hunters, mule teams and ambulances, and a support staff.

On March 1, 1872 Ulysses S. Grant signed the &quot;Organic Act&quot;, incorporating Hayden&#x27;s findings and discoveries and creating Yellowstone, the world&#x27;s first national park. The law provided that the Secretary of the Interior exercise &quot;exclusive control&quot; over Yellowstone; As Delano was the incumbent, this made him the first overseer of the first national park in the world. The poaching of fish and wildlife, including bison, was forbidden, and Delano was authorized to preserve the &quot;natural curiosities and wonders&quot; found inside the park. Delano was now in charge of millions of acres of land, however, he was not provided any funding to care for it. Instead, he was given the power to grant 10-year leases in order to raise money to pay for maintaining the park. As soon as the park was created, Delano was inundated by requests for hotel concessions, and he also had to determine the control and use of existing facilities in the park&#x27;s northern section.

Delano appointed N. P. Langford the first Supervisor of Yellowstone in 1872; Langford banned private toll roads and submitted a plan to build and maintain a park road system free to the public, but Congress refused to fund it. Congress also refused to give Langford a stipend, so he had to supplement his livelihood by working as a banker. In 1874 Lanford requested that Delano petition Congress for appropriations to protect the park from poachers, unlicensed privateers, and trespassers. Delano agreed and demanded Congress appropriate $100,000 to set up a federal park agency to administer and protect the park for the public, and also asked for an increase in the terms of the concession leases from 10 to 20 years. The proposal was turned down; it was not until April 1877, during the Rutherford B. Hayes administration, that Congress appropriated one-tenth of Delano&#x27;s request, $10,000, (~$ in ) without any federal protection agency for the park.

====Defied Civil Service Executive order (1871–1874)====
In March 1871, Grant signed into law Congressional legislation that established the United States Civil Service Commission, designed to create reform rules and to regulate and reduce corruption in the federal workforce. Implementation of the rules was left to the discretion of the President. Grant appointed New York reformer William Curtis to chair the commission. The Commission reported that appointments and promotions would be controlled by examiners, and each federal department would create a board of examiners, while political assessments would be abolished. Grant ordered the implementation of the rules to be effective on January 1, 1872. Grant dissolved the commission in 1874 after Congress refused to make the Commission rules permanent, and refused to provide permanent funding for the commission. Congressional interest in civil service reform would remain dormant until 1883.

Under Article 12 of Grant&#x27;s executive order, Land Office and Pension agent applicants in the Department of Interior were to be approved by a board of examiners. Delano, however, betrayed Grant and defied the order. Grant made no response. The Interior Department&#x27;s varied and diverse responsibilities increased at a rapid rate and became a source of numerous administrative problems. For the department head, controlling the bureaus and shaping policy was a daunting task; Delano argued that the complexities of the department made implementing civil service reform impractical. Under Delano&#x27;s tenure, corruption permeated the whole department, including bogus agents in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and thieving clerks in the Patent Office. Delano ultimately resigned because of evidence that surveying contracts had been awarded to companies in which his son John, the chief clerk of the department, and Orvil (or Orville) Grant, the president&#x27;s brother, had ownership interests; this was more or less permissible by the standards of the day, but to reform-minded individuals, including the editors of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; and other newspapers, it represented a conflict of interest and breach of the public trust.

====Supported Ku Klux Klan prosecutions (1872)====
To bolster the Reconstruction Acts and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth constitutional amendments, Grant signed in 1870 Congressional legislation that created the Justice Department. To fight the outrages in the South by the Ku Klux Klan, Grant signed several laws known as the Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871. In May 1871, Grant ordered federal troops to help U.S. Marshals in arresting Klansmen. Grant&#x27;s second Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, a former Confederate soldier, knew of the outrages of the Klan and was zealous in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors. That October, on Akerman&#x27;s recommendation, Grant suspended &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops there to enforce the law. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan&#x27;s power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers.

In a campaign speech supporting President Grant&#x27;s reelection bid in Raleigh, North Carolina, on July 24, 1872, Delano spoke out in favor of prosecutions of the Ku Klux Klan. Delano argued that the Congressional Reconstruction Acts had been passed to &quot;rescue order and government out of the chaos and confusion&quot; that came from the Civil War. This included the enfranchisement of African Americans, most of them former slaves, who had been set &quot;forever free&quot; as a result of the war. Delano stated that if freedom meant anything it was that African Americans &quot;should stand equal before the law and have a voice in legislation.&quot; According to Delano, southerners who rejected Republican Reconstruction opted for a subversive war against African Americans and white Republicans, including the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Delano said the Ku Klux Klan had in fourteen North Carolina counties killed 18 people and cruelly whipped 315 Republicans who had done nothing wrong. Delano said that evidence presented in prosecuting Klan members in the federal courts proved the &quot;barbarity and treason&quot; of the Ku Klux Klan. Grant ended up winning North Carolina and many other Southern states.

====Defined Indian policy (1873)====
In 1873, Delano formally defined the methods to be used in attaining the goals of Grant&#x27;s policy toward the Native Americans. Grant&#x27;s ultimate goal was to convert the Indians to Christianity and assimilate them into the white culture in order to prepare them for full U.S. Citizenship; these fundamental principles continued to influence Indian Peace policy for the rest of the 19th Century. According to Delano, relocating the Indians to reservations was of primary importance, since this would supposedly protect them from the violence of white settlers as whites moved onto lands previously held by Native Americans. In addition, Christian organizations and missionaries operating on these reservations could &quot;civilize&quot; the Native Americans, in line with the widespread belief (including Delano&#x27;s) that allowing the Indians to continue to practice their own culture would lead to their destruction. In Delano&#x27;s view, his actions would accomplish Grant&#x27;s goal by facilitating Indian assimilation into white culture.

====Black Hills take over (1875)====

Under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the Oglala Sioux had been given a huge reservation including the Black Hills in what is now South Dakota. The Black Hills were the site of Sioux sacred religious rituals and spiritual ceremonies. Following the Panic of 1873 the country was desperate for new wealth. In 1874 rumors spread of gold being discovered in the Black Hills by George Custer&#x27;s recent expedition. Grant sent the expedition, hoping to find gold in order to support his species currency policy; Delano opposed the move, believing travel through and eventual occupation of hunting grounds violated the Treaty of Fort Laramie and could lead to an Indian war. Delano told Grant that a &quot;general war with the Sioux would be deplorable. It would undo the good already accomplished by our efforts for peaceable relations.&quot; Whites immediately flocked to the area in search of gold; in 1875, Congress appropriated $25,000 (~$ in ) for the purchase of the Black Hills, hoping that a cash payment would assuage the Sioux and prevent war.

In mid-May 1875, Red Cloud, Chief of the Oglala Lakota (Sioux), and other Indian tribal leaders were brought to Washington D.C. to negotiate the sale of the Black Hills. The Sioux believed the amount offered by Congress was too low; recognizing that they would eventually lose the Black Hills, Red Cloud decided to negotiate and told Delano they would sign away the Black Hills if $25,000 in cash was first drawn from the Treasury Department, to ensure that the Sioux would be paid. Delano had no intention of giving Red Cloud cash, but rather a receipt for $25,000 from the Treasury and additional presents purchased at a later date and distributed to members of the tribe. Red Cloud insisted that he wanted the $25,000 in cash at the signing, which would be taken home and divided among the members of the tribe.

Delano warned Grant that a war would likely break out if negotiations were not successful. When negotiations broke down, Grant was brought into the process to bargain directly with Red Cloud. Grant told Red Cloud that the Black Hills had no buffalo, so it would benefit the Indians to accept payment because they would at least receive something of value in consideration for signing away valueless hunting rights. He also informed Red Cloud that whites were going to take over the Black Hills anyway, so it would be best not to leave empty-handed. Concerned that they would not be paid if they signed an agreement first, Red Cloud asked Grant to withdraw the money from the Treasury and hold it until after the signing. Grant refused and walked out, telling Red Cloud he had to sign over the Black Hills before any payment was made. On June 4, Delano offered Red Cloud an additional $25,000 in appropriations, but Red Cloud refused.

With Red Cloud&#x27;s refusal, Delano reluctantly let the Indians take the unsigned agreement back to their tribal agencies for further discussion among the members of the tribe, with final terms and signatures to be negotiated later by an appointed commission. The failure of the Washington, D.C. negotiations to produce an agreement was lampooned in the June 19 edition of &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;. Upon their return to Sioux country, Red Cloud and other Lakota leaders finally signed away their hunting rights to the Black Hills under Article 11 of the Treaty of Fort Laramie in exchange for the original $25,000 Congressional appropriation. Another group of Sioux chiefs, including Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, challenged Red Cloud&#x27;s authority and started the armed resistance about which Delano had warned Grant. This challenge to Red Cloud&#x27;s authority combined with Lakota unhappiness over white encroachment into the Black Hills resulted in the Great Sioux War, which started in February 1876.

====Resignation and corruption (1875)====
In 1875, Delano&#x27;s reputation for personal honesty came under increasing scrutiny as revelations of corruption in the Grant administration continued to be the subject of investigations and media revelations. Although Delano himself was not known to be personally corrupt, his tenure was shadowed by controversy, while fraud prevailed in his Interior Department. There were accusations of an &quot;Indian Ring&quot; and corrupt agents who exploited Native American people. Westerners unhappy with Delano&#x27;s rulings on land grants and other issues accused Delano&#x27;s son John, an employee of the Interior Department, of corruption, bribery, and fraud in the Wyoming Territory.

=====Surveyor General Ring=====
The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; reported that John Delano was profiteering through Interior&#x27;s Office of the Surveyor-General by accepting partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts without having been trained in surveying or map-making, and without providing any meaningful contribution to the fulfillment of the contracts; the obvious implication was John Delano had taken extortion money from illicit contract agreements. In March 1875, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor&#x27;s Office, L. C. Stevens, wrote to Benjamin Bristow, Grant&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury, stating that Surveyor General Silas Reed had made several corrupt contracts which financially benefited John Delano. Stevens also said both Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for $5,000. According to Stevens, Reed and Delano had coerced the deputy surveyors to pay John Delano before he would release the Interior Department warrants for land the deputy surveyors had sold to prospective settlers. Governor Edward M. McCook of the Colorado Territory, claimed that John Delano had accepted a $1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior. More damaging was Stevens&#x27; charge that Columbus Delano knew and approved of what Reed had done for John Delano.

In addition to Delano&#x27;s son, Grant&#x27;s brother Orvil was paid for surveying services in the Wyoming Territory, although Orvil did no work. The chief clerk of the Cheyenne branch of the federal Surveying Office testified before Congress concerning Orvil. When asked whether Orvil did any work in the Wyoming Territory, the chief clerk said, &quot;No, sir, I do not think he was ever in the territory.&quot; 

=====Indian Ring=====
In July 1875, Delano was rumored to know that Orvil Grant, the president&#x27;s brother, had received Indian trading posts, that were a corrupt source of lucrative kickbacks, from the sutler, at the expense of the Indians and soldiers. The higher the sale price on goods, that the Indians and soldiers would pay, the higher the profits. Even the sale of rifles to hostile Indian tribes was allowed, to make more money. The profits were split and sent to the other sutler partners.

Delano was rumored to have threatened Grant at Long Branch that he would expose Orvil to the public when Delano&#x27;s resignation was enforced. He told Grant that he would quietly leave office after Congressional Indian fraud investigations were complete. In February 1876, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; reported that Orvil made money in the Sioux country by &quot;starving the squaws and children.&quot; Orvil testified before Congress that Grant had influenced the War Department to get him traderships. Orvil received rights to operate four trading posts, then set up &quot;partners&quot; who kicked back half their profits to Orvil. Though Orvil claimed Grant had not known of the kickbacks, he expressed no remorse for his corruption, and his testimony left Grant embarrassed.

The kingpin of this Indian Ring was not Delano, but Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who was given legal authority by Congress in 1870 to appoint sutlers to traderships at Army posts near Indian reservations, which were controlled by Interior. Belknap, who had awarded Orvil Grant the four traderships, took advantage of the law to personally profit by arranging an illicit partnership at Fort Sill between his wife Carrie, Caleb P. Marsh, and sutler John S. Evans. After Carrie&#x27;s death, Belknap married her sister Amanda, who continued the illicit tradership arrangement. Belknap&#x27;s household received as much as $20,000 in illegal profits (nearly $500,000 in 2021), which Belknap needed in order to finance the lavish Washington D.C. entertainment lifestyle expected of cabinet members and other prominent political figures.

Aware that the U.S. House was investigating him, on March 2, 1876, Belknap visited Grant and immediately resigned. The House continued its inquiry and found him guilty of five articles of impeachment. Grant&#x27;s attorney general placed Belknap under house arrest during his U.S. Senate trial. Though most senators believed the evidence of Belknap&#x27;s corruption, enough believed they lacked the jurisdiction to punish Belknap because he was no longer in office to acquit him. Despite escaping conviction, Belknap&#x27;s reputation was so marred that he never returned to political office.

=====Resignation=====
Both Bristow and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish demanded that Grant fire Delano. Grant declined, telling Fish, &quot;If Delano were now to resign, it would be retreating under fire and be accepted as an admission of the charges.&quot; The controversy did not abate; by mid-August, it became clear that Delano could not remain in office; Delano offered his resignation and Grant accepted, but Grant did not make it public. Grant finally announced his acceptance of Delano&#x27;s resignation on October 19, 1875, after Bristow threatened to resign if Delano was not replaced. Grant replaced Delano with Zachariah Chandler, who quickly initiated civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. Delano&#x27;s administration was investigated by Congress, Chandler, and a special presidential commission; his personal conduct was exonerated, but his reputation as an honest, capable administrator was damaged, and Delano never again ran for office or served in an appointed one. In April 1876, &quot;The Committee on the Expenditures in the Interior Department&quot; confirmed that Reed had set up an illicit slush fund for John Delano&#x27;s financial benefit and that Delano thanked Reed while also telling him &quot;to be careful to do nothing that would have the semblance of wrong.&quot;

=====Delano&#x27;s defense=====
On September 26, 1875, Delano submitted to Grant a letter defending his tenure at the Department of the Interior; in essence, he argued that the size and complexity of his department made it difficult to manage effectively. Delano stated that he had resigned because he intended to return to his business and domestic concerns in Ohio. He indicated that his duties as Secretary of the Interior were &quot;laborious, difficult, and delicate&quot; because he was required to supervise five disparate bureaus or offices: United States General Land Office; Indian; Pensions; Patent; and Education, in addition to &quot;a mass of miscellaneous business unknown to any except those connected to the public service.&quot;

Delano also reminded Grant that the Land Office dealt with complex railroad land grants, as well as issues resolving land titles in California, Arizona and New Mexico, because those areas had previously been under Spain&#x27;s and then Mexico&#x27;s jurisdiction. In addition, the Indian Bureau dealt with many &quot;intricate, delicate, and vexatious questions&quot; growing out of previous Indian treaties. Delano further informed Grant that when he had to decide issues between competing claimants, those he ruled against often gave false and misleading statements rather than accept their loss, which was to Delano&#x27;s detriment. Delano concluded by claiming a successful tenure, informing Grant that the Interior Department &quot;has never been in a more prosperous or better condition than it now is.&quot;

=====Chandler reforms=====

Delano&#x27;s successor, Zachariah Chandler, did not complain about his departmental duties and immediately investigated allegations of corruption. Chandler found things differently than Delano&#x27;s explanations to Grant and decided the department needed major reforming. During his first month in office, he fired all the clerks in one room of the Patent Office; he noted that every desk was vacant, and concluded that the employees were either involved in corruption or lacked the integrity to reform the department. Almost twenty employees were found to be entirely fictitious; they had been created by a profiteering ring to defraud the government by falsely receiving pay for work that was not performed. Chandler also fired unqualified clerks who profiteered by hiring out their work to lower-paid replacements and pocketing the salary difference.

In addition, Chandler simplified Patent Office rules, making patents easier to obtain and reducing the cost for applicants. In December 1875, Chandler banned persons known as &quot;Indian Attorneys&quot;, whose claims to represent Native Americans in Washington were questionable. He found the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be the most corrupt and replaced its commissioner and chief clerk. In addition to Indian Affairs, Chandler also investigated the Pension Bureau. This review resulted in the identification and removal of numerous fraudulent pensions, which saved the federal government hundreds of thousands of dollars. Chandler also revoked as many as 800 fraudulent land grants that had been approved during Delano&#x27;s tenure.

==Later life and career==
On his resignation from Grant&#x27;s cabinet, Delano returned to Mount Vernon where for the next twenty years he served as president of the First National Bank of Mount Vernon. He was a longtime trustee of Kenyon College, which awarded him the honorary degree of LL.D.; among his charitable and civic donations was his endowment of Kenyon&#x27;s Delano Hall; this building was in use until it was destroyed by a fire in 1906. His &quot;Lakehome&quot; mansion, built in 1871 at the outskirts of Mount Vernon, is now part of Mount Vernon Nazarene University.

On April 3, 1880, John W. Wright, a judge from Indiana, was convicted at trial of having assaulted Delano on a Washington, D.C. street corner on October 12, 1877. Wright, who had been an Indian Agent in the Interior Department while Delano was secretary, had been convicted of fraud and blamed Delano. On the day of the assault he was in the company of Walter H. Smith, formerly solicitor of the Department of the Interior; Wright was accused of provoking a fight by questioning Delano&#x27;s honesty as Secretary of the Interior and then striking Delano with his walking stick. Wright claimed that Delano had been verbally harassing him and that he then felt compelled to defend himself. Delano did not sustain serious injuries; Wright&#x27;s defense was weakened by witness testimony that after the assault, he claimed credit for it, and stated that he would have continued if passers-by had not intervened. Wright was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $1,000. On April 8, 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes pardoned Wright, with his release from custody conditional upon the payment of the fine.

On December 3, 1889, Delano was elected president of the National Wool Growers Association, a lobbying group organized to advocate for tariff protection of the national wool industry. The association had been formed in 1865, and became more active in the 1880s as a response to the decline in domestic wool production; wool growers faced increasing overseas competition and had gone from 50 million sheep producing wool in 1883 to 40 million in 1888.

==Death==
Delano died on October 23, 1896; he was interred at Mount Vernon&#x27;s Mound View Cemetery, Lot 42, Section 16, Grave 4. Delano&#x27;s death was sudden and unexpected, and took place at his &quot;Lakehome&quot; residence near Mount Vernon, at 11:00 AM. Delano&#x27;s wife had fallen and broken her hip on October 20, an accident unrelated to Delano&#x27;s death. She died in August 1897.

==Historical legacy ==
Delano&#x27;s career prior to becoming Secretary of the Interior was not known for any scandals, nor has he been implicated in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Historians, however, are critical of Delano&#x27;s overall tenure as Secretary of the Interior, especially for his loose anti-reform administrative style and for allowing corruption to permeate the department. As such, Delano was at odds with many of Grant&#x27;s other Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Attorney General Amos T. Akerman. The corruption under Delano in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency within the Interior Department, in particular eventually led to the end of agency being part of the political appointee and career civil servant systems and pushed it toward bureaucratization. Delano later defended his reputation by saying that the Interior Department was difficult to manage due to its expanding size and its many offices with disparate functions.

===Indian advancement===

In March 1869, President Grant appointed Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian, to commissioner of Indian Affairs serving under both Interior secretaries Cox and Delano. Although there was resistance to his appointment, the Senate confirmed Parker could legally hold office, and he was confirmed by the Senate. During Parker&#x27;s tenure, lasting until August 1871, Indian wars decreased significantly from 101 in 1869 to 58 in 1870.

In 2021, some 145 years after Delano left office in 1875, the position of secretary of the interior was first filled by a Native American. On December 17, 2020, president-elect Joe Biden announced that he would nominate Deb Haaland to serve as secretary of the interior. She was confirmed by the Senate on March 15, 2021, by a vote of 51–40. Following her swearing-in on March 16, she became the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and the second to serve in the Cabinet, after Republican former vice president and Kaw Nation citizen Charles Curtis.

===Bison slaughter and Indian suppression===
Delano has also received criticism for allowing millions of bison to be slaughtered, with the exception of Yellowstone, in order to compel the Indians to move to and remain on their reservations, a policy approved by President Grant and the U.S. Army. The demise of the bison herds during Delano&#x27;s tenure led to the destruction of the Plains Indian culture, including their economy, cosmology, and religion. Without the bison, the Plains Indians could not resist late 19th-century expansionism, including the development of the railroads in the American West. This policy led to more restrictive measures against Native Americans in the 1880s and 1890s, including the banning of medicine making, polygamy, bride payments, and the Sun Dance. 

===Yellowstone and bison recovery===
Delano was the first Secretary of the Interior to be in charge of Yellowstone, America&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s first national park. The charges of misconduct and lax management made during Delano&#x27;s tenure at the Interior did not include the new park, the management of which was seen as a success. Among its features, it outlawed poaching wildlife and served as a haven for small numbers of free-roaming bison, left after the slaughter of the great herds that, with the exception of Yellowstone, Delano had fully supported. On August 25, 1916, Congress created the National Park Service to federally protect and administer Yellowstone and other national parks; Delano had proposed the creation of the agency in 1874. Yellowstone today generates around 4 million visitors per year.

By 1902, poachers had illegally killed and reduced Yellowstone bison herd size to about two dozen animals. The U.S. Army, which administered Yellowstone, prior to the creation of the National Park Service, took over and protected the last remaining bison from further poaching. Bison from private herds were incorporated into Yellowstone, forming a northern herd. For decades, however, as Yellowstone bisons increased in number, herds were reduced, believing the animals had caused overgrazing. The practice of reducing the Yellowstone bison population ceased in 1968. However, by the 2000s, the reduction of Yellowstone bison herds resumed, &quot;due to increasing numbers and litigation about migration into Montana.&quot; As of August 2019, Yellowstone had 4,829 bison from two herds, 3,667 northern bison, and 1,162 central bison.

===Corruption aftermath and the Pendleton Act===

In the aftermath of Delano&#x27;s departure and retirement from the Interior in 1875 and Chandler reforms, the large department still experienced scandals but was much less pervasive than during Delano&#x27;s tenure. During the Rutherford B. Hayes administration, on May 31, 1880, a Senate committee reported on the Interior Department and Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, a reformer, over his removal and jailing of the Ponca Indians. On December 18, 1880, a commission appointed Hayes, began an investigation of the department&#x27;s treatment of the Ponca. On January 25, 1881, the commission reported to President Hayes the treatment of the Ponca was &quot;needlessly disastrous and cruel&quot;.

In January 1883, President Arthur signed into law the landmark legislation, known as the Pendleton Act, that made civil service reform permanent, with the goal to reduce corruption and hire persons based on a merit system, rather than patronage. Patterned off Grant&#x27;s Civil Service Commission (&quot;1871&quot;) and rules, the Act put 11 percent of the federal workforce under civil service law, and reestablished the Civil Service Commission, to regulate political assessments and payoffs. Good men were appointed by Arthur to run the commission, and surprisingly, Arthur was friendly to reformers. The passage of the act was motivated by the assassination of President James A. Garfield by a disgruntled office seeker. 

Scandals continued to periodically surface. In 1884, William W. Dudley, Commissioner of the Pensions Office, was engaged in political activity, promising expedited approval to petitioners who voted for James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, the Republicans President and Vice President candidates. President Chester A. Arthur, a Republican, did nothing to stop the practice. In 1888, Secretary of Interior William F. Vilas, appointed by President Grover Cleveland (&quot;1885-1889&quot;), a Democrat, was investigated by Congress. Vilas was a stockholder of the Superior Lumber Company and was suspected of profiteering. In 1889, the Senate investigation report concluded that Vilas did not personally profiteer.

During the Benjamin Harrison Republican administration (&quot;1889-1893&quot;), an Interior probe investigation found evidence Harrison&#x27;s appointed Pension Bureau Commissioner James R. Tanner took &quot;lavish and illegal handouts&quot;. Tanner resigned and Harrison appointed Green B. Raum Pension Bureau Commissioner. Raum was accused of taking kickback loans to expedite pension cases. A Democratic House investigation said Raum had &quot;prostituted his office&quot; and should be removed, but Harrison declined. 

===Personal reputation===
In 1898, historian Joseph Patterson Smith said Delano had attained, &quot;a long and distinguished career, as an eminent lawyer, an able businessman and one intimately identified with the governmental affairs of the state and nation.&quot; In 2001, historian Jean Edward Smith, taking a harsher view, said Delano betrayed his public trust while Secretary of the Interior by allowing corruption to pervade throughout his department, &quot;at the expense of those who most needed government assistance: the Native American.&quot; Benjamin Bristow, Grant&#x27;s appointed Secretary of Treasury, said Secretary Delano was &quot;a very mean dog,&quot; and deserved &quot;the execration of every honest man.&quot;

===Honors===
====Delano, California====
Delano, California, located in Kern County, originally a terminal railroad town, was founded on July 14, 1869. The unnamed town was officially named in honor of Columbus Delano, at the time Delano was Secretary of the Interior, during the Grant administration. The name of Delano was officially given by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Delano&#x27;s first post office opened in 1874. The town of Delano was incorporated as a city in 1915.

====Mountains====
Certain mountains in Utah (Delano Peak) and Montana (Mount Delano) are named after Delano. Delano Peak, in Utah, has an elevation of 12,174 ft (3,711 m). Mount Delano, in Montana, has an elevation of 10,138 ft (3090 m).

<doc id="782755" wikidata="Q2540624" url="?curid=782755" title="Waikanae">
<text>Waikanae (, ) is a town on the Kāpiti Coast, north of the Wellington, New Zealand. The name is a Māori word meaning &quot;waters&quot; (&quot;wai&quot;) &quot;of the grey mullet&quot;.

The area surrounding the town is notable for its beach, the Waikanae River estuary, the Kapiti Marine Reserve, and Kapiti Island, which lies offshore in the Tasman Sea. The town is considered one of the top retirement destinations in the Wellington Region, because of it having year-round mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and less wind than Wellington.

The town is northeast of Paraparaumu, and southwest of Ōtaki. The Waikanae railway station is the northernmost station in the Metlink passenger rail network, linking with Wellington railway station in Central Wellington.

==Geography==
Waikanae lies in a setting of open farmland and forest between the Tasman Sea and the rugged Tararua Range. Prior to human settlement the Waikanae coastal plain comprised wetlands divided by a complex pattern of natural waterways and kohekohe wooded regions. 

Together with its neighbouring settlement of Waikanae Beach, the town comprises a quiet locale, popular with families and retirees. Just north of Waikanae is the small community of Peka Peka.

The area surrounding the town is notable for its beach, the Waikanae River estuary and Kapiti Island, which lies offshore in the Tasman Sea. Waikanae Beach is approximately long from the Waikanae River estuary to the Waimeha Stream. The eastern section of the Kapiti Marine Reserve lies between Kapiti Island and Waikanae Beach, and adjoins the Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve. Whales and Hector&#x27;s dolphins are sometimes spotted on their migration routes through the narrow corridor. 

Inland, to the east of Waikanae are the bush clad Hemi Matenga Reserve, the Tararua Ranges and the Akatarawa Valley, home to a conservation park, Staglands Wildlife Reserve &amp; Cafe. A road through the valley over the Akatarawa Saddle provides a link with the Hutt Valley via Reikorangi and Cloustonville. The headwaters of the Waikanae River form where a number of streams converge in the inland Reikorangi Basin. From here the river runs through a gap in the foothills, across the coastal plain and sand dunes to the sea.

===Climate===
The Tararua Range provides shelter for Waikanae from the south and east, as does Kapiti Island from the west. The area accordingly escapes the heavy winds and storms of the neighbouring Cook Strait region. The shallow depths of Waikanae Beach produces a higher water temperature than the steeper coastlines of Wellington harbour to the south. The prevailing wind blows from the north-west, which drives rain-clouds inland to the ranges and results in high rainfalls during the winter and spring.

==History and culture==
Archaeological and ethnographical research suggests that Waikanae may have been first inhabited by the Waitaha moa-hunters as early as a thousand years ago. Successive waves of settlement by the Ngāti Apa, Rangitāne and Muaūpoko Iwi (tribal groups) ensured that the area continues to have major historic and mythological significance for the Māori people of New Zealand. See Kāpiti Coast for greater detail.

In 1824 Waikanae Beach was the embarkation point for a force of 2,000 to 3,000 fighters from coastal Iwi, who assembled with the intention of taking Kapiti Island from the Ngāti Toa led by Te Rauparaha. Crossing the strait in a fleet of waka canoes under shelter of darkness, the attackers were met and destroyed as they disembarked at the northern end of Kapiti Island.

===Marae===
Whakarongotai Marae is located in Waikanae. It is a marae (social and cultural meeting ground) for Te Atiawa ki Whakarongotai and includes the Whakarongotai or Puku Mahi Tamariki wharenui (meeting house).

== Reserves ==

Waikanae Beach is a habitat for terns, seagulls, oystercatchers, and stilts. Inland wetlands provide habitat for pūkeko, crake and New Zealand dabchicks. White fronted herons, tūī and shags range across the coastal plain. The ready availability of both birdlife and seafood encouraged early Māori settlement of the area. Introduced species such as ducks and black swans have also flourished over the last century.

=== Wildlife reserves ===
The Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve is a nationally–significant reserve located at the mouth of the Waikanae River. The reserve was established in 1987 to protect the large number of bird species that use the area.

Ngā Manu Nature Reserve is a reserve located north of the town. It preserves the largest remnant of coastal lowland swamp forest on the Kāpiti Coast, and is a popular visitor attraction. Pharazyn Reserve is located to the north of the Waikanae Beach settlement, adjacent to the Te Harakeke Swamp, a regionally significant area of harakeke and raupō wetland. The site was originally established as a sewage treatment plant in the 1970s, but was decommissioned in 2002. A long term environmental restoration project was commenced to restore the site as a recreation and wildlife reserve. The site is now described as one of the top 10 birdwatching sites in the Wellington region.

=== Hemi Matenga Memorial Scenic Reserve ===
To the east of Waikanae is the heavily forested Hemi Matenga Reserve covering a range overlooking the town itself. Rising to 514 metres above sea level, the forest comprises one of the most extensive areas of kohekohe woodland left in New Zealand. The reserve was named after its former owner; Hemi Matenga Waipunahau of the Ngāti Toa, following his death in 1912. It is traversed by several walking tracks and forms an extension of the Tararua Range.

==Demographics==
Waikanae is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a larger boundary, including Peka Peka and covering . Using that boundary, Waikanae had a population of 12,711 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,605 people (14.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,148 people (20.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 5,460 households, comprising 5,853 males and 6,858 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.85 males per female, with 1,881 people (14.8%) aged under 15 years, 1,344 (10.6%) aged 15 to 29, 4,845 (38.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 4,632 (36.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.9% European/Pākehā, 9.2% Māori, 2.1% Pasifika, 4.5% Asian, and 2.0% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 24.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 48.8% had no religion, 41.3% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,766 (25.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,635 (15.1%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,938 people (17.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,011 (37.0%) people were employed full-time, 1,482 (13.7%) were part-time, and 279 (2.6%) were unemployed.

It was forecast in 2012 that Waikanae&#x27;s relative abundance of unoccupied land and recent or pending improvements in transport links will lead to a population increase to about 15,000 by 2032.

== Government ==
Local government for the town is provided by the Kāpiti Coast District Council. Waikanae is one of the five electoral wards of the District Council. The Waikanae Community Board represents the area from Waikanae Downs in the south through to Te Horo in the north. The community board has an advocacy role, and also administers local grant funding.

Greater Wellington Regional Council is responsible for regional governance of the district and the wider region, including public transport, water and environmental management.

==Facilities==
The central Waikanae village includes two supermarkets, the Toi Mahara gallery, three bank branches, a health centre, three pharmacies, a post shop, a war memorial hall, a smaller community hall, the Kapiti Coast Museum, a church, a public library, a cinema and a number of other shops, restaurants, and businesses. There are two primary schools (see below), a golf course, bowling club, Waikanae Park rugby and cricket ground, and several retirement centres.

Mahara Gallery is an art gallery opened in 1996. It was renovated in 2023 and renamed &quot;Toi Mahara&quot;.

Te Araroa (the country&#x27;s long-distance walking trail) leads through Waikanae.

==Housing==

Waikanae is the largest of the 14 residential suburbs which lie within the Territorial Authority of the Kāpiti Coast, in terms of the total number of residential properties. The greater portion of Waikanae&#x27;s houses were constructed during the period 1970–1979.

Development of numerous private gardens has led at one point to Waikanae having one of the highest levels of water consumption per head of population in New Zealand. The community draws its water from the single source of the Waikanae River, and seasonal shortages during the warmer months of the year constitute a growing problem for the area. Planning for new residential development has specifically included the need to meet water supply needs.

==Transport==
 The town is located on State Highway 1 and the North Island Main Trunk railway. In February 2017 the Kāpiti Expressway was opened to enable State Highway 1 to bypass the centre of the township. The opening of the Transmission Gully Motorway increased accessibility to the town for commuters travelling to and from Wellington.

The town is the current northern terminus of the Kapiti Line for the Metlink commuter rail service. This service has operated since February 2011, into the newly rebuilt Waikanae Railway Station. The new Matangi electric multiple units entered service at the same time in 2011. Prior to that, the only direct commuter train to Wellington was the Capital Connection from Palmerston North which still leaves for Wellington in the morning and returns in the evening &quot;en route&quot; to Palmerston North.

Local bus services link Waikanae Village with Waikanae Beach and Ōtaki.

==Local media==
A radio station Beach FM 106.3 broadcasts from Waikanae Village, covering the Kāpiti and Horowhenua districts. Two local newspapers provide coverage of the Kāpiti region.

==Education==
Waikanae School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

Kapakapanui School is also a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of .

<text>The Cadillac CTS is a luxury car, manufactured and marketed by General Motors from 2003 until 2019 across three generations. 

Initially available as a 4-door sedan using the GM Sigma platform, GM offered the second generation CTS in 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, and 5-door sport wagon, and the third generation as a sedan, using a stretched version of the GM Alpha platform. High performance sedan variants were offered for each generation, as the CTS-V—with wagon and coupe variants offered for the second generation.

In a 2003 report titled &quot;The 90 days that shaped Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Automotive News&quot; noted that the first generation CTS marked a $4B investment by General Motors to set a new course for Cadillac styling, introduce a new rear-drive platform, and importantly, re-establish the brand&#x27;s relevancy. 

Wayne Cherry and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS, marking the production debut of a design language marketed as &quot;Art and Science,&quot; first used on the Evoq concept car. John Manoogian III directed the second generation CTS design, as initially conceived by Robert Munson. Bob Boniface and Robin Krieg designed the exterior of the third generation CTS.

The CTS ended production in 2019 and was replaced by the CT5, which shared its platform with the third and final generation of the CTS in addition to the smaller CT4.

== First generation (2003) ==
Introduced in January 2002 as a 2003 model, the CTS sedan used GM&#x27;s new rear-wheel drive Sigma platform and a fully independent suspension. It was the first Cadillac offered with a manual transmission since the 1988 Cimarron. All models were manufactured at GM&#x27;s Lansing Grand River Assembly in Lansing, Michigan.

The CTS replaced the Opel-based Catera, the acronym &quot;CTS&quot; standing for Catera Touring Sedan. Wayne Cherry and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS, from a sketch drawn by Robert Munson, selected by Michael Simcoe and developed into a model by Paul Sciluna. 

The coupe marked the production debut of Cadillac&#x27;s design language, marketed as &quot;Art and Science,&quot; first seen on the Evoq concept—what noted automotive journalist Dan Neil described as a &quot;fractal geometric style.&quot; Neil described the CTS, saying &quot;the design is confident, distinctive and pure.&quot; Writing in the New York Times, Neil noted &quot;this is a serious automobile, a car of consequence. In its 100th year and at the 11th hour, Cadillac made a brave investment in the supremacy of design, in the idea that cleverness should be cloaked in beauty.&quot;

Originally powered by a 3.2 L LA3 V6 producing , the CTS received an updated 3.6 L DOHC V6 with variable valve timing as an option in 2004, producing and of torque. The 3.2 L engine went out of production in 2005, when a new 2.8 L version of the DOHC V6 debuted in an entry-level version of the CTS. In Europe, the 2.8 L replaced the previous entry-level 2.6 L engine.

The CTS was originally offered with either GM&#x27;s in-house five-speed 5L40-E automatic transmission or a five-speed Getrag 260 manual transmission. For the 2005 model year, the Getrag was replaced with an Aisin AY-6 six-speed.

In 2004, GM introduced the CTS-V, a high-performance version of the CTS intended to compete with luxury performance sedans like the BMW M3/M5, Audi S4/S6, and Mercedes-Benz C and E-class AMGs. The 2004 and 2005 CTS-Vs were equipped with the 5.7L LS6 V-8 ( at 6,000 rpm, at 4,800 rpm), a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission, 14+&quot; rotors and Brembo 4-piston calipers front and rear, suspension upgrades (higher spring rates, stiffer anti-roll bars, six-lug hubs, and two available damper packages), and subtle exterior changes. As the LS6 was phased out, the 2006 and 2007 CTS-Vs received the 6.0L LS2 V-8, which carried the same HP and torque ratings (with peak torque coming 400 rpm sooner).

A prototype first generation CTS station wagon was created but never manufactured.


=== CTS-V (2004–2007) ===
====Chassis====

The first generation CTS-V is based on the same rear-wheel-drive GM Sigma platform as is the base model CTS. The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added. The spring rate was significantly increased. The 2006–2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and half shaft design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, six-lug hubs instead of the regular CTS&#x27;s five-lug units, and 18×8.5 inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar run-flat tires. Brakes were rotors in the front, with rotors in the rear - each with four-piston Brembo calipers on the front and rear wheels. In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.

====Engine====
The CTS sedan is enhanced with GM performance parts like a GM LS engine V8 from the C5-generation Chevrolet Corvette Z06, as well as the Corvette Z06&#x27;s six-speed Tremec manual transmission gear ratios. From 2004 and 2005, the CTS-V came with the 5.7 L pushrod OHV LS6 engine producing at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm. The torque reduction of the CTS-V vs the LS6 used in the C5 Z06, was due to the exhaust manifold that needed to be used on the CTS-V. From 2006 to 2007, the previous LS6 engine was superseded by the new 6.0 L OHV LS2 engine as used in the base 2005 Chevrolet Corvette. The new LS2 engine was rated at the same at 6,000 rpm with the peak torque of at 4,400 rpm. While both engines offer the same HP and torque specifications, the LS2&#x27;s benefit was a wider torque band, due to the higher displacement it offered.

====Transmission====
The only available transmission was the six-speed manual Tremec T56. The transmission used the skip-shift feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers from using the second and third gears, and a dual mass flywheel to reduce &quot;rattle&quot; in no load conditions. The rear axle was a Getrag limited slip IRS unit with a 3.73:1 ratio.

====Performance====
General Motors states a 0– time of 4.6 seconds for the first generation CTS-V, with the quarter mile time estimated at 13.1 seconds at , onward to a stated top speed of . The 14 inch diameter Brembo brakes can slow the vehicle from in 110 feet. The first generation CTS-V also posted a lap time of 8 minutes 19 seconds at Germany&#x27;s famed Nürburgring Nordschleife, competitive with rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG and BMW M5.

== Second generation (2008) ==
GM presented the 2008 CTS at the North American International Auto Show in January 2007. The 2008–2009 base model featured a 3.6 L LY7 V6 with and of torque carried over from the previous generation. A second engine, a new 3.6 L direct-injection V6 VVT engine with and of torque was also offered. For 2010, the base engine changed to a 3.0L variable valve timing (VVT) V6 with and of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on the second generation CTS and GM&#x27;s 6-speed Hydra-matic 6L50 automatic transmission was available as an option on all variants. On-demand all-wheel drive was offered with both engines when equipped with an automatic transmission. Suspension, braking, and steering improvements from the previous generation CTS-V were designed into the new standard CTS.

The second generation CTS was wider and longer than the original, measuring long, wide and in height. Wheelbase remained unchanged at , but with a wider front/rear track of . Other changes included revised exterior, grille, headlights and taillights, side air extractor vents located forward of the front doors, nine-spoke 18-inch wheels, and high-performance brake calipers and rotors. Available features on the second-gen CTS included a Bose 5.1 surround sound system, GM&#x27;s ESC system marketed as &quot;Stabiltrak&quot;, tire pressure monitoring system, navigation system with real-time traffic and weather data, integrated hard drive for music storage, swiveling headlights, and remote starting.

In 2008, General Motors anticipated relaunching the Cadillac brand in Australia and New Zealand with the second gen CTS, subsequently dropping the launch amidst the global financial crisis. As a result, the entire batch of cars, less one, which had already been shipped to Australia were transferred to New Zealand and sold via selected Holden New Zealand dealers. One dealer ended up buying the entire stock and owing to their popularity, sourced further UK market spec models while the model was still produced in RHD.

Midway through model year 2010, the small &quot;GM&quot; badges, used by the corporation company-wide, were dropped.

For the 2012 CTS, the front grille used higher quality materials to give a more vertical design, and the Cadillac logo revised. Power was increased on the 3.6-liter V6, to produce while modified engine internals reduced weight. For 2012, GM also offered some new technology and option packages with the Cadillac CTS.

=== Coupe ===
General Motors unveiled a coupe concept version of the CTS, along with the new CTS-V performance sedan, at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. 

In November 2009, the production version was presented in a press release. The coupe went into production in spring 2010 for sale in August 2010 as a 2011 model. The design of the production model is very similar to the concept, still without a B-pillar. The standard engine was a 3.6L direct injected V6 rated at 304 hp. Like the sedan, both six-speed manual and automatic transmissions, in either RWD or AWD configurations, were available. A CTS-V Coupe was introduced, first shown at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The CTS Coupe was Cadillac&#x27;s first coupe since the Eldorado, which was discontinued in 2002. 

Along with the CTS sedan, the coupe received a light facelift for the 2012 model year, including a new grille design. The CTS Coupe was discontinued after the 2014 model year, while the CTS-V Coupe remained in production for the 2015 model year.


=== Sport Wagon ===

At the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance, Cadillac presented the 2010 CTS Sport Wagon. The wagon became available in late 2009 as a 2010 model. A CTS-V version was added for 2011.

The CTS Sport Wagon is available in either rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive layouts, and is powered by either a 3.0-liter DOHC V6 engine or a 3.6-liter V6 with variable valve timing. The 3.0-liter engine produces , and the 3.6-liter produces .

With the third generation, Cadillac ceased production of the CTS wagon.
=== CTS-V (2009–2014)===
The second generation CTS-V is based on the new GM Sigma II platform. The rear-wheel-drive platform is the basis for the 2008 to present Cadillac CTS base model with which the CTS-V shares most of the body work. The suspension features coil springs front and rear. The front suspension is a control arm arrangement while the rear is an independent multi-link suspension. To improve the handling and comfort, the 2009 CTS-V uses BWI Group&#x27;s MagneRide technology. The dampers, filled with magnetorheological fluid, are adjusted based on sensor readings that happen at 1 ms intervals. The sedan has four-wheel disc brakes similar to the first generation. The front brakes were increased in size to ventilated discs with six piston Brembo fixed calipers. The rear brakes are ventilated rotors with four piston calipers. Steering is speed-sensing hydraulic-assist rack-and-pinion. The steering ratio is 16.1:1. Tire sizes are 255/40ZR19 front and 285/35ZR19 rear on 19×9.0 inch and 19×9.5 inch wheels front and rear.

The 2009 CTS-V was added to the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10 Best Cars list.

The second generation CTS-V sedan, coupe and station wagon was marketed through 2014, concurrent with the third generation standard sedan, until the third generation CTS-V was ready. The car was discontinued and replaced by the CT5–V Blackwing in 2019.

====Engine====
The powerplant in the 2009 CTS-V is a supercharged LSA V-8, based on the LS9 V-8 from the Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1. It produces and of torque. The choice to use a pushrod engine (OHV) arrangement is unique in the luxury performance sedan market where competitors typically use dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines. The engine is produced in GM&#x27;s Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico engine assembly plant. The LSA engine has a bore x stroke of . The engine block is cast aluminium 319-T5 alloy with cast iron cylinder liners. The crankshaft is forged steel using powdered-metal connecting rods. Pistons are high-silicon Hypereutectic Aluminium alloy replacing the forged aluminum used in the LS9 engine. The compression ratio is 9.1:1. The cylinder heads are based on the Corvette&#x27;s LS3 head and are cast from type 356-T6 Aluminum alloy. The exhaust manifolds are cast iron. The supercharger is a twin four-lobe screw compressor-type unit displacing . It is Eaton&#x27;s Twin Vortices Series (TVS) generating a maximum boost of . Intake air is cooled with a water-to-air intercooler built directly into the supercharger unit.

====Transmissions====
There are manual and automatic transmission choices. The manual is a Tremec TR-6060 six-speed transmission with a short-throw shifter, twin disk clutch and dual-mass flywheel. The 6L90 automatic is a paddle shift conventional (planetary gearing and torque converter-based) automatic six-speed.

====CTS-V sedan====
Production of the CTS-V sedan began in the summer of 2008 in the Lansing, Michigan GM plant. Total production of the CTS-V for the 2009 model year was approximately 3,500 out of approximately 59,716 CTS model production. The 2009 CTS-V has a base price of US$59,995, and was available for purchase as of November 1, 2008.

Standard features include: leather seats, lateral acceleration gauge, 19-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires, a built-in 40GB hard drive to store music, and LED flash tracers to tell the driver when to shift.

Options include polished wheels, sunroof, navigation system and, for the first time, Cadillac offers 14-way adjustable performance Recaro seats.

The official 0- time for the second-generation CTS-V is 3.9 seconds, while the quarter mile is run at 12.0 seconds at . These numbers were duplicated by &quot;Road and Track&quot; magazine (0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds for the automatic and 4.1 seconds for the manual).

Coinciding with the release of General Motors&#x27; Viability Plan, the automaker has disbanded its High Performance Vehicle Operations team, the crew responsible for the line V-series Cadillacs, the Chevrolet Cobalt SS, the HHR SS, and the V8 version of the Colorado. According to Vince Muniga, a spokesman for GM, &quot;All high-performance projects are on indefinite hold. The engineers are moving into different areas of the organization, and they will work on Cadillacs, Buicks, Chevrolets and Pontiacs.&quot; Muniga went on to say that there are no plans for high-performance versions of upcoming plans, but once GM is in a better financial position, the team could be reinstated.

For the 2010 model year, GM badges were dropped from near the doors, although earlier models still had the badges.

====CTS-V Coupe====
The CTS-V Coupe debuted at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and entered production in summer 2010 as a 2011 model. It has the same engine and transmission choices as the CTS-V sedan. The CTS-V Coupe features unique centered twin exhausts, a larger grille for air intake, and an optional &quot;saffron&quot; interior trim color. Like the CTS-V sedan, it comes standard with 19-inch aluminum wheels, Brembo brakes, and Magnetic Ride Control.

====CTS-V Sport Wagon====
When asked in 2009 about the possibility of a CTS-V wagon, the GM Vice Chairman at that time, Bob Lutz, replied, &quot;... should sufficient demand materialize, there is no reason why we couldn&#x27;t do a V-Series wagon, and I would be standing in line for one, just ahead of you.&quot; GM decided to move forward, introducing a 5-door sport wagon body style to the CTS-V vehicle line at the New York International Auto Show on March 29, 2010.

The CTS-V wagon shares the engine and 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo brakes, 19 inch aluminum wheels and performance tires and a dual-airflow grille also used in the CTS-V sedan and coupe. The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists the 2014 CTS-V Sport Wagon as the least fuel efficient small station wagon on sale in the United States with a combined EPA fuel economy rating of .

====Performance====
General Motors states a 0- time of 3.9 seconds for the CTS-V Sedan and 4.0 seconds for the CTS-V Coupe and Wagon.

The quarter mile time is reported to be 11.97 seconds at with a 60-foot at 1.76 seconds.

In May 2008, a 2009-model CTS-V sedan achieved a lap time of 7:59.32 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, which was the fastest documented time for a production sedan on factory tires, until the Porsche Panamera Turbo clocked a time of 7:56 in July 2009. The vehicle was driven by John Heinricy during the attempt.
The record breaking vehicle was sold in 2009 at the Barrett-Jackson Palm Beach auction.

== Third generation (2014)==

On March 26, 2013, Cadillac unveiled the third generation of the CTS. The 2014 CTS uses the 2.0L turbocharged I4 and 3.6L V6 from the ATS and also offers an all-new twin turbocharged V6 producing and of torque. The twin turbocharged engine is only available in the CTS Vsport, a new trim that serves as a step between the 3.6L V6 and the high-performance CTS-V.

Despite carrying the CTS name, the third generation model is actually closer in size and market position to the former STS.

===Design===
Bob Boniface and Robin Krieg designed the exterior of the third generation CTS. Eric Clough designed the interior.

===Production===
General Motors began assembling 2014 CTS sedans intended for sale to customers on September 16, 2013. Sales began in October 2013.

===Reception===
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; named the third-generation CTS its 2014 Car of the Year. As customary with award winners, the magazine acquired a CTS (in Vsport trim) for a long-term test. Its verdict lauded the car&#x27;s driving dynamics and reliability but criticized its CUE multi-media interface.

In a four-way comparison in the December 2013 issue of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; the 2014 CTS 3.6 placed second overall. The article praised the handling of the CTS stating &quot;[The CTS] is the only car in this group that didn&#x27;t just put up with hard driving, it indeed goaded its driver to go faster.&quot; and praised the stopping ability, stiff structure and light weight of the car. The article criticized the engine for being &quot;coarse in the upper ranges&quot;, the acceleration times, the fuel economy and the CUE entertainment system.

Sales concerns led Cadillac to offer rebates to the 2014 models and lower sticker prices on the 2015 models.

===Powertrains===
All engines available in the 2014 CTS are constructed from cast aluminum blocks and heads and use direct injection and variable valve timing.

For the 2016 model year, the 6-speed 6L45 automatic transmission was replaced by the new 8-speed 8L45 automatic transmission, with the 8L45 also taking over duties with the naturally aspirated 3.6L V6 from the 8-speed Aisin TL-80SN automatic transmission. V-Sport models will continue to use the 8-speed Aisin TL-80SN. A new 3.6L V6, the LGX, replaced the 3.6L V6 LFX.


=== CTS-V (2016–2019)===

The third generation CTS-V includes a at 6400 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm LT4 supercharged gasoline V8 engine, as the most powerful Cadillac ever produced to date. The third generation CTS-V is sometimes referred to as a four-door Corvette, because of its supercharged V8 from the Corvette C7 Z06 with 10 less horsepower and a top speed of . It weighs . The new 2016 Cadillac CTS-V model equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission has been street tested with a best 0- test time of 3.5 seconds.
The CTS and CTS-V were discontinued after the 2019 model year; a new model, the CT5, built on an Alpha 2 platform, was scheduled to replace the CTS, and would also include a CT5 V series. Production ended in early 2019.

== Awards ==
In its first year of production, the first-generation CTS was nominated for the 2002 North American Car of the Year award. The gen-2 CTS/CTS-V won MotorWeek&#x27;s Driver&#x27;s Choice Awards for &quot;Best Sport Sedan&quot; in 2008 and 2009. The second-generation CTS won the 2008 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award and was chosen as one of &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; 10Best cars.

In 2009, the second-generation CTS and CTS-V were chosen for the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best list, making the CTS the first Cadillac to be chosen twice in consecutive years. In 2010, the second-generation CTS and CTS-V returned to the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best list under the sub-headline &quot;Maybe the best American car ever made&quot;. The CTS-V made the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best list again in 2011 and 2012.

The third-generation CTS won the 2014 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award and was named to the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best list. Also in 2014, the CTS ranked number one among Upscale Midsize Cars according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

== Marketing ==
The success of the CTS has been attributed in part to the car&#x27;s placement in the 2003 sci-fi action film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The producers of the film were seeking a car that would complement the film&#x27;s atmosphere. General Motors suggested the then-unreleased CTS to the filmmakers, who accepted; ten prototypes damaged to different extents were used to represent the film&#x27;s hero car, a silver CTS.

== Motorsports ==

The CTS-V is raced in the SCCA World Challenge series. The first generation CTS-V sedan competed from 2004 to 2007, winning the manufacturer&#x27;s championship in 2005 and 2007. Starting in 2011 the second generation V competed as a coupe, winning Cadillac back-to-back manufacturer&#x27;s championships in 2012 and 2013. The 2011 coupe race car is built by Pratt &amp; Miller. For the 2015 season, the CTS-V was replaced by the Cadillac ATS-V.

<text>Georgia Southern University (informally known as Southern or Georgia Southern) is a public research university in the U.S. state of Georgia. The largest campus is in Statesboro, with additional campuses in Savannah (Armstrong Campus) and Hinesville (Liberty Campus). Founded in 1906, Georgia Southern is the fifth-largest institution in the University System of Georgia.

The university offers over 140 different academic majors at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels. The university had an enrollment of approximately 26,000 students in 2023. Georgia Southern is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot; and a &quot;comprehensive&quot; university by the University System of Georgia.

Georgia Southern University&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, known as the &quot;Eagles&quot;, compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

==History==
Georgia Southern University began as First District Agricultural &amp; Mechanical School, a land grant college under federal legislation and support. It opened in 1908 with four faculty members and 15 students.

Founded as a school for teaching modern agricultural production techniques and homemaking skills to rural school children, First District A&amp;M within two decades shifted its emphasis to meet the growing need for teachers within the state. Its name and mission were changed in 1924 to Georgia Normal School, as a training ground for teachers. Five years later in 1929, after development of a four-year curriculum, it was granted full-fledged senior college status by the state, and the school was renamed as South Georgia Teachers College.
Ensuing decades found more name and mission changes: to Georgia Teachers College in 1939 and Georgia Southern College in 1959.

The university finally integrated its student body in 1965, eleven years after the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954). College President Marvin Pittman had been fired in 1941 by Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge for supporting racial integration; he was eventually rehired.

Georgia Southern has continued its program and physical expansion. With the development of graduate programs in numerous fields and associated research, the institution was granted university status in 1990 as Georgia Southern University.

Since then, the university has embarked on a massive upgrade of facilities, adding more than $300 million in new construction. Georgia Southern was named a Doctoral/Research University by Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 2006. The university is recognized in publications including &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; and &quot;Best Graduate Schools&quot;, &quot;Forbes&#x27;&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; and, most recently, by &quot;Kiplinger&quot; for being one of the &quot;Top 100 Best Values among Public Colleges and Universities.&quot; Additionally, Georgia Southern&#x27;s MBA program was named one of the &quot;Best 301&quot; in the country by &quot;The Princeton Review.&quot;
Since 1999, two new colleges have been established: the College of Information Technology in 2001, and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health in 2004. Additional undergraduate and graduate programs were formed, including doctorate degrees in psychology, public health and nursing. In 2011, the university established the Allen E. Paulson College of Engineering and Computing, formerly known as College of Engineering and Information Technology, which combines the previous College of IT with its engineering programs. In addition, at the same time it created the College of Science and Mathematics, previously known as the Allen E. Paulson College of Science and Technology.

Online bachelor&#x27;s degrees are available in nursing, general studies, and information technology. Master&#x27;s programs are offered in kinesiology, instructional technology, accomplished teaching, instructional improvement, higher education administration, reading education, middle grades education, secondary education, special education, and educational leadership. Additionally, the university offers master&#x27;s degrees in business administration, applied economics, accounting, computer science and sport management. Georgia Southern also offers online endorsements in online teaching and learning, K-5 math, and reading.

Since 1999, the university has had its most significant growth in its more than 100-year history. It has grown in enrollment and physical facilities. Under a Campus Master Plan, the university added the new 1,001-bed residence hall Centennial Place. It has completely renovated and significantly expanded the Zach S. Henderson Library. Completed in 2009, the Eugene M. Bishop Alumni Center is a gathering place for alumni and friends of the university. The Center for Wildlife Education and the Botanical Garden have also been expanded. Currently, the university is concluding construction on a new Engineering and Research Building. The building&#x27;s primary focus is aimed at manufacturing engineering.

On January 11, 2017, the Regents of the University System of Georgia announced that the university would merge with Armstrong State University in Savannah as part of the ongoing campus consolidations recommended by the University System of Georgia (USG). Since 2011, in an attempt to improve efficiency and lower costs, the USG has consolidated several colleges and universities within its system, merging some and closing others while altering or transforming curriculums. In January 2018, both Armstrong State and its smaller Liberty Campus, located in Hinesville, formally merged with Georgia Southern.

In October 2019, some students of Georgia Southern University publicly burned books of Cuban-American novelist Jennine Capó Crucet after she gave a talk on campus. The university declared that &quot;book burning does not align with Georgia Southern&#x27;s values&quot; but declined to discipline the students. Campus events were scheduled October 15 and 16 to discuss censorship and free speech in response to the book burning.

Journalist Abby Martin was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at Georgia Southern University&#x27;s eighth annual International Critical Media Literacy Conference at Georgia Coastal Center in Savannah on February 28, 2020. When she received the contract for this engagement from GSU, she noted a paragraph included pursuant to Georgia&#x27;s law prohibiting participation in boycotts of Israel on the part of parties doing business with the State of Georgia passed in 2016. She refused to agree to its stipulations and after she communicated her refusal to GSU, GSU cancelled the engagement. Thereupon, Martin filed suit against GSU and a number of its officials in the Federal District Court for Northern Georgia seeking the voiding of the Georgia statute on grounds of unconstitutional violation of her rights. The event was cancelled.

They also have their own concepts of Zach&#x27;s Brews (located in the Zach Henderson Library), Market Street Deli (located in the IT Building), Sushi with Gusto (located in the Nursing/Chemistry Building), and Oasis Smoothie &amp; Juice Bar (located in the Recreation and Activities Center). Eagle Dining Services also manages concessions for many Georgia Southern Athletics events, vending all across campus, Catering Services and two convenience stores known as Gus Marts (located in the Russell Union and IT Building).

Georgia Southern University is one of the first to implement a biometric iris recognition system to gain entry to the dining halls in lieu of a swipe card. This system was added to the RAC in the fall of 2015.

====Georgia Southern Museum====

For more than two decades, the University Museum has showcased artifacts of the natural and cultural history of the region, as well as offered visiting exhibits from U.S. and international museums. It holds both permanent and traveling educational programs which include interactive and hands-on programs. Permanent collections and exhibits focus on preserving the natural and cultural history of the Coastal Plain.

====Center for Art &amp; Theatre====
The Center for Art &amp; Theatre opened on February 29, 2008. One of its three galleries is the permanent home of the Georgia Artists Collection, a continuously expanding gift of pieces established and curated by Betty Foy Sanders, Bulloch County native and wife of former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders. Other galleries feature scheduled exhibitions of private, student, and faculty works. The center also hosts a 150-seat Black Box Theatre for student performances.

====Performing Arts Center====
The Performing Arts Center is home to touring shows, lecturers, and programs for cultural outreach. The 825-seat theatre features an orchestra pit and shell, a full-sized stage, and technology for lighting, sound, and production.

====Southern Express====
Southern Express is Georgia Southern&#x27;s bus transportation system. In the fall of 2010, adjustments were made and two new routes with a total of eight buses were introduced. The Gold Route runs from the University Store and makes two stops on Forest Drive before proceeding to the RAC and the park-ride lot at Paulson Stadium. The Gold Route Buses then return to the store making the same stops as before. The Blue Route makes one large circle. The Blue route starts at the University Store and makes two stops on Forest Drive and two stops on Lanier Drive before returning to the University Store. The buses change their routes on days of football games to accommodate fans. During the 2009–2010 school year the buses carried almost 1.6 million passengers.

===Armstrong Campus===

Georgia Southern&#x27;s Armstrong Campus is located in Savannah, accessible by Interstate 16 and Interstate 95. Prior to consolidation with Georgia Southern, the Armstrong Campus was founded as Armstrong Junior College in 1935 by Mayor Thomas Gamble to help Savannah&#x27;s youth and the community at large in stimulating the local economy during the height of the Great Depression. Originally housed in the historic Armstrong House downtown, Armstrong moved to its current location in January 1966.

The Armstrong campus is located in a suburban setting near the Savannah Mall, with direct access to downtown Savannah via Abercorn Expressway. The landscaped campus includes subtropical ferns and flowers, southern magnolias, oak trees draped with Spanish moss, and a wide variety of native plants scattered throughout the arboretum-style grounds.

The campus is home to the Georgia Southern&#x27;s Colleges of Education, Health Professions, and Public Health.

Lane Library is the main academic and research library on the Armstrong campus. Its collection comprises more than 200,000 books and printed materials as well as 18,000 audiovisual works. The university recently invested $5 million in a renovation and expansion of the facility.

The Science Center complex is a two-building complex connected by an enclosed glass walkway. It is home to the Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Physics, and Psychology departments. It includes classroom and lecture space, faculty offices, and labs. The facility opened in 2001 as the largest single increase in instructional space on campus since the campus opened.

A , $24 million student union opened in 2010. It was the Armstrong State University&#x27;s first green building, built with rapidly renewable and recycled materials and featuring a high-efficiency chilled water cooling system. The union houses a 300-seat food court, 200-seat movie theatre, ballroom, bookstore, coffeehouse, convenience store, and expansive porches and lounges. Next to the Student Union is the Memorial College Center. Commonly known as the MCC, it houses the Student Affairs and Student Activities offices for the campus.

Armstrong&#x27;s athletic facilities are located in the southeast area of campus. The Student Recreation and Aquatic Center is a athletic facility that includes a fitness center, and two basketball courts. The Alumni Arena is located adjacent to the Rec Center and includes an indoor running track, weight room, coaches offices, classroom space, and a 4,000-seat arena home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams.

Since consolidation with Georgia Southern, the Armstrong Campus has not maintained a separate athletics program, with the future of these athletic facilities uncertain. Near the end of the 2017–2018 academic year, there were talks of renovating the campus&#x27; current athletic facilities to allow for the university&#x27;s tennis and soccer teams to practice and play at the Armstrong Campus, in addition to creating new recreational and general purpose fields. Such a proposal, if approved, could take up to a decade to complete, with the entire project having a low-end cost of forty million dollars to upgrade the campus&#x27;s current athletic facilities, including infrastructure needs as mandated by division standards.
More than 1,400 students live on campus in the four residential communities located in the southwest portion of the campus. Windward Commons, which opened in 2010, is Armstrong&#x27;s suite-style freshmen residential community and is home to nearly 600 students. It features private and semi-private suites, music practice rooms, multipurpose classrooms, lounge/social areas, laundry facilities, courtyards with outdoor sitting space and barbecue areas, and two classrooms. Compass Point, University Terrace, and University Crossings are apartment-style residence halls for upperclassmen and graduate students.

On April 24, 2013, Armstrong completed renovations to the Memorial College Center, opening the Learning Commons. The space was developed as an extension to the campus&#x27;s Lane Library. Features include Mac and PC labs, three multi-touch tables, and group study rooms.

===Liberty Campus===
The Liberty Campus in Hinesville first began operations as a satellite campus of Armstrong State University in 1997, moving to its current facilities in January 2016. It offers select programs to residents of Liberty County and surrounding areas. The Liberty Campus provides special services to Fort Stewart military personnel and their families. A variety of programs are offered or supported, including associate’s degrees in arts and applied sciences, and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in criminal justice, nursing, early childhood education, middle grades education, and liberal studies, with plans to develop consortium programs with Savannah State University in the years post-consolidation.

===Facilities and classification===
Georgia Southern is involved in energy-related issues in a move toward energy independence and self-sufficiency, with a focus on renewable energy and environmental science research. The State of Georgia established and funded an Endowed Chair of Renewable Energy at Georgia Southern, and biofuel facilities in the state are converting Georgia-grown agricultural products into marketable fuel. The research team is identifying renewable sources of energy in south Georgia and design and evaluate products to capture the energy in a usable form for commercial or residential use in the region. The research team is also assisting regional industries in energy consumption analysis, appropriate strategies for conservation of energy, and preservation of our environments. In addition to creating a regional repository of technology that showcases renewable energy application, these activities will help advance the State of Georgia and the region through the benefits of higher education.

Georgia Southern is home to the Institute of Arthropodology and Parasitology. In honor of the founder of the institute, the name was changed in 2013 to the James H. Oliver Jr., Institute for Coastal Plain Science. An integral part of this program is the U.S. National Tick Collection, the largest collection of ticks in the world, with more than one million specimens representing most of the world&#x27;s 850 species.

Georgia Southern is classified as a &quot;R2&quot; research university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

===Herty Advanced Material Development Center===
Georgia Southern University welcomed Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to campus in April 2012 to sign Georgia Senate Bill 396 into law transferring management of the Herty Advanced Materials Development Center to the university. The new legislation, which aligned the university and Herty to create the Georgia Southern University Herty Advanced Materials Development Center, is designed to enhance economic and business development in the state of Georgia. The alignment became effective July 1, 2012. Herty&#x27;s clients are currently focused in the transportation, forest and paper related products, building materials, energy and the environment and bio-products industries.

The Herty Advanced Material Development Center, which is located near the Port of Savannah, is named for the chemist, businessman and academic Charles Herty (1837-1938), who revolutionized the nation&#x27;s naval stores industry through innovations in turpentine and paper making in the early 1900s. Herty devised the first system for manufacturing newsprint from southern pines, giving the South a tremendously successful cash crop. His first experiments on southern pines were conducted in a forest located on the university&#x27;s campus. The university erected a plaque in 1935 noting the site.

==Student organizations==

<doc id="782772" wikidata="Q1537962" url="?curid=782772" title="Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)">
<text>The Gordon Bennett Cup (or ) is the world&#x27;s oldest gas balloon race, and is &quot;regarded as the premier event of world balloon racing&quot; according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Referred to as the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; of aeronautics, the first race started from Paris, France, on September 30, 1906. The event was sponsored by James Gordon Bennett Jr., the millionaire sportsman and owner of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; newspaper. According to the organizers, the aim of the contest &quot;is simple: to fly the furthest distance from the launch site.&quot; The contest ran from 1906 to 1938, interrupted from 1914 to 1919 by World War I and in 1931, but was suspended in 1939 when the hosts, Poland, were invaded at the start of World War II. The event was not resurrected until 1979, when American Tom Heinsheimer, an atmospheric physicist, gained permission from the holders to host the trophy. The competition was not officially reinstated by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) until 1983.

The record time for the winner of the event is held by Germans Wilhelm Eimers and Bernd Landsmann who remained airborne for over 92 hours in the 1995 race, taking off from Switzerland and landing four days later in Latvia. The distance record is held by the Belgian duo of Bob Berben and Benoît Siméons who, in 2005, piloted their balloon from Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States, to Squatec, Quebec, Canada. The most successful pilots are French Vincent Leys who won the trophy nine times between 1997 and 2017 (six times as the main pilot, three times as the co-pilot) and Austrian (won seven times as the main pilot). American teams have won on the most occasions, with twelve victories.

The 2010 competition started in the United Kingdom, with the balloons departing from Bristol on September 25. The race was marred by the loss of the American team during a storm over the Adriatic Sea on October 1. The balloon was missing until December 6, when a fishing vessel found the cabin containing the pilots&#x27; bodies off the coast of Italy. The 2013 event, departing from France and landing in Portugal, was again won by the French in &quot;F-PPGB&quot;.

==Rules==
According to the official rules, the competition is open to all National Aero Clubs (NACs) &quot;who have met their obligations to the FAI&quot;, with each NAC being allowed to enter up to three teams whose pilots are of the same nationality as the NAC. Before this, only two teams from any single NAC were permitted to compete in a single competition. Pilots should have at least 50 hours experience as pilot in command and be authorized for night-time flying. At least one member of each team must be capable of communicating with Air Traffic Control in English.

The team who wins the contest receives the Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett trophy and the team&#x27;s NAC will hold the contest two years later (originally the winning NAC would host the competition the following year). Any NAC winning the cup in three consecutive races will be the final holder of the cup with the subsequent option to offer a new cup.

==Unofficial events==
Resurrected in 1979 by American Tom Heinsheimer, the competition was held without official FAI sanction for four years. Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson secured victory piloting Double Eagle III in 47 hours from California to Colorado. The following year, the winning team of Jerry Tepper and Corky Myers floated from the takeoff point in California. The 1981 race was won again by Abruzzo, with different co-pilot Rocky Aoki, who covered before touching down, while the 1982 race was won by Joe Kittinger and Charles Knapp who piloted Rosie O&#x27;Grady . Heinsheimer attempted to gain the copyright over the name &quot;Gordon Bennett&quot; and run the event without FAI sanction. However the FAI were granted exclusive rights to the name in 1983, and the organization officially reinstated the competition later that year. Heinsheimer went on to arrange further contests in the United States which were still reported in the national press as being the &quot;Gordon Bennett Balloon Race&quot; or similar.

== Incidents ==

The 1908 race in Berlin saw the fall of the balloon Conqueror, flown by A. Holland Forbes and Augustus Post. Conqueror was the largest balloon entered in the race, standing high and with a gas capacity of . Before the race Forbes had attempted to lengthen the balloon&#x27;s appendix to give the team a strategic advantage. Instead the balloon hit a fence just after takeoff, lost two ballast bags, ascended rapidly and ripped open three minutes into the race. The pair slashed off ballast as they fell . Their descent was slowed only as the balloon&#x27;s fabric caught in the netting and formed a rough parachute. They took hold of the ring above them and lifted their feet as the basket smashed through the tiled roof of a house in the Berlin suburb of Friedenau. Both the men and their instruments survived intact. 

The winners of the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, Alan R. Hawley and Augustus Post, set a distance and duration record of in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened to run into them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero&#x27;s welcome upon their safe return.

On September 23, 1923, five competitors were killed when they were struck by lightning while six more were injured in storms. Among the dead were Lieutenants John W. Choptaw and Robert S. Olmsted who were killed when their balloon &quot;US Army S6&quot; crashed in Loosbroek, Netherlands. Sixty years later, in 1983, Americans Maxie Anderson and Don Ida were killed as the gondola detached from their balloon during an attempt to avoid crossing into East German airspace. Anderson and Ida were participating in the &quot;Coupe Charles et Robert&quot; (named for Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers, inventors of the gas balloon) which was run in parallel with the Gordon Bennett Cup. Following their deaths, the &quot;Coupe Charles et Robert&quot; was never run again.

On September 12, 1995, three gas balloons participating in the race entered Belarusian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B attack helicopter of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of the balloons was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two balloons were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.

On September 29, 2010, the 2004 trophy-winning American team of Richard Abruzzo and Carol Rymer Davis went missing in thunderstorms over the Adriatic Sea. On September 30, the USA retrieval crew suggested that the balloon may have ditched in the sea or have been destroyed by lightning. Debris was found on October 1 by search crews but race control determined that it was not from the missing balloon. Despite this, organizers later stated that the final calculated rate of descent of the balloon had been about , and that the team&#x27;s survival was &quot;unlikely&quot;. The search for the missing pair was called off on October 4. The balloon&#x27;s cabin containing the bodies was recovered by an Italian fishing boat on December 6.

<text>William Machin Stairs, (January 21, 1789 – November 28, 1865) was a merchant, a banker, and a statesman. He was born and died in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

William Machin Stairs was the son of John Stairs (1749–1797), a native of Grenada who had emigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States before moving to Halifax. John Stairs became involved in the shipping business but after some financial difficulties the family returned to Philadelphia in 1793. There, both John Stairs and his wife died and their five children, including the eight-year-old William Machin Stairs, returned to Halifax to be raised by a maternal uncle.

In 1810, Stairs opened a small general store on the Halifax waterfront that marked the beginnings of a business dynasty that endured to 1975. In 1856, he helped found the Union Bank of Halifax. A major shareholder, he served on the bank&#x27;s board of directors and as the bank&#x27;s first president.

Stairs was also active in politics, serving as a Member of the Nova Scotia General Assembly from 1841 to 1843, then as mayor of Halifax from 1847 to 1848 and later as a Legislative Councillor. He would become a strong supporter of Joseph Howe in his Anti-Confederation Party movement.

A member of the Glasite Christian church, William Machin Stairs was married to Margaret Wiseman (1793–1850) with whom he had nine children. They are buried together at the Camp Hill Cemetery, in Halifax.

<doc id="782786" wikidata="Q188363" url="?curid=782786" title="Yugoslavia national football team">
<text>The Yugoslavia national football team represented Yugoslavia in international association football.

Although the team mainly represented the pre-war Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the post-war SFR Yugoslavia, various iterations of the state were formally constituted in football, including the:
* Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918–1929)
* Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929–1945)
* Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (1945)
* Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1963)
* Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1963–1992)

It enjoyed success in international competition, reaching the semi-finals at the 1930 and 1962 FIFA World Cups. In 1992, during the Yugoslav wars, the team was suspended from international competition as part of the United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia.

==History==
The first national team was in the kingdom that existed between the two world wars. The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in Zagreb in 1919 under the name &quot;Jugoslavenski nogometni savez&quot; (and admitted into FIFA), and the national team played its first international game at the Summer Olympics in Antwerp in 1920. The opponent was Czechoslovakia, and the historic starting eleven that represented Kingdom of SCS on its debut were: Dragutin Vrđuka, Vjekoslav Župančić, Jaroslav Šifer, Stanko Tavčar, Slavin Cindrić, Rudolf Rupec, Dragutin Vragović, Artur Dubravčić, Emil Perška, Ivan Granec, and Jovan Ružić. They lost by a huge margin 0–7, but nonetheless got their names in the history books.

===1930 World Cup===

In 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became &quot;Fudbalski savez Jugoslavije&quot; and ordered to move its headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade. The national team participated at the 1930 FIFA World Cup, finishing in fourth place. In its first ever World Cup match in Montevideo&#x27;s Parque Central, Yugoslavia managed a famous 2–1 win versus mighty Brazil, with the following starting eleven representing the country: Milovan Jakšić, Branislav Sekulić, Aleksandar Tirnanić, Milutin Ivković, Ivica Bek, Momčilo Đokić, Blagoje Marjanović, Milorad Arsenijević, Đorđe Vujadinović, Dragoslav Mihajlović, and Ljubiša Stefanović. The team was the youngest squad at the inaugural World Cup at an average age of just under 22 years old, and became quite popular among the Uruguayan public, who dubbed them &quot;Los Ichachos&quot;. The national team consisted of players based in Serbian football clubs, while the Zagreb Subassociation forbid players from Croatian clubs, some of whom were regulars in the national team until then, to play in the World Cup due to the relocation of football association&#x27;s headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade.

===Post-World War II period===
The federation and football overall was disrupted by World War II. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted. It was one of the founding members of the UEFA in 1954.

===Silver Medal at 1948 Summer Olympics===
Yugoslavia began their football campaign by defeating Luxembourg 6–1, with five different players scoring the goals. In the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, they would take out Turkey and Great Britain by the same score of 3–1. In the final though, they would lose to Sweden.

===Silver Medal at 1952 Summer Olympics===
Having a team with many players from the 1948 generation, Yugoslavia was a formidable side at the 1952 Summer Olympics and finished as runners-up behind the famous &quot;Golden Team&quot; representing Hungary. Against the USSR, Yugoslavia was 5–1 up with 15 minutes of their first round match to go. The Yugoslavs, understandably, put their feet up. Arthur Ellis, the match referee, recorded what happened next in his book, &quot;The Final Whistle&quot; (London, 1963): &quot;The USSR forced the most honourable draw ever recorded! [Vsevolod] Bobrov, their captain, scored a magnificent hat-trick. After the USSR had reduced the lead to 5–2, he, almost single-handed, took the score to 5–5, scoring his third in the last minute. For once, use of the word sensational was justified.&quot; Although Bobrov&#x27;s early goal in their replay presaged a miraculous recovery, Yugoslavia recovered sufficiently to put out their opponents easily in the second half.

===Later decades===

In 1976, Yugoslavia organized the European Championship played in Belgrade and Zagreb. The national team participated in eight World Cups and four Euros, won the Olympic football tournament in 1960 at the Summer Games (they also finished second three times and third once), and developed a reputation for skillful and attacking football, leading them to be dubbed &quot;the Brazilians of Europe&quot;.

Dragan Džajić holds the record for the most national team caps at 85, between 1964 and 1979. The best scorer is Stjepan Bobek with 38 goals, between 1946 and 1956.

===Dissolution and UN embargo===
With the end of the Cold War, democratic principles were introduced to the country which brought about the end of Titoist rule. In the subsequent atmosphere, national tensions were heightened. At the Yugoslavia-Netherlands friendly in preparation for the 1990 World Cup, the Croatian crowd in Zagreb jeered the Yugoslav team and anthem and waved Dutch flags (owing to its resemblance to the Croatian tricolour). With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the team split up and the remaining team of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was banned from competing at Euro 92. The decision was made on 31 May 1992, just 10 days before the competition commenced. They had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to United Nations Security Council Resolution 757. Their place was taken by Denmark, who went on to win the competition.

After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the FRY consisted of Montenegro and Serbia.

In 1992, Yugoslavia had also been drawn as the second seed in Group 5 of the European Zone in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup. FRY was barred from competing, rendering the group unusually weak.

In 1994, when the boycott was lifted, the union of Serbia and Montenegro competed under the name &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;, as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia national football team. The Serbia and Montenegro national team continued under Yugoslavia&#x27;s naming until 2003 when the country and team were renamed Serbia and Montenegro.

The Serbia national football team inherited Yugoslavia&#x27;s spot within FIFA and UEFA and is considered by both organizations as the only successor of Yugoslavia (and of Serbia and Montenegro).

==Youth teams==
The under-21 team won the inaugural UEFA U-21 Championship in 1978.

The Yugoslav under-20 team won the FIFA World Youth Championship 1987.

<text>The Caloosahatchee River is a river on the southwest Gulf Coast of Florida in the United States, approximately long. It drains rural areas on the northern edge of the Everglades, east of Fort Myers. An important link in the Okeechobee Waterway, a manmade inland waterway system of southern Florida, the river forms a tidal estuary along most of its course and has become the subject of efforts to restore and preserve the Everglades.

== Description ==
The river issues from Lake Hicpochee, in southeastern Glades County, approximately west of Clewiston. It flows west-southwest past LaBelle, where it becomes tidal, forming an estuary along its lower . It broadens as it nears the gulf, passing Fort Myers and Cape Coral. It enters the Gulf of Mexico southwest of Fort Myers in San Carlos Bay, protected by Sanibel Island.

The C-43 Caloosahatchee Canal connecting Lake Hicpochee to Lake Okeechobee allows continuous navigation from the Caloosahatchee to the Okeechobee Waterway system; oxbow lakes mark isolated stretches of the original waterway. In 2013, heavy rains in southern Florida resulted in high runoff into Lake Okeechobee; rising lake levels forced the United States Army Corps of Engineers to release large volumes of polluted water from the lake through the St. Lucie River estuary to the east and the Caloosahatchee River estuary to the west. Thus, the normal mix of fresh and salt water in those estuaries was replaced by a flood of polluted fresh water resulting in ecological damage.

Until late in the 19th century, the Caloosahatchee River was fed by a series of lakes starting from Lake Hicpochee, and including Lettuce Lake, Bonnet Lake and Flirt Lake. A waterfall and set of rapids at the lower end of Flirt Lake marked the beginning of the river. The rapids were close to long, with a drop in elevation of about . Lake Hicpochee, about in area, was only from Lake Okeechobee, but there was no connection between the two lakes before the late 19th century. Water flowed from Lake Hicpochee westward into Lettuce Lake and then Bonnet Lake. When the water was high, the two lakes merged. From Bonnet Lake, water flowed into Lake Flirt, which was about in area and long. All of the lakes were surrounded by extensive wetlands.

In 1881, Hamilton Disston, as part of a scheme to drain large areas of wetlands in the interior of Florida, had a canal dredged from Lake Okeechobee to Lake Hicpochee and through the lakes and wetlands to the west. His company removed the rock ledge that formed the falls and rapids below Lake Flirt and straightened the upper reaches of the Caloosahatchee River. Various state and federal projects have widened and deepened the river since then. The conversion of the Caloosahatchee River into a canal drained Lake Flirt and the wetlands descending from Lake Hicpochee.

Since the late 19th century, dredging and channelization of the river, as well as the artificial connection to Lake Okeechobee and its use as a water supply for urban and agricultural uses, have substantially altered the hydrology of the river. As a result, both the magnitude and timing of water delivery to the estuary have been substantially altered. Recent programs by the state government have attempted to establish minimum flow levels in the river, in part to help restore the water supply to the Everglades. A federal wildlife refuge for manatees has been established at the mouth of the river on San Carlos Bay near Fort Myers.

<doc id="782790" wikidata="Q3013136" url="?curid=782790" title="Dan Lyle">
<text>Daniel Joseph Lyle (born September 28, 1970) is an American former rugby union player who played for the United States national rugby union team 45 times from 1994 to 2003, serving as U.S. captain in 24 of those matches. Lyle played number eight.

==Early life==
Lyle was born in Louisville, Kentucky. A 1992 graduate of Virginia Military Institute where he played college football, he took up rugby union at age 23 in an attempt to keep fit.

==National team==
Lyle debuted for the U.S. national team against Ireland in November 1994 at Lansdowne Road. He first captained the U.S. squad in a match against Japan in June 1996, in the Pacific Rim tournament. He also led the U.S. sevens team to victory in the bowl competition at the Hong Kong Sevens in 1997. Lyle captained the team at the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Lyle appeared for the United States in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and retired from international play in 2003. Through his national team career, Lyle earned 45 caps for his country, and captained his side in 24 matches, including 11 wins in those matches (at the time a record for the most wins all-time by any U.S. captain; that record has since been broken by Todd Clever).

He joined English club Bath from the Old Mission Beach Athletic Club (OMBAC) for the 1996/7 season. He spent seven seasons at Bath and played in 125 matches for the club. He helped them to lift the Heineken Cup title in 1998 with victory over Brive, and captained the side for the 2001/2 season. Lyle moved to the Leicester Tigers in 2003.

He had been invited to train with the NFL&#x27;s American football team Minnesota Vikings and had a trial with the Washington Redskins.

Lyle was inducted into the US Rugby Hall of Fame on June 4, 2016, in Philadelphia, PA.

==Management==
Dan Lyle worked for United World Sports as an Executive Vice President and Tournament Director with USA Sevens LLC from 2006 to 2016, the owner and operator of the USA Sevens rugby tournament.

<text>Enchanted April is a 1991 British historical drama film directed by Mike Newell. The screenplay by Peter Barnes was adapted from Elizabeth von Arnim&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;The Enchanted April&quot;. It stars Miranda Richardson, Josie Lawrence, Polly Walker, and Joan Plowright, with Alfred Molina, Michael Kitchen, and Jim Broadbent in supporting roles.

==Plot==
Following World War I, Rose Arbuthnot and Lottie Wilkins, unacquainted, belong to the same ladies&#x27; club. Lottie sees Rose sigh wistfully after reading a newspaper advertisement to &quot;those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine&quot; for rental of a small Italian castle. Impulsively, Lottie approaches Rose, suggesting they share a month&#x27;s expenses as a break from domestic tedium. Initially wary, Rose begins to fancy the idea of a vacation from her unhappy marriage. Advertising for two reputable ladies to share expenses, they find the elegant but peevish elderly Mrs. Fisher and the beautiful, aloof, and very wealthy Lady Caroline Dester.

Rose&#x27;s husband, Frederick, authors erotic novels under a pseudonym, and they have grown distant due to her disapproval of his erotica. Rose is unaware he moves in a literary circle frequenting the salon of Lady Dester, mother of Lady Caroline. Frederick is careful to keep his extramarital escapades discreet; thus Rose is unaware he has designs on Caroline.

Fed up with &quot;grabbers&quot; latching onto her for her celebrated beauty and wealth, Caroline seeks a month&#x27;s refuge at San Salvatore. Tired of always being the centre of attention, she initially secludes herself from the other renters, spending her time alone, relaxing in the lush landscape.

Lottie&#x27;s bored frugal husband, Mellersh, concentrates on business and networking. He tracks her expenses to the penny, but neglects her. Inconveniently, Mellersh suggests they take a holiday. Uncharacteristically asserting herself, Lottie replies she has been invited on holiday by an acquaintance and will go there instead. She does not disclose she is paying her expenses with money saved from her household allowance.

Mrs. Fisher, a widow rigid in her ways, immerses herself in memories, rereading works of now dead illustrious personalities she has met during her lifetime in an exalted circle. Initially, at San Salvatore, finding the other three women a disturbance, she insists on staking out the main drawing room for her exclusive use.

During the holiday, Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher at first clash over dominance and expenses. With tact, the meek Lottie becomes the peacemaker, nonconfrontationally exerting subtle influence over the others. With fresh insight, Lottie observes the attitudes among themselves that have contributed to their life discontentment. Lottie decides to invite Mellersh to San Salvatore and encourages Rose to invite Frederick to repair their marriages. Lottie&#x27;s disclosure of the presence of Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline, two wealthy prospective clients, brings Mellersh eagerly to the refuge.

Thrilled at his wife&#x27;s intimate friendship with rich prospects, Mellersh exerts himself to be agreeable, mitigating the problem over the first week&#x27;s expenses. Mellersh declares privately to Lottie that he will pay her expenses so she can keep her savings. He reevaluates his wife and begins to see her as a real social asset.

Tracking the elusive Caroline to San Salvatore in amorous pursuit, Frederick arrives unaware of Rose&#x27;s presence or her invitation to him at Lottie&#x27;s urging. Caroline, who knows Frederick by his pseudonym, does not know he is Rose&#x27;s husband. Caught off-guard when an unexpected Rose greets him warmly with a kiss, Frederick &quot;introduces&quot; himself to Caroline as &quot;Frederick Arbuthnot, Rose&#x27;s HUSBAND.&quot; Tactfully, Caroline does not reveal their prior acquaintance.

San Salvatore&#x27;s owner, George Briggs, pays an unexpected call on his tenants. Attracted to Rose, who he had mistaken for a war widow, he is disappointed to find her living husband. Used to always being the centre of attention, Caroline is astonished to see George—extremely nearsighted due to a war injury—is clearly more drawn to Rose. Frederick, too, begins to see Rose with new appreciation.

Conversely, Caroline is drawn to George because he does not fawn over her. His nearsightedness means he judges women by their qualities, not their looks. Perceiving George&#x27;s distress, during a walk, Caroline elicits his confidence in admitting his disappointment in Rose&#x27;s marriage. In turn, Caroline confides lingering unhappiness at the loss of her fiancé in the war. When the nearsighted George trips over a tree root, Caroline reaches out to steady him, declaring &quot;I had to grab you!&quot;

Mrs. Fisher now values connection with other people. She and Lottie discuss how the group has organically paired off. Lottie assures her there can be many combinations of &quot;pairs&quot;. She and Mrs. Fisher will be a pair, forming an enduring friendship.

==Cast==
* Josie Lawrence as Lottie Wilkins
* Miranda Richardson as Rose Arbuthnot
* Polly Walker as Caroline Dester
* Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fisher
* Alfred Molina as Mellersh Wilkins

==Production==
The film was shot on location at Castello Brown in Portofino, Italy, the castle where the author of the book had stayed in the 1920s. The score by Richard Rodney Bennett, featuring flute and oboe themes, evokes the film&#x27;s mood and accentuates the story&#x27;s yearning and nostalgia.

==Reception==
The film premiered as the opening night gala of the London Film Festival on 6 November 1991. It gained a positive reaction from critics and holds an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Mike Newell&#x27;s adaptation of Elizabeth von Arnim&#x27;s novel moves at a more generous pace than the 1935 version, allowing excellent performances from Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright to flourish.&quot;

<doc id="782795" wikidata="Q17092718" url="?curid=782795" title="Iso-elastic">
<text>In engineering, iso-elastic refers to a system of elastic and tensile parts (springs and pulleys) which are arranged in a configuration which isolates physical motion at one end in order to minimize or prevent similar motion from occurring at the other end.
This type of device must be able to maintain angular direction and load-bearing over a large range of motion.

The most prominent use of an iso-elastic system is in the supporting armature of a Steadicam, used to isolate a film or video camera from the operator&#x27;s movements. 
Steadicam arms all work in a fashion similar to a spring lamp since each arm has two sections (similar to and labelled like a human arm); both the upper and fore-arm sections consist of a parallelogram with a diagonal iso-elastic cable-pulley-spring system. The iso-elastic system is tensioned to counteract the weight of the camera and steadicam sled. This tensioning allows the camera and operator to move vertically and independently of each other. For example, as the operator runs, the bouncing of his body is absorbed by the springs, keeping the camera steady. The arm also has unsprung hinges at both ends of each arm allowing it to bend in the horizontal plane (just like your elbow, not like a spring lamp).

To understand how an iso-elastic system works, we must first understand how springs work. The tension (elastic force) in a spring is proportional to its extension according to Hooke&#x27;s law. This means that if a weight is hung on a spring it will oscillate with simple harmonic motion about its balance point; when the weight is above the balance point the spring&#x27;s tension is reduced so the weight falls due to gravity, and when the weight is below the balance point the spring&#x27;s tension will pull it back upwards.

If a simple spring system were used in a steadicam, then as the operator moved vertically, the camera would be subject to simple harmonic motion, and bounce up and down. To counteract this tendency, an iso-elastic system is employed.

The springs used are large, stiff springs with a high modulus of elasticity, and they are highly tensioned. A compound pulley system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided by a factor of five, for example, so the cable exiting the pulley system will have only moderate tension. Most importantly, however, when the cable is drawn in or out the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much. The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.

The almost constant force exerted by an iso-elastic system is employed in the armature of a steadicam, to counteract the constant force of gravity on the camera&#x27;s and mount&#x27;s mass. The result is that the weight of the camera is almost exactly balanced by the tension force throughout the entire range of vertical movement, so even when the operator jumps vertically, the camera will retain its vertical position due to inertia, but remain balanced, just with the armature at a different angle.

As a result, the camera doesn&#x27;t bounce up to the &#x27;balanced&#x27; position after a move, for example when the operator steps up onto a curb from the road. This allows the camera to be more isolated and independent of the operator&#x27;s moves. The operator can of course deliberately move the camera up or down, if desired. In reality however camera operators find it preferable for the arm to not be perfectly iso-elastic so that the camera will naturally rise to a comfortable operating height; the springs will be tensioned so this only happens very slowly and without bouncing so as to maintain the smoothness of the camera&#x27;s motion.&quot;

<doc id="782796" wikidata="Q5452163" url="?curid=782796" title="Firoz Kassam">
<text>Firoz Kassam (born 1955) is a British businessman. Born and brought up in Tanzania, of Indian descent, he came to Britain at the age of 19. He owned Oxford United F.C. from 1999 to 2006, and was named the 309th wealthiest person in the UK in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2009&quot; with an estimated fortune of £180 million.

==Early life==
Firoz Kassam was born in Tanzania, one of five children. His father had a small confectionery business, and his mother died when he was a child. They migrated to England when he was 19.

==Career==
Starting out with a fish and chip shop, Kassam made his fortune as a slum hotelier and in the 1980s was labelled a &quot;merchant of misery&quot;. He bought run-down London hostels and hotels and was paid by local councils to fill them with homeless people and asylum seekers, until the tenants rebelled over the conditions in which they were being housed.

In 1999, Kassam bought Oxford United F.C. for £1, also taking over its debts, estimated to be in the region of £13m. In 2000, he resumed building a 12,500-capacity stadium at Minchery Farm on the edge of Oxford, which he called the Kassam Stadium. Construction of this stadium had actually been in progress since 1997, but was suspended in the early stages due to the club&#x27;s financial problems. The fourth side of the stadium was left empty due to Oxford&#x27;s decline in the league, as they had dropped down two divisions while the stadium was being built. The development includes a hotel, cinema, bowling alley, gym, health centre and restaurants. Oxford United played its first game there on 18 August 2001, in Division Three of the Football League. Kassam sold the football club in 2006, but retained ownership of the stadium through his company Firoka with Oxford United (and later also London Welsh RFC) as tenants. Oxford United&#x27;s old home, the Manor Ground in Headington, was sold by Kassam, first to his own holding company for £6 million, and then to developers for £12 million in 1999. The ground has since been demolished and developed into the Manor Hospital, which opened in October 2004.

Kassam also owns the historic mansion and grounds of Heythrop Park which he purchased in 1999 for £15m. The site underwent a £50 million rebuilding programme and has been developed into a luxury hotel and spa with an 18-hole championship golf course and restored landscape gardens. In August 2005, he purchased Studley Castle in Warwickshire, a hotel and conference centre formerly owned by Phoenix Venture Holdings, the consortium who owned carmaker MG Rover from 2000 until 2005.

In February 2006, Kassam&#x27;s Firoka company was announced as the preferred bidder for the redevelopment of Alexandra Palace in London. The whole Palace would be given to Firoka on a 125-year lease for commercial uses. As it is held on a charitable trust, and Firoka is a private company, this proposal was very controversial. It was subject to agreement of the charity commission, which received 350 objections to the lease to develop a multi-use exhibition, leisure and entertainment complex. On 5 October 2007 in the High Court, Mr Justice Sullivan granted an application by a member of the conservationist Save Ally Pally group to quash the Charity Commission&#x27;s Order authorizing the lease.

==Net worth==
In 2007, his net worth was estimated at £240 million. In the 2017 Sunday Times Rich List, his net worth was £315 million.

<text>May Irwin (born Georgina May Campbell; June 27, 1862 – October 22, 1938) was an actress, singer and star of vaudeville. Originally from Canada, she and her sister Flo Irwin found theater work after their father died. She was known for her performances as a coon shouter and for her recordings.

==Early life and career==
Born on June 27, 1862, in Whitby, Canada West, as Georgina May Campbell, her father, Robert E. Campbell, died when she was 13 years old; her stage-minded mother, Sophoria Jane Draper, in need of money, encouraged May and her older sister Adeline Flora (&quot;Flo&quot; or &quot;Addie&quot;) to perform. They created a singing act, billed as the &quot;Irwin Sisters,&quot; that debuted at the Adelphi Theatre in nearby Buffalo, New York in December 1874. By late 1877, their careers had progressed and they were booked to appear at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Theater, then at the Tony Pastor Theatre, a popular New York City music hall.

The sisters proved popular enough to earn regular spots for the ensuing six years, after which 21-year-old May set out on her own. She joined Augustin Daly&#x27;s stock company from 1883 to 1887, where she made her first appearance on the theatrical stage. This comedian was known for her improvisation skills. An immediate success, she went on to make her London stage debut at Toole&#x27;s Theatre in August 1884. By the age of 25, she was earning $2,500 a week. In 1886, her husband of eight years, Frederick W. Keller, died unexpectedly. Her sister Flora married New York State Senator Thomas F. Grady.

By the early 1890s, Irwin had married a second time and developed her career into that of a leading vaudeville performer with an act known at the time as &quot;Coon Shouting&quot;, in which she performed African American-influenced songs. In the 1895 Broadway show &quot;The Widow Jones&quot;, she introduced &quot;The Bully Song&quot;, which became her signature number. The performance also featured a lingering kiss, which was seen by Thomas Edison, who hired Irwin and her co-star John C. Rice to repeat the scene on film. In 1896, Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope production, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, became the first screen kiss in cinematic history.

Her own pieces included &quot; The Widow Jones&quot;, &quot; The Swell Miss Fitzswell&quot;, &quot;Courted Into Court&quot;, &quot;Kate Kip-Buyer&quot;, and &quot;Sister Mary&quot;.
In addition to her performing and singing, Irwin also wrote the lyrics to several songs, including &quot;Hot Tamale Alley&quot;, with music written by George M. Cohan. In 1907 she married her manager, Kurt Eisfeldt, and began making records for Berliner/Victor. Several of these recordings survive and give a notion of the actress&#x27;s appeal.

Irwin&#x27;s buxom figure was much in vogue at the time and, combined with her charming personality, made her one of America&#x27;s most beloved performers for more than thirty years. In 1914, she made her second silent film appearance, this time in the feature-length adaptation of George V. Hobart&#x27;s play, &quot;Mrs. Black is Back&quot;, produced by Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Famous Players Film Company and filmed for the most part at her own sprawling home in New York. Still pictures showing May survive from this movie.

A highly paid performer, Irwin was a shrewd investor and became a very wealthy woman. She spent a great deal of time at a summer home on secluded Club Island, a small island off of Grindstone Island of the Thousand Islands, and at her winter home on Merritt Island, Florida, before retiring to a farm near Clayton, New York, where a street would eventually be named in her honor.

Irwin retired in 1925.

==Personal life==
May Irwin was married twice. Her first marriage was to Frederick W. Keller, of St. Louis, from 1878 until his death in 1886. From 1907 to the end of her life, she was married to Kurt Eisfeldt. The couple lived at West 44th Street, New York.

Irwin had two sons by her first marriage, Walter Keller (born ca. 1879 - when she was 17) and Harry Keller (b. 1882 - when she was 20).

==Death==
May Irwin died in New York City on October 22, 1938, aged 76. She is interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, NY.

<doc id="782808" wikidata="Q3987945" url="?curid=782808" title="The Lawrence Welk Show">
<text>The Lawrence Welk Show is an American televised musical variety show hosted by big band leader Lawrence Welk. The series aired locally in Los Angeles for four years, from 1951 to 1955, then nationally for another 16 years on ABC from 1955 to 1971, followed by 11 years in first-run syndication from 1971 to 1982. Repeat episodes are broadcast in the United States by PBS stations. These airings incorporate an original program—usually, a color broadcast from 1965 to 1982—in its entirety. In place of the commercials, newer performance and interview clips from the original stars and/or a family member of the performers are included; these clips are occasionally updated.

==Broadcast history==
===KTLA===
On May 11, 1951, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; began as a local program on KTLA in Los Angeles, the flagship station of the Paramount Television Network. The original show was broadcast from the since-demolished Aragon Ballroom at Venice Beach. In 1954, Paramount announced plans to distribute the show nationwide, plans that never materialized due to Paramount&#x27;s feuds with DuMont Television Network that led to the collapse of both.

===ABC===
The show made its national television debut on the American Broadcasting Company on July 2, 1955, and was initially produced at the Hollywood Palladium, moving to stage 5 at the ABC Television Center at Prospect and Talmadge in Hollywood shortly afterwards. The show was filmed there for 23 of its 27 years on national television.

When the show debuted nationwide, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; was billed as the Dodge Dancing Party in 1955 and 1956. From 1956 to 1959, Lawrence Welk was broadcast two nights per week. The second show&#x27;s title was Lawrence Welk Presents Top Tunes and New Talent (1956–58) and then Lawrence Welk&#x27;s Plymouth Show (1958–59). The Plymouth show was the first American television program to air in stereophonic sound. Because stereophonic television had not yet been invented (it would be 25 more years before it would become standard), ABC simulcast the show on its radio network, with the TV side airing one audio channel and the radio side airing the other; viewers would tune in both the TV and the radio to achieve the stereophonic effect. Starting with the 1959–60 season the two shows were merged into &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, reverting to monophonic broadcasts. During this early period, Chrysler also provided the show&#x27;s announcers: Lou Crosby represented the Dodge shows, while James Narz represented Plymouth. (When it became known that Chrysler&#x27;s rival Ford employed Narz&#x27;s older brother Jack, they changed James&#x27;s name to Tom Kennedy to avoid confusion between the two; Kennedy was moved to &quot;Date with the Angels&quot; in 1957. Bob Warren handled announcing duties.

By 1956, Welk also collaborated with Ben Selvin at RCA Thesaurus to release electrical transcriptions of &quot;The New Lawrence Welk Show&quot; for broadcast on local radio stations which were affiliated with leading national radio networks.

The 1965–66 season was taped at the Hollywood Palace as it was, at the time, ABC&#x27;s only West Coast TV studio equipped for color production; Welk had insisted on transitioning the show to color in 1965, convinced that broadcasting in color was essential to maintaining the program&#x27;s success. The first color episode of the show, which aired in September 1965, was taped at Welk&#x27;s resort in Escondido. The show returned to the ABC Television Center in 1966 after some of its studios were converted to color. The show returned to filming at the Hollywood Palace for the 1976–77 season, moved to CBS&#x27;s Television City studios from 1977 to 1979, and then returned to the ABC Television Center in 1979, where it remained for the rest of its run.

The primary sponsor of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; was initially Dodge. In 1960, Geritol took over sponsorship; Sominex, Aqua Velva, Serutan, Universal Appliances, Polident, Ocean Spray and Sinclair Oil were some of the other companies or brands which served as associate sponsors for a short time. (During later years, a number of &quot;Welk&quot; cast members appeared in commercials for many of the show&#x27;s sponsors, filmed specifically to air during &quot;Welk&quot; broadcasts.) 

&quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; was canceled by ABC in 1971 amidst the rural purge and implementation of the Prime Time Access Rule. 

===Move to syndication and public television===
In response to the show&#x27;s cancellation, Welk started his own production company and continued producing the show for syndication. Some independent stations put it in its old Saturday timeslot, and in many cases, it drew higher ratings than the network shows scheduled at that time. In many markets, the syndicated Lawrence Welk Show aired before the start of network prime-time on Saturday nights (7 p.m. Eastern Time), often competing against another show that was canceled during the rural purge and resurrected in syndication, also in 1971—&quot;Hee Haw&quot;. The success of &quot;Lawrence Welk&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot; in syndication, and the network decisions that led to their respective cancellations, were the inspiration for a novelty song called &quot;The Lawrence Welk-Hee Haw Counter-Revolution Polka&quot;, performed by Roy Clark, one of the co-stars of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. These programs were among a group of syndicated niche programs, including &quot;Soul Train&quot;, that flourished during this era. 

Lawrence Welk retired and production of the weekly television program ended in 1982. At the time of his retirement, Welk was 79 years old, matching &quot;The Gay Nineties Revue&quot; host Joe Howard to become the oldest host of a regularly scheduled US entertainment television series (a feat later surpassed by Bob Barker in 2003 and later by Betty White in 2012). Reruns—largely episodes first aired from 1967 to 1982—were repackaged with new footage (either Welk or the show&#x27;s cast introducing segments) for syndication as &quot;Memories with Lawrence Welk&quot;. In 1985, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Christmas Reunion&quot; was produced. It was the last show in which Welk appeared with the Musical Family.

In March 1987, the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority produced and released a documentary film, &quot;Lawrence Welk: Television&#x27;s Music Man&quot;, hosted by Kathy Lennon of The Lennon Sisters. The film was a retrospective on Welk&#x27;s life and career, featuring interviews with surviving members of Welk&#x27;s Musical Family, and scenes from the show; it was part of a new approach to pledge drive programming that aimed to lure donors with popular music and nostalgia, an approach that later became standard at other public television stations. The film was so successful that the OETA acquired rerun rights to the program and began offering them to stations nationwide that October. Welk&#x27;s segments from &quot;Memories with Lawrence Welk&quot; were used until his death, after which members of the Musical Family took over as hosts. Reruns, with updated interviews from cast members, continue to air to this day (in many markets airing on Saturday nights at 7 pm, the same time the show aired during the latter years of its original run). The shows are occasionally &quot;recut&quot; and interspersed with segments from other episodes.

Most episodes rerun on PBS stations originally aired between 1965 to 1982, the majority being from the syndicated run.

===Nielsen ratings===
The show was most highly rated during the mid to late 1960&#x27;s and was a top 30 hit for five seasons, according to ClassicTVHits.com&#x27;s ratings database.
*1964–65: No. 30 (22.00 rating)
*1965–66: No. 19 (22.40 rating)
*1966–67: No. 12 (22.79 rating)
*1967–68: No. 17 (21.90 rating)
*1968–69: No. 29 (20.50 rating)

==Format==
The show would often open by showing bubbles floating around and was accompanied by a sound effect of a bottle of champagne opening, including the opening theme (originally &quot;Bubbles in the Wine&quot;, composed by Welk and Frank Loesser, later replaced with a derivative theme, &quot;Champagne Time&quot;, and fanfare composed by George Cates). Welk frequently demonstrated on camera how the champagne bottle sound was created. He would place a finger in his mouth, release it to produce a popping sound, and then make a soft hissing noise to mimic bubbles escaping the bottle. One such demonstration is included in the opening sequence of the public television reruns.

Each week, Welk would present the show&#x27;s theme, which was followed by either an orchestral performance or a group number featuring the entire cast of singers from the Musical Family. Welk introduced most of the acts throughout the episode, delivering his monologues in a distinctive German accent. The accent became a hallmark of his persona and was frequently parodied in popular culture, including by Welk himself (two books he authored, his autobiography &quot;Wunnerful, Wunnerful!&quot; and &quot;Ah-One, Ah-Two!&quot; were so titled because they were his catchphrases). Welk&#x27;s accent sometimes led to notable mispronunciations of scripted lines from cue cards. In &quot;Wunnerful, Wunnerful!&quot;, Welk bemoaned his accent, and in some of his pronunciations of &quot;wonderful&quot; in the show he can be heard forcing the D.

For certain songs, particularly instrumentals performed by the orchestra, couples in the audience were invited to dance in the studio. Welk himself often joined in, dancing with members of the audience. Many of the show&#x27;s songs were performed as part of a skit, especially during the show&#x27;s later years.

The Musical Family performed a wide range of music, including adult standards and big band numbers, as well as renditions of pop, country, Christian, and patriotic songs. Welk had a particular admiration for composers contemporary with him, such as Hoagy Carmichael, Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer, Cole Porter, and Harry Warren. Welk stated in 1956 that his Musical Family could perform any song &quot;as long as it&#x27;s done in the champagne style&quot;. 

In one of the show&#x27;s most infamous incidents, singers Gail Farrell and Dick Dale performed &quot;One Toke Over the Line&quot; (a mock gospel song riddled with drug references) as a modern spiritual in a 1971 episode, apparently oblivious to the meaning of the word &quot;.&quot; Songwriter Mike Brewer responded that although it was &quot;absurd&quot;, his Brewer &amp; Shipley duo &quot;got more publicity than we could pay for&quot; from the out-of-place performance. Welk blamed ABC for pressuring him into including the song, among others he felt did not fit the show&#x27;s format.

Nearly all the music on the show was performed in-house by the Musical Family, with guest appearances being a rarity. Notable exceptions included performances by artists such as Henry Mancini, Eddie Peabody, The Chantays, Stan Boreson, Charley Pride, Jack Benny, and Barbara Mandrell.

The closing theme during the syndicated years, with lyrics often performed by the &quot;Musical Family&quot;, was &quot;Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen&quot; (composed by George Cates). A recording of the song has been edited over the updated credits on PBS reruns.

===The Musical Family===
Welk&#x27;s performers were known as his Musical Family. Most members of the Musical Family had specific, well-defined roles within the context of the show, generally specializing in one type of performance. One of the most prominent positions in the Musical Family was the &quot;Champagne Lady&quot;, who always sang a down-tempo solo number in every episode. Norma Zimmer was the longest running Champagne Lady, appearing on the show from 1960 to 1982.

The Musical Family followed an unofficial code of conservative artistic and personal morals set by Welk. Welk closely monitored fan letters to gauge performers&#x27; popularity, giving more prominent roles to those who received positive feedback. Performers who failed to resonate with the audience often saw their solo opportunities decrease and were sometimes ultimately fired. In 1959, Welk fired Champagne Lady Alice Lon, prompting thousands of viewers to write to Welk demanding an apology and her reinstatement. Although Welk attempted to rehire her, Lon declined.

Welk&#x27;s conservative artistic standards put him at odds with clarinetist Pete Fountain, who reportedly left the show after Welk took issue with his attempt to perform a jazz version &quot;Silver Bells&quot; during the show&#x27;s 1958 Christmas special. In an interview, Fountain stated he left The Lawrence Welk Show because &quot;Champagne and bourbon don&#x27;t mix.&quot; 

Among the performers that were popular with audiences during the ABC era were The Lennon Sisters, Joe Feeney, Steve Smith, Larry Hooper, Jo Ann Castle and Buddy Merrill. Lynn Anderson, Clay Hart, and Ava Barber used the show as a springboard to launch careers as country music solo artists. At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, members of the Musical Family were featured in several celebrity tabloid magazines alongside other mainstream television and movie stars.

Tap dancer Arthur Duncan became the second African-American to appear regularly on a sponsored television variety program, and the first since 1951, when he was hired as a permanent music maker by Welk in 1964.

==Producers and directors==
James Hobson (also known as Jim Hobson) served longest as producer (1962–1982) and director of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. Hobson died on April 26, 2013, in Santa Monica Hospital, California.

==Episode status==
The surviving episodes from the first 10 seasons on ABC exist today as black and white kinescopes or videotape, as the show was broadcast live through the 1964–1965 season. Beginning with the 1965–1966 season, the episodes were recorded in color. It is assumed the color episodes exist intact. 

===DVD status and Welk specials aired on public television===
Neither the Welk Organization nor the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority have released any episodes of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; on home video, nor are there any plans to do so. Welk Musical Family specials, however, are available on DVD, and can be obtained with a donation during reairs on local PBS stations.

==In popular culture==
===In music===
* Accordion pop/rock band Those Darn Accordions recorded &quot;The Story of Lawrence Welk&quot; on their 1994 album &quot;Squeeze This!&quot;, a comic retelling of Welk&#x27;s life story which references his television series, incorporating musical bits from &quot;Bubbles in the Wine&quot; and name-dropping series regulars Alice Lon, The Lennon Sisters and the show&#x27;s sponsorships from Dodge and Geritol.
* Stan Freberg created a parody of the show in a song called &quot;Wun&#x27;erful Wun&#x27;erful (Sides uh-one and uh-two)&quot;, which became a Top 30 hit in 1957. Originally performed on Freberg&#x27;s CBS Radio series, the single spoofed the musicianship among some of Welk&#x27;s musicians (including Welk himself). The record was arranged by Billy May, who handled the music on Freberg sessions and was known to despise Welk&#x27;s style of music. Working with May and Freberg, who portrayed Welk, were Hollywood studio musicians who held Welk&#x27;s music in equal contempt. Welk was not pleased by the record, built around satirical out-of-tune performances and an out-of-control &quot;bubble machine&quot; that sent the entire Aragon Ballroom out to sea.
* Dickie Goodman also used Welk as a source for inspiration and a target of satire on his 1959 novelty single, &quot;Stagger Lawrence&quot;, which featured an episode of the show being repeatedly interrupted by Lloyd Price&#x27;s version of the blues piece &quot;Stagger Lee.&quot;
* The show is one of two that serve as the main subjects of the 1972 song &quot;The Lawrence Welk-Hee Haw Counter-Revolution Polka,&quot; the other being &quot;Hee Haw&quot; (&quot;Hee Haw&quot; host Roy Clark sang the song). Both programs had been canceled by their respective networks in 1971, only to continue in first-run syndication (and be enormously popular) for several years thereafter.

===In television===
* On October 4, 2008, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodied the show with Fred Armisen portraying Welk. The sketch features the four singing Maharelle sisters (a parody of the Lennon Sisters) &quot;all the way from the Finger Lakes&quot;. The sketch—and Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character Dooneese Maharelle in particular—proved so popular with audiences that the Welk parody became a recurring sketch over the next few seasons.
* In &quot;The Ride&quot;, episode 6.09 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Paulie Walnuts watch a December 1975 episode of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; with his aunt, Marianucci Gualtieri, who refers to it as &quot;The Lawrence Welk&#x27;s Program&quot;. They have very little dialogue and the show is prominently featured in the scene. The music from the show leads into the credits.
* The 1970s sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; used the Welk show as a source of comedic material. One episode involved a scene when Arnold Horshack, upon noticing a kitchen sink overflowing with bubbles, yelled &quot;Help! We&#x27;re being invaded by Lawrence Welk!&quot;
* A September 1961 episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; titled &quot;The Hit Song Writers&quot; featured a sendup of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; in which Daws Butler voiced a Stone-Age Welk.

<text>Baron Greenwich was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom that has been created twice in British history.

== History ==
Prior to the title&#x27;s first creation in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1767, King Charles II of England planned to create the title &quot;Countess of Greenwich&quot; for Nell Gwyn, one of his low-born mistresses. This was to follow Charles II bestowing the titles of Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine, Baroness Limerick, and Baroness Nonsuch upon his other mistress, Barbara Palmer; the title of Viscountess Shannon upon his first mistress, Elizabeth Killigrew; and the titles of Duchess of Portsmouth, Duchess of Aubigny, Countess of Fareham, and Baroness Petersfield to yet another mistress, Louise de Kérouaille.

However, Charles died on 6 February 1685, having never followed through on his original plans to ennoble Gwyn.

The first official creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1767, when Lady Caroline Townshend was made Baroness Greenwich, in the County of Kent, with remainder to the male issue by her second husband, Charles Townshend. She was the daughter of Field Marshal The 2nd Duke of Argyll, who had been created Earl of Greenwich in 1715 and Duke of Greenwich in 1719, titles which became extinct on his death in 1743. As Caroline&#x27;s two sons by her second husband predeceased her, the title became extinct upon her death in 1794.

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1947 when Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, on the morning of his wedding to Princess Elizabeth (who became Queen Elizabeth II), was made Baron Greenwich, of Greenwich in the County of London. He was made Duke of Edinburgh and Earl of Merioneth at the same time. Prince Philip died in 2021, and the title passed to his son Prince Charles, until it merged with the crown when Charles became King in 2022.

<doc id="782822" wikidata="Q1234687" url="?curid=782822" title="William of Newburgh">
<text>William of Newburgh or Newbury (, &quot;Wilhelmus Neubrigensis&quot;, or &quot;Willelmus de Novoburgo&quot;. 1136 – 1198), also known as William Parvus, was a 12th-century English historian and Augustinian canon of Anglo-Saxon descent from Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire.

William experienced the Jewish pogroms in York in the late 12th century mentioning, &quot;the slaughter was less the work of religious zeal than of bold and covetous men who wrought the business of their own greed&quot;. William also composed a lengthy Marian exposition on the Song of Songs and three sermons on liturgical texts and Saint Alban.

==History of English Affairs==

William&#x27;s major work was &quot;Historia rerum Anglicarum&quot; or &quot;Historia de rebus anglicis&quot; (&quot;History of English Affairs&quot;), a history of England from 1066 to 1198, written in Latin. The work is valued by historians for detailing The Anarchy under Stephen of England. It is written in an engaging fashion and still readable to this day, containing many fascinating stories and glimpses into 12th-century life. He is a major source for stories of medieval revenants, animated corpses that returned from their graves, with close parallels to vampire beliefs, and the only source for the bishop-pirate Wimund.

The 19th-century historian Edward Augustus Freeman expressed the now outdated opinion that William was &quot;the father of historical criticism.&quot; Indeed, he was very critical of King John, whom he describes as &quot;nature&#x27;s enemy&quot;, and in general his discussion of English kings is &quot;loyal but critical and cool&quot;.

William saw his own work as being based on reliable sources, unlike Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, of which Newburgh was highly critical, saying &quot;only a person ignorant of ancient history would have any doubt about how shamelessly and impudently he lies in almost everything.&quot; He criticised Geoffrey for writing a history that conflicted with the accounts found in the writings of Bede and the church.

Because belief in souls returning from the dead was common in the 12th century, William&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; briefly recounts stories he heard about revenants, as does the work of Walter Map, his Welsh contemporary. Although they form a minor part in each work, these folklore accounts have attracted attention within occultism. He also described the arrival of green children from &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Land&quot; and other mysterious, wondrous occurrences. While he says that these have an apparent signification, he does not explain what that meaning might be: &quot;he offers these prodigious events to his readers with questions, hesitations, and doubt – with, in short, all the confessions of a critical and honest mind&quot;.

&quot;The latest complete edition of William&#x27;s history is still that found in Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I. Edited by Richard Howlett. Rolls Series no. 82. London, 1884-9. Books 1-4 of William&#x27;s history appear in volume 1, book 5 in volume 2.&quot;

<text>In a tax system, the tax rate is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business or person is taxed. The tax rate that is applied to an individual&#x27;s or corporation&#x27;s income is determined by tax laws of the country and can be influenced by many factors such as income level, type of income, and so on. There are several methods used to present a tax rate: statutory, average, marginal, flat, and effective. These rates can also be presented using different definitions applied to a tax base: inclusive and exclusive.

==Statutory==
A statutory tax rate is the legally imposed rate. An income tax could have multiple statutory rates for different income levels, where a sales tax may have a flat statutory rate.

The statutory tax rate is expressed as a percentage and will always be higher than the effective tax rate.

==Average==
An average tax rate is the ratio of the total amount of taxes paid to the total tax base (taxable income or spending), expressed as a percentage. Average tax rates is used to measure tax burden of individuals and corporations and how taxes affect the individuals and corporations ability to consume.

* Let formula_1 be the total tax liability.
* Let formula_2 be the total tax base.

::formula_3

In a proportional tax, the tax rate is fixed and the average tax rate equals this tax rate. In case of tax brackets, commonly used for progressive taxes, the average tax rate increases as taxable income increases through tax brackets, asymptoting to the top tax rate. For example, consider a system with three tax brackets, 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000, the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000, and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000. Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%). In total, they would pay $4,500, or an 18% average tax rate.

==Flat==

Flat tax rate also known as single-rate is one of the simplest taxations. For flat is a single tax rate (same percentage) on the whole taxable amount. A flat tax rate is used because of its simplicity, transparency, neutrality, and stability. Flat tax rates are quite transparent because it makes it easier for taxpayer to estimate their tax liability and for policymakers to estimate how changes would impact tax revenue. 

One simplified example is a flat tax rate in Colorado. There is a flat tax rate determined at 4.4%. Assuming that an annual taxable income is $100,000, then the income tax is equal to $4,400.

In practice, a flat tax rate on income is used in many states of the USA, like Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah, or internationally, for example in many post-Soviet countries like Hungary, Serbia, Estonia or Ukraine, and also in Iceland or Bolivia. 

On the other hand, it must be said that, in practice, no state has a perfectly flat income tax rate, and every state makes certain distinctions between types of income and has several discounts and reductions.

A poll tax, also known as a head tax, is a flat tax of a set dollar amount per person. As an example, in the history of the USA, a poll tax was introduced in 1870, which was a fee paid for the right to vote.

The marginal tax in these scenarios would be constant (in case of a poll tax—zero), however, these are both forms of regressive taxation and place a higher tax burden on those who are least able to cope with it, and often results in an underfunded government leading to increased deficits.

==Marginal==
A marginal tax rate is the tax rate on income set at a higher rate for incomes above a designated higher bracket, which in 2016 in the United States was $415,050. For annual income that was above the cut-off point in that higher bracket, the marginal tax rate in 2016 was 39.6%. For income below the $415,050 cut off, the lower tax rate was 35% or less.

The marginal tax rate on income can be expressed mathematically as follows:

::formula_4

where &quot;t&quot; is the total tax liability and &quot;i&quot; is total income, and ∆ refers to a numerical change. In accounting practice, the tax numerator in the above equation usually includes taxes at federal, state, provincial, and municipal levels. Marginal tax rates are applied to income in countries with progressive taxation schemes, with incremental increases in income taxed in progressively higher tax brackets, resulting in the tax burden being distributed amongst those who can most easily afford it.

An example of the usage of marginal tax rates and tax brackets used in the USA in 2023 can be seen below. The layout can be seen in the following table.

For an income equal to $58,000 per year then $11,000 of it is taxed by 10%, $33,725 by 12%, and $13,275 by 22%. The marginal tax of this individual is equal to 22%. This is also an example of how progressive taxation works in practice.

Marginal taxes are used by governments to generate revenue.

==Specific==

A specific tax rate, or per unit tax rate, is a fixed amount of tax on a specific good or service. It means that the tax rate is not in the form of percentages but in the form of single units which does not depend on the price of goods but on the amount of units. Specific tax is used in tobacco taxation because it has been proved that a high specific tax significantly enlarges the price of cigarettes and it is an effective way to reduce the consumption of goods like cigarettes.

For example, we can have a pack of cigarettes containing 20 cigarettes in California. The California tax rate is $0.1435 per cigarette stick and $2.87 per pack of 20 cigarettes. So if a pack costs $10 or $12, the tax rate for both is $2.87.

==Mixed tax rate==

For some goods exists a combination of two tax rates. The commonly known mixed tax rate is specific and flat at once. Usually, it is used for excise taxation or sin taxation used on tobacco, alcohol, or fuel.

For example, we can again have a pack of cigarettes containing 20 cigarettes but in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the flat tax rate is at 16.5 % of the retail price and also £ 6.33 per pack of 20. Let’s say that the price of the pack of cigarettes before tax is £10.00. Then specific tax is £ 6.33 and flat tax rate is £10.00 * 16.5% = £1.65. Then a pack of 20 cigarettes costs £17.98 and the tax expense is £7.98.

==Effective==
The effective tax rate is the &quot;percent of their income&quot; that an individual or a corporation pays in taxes.

The term is used in financial reporting to measure the total tax paid as a percentage of the company&#x27;s accounting income, instead of as a percentage of the taxable income. International Accounting Standard 12, define it as income tax expense or benefit for accounting purposes divided by accounting profit. In Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States), the term is used in official guidance only with respect to determining income tax expense for interim (e.g. quarterly) periods by multiplying accounting income by an &quot;estimated annual effective tax rate&quot;, the definition of which rate varies depending on the reporting entity&#x27;s circumstances.

In U.S. income tax law, the term can be used in relation to determining whether a foreign income tax on specific types of income exceeds a certain percentage of U.S. tax that would apply on such income if U.S. tax had been applicable to the income. 

An interesting phenomenon connected with effective tax rate is its negativity called negative effective tax rate, which occurs when the tax benefits received by an individual or corporation exceed the taxable income. A negative tax rate can happen because of factors such as tax credits, deductions, or incentives, for example, if a corporation has a pre-tax income of $100k and tax benefits of $110k, then the corporation has a negative effective tax rate. It also works with individuals and in this system government pays individuals.

==Inclusive and exclusive==
 Tax rates can be presented differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between tax systems confusing.

Some tax systems include the taxes owed in the tax base (tax-inclusive, Before Tax), while other tax systems do not include taxes owed as part of the base (tax-exclusive, After Tax). In the United States, sales taxes are usually quoted exclusively and income taxes are quoted inclusively. The majority of Europe, value added tax (VAT) countries, include the tax amount when quoting merchandise prices, including Goods and Services Tax (GST) countries, such as Australia and New Zealand. However, those countries still define their tax rates on a tax exclusive basis.

For direct rate comparisons between exclusive and inclusive taxes, one rate must be manipulated to look like the other. When a tax system imposes taxes primarily on income, the tax base is a household&#x27;s pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate taxes owed. Under this formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed. If an individual&#x27;s gross income is $100 and income tax rate is 20%, taxes owed equals $20.

The income tax is taken &quot;off the top&quot;, so the individual is left with $80 in after-tax money. Some tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good&#x27;s price. Unlike the income tax example above, these taxes do not include actual taxes owed as part of the base. A good priced at $80 with a 25% exclusive sales tax rate yields $20 in taxes owed. Since the sales tax is added &quot;on the top&quot;, the individual pays $20 of tax on $80 of pre-tax goods for a total cost of $100. In either case, the tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts—$80 of after-tax spending money and $20 of taxes owed. A 25% exclusive tax rate approximates a 20% inclusive tax rate after adjustment. By including taxes owed in the tax base, an exclusive tax rate can be directly compared to an inclusive tax rate.

:Inclusive income tax rate comparison to an exclusive sales tax rate:
* Let formula_2 be the inclusive tax rate (like an income tax). For a 20% rate, then formula_6
* Let formula_7 be the exclusive rate (like a sales tax).
* Let formula_8 be the total price of the good (including the tax).

:The revenue that would go to the government:

::formula_9

:The revenue remaining for the seller of the good:

::formula_10

:To convert the inclusive rate to the exclusive rate, divide the money going to the government by the money the company nets:

::formula_11

:Therefore, to convert any inclusive tax rate to an exclusive tax rate, divide the inclusive rate by 1 minus that rate.
* 15% inclusive = 18% exclusive
* 20% inclusive = 25% exclusive
* 25% inclusive = 33% exclusive
* 33% inclusive = 50% exclusive
* 50% inclusive = 100% exclusive

==Tax deductions and tax credits==

Tax deductions and tax credits are two ways how to decrease taxpayer’s liability. Individuals can claim credits and deductions when they file their tax returns to lower their taxes, which is connected with marginal and average tax rates. 
===Deductions===

A tax deduction is an amount you can subtract from your taxable income, so you do not have to pay tax on it. By lowering individual taxes, taxable income is also lowered, and the average tax rate decreases too. Their value depends highly on the top marginal tax bracket. For example, if we have an individual whose top marginal tax bracket is 10% then the maximum deductions from $2000 is $200. On the other hand, if we have an individual whose top marginal tax rate is 37% then the maximum deduction from $2000 is $740.

===Credits===

A tax credit is an amount that can be subtracted directly from an individual tax bill, which means that credits increase an individual&#x27;s refund or reduce the amount of taxes that an individual owes. Tax credits again lower the average tax rate but tax credits are not influenced by the marginal tax rate. If an individual has $2000 of tax credits then his taxes are directly smaller by $2000. 

==Optimal==

The standard theory of optimal tax rate aims to design the tax to maximize social welfare while collecting a certain level of revenue.

===Laffer curve=== 

One of the theories on how to find optimal tax rates is called the Laffer curve (named after economist Arthur Laffer). Laffer curve is a hump-shaped curve, that compares the relationship between tax rate and tax revenue. The Laffer curve tells us that raising tax rates beyond some level may reduce incentives enough to reduce output and tax revenues. There is, then, a tax rate at which tax revenues are maximized.

Economic historian Thomas Sowell says, &quot;Tax rates and tax revenues can move in opposite directions.&quot;

<text>Diaphanidae is a family of small marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the order Cephalaspidea, commonly known as headshield slugs and bubble snails. This family is characterized by its members’ delicate, often translucent shells and their adaptation to a variety of marine environments.

== Taxonomy and classification ==
The family Diaphanidae falls under the class Gastropoda, subclass Heterobranchia, and order Cephalaspidea. The type genus for this family is Diaphana, which was first described by T. Brown in 1827.

== Morphology ==
Members of the Diaphanidae family typically possess small, fragile shells that are often globular in shape. These shells are sometimes referred to as “paper bubble” shells due to their thin and delicate nature. The body of these gastropods is usually soft and can retract into the shell for protection.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Diaphanidae species are found in a wide range of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to deeper oceanic regions. They have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, meaning they can be found in various parts of the world.

== Notable species ==
Some notable species within the Diaphanidae family include:

* Diaphana abyssalis Schiøtte, 1998
* Diaphana anderssoni (Strebel, 1908)
* Diaphana brazieri (Angas, 1877)
* Diaphana californica (Dall, 1919)
* Diaphana caribaea (Espinosa, Ortea &amp; Fernández-Garcés, 2001)

== Ecological role ==
Diaphanidae gastropods play a significant role in their ecosystems as both prey and grazers. They feed on a variety of small organisms and detritus, contributing to the nutrient cycle within their habitats.

<text>Nicholas James Bollettieri (July 31, 1931 – December 4, 2022) was an American tennis coach. He pioneered the concept of a tennis boarding school, and helped develop many leading tennis players during the past decades, including Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Monica Seles, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, and Maria Sharapova. Bollettieri was also a tour traveling coach, the last time having been for and with Boris Becker for a span of two years.

Bollettieri was mentioned and/or profiled in several television series and documentary films, including Jason Kohn&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Love Means Zero&quot;, which was premiered at the 42nd Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017.

==Education==
Born in Pelham, New York, to immigrant Italian parents, Nick Bollettieri attended Pelham Memorial High School. He was a charter member of the Beta Lambda chapter of the Omega Gamma Delta Fraternity and he graduated in 1949. In 1953, he graduated from Spring Hill College (Mobile, Alabama) with a degree in philosophy. After serving with the United States Army and attaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1956, he turned to teaching tennis after dropping out of the University of Miami Law School. Bollettieri&#x27;s first students included Brian Gottfried. His first formal tennis camp was at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.

==Career==
Though he had only dabbled in the sport in high school, Bollettieri was the tennis director at Dorado Beach Hotel in Puerto Rico in the late 1960s when it was a Rockefeller resort.

Moving to Longboat Key, Florida, in 1978, Bollettieri served as an instructor for the Colony Beach and Tennis Resort. In the early 1980s, Bollettieri opened the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (NBTA) in Bradenton, Florida, on in unincorporated Manatee County on the west coast of Florida, about fifty miles south of Tampa.

Seeing a template for other sports, International Management Group (IMG) bought the academy from Bollettieri in 1987, but Bollettieri continued to manage and play a pivotal role in the development of the tennis academy and ancillary programs. In his final years Bollettieri coached top-tier players at the academy, and spent most of his time in Bradenton.
=== Off-court ===
Bollettieri continued to teach and hold public speaking engagements worldwide, including a visit to teach students at Tri-State Athletic Club in Evansville, Indiana. He was also the instruction editor of &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine. Over the course of his life, Bollettieri wrote two memoirs: &quot;My Aces, My Faults&quot; with Dick Schaap in 1996, and &quot;Bollettieri: Changing the Game&quot; in 2014.

Bollettieri also wrote a 2001 instructional book, &quot;Bollettieri&#x27;s Tennis Handbook&quot;, which covers everything from stroke techniques and strategies to skill development and physical and mental conditioning. Additionally, he was featured in the &quot;Nick Bollettieri DVD Collection&quot;, a set of ten instructional DVDs that cover a wide range of practice methods.

===Grunting controversy===
Bolletieri personally trained the majority of the controversially loud grunters in tennis, leading to repeated accusations that he has been deliberately teaching grunting as a novel tactic in order to give his later generations of students an edge in competitive play.

Bollettieri has denied teaching grunting as a distraction tactic, and says grunting is natural, &quot;I prefer to use the word &#x27;exhaling&#x27;. I think that if you look at other sports, weightlifting or doing squats or a golfer when he executes the shot or a hockey player, the exhaling is a release of energy in a constructive way&quot;. In 2011, after Danish player Caroline Wozniacki (then world no. 1) publicly accused Bollettieri&#x27;s students of cheating by grunting, Women&#x27;s Tennis Association Chairman Stacy Allaster stated that the WTA would be &quot;talking to the Bollettieri academy&quot; about the predominance of loud grunters from that institution and how it could be eliminated from the next generation of players. One year later, a division of Bollettieri&#x27;s academy released a document calling grunting &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; and acknowledging that it obscures the sound of string impact (as noted by Navratilova), resulting in &quot;an increase in an opponent&#x27;s decision error, and a slower response time&quot;.

==Notable students==
The earliest Bollettieri pupils to reach No. 1 were Monica Seles, Jim Courier, and Andre Agassi. Later, Marcelo Ríos climbed to the top while associated with Bollettieri. The Williams sisters had a long-standing relationship with Bollettieri, having visited the academy for years, and they have often prepared for Grand Slams there. Mary Pierce and Anna Kournikova also trained at the academy. More recent students who trained with Bollettieri include Maria Sharapova (who moved from Russia at the age of nine) and Jelena Janković (from Belgrade, Serbia, aged 12); both became no. 1. Max Mirnyi, who trained with Bollettieri for 17 years, was ranked world number 1 in men&#x27;s doubles. Bollettieri&#x27;s most famous coaching roles while travelling as a tour coach were with Andre Agassi from 1986 until Bollettieri ended the arrangement following the 1993 Wimbledon tournament, and with Boris Becker from December 1993 to August 1995. Before becoming a wildlife-related personality, Frank Cuesta had also attended Bollettieri&#x27;s academy, and became a tennis coach himself in Thailand to open one of Bollettieri&#x27;s academies there.

==Personal life==
Bollettieri was married eight times, and had seven children. He was survived by his eighth wife, Cindi Eaton, whom he had married on April 22, 2004. The same year, they founded Camp Kaizen, a nonprofit fitness camp. 

Bollettieri died at home in Bradenton, Florida, on December 4, 2022, at age 91.

==Honors==
On May 18, 2008, Bollettieri was honored at the New York College of Health Professions with an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters for his contribution to the world of sports, fitness, and wellness.

In 2014, he was inducted to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The following year, Bollettieri became the first white man to be inducted into the Black Tennis Hall of Fame.

<text>Power over Ethernet (PoE) describes any of several standards or ad hoc systems that pass electric power along with data on twisted-pair Ethernet cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both a data connection and enough electricity to power networked devices such as wireless access points (WAPs), IP cameras and VoIP phones.

==Techniques==
There are several common techniques for transmitting power over Ethernet cabling, defined within the broader Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 standard since 2003.

The three techniques are:
*&quot;Alternative A&quot;, which uses the same two of the four signal pairs that 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX use for data in typical Cat 5 cabling. 
*&quot;Alternative B&quot;, which separates the data and the power conductors for 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX, making troubleshooting easier.
*&quot;4PPoE&quot;, which uses all four twisted pairs in parallel, increasing the achievable power. 

&quot;Alternative A&quot; transmits power on the same wires as data for common 10 and Ethernet variants. This is similar to the phantom power technique commonly used for powering condenser microphones. Power is transmitted on the data conductors by applying a common voltage to each pair. Because twisted-pair Ethernet uses differential signaling, this does not interfere with data transmission. The common-mode voltage is easily extracted using the center tap of the standard Ethernet pulse transformer. For gigabit Ethernet and faster, both alternatives &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; transmit power on wire pairs also used for data since all four pairs are used for data transmission at these speeds.

&quot;4PPoE&quot; provides power using all four pairs of the connectors used for twisted-pair Ethernet. This enables higher power for applications like pan–tilt–zoom cameras (PTZ), high-performance wireless access points (WAPs), or even charging laptop batteries.

In addition to standardizing existing practice for common-mode data pair (&quot;Alternative A&quot;), spare-pair (&quot;Alternative B&quot;), and four-pair (&quot;4PPoE&quot;) transmission, the IEEE PoE standards provide for signaling between the &quot;power sourcing equipment&quot; (&quot;PSE&quot;) and &quot;powered device&quot; (&quot;PD&quot;). This signaling allows the presence of a conformant device to be detected by the power source and allows the device and source to negotiate the amount of power required or available while avoiding damage to non-compatible devices.

==Standards development==
===Two- and four-pair Ethernet===
The original PoE standard, &quot;IEEE 802.3af-2003&quot;, now known as &quot;Type 1&quot;, provides up to 15.4 W of DC power (minimum and 350 mA) on each port. Only 12.95 W is guaranteed to be available at the powered device as some power dissipates in the cable.

The first update to PoE, &quot;IEEE 802.3at-2009&quot;, introduced &quot;Type 2&quot;, also known as &quot;PoE+&quot; or &quot;PoE plus&quot;. It provides up to 25.5 W and prohibits the use of four pairs simultaneously for power.

Both of these standards, 802.3af and 802.3at, were later incorporated into the IEEE 802.3-2012 publication.

Later &quot;Type 3&quot; and &quot;Type 4&quot; were introduced in &quot;IEEE 802.3bt-2018&quot;, respectively supporting up to 51 W and up to 71.3 W delivered power, optionally by using all four pairs for power. Each pair needs to handle a current of up to 600 mA (Type 3) or 960 mA (Type 4). Additionally, support for 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T and 10GBASE-T is included. This development opens the door to new applications and expands the use of applications such as high-performance wireless access points and surveillance cameras.

IEEE 802.3bt was incorporated into 802.3 in the 2022 revision.

===Single-pair Ethernet===
The &quot;IEEE 802.3bu-2016&quot; amendment introduced &quot;single-pair&quot; &quot;Power over Data Lines ()&quot; for the single-pair Ethernet standards 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 intended for automotive and industrial applications. On the two-pair and four-pair standards, the same power voltage is applied to each conductor of the pair, so that within each pair there is no differential voltage other than that representing the transmitted data. With single-pair Ethernet, power is transmitted in parallel to the data. PoDL initially defined ten power classes, ranging from 0.5 to 50 W (at PD).

Subsequently, PoDL was added to the single-pair variants 10BASE-T1, 2.5GBASE-T1, 5GBASE-T1, and 10GBASE-T1, and it includes a total of 15 power classes with additional intermediate voltage and power levels.

==Uses==
Examples of devices powered by PoE include:
* VoIP phones
* IP cameras, including PTZs
* WAPs
* IPTV decoders
* Network routers
* A small network switch, providing a small number of Ethernet ports from one uplink cable. Such a switch may in turn pass PoE to downstream devices (termed &quot;PoE pass-through&quot;).
* Intercom and public address systems
* Wall clocks, with time set using Network Time Protocol (NTP)
* Roof-mounted radios with integrated antennas, 4G/LTE-, 802.11- or 802.16-based systems used by wireless ISPs
* Outdoor point-to-point microwave and millimeter-wave radios and some free space optics units, usually using non-standard, proprietary PoE
* Industrial control system components including sensors, controllers, meters etc.
* Access control components including help points, intercoms, keyless entry, etc.
* Lighting controllers and light-emitting diode (LED) lighting fixtures
* Stage and theatrical devices, such as networked audio breakout and routing boxes
* Remote point-of-sale (POS) kiosks
* Ethernet repeaters, or &quot;extenders&quot;, which may also pass PoE through to downstream devices
* PoE splitters that output the power in a different form (e.g. USB Power Delivery), to power a remote device or charge a mobile phone

==Terminology==

===Power sourcing equipment===
802.3 refers to &quot;Power Sourcing Equipment&quot; (PSE), which provides power on the Ethernet cable. This device may be a network switch, in the standard &quot;Endpoint PSE&quot; (commonly called an &quot;endspan device&quot;) or a &quot;PoE injector&quot;, &quot;Midspan PSE&quot; in the standard, an intermediary device between a switch that does not provide PoE (or one that cannot provide sufficient power) and a PoE-powered device.

===Powered device===
802.3 refers to any PoE-powered piece of equipment as a &quot;Powered Device&quot; (PD). Examples include wireless access points, VoIP phones, and IP cameras.

Many powered devices have an auxiliary power connector for an optional external power supply. Depending on the design, some, none, or all of the device&#x27;s power can be supplied from the auxiliary port, with the auxiliary port also sometimes providing backup power in case PoE-supplied power fails.

==Power management features and integration==

Advocates of PoE expect PoE to become a global long-term DC power cabling standard and replace a multiplicity of individual AC adapters, which cannot be easily centrally managed. Critics of this approach argue that PoE is inherently less efficient than AC power due to the lower voltage, and this is made worse by the thin conductors of Ethernet. Advocates of PoE, like the Ethernet Alliance, point out that quoted losses are for worst-case scenarios in terms of cable quality, length and power consumption by powered devices. In any case, where the central PoE supply replaces several dedicated AC circuits, transformers and inverters, the power loss in cabling can be justifiable.

===Integrating EEE and PoE===
The integration of PoE with the IEEE 802.3az Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) standard potentially produces additional energy savings. Pre-standard integrations of EEE and PoE (such as Marvell&#x27;s EEPoE outlined in a May 2011 white paper) claim to achieve a savings upwards of 3 W per link. This saving is especially significant as higher-power devices come online.

==Standard implementation==
Standards-based Power over Ethernet is implemented following the specifications in IEEE 802.3af-2003 (which was later incorporated as Clause 33 into IEEE 802.3-2005) or the 2009 update, IEEE 802.3at. The standards require Category 5 cable or better for high power levels but allow using Category 3 cable if less power is required.

Power is supplied as a common-mode signal over two or more of the differential pairs of wires found in the Ethernet cables and comes from a power supply within a PoE-providing networking device, such as an Ethernet switch, or by a &quot;PoE injector&quot;, a PoE power source that can be used in combination with a non-PoE switch.

A phantom power technique is used to allow the powered pairs to also carry data. This permits its use not only with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, which use only two of the four pairs in the cable, but also with 1000BASE-T (gigabit Ethernet), 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T, and 10GBASE-T which use all four pairs for data transmission. This is possible because all versions of Ethernet over twisted pair cable specify differential data transmission over each pair with transformer coupling; the DC supply and load connections can be made to the transformer center-taps at each end. Each pair thus operates in common mode as one side of the DC supply, so two pairs are required to complete the circuit. The polarity of the DC supply may be inverted by crossover cables; the powered device must operate with either pair: the spare pairs on pins 4 and 5, and 7 and 8, or the data pairs on pins 1 and 2, and 3 and 6. Polarity is defined by the standards on spare pairs, and ambiguously implemented for data pairs, with the use of a diode bridge.

Notes:
===Powering devices===
Three modes, &quot;Mode A&quot;, &quot;Mode B&quot;, and &quot;4-pair mode&quot;, are available. (In the standard these are discussed as two Modes, with the term &quot;4-pair mode&quot; for both simultaneously.) Mode A delivers power on T568A and T568B pairs 2 and 3the data pairs of 100BASE-TX or 10BASE-T. Mode B delivers power on pairs 1 and 4the pairs not used by 100BASE-TX or 10BASE-T. 4-pair mode delivers power using all four pairs. PoE can also be used with 1000BASE-T, 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T and 10GBASE-T Ethernet, in which case there are no spare pairs and all power is delivered using the &quot;phantom&quot; technique.

Mode A has two alternative configurations (MDI and MDI-X), using the same pairs but with different polarities. In Mode A, pins 1 and 2 (pair 3 in T568A wiring, pair 2 in T568B) form one side of the 48 V DC, and pins 3 and 6 (pair 2 in T568A, pair 3 in T568B) form the other side. These are the same two pairs used for data transmission in 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, allowing the provision of both power and data over only two pairs in such networks. The free polarity allows PoE to accommodate crossover cables, patch cables and auto MDI-X.

In Mode B, pins 4–5 (pair 1 in both T568A and T568B) form one side of the DC supply and pins 7–8 (pair 4 in both T568A and T568B) provide the return; these are the pairs 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX do not use. Mode B, therefore, requires that all four pairs of the connectors be wired.

The &quot;Power Sourcing Equipment&quot; (&quot;PSE&quot;), not the &quot;Powered Device&quot; (&quot;PD&quot;), decides whether Mode A or Mode B shall be used. PDs that implement only Mode A or Mode B are disallowed by the standard. The PSE can implement Mode A, Mode B, or both (&quot;4-pair mode&quot;). A PD indicates that it is standards-compliant by placing a 25 kΩ resistor between the powered pairs. If the PSE detects a resistance that is too high or too low (including a short circuit), no power is applied. This protects devices that do not support PoE. An optional &quot;power class&quot; feature allows the PD to indicate its power requirements by changing the &quot;sense resistance&quot; at higher voltages.

To retain power, the PD must use at least 5–10 mA for at least 60 ms at a time. If the PD goes more than 400 ms without meeting this requirement, the PSE will consider the device disconnected and, for safety reasons, remove power.

There are two types of PSE: &quot;Endpoint&quot; and &quot;Midspan&quot;. Endpoint devices (commonly PoE switches) are Ethernet networking equipment that includes the power-over-Ethernet transmission circuitry. Midspan devices are &quot;power injectors&quot; that stand between a non-PoE Ethernet switch (or one that cannot provide sufficient power) and the powered device, &quot;injecting&quot; power without affecting the data. Endpoint devices are normally used in new installations or where the switch has to be replaced for other reasons (such as moving from to ), which makes it convenient to add the PoE capability. Midspan PSE can be used e.g. to power a single piece of equipment added to a network that does not provide PoE.

IEEE 802.3at-capable devices are also referred to as &quot;Type 2&quot;. 802.3at PSE may also use LLDP communication to signal 802.3at capability.

Class 4 can only be used by IEEE 802.3at (Type 2) devices, requiring valid Class 2 and Mark 2 currents for the power-up stages. An 802.3af device presenting a Class 4 current is non-compliant and, instead, will be treated as a Class 0 device.

===Configuration via Ethernet LLDP===
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a layer-2 Ethernet protocol for managing devices. LLDP allows an exchange of information between PSE and a PD. This information is formatted in type–length–value (TLV) format. PoE standards define TLV structures used by PSE and PDs to signal and negotiate available power.



The setup phases are as follows:
* The PSE (provider) tests the PD (consumer) physically using 802.3af phase class 3.
** The PSE provides baseline power to the PD.
* The PD signals to the PSE that it as a PoE PD, indicating its maximum power and requested power.
* The PSE signals to PD that it is PoE PSE, indicating the power allotted to the PD, at which point the PD can begin consuming up to the allotted power.

The rules for this power negotiation are:
* The PD shall never request more power than the physical 802.3af class.
* The PD shall never draw more than the maximum power advertised by the PSE.
* The PSE may deny any PD drawing more power than maximum it has allowed.
* The PSE shall not reduce power allocated to the PD that is in use.
* The PSE may &quot;request&quot; reduced power, via conservation mode.

==Non-standard implementations==
There are more than ten proprietary implementations. The more common ones are discussed below.
===Cisco===
Some Cisco WLAN access points and VoIP phones supported a proprietary form of PoE many years before there was an IEEE standard for delivering PoE. Cisco&#x27;s original PoE implementation is not software upgradeable to the IEEE 802.3af standard. Cisco&#x27;s original PoE equipment is capable of delivering up to per port. The amount of power to be delivered is negotiated between the endpoint and the Cisco switch based on a power value that was added to the Cisco proprietary Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP). CDP is also responsible for dynamically communicating the Voice VLAN value from the Cisco switch to the Cisco VoIP Phone.

Under Cisco&#x27;s pre-standard scheme, the PSE (switch) will send a fast link pulse (FLP) on the transmit pair. The PD (device) connects the transmit line to the receive line via a low-pass filter. The PSE gets the FLP in return. The PSE will provide a common mode current between pairs 1 and 2, resulting in and default of allocated power. The PD must then provide Ethernet link within to the auto-negotiation mode switch port. A later CDP message with a TLV tells the PSE its final power requirement. A discontinuation of link pulses shuts down power.

In 2014, Cisco created another non-standard PoE implementation called (UPOE). UPOE can use all four pairs, after negotiation, to supply up to 60 W.

===Analog Devices===
A proprietary high-power development called LTPoE++, using a single Cat 5e Ethernet cable, is capable of supplying varying levels at 38.7, 52.7, 70, and 90 W.

===Microsemi===
PowerDsine, acquired by Microsemi in 2007, which was then acquired by Microchip in 2018, has been selling power injectors since 1999. Using Microchip&#x27;s multi-PoE PSE ICs, PoE injectors and switches can support the IEEE 802.3 PoE standards and also pre-standard configurations. Several companies such as Polycom, 3Com, Lucent and Nortel used PowerDsine&#x27;s older &quot;Power over LAN&quot; PoE implementation.

===Passive===
In a passive PoE system, the injector does not communicate with the powered device to negotiate its voltage or wattage requirements but merely supplies power at all times. Common passive applications use the pinout of 802.3af mode B (see )with DC positive on pins 4 and 5 and negative on 7 and 8, and data on 1 and 2, and 3 and 6, but polarization may vary. Gigabit passive injectors use a transformer on the data pins to allow power and data to share the cable and are typically compatible with 802.3af Mode A. Passive injectors with up to 12 ports are available.

Devices needing 5 volts cannot typically use PoE at 5 V on Ethernet cable beyond short distances (about ) as the voltage drop of the cable becomes too significant, so a 24 V or 48 V to 5 V DC-DC converter is required at the remote end.

Passive PoE power sources are commonly used with a variety of indoor and outdoor wireless radio equipment, most commonly from Motorola (now Cambium), Ubiquiti Networks, MikroTik and others. Earlier versions of passive PoE 24 VDC power sources shipped with 802.11a, 802.11g and 802.11n-based radios are commonly only.

Passive DC-to-DC injectors also exist which convert a 9 V to 36 V DC, or 36 V to 72 V DC power source to a stabilized 24 V 1 A, 48 V 0.5 A, or up to 48 V 2.0 A PoE feed with &#x27;+&#x27; on pins 4 &amp; 5 and &#x27;−&#x27; on pins 7 &amp; 8. These DC-to-DC PoE injectors are used in various telecom applications.

==Power capacity limits==
The ISO/IEC TR 29125 and Cenelec EN 50174-99-1 draft standards outline the cable bundle temperature rise that can be expected from the use of 4PPoE. A distinction is made between two scenarios: 
# bundles heating up from the inside to the outside, and 
# bundles heating up from the outside to match the ambient temperature. 
The second scenario largely depends on the environment and installation, whereas the first is solely influenced by the cable construction. In a standard unshielded cable, the PoE-related temperature rise increases by a factor of 5. In a shielded cable, this value drops to between 2.5 and 3, depending on the design.

<text>Dervla Kirwan (born 24 October 1971) is an Irish actress. She has received a number of accolades, including two IFTA Awards for her performances in the film &quot;Ondine&quot; (2009) and the RTÉ thriller series &quot;Smother&quot; (2021–2023) respectively.

Kirwan began her career in the BBC series &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; (1993–1996) and &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; (1996–1998), the latter of which won her a National Television Award. This was followed by further BBC roles in &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; (2000–2001), &quot;55 Degrees North&quot; (2004–2005), &quot;True Dare Kiss&quot; (2007), &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;The Silence&quot; (both 2010). She also guest starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; (2008).

==Early life==
Kirwan was born in Churchtown, Dublin, Ireland. Her father, Peter Kirwan, was an insurance broker, and her mother, Maureen O&#x27;Driscoll, was a language teacher. She is the youngest of three daughters. She attended Loreto Beaufort in Rathfarnham, Dublin, a Catholic school for girls, until the age of 16, when she was asked to leave as her career as an actress started to progress. Kirwan completed secondary school at the now-defunct non-denominational Sandymount High School in Dublin.

During an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that aired in 2010, Kirwan learned more about her ancestors. Her great-grandmother was Margaret Collins-O&#x27;Driscoll, sister of Irish nationalist leader Michael Collins. Her maternal grandfather, Finian O&#x27;Driscoll, was Collins&#x27;s nephew, and served three years with the Irish Republican Army.

Her paternal grandfather, Henry Kahn, was a Polish Jewish immigrant who had married her grandmother, Teresa O&#x27;Shea, a Catholic, in Ireland. In 1902, anti-Semitic judge Frederick Falkiner sentenced Kahn to a year in prison for breaking a shop window. The trial was known as a &quot;notorious miscarriage of justice&quot; and likely inspired a passage in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

==Career==

===Television===

Kirwan&#x27;s first credited TV roles were in the TV series &quot;Troubles&quot; in 1988 and &quot;The Lilac Bus&quot; in 1990 alongside Stephanie Beacham based on Maeve Binchy&#x27;s novel.

Her breakthrough television role was appearing in the 1991 BBC Scotland production of &quot;A Time To Dance&quot;, adapted by Melvyn Bragg from his own novel, playing Bernadette Kennedy.

Kirwan briefly appeared in &quot;Casualty&quot;, and in the first three seasons of &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; alongside Nicholas Lyndhurst.

For 23 episodes, from 1996 to 1998, she appeared in &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; in the role of Assumpta Fitzgerald, the landlady of the village&#x27;s only pub, Fitzgerald&#x27;s. She reprised this role for a Comic Relief special of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, and for a &quot;Father Ted&quot; special.

In 1999, she appeared in another BBC production, a made for TV Christmas film called &quot;The Greatest Store in the World&quot;. She played the single mother of two girls who are made homeless a few days before Christmas. Kirwan co-starred with Brian Blessed and Peter Capaldi. In 2001, she starred as Emma Rose in a BBC series &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; alongside Sarah Parish, Amanda Holden, Hugo Speer and Damian Lewis. The show ran for two seasons. She also starred in the Sky TV series &quot;The Bombmaker&quot; as a former IRA bomb maker.

She appeared in the BBC 1 crime drama series &quot;55 Degrees North&quot; with Don Gilet, which aired in 2004. She returned for a second season in 2005. The series was shown in the US under the title &quot;The Night Detective&quot;.

In 2007, she appeared in the BBC drama &quot;True Dare Kiss&quot;.

Kirwan appeared as the villain Miss Mercy Hartigan in &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, the 2008 Christmas special of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, alongside David Tennant and David Morrissey.

In 2009, Kirwan was in the BBC drama &quot;Moving On&quot;, where she played Laura in the episode &quot;Dress To Impress&quot;. She also guest starred in &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;, playing the role of Beatrice McArdle.

Kirwan appeared in the BBC drama series &quot;Material Girl&quot;, which aired in January 2010. She was also cast in the role of Bundle in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;.

Kirwan also appeared in the four-part BBC drama &quot;The Silence&quot; in 2010. She played the role of Maggie, the warm-hearted aunt of a young deaf girl who witnessed a murder. &quot;The Silence&quot; aired in July 2010.

<text>Kilmacanogue, officially Kilmacanoge (), is a village in north County Wicklow, Ireland. It is southwest of Bray and is overlooked by Great Sugar Loaf mountain.

==Location==
It lies between the Little Sugar Loaf to the east and the Great Sugar Loaf to the west in the northeastern foothills of the Wicklow Mountains, near the Glen of the Downs.

Two small streams join in Kilmacanogue, behind the old Post Office (Donnelly&#x27;s), to form the Kilmacanogue River, which flows into the River Dargle near the old &quot;Silver Bridge&quot; at Kilbride, approximately two miles to the north, just downstream of the confluence with the Cookstown River.

==History==
The village is named after &quot;Saint Mocheanog&quot;, a companion of Saint Patrick&#x27;s who, according to legend, baptised the Children of Lir just before their death.

On the morning of 1 January 1942, the German Luftwaffe dropped two magnetic mines near Kilmacanogue but they did not explode.

==Amenities==
The village has two petrol stations, a primary school, a church, and an old coaching house dating back to the 19th century. The Plucks were a family who lived in the area in the 1800s and early 1900s. It was a place where teams of horses were changed and stabled on the old road to Wicklow and further south. Charles Stewart Parnell was a frequent passenger on his way to his family house in Avondale – hence his moniker &quot;The Blackbird of Avondale&quot; – a ballad sung in his memory. It was not until 1861 that the railway was opened as far as Rathdrum, hence the need to travel by coach up to that time.

==Business==
Avoca Handweavers have one of their earliest outlets at the northern end of the village. This is situated on the site of Glencormac House which was completed in 1860 by the Jameson Whiskey family, who were originally from Scotland. The house became a hotel (Grade A, a precursor to five-star rated hotels) in the 1950s but was razed to the ground in a fire that occurred in 1967.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
The village lies on the junction of the R755 road to Roundwood and the N11 road, southeast of Bray town centre.

=== Bus ===
Kilmacanogue is served by the 45A/B bus to Dún Laoghaire via Bray, Shankill, and Ballybrack.

Until 2014, it was served by Dublin Bus route 145 to Heuston Station; however, this was cut short to terminate in Ballywaltrim and the 45A route was extended to serve Kilmacanogue. Only a small number of route 145 journeys still continue to Kilmacanogue on weekdays.

The village is also served by Bus Éireann routes 131 (to Wicklow and Bray), and 133 (to Wicklow and Dublin Busáras), as well as St. Kevin&#x27;s Bus route 181 to Dublin and Glendalough (via Roundwood &amp; Laragh), and Wexford Bus routes 740 to Wexford (via Arklow, Gorey, and Enniscorthy), 740A to Gorey via Arklow and Wicklow, 740X to Wexford, and the once a day UM11 to Maynooth University (via Leixlip).

==Clubs and organisations==
Kilmacanogue is home to the Kilmacanogue GAA Club, a Scouting Ireland group, Kilmac Drama, karate, Kilmacanogue History Society, and Glencormac United football club.

==Notable people==
* Mary Coughlan, singer, was living in Kilmacanogue as at January 2021
* Mariella Frostrup, journalist and broadcaster

<text>Stephen Joel Barrett (; born 1933) is an American retired psychiatrist, author, co-founder of the National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF), and the webmaster of Quackwatch. He runs a number of websites dealing with quackery and health fraud. He focuses on consumer protection, medical ethics, and scientific skepticism.

==Early life and education==
Barrett was born in New York City. He is a 1957 graduate of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and completed his psychiatry residency in 1961. In 1968, he completed part of a correspondence course in American Law and Procedure at La Salle Extension University in Chicago.

==Career==
Barrett was a practicing physician until retiring from active practice in 1993. , his medical license was listed as &quot;Expired&quot; in good standing: &quot;No disciplinary actions were found for this license.&quot; A longtime resident of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Barrett now resides in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

In addition to webmastering his websites, Barrett was a co-founder, vice-president and a board member of the National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF). He is a scientific advisor to the American Council on Science and Health, and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). From 1987 through 1989, he taught health education at Pennsylvania State University.

Barrett was the consulting editor for the Consumer Health Library at Prometheus Books, and has been a peer-review panelist for two medical journals. He has also served on the editorial board of Medscape and the &quot;Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine&quot;. According to his website, he &quot;has written more than 2,000 articles and delivered more than 300 talks at colleges, universities, medical schools, and professional meetings. His media appearances include &quot;Dateline&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Primetime&quot;, &quot;Donahue&quot;, CNN, National Public Radio, and more than 200 other radio and television talk show interviews.&quot;

Quackwatch received the award of Best Physician-Authored Site by MD NetGuide, May 2003. In 1984, he received an FDA Commissioner&#x27;s Special Citation Award for Public Service in fighting nutrition quackery. He was included in the list of outstanding skeptics of the 20th century by &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine. In 1986, he was awarded honorary membership in the American Dietetic Association. Barrett has been profiled in &quot;Biography Magazine&quot; (1998) and in &quot;Time&quot; (2001).

The magazine &quot;Spiked&quot; included Barrett in a survey of 134 persons they termed &quot;key thinkers in science, technology and medicine.&quot; When he was asked: &quot;What inspired you to take up science?&quot; he replied that his appreciation of medical science:

probably began when I took a college course in medical statistics, and learned what makes the difference between scientific thought and poor reasoning. Medical school brought me in touch with the rapid and amazing strides being made in the understanding and treatment of disease. My anti-quackery activities have intensified my interest and concern in distinguishing science from pseudoscience, quackery and fraud.

===Quackwatch===

The Quackwatch website is Barrett&#x27;s main platform for describing and exposing what he and other contributors consider to be quackery and health fraud. The website was part of Quackwatch, Inc., a nonprofit corporation founded by Barrett that aims to &quot;combat health-related frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct.&quot; The non-profit was dissolved in 2008. Barrett&#x27;s writing is supplemented with contributions from many scientific, technical, and lay volunteers and includes numerous references to published research articles. Barrett defines &quot;quackery&quot; as &quot;anything involving overpromotion in the field of health,&quot; and reserves the word &quot;fraud&quot; &quot;only for situations in which deliberate deception is involved.&quot;
Barrett has become a &quot;lightning rod&quot; for controversy as a result of his criticisms of alternative medicine theories and practitioners. Barrett says he does not criticize conventional medicine because that would be &quot;way outside [his] scope.&quot; He states he does not give equal time to some subjects, and has written on his web site that &quot;Quackery and fraud don&#x27;t involve legitimate controversy and are not balanced subjects. I don&#x27;t believe it is helpful to publish &#x27;balanced&#x27; articles about unbalanced subjects.&quot; Barrett is at the forefront of exposing questionable aspects of chiropractic.

Barrett is a strong supporter of the HONcode and has made efforts to improve compliance with its rules and to expose those who abuse it.

A number of practitioners and supporters of alternative medicine oppose Barrett and Quackwatch for its criticism of alternative medicine. Donna Ladd, a journalist with &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, says Barrett relies mostly on negative research to criticize alternative medicine, rejecting most positive case studies as unreliable due to methodological flaws. According to Ladd, Barrett insists that most alternative therapies &quot;simply should be disregarded without further research. &#x27;A lot of things don&#x27;t need to be tested [because] they simply don&#x27;t make any sense&#x27;, he says, pointing to homeopathy, chiropractic, and acupuncture as examples of alternative treatments with no plausible mechanism of action.&quot;

Both website reviews and various journal articles mention or use as references Stephen Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Quackwatch&quot; as a useful source for consumer information. However, other authors have criticised Quackwatch as being overly biased in its presentation.

In February 2020, Quackwatch became part of the Center for Inquiry. CFI maintains its various websites.

<text>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive is a historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words and terms from Indian languages which came into use during British rule in India.

It was written by Sir Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell and first published in 1886. Burnell died before the work was finished, and most of it was completed by Yule, who acknowledged Burnell&#x27;s detailed contributions. A subsequent edition was edited by William Crooke in 1903, with extra quotations and an index added. The first and second editions are collector&#x27;s items; the second edition is widely available in facsimile.

The dictionary holds over 2,000 entries, generally with citations from literary sources, some of which date to the first European contact with the Indian subcontinent, frequently in other non-English European languages. Most entries also have etymological notes.

== Background ==
The project began through correspondence between Sir Henry Yule, who was then living in Palermo, and Arthur Coke Burnell, who was a member of the Madras Civil Service, and was holding posts in several places in South India, and particularly, in Thanjavur. In 1872, Burnell wrote to Yule that he had been collecting instances of Anglo-Indian usages of English, as Yule had also been working on a similar list of his own. At Yule&#x27;s suggestion, they combined their projects, working together until Burnell&#x27;s death in 1882. Yule and Burnell compiled the text by using a variety of sources, including accounts of Anglo-Indian language and usages by other authors of the time, as well as government documents such as glossaries of revenue administrative and legislative terms, and contemporary dictionaries.

== Title ==
In Indian English, the term &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; referred to any festival or entertainment, but especially ceremonies of the Mourning of Muharram. In origin, the term is a corruption by British soldiers of &quot;Yā Ḥasan! Yā Ḥosain!&quot; which is repeatedly chanted by Shia Muslims throughout the procession of the Muharram; this was then converted to Hosseen Gosseen, Hossy Gossy, Hossein Jossen and, ultimately, Hobson-Jobson. Yule and Burnell wrote that they considered the title a &quot;typical and delightful example&quot; of the type of highly domesticated words in the dictionary that also implied their own dual authorship.

The scholar Traci Nagle, however, also finds a note of condescension in the choice. Rhyming reduplication (as in &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; or &quot;puli kili&quot;) is highly productive in South Asian languages, where it is known popularly as an echo word. In English, however, rhyming reduplication is generally either juvenile (as in Humpty Dumpty or hokey-pokey) or pejorative (as in namby-pamby or mumbo-jumbo); further, Hobson and Jobson were stock characters in Victorian times, used to indicate a pair of yokels, clowns, or idiots. The title thus produced negative associations – being at best self-deprecatory on the part of the authors, suggesting themselves a pair of idiots – and reviewers reacted negatively to the title, generally praising the book but finding the title inappropriate. Indeed, anticipating this reaction, the title was kept secret – even from the publisher – until shortly before publication.

==Influence and evaluations==
The volume received praise on its initial publication from, among others, Rudyard Kipling. Paul Pelliot, the French Sinologist, welcomed the 1903 version, though including a list of corrections and questions.

More recently, however, the scholar Vijay Mishra objected that neither Yule nor Burnell had sound training in the languages required. He further objected that &quot;it may be said that built into these hobson-jobsons is a contemptuous attitude, an ironic belittling of the values contained in the original vernacular words.&quot; That is, the British colonialists represented in the volume did not know or care to know the original meanings of the words. He gives as an example the word &quot;babu” (babú) which in the original is “an educated or distinguished person&quot; and a term of respect. But as a hobson-jobson “baboo&quot; is degrading as it &quot;attempts to reduce educated Indians (especially Bengalis) to mimics and harlequins.&quot;

James A. Murray made extensive use of &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; in writing entries on South Asian words for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

== Law of Hobson-Jobson ==
The term &quot;law of Hobson-Jobson&quot; is sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the process of phonological change by which loanwords are adapted to the phonology of the new language, as in the archetypal example of &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; itself. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third International Dictionary&quot; gives as examples of the law of Hobson-Jobson: Spanish becoming English , and English becoming French .

<text>Maxmo () is a former municipality of Finland. It was located in the province of Western Finland and was part of the Ostrobothnia region. The municipality was consolidated with Vörå to form the new municipality of Vörå-Maxmo in 2007.

The former municipality had a population of 1,037 (2003) and covered an area of 148.06 km² of which one fourth was land. The population density was 7.0 inhabitants per km². The majority were speakers of Swedish (90%) and the minority speakers of Finnish (8%).

Maxmo was part of the Kvarken Archipelago. The Kvarken Archipelago is continuously rising from the sea at a rate among the highest in the world. During the last 600 years, over a third of the land areas in Maxmo has risen from the sea. That means over of new land every year.

In July 2006 Kvarken Archipelago was added as an extension to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of The High Coast. The archipelago is unique in that it features ridged washboard moraines known as De Geer moraines, formed by the melting of the continental ice sheet 10,000 to 24,000 years ago.</text><links>

== History ==

Masku is one of the oldest parishes in Finland, having been established in the 13th century. It included Merimasku until 1577, when it was transferred to Naantali. The people of Masku also once held hunting grounds in the Turku archipelago, as evidenced by the toponym &quot;Maskinnamo&quot; (originally &quot;*Maskun Innanmaa&quot;) in Korpo. There is also a village called &quot;Maskulainen&quot; in both Rymättylä and Lemu, suggesting that the first settlers of those villages came from Masku.

Lemu and Askainen were consolidated with Masku in 2009. Masku adopted Askainen&#x27;s coat of arms after the merger.

==Notable people==
The most famous resident of Masku is Finnish tennis player Jarkko Nieminen. Well known football players from Masku include Kasper Hämäläinen, Riku Riski and Roope Riski. Baron C. G. E. Mannerheim, field marshal and 6th President of Finland was born in Louhisaari Manor of Askainen in 1867.

<doc id="782867" wikidata="Q1009215" url="?curid=782867" title="Merikarvia">
<text>Merikarvia (; ) is a municipality in Finland. It is located in the Satakunta region. The neighboring municipalities are Isojoki, Kristinestad, Pomarkku, Pori and Siikainen.

The municipality has a population of 3,169
(2024) and it covers an area of , of
which 
is water. The population density is

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The coastline was formerly Swedish-speaking. Merikarvia is known for the Oura Archipelago, which is part of the Bothnian Sea National Park.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since as early as 1800 BC. There are grave sites from the Bronze and Iron Ages within the municipality. Most of the cairns are located in Tuorila village located east of the municipal center.

The area of Merikarvia was initially held by the people of Sastamala (Karkku and Tyrvää) as hunting grounds, which is the origin of the Swedish name &quot;Sastmola&quot;. The name was first mentioned in 1303 as &quot;Sastamall&quot;.

The birth of the earliest villages in Merikarvia - Kasala, Riispyy, Alakylä, Ylikylä and Köörtilä - is dated to between the 13th and 14th centuries.

Merikarvia was a part of the Ulvila parish until 1639. Municipal administration was adopted in 1865. Siikainen became a chapel community under Merikarvia in 1772 and was separated from Merikarvia as a parish in 1861 and as a municipality in 1871.

The first church in Merikarvia was built in 1776 and was named after the queen consort of Sweden at the time, Sofia Magdalena. The church, still in use today, was finished in 1899.

As a coastal municipality, Merikarvia largely lived from the sea until modern times. Fishing, sawmills and shipyards were common businesses until the end of the 19th century.

=== Language and dialect ===
Like neighboring Ahlainen (Vittisbofjärd), Merikarvia was originally predominantly Swedish-speaking due to the Swedish settlement in the area during the Middle Ages. The Swedish language mostly disappeared from the area in the early 20th century, mainly remaining in the village of Kasala (Kasaböle) near the border with Sideby. Kasala became a majority Finnish-speaking village between the 20th and 21st centuries.

A Swedish-language school was active in Kasala from 1897 until 1967.

The Finnish dialect of Merikarvia is a southwestern dialect, similar to the other dialects of northern Satakunta. The dialects of Merikarvia and Ahlainen are among the few dialects of Finnish where the sound /d/ is used in native words (e.g. &quot;lähde&quot;), as in standard Finnish. Most other dialects of the area use /r/ in its place.

==Politics==

Results of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Merikarvia:

*Centre Party 35.7%
*True Finns 23.7%
*Social Democratic Party 18.6%
*National Coalition Party 11.3%
*Left Alliance 6.1%
*Christian Democrats 2.6%
*Green League 1.7%

From 1955 to 1968, the group appeared regularly on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; (receiving union scale wages) before having their own television variety show, called &quot;Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters&quot;, with Jimmy Durante. After the show was cancelled, they partnered with Andy Williams to create a successful Las Vegas residency, which lasted a decade. In 1999, younger sister Mimi (born Miriam Theresa, October 16, 1955) replaced Peggy upon the latter&#x27;s retirement. DeeDee has also since retired. The current line-up of the Lennon Sisters is a trio consisting of Kathy, Janet, and Mimi. They continue to tour around the country and, until recently, performed annually with their Christmas show at The Andy Williams Moon River Theatre in Branson, Missouri.

The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.

== Early life ==
The Lennon Sisters were born into a family of twelve children (seven sisters and five brothers), all born in Los Angeles, California in the United states. Their youngest sister, Mary Frances, died in 1954 when she was 16 months old after wandering into the street from the front lawn and being struck by a car. Their parents married in early 1939. Their father, William Herbert Lennon (1915–1969), worked as a milkman for many years before getting a job at a local golf course. Their mother, Isabelle Emily &quot;Sis&quot; (1919–2005), remained at home to care for the needs of her very large family. Sis was the daughter of Reina Ysabella Alvarez Denning and Danforth Denning. Their ancestry was a mixture of Mexican, Spanish, German, and Irish. Isabelle&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Pablo Alvarez (1857–1905), was born in Santa Ana, California, and her maternal grandmother, Margarita Camacho (1864–1938), was from Wilmington, California. Pablo&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, Bernardo Salgado De Oliberos, was born in San Andrés, Spain.

During their formative years, the family, which included two parents, eleven children, and one grandmother, lived in Venice, California, in a modest two-bedroom home at 1926 Penmar Ave and later at 1106 Garfield Ave. They were and are devout Roman Catholics and attended the Church of St. Mark, which is part of the Los Angeles Archdiocese. Most or all of the children attended Catholic school. Throughout the Lennon Sisters&#x27; career, their faith has had a major influence in both their lives and their careers. Many of their songs are either hymns or of a religious or spiritual nature.

== Career on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; ==
The quartet made its television debut on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; on Christmas Eve 1955. A high school classmate, Larry Welk, son of Lawrence Welk, brought them to the attention of his father. Welk was at home, sick in bed, when his son brought the sisters in to sing for him. Welk was so impressed that he immediately booked them for that week&#x27;s show, where they were a mainstay until they left to start a career of their own in 1968. The quartet was a trio from 1960 to 1964 after DeeDee married and left the group; she rejoined in 1964 (although making a small handful of appearances throughout her years not on the show). Peggy sang the high harmony, Kathy the low harmony, and Janet and DeeDee sang the middle and lead harmonies. Peggy also specialized in barbershop, or counter-harmony, singing, taught to her by her father (who performed during the Big Band Era in a quartet with his own three brothers). The girls idolized Patti Page&#x27;s multi-track vocal sound, feeling they achieved something close to her smooth blend in their Dot recording of &quot;Stars Fell on Alabama&quot;. Kathy was especially fond of Connie Francis, evident in her solo recording of &quot;Malaguena&quot;, which showcased her impressive vocal range. And also with the numerous hairstyles that Kathy would wear like her signature “swept wing look”. The sisters made no secret that they were huge fans of the innovative, intricate musical stylings of both The Andrews Sisters and The Mills Brothers.

Their first hit, &quot;Tonight, You Belong to Me&quot;, reached No. 15 on the charts in 1956. In 1961, their single &quot;Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)&quot; (Dot 16255) reached the top of the charts in Japan, although making it only to No. 56 on Billboard in the United States. It was the lone No. 1 single of their career, turning out to be their all-time highest-charting record. Although much of the group&#x27;s fame was based on their television appearances, they also recorded frequently for Dot Records in the 1950s and 1960s, producing a dozen albums, featuring their interpretations of well-known standards such as &quot;Among My Souvenirs&quot;, &quot;Moon River&quot;, and &quot;Twilight Time&quot;. Some of their best-known recordings included &quot;Scarlet Ribbons&quot;, &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. A themed LP titled &quot;Dominique&quot; featured the Lennon Sisters with their musically talented siblings and cousins performing a variety of 1960s folk songs, including &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone&quot; and &quot;If I Had My Way (The Sermon of Samson)&quot;, as well as the title track. They recorded briefly for Mercury Records after leaving Dot, focusing on more contemporary pop/light-rock fare, such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off of You&quot; and &quot;Never My Love&quot;. Their four most popular albums were &quot;Lawrence Welk Presents The Lennon Sisters: Best-Loved Catholic Hymns&quot; (Dot); &quot;Christmas with The Lennon Sisters&quot; (Dot); &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; (Dot);and &quot;Noel&quot;, their Christmas album for Mercury Records. Their full-bodied, homestyle choral blend was perfect for such yuletide favorites as &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot;, &quot;Christmas Island&quot;, &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;The Star Carol&quot;, and &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;.

Several souvenir items, such as coloring books, paper dolls, and story books featuring the Lennon sisters, were produced. Having growing families, the sisters were only receiving union scale wages for their jobs on the show. The Lennons and Lawrence Welk would agree that the sisters would appear on the show only once a month starting in 1967 so the sisters could pursue other opportunities and earn a bit more income for their families. However, over time this agreement would not work for Lawrence and in February 1968 the sisters were let go from the show. Singing the song “Sweet and Low” the Lennons and Welk would go their separate ways.

== Tragedy ==
In summer 1969, the Lennon Sisters were filming episodes for their upcoming variety series, &quot;Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters Hour&quot;. After filming five episodes, the Lennon Sisters went on a two-week hiatus. 
On August 12, 1969, their father, William Lennon, was shot and killed in the parking lot of the Venice Golf Course in Marina Del Rey, where he worked as a private instructor. Shortly before his death, Lennon had retired from managing his daughters&#x27; careers; he had been on set at every one of their television appearances since 1955. William Lennon was killed by a former Air Force officer named Chet Young. Young, who had previously been committed to Atascadero State Hospital and judged to be “dangerously insane”, believed that he was married to Peggy and was convinced that William Lennon stood in the way of his &quot;marriage&quot; to Peggy and had to be eliminated. Two months later, Young used the same weapon on himself to commit suicide. The sisters discovered an unopened letter containing a cut-out of their father, a picture of a gun pointed at his head, and the words &quot;High Noon&quot; (the time of the murder). The sisters were devastated by their father&#x27;s death, and in the wake of the murder, their new show was impacted by this tragedy and lasted only one and a half seasons.

== Later career ==
In the 1970s, the sisters performed regularly on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, and when that show ended in 1971, the sisters would tour around with Williams across the country, with engagements including Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They had a successful floor show with Williams in Las Vegas for about ten years. They also appeared on several game shows, including &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. In the spring of 1982, Larry Welk asked the Lennon Sisters if they would like to perform at the Welk Theater from May until New Year&#x27;s Eve for the Branson entertainment season. The four sisters moved their families from the Los Angeles area to Branson, Missouri. After the death of Lawrence Welk on May 17, 1992, the Lennon Sisters quartet headlined at the Welk Champagne Theater in Branson from 1994 to 2012. When Peggy retired from singing in 1999, younger sister Mimi took her place, and when Dianne left for a second time in 2001, the act was a trio again for the rest of its run in Branson. They continue to tour across the country and appear annually with their Christmas show at The Andy Williams Moon River Theatre, marking twenty consecutive years of performing in Branson.

Other than their thirteen years on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, the sister group would appear on many other different shows throughout the years, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot;, &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot;, &quot;Cher&quot;, &quot;Password Plus&quot; (Janet Lennon only), &quot;Soul Train&quot; (As a group in 1980 and 1984, and Kathy alone in 1988 and 1990), &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

While continuing to play tour dates, Kathy and Janet Lennon have branched out into the toy market in 2006, designing and selling a line of &quot;Best Pals&quot; dolls. In addition to the dolls, the sisters have recorded CDs of favorite children&#x27;s songs for the &quot;Best Pals&quot; line. The four original Lennon Sisters wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Same Song, Separate Voices&quot;, first published in 1985, with a new edition in 1995. In 2011, &quot;The Lennon Sisters: Same Song, Separate Voices&quot; (using the same name as the book), a musical documentary celebrating the group&#x27;s fifty-five years in show business, aired on PBS, although an updated version of the tv special was aired on PBS in 2020.

Two of their five brothers, Kipp and Pat Lennon, are members of the band Venice, which also includes their cousins Michael and Mark Lennon. The Lennon Sisters have frequented The Villages, the world&#x27;s largest retirement community, for shows. They last performed in The Villages on February 15, 2016.

<doc id="782875" wikidata="Q1130108" url="?curid=782875" title="Loudness (band)">
<text>is a Japanese heavy metal band formed in 1981 by guitarist Akira Takasaki and drummer Munetaka Higuchi. They were the first Japanese metal act signed to a major label in the United States. Loudness subsequently released twenty-six studio albums (five licensed in America) and nine live albums by 2014 and reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 during their heyday as well as charting on Oricon dozens of times. Despite numerous line-up changes in the band&#x27;s history, leaving Takasaki as the sole constant member, the band continued their activities throughout the 1990s, finally reuniting the original line-up in 2000. This incarnation released a further seven albums until November 30, 2008, when original drummer Munetaka Higuchi died from liver cancer at a hospital in Osaka at age 49. He was replaced by Masayuki Suzuki.

==Biography==

=== 1980–1984: From Lazy to Loudness ===
The band was formed by guitarist Akira Takasaki, bassist Hiroyuki Tanaka and drummer Munetaka Higuchi, coming off the split-up of the rock band Lazy in Tokyo in February 1980. The three musicians, Takasaki in particular, were dissatisfied with the musical direction of their previous band and wanted to test their abilities in new areas. The rising movement of new Japanese heavy metal acts (Bow Wow, Anthem, etc.) fit the aspirations and musical tendencies of the young musicians. Nevertheless, bassist Tanaka soon renounced to be part of the new metal group, searching success in the anime soundtrack business with the band Neverland. Takasaki recruited his childhood friend Masayoshi Yamashita as bass player and, after a few auditions, the band found a singer in former Earthshaker member Minoru Niihara. He was a university student at the time.

With this line-up, Loudness signed to the major record label Nippon Columbia and released their debut album, &quot;The Birthday Eve&quot;, in November 1981. Despite the reduced presence of the heavy metal genre in the Japanese media at the time and the lack of a single to launch the album, &quot;The Birthday Eve&quot; and the concerts to support it were quite successful. The flashy shred guitar work of Takasaki and the solid musicianship of the other band members soon became a trademark of their performances in the studio and on stage. The band, excited by the good sales response in Japan, produced four studio albums in rapid succession, while guitarist Takasaki found the time to start his solo career, releasing the album &quot;Tusk of Jaguar&quot;, which the other group members played in.

In 1983, after recording their third album &quot;The Law of Devil&#x27;s Land&quot;, they embarked on their first United States tour, followed by a tour in Europe. They moved to Europe to record their fourth album &quot;Disillusion&quot;, performing several concerts there, as documented in their second video &quot;Eurobounds&quot;. As an attempt to break in the international scene, the band re-recorded the vocal tracks of the album &quot;Disillusion&quot; in English language, releasing their first album outside Japan in 1984.

===1985–1991: American years===

Finally in 1985, through the management of Twisted Sister co-manager Joe Gerber, they signed an international record deal with Atco Records. Such an achievement was the first in Japanese music history for a heavy metal band. Their fifth album, the Max Norman-produced &quot;Thunder in the East&quot;, was recorded in the United States and was successful. It was their first American release and it peaked at No. 74 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, relying much on the strength of the single &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;, whose video earned some rotation play on MTV.

Their sixth album, &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, was once again produced by Max Norman and charted at No. 64, receiving very good reviews and making Loudness a worldwide attraction. The album was released in Japan in a different version, under the name &quot;Shadows of War&quot;. Their success in the United States had pushed the group to write more commercial pop-metal tunes, like the single &quot;Let It Go&quot;. Following this new and apparently chart-rewarding direction, the band lost some of their supportive Japanese fan base, which did not accept the homologation to the US glam metal sound.

Their seventh album &quot;Hurricane Eyes&quot; was released in 1987 worldwide with English lyrics. A Japanese version was subsequently released only in Japan later in the year with Niihara singing most of the lyrics in Japanese. The album was produced by the famous producer and sound engineer Eddie Kramer, who had worked with the likes of The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Kiss. The song &quot;So Lonely&quot;, a reworked version of &quot;Ares Lament&quot; from the 1984 album &quot;Disillusion&quot;, was instead produced by Andy Johns, another world-famous producer. This was the last Loudness album to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, where it remained for four weeks, peaking at No. 190.

Following the &quot;Jealousy&quot; EP in 1988, singer Niihara was pushed out of the band following producer Max Norman&#x27;s suggestion that an English speaking vocalist could help the band break through in the American market. The chosen American vocalist was former Obsession frontman Mike Vescera. Minoru Niihara continued his singing career in Japan as frontman of the metal bands Ded Chaplin, Sly and X.Y.Z.→A, besides releasing a solo album. The new Loudness line-up recorded two studio albums, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; in 1989 and &quot;On the Prowl&quot; in 1991. The latter included only three new songs among remakes of older material translated and sung by Vescera. Despite extensive tours and strong support from their label, the new albums did not improve the band&#x27;s status in America and, on the contrary, further diminished the Japanese fanbase of Loudness. After the release of the single &quot;Slap in the Face&quot;, Vescera left Loudness during their 1991 American tour, to join Yngwie J. Malmsteen&#x27;s band. He was replaced by former Ezo vocalist Masaki Yamada to finish the tour. The change of personnel did not influence the success of the band, because the sudden predilection of the American audience for the gritty and aggressive sound of grunge and alternative rock bands at the beginning of the 1990s, had already de facto put an end to the American adventure of Loudness, as well as to the careers of many other bands from the glam and heavy metal scenes.

===1992–1999: Back to the start===
Soon after their return to Japan, Yamashita also left the band and was replaced by former X bassist, Taiji Sawada. This line-up produced the self-titled album &quot;Loudness&quot; in 1992, which charted in Japan at No. 2, becoming their highest charting album in Japan, and the 1993 live album &quot;Once and for All&quot;. The sound and the music presented in those works is heavier and more aggressive than in the albums produced in America and marks the beginning of a new phase in the career of Akira Takasaki, main composer of the band.

In 1993, the band was again on the verge of falling apart, with the departure of both Higuchi, who went to play in Niihara’s Sly, and Sawada, who founded D.T.R. Takasaki remained the only founding member, with a band to reinvent. In this period he traveled to India and converted to Buddhism, and found the right motivations to not disband Loudness. He convinced Yamada to stay as singer and, with his help, recruited former Ezo drummer Hirotsugu Homma to the band. The trio produced in 1994 &quot;Heavy Metal Hippies&quot;, a transitional studio album, where Takasaki tried to mix the old Loudness sound with grunge and world music influences. To bring the band on tour, Takasaki completed the roster with Naoto Shibata, bassist and leader of the then disbanded Japanese heavy metal band Anthem. This new incarnation of Loudness released three other studio albums (&quot;Ghetto Machine&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Engine&quot;) and one live album (&quot;Loud &#x27;n&#x27; Raw&quot;) between 1994 and 1999. The sound of these releases is quite different from the band’s earlier works, with Takasaki’s compositions veering strongly towards groove metal with heavy psychedelic and ethnic influences. Homma’s double bass drum beat is another important difference from the earlier Loudness sound.
The band toured regularly in Asia and went to Europe, where they participated to the 1999 edition of the Dynamo Open Air Festival.

===2000–2008: Reunion===
In 2000, Yamada expressed his wish to quit Loudness and suggested a reunion with the original line-up to celebrate the band&#x27;s 20th Anniversary. Takasaki agreed with him and dismissed Homma and Shibata, asking at the same time Higuchi, Niihara and Yamashita to rejoin the band for the event. The original members of the band reunited in 2000, releasing the album &quot;Spiritual Canoe&quot; and conducting a reunion tour. Although intended to be a one-time event, the popularity of the band&#x27;s reunion in their native Japan was overwhelming and the band decided to continue recording and live activities. At least one studio album and one DVD release have followed every year since the 2000 reunion, in addition to one-off recordings, like 2005&#x27;s theme song for famed K-1 fighter Musashi (&quot;The Battleship Musashi&quot;).
In the new Loudness studio albums, the band tries again the fusion of different musical influences with the melodic metal sound of the band from the 1980s, adopting very different styles of composition. The result is often a rather heterogeneous collection of songs, going from classic heavy metal sound to speed metal, thrash metal and grunge, with ethnic and even hip hop influences. The band&#x27;s popularity remains very high in Japan, where they continued touring every year. Loudness even tried a new approach to the international market, with the reissue of the albums &quot;RockShocks&quot; and &quot;Racing&quot; in English language and an international tour that brought the band back to the US, as documented in the DVD &quot;Loudness in America &#x27;06&quot;.

Tragedy would strike in April 2008, just two months after releasing the album &quot;Metal Mad&quot;, Loudness went on hiatus when drummer Munetaka Higuchi was diagnosed with liver cancer. They played with Mötley Crüe in October 2008 at the Greater Tokyo Area&#x27;s Saitama Super Arena, with session drummer Kozo Suganuma filling in for Higuchi. On November 30, 2008, Munetaka died from his illness at a hospital in Osaka at age 49.

===2009–present: New drummer===

The band confirmed through Takasaki that, despite the recent loss of drummer Munetaka Higuchi, they would be recording a new studio album, &quot;The Everlasting&quot;, which was released in May 2009. The new material was based on drum tracks recorded by Higuchi before his death. Upon the album&#x27;s release, they introduced their new drummer in Masayuki Suzuki. The band went on tour in 2009, presenting only material from their first four albums and announced their following album, &quot;King of Pain&quot;, which was released in May 2010. Also in 2010, Loudness was featured at the Bang Your Head!!! festival in Germany and did a brief European tour. Loudness returned to America for their 30th Anniversary tour in May and June 2011.

In 2010 they recorded &quot;The Eternal Soldiers&quot; to be the theme song for &quot;Mazinkaiser SKL&quot;, which was released as a single later that year.

In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; and posted on YouTube on July 11, 2011, Akira Takasaki commented on &quot;King of Pain&quot;&#x27;s lack of solos and speed. He said that the reason for this was the band&#x27;s desire to introduce Masayuki Suzuki, their new drummer. Takasaki also stated that the next album&#x27;s playing would be &quot;much more speedy, much more aggressive&quot; than &quot;King of Pain&quot;. Loudness released &quot;Eve to Dawn&quot; on September 14, 2011.

Another album, &quot;2012&quot;, followed on August 22, 2012. Due to a scheduling conflict with Niihara&#x27;s side project X.Y.Z.→A, Michael Vescera was scheduled to perform as guest vocalist on April 14, 2013, at the Live N&#x27; Louder Festival in São Paulo, Brazil, which would mark the first time he has sung with the band in over 20 years. However, Vescera was unable to attend the event, and Hibria vocalist Iuri Sanson ended up filling in the vocalist spot.

The band released their 26th studio album, &quot;The Sun Will Rise Again&quot;, on June 4, 2014.

The group teamed up with Outrage to hold the first Loud∞Out Fest on May 2, 2015. The second installment was held on May 1, 2016, and also included Anthem and Lost Society in addition to the two namesake acts. The 2017 edition of the fest was called a &quot;tour&quot; and saw two concerts on May 4 and 6 that included Galneryus.

In January 2018, the band released their 27th studio album, &quot;Rise to Glory&quot;. However, in February, Suzuki was hospitalized with a mild stroke. The band tapped drummer Ryuichi Nishida to fulfill its touring obligation until Suzuki&#x27;s full recovery and return in September 2018. The end of 2021 brought a new record: &quot;Sunburst&quot;. The band pulled out of an announced European tour in early 2023. The band and tour promoter offered different accounts of the reason for the cancellation.

<text>Mouhijärvi is a former municipality of Finland, located in the southwestern part of the country. It was an agricultural village since the 18th century.

On 1 January in 2009 Mouhijärvi was consolidated with the municipalities of Vammala and Äetsä, to form a new town named [[Sastamala]].

==Geography==
Mouhijärvi was located in the southwest Pirkanmaa region, and was part of the former provinces of Turku and Pori Province (1917 to 1997) and Western Finland Province (1997 to 2010). The location is between the shores of Mätikkö and Siilijärvi lakes and covered an area of , of which was water.

==Demographics==
The municipality had a population of 2,961 (2003). The population density was 11.0 inhabitants per .

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

;History
Mouhijärvi was notable for being the first municipality in Finland to have an all-female city council — in 1988.

==Notable persons==
===Miss Universe===
Armi Kuusela, winner of Miss Finland in 1952 and the Miss Universe 1952 beauty contest was born, raised and lived in Muhos. Muhos county has a village named Kylmälänkylä, which is thought to be the longest village in Finland.

===Parliamentarians===
The members of the parliament elected from Muhos have been Pirkko Mattila (True Finns 2011-), Ester Häikiö (Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League 1951-1954) and Aaro Kauppi (Agrarian League 1951–1954, 1956–1958 and 1963–1966, renamed as Centre Party 1965-1966) and Yrjö Kesti (Small Farmers&#x27; Party of Finland 1930–1936). Juhana Petter Valkola was a peasant deputy during the diet session 1877–1878.

During the great depression of the 1930s Muhos was one of the municipalities where the &quot;deficiency movements&quot; (pulaliikkeet, singular &quot;pulaliike&quot;) started to organise as critique to the cabinet parties. After the municipal elections of the year 1933, the biggest political group in the municipal council of Muhos was &quot;Muhoksen pulatoimikunta&quot; which was an elemental part of the movement in the southern regions of Oulu. In 1933 they had seven members of the council. In the northern Finland as the &quot;deficit movement&quot; was based on the small peasants&#x27; and was a critique for the Agrarian League and Kyösti Kallio, but in some cases it was a critique to the Social Democratic Party of Finland as well. Some parts of the &quot;deficiency movement&quot; was financed moderately by the Communist Party of Finland as its activities were forbidden by law in (1930–1944) to the end of the continuation war. In the 1930s the Communistic movement of Finland tried to go on its work in the Social Democratic organisations, which were not banned in Finland and less also in the deficiency movement.

The &quot;deficiency movements&quot; demanded the state take more effective measures to help the small peasants to avoid the compulsory auctions of the debt-driven small farms. Many of the farmsteads were bought in the auctions by the state and later returned to their former owners.

<doc id="782890" wikidata="Q901154" url="?curid=782890" title="Semisynthesis">
<text>Semisynthesis, or partial chemical synthesis, is a type of chemical synthesis that uses chemical compounds isolated from natural sources (such as microbial cell cultures or plant material) as the starting materials to produce novel compounds with distinct chemical and medicinal properties. The novel compounds generally have a high molecular weight or a complex molecular structure, more so than those produced by total synthesis from simple starting materials. Semisynthesis is a means of preparing many medicines more cheaply than by total synthesis since fewer chemical steps are necessary.

[[Semisynthesis|Semisynthesis of [[paclitaxel]]]]. Installation of the necessary side chain and acetyl group of paclitaxel by a short series of steps, starting from isolated 10-deacetylbaccatine III.
Drugs derived from natural sources are commonly produced either by isolation from their natural source or, as described here, through semisynthesis of an isolated agent. From the perspective of chemical synthesis, living organisms act as highly efficient chemical factories, capable of producing structurally complex compounds through biosynthesis. In contrast, engineered chemical synthesis, although powerful, tends to be simpler and less chemically diverse than the complex biosynthetic pathways essential to life.

== Biological vs engineered pathways ==
Due to these differences, certain functional groups are easier to synthesize using engineered chemical methods, such as acetylation. However, biological pathways are often able to generate complex groups and structures with minimal economic input, making certain biosynthetic processes far more efficient than total synthesis for producing complex molecules. This efficiency drives the preference for natural sources in the preparation of certain compounds, especially when synthesizing them from simpler molecules would be cost-prohibitive.

== Applications ==
Plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria are all valuable sources of complex precursor molecules, with bioreactors representing an intersection of biological and engineered synthesis. In drug discovery, semisynthesis is employed to retain the medicinal properties of a natural compound while modifying other molecular characteristics—such as adverse effects or oral bioavailability—in just a few chemical steps. Semisynthesis contrasts with total synthesis, which constructs the target molecule entirely from inexpensive, low-molecular-weight precursors, often petrochemicals or minerals. While there is no strict boundary between total synthesis and semisynthesis, they differ primarily in the degree of engineered synthesis employed. Complex or fragile functional groups are often more cost-effective to extract directly from an organism than to prepare from simpler precursors, making semisynthesis the preferred approach for complex natural products.

== Notable examples in drug development ==
Practical applications of semisynthesis include the groundbreaking isolation of the antibiotic chlortetracycline and the subsequent semisynthesis of antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline. Other notable examples include the early commercial production of the anti-cancer agent paclitaxel from 10-deacetylbaccatin, isolated from &quot;Taxus baccata&quot; (European yew), the semisynthesis of LSD from ergotamine (derived from fungal cultures of ergot), and the preparation of the antimalarial drug artemether from the naturally occurring compound artemisinin. As synthetic chemistry advances, transformations that were previously too costly or difficult to achieve become more feasible, influencing the economic viability of semisynthetic routes.

One of Korsholm&#x27;s more notable landmarks is that it holds Finland&#x27;s longest bridge, the Replot Bridge. The bridge connects the island of Replot to the mainland. Finland&#x27;s second oldest stone bridge that is still in use, can also be found in Korsholm, in the village of Toby.

Major islands in the archipelago include Replot, Björkö, Köklot, Panike and the Valsörarna archipelago.

Along the coast, Korsholm extends to two river outlets: Kyrönjoki river flows into the Vassor bay of the Gulf of Bothnia, and the Laihianjoki river flows into Vanhankaupunginlahti, the bay on whose shore the city of Vaasa is located.

== History ==
=== Name ===
The original Finnish name &quot;Mustasaari&quot; &quot;Black Island&quot; may have been a medieval island cleared by a wildfire or an island that looks dark when approaching from the sea. Due to isostatic uplift, the area referred to is now inland. The parish is first mentioned as &quot;Mustasaari&quot; parish in 1348. In Swedish, the pronunciation developed into &quot;Mussor&quot;, although the form &quot;Mustasaari&quot; remained in use in the community. Mikael Agricola, the founder of written Finnish, spelled it &quot;Mustsåår&quot; in 1530. Olaus Magnus spelled it as &quot;Mostesar&quot; in his 1539 map, Carta Marina, where the castle appeared separately as &quot;Korsholm&quot;. In 1606–1611, it was known as &quot;Mussar&quot;, but in 1611 the city of Vaasa was founded in the parish and thus the parish was known as Vaasa. In 1772, it was known as &quot;city of Vaasa and Mustasaari annex&quot;, and in 1807–1867 &quot;parish of Vaasa and Mustasaari&quot;. Since then, Vaasa has been an independent parish. The municipality was named &quot;Korsholm&quot; in Swedish in 1927, after the medieval Korsholma castle.

===Middle Ages===
Korsholm has a history that can be dated back to 1348. In that year Korsholm was mentioned for the first time in writing in a royal letter concerning freedom of commerce. Therefore, the municipality celebrated its 650th anniversary in 1998. In the mid-14th century Saint Mary&#x27;s Church was built in Korsholm island. The whole of Ostrobothnia was governed for hundreds of years from Korsholma Castle (Chrysseborg). The ruins of Saint Mary&#x27;s Church and Korsholm Castle are now in the old town of Vaasa (; ).

===1973 merger===
Today&#x27;s Korsholm municipality consists of five smaller municipalities that were merged in 1973: Korsholm in the center, Replot and Björköby in the far archipelago, Solf in the southern plain and Kvevlax in the eastern plain. To reflect the new, larger municipality the motif in the Korsholm coat of arms is five intertwined golden threads on a red background.

== Demographics ==
The municipality has a population of and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Korsholm is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages. The Finnish speakers are concentrated near the enclosed city Vaasa, particularly in Smedsby, and in the villages of Toby and Kvevlax in the southern plain, while the rest of the municipality is Swedish-speaking.

In a 2016 statistical comparison of municipalities by Yle, Korsholm was rated 5/5 for viability and health and 4/5 for atmosphere (concerning e.g. education, crime and leisure), but only 2/5 for economy. Exceptionally good results were found in violent crime, which occurs at a rate of 1.9 per 1,000 inhabitants vs. the national average of 5.6, in the number of alcoholics and other addicts, at 0.6 per 1,000 inhabitants, vs. the national average of 3.3, and the proportion of youth smoking at 6.0%, vs the national average of 14.2%. Concerns were mainly economic: the employment self-sufficiency is only 57% vs. 89%, the equity ratio is poor (34.8% vs. 51.9%) and indebtedness is relatively high (70.4% vs. 48%), despite the municipal tax being the same as the national average (20.75%). Korsholm has relatively little industry and commuting to Vaasa is very common. Korsholm is neither losing nor gaining inhabitants by migration.

<text>Interculturalism is a political movement that supports cross-cultural dialogue and challenging self-segregation tendencies within cultures. Interculturalism involves moving beyond mere passive acceptance of multiple cultures existing in a society and instead promotes dialogue and interaction between cultures. Interculturalism is often used to describe the set of relations between indigenous and western ideals, grounded in values of mutual respect.

== Origin ==
Interculturalism has arisen in response to criticisms of existing policies of multiculturalism, such as criticisms that such policies had failed to create inclusion of different cultures within society, but instead have divided society by legitimizing segregated separate communities that have isolated themselves and accentuated their specificity. It is based on the recognition of both differences and similarities between cultures. It has addressed the risk of the creation of absolute relativism within postmodernity and in multiculturalism. Interculturalism has been used as a tool of Native American and indigenous rights activists to achieve rights and recognition.

== Definition ==
Philosopher Martha Nussbaum in her work &quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot;, describes interculturalism as involving &quot;the recognition of common human needs across cultures and of dissonance and critical dialogue within cultures&quot; and that interculturalists &quot;reject the claim of identity politics that only members of a particular group have the ability to understand the perspective of that group&quot;. Anthropologist Joanne Rappaport describes interculturalism as consisting of three main threads: a method of connection, a political philosophy aimed at creating utopian indigenous citizenship, and a challenge to traditional ethnography. Rappaport discusses the importance of interculturalism in the Colombian Indigenous movement for human rights and recognition.

== Usage ==
Interculturalism has been included in different national constitutions across Latin America, including Bolivia, Ecuador (2008), Brazil, and across Europe. Colombia includes the concept of multiculturalism and pluriethnic citizenship in its 1991 constitution. The Ecuadorian constitution has been described as in between both multiculturalism and interculturalism.

The United Nations&#x27; agency UNESCO adopted the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions in 2005, which declares support for interculturalism. In Germany, all universities are required to have a section on intercultural competence in their social work programs, that involves students being able to be open to listen and communicate with people of different cultural backgrounds, have knowledge of the backgrounds of cultural groups, knowledge of existing stereotypes and prejudices involving cultural groups, and other criteria. Salman Cheema, the Head of Marketing and Communications of the British Council, in an article titled &quot;From Multiculturalism to Interculturalism – A British perspective&quot;, spoke of an event co-hosted by the British Council and Canada&#x27;s Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 11, 2013, interculturalist advocate Phil Wood declared that multiculturalism has faced serious problems that need to be resolved through interculturalism, and rejected those opponents of multiculturalism who seek to restore a pre-multiculturalist monoculturalist society. Several days later in Montreal, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) declared support for interculturalism in the preamble of its constitution adopted its federal convention held in Montreal on April 14, 2013.

== Intercultural Health ==
Intercultural health applies the concepts of interculturalism to health settings. It involves conceptualizing health itself as part of a broader cultural framework. Intercultural health defines what counts as &quot;health&quot; as outside purely biomedicine. In many cases, intercultural health is an approach that seeks to reduce gaps between indigenous health and biomedical health systems. Indigenous health systems, sometimes grouped in with alternative medicine, often involve different kinds of healers, plant medicine techniques, holistic medicine, and indigenous knowledge that has been passed down through generations. Intercultural health systems often state the goal of creating better health outcomes in indigenous communities and generating mutual respect between biomedical practitioners and indigenous healers.

The implementation of intercultural health practices is associated with the project of decentralizing health systems, especially in Latin America. Ecuadorian epidemiologist and physician Jaime Breilh is a proponent of intercultural health for its benefits on population health. Structural violence, a term developed by American medical anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer, describes a lack of available health care as a form of violence. Supporters of intercultural health care models cite addressing structural violence as a goal. The goal of many intercultural health models is to treat indigenous knowledge with the same respect as biomedicine. Intercultural health models have been associated with improved health outcomes in indigenous communities.

Effective intercultural health projects involve buy-in from all cultures represented. Anthropologist Catherine Walsh describes the concept of &quot;critical interculturality.&quot; She defines this as using indigenous concepts to question the existing structure and advance epistemic change. This type of change requires what anthropologist Linda Tuhiwai Smith calls decolonizing methodologies, which call for a reconsideration of what counts as knowledge. There are examples of intercultural health projects that do not fully incorporate indigenous methodologies and instead continue to perpetuate the western hegemonic order.

Intercultural health projects often involve connecting traditional medicine, or ancestral medicine, or indigenous medicine, with western, biomedicine. A series of case studies highlight intercultural health projects that integrate biomedicine with traditional medicine, in Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Suriname, and Ghana. Intercultural health education is a priority at the medical school in the Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar in Quito, Ecuador. Intercultural education models have been built into schools in many indigenous communities across the Americas with the goal of passing down aspects of the particular indigenous practices and culture. These are often focused on language acquisition. Peru and Ecuador have both implemented intercultural indigenous language acquisition programs.

Intercultural health concepts applied in United States biomedical settings are often called cultural competency. The explanatory model, the original framework of cultural competency, was developed by Arthur Kleinman. It is a technique grounded in a set of questions that providers can use to understand how a patient understands their own illness. This model has been applied in many US medical schools. Intercultural health projects are seen as distinct from culturally competent ones because of their goal in achieving indigenous political rights and reframing knowledge bases to include indigenous concepts. One of the criticisms of the cultural competency model is that it can create biases among health providers, who might begin to treat patients differently because of their cultural background, without allowing for heterogeneity within a cultural group. It can also lead to worse health outcomes in minority groups when health care providers make assumptions about patients&#x27; health behaviors and histories based on their race, ethnicity, or culture. The concept of &quot;witnessing&quot; was developed by Ellen Davenport as a way to overcome cultural competency stereotyping.

== Reception ==
Interculturalism has both supporters and opponents amongst people who endorse multiculturalism. Gerald Delanty views interculturalism as capable of incorporating multiculturalism within it. Ali Rattansi, in his book &quot;Multiculturalism: A Very Short Introduction&quot; (2011) argues that Interculturalism offers a more fruitful way than conventional multiculturalism for different ethnic groups to co-exist in an atmosphere that encourages both better inter-ethnic understanding and civility; he provides useful examples of how interculturalist projects in the UK have shown in practice a constructive way forward for promoting multi-ethnic civility. Based on a considerable body of research, he also sets out the outlines of a new interpretation of global history which shows that concepts of tolerance are not restricted to the West, and that what is usually regarded as a unique Western cultural achievement should more appropriately be regarded as a Eurasian achievement. He thus offers a more interculturalist view of global history which undermines notions of &#x27;a clash of civilisations&#x27;.

In contrast, Nussbaum views interculturalism as distinct from multiculturalism and notes that several humanities professors have preferred interculturalism over multiculturalism because they view multiculturalism as being &quot;associated with relativism and identity politics&quot;.

The extent to which the principles of intercultural health are protected in practice under the Ecuadorian constitution are questioned by academics. Some argue that interculturalism creates a binary, whereas pluriculturalism is more inclusive alternative.
