<text>Bridge and Tunnel (often abbreviated B&amp;T or BNT) is a term – often used pejoratively – to describe people who live in communities surrounding the island of Manhattan in New York City, and commute to it for work or entertainment. It refers to the fact that vehicular travel to the island of Manhattan requires passing over a bridge or through a tunnel. Some use it to describe residents of the other four boroughs of New York City – Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island – but it typically refers to those who travel into the city from outside the area served by the New York City Subway (thus by car), including the Hudson Valley, New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island.

==Etymology==

Though the term originates from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, it has come to encompass all people who commute from outside of New York City proper, including Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey, and the Hudson Valley. The &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot; explains that a bridge-and-tunnel person is one who lives in the suburbs and is perceived as unsophisticated. However, this is sometimes also used as allusion to New York City&#x27;s vast transportation system.

===Origin===
The earliest known instance of this phrase in print is the December 13, 1977, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

==Comparisons==
&quot;Bridge and tunnel&quot; was later adopted in San Francisco in reference to party-goers who live outside San Francisco, as a reference to this original usage. Residents of the Peninsula and South Bay take commuter trains (Caltrain or BART, each of which has several tunnels) and freeways (I-280 and US 101, which do not) to visit city hot-spots but do not actually live in San Francisco. Residents from the East Bay typically drive or take a bus across the Bay Bridge (and Yerba Buena Tunnel) to reach San Francisco, or take BART through the Transbay Tube. The commute into San Francisco from Marin County also involves a bridge (the Golden Gate) and the Robin Williams Tunnel.

In Southern California, the term &quot;909er&quot; (a reference to area code 909) has come to have a similar, derogatory meaning for people coming from areas inland of Los Angeles, Orange County, and Riverside County, which historically had the 909 area code.

In Southern Ontario, the term &quot;905er&quot; (a reference to Area Code 905) has come to have a similar meaning for the suburb area surrounding Toronto-proper, including areas such as York Region, Pickering, and Oshawa.

<doc id="763946" wikidata="Q5320082" url="?curid=763946" title="Dámaso Blanco">
<text>Dámaso Blanco Caripe (born December 11, 1941 in Curiepe, Miranda State, Venezuela), is a former Major League Baseball third baseman/shortstop and right-handed batter who played for the San Francisco Giants (1972–74). In 1977, at the age of 36, he retired from baseball and began serving as a scout for the Cincinnati Reds for a short period of time. On his return to Venezuela, he began a successful career as commentator in the media.

==Life and career==
Blanco was the classic example of the fine fielder with a light bat. He was a decent hitter in the minors, where his batting and on-base averages were both quite respectable. He was 7-for-20 (.350) in 1972 (his first two hits coming in the same game, against Tom Phoebus of the Chicago Cubs on June 11), but was 0-for-15 in his last times at bat, 0-for-13 in limited opportunities the next two seasons.

In parts of three seasons as a backup with the Giants, Blanco hit .212 (7-for-33) with two runs batted in, nine runs, one double and 3 stolen bases in 72 games. In the field he handled 46 of 48 total chances successfully (.958) and participated in 3 double plays.

He resumed his career in the Venezuela League, hitting .268 (704-for-2623) with 198 RBI, 289 runs, 72 doubles, 28 triples, 0 home run and 70 steals in 754 games (1960–77).

After retiring at age 36, Blanco scouted briefly for the Cincinnati Reds before beginning a successful career as a journalist and baseball broadcaster in his native Venezuela.

In 2014, Blanco gained induction in the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He was inducted as well in the Hall in 2015, when the entire 1959 Pan American Games champion team was honored.

<doc id="763947" wikidata="Q335778" url="?curid=763947" title="Polling station">
<text>A polling place is where voters cast their ballots in elections. The phrase polling station is also used in American English and British English, although a polling place is the building and polling station is the specific room (or part of a room) where voters cast their votes. A polling place can contain one or more polling stations. In Australian English, &quot;polling place&quot; is used. Americans also use the term voting precinct in some states. 

Since elections generally take place over a one- or two-day span on a periodic basis, often annual or longer, polling places are usually located in facilities used for other purposes, such as schools, churches, sports halls, local government offices, or even private homes, and may each serve a similar number of people. The area may be known as a ward, precinct, polling district, or constituency. The polling place is staffed by officials (who may be called election judges, returning officers, or other titles) who monitor the voting procedures and assist voters with the election process. Scrutineers (or poll-watchers) are independent or partisan observers who attend the poll to ensure the impartiality of the process.

The facility will be open between specified hours depending on the type of election, and political activity by or on behalf of those standing in the ballot is usually prohibited within the venue and immediately surrounding area.

Inside the polling place will be an area (usually a voting booth) where the voter may select the candidate or party of their choice in secret. If a ballot paper is used, this will be placed into a ballot box in front of witnesses who cannot see for whom the vote has been cast. Voting machines may be employed instead.

Some polling places are temporary structures. A portable cabin may be specially sited for an election and removed afterwards.

There are five types of voting technologies that are currently being used in the United States polling locations. These comprise hand-counted paper ballots, mechanical lever machines, punch cards, optically readable paper ballots, and electronic voting machines. One of the reasons for a tendency toward witnessed final posting or transacting physical systems yet retaining the secret ballot is to reduce electoral fraud.

== Voting booth ==

A voting booth or polling booth (in British English) is a room or cabin in a polling station where voters are able to cast their vote in private to protect the secrecy of the ballot. Commonly the entrance to the voting booth is a retractable curtain. Usually access to the voting booth is restricted to a single person, with exceptions for voters requiring assistance. The booths aren&#x27;t in all states but some, as others use a form of mailing.

Voting machines generally use either a voting booth or some other form of privacy cover to obscure voters from the view of others.

==History==

The word &quot;poll&quot; means &quot;scalp&quot; or &quot;head&quot;. When votes were taken by gathering people together and counting heads, the place where this was done (sometimes an open field) was called the &quot;polls&quot;.

Polling places used to gather and count ballots in elections have changed significantly over the past 250 years. Advances in technology have played a major role in changing the polling places because as the type of ballot changed, the venue in which the ballots are counted also changed. One of the main reasons for advancement was to be able to access the results quicker. First was the word ballot, then came the different types of paper ballots, and in the late 20th Century electronic balloting systems were introduced.

Before there were paper ballots, people would simply call out their selection at the polling place. This polling place was typically the county courthouse or town hall. Sometimes these polls were taken outside of the venue in a more informal fashion. When the voters came to the town hall to announce their choice, they would get in line to see the judge and swear in. Voters would swear an oath to the judge on a Bible and be allowed to cast one ballot per election. The judge acted as the only form of voter identification and it was up to them to be able to identify individuals that had already voted and exclude them from voting again.

The use of paper and electronic ballots have been the most widely used form of capturing votes in recent history. When paper or electronic ballots are used, the polling place must be professionally organized in order to ensure that the ballots are not tampered with and are accounted for accurately. These polls are held inside a building that has been set up in stations to assist voters. When the voter arrives, they will be asked to show a form of voter identification (Photo ID is required in most European countries and in some US states). Properly identified votes would go to a voting booth where the votes are captured. After all votes were captured, voters could examine the voting ticket before submitting the ballot to the poll worker, in a ballot box, or on the computerized ballot.

==Polling location effects==
The building where the polling location is sited can have a significant effect on the results of the poll. Research shows that polling location may influence how a voter casts their ballot. This subtle unknown factor can be significant and can sway a close election. Individuals may be influenced to behave in a certain way based on environmental cues, i.e., an object or place that can influence a voter&#x27;s behavior; for example, the condition of the building, the name of the building, the ordinary use of the building, or the building decor. Researchers have spent much time considering what makes people vote the way they do; they have found that the smallest of changes can have large effects.

Waiting times at polling places have also been a problem in the US. This has become such a controversial topic that even President Obama in his State of the Union Address on 12 February 2013 mentioned the need to decrease waiting times. He went on to say that it is the duty of Americans to make sure that everyone has not only the right to vote but the opportunity to vote without having to wait several hours in line.

===Building usage===
The building used as the polling place has a significant effect on how an individual votes. For example, voting inside a school building, a citizen might be more likely to vote for those in favor of school systems and education. This is especially true if the school building you are voting in is in need of general improvement and/or renovation. This environmental cue may give a voter firsthand knowledge of what needs there may be in a particular setting. Similarly, voting in a church or parish hall, a citizen might be less likely to vote in favor of stem cell research. These cues give a person a sense of satisfaction for voting one way or another in the moment, regardless if that was the way they intended to vote in the first place.

===Distance to voting location===
The cost of voting influences whether or not a person will vote. Research shows that the more expensive voting gets, the less likely a person is to vote. Distance to the polling location is one of the main reasons cost can become an issue for voters. Minor changes in distance from voters&#x27; homes to polling place can change the turnout of voters, which may change the outcome of a close election. Distance to the polling place is an issue if not every voter has access to vehicle transportation. According to the research on distance to the polling location by Haspel and Knotts, &quot;To illustrate the range of the effect of distance, we plot our predicted probabilities at the lower and upper bounds of our continuous vehicle available variable. When no one owns a car (vehicle available = 0), the likelihood of voting drops from .664 at a distance of to .418 at the median distance of . When automobiles are universally available (vehicle available = 1), voters are much less sensitive to changes in distance: the likelihood of voting drops from .444 to .392 over the same distance range&quot;. Voters ultimately value the convenience of polling locations. If a poll is accessible to the citizen they will make an effort, if the citizen has to travel a long distance then voter turnout decreases dramatically&quot;.

===Redistricting===
If a voter changes precincts due to redistricting, then the chances of their continuing to vote in future elections decreases. The confusion that redistricting causes will deter the voter from looking into the new precinct where he or she should now vote. In addition, the informational costs associated with alerting voters of their new polling location will also affect the voter turnout because it is highly unlikely that funds will be available to allocate to ensure that every voter knows where to vote. Redistricting can be beneficial in order to provide a convenient location, but careful consideration should be taken before such a decision is made.

===Openness and centralisation===
If voters are allowed to vote at any of a number of different locations in the county or district etc., this will increase voter turnout. Sometimes, a voter&#x27;s most convenient voting location is near his or her workplace, not necessarily the closest to their residence. Having a more open policy of allowing multiple possible locations for a person to vote would encourage those individuals who cannot feasibly commute back and forth from work to vote, assuming the day of election is not a mandatory day off. Having a large conspicuous polling location will ensure that the voters know where they are supposed to vote. This will cut down on unnecessary signage and eliminate clutter and confusion.

==Alternatives==
===Remote voting===
====Australia====
In Australia, many voters in remote locations (such as many Indigenous communities) have their votes collected by &quot;remote mobile voting teams&quot; (RMVTs), which travel to remote communities via several forms of transport, generally in four-wheel-drives (4WDs), but also on light aircraft, helicopters and boats in many cases. For example, in the federal seat of Lingiari (the largest in size (but smallest in population) of the two federal electorates in the Northern Territory), where Indigenous people make up around 40% of the population, most people have their votes collected by RMVTs and thus there is low turnout on election day in Lingiari. In Lingiari, regular polling places are generally only found in major towns and cities, such as Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek. In contrast, in Solomon (the other federal seat in the Northern Territory, which includes Darwin and most of Palmerston), most voters vote at polling places due to their widespread availability. RMVTs are not exclusive to Lingiari or the Northern Territory, however; they are also used to a lesser extent in remote areas in the seats of Durack (Western Australia), Grey (South Australia), Kennedy (Queensland), Leichhardt (Queensland), O&#x27;Connor and Parkes (New South Wales).

RMVTs also operate for state and territory elections. In the Northern Territory, most people vote before election day, but those who do that live in remote electorates (i.e those outside Darwin, Palmerston and Alice Springs) have their vote collected by RMVTs, whereas those in urban electorates (i.e those in Darwin, Palmerston and Alice Springs) vote at regular polling places. In the seats of Daly, Katherine and Namatjira, the majority of voters vote at regular polling places but for those in the remote parts of the electorate, RMVTs do exist. In Queensland, RMVTs are used by some remote voters in the seat of Cook.

<doc id="763951" wikidata="Q1203659" url="?curid=763951" title="Simultaneous localization and mapping">
<text>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent&#x27;s location within it. While this initially appears to be a chicken or the egg problem, there are several algorithms known to solve it in, at least approximately, tractable time for certain environments. Popular approximate solution methods include the particle filter, extended Kalman filter, covariance intersection, and GraphSLAM. SLAM algorithms are based on concepts in computational geometry and computer vision, and are used in robot navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality.

SLAM algorithms are tailored to the available resources and are not aimed at perfection but at operational compliance. Published approaches are employed in self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, newer domestic robots and even inside the human body.

== Mathematical description of the problem ==
Given a series of controls formula_1 and sensor observations formula_2 over discrete time steps formula_3, the SLAM problem is to compute an estimate of the agent&#x27;s state formula_4 and a map of the environment formula_5. All quantities are usually probabilistic, so the objective is to compute

:formula_6

Applying Bayes&#x27; rule gives a framework for sequentially updating the location posteriors, given a map and a transition function formula_7,

:formula_8

Similarly the map can be updated sequentially by

:formula_9

Like many inference problems, the solutions to inferring the two variables together can be found, to a local optimum solution, by alternating updates of the two beliefs in a form of an expectation–maximization algorithm.

== Algorithms ==
Statistical techniques used to approximate the above equations include Kalman filters and particle filters (the algorithm behind Monte Carlo Localization). They provide an estimation of the posterior probability distribution for the pose of the robot and for the parameters of the map. Methods which conservatively approximate the above model using covariance intersection are able to avoid reliance on statistical independence assumptions to reduce algorithmic complexity for large-scale applications. Other approximation methods achieve improved computational efficiency by using simple bounded-region representations of uncertainty.

Set-membership techniques are mainly based on interval constraint propagation. 
They provide a set which encloses the pose of the robot and a set approximation of the map. Bundle adjustment, and more generally maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP), is another popular technique for SLAM using image data, which jointly estimates poses and landmark positions, increasing map fidelity, and is used in commercialized SLAM systems such as Google&#x27;s ARCore which replaces their prior augmented reality computing platform named Tango, formerly &quot;Project Tango&quot;. MAP estimators compute the most likely explanation of the robot poses and the map given the sensor data, rather than trying to estimate the entire posterior probability.

New SLAM algorithms remain an active research area, and are often driven by differing requirements and assumptions about the types of maps, sensors and models as detailed below. Many SLAM systems can be viewed as combinations of choices from each of these aspects.

=== Mapping ===
Topological maps are a method of environment representation which capture the connectivity (i.e., topology) of the environment rather than creating a geometrically accurate map. Topological SLAM approaches have been used to enforce global consistency in metric SLAM algorithms.

In contrast, grid maps use arrays (typically square or hexagonal) of discretized cells to represent a topological world, and make inferences about which cells are occupied. Typically the cells are assumed to be statistically independent to simplify computation. Under such assumption, formula_10 are set to 1 if the new map&#x27;s cells are consistent with the observation formula_2 at location formula_4 and 0 if inconsistent.

Modern self driving cars mostly simplify the mapping problem to almost nothing, by making extensive use of highly detailed map data collected in advance. This can include map annotations to the level of marking locations of individual white line segments and curbs on the road. Location-tagged visual data such as Google&#x27;s StreetView may also be used as part of maps. Essentially such systems simplify the SLAM problem to a simpler localization only task, perhaps allowing for moving objects such as cars and people only to be updated in the map at runtime.

=== Sensing ===
SLAM will always use several different types of sensors, and the powers and limits of various sensor types have been a major driver of new algorithms. Statistical independence is the mandatory requirement to cope with metric bias and with noise in measurements. Different types of sensors give rise to different SLAM algorithms which assumptions are most appropriate to the sensors. At one extreme, laser scans or visual features provide details of many points within an area, sometimes rendering SLAM inference unnecessary because shapes in these point clouds can be easily and unambiguously aligned at each step via image registration. At the opposite extreme, tactile sensors are extremely sparse as they contain only information about points very close to the agent, so they require strong prior models to compensate in purely tactile SLAM. Most practical SLAM tasks fall somewhere between these visual and tactile extremes.

Sensor models divide broadly into landmark-based and raw-data approaches. Landmarks are uniquely identifiable objects in the world which location can be estimated by a sensor, such as Wi-Fi access points or radio beacons. Raw-data approaches make no assumption that landmarks can be identified, and instead model formula_13 directly as a function of the location.

Optical sensors may be one-dimensional (single beam) or 2D- (sweeping) laser rangefinders, 3D high definition light detection and ranging (lidar), 3D flash lidar, 2D or 3D sonar sensors, and one or more 2D cameras. Since the invention of local features, such as SIFT, there has been intense research into visual SLAM (VSLAM) using primarily visual (camera) sensors, because of the increasing ubiquity of cameras such as those in mobile devices. 
Follow up research includes. Both visual and lidar sensors are informative enough to allow for landmark extraction in many cases. Other recent forms of SLAM include tactile SLAM (sensing by local touch only), radar SLAM, acoustic SLAM, and Wi-Fi-SLAM (sensing by strengths of nearby Wi-Fi access points). Recent approaches apply quasi-optical wireless ranging for multi-lateration (real-time locating system (RTLS)) or multi-angulation in conjunction with SLAM as a tribute to erratic wireless measures. A kind of SLAM for human pedestrians uses a shoe mounted inertial measurement unit as the main sensor and relies on the fact that pedestrians are able to avoid walls to automatically build floor plans of buildings by an indoor positioning system.

For some outdoor applications, the need for SLAM has been almost entirely removed due to high precision differential GPS sensors. From a SLAM perspective, these may be viewed as location sensors which likelihoods are so sharp that they completely dominate the inference. However, GPS sensors may occasionally decline or go down entirely, e.g. during times of military conflict, which are of particular interest to some robotics applications.

=== Kinematics modeling ===
The formula_7 term represents the kinematics of the model, which usually include information about action commands given to a robot. As a part of the model, the kinematics of the robot is included, to improve estimates of sensing under conditions of inherent and ambient noise. The dynamic model balances the contributions from various sensors, various partial error models and finally comprises in a sharp virtual depiction as a map with the location and heading of the robot as some cloud of probability. Mapping is the final depicting of such model, the map is either such depiction or the abstract term for the model.

For 2D robots, the kinematics are usually given by a mixture of rotation and &quot;move forward&quot; commands, which are implemented with additional motor noise. Unfortunately the distribution formed by independent noise in angular and linear directions is non-Gaussian, but is often approximated by a Gaussian. An alternative approach is to ignore the kinematic term and read odometry data from robot wheels after each command—such data may then be treated as one of the sensors rather than as kinematics.

=== Moving objects ===
Non-static environments, such as those containing other vehicles or pedestrians, continue to present research challenges. SLAM with DATMO is a model which tracks moving objects in a similar way to the agent itself.

=== Loop closure ===
Loop closure is the problem of recognizing a previously-visited location and updating beliefs accordingly. This can be a problem because model or algorithm errors can assign low priors to the location. Typical loop closure methods apply a second algorithm to compute some type of sensor measure similarity, and reset the location priors when a match is detected. For example, this can be done by storing and comparing bag of words vectors of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features from each previously visited location.

=== Exploration ===
&quot;Active SLAM&quot; studies the combined problem of SLAM with deciding where to move next to build the map as efficiently as possible. The need for active exploration is especially pronounced in sparse sensing regimes such as tactile SLAM. Active SLAM is generally performed by approximating the entropy of the map under hypothetical actions. &quot;Multi agent SLAM&quot; extends this problem to the case of multiple robots coordinating themselves to explore optimally.

=== Biological inspiration ===
In neuroscience, the hippocampus appears to be involved in SLAM-like computations, giving rise to place cells, and has formed the basis for bio-inspired SLAM systems such as RatSLAM.

=== Collaborative SLAM ===
&quot;Collaborative SLAM&quot; combines sensors from multiple robots or users to generate 3D maps. This capability was demonstrated by a number of teams in the 2021 DARPA Subterranean Challenge.

== Specialized SLAM methods ==

=== Acoustic SLAM ===
An extension of the common SLAM problem has been applied to the acoustic domain, where environments are represented by the three-dimensional (3D) position of sound sources, termed aSLAM (Acoustic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Early implementations of this technique have used direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimates of the sound source location, and rely on principal techniques of sound localization to determine source locations. An observer, or robot must be equipped with a microphone array to enable use of Acoustic SLAM, so that DoA features are properly estimated. Acoustic SLAM has paved foundations for further studies in acoustic scene mapping, and can play an important role in human-robot interaction through speech. To map multiple, and occasionally intermittent sound sources, an acoustic SLAM system uses foundations in random finite set theory to handle the varying presence of acoustic landmarks. However, the nature of acoustically derived features leaves Acoustic SLAM susceptible to problems of reverberation, inactivity, and noise within an environment.

=== Audiovisual SLAM ===
Originally designed for human–robot interaction, Audio-Visual SLAM is a framework that provides the fusion of landmark features obtained from both the acoustic and visual modalities within an environment. Human interaction is characterized by features perceived in not only the visual modality, but the acoustic modality as well; as such, SLAM algorithms for human-centered robots and machines must account for both sets of features. An Audio-Visual framework estimates and maps positions of human landmarks through use of visual features like human pose, and audio features like human speech, and fuses the beliefs for a more robust map of the environment. For applications in mobile robotics (ex. drones, service robots), it is valuable to use low-power, lightweight equipment such as monocular cameras, or microelectronic microphone arrays. Audio-Visual SLAM can also allow for complimentary function of such sensors, by compensating the narrow field-of-view, feature occlusions, and optical degradations common to lightweight visual sensors with the full field-of-view, and unobstructed feature representations inherent to audio sensors. The susceptibility of audio sensors to reverberation, sound source inactivity, and noise can also be accordingly compensated through fusion of landmark beliefs from the visual modality. Complimentary function between the audio and visual modalities in an environment can prove valuable for the creation of robotics and machines that fully interact with human speech and human movement.

== Implementation methods ==

Various SLAM algorithms are implemented in the open-source software Robot Operating System (ROS) libraries, often used together with the Point Cloud Library for 3D maps or visual features from OpenCV.

=== EKF SLAM ===
In robotics, &quot;EKF SLAM&quot; is a class of algorithms which uses the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for SLAM. Typically, EKF SLAM algorithms are feature based, and use the maximum likelihood algorithm for data association. In the 1990s and 2000s, EKF SLAM had been the de facto method for SLAM, until the introduction of FastSLAM.

Associated with the EKF is the gaussian noise assumption, which significantly impairs EKF SLAM&#x27;s ability to deal with uncertainty. With greater amount of uncertainty in the posterior, the linearization in the EKF fails.

=== GraphSLAM ===
In robotics, GraphSLAM is a SLAM algorithm which uses sparse information matrices produced by generating a factor graph of observation interdependencies (two observations are related if they contain data about the same landmark). It is based on optimization algorithms.

== History ==
A seminal work in SLAM is the research of Smith and Cheeseman on the representation and estimation of spatial uncertainty in 1986. Other pioneering work in this field was conducted by the research group of Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte in the early 1990s. which showed that solutions to SLAM exist in the infinite data limit. This finding motivates the search for algorithms which are computationally tractable and approximate the solution. The acronym SLAM was coined within the paper, &quot;Localization of Autonomous Guided Vehicles&quot; which first appeared in ISR in 1995.

The self-driving STANLEY and JUNIOR cars, led by Sebastian Thrun, won the DARPA Grand Challenge and came second in the DARPA Urban Challenge in the 2000s, and included SLAM systems, bringing SLAM to worldwide attention. Mass-market SLAM implementations can now be found in consumer robot vacuum cleaners and virtual reality headsets such as the Meta Quest 2 and PICO 4 for markerless inside-out tracking.

<text>Rula Lenska (born Roza Maria Leopoldyna Lubienski 30 September 1947) is a Polish actress. She mainly appears in British stage and television productions and is known in the United States for a series of television advertisements in the 1970s and 1980s. She is known for the films &quot;Queen Kong&quot; and &quot;Aura&quot;, and she portrayed Claudia Colby in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Lenska was married to the actors Brian Deacon (1977–1987) and Dennis Waterman (1987–1998). Both marriages ended in divorce.

==Early life==
Lenska was born in England in the village of Diddington, near St Neots, Huntingdonshire, in a Polish resettlement camp that had previously been the EVAC American Military Hospital. Her birth was registered in nearby St Neots. Her family is Polish nobility, bearing the Pomian coat of arms, and before the war owned a castle and estate in Kazimierza Wielka, Poland. Her father, Major Ludwik Łubieński, was personal secretary to Józef Beck, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Poland before the German occupation of the country. Later, he became adjutant to General Sikorski, Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile and was chief of the Polish military mission in Gibraltar during World War II. During the Cold War he headed the CIA-funded Polish Section of Radio Free Europe in Germany. 

Her mother was Countess Elżbieta Tyszkiewicz, who escaped from Poland to Italy during the German occupation, but was captured with her own mother and sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp, where they survived for two years. Lenska has two sisters: Anna, an actress who appeared in films in the late-1950s and early-1960s, and Gabriela. Lenska was educated at the Ursuline Convent School in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent.

==Early career==
Lenska&#x27;s big break was as the &quot;Little Ladies&quot; band member &quot;Q&quot; in the British TV series &quot;Rock Follies&quot; (1976) and its sequel, &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77,&quot; the following year. By this time, she had &quot;discarded&quot; her title as a Polish countess; she has said of the decision, &quot;In England it doesn&#x27;t &quot;count,&quot; if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Lenska began to appear in commercials for the hair product Alberto VO5, which were shown on US television. Though she was known in Britain, she was almost unknown in the United States, yet the commercials were scripted as if Lenska was an established celebrity. In a &quot;Tonight Show&quot; monologue broadcast after the commercials started running, Johnny Carson asked &quot;Who the hell is Rula Lenska?&quot; and began using her name as a running joke on his show. Around the same time, Jane Curtin played Lenska in a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The ribbing culminated with a sketch on the short-lived 1980 variety program &quot;The Big Show&quot;, where Steve Allen dressed in drag to parody her as “Rula Shiksa&quot; making a commercial by a swimming pool, and Lenska, making her first U.S. appearance, came onto the set to confront him. Allen was not told about her presence; it was a prank arranged by the show&#x27;s producer Nick Vanoff, who kept her hidden during the entire rehearsal and filming, so he was legitimately shocked when she approached him. She delivered a punchline, “I’m Rula Lenska and you’re not!” and then pushed him into the pool.

==Television==
Lenska has appeared in the television series &quot;Special Branch&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;The Detectives&quot;, &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;, &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;, &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, &quot;Doctors&quot;, and &quot;EastEnders&quot;, in which she played Frank Butcher&#x27;s girlfriend, Krystle, in a 2002 Costa del Sol special. In the 1970s, Lenska made it to the final five actresses short-listed for the role of companion Jo Grant in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and she later appeared in the serial &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;. She played Mrs. Peacock in series 2 of &quot;Cluedo&quot;. She also starred with John Inman in the short-lived series &quot;Take a Letter, Mr. Jones&quot; (six episodes, 1981), with Lenska as an executive and Inman as her secretary. She was also featured in the BBC serial &quot;Private Schulz&quot; broadcast in the same year. 

In 1982 Lenska also appeared as a storyteller in five episodes of the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, narrating traditional Polish folk tales. Lenska also starred in the black comedy &quot;Paradise Grove&quot; (2003). In 2009, Lenska joined the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as new character Claudia Colby, an old friend of Audrey Roberts. In May 2011, Lenska left the role to join the &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; tour in August 2011. In 2016, she appeared in a Christmas special episode of the comedy &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;. She reprised her role in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in July 2018, before leaving the show again in April 2020. Lenska returned as Claudia for Norris Cole&#x27;s funeral in September 2021, and returned again in August 2022.

==Film==
Lenska&#x27;s film roles have included &quot;Soft Beds, Hard Battles&quot; (1974), &quot;Confessions of a Pop Performer&quot; (1975), &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975), &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1975), &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1976), &quot;The Deadly Females&quot; (1976), and &quot;Queen Kong&quot; (1976) as Luce Habit. In the film &quot;Gypo&quot; (2005), which was the first UK feature film to be made under Dogme rules, she played a Romani refugee from the Czech Republic living on a caravan site in Margate. She starred in the independent British film &quot;Jack Says&quot; (2008), opposite her one-time &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Mike Reid. That same year she lent her voice to the animation film &quot;Agent Crush&quot;.

==Stage==
Lenska has toured widely, both in the British Isles and overseas, and has appeared in several West End shows, including &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot;, and also in many pantomimes. She is a regular performer (and part of the original cast) of the touring play &quot;Seven Deadly Sins Four Deadly Sinners&quot;.

In December 2005, she appeared on stage with the London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus for their Christmas Show, &quot;Make the Yuletide Gay&quot;. She sang and danced while also hosting the show at Symphony Hall in Birmingham, the Dome Concert Hall in Brighton and the Barbican Centre in London.

At the equivalent show in December 2006, Sandi Toksvig corrupted the lyrics of a song to suggest Lenska had a Christmas job in Debenhams. In 2007, she toured alongside Marti Webb and Sheila Ferguson in a new musical about menopause called &quot;Hot Flush&quot;. and hosted a mini-show at Lutterworth Piano Rooms 3 November 2012.

==Radio and voice==
On radio Lenska played Lintilla and her clones in the second series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and was also in the fifth series which debuted on BBC Radio 4 in May 2005. She has presented travel programmes for BBC Radio and has recorded various audiobooks including &quot;Peaches For Monsieur Le Cure&quot; by Joanne Harris.

==&quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;==

Lenska&#x27;s work on tour with the London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus is assumed to have prompted her participation in the United Kingdom version of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in January 2006. Her reason for accepting the invitation to go on the show was &quot;I&#x27;m a crazy Polish countess who likes a challenge&quot;. During the show, she declared that she had been a &quot;Tibetan Buddhist&quot; for many years but had been practising Nichiren Daishonin for two years.

On 13 January 2006, along with fellow housemate, Scottish politician and then-Respect Party MP George Galloway, she attracted the attention of the media by indulging in a role-play task set by &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, in which Galloway pretended to be a cat licking milk from her cupped hands, and Lenska stroked his ears and moustache. On another occasion during her time in the Big Brother house, she was accidentally locked in the toilet.

==Personal life==
Lenska has been married twice, first to actor Brian Deacon (4 June 1977 – 1987), with whom she had one daughter, Lara Parker (née Lara Deacon), and secondly, to actor Dennis Waterman, from 3 January 1987 until 31 March 1998. Both marriages ended in divorce. She and Waterman met on the set of &quot;Minder&quot; in 1981 where their characters had a brief love interest. Some years after Lenska&#x27;s second marriage ended, in a March 2012 interview with Piers Morgan, Waterman said: &quot;It&#x27;s not difficult for a woman to make a man hit her. She certainly wasn&#x27;t a beaten wife, she was hit and that’s different.&quot; Via her friend, Denise Welch on &quot;Loose Women&quot;, Lenska said that she was relieved that he had now admitted beating her. Lenska had made allegations against Waterman shortly after their split and thought she could no longer be accused of lying.

In 2016, Lenska was sentenced to a 16-month driving ban and ordered to pay a total of £526 after crashing her car while under the influence of alcohol. Her three-year-old grandson was a passenger in the car.

<doc id="763958" wikidata="Q224807" url="?curid=763958" title="Jules Verne Trophy">
<text>The Jules Verne Trophy is a prize for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by any type of yacht with no restrictions on the size of the crew provided the vessel has registered with the organization and paid an entry fee. A vessel holding the Jules Verne trophy will not necessarily hold the absolute round the world record. The trophy was first awarded to the first yacht which sailed around the world in less than 80 days. The name of the award is a reference to the Jules Verne novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; in which Phileas Fogg traverses the planet (albeit by railroad and steamboat) in 80 days. The current holder is &quot;IDEC Sport&quot; skippered by Francis Joyon in 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes 30 seconds in 2017.

==Route==

*The Jules Verne Trophy&#x27;s starting point is defined by an imaginary line between the Créac&#x27;h lighthouse on Ouessant (Ushant) Island, France, and the Lizard Lighthouse, UK. The boats have to circumnavigate the world leaving the capes of Good Hope, Leeuwin, and Horn to port and cross the starting line in the opposite direction.
*The starting line is open as of the official ratification of the trophy&#x27;s rules by the World Sailing Speed Record Council.

==Rules==
The Jules Verne Trophy is awarded to the challenger who breaks the previous Jules Verne record of the round the world voyage under sail. The winner holds the trophy until such time as his/her record has been bettered. The boats must solely be propelled by natural forces of the wind and of the crew, but the trophy is open to any type of boat with no restrictions. Crew size is not restricted either. The circumnavigation must be completed non-stop and with no physical outside assistance, although on-shore weather routing is allowed. The challengers must respect certain safety rules.

==History==
The original idea for this competition has been attributed to Yves Le Cornec in 1985. The rules were defined in 1990. A committee was put in place to guarantee respect of the rules and fairplay. This committee included Peter Blake, Florence Arthaud, Jean-François Coste, Yvon Fauconnier, Gabrie Guilly, Robin Knox-Johnston, Titouan Lamazou, Yves Le Cornec, Bruno Peyron, Olivier de Kersauson, and Didier Ragot.

While the current holder of the trophy, Francis Joyon, also holds the around the world sailing record, this has not always been the case. In 2004 Steve Fossett broke the world record with the catamaran &quot;Cheyenne&quot; but was not awarded the trophy. According to reports, the trophy organizers requested a higher entrance fee from Fossett than from the other competitors, the difference which he refused to pay (€30,000 upfront versus €11,000 &amp; only needed to pay if they won the trophy). The winner of the trophy that year was Olivier de Kersauson on &quot;Geronimo&quot;, with a time which was five days slower than Fossett&#x27;s world record.

=== Summary of intermediate records ===
The best passage times are shared between 4 boats:
* &quot; Banque Populaire V &quot;, designed in 2006, launched in 2008 and renamed &quot;Maxi Spindrift 2&quot; in 2013
* &quot; Groupama 3 &quot;, designed in 2004, launched in 2006 and renamed &quot; IDEC sport &quot; in 2015
* &quot; Macif &quot;, designed in 2013, launched in 2015 and since then mainly singlehanded by François Gabart
* &quot; :fr:Maxi Edmond de Rothschild &quot; designed in 2014, launched in 2017

Adding the record times of the various intermediate routes, gives a total record round the world in 36 days 22 hours and 36 minutes, or 4 days better than the record established in 2017 by Francis Joyon on &quot; IDEC sport &quot;.

===2016 record===
Francis Joyon took possession of the former &quot;Groupama 3&quot; on October 2, 2015, after three weeks of work at Multiplast, in Vannes. He chose an intermediate configuration between the initial power and a reduced rigging for solo races. Closer to the lightness and ergonomics sought alone, less versatile in particular in light winds, Joyon&#x27;s choices paid off during his two passages in the southern seas at the end of 2015 and again at the end of 2016, earning him numerous records. With a crew reduced to six people, &quot; IDEC Sport &quot; was ready to attempt the Jules-Verne Trophy, held since 2011 by Loïck Peyron with a time of 45 days, 13 hours, 42 minutes and 53 seconds.

After an attempt in November 2016 met with unfavorable weather in the doldrums and the South Atlantic, and a shock that slightly damaged her fin, Joyon set out again on December 16, 2016 to conquer the trophy. He arrived on January 26, 2017 with a new around the world sailing record of 40 days 23 h 30 min 30 s.
During their 2016 attempt for the Jules-Verne Trophy, Francis Joyon and his crew broke numerous intermediate records: four have been formalized and are the subject of records duly certified by the WSSRC.

They made quick crossings of the southern seas starting with the Indian Ocean, covering 8091,73 miles in 10 days (an average of 809 miles per day). This episode began ahead of the front of a depression which moved at a speed corresponding to the boat&#x27;s potential from South America to the Pacific Ocean. During 12 days, the wind remained port tack, blowing constantly at over 30 knots, an ideal configuration for speed records. Top speeds varied between 38 and 44 knots. Due to bad seas, their speed dropped temporarily (29 knots or per day) but soon climbed back above daily.

After passing New Zealand and the Antimeridian, sailing port tack 205 degrees longitude (25 degrees West to Antimeridian) in the southern seas, the crew jibed in the transition between two depressions, and managed to catch up with the weather system in front of them over the Pacific Ocean, setting off again at more than 30 knots daily average towards Cape Horn.

Joyon rounded Cape Horn, 16 days after hitting the first left South America, after a course of nearly above 30 knots average (730, 16 miles per day over 16 days). He then signs a performance increase of 30 to 40% compared to Loïck Peyron&#x27;s record 5 years earlier. Leaving the southern seas with a lead of 4 days 6 hours 35 min over Peyron&#x27;s previous record, Joyon and his crew regained on the record during this stretch.

The weather conditions allowed them to optimize their course, covering on the ground, at an average of 26.85 knots, for a theoretical course of . &quot;Banque Populaire V&quot;, the previous recordholder, had to cover almost 2600 more miles (29,002 miles).

===Distance records broken during the 2016 campaign===
While the best day of Loïck Peyron&#x27;s previous record was the only day above 800 miles from his record (811 miles over 24 hours, or 33.79 knots average), Francis Joyon maintains a speed above 800 daily miles for 10 consecutive days.

It thus improves a large number of progress records by a sailboat over a given period:

===Other records broken during the 2016 campaign===
*Boat record and the second longest distance covered by a sailboat in 24 hours with 894 miles.
*6 consecutive days at an average of 850.7 miles / 24 h (35.45 knots)

*Cape Leeuwin – Cape Horn in 9 d 08 h 46 min (12 d 22 h 22 min or 38% more for Loïck Peyron&#x27;s previous record)
*Cape of Good Hope – Cape Horn in 13 d 20 h 13 min (19 d 00 h 31 min or 37% more for Loïck Peyron&#x27;s previous record)

=== Notable performances ===
During her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2011–2012, the Banque Populaire V skippered by Loïck Peyron covered 811.70 nautical miles in 24 hours on 3 December 2011 at 11:45 UT, posting 28 days over 600 miles, including 9 days over 700 miles and 1 day over 800 miles.

During her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2009–2010, the trimaran Groupama 3 skippered by Franck Cammas covered 798 nautical miles in 24 hours on 13 February 2010 at 5 p.m. UT, showing 17 days over 600 miles, including 10 days over 700 miles.

During her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2016–2017, the trimaran Idec sport skippered by Francis Joyon covered 894 nautical miles in 24 hours, and 10 consecutive days at 809 miles / 24 h. Francis Joyon rounds Cape Horn, 16 days after riding off of South America, and after a course of nearly 12,000 miles above an average of 30 knots (730.16 miles / 24 h over 16 days). He then signs a performance increase of between 30 and 40% compared to the record to be broken by Loïck Peyron 5 years earlier. Leaving the southern seas with a lead of 4 j 06 h 35 min over Loïck Peyron&#x27;s previous record, Francis Joyon and his crew regained the equivalent of 2,800 miles on the record during this episode.

During the aborted attempt of 2019, Yann Guichard sets a new record crossing the equator in 4 days 19 h 57 min and, thanks to favorable weather conditions, lines up 4,812.1 miles from the 11th to 16th day, or 802 miles / day for 6 consecutive days.

During his record around the world Singlehanded in 2017, 24 hour distance record for François Gabart on Macif: 850,68 miles in 24h.

During his attempt for the Jules Verne Trophy on December 5, 2020, Thomas Coville on :fr:Sodebo Ultim 3 covered 889.9 miles in 24 hours (37.1 knots average, top speed 48.9 knots).

During his attempt for the Jules Verne Trophy on December 21, 2024, François Gabart on SVR-Lazartigue covered 892.2 miles in 24 hours (37.2 knots average, top speed over 50 knots).

==The trophy==
The &quot;Trophy Jules Verne&quot; was the subject of a public order of the visual arts delegation with the American artist Tom Shannon and is patroned by the French Ministry of Culture.

The work is a floating hull on a magnetic field, much as an anchorage for a ship. All dimensions have rigorous symbolic meaning. The midship beam of the hull corresponds to the diameter of the Earth, the ray of each end is proportional to that of the moon and the radius of the curvature of the frames is that of the sun. The competitors of the Trophy Jules Verne race around the Earth against time, with only the sun and the moon as companions and time keepers.

The sculpture is placed on a cast aluminium base, on which the names of the sailors having won the Trophy are engraved. The Musée national de la Marine in Paris hosts and maintains the Trophy. Each winner receives a miniature of the Trophy, magnetized like the original one.

When a record is broken, an official ceremony is held for the previous record holders to hand over the trophy to the new record holders, who are given the hull and must place it in its magnetic field mooring.

<text>The Salmonberry River is a tributary of the Nehalem River, about long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a remote unpopulated area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range in the Tillamook State Forest about west-northwest of Portland. The river runs through part of the region devastated between 1933 and 1951 by a series of wildfires known as the Tillamook Burn.

It rises in northeastern Tillamook County, near its border with Washington County, and flows west-northwest through the mountains, joining the Nehalem from the southeast about northeast of the city of Nehalem.

The river&#x27;s name comes from the salmonberry plant, &quot;Rubus spectabilis&quot;.

==Railroad==
An excursion railway and dinner train, the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad (OCSR), travels up the Nehalem River canyon from Wheeler to the mouth of the Salmonberry. The train to the Salmonberry is part of an excursion-train network operated by the OCSR, a non-profit organization run by volunteers, on track formerly used by the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad. The railway track continues up the Salmonberry for , but flooding and erosion damaged it so severely that it was closed in 2007.

The Wild Salmon Center and other conservation groups concerned about salmon and steelhead runs on the Nehalem and the Salmonberry prefer that the track along the Salmonberry remain closed. Of particular concern are landslides and herbicide spraying along the railway tracks in the river&#x27;s riparian zones. Both kinds of incursion can harm fish and incubating fish eggs.

<doc id="763967" wikidata="Q5375179" url="?curid=763967" title="Enalaprilat">
<text>Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of enalapril. It is the first dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitor and was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The thiol functional group of captopril was replaced with a carboxylic acid group, but additional modifications were required to achieve a potency similar to captopril.

Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own. The consequence of the structural modifications was that its ionisation characteristics do not allow for sufficient GI absorption. Thus, enalaprilat was only suitable for intravenous administration. This was overcome by the monoesterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril.

As a prodrug, enalapril is hydrolyzed &quot;in vivo&quot; to the active form enalaprilat by various esterases. Peak plasma enalaprilat concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours after oral enalapril administration. Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug from tissue distribution sites.

The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug accumulation on repeated administration but is thought to be of pharmacological significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment [particularly creatinine clearance &lt;20 mL/min (&lt;1.2 L/h)] results in significant accumulation of enalaprilat and necessitates dosage reduction. Accumulation is probably the cause of reduced elimination in healthy elderly individuals and in patients with concomitant diabetes, hypertension and heart failure.

<doc id="763968" wikidata="Q213462" url="?curid=763968" title="Piave (river)">
<text>The Piave (; ; ) is a river in Northeast Italy. It begins in the Alps and flows southeast for into the Adriatic Sea near the city of Venice. One of its tributaries is the Boite.

In 1809 it was the scene of a battle during the Napoleonic Wars, in which Franco-Italian and Austrian forces clashed. 
In 1918, during World War I, it was the scene of Battle of the Piave River, the last major Austro-Hungarian attack on the Italian Front, which failed. The Battle of the Piave River was a decisive battle of World War I on the Italian Front. In Italy the river is thus called &quot;Fiume Sacro alla Patria&quot; (Sacred River of the Homeland) and is mentioned in the patriotic song &quot;La leggenda del Piave&quot;. It was eventually followed by the Battle of Vittorio Veneto later that year.

==Viticulture==
North of the city of Venice along the Piave Valley is the &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) zone that makes up the Veneto wine region known as the Piave DOC. Here both red and white wine are produced, mostly as varietal wines, with Merlot being the dominant grape of the region. Among the other grapes grown in the region are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc (which can be made separately or together as a wine labelled &quot;Cabernet&quot;), Pinot blanc, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero, Raboso, Friulano, Verduzzo Trevigiano and Verduzzo Friulano (which can be made separately or together as a wine labelled &quot;Verduzzo&quot;).

For wines to qualify for DOC labelling the stated variety, they must make up at least 95% of the blend from grapes that are harvested within a maximum yield restriction—11 tonnes/hectare for the Cabernets, Verduzzos and Friulano varieties, 12 tonnes/ha for the Pinots, 13 tonnes/ha for Merlot and 14 tonnes/ha for Raboso. The finished wines also must meet a minimum alcohol level—11.5% for all varieties except Merlot and Friulano which only need to reach 11% alcohol by volume. A separate &quot;riserva&quot; bottling for the red wine varieties is permitted provided the wine is aged at least two years prior to release and attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 12.5%.

<doc id="763973" wikidata="Q7539595" url="?curid=763973" title="Sleazenation">
<text>Sleazenation was a monthly London based fashion, lifestyle and “&#x27;post-drug culture&#x27; magazine according to founding editor Steve Beale in 1999&quot;. The publication was co-founded by Jon Swinstead and Adam Dewhurst and published by Swinstead Publishing. It was given away for free to clubbers for one and a half years until its launch in 1996 as a high street magazine. It featured bands and artists ranging from underground acts such as Genesis P-Orridge to pop acts such as New Order. 

&quot;Founded as a free London club listings guide, it went on to enjoy an eight year reign as the world’s most anarchic, unpredictable fashion title, as likely to run a six-page feature on gout as it was a Gucci gatefold,&quot; wrote Jack Mills in a nostalgic 2015 &quot;Wonderland&quot; magazine feature. Supermodel Agyness Dean named &quot;Sleazenation&quot; as her teenage favourite in a 2010 &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; appearance. Absolute Radio DJ and podcaster Dave Berry is also a vocal modern-day fan. 

Like &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;Sleazenation&quot; is associated with the hipster regeneration of London&#x27;s east end in the late 1990s. Writing about the magazine&#x27;s influence in &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; during November 2021, reporter Harriet Shepherd observed, &quot;looking back at it now Sleaze Nation is a historic record of the gentrification that has characterised London&#x27;s cultural fabric—reported, almost unknowingly, in real-time.&quot; The early of home of many writers, designers, photographers and artists who would go on to achieve success, Sleaze Nation has also been celebrated in its modern-day contemporaries &quot;Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Show Studio&quot;. &quot;Back then, the style media was a way into journalism for young talent from outside London. It was feasible then, but that door has totally closed. Who can just move into Hoxton Square on spec now?&quot; founding editor Steve Beale told &quot;The Guardian&quot; during a 2015 article on east London TV pastiche Nathan Barley.

==Editorial and Photography==
The founding 1996 editor was 22 year-old Steve Beale, who left in 1999 to work at EMAP on The Face and Arena after editorial director Ashley Heath read his article on The Sekhmet Hypothesis. The magazine&#x27;s obscure title was taken from a tongue-in-cheek club night Beale threw at university. The magazine was an early champion of influential photographers including Ewen Spencer, Alasdair Mclellan, Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin, and Jonathan de Villiers, particularly through the black and white, documentary-style photography of nightlife accompanying the famously outspoken club listings guide. Beale employed future urban art dealer Steve Lazarides as picture editor, where he would meet Banksy who soon also worked sporadically from the office, also producing covers and illustrations for the magazine. The artist Alexander de Cadenet was the Arts Editor from 1997-1999 and featured a series of interviews with significant visual artists of the time. 

Subsequent editors were Stuart Turnbull, Steve Slocombe, and Neil Boorman. The magazine struggled to match the energy of its 90s heyday and closed at the end of 2003. It was relaunched shortly afterwards as &quot;Sleaze&quot; magazine. 

During its tenure Sleazenation worked with a number of well-known art directors such as Stephen Male (who helped mould the face of i-D magazine in the 1980s), Nick Booth, Guerilla 6, Patrick Duffy and Richard Hart although it is Scott King&#x27;s time at the magazine which helped solidify the magazine in many people&#x27;s minds. During his tenure the magazine adopted the slogan, &quot;An ideal for living through fashion, art, music and design&quot;.

Scott King&#x27;s &quot;Cher Guevara&quot; cover from the February 2001 issue won several magazine awards and was featured in the Barbican exhibition &#x27;Communicate: Independent British Graphic Design since the Sixties&#x27;. He also contributed cover headlines such as &quot;Now even more superficial/Over 100 pages of hype &amp; lies&quot; and &quot;Absolute sell out&quot;. Other artists included Banksy who contributed to the July issue of 2000.&lt;br&gt;
The re-invigorated &#x27;Sleaze&#x27; came under the art direction of Richard Hart but only lasted 4 issues before being closed down. The former editor Neil Boorman and former music editor Stuart Turnbull went on to run free London bi-monthly magazine &#x27;Good for Nothing&#x27; which ran for 8 issues before closing around the end of 2005.

Sleazenation had an attendant picture library, PYMCA (Photographic Youth Music &amp; Culture Archive). This was overseen by Steve Lazarides, who would go on to manage Banksy.

Sleazenation was featured in Print! Tearing it Up at Somerset House, London in 2018.

<text>Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, formerly Fawcett Stadium, is a football stadium and entertainment complex in Canton, Ohio. It is a major component of &quot;Hall of Fame Village&quot;, located adjacent to the grounds of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The venue hosts the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game and serves as the home field for the football teams from Canton McKinley High School. It also served as the home field for Malone University from 1993 to 2018 and Walsh University from 1998 to 2022. It also served as the home stadium for a number of other Canton-area high schools.

The stadium was constructed as a replacement for League Field, the city&#x27;s previous stadium, where Canton&#x27;s professional football team, the Bulldogs, played many of their games. First dedicated as Fawcett Stadium in 1938, the stadium&#x27;s original name honored the memory of John A. Fawcett, a former Canton board of education member, who died several years before the stadium was completed.

On November 24, 2014, it was announced that Tom Benson, owner of the New Orleans Saints, would be donating to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, of which was to go into renovating Fawcett Stadium and recouping the money by renting use of the stadium. In response to Benson&#x27;s donation, the Hall of Fame announced that Fawcett Stadium would be renamed Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, which was dedicated on August 3, 2017. Benson died less than a year later, on March 15, 2018.

The renovation of Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium was part of the approximately $200 million construction completed in Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village expansion project.

==Construction==
The stadium was built from 1937 to 1939 at an estimated cost of $500,000. The federal government paid for $400,000 in the form of WPA manpower, while a school board bond issue paid for the materials. The stadium originally seated 15,000 and was the largest high school stadium in the country at that time.

On the grounds of the facility was a park, aptly named &quot;Stadium Park&quot;. This park still exists, although it is now much more disconnected from the stadium, as part of it was used for the site of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the rest of the park is separated from Tom Benson Stadium by Interstate 77.

==History==
Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium seats 23,000 and has an NFL-caliber press box.

Five Canton area high schools have played their football seasons on this field (McKinley Bulldogs, Lincoln Lions, Lehman Polar Bears, GlenOak Golden Eagles, and Canton Timken Trojans). Future Cleveland Browns great and Pro Football Hall of Famer Marion Motley, who along with fellow Hall of Famer Bill Willis broke the color barrier in modern professional football with the Cleveland Browns in 1946, scored the first touchdown in the stadium in 1938. Each summer, it hosts the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, the first contest of the National Football League (NFL) exhibition season.

Malone University also previously utilized the stadium as their home field for football until the program was discontinued after the 2018 season.

It is presently the home field for the McKinley Senior High School. The Ohio High School Athletic Association football state championship games were split between Fawcett Stadium and nearby Paul Brown Tiger Stadium in Massillon between 1991 and 2014, and all football state championship games have been played at the stadium since 2017.

In 1997, the stadium underwent a major renovation and a name change. Backed by the Canton community, $4.3 million worth of improvements were completed on the stadium. Some of the major improvements included state-of-the-art Astroturf with a player friendly rubber base, new locker room facilities, new scoreboard with graphics display screen, new lighting, new sound system, new electrical services, structural repairs, vinyl caps for all wooden seats, and a renovated press box. The newly renovated facility was also renamed to include the words Pro Football Hall of Fame Field.

From 1997 to 2000, Benson Stadium was the home of the Victory Bowl, the NCCAA championship football game. In 2002, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; rated Benson Stadium the number one high school football venue in America.

In 2009, the stadium hosted the inaugural IFAF Junior World Championship of American Football. The tournament gathered 16 best national teams from around the world. It hosted the 2015 IFAF World Championship in 2015.

On February 24, 2021, the Women&#x27;s Football Alliance announced a multi-year deal to host its championship weekend at the Stadium.

On August 29, 2021, the stadium was the site of a high school football game between Bishop Sycamore and IMG Academy, in which IMG Academy defeated Bishop Sycamore, 58–0. Following the game, the existence of Bishop Sycamore was questioned by fans and the school is accused of running a grift and duping ESPN into airing the game. Bishop Sycamore head coach Roy Johnson was fired following the game and an arrest warrant was issued towards him.

The stadium was planned to be the site of the Stagg Bowl in 2020 and 2021, hosted by the Ohio Athletic Conference. The 2020 edition was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 edition was played on December 17, 2021.

The United States Football League played its inaugural 2022 postseason at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium because of scheduling conflicts with the 2022 World Games at Legion Field and Protective Stadium. Semifinal games were played on June 25, while the championship game was played on July 3. On January 25, 2023, it was announced that the Pittsburgh Maulers and the New Jersey Generals would be playing their home games at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. The 2023 USFL North Division playoff game and the USFL Championship Game will also be played in that stadium. Canton was the only host stadium not retained when the USFL merged with the XFL to form the United Football League, as both the Maulers and Generals were contracted and the UFL scheduled all of its games in their teams&#x27; nominal home cities; Hall of Fame Village officials made an aggressive effort to land the 2024 UFL Championship Game but lost out to The Dome at America&#x27;s Center.

==Championship games hosted==

==2015–16 reconstruction==
After the 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame game concluded, demolition began on the stadium. The construction limited fan seating during the fall football season. The final phase of construction was scheduled to begin after the 2016 Hall of Fame Game. However, approximately an hour prior to kickoff, the game was cancelled due to poor field conditions caused by the use of improper paints applied to the field to create the Hall of Fame logo and other on-field graphics.

<text>Johann Christian Josef Abs (26 August 1781 in Wipperfürth – 15 April 1823 in Königsberg) was a German teacher.

In the year 1799 Abs gave his vow in the Franciscan monastery of Hamm and adopted the name of Theodosius. In 1806 he became head of the claustral school of Halberstadt. In this school, he accepted children without considering their ages, confessions, classes and sex. He often recruited his assistants among his pupils. His teachings included Bible studies, health and a tutorial in measurement. With the time, his method of teaching approached more and more that of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

In 1810 Abs left the claustral school and announced the creation of a &quot;boarding school for boys and girls&quot;. One year later, he published a tract on his adaptation of the teaching methods of Pestalozzi. In the feeling that a woman&#x27;s care is beneficial for his pupils, he quit the priesthood in 1813, adopted the Evangelic confession and married a former assistant of his.

According to the eighth annual report of his institution, the school consisted of a care station for orphaned children, a preparation school for children who are not yet ready for their first lessons, an education school for children whose parents were unable to care for them themselves and finally a public school open for everyone who wishes to use his common sense.

In 1815 Abs became head of the regional orphanage and combined it with his elementary school and a teacher seminary. Foreign governments sent young men to him to learn his methods of teaching. In 1818 he followed a call to Königsberg where he became director of the royal orphanage. He successfully held this position until his death in 1823.

<doc id="763984" wikidata="Q577947" url="?curid=763984" title="Ballot box">
<text>A ballot box is a temporarily sealed container, usually a square box though sometimes a tamper resistant bag, with a narrow slot in the top sufficient to accept a ballot paper in an election but which prevents anyone from accessing the votes cast until the close of the voting period. A ballot drop box allows voters who have received a ballot by mail to submit it for counting in a self-service fashion. In the United States, ballot boxes are usually sealed after the end of polling, and transported to vote-counting centers.

==History==
In the Roman Republic, each voter initially gave his vote orally to an official who made a note of it on an official tablet, but later in the Republic, the secret ballot was introduced, and the voter recorded his vote with a stylus on a wax-covered boxwood tablet, then dropped the completed ballot in the &quot;sitella&quot; or &quot;urna&quot; (voting urn), sometimes also called &quot;cista&quot;. Paper ballots were used in Rome to some extent as early as 139 BCE.

In ancient India in the 10th century Cholla era, in Tamil Nadu, palm leaves and pots were used to elect representatives to village administrations through the &quot;Kudavolai&quot; system. The candidates&#x27; names were written on palm leaves, and these were placed inside a pot. Winners were chosen through the drawing of random ballots. While this system may have been used before the 10th century, there is no direct historical evidence as of 2024.

In ancient Greece, voting was done by dropping small balls or tokens into ballot boxes to select preferred candidates. This method was also used in modern historical secret societies, which used white balls to vote someone into the organization, and black balls to keep them out, the origin of the word &quot;blackball&quot;. As of 2022, citizens of Gambia voted by dropping marbles in colored drums, marked with the photo and logo of selected candidates. This system was introduced in 1965 to address illiteracy in voting.

The first British secret ballot using ballot papers and a ballot box was held in Pontefract on 15 August 1872, under the terms of the recently enacted Ballot Act 1872. In a ministerial by-election following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Hugh Childers was re-elected as MP for Pontefract. The original ballot box, sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is held at Pontefract Museum.

The first paper ballots and ballot boxes in the United States began appearing in the early 19th century, replacing previous voice voting practices. However, these were not popularized until the 1850s, upon the use of the Australian Secret Ballot, a paper with each candidate&#x27;s name pre-marked. This system was used in the United States until reforms were passed in the 1880s. Voting was mostly by Australian Secret Ballot until automatic mechanical voting machines, operated with levers, became ubiquitous in the 20th century (1910-1980). Punch card voting and optical scanning machines (similar to ScanTron), both of which require paper ballots and therefore ballot boxes, came to market around the 1960s. Currently, the most popular way to vote in the United States is through optical scanning machines.

In the United States, ballot drop boxes have been in use since about 2000. Ballot drop boxes became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

==Operation==
While ballot boxes, other than drop boxes, are usually located in polling stations, mobile ballot boxes also exist. These are taken to people&#x27;s homes in some countries so that they do not have to travel to the polling station. Mobile ballot boxes are very popular in Eastern Europe, in which 90% of countries have provisions for their use, but are very limited in use in Western Europe. They are also only used in a small fraction of countries in Africa and the Americas.

When very large ballot papers are used, there may be a feeder mechanism to assist in the deposit of the paper into the box.

==Security==
Drop boxes allow voters to avoid having to use the mail service, and are generally more secure than mail boxes. In the 2010s, jurisdictions in the western United States, where voting by mail is commonplace, adopted secure ballot drop boxes capable of withstanding a range of risks, such as theft, vehicle collisions, arson, and inclement weather. One vendor manufactures a ballot box made of steel, weighing from . Fire suppression systems may rely on fuse-triggered chemical agents or airtight designs that smother fires. Some jurisdictions require ballot drop boxes to contain such systems. In the event that a drop box&#x27;s contents are damaged, authorities can identify affected voters by serial numbers and reissue ballots to them.

Polling stations may use transparent ballot boxes in order for people to be able to witness that the box is empty prior to the start of the election, and not stuffed with fraudulent votes. This style of ballot boxes (specifically, glass ballot boxes) had become a staple in the United States by 1860, in the context of scandals around the use of false bottoms on election boxes. It fell out of use in the United States around the turn of the century, in favor of new voting machines users operated by turning a crank. They are still in use occasionally in other countries, including France.

<text>Orbitz.com is a travel fare aggregator website and travel metasearch engine. The website is owned by Orbitz Worldwide, Inc., a subsidiary of Expedia Group. It is headquartered in the Citigroup Center, Chicago, Illinois.

==Background==
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.

Orbitz was the airline industry&#x27;s response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2, some claimed meaning &quot;Travelocity Terminator&quot;, but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.

==Antitrust concerns==
Before, during, and two years after launching the site, the company faced antitrust criticism since its creators controlled 75% of U.S. air travel. The United States Department of Transportation saw no antitrust issues with the launch of the Orbitz website. The United States Department of Justice ruled in 2003 that Orbitz was not a cartel and that there was no evidence of price fixing.

Nielsen&#x27;s Net rating division that the launch of the Orbitz website in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever to that date.

==Ownership history==
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering. The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.

On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.

In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver&#x27;s Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.

Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.

In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.6 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.

==Technologies==
Orbitz ran on a mixed Red Hat Linux and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems&#x27; Jini platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment, along with various other proprietary and open source software. Orbitz licenses ITA Software&#x27;s Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex event processing infrastructure as Open Source.

==Controversies==
===Southwest Airlines===
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset, claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.

===WebLoyalty===
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers&#x27; credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a &quot;scam&quot;. The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers&#x27; credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz claims to have ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer, and further claims not to share consumer credit card information with third parties &quot;any more&quot;.

===&quot;Milgram v. Orbitz&quot;===
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in &quot;Milgram v. Orbitz&quot; granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.

===American Airlines===
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system. AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers. American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules. The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.

===Media Matters&#x27; &quot;War on Fox&quot;===
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters&#x27; efforts as a &quot;smear campaign&quot;, but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to &quot;review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed&quot;.

===Skiplagged lawsuit===
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a federal lawsuit against 22-year-old Skiplagged founder Aktarer Zaman. The complaint alleges that Zaman &quot;intentionally and maliciously&quot; interfered with airline industry business relationships &quot;by promoting prohibited forms of travel&quot; which violate the common carrier contract with passengers. The complaint is centered on airline policies against hidden city tickets. Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal, the complaint alleged that Zaman&#x27;s website is disruptive to their business. The lawsuit was dismissed.

<text>Port Allen Airport is a regional airport of the State of Hawai&#x27;i. It is located southwest of the unincorporated town of Hanapepe on the south shore of the island of Kauai. Most flights to Port Allen Airport originate from commuter airports on the other Hawaiian islands by unscheduled air taxis and general aviation.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a general aviation facility.

==History==
The 1928 the Territorial legislature allotted $15,000 to establish an airport on Kauai, and purchased land at its present site. The first flight from Port Allen Airport, by Inter-Island Airways, was in November 1929.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Access to the airport is provided by Kaalani Road, which connects the airport with Lolokai Road and Highway 50. Adjacent to the airport are the salt ponds at Hanapepe where paakai is prepared. The principal planned improvements are the development of helicopter lease lots to the eastern end of the airport, construction of public comfort stations and minor roadway improvements.

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, the airport had 5,535 aircraft operations, an average of 15 per day: 59% air taxi, 40% general aviation, and 1% military. At that time there were 10 aircraft based at this airport: 40% helicopter, 10% glider and 50% ultralight.

== Authority ==
Port Allen Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Port Allen Airport is the Governor of Hawaii. The governor appoints the Director of the Hawai&#x27;i State Department of Transportation who has jurisdiction over the Hawaii Airports Administrator.

The Hawai&#x27;i Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office, Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawai&#x27;i: Hawai&#x27;i District, Kauai District, Mau&#x27;i District and the principal O&#x27;ahu District. Port Allen Airport is a subordinate of the Kauai District officials.

In 1990, Down played the role Stephanie Rogers in the CBS drama series &quot;Dallas&quot;. During 1997–99, she played Olivia Richards in the NBC soap opera &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. From April 2003 to February 2012, she portrayed Jackie Marone in the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Down was born on 17 March 1954 and brought up in Wandsworth, London, England. She began acting and modelling, and in her teenage years won several beauty pageants. She was voted Britain&#x27;s most beautiful teenager at the age of 15. Down left school at 15 and came to America for the first time at 17. In 1969, she made her feature film debut in a supporting role in the British drama sexploitation film &quot;The Smashing Bird I Used to Know&quot;. 
===1970s===
In 1971, Down guest-starred in the British television series &quot;Six Dates with Barker&quot;, &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, and &quot;Public Eye&quot;. Also that year, she starred in three movies: first was &quot;Countess Dracula&quot;, a horror film based on some of the legends surrounding the Countess Elizabeth Báthory playing the role of Elisabeth&#x27;s daughter. She starred in the thriller film &quot;Assault&quot; playing the role of schoolgirl who was raped on her way home from school. She also had a supporting role in the 20th Century Fox&#x27;s drama film &quot;All the Right Noises&quot;. In 1972, Down starred in the historical drama film &quot;Pope Joan&quot; opposite Liv Ullmann and Olivia de Havilland. In 1973, she appeared in the Western film &quot;Scalawag&quot; starring and directed by Kirk Douglas.

In 1973, Down was cast as Georgina Worsley in the Emmy Award-winning British period drama series, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. She made her debut in the episode &quot;Goodwill to All Men&quot; in December 1973. In 1974, she appeared in the anthology horror film &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; and the following year had supporting role in the action thriller &quot;Brannigan&quot;. Her television appearances includes &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;. Her fame led to a nude photoshoot for the magazine &quot;Mayfair&quot; in 1975. &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was her career breakthrough; after the show ended in 1975, she moved to Hollywood and began her film career.

In 1976, Down starred in the comedy film &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; opposite Peter Sellers. The film was released by United Artists, received positive reviews from critics and grossed $75 million worldwide. The following year she starred in the musical comedy film &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; starring opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 1973 musical of the same name. The film received mostly negative reviews. In 1978, Down played the leading role of burlesque artist Phyllis Dixey in the BAFTA Award-nominated made-for-television drama film, &quot;The One and Only Phyllis Dixey&quot;. She appeared in the romantic drama film &quot;The Betsy&quot; and played the female lead opposite Sean Connery in the heist comedy film &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;. The latter received positive reviews from critics and Downs&#x27; performance was noted by Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Sutherland, as the none-too-bright locksmith, and Miss Down, who must appear in several figuratively transparent disguises, have fun with what are, in effect, character roles. The three work together beautifully.&quot; In 1979, Down starred opposite Harrison Ford in the romantic war drama film &quot;Hanover Street&quot;, it received mixed-to-positive reviews and was considered a box-office failure.

===1980s===
In 1980, she starred opposite Burt Reynolds in the crime comedy film &quot;Rough Cut&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Lesley-Anne Down often looks as ravishing as Ava Gardner in her prime. The heady sensation created when her generous lips expand into a brilliant smile is an incidental pleasure well worth overindulging, but it would be even better if she had a role that permitted her more relaxation and confidence (and a costumer and hairdresser who consistently enhanced her beauty). The heroine&#x27;s dialogue seems to have been contrived under the influence of vague recollections of Grace Kelly in &quot;To Catch a Thief.&quot; The role affects an hauteur that doesn&#x27;t become Lesley-Anne Down somehow. It also appears to tax her acting technique, which isn&#x27;t nearly as sleek as Kelly&#x27;s. I suspect that the very idea of presenting her as a bitchy-elegant society girl inhibits Down rather more than it flatters her. There are moments when she seems to stiffen up as severely as Kim Novak at her least secure.&quot; In 1981, Down went to star in the adventure film &quot;Sphinx&quot; directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and based on the 1979 novel of the same name by Robin Cook. Down played Egyptologist researching a paper about the chief architect to Pharaoh Seti in the movie. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The performers are terrible, none more so than Mr. Langella, who is supposed to be mysterious and romantic but behaves with all of the charm of a room clerk at the Nile Hilton. Miss Down spends a good deal of her time going, &quot;Eeeeeeek!&quot; and is frequently hysterical - Egyptian room service being especially maddening. At her best, she reminds one of Jacqueline Bisset, but unlike Miss Bisset, who has survived many movies like this with her identity intact, Miss Down seems to dissolve as the film lurches on. By the end, I was sure she was Jacqueline Bisset.&quot; 

After &quot;Sphinx&quot;, Down returned to television playing British socialite Unity Mitford in an episode of anthology series &quot;BBC2 Playhouse&quot;. The following year she starred in Agatha Christie&#x27; &quot;Murder Is Easy&quot; and played the role of Esméralda in an American production of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; opposite Anthony Hopkins. In 1984, Down again starred with Anthony Hopkins, this time in the romantic war drama &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; based on the novel &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque. Later that year, she appeared in the ABC miniseries, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. She also appeared onstage in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and a musical version of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

In 1985, Down starred as Madeline Fabray LaMotte in the ABC miniseries, &quot;North and South&quot; based on the 1980s trilogy of novels &quot;North and South&quot; by John Jakes. The following year the sequel miniseries was released. The 1985 first installment, &quot;North and South&quot;, remains the seventh-highest rated miniseries in TV history. For her performance she received positive reviews and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television in 1986. During the filming of the miniseries, Down&#x27;s divorce from film director William Friedkin received wide press coverage. Allegations of adultery, drug use and violence accompanied Down and Friedkin&#x27;s acrimonious battle for full custody of their son in the divorce proceedings. In 1986, she returned to big screen starring alongside Pierce Brosnan in the horror film &quot;Nomads&quot; written and directed by John McTiernan. In 1988 she starred in the made-for-television remake of the 1958 romantic comedy &quot;Indiscreet&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said: &quot;The vapidity of both [lead] performances is magnified by come-hither camera shots that linger too long on their empty faces... Down has a little more flounce to the ounce, but the best she can do as a woman deceived is to fly into a deep snit. Production values evoke the silky-bland noblesse oblige that has been canonized for TV by &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing&quot;.&quot; Also that year, Down starred alongside Marilu Henner and Susan Blakely in the crime television film &quot;Ladykillers&quot; and later appeared in &quot;Night Walk&quot; (1989).

===1990s===
In 1990, Down was cast as a series regular for a limited run in the CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; as Stephanie Rogers. She earned a quarter of a million dollars&#x27; salary for a 10-week shoot. She starred in the unsuccessful television comedy pilot &quot;1775&quot; (1992) set in colonial Philadelphia during the run-up to the American Revolution. She guest-starred on the CBS series &quot;The Nanny&quot; and &quot;&quot;. She returned to cinema starring in the thriller film &quot;Over the Line&quot;. Down later starred in the smaller-scale films &quot;Night Trap&quot; (1993), &quot;Munchie Strikes Back&quot; (1994) &quot;In the Heat of Passion II: Unfaithful&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Secret Agent Club&quot; (1996). In 1994 she returned to her role as Madeline Fabray LaMotte in the ABC miniseries, &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell: North &amp; South, Book III&quot;. 
The final part received mostly mixed-to-negative reception, but her appearance was noted by &quot;Variety&quot;. Also in 1994, Down starred opposite Charles Bronson in the action thriller film &quot;Death Wish V: The Face of Death&quot;, the fifth and final installment in the &quot;Death Wish&quot; film series. &quot;Death Wish V&quot; was universally panned and holds a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 5 critics. The following year she appeared in his made-for-television movie &quot;Family of Cops&quot;. In 1996, she appeared in the sword and sorcery television film &quot;Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus&quot;, a sequel to the 1982 film &quot;The Beastmaster&quot;.

In 1996, Aaron Spelling cast her as Olivia Richards on his new daytime soap opera, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. Her character was the mix of Sue Ellen Ewing and Alexis Colby of the 1980s prime time soaps. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Chief among the large cast is Lesley-Anne Down, irresistible as a hooked-on-vodka matron who may or may not have murdered her lover.&quot; In 1997, for her portrayal of Olivia, Down won the award for &quot;Best Actress&quot; at the Soap Opera Update Awards. The series aired on NBC from January 1997 to December 1999. During the series, Down also appeared in the Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot; (1997), and starred in the &quot;Young Hearts Unlimited&quot; (1998), a made-for-television family comedy film directed by third husband, Don E. FauntLeRoy.

===2000s—present===
After the cancellation of &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, Down appeared in films &quot;The King&#x27;s Guard&quot; (2000), &quot;The Meeksville Ghost&quot; (2001) and &quot;13th Child&quot; (2002). She starred in two Lifetime movies: &quot;The Perfect Wife&quot; (2001) and &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (2002) based on Mary Higgins Clark&#x27;s novel. In 2001, she guest-starred as Lady Sheraton in the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; appearing in five episodes. She had cameo appearances in Don E. FauntLeRoy-directed action films &quot;Today You Die&quot; (2005) and &quot;Mercenary for Justice&quot; (2006), both starred Steven Seagal. Down wrote screenplay and starred in the 2006 comedy-drama film &quot;Seven Days of Grace&quot;. Filming began on March 17, 1996, 10 years before the eventual 2006 release of the film. The film was finally released to theaters on April 1, 2006. In 2003, Down was cast in another soap playing the role of Jackie Marone on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; on CBS. She first appeared on April 1, 2003. In January 2012, Down confirmed that she would be departing the programme. Her final appearance was on February 29, 2012.

In 2011, Down appeared in the thriller film &quot;Rosewood Lane&quot; directed by Victor Salva with Rose McGowan, Ray Wise, and Lauren Vélez. She later starred in the horror film &quot;Dark House&quot; (2014), also directed by Victor Salva. She starred alongside Kirsten Vangsness in the period black-and-white comedy film &quot;Kill Me, Deadly&quot; playing dotty millionairess Lady Clairmont. The film was released in 2015. Also in 2015, Down appeared in another Steven Seagal action thriller, &quot;Absolution&quot;. The following year she appeared in the Lifetime movie &quot;I Am Watching You&quot; and played Jamie-Lynn Sigler&#x27; character mother in the Western film &quot;Justice&quot;. She co-starred in the Hallmark Holiday film &quot;A Cinderella Christmas&quot; in 2016. She appeared in the romantic comedy film &quot;Alex &amp; the List&quot; in 2018 and the horror film &quot;Gates of Darkness&quot; in 2019; she co-wrote the script for the latter.

In 2020, Down moved to Atlanta, bought a ranch-styled house and announced that she had retired from acting. Despite this, Down returned to work playing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 2024 biographical film &quot;Reagan&quot; starring Dennis Quaid.

==Personal life==

After ending a 10-year relationship with actor-writer Bruce Robinson, Down married Enrique Gabriel in 1980, but ended their marriage after a year and a half. Her second marriage was to film director William Friedkin from 1982 to 1985, with whom she had one son.

She met her third husband, cinematographer Don E. FauntLeRoy, during filming of the television miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; in 1985. Their relationship ended Down&#x27;s marriage to Friedkin and Fauntleroy&#x27;s marriage to Susan Ducat. The resulting legal and custody proceedings interrupted the careers of both Down and Fauntleroy for two years and ultimately cost Down and Friedkin each. Down and Fauntleroy have a son.

Down has spoken on several occasions about dealing with sexual predators in the film industry. In 2002, she spoke of finding fame in the late 1960s: &quot;The casting couch was in full swing, people expected it... My teenage years were pretty intense, a lot of pressure and a lot of horrible old men out there&quot;. In a 1977 interview, she had also said: &quot;I was promised lots of lovely big film parts by American producers if I went to bed with them. Believe me, the casting couch is no myth&quot;.

<doc id="764012" wikidata="Q7898398" url="?curid=764012" title="ʻUpolu Airport">
<text>Upolu Airport is a regional airport in Hawaii County, Hawaii, US. Located on the northern tip of the Big Island, it is northwest of the unincorporated town of Hawi.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a general aviation facility.

== History ==

Upolu Airport was built in 1927 for the United States Air Service to be under the control and management of the War Department. The land had previously been deeded to the Territory of Hawaii by the Hawaii Mill and Plantation Company. In 1933, the airfield was named &quot;Suiter Field&quot; by the U.S. Army in honor of 1st Lieutenant Wilbur C. Suiter of the 135th Aero Squadron. On September 18, 1930, Governor&#x27;s Executive Order No. 432 combined Territory of Hawaii land with the Suiter Field land to establish a territorial airport to be known as Upolu Airport.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
As a general aviation airport, Upolu Airport has a single runway without taxiways and two aircraft parking areas south of the runway. The east parking area supports passenger terminal operations and the west parking area provides tie down facilities for general aviation aircraft. The airport does not have a control tower, aircraft rescue and fire fighting facilities, or discrete air cargo facilities. Access to the airport is provided by a roadway off Akoni Pule Highway. In the event of increased air traffic, the Hawai&#x27;i State Legislature has made preliminary plans to build a parallel taxiway south of the runway and to move the existing terminal facilities farther from the runway to provide improved clearances and additional aircraft parking.

The airport covers an area of at an elevation of 96 feet (29 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 7/25 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,800 by 75 feet (1,158 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, the airport had 790 aircraft operations, an average of 65 per month: 89% general aviation, 10% military and 1% air taxi.

== Authority ==
Upolu Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawai&#x27;i. The official authority of Upolu Airport is the Governor of Hawai&#x27;i who appoints the director of the Hawai&#x27;i State Department of Transportation who has jurisdiction over the Hawai&#x27;i Airports Administrator.

The Hawai&#x27;i Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office and Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawai&#x27;i: Hawai&#x27;i District, Kaua&#x27;i District, Mau&#x27;i District and the principal O&#x27;ahu District. Upolu Airport is a subordinate of the Hawai&#x27;i District officials.

<doc id="764013" wikidata="Q289606" url="?curid=764013" title="Jenny Frost">
<text>Jennifer Frost (born 22 February 1978) is an English singer and television presenter. She is best known as member of girl groups Precious and Atomic Kitten, replacing Kerry Katona in the latter.

== Biography ==
Frost was born in Wallasey, Merseyside and grew up in Prestwich, near Manchester. She loved music from an early age. Her earliest concert experience was when her father took her to a Level 42 concert at the age of nine. Sport and dancing were Frost&#x27;s favourite activities, however, modelling was her dream. After attending St Monica&#x27;s High School she started to work for the BBC Television for the &quot;Holiday&quot; programme and travelling around the world.

==Career==
===1999–2005: Precious and Atomic Kitten ===

In 1998, Frost joined the girl group Precious, who were the UK entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, with the song &quot;Say It Again&quot;, peaking top 10 hit in UK. Subsequent releases by Precious enjoyed only modest success, and their debut album failed to chart at all, ultimately leading the group to go their separate ways in 2000. In 2001, Frost moved on by replacing Kerry Katona in Atomic Kitten, a girl group founded by OMD frontman Andy McCluskey. With Frost, Liz McClarnon and Natasha Hamilton, Atomic Kitten have had three UK number one singles, &quot;Whole Again&quot;, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, and &quot;The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)&quot;. The group also had two UK number one albums, &quot;Right Now&quot;, and &quot;Feels So Good&quot;, both being certified double-platinum in the UK for sales of over 600,000 copies each. The total worldwide sales are estimated at 6.2 million singles and 4 million albums.

===2005–2012: Television and hiatus===
After the split, Frost signed with Storm Model Management and became face for Nelsons (Homeopathy) products. In 2005 appeared on the 2005 edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; on the ITV network, where she was eliminated on day 14. Frost features on Route 1&#x27;s single &quot;Crash Landing&quot;, released on 10 October 2005, which peaked at number 47. Frost planned to release a solo album and recorded several songs, such as &quot;Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, but dropped it when she failed to sign with a record label. From 2008 to 2011, Frost presented the successful BBC Three programme &quot;Snog Marry Avoid?&quot;. Also in 2011 she co-presented &quot;OK! TV&quot; on Channel 5. In 2012 she presented the talk show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, her last work before taking a long hiatus from her artistic career to prioritize her family.

===2021–2022: Atomic Kitten return===
In 2013 Atomic Kitten were reformed, but Frost refused to rejoin them, and Kerry Katona returned as the third piece. From 2021 Frost rejoined Atomic Kitten.

== Personal life ==
From 2001 to August 2010 she dated the DJ Dominic Thrupp, with whom she had her first child, born on 9 October 2007. The couple planned to get married in January 2010, but they cancelled following the death of Frost&#x27;s mother Rita from lung cancer and, months later, they broke up. Frost&#x27;s father died in September 2017. In August 2011, she married Spanish scuba diver Vicente Juan Spiteri in Ibiza. Their twin daughters were born on 20 January 2013.

<text>Alois Carigiet (30 August 1902 – 1 August 1985) was a Swiss graphic designer, painter and illustrator. He may be known best for six children&#x27;s picture books set in the Alps, &quot;A Bell for Ursli&quot; and its sequels, written by Selina Chönz, and three that he wrote himself. In 1966 he received the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Medal for children&#x27;s illustrators.

==Biography==

===Early life and education (1902–1923)===
Alois Carigiet was the seventh of eleven children born to Alois Carigiet and Barbara Maria Carigiet, &quot;née&quot; Lombriser; the actor and comedian Zarli Carigiet was one younger brother. It was a farm family in Trun in the canton of Graubünden, where he grew up and spent his first school years. At home, the family spoke &quot;Sursilvan&quot;, the local Romansh dialect of the anterior Rhine valley. In 1911, economic hardship forced them to move to the canton&#x27;s German-speaking capital Chur where his father found employment. This relocation into a more urban environment had a strong impact on the nine-year-old. In retrospect, Carigiet described the move as an &quot;emigration to the low-lands&quot;, from a &quot;mountain boy&#x27;s paradise&quot; to a &quot;gloomy apartment on the ground floor in a narrow town alley&quot;.

Carigiet visited primary and secondary schools in Chur, as well as the &quot;Kantonsschule&quot;, the canton&#x27;s gymnasium, which he quit in 1918 in order to start an apprenticeship as a decorative designer and draftsman with master painter Martin Räth. While learning the art of graining, marbleizing, gold plating and other techniques of decorative art in Räth&#x27;s atelier, Carigiet spent a lot of his spare time filling volumes of sketchbooks with drawings of rural and urban scenes, farm animals and pets, anatomical studies of heads and beaks of the birds exhibited at Chur&#x27;s natural history museum, as well as with numerous caricatures of his acquaintances and family. Räth noticed the apprentice&#x27;s talent as well, and one of Carigiet&#x27;s appointed creations, an assembly of decorated vases for the Siebler &amp; Co. shop windows, seems to have received particular appreciation. Carigiet finished his apprenticeship in 1923, with the highest grade in every subject.

===Graphic design in Zürich (1923–1939)===
After having completed his apprenticeship, Carigiet sought work in Zürich and started a job as a practical trainee with Max Dalang&#x27;s advertisement agency in 1923, where he soon learned the techniques of graphic design and was hired as a regular employee. After having won several competitions and having gained a reputation, Carigiet opened his own graphic atelier in Zürich in 1927, employing up to six people at times, due to the constantly large volume of orders his business received. Carigiet created numerous commercial and political advertisement posters, festive decorations, educational posters and murals for schools, illustrations and satirical caricatures for the print media, as well as magazine covers for periodicals such as &quot;Schweizer Spiegel&quot; and &quot;SBB-Revue&quot;. Important work in the 1930s included a diorama for the Swiss Pavilion at the Paris International world fair in 1937, and set designs, murals and the official posters for the &quot;Landi&quot;, the Swiss national exposition held in Zürich in 1939.

===Artistic development===
Though he had never studied visual arts in the academic sense, Carigiet&#x27;s early graphic design was already strongly influenced by contemporary artists, such as El Lissitzky, whose use of photomontage in a poster announcing the exhibition of Russian avant-garde artists in Zürich, in 1928, inspired the design of a political campaign poster for Zürich&#x27;s mayor Emil Klöti. In the early 1930s Carigiet traveled to Paris, Munich, Vienna, and Salzburg where he became acquainted with the art movement &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;, as reflected in painted scenes of Paris in &quot;Das rote Haus am Montmartre&quot; (watercolor) and of Ascona in &quot;Haus und Garten in Ascona&quot; (oil painting on cardboard), both created in 1935. Contemporary expressionism had an influence on his work as well, including his commercial artwork. For example, the display of red horses and a green cow on posters for the OLMA, Switzerland’s annual national agricultural fair, in 1946 and 1952 received acclaim from art critics and questions from more conservative farmers, to which he succinctly replied that the cow was green because it had eaten grass.
Carigiet&#x27;s paintings increasingly depicted everyday motifs from his home canton Graubünden and occasionally Zürich, but also from further trips to France, Spain, and Lapland in the mid-1930s.

Carigiet always held a keen interest in the theatre, and had already worked in costume design in the late 1920s. With the help of art critic Jakob Rudolf Welti, he was commissioned as costume and stage designer for the Stadttheater Zürich performance of &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; in an adaptation by Max Werner Lenz, and created design work for three other programs at the Stadttheater as well. Carigiet was one of the founding members of the influential Cabaret Cornichon, a satirical cabaret program staged in the restaurant &quot;zum Hirschen&quot; in Zürich which would become one of the most significant political cabarets of German-speaking Switzerland during Germany&#x27;s Nazi regime. Carigiet designed the Cabaret&#x27;s logo, a grinning cornichon (gherkin) with a carrot-nose, and from 1935 to 1946 he created often parodistic costume and set designs for ten of the Cornichon’s programs, including a heavily decorated barrel organ used by his brother Zarli who was also a member of the Cabaret&#x27;s ensemble.

===Platenga (1939 – 1950)===
While spending a holiday in Trun in May 1939, Carigiet hiked to &quot;Platenga&quot;, a hamlet on one of the terraces in the community of Obersaxen, where, in his own words, he was immediately fascinated by the landscape&#x27;s vastness and untouchedness and the feeling of a newly found, long lost paradise. He gave up his business in Zürich, and, in October 1939, rented a small farm house without electricity or running water, the &quot;Hüs am Bach&quot; (&quot;house at the creek&quot;) in Platenga. Carigiet wished to dedicate his life to art and observation, spending hours a day, equipped with a pair of binoculars and a sketch book, tracking down the alpine fauna.

On 20 April 1943, Carigiet married Berta Carolina Müller (1911–1980) an art student from Halle whom he had met in Germany. After their first daughter was born in 1944, they bought land near Platenga&#x27;s chapel. In 1945 Carigiet designed plans for a larger house which was built in 1946. In 1947, the second daughter was born in the new house, called &quot;Im Sunnefang&quot;. Mainly for the sake of the girls&#x27; education, the family moved back to Zürich in 1950, where Carigiet took up his work as a graphic designer again, while also continuing his artistic pursuits.

===Children&#x27;s books===
In 1940, Carigiet was approached by the Romansh-speaking author Selina Chönz who asked him to illustrate her story &quot;Uorsin&quot; to create a children&#x27;s picture book. After several years of hesitating, Carigiet finally agreed, and spent several weeks sketching the scenery and architecture in Guarda, Chönz&#x27;s home village in the Lower Engadin, after which he modeled the protagonist&#x27;s village. In October 1945 the book was published in German as &quot;Uorsin (Schellen-Ursli. Ein Engadiner Bilderbuch)&quot; and later in English as &quot;A Bell for Ursli&quot; (1950). The story follows the boy Ursli&#x27;s perilous climb through snow to an abandoned summer hut in order to retrieve a large &quot;trychel&quot; for the annual Chalandamarz celebration on 1 March. The book has been translated into ten languages with total sales estimated around 1.7 million worldwide. Carigiet&#x27;s dramatic and colorful compositions were noticed and positively reviewed by art critics including Manuel Gasser in &quot;Graphis Inc.&quot; or Linus Birchler, editor-in-chief of the series &quot;Art Monuments of Switzerland&quot; and member of the Swiss Federal Art Commission.

Carigiet and Chönz created a series of Alpine children&#x27;s books with two sequels featuring Ursli&#x27;s younger sister: &quot;Flurina (Flurina und das Wildvögelein. Schellen-Ursli&#x27;s Schwester)&quot; in 1952 (English title: &quot;Florina and the Wild Bird&quot;) and &quot;La naivera (Der grosse Schnee)&quot; in 1957 (&quot;The Snowstorm&quot;). In the 1960s, Carigiet continued on his own, illustrating &quot;and&quot; writing &quot;Zottel, Zick und Zwerg. Eine Geschichte von drei Geissen&quot; in 1965 (&quot;Anton the Goatherd&quot;), &quot;Birnbaum, Birke, Berberitze. Eine Geschichte aus den Bündner Bergen&quot; in 1967 (&quot;The Pear Tree, the Birch Tree and the Barberry Bush&quot;), and &quot;Maurus und Madleina. Über den Berg in die Stadt&quot; in 1969 (&quot;Anton and Anne&quot;). In 1966, he was awarded the Schweizer Jugendbuchpreis (Swiss youth book prize) for &quot;Zottel, Zick und Zwerg&quot;.

The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award, conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People and first awarded in 1956, is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Carigiet received the inaugural Illustrator award in 1966.

===Later life (1960 – 1985)===
In 1960, Carigiet bought the house &quot;Flutginas&quot; (ferns) located above Trun, his village of childhood, where he would spend the rest of his life dedicated to painting. In a speech held in Zürich in 1962, he described his works as &quot;narrative art&quot; in a century of abstraction, and named Georges Rouault, &quot;the greatest of all&quot;, as an exemplary inspiration for his artistic approach. Until 1982, he frequently exhibited his artwork in Switzerland, but also in Toronto (1969) and Frankfurt (1971). Alois Carigiet died on 1 August 1985 in Trun.

<doc id="764016" wikidata="Q3990847" url="?curid=764016" title="Thread pool">
<text>In computer programming, a thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program. Often also called a replicated workers or worker-crew model, a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program. By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks. Another good property - the ability to limit system load, when we use fewer threads than available. The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available to the program, such as a parallel task queue after completion of execution.

==Performance==
The size of a thread pool is the number of threads kept in reserve for executing tasks. It is usually a tunable parameter of the application, adjusted to optimize program performance. Deciding the optimal thread pool size is crucial to optimize performance.

One benefit of a thread pool over creating a new thread for each task is that thread creation and destruction overhead is restricted to the initial creation of the pool, which may result in better performance and better system stability. Creating and destroying a thread and its associated resources can be an expensive process in terms of time. An excessive number of threads in reserve, however, wastes memory, and context-switching between the runnable threads invokes performance penalties. A socket connection to another network host, which might take many CPU cycles to drop and re-establish, can be maintained more efficiently by associating it with a thread that lives over the course of more than one network transaction.

Using a thread pool may be useful even putting aside thread startup time. There are implementations of thread pools that make it trivial to queue up work, control concurrency and sync threads at a higher level than can be done easily when manually managing threads. In these cases the performance benefits of use may be secondary.

Typically, a thread pool executes on a single computer. However, thread pools are conceptually related to server farms in which a master process, which might be a thread pool itself, distributes tasks to worker processes on different computers, in order to increase the overall throughput. Embarrassingly parallel problems are highly amenable to this approach.

The number of threads may be dynamically adjusted during the lifetime of an application based on the number of waiting tasks. For example, a web server can add threads if numerous web page requests come in and can remove threads when those requests taper down. The cost of having a larger thread pool is increased resource usage. The algorithm used to determine when to create or destroy threads affects the overall performance:
* Creating too many threads wastes resources and costs time creating the unused threads.
* Destroying too many threads requires more time later when creating them again.
* Creating threads too slowly might result in poor client performance (long wait times).
* Destroying threads too slowly may starve other processes of resources.

== In languages ==
In bash implemented by codice_1 / codice_2 in xargs, for example:
# Fetch 5 URLs in parallel
urls=(
 &quot;https://example.com/file1.txt&quot;
 &quot;https://example.com/file2.txt&quot;
 &quot;https://example.com/file3.txt&quot;
 &quot;https://example.com/file4.txt&quot;
 &quot;https://example.com/file5.txt&quot;

printf &#x27;%s\n&#x27; &quot;${urls[@]}&quot; | xargs -P 5 -I {} curl -sI {} | grep -i &quot;content-length:&quot;

In Go, called worker pool:
package main

import (
 &quot;fmt&quot;
 &quot;time&quot;

func worker(id int, jobs &lt;-chan int, results chan&lt;- int) {
 for j := range jobs {
 fmt.Println(&quot;worker&quot;, id, &quot;started job&quot;, j)
 time.Sleep(time.Second)
 fmt.Println(&quot;worker&quot;, id, &quot;finished job&quot;, j)
 results &lt;- j * 2
}

func main() {

 const numJobs = 5
 jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
 results := make(chan int, numJobs)

 for w := 1; w &lt;= 3; w++ {
 go worker(w, jobs, results)

 for j := 1; j &lt;= numJobs; j++ {
 jobs &lt;- j
 close(jobs)

 for a := 1; a &lt;= numJobs; a++ {
 &lt;-results
}
It will print:

<text>Fernando José Lunar [loo-NAR] (born May 25, 1977), is a former Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Atlanta Braves (2000) and Baltimore Orioles (2000–02). He batted and threw right-handed. He played minor league baseball through 2007.

==Career==
On June 24, 2000, while playing for the Atlanta Braves against the Milwaukee Brewers, Lunar was called for receiving a pitch with his foot outside of the catcher&#x27;s box. A balk was assessed to pitcher Greg Maddux. Such a call, known as a &quot;catcher&#x27;s balk&quot;, is rarely seen in baseball.

<text>The Skipanon River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It is the last tributary of the Columbia on the Oregon side, draining an area of coastal bottom land bordered by sand dunes and entering the river from the south at its mouth west of Astoria.

The Skipanon River issues from Cullaby Lake in western Clatsop County, northeast of Seaside and less than from the ocean. It flows north parallel to the coast and east of U.S. Route 101. It enters the northwest end of Youngs Bay at the mouth of the Columbia approximately northeast of Warrenton. The mouth of the river is at river mile of the Columbia upstream from its mouth.

The river&#x27;s name comes from the Clatsop language, originally referring to a point at the river&#x27;s mouth rather than the river itself. The charts of the Lewis and Clark Expedition show the stream as Skipanarwin Creek. Another variant spelling, Skeppernawin, was common on maps into the 20th century.

<text>Pori Jazz is a large international jazz festival, held annually during the month of July in the coastal city of Pori (a population of 82,809 in January 2010), Finland. It is one of the oldest and best known jazz festivals in Europe, having been arranged every year since 1966.

==History==
The first, 2-day-long Pori Jazz Festival was held at the Kirjurinluoto island in July 1966 with 1500 visitors. Audiences grew from year to year and the duration of the festival was also increased. Between 1975 and 1984 it became established as a four-day event. Since 1985 the festival has lasted nine days with audiences numbering from 50,000 to 60,000. In the early 1990s the numbers reached 100,000 visitors and in 21st century about 120,000–160,000 people are visiting the festival every summer. In 2014 Pori Jazz had its 49th edition and is already planning its 50th anniversary in 2015. At the moment Pori Jazz Festival is the biggest, best known and most popular summer event in Finland.

The first festival was based on acoustic jazz but little by little electric jazz and other rhythm music, blues, soul, funk, hip-hop and the rich Cuban and Brazilian music took foot. Now Pori Jazz offers a broad contingent of the world&#x27;s leading artists ranging from long-established figures to up-and-coming stars. About 70 per cent of the program is admission free.

Pori Jazz has managed to keep in the lead among Finnish and international festivals for already over 45 years. The festival atmosphere in particular, created by the music, people, fine services and unique milieu, is second to none and highly appreciated among the visitors. The festival has become an experience the visitors want to repeat every summer. There are over 100 concerts in 11 different venues during 9 festival days. A special Pori Jazz Kids Festival is also arranged for children.

The 49th edition of Pori Jazz Festival was held from 12 to 20 July 2014.

The main venue, Kirjurinluoto Arena, is the only open-air concert park in Finland that is built only for concerts and other happenings. The size of the arena is for amphitheater-type concerts plus for camping. As well as the main venue, which requires a festival ticket to enter, there is a &quot;Jazz street&quot; in the centre of Pori, along the shore of the Kokemäenjoki river, holding smaller music events and clubs as well as street food restaurants and bars. The outdoor music events on the &quot;Jazz street&quot; are free of charge, but events held in clubs might require an entrance fee.

Numerous world-famous musicians (including, for example, Tori Amos, Kylie Minogue, Art Blakey, James Brown, Phil Collins, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Alicia Keys, Paul Simon, Jamiroquai, Macy Gray, Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu, Paul Anka, Kanye West, Sting and others) have performed at the festival through the years, as well as lesser-known groups from Finland and elsewhere. Musical genres covered at Pori Jazz include varieties of jazz, blues, soul, funk, hip hop, Afro-Cuban, world music, and occasionally even some forms of pop music.

<text>Louise Nevelson (September 23, 1899 – April 17, 1988) was an American sculptor known for her monumental, monochromatic, wooden wall pieces and outdoor sculptures. Born in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine), she emigrated with her family to the United States in the early 20th century. Nevelson learned English at school, as she spoke Yiddish at home.

By the early 1930s she was attending art classes at the Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and experimented with painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. The sculptures are typically painted in monochromatic black or white.

A prominent figure in the international art scene, Nevelson participated in the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work has been included in museum and corporate collections in Europe and North America. Nevelson remains one of the most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.

== Life and artistic career ==

=== 1899–1920s: Early life ===

Louise Nevelson was born Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Pereiaslav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a contractor and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson&#x27;s relatives had begun to leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s.

The Berliawskys had to stay behind, as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson&#x27;s siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (born 1902). On his mother&#x27;s death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father&#x27;s departure that she became mute for six months.

In 1905, Minna and the children emigrated to the United States, where they joined Isaac in Rockland, Maine. Isaac initially struggled to establish himself there, suffering from depression while the family settled into their new home. He worked as a woodcutter before opening a junkyard. His work as a lumberjack made wood a consistent presence in the family household, a material that would figure prominently in Nevelson&#x27;s work. Eventually, he became a successful lumberyard owner and realtor. Another child, Lillian, was born in 1906. Nevelson was very close to her mother, who suffered from depression, perhaps brought on by the family&#x27;s migration from Russia and their minority status as a Jewish family living in Maine. Minna overly compensated for this, dressing herself and the children up in clothing &quot;regarded as sophisticated in the Old Country&quot;. Her mother wore flamboyant outfits with heavy make-up; Nevelson described her mother&#x27;s &quot;dressing up&quot; as &quot;art, her pride, and her job&quot;, also describing her as someone who should have lived &quot;in a palace&quot;.

Nevelson&#x27;s first experience of art was at the age of nine at the Rockland Public Library, where she saw a plaster cast of Joan of Arc. Shortly thereafter she decided to study art, taking drawing in high school, where she also served as basketball captain. She painted watercolor interiors, in which furniture appeared molecular in structure, rather like her later professional work. Female figures made frequent appearances. In school, she practiced her English, her second language, as Yiddish was spoken at home. Unhappy with her family&#x27;s economic status, language differences, the religious discrimination of the community, and her school, Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York.

She graduated from high school in 1918, and began working as a stenographer at a local law office. There she met Bernard Nevelson, co-owner with his brother Charles of the Nevelson Brothers Company, a shipping business. Bernard introduced her to his brother, and Charles and Louise Nevelson were married in June 1920 in a Jewish wedding at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. Having satisfied her parents&#x27; hope that she would marry into a wealthy family, she and her new husband moved to New York City, where she began to study painting, drawing, singing, acting, and dancing. She also became pregnant, and in 1922 she gave birth to her son Myron (later called Mike), who grew up to be a sculptor. Nevelson studied art, despite the disapproval of her parents-in-law. She commented: &quot;My husband&#x27;s family was terribly refined. Within that circle you could know Beethoven, but God forbid if you were Beethoven.&quot;

In 1924 the family moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was upset with the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she separated from Charles, unwilling to become the socialite wife he expected her to be. She never sought financial support from Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.

===1930s: Study and experimentation===

Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art full-time at the Art Students League. Nevelson credited an exhibition of Noh kimono at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a catalyst for her to study art further. In 1931, she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike&#x27;s birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied at the Art Students League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera&#x27;s wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance.

Nevelson continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. In 1936, Nevelson won her first sculpture competition at the A.C.A Galleries in New York. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace. This firewood served as the starting point for the art that made her famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Nevelson also created ink and pencil drawings, terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.

=== 1940s: First exhibitions ===

In 1941, Nevelson had her first solo exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery, which represented her until 1947. During her time at Nierendorf, Nevelson obtained a shoeshine box from a local shoeshiner. She displayed the box at the Museum of Modern Art, bringing her the first major attention she received from the press. An article about her appeared in &quot;Art Digest&quot; in November 1943. In that year, Nevelson exhibited her work in Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s show &quot;Exhibition by 31 Women&quot; at the Art of This Century gallery in New York.

In the 1940s, she began producing Cubist figure studies in materials such as stone, bronze, terra cotta, and wood. In 1943, she had a show at Norlyst Gallery called &quot;The Clown as the Center of his World&quot; in which she constructed sculptures about the circus from found objects. The show was not well received, and Nevelson stopped using found objects until the mid-1950s. Despite poor reception, Nevelson&#x27;s works at this time explored both figurative abstracts inspired by Cubism and the exploitative and experimental influence of surrealism. The decade provided Nevelson with the materials, movements, and self-created experiments that would mold her signature modernist style in the 1950s.

=== 1950s–1960s: Mid-career ===

During the 1950s, Nevelson exhibited her work as often as possible. Yet despite awards and growing popularity with art critics, she continued to struggle financially. She began teaching sculpture classes in adult education programs in the Great Neck public school system. Her own work began to grow to monumental size, moving beyond the human scale works of the early 1940s. Nevelson also visited Latin America and was influenced by Mayan ruins and the steles of Guatemala. In 1954, Nevelson&#x27;s street in Kips Bay was among those slated for demolition and redevelopment, and her increasing use of scrap materials in the years ahead drew upon on refuse left on the streets by her evicted neighbors. In 1955, Nevelson joined Colette Roberts&#x27; Grand Central Modern Gallery, where she had numerous one-woman shows.

There she exhibited some of her most notable mid-century works: &quot;Bride of the Black Moon&quot;, &quot;First Personage&quot;, and the exhibit &quot;Moon Garden + One&quot;, which showed her first wall piece, &quot;Sky Cathedral&quot;, in 1958. From 1957 to 1958, she was president of the New York Chapter of Artists&#x27; Equity where she forged a long friendship and advocacy with Norman Carton, a former Philadelphia Artist Equity president. In 1958, Carton helped Nevelson join Martha Jackson Gallery, where he worked and exhibited. At Martha Jackson, she was then guaranteed income and became financially secure. That year, she was photographed and featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; and had her first Martha Jackson solo exhibit.

In 1960, she had her first one-woman show in Europe at Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris. Later that year a collection of her work, grouped together as &quot;Dawn&#x27;s Wedding Feast&quot;, was included in the group show, &quot;Sixteen Americans&quot;, at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1962, she made her first museum sale to the Whitney Museum of American Art, which purchased the black wall &quot;Young Shadows&quot;. That same year, her work was selected for the 31st Venice Biennale and she became national president of Artists&#x27; Equity, serving until 1964.

In 1962 she left Martha Jackson Gallery for a brief stint at the Sidney Janis Gallery. After an unsuccessful first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her and was unable to recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily have gone. I didn&#x27;t care so much about the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed to get out of town and all of my expenses were paid.&quot;

At Tamarind, Nevelson made twenty-six lithographs, becoming the most productive artist to complete the fellowship up until that time. The lithographs she created were some of her most creative graphic work, using unconventional materials like cheese cloth, lace, and textiles on the lithographic stone to create interesting textural effects. With fresh creative inspiration and replenished funds, Nevelson returned to New York. She joined Pace Gallery in the fall of 1963, where she had shows regularly until the end of her career. In 1967 the Whitney Museum hosted the first retrospective of Nevelson&#x27;s work, showing over one hundred pieces, including drawings from the 1930s and contemporary sculptures. In 1964, she created two works: &quot;Homage to 6,000,000 I&quot; and &quot;Homage to 6,000,000 II&quot; as a tribute to victims of The Holocaust. Nevelson hired several assistants over the years, including Diana MacKown. By this time, Nevelson had solidified commercial and critical success.

=== 1970s–death: Later career ===

Nevelson continued to use wood in her sculptures, but also experimented with other materials such as aluminum, plastic and metal. &quot;Black Zag X&quot; from 1969, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist&#x27;s all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic Formica. In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: &quot;Remember, I was in my early seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture ... I had been through the enclosures of wood. I had been through the shadows. I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open.&quot; Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a &quot;blessing&quot;.

She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson&#x27;s public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport stated that Nevelson&#x27;s &quot;intuitive gesture&quot; is not evident in the large steel works. In spite of that, Nevelson was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal in 1969.

In 1972–1973, she created her &quot;Dream Houses&quot; sculptures, of small pieces of wood assembled into house shapes and characteristically painted black. The works differ from many of her pieces in being fully three-dimensional rather than presenting a single façade, though each façade is recognizable as a Nevelson work.

In 1973, the Walker Art Center curated a major exhibition of her work, which traveled for two years. In 1975, she designed the chapel of St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Midtown Manhattan. When asked about her role as a Jewish artist creating Christian-themed art, Nevelson stated that her abstract work transcended religious barriers. Also in 1975, she created and installed a large wood sculpture titled &quot;Bicentennial Dawn&quot; at the new James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia.

During the last half of her life, Nevelson solidified her fame and her persona by cultivating a style for her &quot;petite yet flamboyant&quot; self that contributed to her legacy: dramatic dresses, scarves and large false eyelashes. When Alice Neel asked Nevelson how she dressed so beautifully, Nevelson replied &quot;Fucking, dear, fucking&quot;, in reference to her sexually liberated lifestyle. The designer Arnold Scaasi created many of her clothes.

Nevelson died on April 17, 1988.

At the time of his death in 1995, her friend Willy Eisenhart was working on a book about Nevelson.

== Style and works ==

=== Approach ===


When Nevelson developed her style, many of her artistic colleagues were welding metal to create large-scale sculptures. Nevelson decided to go in the opposite direction by exploring the streets for inspiration and finding it in wood. Nevelson&#x27;s most notable sculptures are her wooden, wall-like, collage-driven reliefs consisting of multiple boxes and compartments that hold abstract shapes and found objects from chair legs to balusters. Nevelson described these immersive sculptures as &quot;environments&quot;. The wooden pieces were also cast-off scraps, pieces found in the streets of New York.

Nevelson took found objects and spray painted them to disguise their actual function or meaning. Nevelson called herself &quot;the original recycler&quot; owing to her extensive use of discarded objects. She found strong influence in Cubism, describing it as &quot;one of the greatest awarenesses that the human mind has ever come to.&quot; She also found influence in Native American and Mayan art, dreams, the cosmos and archetypes. Moreover, Nevelson was inspired by the work of Joaquín Torres García, an Uruguayan artist who &quot;in the United States was probably underrated precisely because he was so influential; Adolph Gottlieb&#x27;s and Louise Nevelson&#x27;s debt to his work has never been fully acknowledged&quot;.

Nevelson&#x27;s limited palette of black and white, became central. She spray painted her walls black until 1959. Nevelson stated that black &quot;means totality. It means: contains all. It contained all color. It wasn&#x27;t a negation of color. It was an acceptance. Because black encompasses all colors. Black is the most aristocratic color of all. The only aristocratic color ... I have seen things that were transformed into black that took on greatness. I don&#x27;t want to use a lesser word.&quot; In the 1960s, she began incorporating white and gold into her works.

Nevelson said that white was the color that &quot;summoned the early morning and emotional promise.&quot; She described her gold phase as the &quot;baroque phase&quot;, inspired by her having been told as a child that America&#x27;s streets were &quot;paved with gold&quot; and by the materialism and hedonism of the color, the Sun, and the Moon. Nevelson researched the Noh robes and the gold coin collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration.

Through her work, Nevelson often explored her complicated past, factious present, and anticipated future. A common symbol that appears in Nevelson&#x27;s work is the bride, as seen in &quot;Bride of the Black Moon&quot; (1955). This referenced her escape from matrimony in her early life, as well as her independence throughout her life. Her &quot;Sky Cathedral&quot; works often took years to create; &quot;Sky Cathedral: Night Wall&quot;, in the collection of the Columbus Museum of Art, took 13 years to build in her New York City studio. On the &quot;Sky Cathedral&quot; series, Nevelson commented: &quot;This is the Universe, the stars, the moon – and you and I, everyone.&quot;

Nevelson&#x27;s work has been exhibited in many American galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery, Woodward Gallery, and Pace Gallery in New York City and the Margot Gallery in Lake Worth, Florida.

Her work is included in museum collections worldwide such as Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington DC; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Guggenheim Museum.

=== Public works ===

Nevelson has been described as &quot;the first woman to gain fame in the U.S. for her public art&quot;. In 1978, the City of New York commissioned a sculpture garden, Louise Nevelson Plaza (formerly Legion Memorial Square), located between Maiden Lane, Liberty Street and William Street in Lower Manhattan, to showcase some of her large-scale sculptures. It became the first public space in New York City to be named after an artist. Having undergone significant alterations since its inception, including a complete redesign of the plaza in 2007–2010, it is now managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In December 1978, Nevelson dedicated another public sculpture in the Lower Manhattan; titled &quot;Sky Gate, New York&quot; it was installed in the mezzanine lobby of 1 World Trade Center on the opposite site of Financial District.

== Legacy ==
Between 1966 and 1979, Nevelson donated her papers to numerous non-profit institutions in several instalments. Now, these are fully digitized and in the collection of the Archives of American Art. The Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine houses the second largest collection of her works, including jewelry she designed. In 2000, the United States Postal Service released a series of commemorative postage stamps in Nevelson&#x27;s honor.

The following year, friend and playwright Edward Albee wrote the play &quot;Occupant&quot; as a homage to the sculptor. The show opened in New York in 2002 with Anne Bancroft playing Nevelson, but because of Bancroft&#x27;s illness it never moved beyond previews. Washington DC&#x27;s Theater J mounted a revival in November 2019. Nevelson&#x27;s distinct and eccentric image has been documented by many celebrated photographers. Nevelson is listed on the Heritage Floor, among other famous women, in Judy Chicago&#x27;s 1974–1979 masterpiece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;.

Upon Nevelson&#x27;s death, her estate was worth at least $100 million. Her son Mike removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works (worth millions) to her friend and assistant of 25 years, Diana MacKown.

In 2005, Maria Nevelson, the youngest granddaughter, established the Louise Nevelson Foundation, a non-profit 501c(3). Its mission is to educate the public and celebrate the life and work of Louise Nevelson, thus furthering her legacy and place in American Art History. Maria Nevelson lectures widely on her grandmother at museums and provides research services. 

Nevelson&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

=== Feminism and Nevelson&#x27;s influence on feminist art ===

Louise Nevelson has been a fundamental key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, and totem-like artworks that art historians have seen as masculine. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not &quot;masculine-feminine labels&quot;, and chose to take on her role as an artist, not a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson&#x27;s works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: &quot;We learned the artist is a woman in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns.&quot; Another review showed similar sexism: &quot;Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You&#x27;ll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her &quot;Portraits in Paint&quot;, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery.&quot;

Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by collaging the heads of notable women artists over each man&#x27;s head, and Nevelson was among them. This image, addressing the role of religious and art-historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement&quot;.

Even with her influence upon feminist artists, Nevelson&#x27;s opinion of discrimination within the art world bordered on the belief that artists who were not gaining success based on gender suffered from a lack of confidence. When asked by &quot;Feminist Art Journal&quot; if she suffered from sexism within the art world, Nevelson replied: &quot;I &quot;am&quot; a woman&#x27;s liberation.&quot; The former president of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art said, &quot;In Nevelson&#x27;s case, she was the most ferocious artist there was. She was the most determined, the most forceful, the most difficult. She just forced her way in. And so that was one way to do it, but not all women chose to, or could take, that route.&quot;

<text>Ernest Alonzo Nevers (June 11, 1902 – May 3, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Big Dog&quot;, was an American professional football and baseball player and football coach. Widely regarded as one of the best football players in the first half of the 20th century, he played as a fullback and was a triple-threat man known for his talents in running, passing, and kicking. He was inducted with the inaugural classes of inductees into both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. He was also named in 1969 to the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team.

Nevers played four sports (football, basketball, baseball, and track and field) for Stanford University from 1923 to 1925 and was a consensus first-team All-American in football in 1925. He played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Duluth Eskimos in 1926 and 1927 and the Chicago Cardinals from 1929 to 1931. In 1929, one week after defeating the Dayton Triangles, who were playing in their final game before moving to Brooklyn to embark on their long and tenuous history through the league, he set an NFL record that still stands by scoring 40 points in a single game. In the same game he subsequently set another NFL record by scoring six rushing touchdowns in a single game against the Chicago Bears, a record that remained unequaled until the 2020 season in which New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara also accomplished the feat, scoring six touchdowns against the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. Nevers also played professional baseball as a pitcher for the St. Louis Browns of the American League from 1926 to 1928 and the Mission Bells of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1928 and 1929.

Nevers also had a long career as a football coach, including stints with the Stanford Indians (assistant, 1928, 1932–1935), the Chicago Cardinals (head coach, 1930–1931, 1939), Lafayette Leopards (head coach, 1936), Iowa Hawkeyes (assistant, 1937–1938), and the Chicago Rockets (assistant, 1946).

==Early life==
Nevers&#x27; parents, George and Mary Ann Nevers, were immigrants to the United States from New Brunswick, Canada. In addition to Ernie, they had five sons (Harry, Frank, John, George, and Arthur) and one daughter (Edith). By the time Nevers was born, the family had moved from New Brunswick to Willow River, Minnesota, where Nevers was born in 1902. The family moved again to Superior, Wisconsin, where Nevers grew up and attended Superior Central High School. In 1920, the family moved to a ranch and fruit farm in the Rincon Valley section of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California. Nevers attended Santa Rosa High School for the first half of his senior year. He led the Santa Rosa football team by scoring 108 of the team&#x27;s 170 points. After starting the basketball season for Santa Rosa, he returned to Superior early in 1921 to play for Central. He graduated from Central that spring.

In 1921, Nevers attended Santa Rosa Junior College and was the star of the school&#x27;s football team. In a game against Petaluma, he scored four touchdowns and kicked six extra points and a field goal.

==Stanford University==
In 1922, Nevers enrolled at Stanford University. He played for the freshman football team at fullback and halfback in the fall of 1922.

===1923–24 academic year===
As a sophomore, Nevers became a star for the 1923 Stanford varsity football team. He was described as &quot;a sweet punter and a general all-around backfield star&quot; and &quot;the backbone of the Stanford offense.&quot;

In the final game of the 1923 season, the dedication game for California Memorial Stadium, Nevers gained more yards than the entire California team, even though Cal won the Big Game 9–0. After the game, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The desperate drive of Ernie Nevers . . . will go down in history as one of the greatest individual efforts ever seen on a gridiron.&quot;

At the end of the 1923 season, Nevers was selected by the United Press as the first-team All-Pacific Coast fullback. 
He was also selected by Walter Camp as the third-team fullback on the 1923 College Football All-America Team.

After the 1923 football season was over, Nevers demonstrated his overall athletic ability by also starring for Stanford&#x27;s basketball, baseball and track teams. He was rated as the Pacific coast&#x27;s best player in both football and basketball, the best college pitcher, one of the leading track performers, and &quot;a crack swimmer&quot; as well. In April 1924, Stanford&#x27;s assistant director of physical education, Harry Maloney, called Nevers &quot;a freak genius&quot; who also excelled in the classroom.

===1924–25 academic year===
As a junior, Nevers was sidelined for most of the football season after suffering two broken ankles. Under head coach Pop Warner, the 1925 Stanford football team won the Pacific Coast Conference championship with a 7–0–1 record in the regular season before losing to Notre Dame and the famous Four Horsemen backfield in the 1925 Rose Bowl. Five days after having a cast removed from one of his ankles, Nevers played all 60 minutes of the Rose Bowl, averaged 42 yards on his punts, and carried the ball 34 times for 114 yards, only 13 yards less than all the Four Horsemen combined.

Nevers again proved to be a multi-sport star, competing for Stanford&#x27;s basketball and baseball teams in the winter and spring of 1925. A newspaper account from February 1925 stated that he was &quot;pressing for honors as the best all around athlete in the annals of the west.&quot; During the summer of 1925, Nevers worked for the Starrett Meat Company in Guerneville, California, and pitched for the town&#x27;s baseball team.

===1925 season===
As a senior, Nevers and Pop Warner led the 1925 Stanford football team to a 7–2 record. At the end of the 1925 season, Nevers was a consensus All-American, receiving first-team honors from, among others, the All-America Board, the Associated Press, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, the International News Service, &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and &quot;Athlete &amp; Sportsman&quot; magazine.

==Professional football and baseball player==
===Jacksonville football team===
In December 1925, Nevers received between $25,000 and $35,000 to play professional football for a team in Jacksonville, Florida. Nevers&#x27; team played two exhibition games against NFL opponents: the Chicago Bears, led by Red Grange, on January 2, and the New York Giants on January 9. However, meager crowds forced the team to fold after only two games.

===1926 St. Louis Browns===
After his first venture with professional football ended, Nevers joined the St. Louis Browns of Major League Baseball. He appeared in 12 games, 11 as a pitcher, for the 1926 Browns, compiling a 2–4 win–loss record and a 4.46 earned run average (ERA) in 74-2/3 innings pitched. At the plate, he had a .185 batting average in 27 at bats. Nevers threw the ball in an unusual underhand delivery. On August 13, 1926, in the highlight of Nevers&#x27; 1926 season, he pitched a complete game victory over the Detroit Tigers, giving up eight hits and two runs against a lineup that included Hall of Famers Ty Cobb, Heinie Manush, Charlie Gehringer, and Harry Heilmann, and Bob Fothergill who hit .367 that year.

===1926 Duluth Eskimos===
In September 1926, Nevers left the Browns to play professional football for the Duluth Eskimos of the National Football League (NFL). Nevers&#x27; childhood friend Ole Haugsrud owned the Eskimos. The 1926 Eskimos, with a 16-man roster, played a 29-game schedule and compiled a 19–7–3 record. Nevers reportedly played 1,714 minutes out of a possible 1,740 minutes that year. Highlights of Nevers&#x27; 1926 season included the following:
* On September 19, 1926, in Nevers&#x27; first game for Duluth, the Eskimos played their only home game, defeating the Kansas City Cowboys, 7–0. Nevers scored the game&#x27;s only touchdown, kicked the extra point, and was reportedly &quot;here, there and everywhere performing in a triple threat role.&quot;
* On October 10, 1926, Nevers led the Eskimos to a 26–0 victory over the Hammond Pros. Nevers threw a touchdown pass to Joe Rooney and also scored a rushing touchdown.
* On October 17, 1926, Nevers threw a touchdown pass, scored a rushing touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21–0 victory over the Racine Tornadoes.
* On October 31, 1926, the Eskimos defeated the Milwaukee Badgers, 7–6. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Nevers as &quot;the whole show&quot;, noting that he threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Rooney in the final five minutes and then kicked the extra point to give the Eskimos the victory.
* On November 11, 1926, Nevers scored all 13 Duluth points (two rushing touchdowns and an extra point) in a 14–13 loss to the New York Giants. Nevers&#x27; second touchdown was scored in the fourth quarter, but his kick for extra point to tie the game was blocked by Tillie Voss.
* On November 21, 1926, Nevers scored every point for the Eskimos in a 10–2 over the Canton Bulldogs. Nevers rushed for a touchdown and kicked a field goal and an extra point.
* On November 27, 1926, Nevers scored every point in a 16–0 victory over the Hartford Blues. He kicked three field goals, including one from placement at the 45-yard line, scored a touchdown, and kicked an extra point. After the game, &quot;The Hartford Daily Courant&quot; wrote: &quot;The men of Nevers type must be depended upon to build professional football if it is to survive.&quot;

Out of the 29 games played by the Eskimos in 1926, 14 are considered official by the NFL; in those games, Nevers scored 71 points on eight touchdowns, 11 extra points, and four field goals. At the end of his rookie season, Nevers was a consensus pick for the fullback position on the 1926 All-Pro Team, receiving first-team honors from &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot; magazine, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;.

===1927 St. Louis Browns===
Nevers returned to the St. Louis Browns in 1927. He appeared in 33 games for the team, 27 as a pitcher, and compiled a 3–8 win–loss record and a 4.94 ERA in innings pitched and a .219 batting average in 32 at bats. He is often remembered for having given up two home runs to Babe Ruth during the 1927 season in which Ruth broke the major league record with 60 home runs.

===1927 Duluth Eskimos===
In 1927, Nevers became head coach of the Eskimos in addition to his regular position at fullback. The 1927 Eskimos compiled a 1–8 record and finished in 11th place in the NFL. Highlights of Nevers 1927 season included the following:

* On October 23, 1927, Nevers completed 16 of 20 passes and threw four touchdown passes in a 27–0 victory over the Pottsville Maroons. 
* On October 30, 1927, Nevers scored all 20 Duluth points on three touchdowns and two extra points in a 21–20 loss to the Cleveland Bulldogs.
* On November 13, 1927, Nevers ran 36 yards for a touchdown and kicked the extra point to account for Duluth&#x27;s scoring in a 13–7 loss to the Providence Steam Roller.
* On December 11, 1927, Nevers threw two touchdown passes to Cobb Rooney and kicked two extra points to account for all 14 Duluth points in a 27–14 loss to the Chicago Bears.

===Mission Bells and Stanford football===
Nevers career in Major League Baseball came to an end in the spring of 1928. In six games for the Browns, he compiled a 1–0 record and 3.00 ERA in nine innings pitched. His final major league appearance was on May 4, 1928, at age 25. Nevers was sold by the Browns for $7,500 to the Mission Bells, a Pacific Coast League baseball team in San Francisco, in late May 1928. He appeared in 35 games for the Reds in 1928, compiling a 14–11 record in 206 innings and batting .374 in 91 at bats. Nevers proved a draw for the Mission team, as Stanford fans and locals from Sonoma County flocked to see Nevers pitch.

In March 1928, Nevers announced that he would not return to professional football that fall, opting instead to serve as an assistant coach to Pop Warner at Stanford. Nevers said of professional football: &quot;I hurt my back last year and don&#x27;t care to take any more chances.&quot; He returned to Stanford in September 1928 as coach of the reserve football players.

In February 1929, Nevers resigned from his coaching job at Stanford to return to the Mission baseball club in the PCL. He appeared in 41 games during the 1929 season and compiled a 7–8 win–loss record.

===Chicago Cardinals===
====1929 season====
In the fall of 1929, Nevers returned to the NFL to play fullback for the Chicago Cardinals. Highlights of Nevers&#x27; 1929 season include the following: 
* On November 6, 1929, he led the Cardinals to a 16–0 victory over the Providence Steam Roller in the first night game in NFL history; in that game, Nevers threw a 45-yard touchdown pass, kicked a 23-yard field goal, and ran for another touchdown. 
* On November 24, 1929, Nevers scored all 19 points (three touchdowns and an extra point) in the Cardinals&#x27; 19–0 victory over the Dayton Triangles, who were playing in their final game before moving to Brooklyn to embark on their long and erratic history through the league. 
* Four days later on November 28, 1929, Nevers set an NFL record for points scored by a player in a single game. Nevers scored all 40 points in the Cardinals&#x27; 40–6 victory over the Chicago Bears; in that game, Nevers scored six rushing touchdowns, which remained an unshared NFL record until Alvin Kamara also accomplished the feat on Christmas Day, 2020 against the Minnesota Vikings. Nevers also kicked four extra points in the same game.
* On December 1, 1929, in a narrow loss to the New York Giants, Nevers threw a touchdown pass, intercepted a Benny Friedman pass and returned it to the Giants&#x27; one-yard line, rushed for a touchdown, and kicked an extra point.
* On December 8, 1929, Nevers passed for two touchdowns, ran for a touchdown, and kicked two extra points in a 26–0 victory over the Orange Tornadoes.

At the end of the 1929 season, Nevers was a consensus pick as the fullback on the 1929 All-Pro Team, receiving first-team honors from the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;, based on the return of 16 ballots sent to the team owners, managers, and sports writers of clubs in the NFL, &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot; magazine, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

====1930 season====
In 1930, Nevers returned to the Cardinals as both head coach and fullback. Highlights of his 1930 season included:
* On October 25, 1930, Nevers rushed for two touchdowns and kicked four extra points in a 34–7 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets.
* On October 26, 1930, Nevers accounted for all 23 points in a 23–13 victory over the Portsmouth Spartans. In that game, Nevers threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Cobb Rooney, ran for two touchdowns, and kicked a field goal and two extra points. In a single weekend, with back-to back games against Frankford and Portsmouth, Nevers accounted for four rushing touchdowns, a passing touchdown, a field goal, and six extra points.
* On November 16, 1930, Nevers led the Cardinals to a 13–6 victory over the 1930 NFL champion Green Bay Packers. The victory broke the Packers&#x27; 22-game winning streak. Nevers threw a touchdown pass to Bunny Belden, ran for a touchdown, and converted one of two extra point attempts to account for all of the Cardinals&#x27; points.
At the end of the 1930 season, Nevers was again selected as the consensus first-team fullback on the 1930 All-Pro Team with Bronko Nagurski being picked for the second-team at the position.

====1931 season====
Nevers returned to the Cardinals as fullback and head coach in 1931. Highlights of his seasons included:
* On November 1, 1931, Nevers led the Cardinals to a 14–7 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Nevers averaged 52 yards on his punts in the game, threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Kassell, rushed for a touchdown, and kicked two extra points.
* On November 15, 1931, the Cardinals defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21–13, giving the Packers their first loss of the year. Nevers threw two touchdown passes and kicked three extra points in the game. The Associated Press called it &quot;one of [Nevers&#x27;] greatest exhibitions&quot;. The Packers went on to win the 1931 NFL championship. 
* On November 22, 1931, Nevers ran for two touchdowns and kicked two extra points as the Cardinals defeated the Portsmouth Spartans, 20–19.
* In his final NFL game, played before a crowd of 1,500 at Wrigley Field on November 29, 1931, Nevers led the Cardinals to a 21–0 victory over the Cleveland Indians. Nevers accounted for every point scored in the game with a 44-yard touchdown pass to Malloy, two rushing touchdowns, and three extra points.

At the end of the 1931 season, Nevers was again selected (for the fifth time in five years in the NFL) as the fullback on the All-Pro Team, receiving first-team honors from the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; based on the returns of ballots sent to each club in the league as well as sports writers and officials, the United Press, and &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

On January 25, 1932, Nevers broke his wrist on the final play of a charity football game in San Francisco. Afterward, Nevers announced his retirement as a player, stating that he was getting out while he was &quot;still in one piece,&quot; and expressing a desire to pursue a career as a coach.

==Coaching career==
In March 1932, Nevers was hired as an assistant coach under Pop Warner at Stanford. His initial assignment was to coach the &quot;goof squad&quot;. At the end of the 1932 season, Warner resigned as Stanford&#x27;s head coach, but Nevers remained as an assistant coach under Tiny Maxwell through the 1935 season. During that time, Stanford won three consecutive Pacific Coast Conference championships and played in the 1934, 1935, and 1936 Rose Bowls.

In January 1936, Nevers resigned his position at Stanford to accept the head coaching job at Lafayette College. Nevers was welcomed to the Easton, Pennsylvania, campus with a parade and street celebration as classes were suspended for the day and Lafayette students anticipated the school&#x27;s &quot;return to &#x27;Big Time&#x27; position&quot; of previous years. The 1936 Lafayette team compiled a 1–8 record.

In March 1937, Nevers resigned his post at Lafayette upon being appointed backfield and ends coach for the University of Iowa under head coach Irl Tubbs. Tubbs had been Nevers&#x27; high school football coach in Superior, Wisconsin. Nevers coached at Iowa for two years during which time the team compiled records of 1–7 in 1937 and 1–6–1 in 1938.

In December 1938, after the Chicago Cardinals had compiled a 2–9 record during the 1938 season, Nevers was hired as the team&#x27;s head coach. The 1939 Cardinals compiled a 1–10 record. In February 1940, Nevers resigned from the Cardinals, saying he wished to reside permanently in San Francisco.

==Awards and honors==
Nevers received numerous honors and awards during and after his playing career, including the following:

* In 1925, the football field at Santa Rosa High School was renamed Nevers Field in his honor.
* After Nevers left Stanford, his jersey (No. 1) was retired by the football program. It was Stanford&#x27;s only retired number for more than 50 years until Jim Plunkett&#x27;s number was also retired.
* In 1931, a committee of 12 leading football coaches led by Pop Warner met to determine the greatest football player of all time. Nevers finished in a tie with Red Grange for second place behind only Jim Thorpe. Warner actually picked Nevers first and noted: &quot;Ernie Nevers played his position by far the best of any player I ever saw. He had a wonderful physique – was big and powerful yet very active. Nevers was the mental type every coach likes to have on his football team. He was a fine punter, a fine forward passer, a great line plunger and a marvel on defense. Ernie Nevers was a football player without fault.&quot;
* In April 1951, Nevers was selected as the fullback on the all-time All-America team selected in a nationwide poll by the Associated Press as part of the process to select nominees for the National Football Hall of Fame.
* In November 1951, Nevers was selected as one of the inaugural inductees for the National Football Hall of Fame (later renamed the College Football Hall of Fame).
* In 1962, he was selected by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as the best college football player of all time.
* In 1963, Nevers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its charter class.
* In 1969, at the time of college football&#x27;s centennial, Nevers was selected at fullback on college football&#x27;s all-time All-America teams selected by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and &quot;Football News&quot;. He was also named that same year to the National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team.
* In 1979, Nevers was selected as one of the inaugural inductees (along with Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Bill Russell) into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.
* In 2003, he was honored by the United States Postal Service as one of four players (along with Red Grange, Walter Camp, and Bronko Nagurski) to be featured on a postage stamp as early gridiron heroes.
* In 2010, the NFL Network ranked Nevers 89th on its list of the 100 greatest players of all time.

==Family, military service, and later years==
Nevers was married to Mary Elizabeth &quot;Mae&quot; Heagerty in February 1926 in San Francisco.

On August 20, 1938, Nevers served as an official for a golf match at Duluth, Minnesota, between blind golfers Clinton F. Russell of Duluth and Dr. W. H. I. Oxenham of England, both of whom had been featured in Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!.

In September 1942, Nevers enlisted at age 39 in the United States Marine Corps; he was given the rank of captain. In the spring of 1943, he was stationed at the Olds Gunnery School in Lansing, Michigan. While Nevers was stationed at a Marine base in Santa Barbara, California, his wife became ill with pneumonia; she died in a San Francisco hospital in July 1943. Nevers left for the South Pacific theater of World War II in October 1943. In April 1944, he was reported by the Associated Press to have been stationed for the past several months with a marine amphibious unit in the Pacific. In October 1944, Nevers returned to San Francisco after spending 10 months in charge of ground personnel with a squadron in the South Pacific. In December 1944, while stationed at Naval Station Treasure Island in San Francisco, Nevers was promoted to the rank of major. In February 1945, he became the athletic officer at the Marine Corps base in San Diego.

At the end of February 1945, Nevers agreed to serve as an assistant coach with the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference upon his discharge from the Marine Corps. As of mid-May 1945, Nevers was awaiting his discharge papers and had become associated with a trucking company pending the commencement of his coaching duties with the Rockets. Nevers ultimately served in the fall of 1946 as the backfield coach for the Rockets.

Nevers was remarried to Margery Luxem Railton of Chicago in February 1947. It was the second marriage for both. They had a daughter, Tina (born May 1948), Ernie Nevers also had a son, Gene Sullivan (born Aug 1947).

After retiring from football, Nevers lived in Strawberry and then Tiburon, both in Marin County, California, and worked in public relations and sales promotion for a wine association and a wholesale liquor company. In 1950, Nevers and his wife had a television show broadcast on Friday nights on KGO in San Francisco. In September 1954, Nevers began another television show known as &quot;Out on a Limb With Ernie Nevers&quot;.

Nevers died in May 1976 at age 73 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, California. Press accounts differed as to the cause of his death, one indicating that he had been suffering from a kidney disorder, and another saying he had been under treatment for a heart condition. He was buried at Mount Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael, California.

<text>Virgin Mobile is a wireless communications brand used by seven independent brand-licensees worldwide. Virgin Mobile branded wireless communications services are available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Poland and Mexico. Virgin Mobile branded services used to be offered in Australia, France, Singapore, India, Qatar, South Africa and the United States.

Each Virgin Mobile branded entity acts independently from the others, thus the handsets, service plans and network radio interfaces vary from country to country. In a given country, the Virgin Mobile wireless entity is typically a partnership between Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group and an existing mobile network operator or mobile virtual network operator (MVNO).

==Current brand license holders==

===Virgin Mobile Ireland===
Virgin Mobile Ireland was launched in 2015, at the same time UPC Ireland was rebranded Virgin Media Ireland. Both Virgin Mobile UK and Virgin Mobile Ireland are operated by Virgin Media Limited, a subsidiary of Liberty Global.

===Virgin Mobile KSA (Saudi Arabia)===
Virgin Mobile KSA is a telecommunication company operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It offers both pre-paid and post-paid plans through over 20,000 sale points in the country. Its offering targets mainly younger population, with flexible price plans and bundles.

On 22 March 2021, STC Kuwait and Virgin Mobile Middle East and Africa (VMMEA) received the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority’s approval for the first MVNO licence in Kuwait. They will launch Virgin Mobile Kuwait using STC’s network, with STC acting as a host facilities provider.
===Virgin Mobile Latin America===
====Virgin Mobile Chile====
Virgin Mobile Latin America (VMLA) launched operations in Chile in April 2012, after receiving regulatory approval from Chile&#x27;s telecommunications regulator and signing an agreement with Movistar, one of the country&#x27;s leading mobile network operators. VMLA announced in June of this year its plan to become Latin America&#x27;s leading mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). Since then, the company has made significant progress towards its goal of beginning commercial operations in many countries. Chile was its first commercial operation in early 2012. Richard Branson commented: &quot;We are excited to have made such good progress towards launching our first mobile business in Latin America in Chile. This is an exciting project for Virgin and we believe Virgin Mobile Chile customers will be delighted by the services we will be offering them at launch. We are very appreciative of Subtel’s (Chile’s Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones) prompt approval of our application,&quot; said VMLA&#x27;s chairman Phil Wallace.

Virgin Mobile won for three consecutive years the ALCO Customer Loyalty award for having the highest net promoter score (NPS) index in the telecommunications industry in Chile. As of January 2016 Virgin Mobile Chile has a net portability balance of 322,560 customers that have transferred their phone numbers from or to other companies. This figure does not include &quot;non-ported&quot; customers that started with a new phone number.

====Virgin Mobile Colombia====
Colombia was the second South American country that received the Virgin Mobile network. It launched officially plans and services on 3 April 2013, working with Movistar&#x27;s electromagnetic frequency. The high rate of active mobile lines in Colombia makes this country a good place to set telecom and networks operations. Virgin Mobile took advantage of the 4G spectrum auction in Colombia in June 2013 to release more data services with the fastest mobile speed in the world.

====Virgin Mobile Ecuador====
Operations in Ecuador were rumored to start in 2017, using Movistar&#x27;s network.

Richard Branson (Virgin Mobile CEO) and Ecuadorian president Lenín Moreno met in NY and signed the agreement.

====Virgin Mobile Mexico====
In early 2014, Virgin Mobile Latin America&#x27;s site for Virgin Mobile Mexico was launched. Since 10 April 2014, it has been possible to purchase micro, nano and regular sim cards through several points of sale located in shopping malls or over the internet. They have reached an agreement to use Movistar&#x27;s network. In April 2014 they only offered basic prepaid service (voice SMS Data) on a pay-as-you-go basis, and were expected to introduce more diverse offers soon. In June 2016 Virgin Mobile Mexico started to offer LTE access using Band 2.

===Virgin Plus===
Virgin Plus (formerly Virgin Mobile Canada) experienced substantial growth in 2008, launching approximately 60 &#x27;Virgin Mini Stores&#x27; (VMS) across the country.

Power and Associates&#x27; annual award for &quot;Highest Customer Satisfaction for Prepaid Wireless&quot;. Post-paid plans were introduced to Virgin Canada in February 2008.

Bell Mobility acquired Virgin Plus in May 2009 for CAN$142 million. Some of its stores in Ontario and Quebec are operated by the largest Bell franchise, Cellcom Communications. In early 2010, Virgin Plus launched the iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 post-paid service in Virgin Plus Retail Stores and online, all around Canada. Virgin Plus became the fifth brand offering the iPhone in Canada, after Fido, Rogers Wireless, Telus, and Bell Mobility.

===Virgin Mobile Poland===

==Former brand license holders==

===Virgin Mobile Australia===
Virgin Mobile Australia (VMA) was a telecommunications company based in Sydney, Australia. They sold through over 73 retail outlets, including flagship stores in Perth, Sydney, Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane, as well as via telesales and an online store. Virgin Mobile Australia operated on the Optus network.

On 30 May 2018, Optus announced that they would be phasing out the Virgin Mobile brand and would transfer Australian Virgin Mobile customers over to Optus. They said the phase out would take them roughly two years. On 15 June 2018, Virgin stopped selling all prepaid and postpaid mobile plans to customers. In June 2020 Virgin Mobile announced that they were temporarily extending the closure of Virgin Mobile Australia to 30 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic to help customers stay connected.

===Virgin Mobile France===
Virgin Mobile France was a mobile virtual network operator in France that began as a subsidiary of Virgin Group.

Launched in France on 3 April 2006, Virgin Mobile was the fifth mobile operator on the French market and the first MVNO by number of subscribers, with over 2 million customers. Chaired by Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, Virgin Mobile was commercialized by OMEA TELECOM, a joint venture between Virgin Group and Carphone Warehouse before it was bought in 2015 by the French communication group SFR.

===Virgin Mobile India===
On 1 March 2008, Virgin launched the Mobile brand in India through a franchise arrangement with NTT DoCoMo. This was Virgin&#x27;s seventh launch globally and its largest. However, on 29 March 2008, the Department of Telecom (DoT) cleared the deal after clarification from Tata Teleservices indicated that Virgin had not entered India as an MVNO.

Tata Teleservices merged the company into its existing Tata DoCoMo service on 27 March 2015.

===Virgin Mobile Peru===
Virgin Mobile had a short venture in Peru where they failed to achieve the 2% market share they targeted, and the first MVNO from the Peruvian mobile market was eventually sold to another company: Inkacel of Spain.

===Virgin Mobile Qatar===
Was introduced as a secondary brand for QTel Qatar Telekom, but, after a process with Vodafone Qatar, Qtel renounced to the Virgin Mobile brand and eventually merged with the original brand name.

===Virgin Mobile Singapore===
Virgin Singapore was launched in October 2001 as a joint venture with Singtel. The operations were closed down on 11 October 2002 after failing to attract a significant number of customers.

Failure of the joint venture was attributed to a saturated mobile market and Virgin Mobile&#x27;s positioning as a &quot;premium&quot; brand.

===Virgin Mobile South Africa===
Virgin Mobile South Africa (VMSA) is a joint-venture between Sir Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group and Cell C. Virgin Mobile South Africa launched in 2006. In February 2011 it was reported that Cell C&#x27;s 50% stake in Virgin Mobile is to be sold to Virgin Group of the UK and Calico Investments of the Bahamas. Virgin Mobile closed in South Africa on 17 September 2021 after 15 years operation.

===Virgin Mobile UK===
Virgin Mobile UK was a mobile virtual network operator, and a division of Virgin Media O2 (joint-owned by Liberty Global and Telefónica). Virgin Mobile UK was the world&#x27;s first mobile virtual network operator which launched in 1999, and later became part of NTL Telewest. It originally used the coverage of network operator One2One, which later became T-Mobile UK, and then EE. 

In 2019, Virgin Mobile UK signed an agreement to move from EE to the Vodafone network. However, it later gave notice of plans to terminate the Vodafone deal in its Q2 2021 financial report, due to Telefónica (owners of O2) acquiring 50% of the business. Network traffic was moved to the O2 network during 2022, and in January 2023, Virgin Media O2 announced that the Virgin Mobile UK brand would close. In August 2023, the transfer of Virgin Mobile UK network users to the O2 network was completed. Virgin Mobile UK no longer offers new services, however existing customers still remain legally contracted to Virgin Mobile UK, with O2 providing their services.

===Virgin Mobile USA===

Virgin Mobile USA was a no-contract mobile virtual network operator owned by Sprint Corporation. It licensed the Virgin Mobile brand from United Kingdom-based Virgin Group. Virgin Mobile USA was headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and provided service to approximately 6 million customers.

Founded in 2001 as a joint venture between Virgin Group and Sprint Corporation, Virgin Mobile USA commenced operations in June 2002 as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), providing services via the Sprint 1900 MHz CDMA network. In 2009, Sprint Nextel bought out joint-venture partner Virgin Group, becoming the sole owner of Virgin Mobile USA.

In June 2017, Virgin Mobile dropped all Android and began to only offer iPhones to new customers under its new &quot;Inner Circle&quot; unlimited plan. Following the discontinuation of the plan in 2018, it began to restore Android devices to its line-up.

In January 2020, Virgin Mobile announced that it would shut down, and transfer its remaining customers to its sister brand Boost Mobile the following month.

<text>Carrie Chapman Catt (born Carrie Clinton Lane; January 9, 1859 – March 9, 1947) was an American women&#x27;s suffrage leader who campaigned for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave U.S. women the right to vote in 1920. Catt served as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association from 1900 to 1904 and 1915 to 1920. She founded the League of Women Voters in 1920 and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1904, which was later named International Alliance of Women. She &quot;led an army of voteless women in 1919 to pressure Congress to pass the constitutional amendment giving them the right to vote and convinced state legislatures to ratify it in 1920&quot;. She &quot;was one of the best-known women in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century and was on all lists of famous American women.&quot;

== Early life ==
Carrie Clinton Lane was born on January 9, 1859, in Ripon, Wisconsin, the daughter of Maria Louisa ( Clinton) and Lucius Lane. When Catt was seven years old, her family moved to rural Charles City, Iowa. As a child, Catt was interested in science and wanted to become a doctor. After graduating from high school in 1877, she enrolled at Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) in Ames, Iowa.
Catt&#x27;s father was initially reluctant to allow her to attend college, but he relented, contributing only a part of the costs. To pay her expenses, Catt worked as a dishwasher, in the school library, and as a teacher at rural schools during school breaks. Her freshman class consisted of 27 students, six of whom were female. Catt joined the Crescent Literary Society, a student organization aimed at advancing student learning skills and self-confidence. Although only men were allowed to speak extemporaneously in meetings, Catt demanded to be allowed to do the same thing. This started a discussion about women&#x27;s participation in the group and ultimately led to women gaining the right to speak in meetings. Catt was also a member of Pi Beta Phi, started an all girls&#x27; debate club, and advocated for women&#x27;s participation in military drills.

After four years at Iowa State, Catt graduated on November 10, 1880, with a Bachelor of Science degree, the only female in her graduating class. Iowa State did not name valedictorians during Catt&#x27;s time there, so there is no way to know her class rank. 

She first worked as a law clerk after graduating. She became a teacher and quickly advanced, becoming superintendent of schools in Mason City, Iowa, in 1885. She was the first female superintendent of the district.

==Marriage==
In February 1885, Catt married newspaper editor Leo Chapman. She remained with her parents on the family farm in Iowa when her husband traveled to California to find a job and a place for them to live. Catt left for California after receiving a telegram that her husband was ill with typhoid fever. While she was enroute, Catt learned that her husband died in August 1886. She remained for a while in San Francisco, where she wrote freelance articles and canvassed for newspaper ads, but she returned to Iowa in 1887.

She was a young 28- and 29-year-old widow when she wrote &quot;Zenobia&quot; (1887) and &quot;The American Sovereign&quot; (1888). In 1890, she married George Catt, a wealthy engineer and alumnus of Iowa State University. Catt continued to lecture and wrote the speeches &quot;Subject and Sovereign&quot; in 1893 and &quot;Danger to Our Government&quot; in 1894. George Catt also encouraged her involvement in women&#x27;s suffrage. As a result, she was able to spend a good part of each year on the road campaigning for suffrage, a cause she had become involved with during the late 1880s.

== Role in women&#x27;s suffrage ==

=== National American Woman Suffrage Association ===
==== Early years ====
In 1887, Catt returned to Charles City, where she had grown up, and became involved in the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association. From 1890-1892, Catt served as the Iowa association&#x27;s state organizer and group&#x27;s recording secretary. During her time in office, Catt began working nationally for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), and was a speaker at its 1890 convention in Washington, D.C. In 1892, Susan B. Anthony asked Catt to address Congress on the proposed woman&#x27;s suffrage amendment.

After working her first suffrage campaign in South Dakota in 1890, which went down in defeat, Catt was asked to coordinate the suffrage campaign in Colorado. She arrived in Denver in early September 1893 and worked until Election Day. Catt traveled more than a thousand miles throughout the Rockies during the next two months and visited 29 of Colorado&#x27;s 63 counties. Colorado passed women&#x27;s suffrage in November 1893, becoming the second state to give women the right to vote and the first where suffrage was won by popular vote.

By the 1895 national convention of the NAWSA, Catt was proposing major changes in the structure of the organization. &quot;The great need of the hour is organization. Suffrage is today the strongest reform there is in this country, but it is represented by the weakest organization&quot;, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; reported. &quot;Catt organized and then headed a new Organization Committee with a budget of $5,000 and power so extensive that it became the center of women suffrage in the United States.&quot;

The 1896 NAWSA Convention was notable for its debate about Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, in which Stanton challenged traditional religious beliefs that women are inferior to men and should be passive. Many NAWSA members feared that the book would damage the suffrage movement by alienating its more orthodox members. Catt and Anthony, NAWSA&#x27;s president at the time, met with Stanton prior to its publication to voice their concerns, but Stanton was unmoved. Catt and another future NAWSA president, Anna Howard Shaw, supported a resolution stating that &quot;NAWSA has no official connection with the so-called &quot;Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;.&quot;

During the 1898 national convention of the NAWSA, one of the most outstanding speakers was African American activist Mary Church Terrell. She and Catt first became acquainted at that time and formed a life-long friendship.

==== First presidency, 1900–1904 ====
In 1900, Catt became president of the NAWSA as Susan B. Anthony&#x27;s handpicked successor. Anthony knew Catt had the skills to carry the movement forward and her election to the presidency was nearly unanimous. She served her first term as NAWSA president until 1904, when she stepped down to care for her ailing husband, George Catt, who died in 1905. 

In her first year as NAWSA president, she led a delegation to the 1900 Republican Party national convention, which allowed the suffragists 10 minutes to speak. The Democrats refused to hear them at all. That year in Oregon, a second campaign for woman suffrage failed. During the winter of 1902–1903, Catt worked the New Hampshire amendment campaign in the midst of bitter cold, but lost by a vote of 14,162 to 21,788.

In 1902, Catt called for an international meeting of women that would coincide with the annual convention of NAWSA. Seven of the eight countries with women&#x27;s suffrage sent delegates. Representatives from Chile, Hungary, Russia, Turkey and Switzerland also attended. Vida Goldstein of Australia, Florence Fenwick Miller of England, and Catt together wrote a Declaration of Principles that all the delegates signed that included this statement: &quot;That men and women are born equally free and independent members of the human race; equally endowed with talents and intelligence, and equally entitled to the free exercise of their individual rights and liberty.&quot; This formed the beginning of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, an organization that exists today as the International Alliance for Women.

During the national NAWSA convention held in New Orleans in 1903, Catt and Anthony were attacked by the press for allowing black membership in NAWSA and, in the case of Anthony, for permitting a letter she had written to be read before an all-black audience in New York City. Southern delegates made speeches calling for only white women to have the vote. Catt&#x27;s reply: &quot;We are all of us apt to be arrogant on the score of our Anglo-Saxon blood but we must remember that ages ago the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons were regarded as so low and embruted that the Romans refused to have them for slaves. The Anglo-Saxon is the dominant race today but things may change. The race that will be dominant through the ages will be the one that proves itself the most worthy. ... Miss Kearney is right in saying that the race problem is the problem of the whole country and not that of the South alone. The responsibility for it is partly ours but if the North shipped slaves to the South and sold them, remember that the North has sent some money since then into the South to help undo part of the wrong that it did to you and to them. Let us try to get nearer together and to understand each other&#x27;s ideas on the race question and solve it together.&quot;

==== Second presidency, 1915–1920 ====
Catt was reelected as NAWSA president in 1915, following Shaw&#x27;s presidency. Under her leadership, Catt increased the size and influence of the organization. In 1916, at the NAWSA convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, she unveiled her &quot;Winning Plan&quot;, to &quot;make the Federal Amendment our ultimate aim and work in the States a program of preparedness to win nation-wide suffrage by amendment of the National Constitution.&quot; According to suffragist Maud Wood Park, who was NAWSA&#x27;s chief lobbyist at this time, Catt&#x27;s Winning Plan had four components: First, the states where women had presidential suffrage would lobby their state legislatures to send resolutions to Congress in support of a federal amendment. Second, women living in states where they might secure suffrage by state action would attempt to secure it. Third, suffragists in most states would advocate for presidential suffrage, and fourth, Southern states would advocate for primary suffrage.
Under Catt&#x27;s leadership, the movement focused on success by first working for women&#x27;s suffrage in New York state. Before 1917, only western states had granted female suffrage. After a 1915 campaign failed to win women in New York the right to vote, Catt redoubled her efforts. In 1917 the state approved suffrage. Although Catt, as a resident of New York, had obtained full suffrage, she kept working toward a federal suffrage amendment.

In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson went before a joint session of Congress to request a declaration of war against Germany. Both the Senate and House voted to approve the United States&#x27; entry into World War I. 

Catt made the controversial decision to support the war effort, which shifted the public&#x27;s perception in favor of the suffragists, who were now perceived as patriotic. The suffrage movement received the support of President Wilson in January 1918. On January 10, 1918, the House voted on the suffrage amendment, which passed by one more vote needed for the required 2/3 majority. The following day, Catt wrote all of the state suffrage association presidents asking them to begin work at once to win the votes of the U.S. Senators. The vote in the Senate was finally taken on October 1, 1918, and the proposed amendment lost by two votes. On November 11, 1918, the armistice ending World War I was declared.

During a second vote in the Senate on February 10, 1919, the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment lost by one vote. However, during the 1918 election, suffrage supporters were elected to Congress through targeted efforts by leaders in the movement. The suffrage question came up again before the House on May 21, 1919, and this time it passed by a vote of 304 ayes and 89 nays. The amendment then moved to the Senate, where it passed the needed 2/3 majority by two votes on June 4. Mary Garrett Hay wrote that &quot;CCC danced all over the place and then settled down to THINK.&quot;

Catt led the battle for ratification of the 19th Amendment, which required the approval of 36 state legislatures (3/4 of the then 48 states.) She urged friends of the amendment not to allow it to come to a vote in their state unless they were sure it would pass. However, opponents introduced the bill into their state legislatures. One by one, Southern states voted the measure down: in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina, Delaware, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana and Mississippi. Since the late 19th century, they had passed state amendments that effectively disfranchised African American males. They had no interest in expanding the franchise.

The governors of Connecticut and Vermont refused to call their legislatures into session to vote on the issue. One more state loss and the amendment would be defeated.

The final battle took place in the state of Tennessee. Catt was there to lead the campaign through the hot summer months in Nashville in 1920. She wrote to the &quot;Woman Citizen&quot;, &quot;Never in the history of politics has there been such a force for evil, such a nefarious lobby as labored to block the advance of suffrage in Nashville, Tenn. ... They appropriated our telegrams, tapped our telephones, listened outside our windows and transoms. They attacked our private and public lives.&quot; The vote count was so close that each side believed it could easily be defeated. 

The proposed amendment easily passed the Tennessee Senate, but then moved to the House where – after many delays and many days of debate – it passed by one vote.

At her welcome home reception in New York City, Catt said: &quot;Now that we have the vote let us remember we are no longer petitioners. We are not wards of the nation, but free and equal citizens. Let us do our part to keep it a true and triumphant democracy.&quot; After endless lobbying by Catt and the NAWSA, the suffrage movement culminated in the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920. The 19th Amendment enfranchised 27 million women, making it the largest single expansion of voting rights in American history.

Catt retired from her national suffrage work after the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920. Before she retired, she established the League of Women Voters on February 14, 1920, at the NAWSA national convention in Chicago to encourage women to use their right to vote. In 1923, with Nettie Rogers Shuler, she published &quot;Woman Suffrage and Politics: The Inner Story of the Suffrage Movement&quot;.

=== International women&#x27;s suffrage movement ===
Catt was also a leader of the international women&#x27;s suffrage movement. She helped to found the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in 1902, which eventually incorporated sympathetic associations in 32 nations. She served as its president from 1904 until 1923. After George Catt&#x27;s death in 1905, Catt spent much of the following eight years as IWSA president promoting equal-suffrage rights worldwide. After she retired from NAWSA, she continued to help women around the world to gain the right to vote. The IWSA remains in existence today, now as the International Alliance of Women, with 31 full members and 24 associate members.

Catt first had the idea of an international woman suffrage organization in 1900; by 1902 she decided to begin with an exploratory meeting of women from as many countries as possible. The first meeting of the IWSA was held in Berlin, Germany, with 33 delegates present. Catt was elected president. African American suffragist Mary Church Terrell was one of the delegates from the United States and addressed the meeting in three languages. Each international meeting was held in a different city, membership grew, and successes in women&#x27;s rights were reported and discussed. The international meeting held in Budapest in 1913 was the largest in the history of the organization, with 500 delegates attending. The world&#x27;s press had 230 representatives and 2,800 visitors came to listen and learn.

Following her first term as president of NAWSA, Catt engaged in international suffrage work from 1906 to 1913. On a single trip around the world from departure from New York on April 1, 1911, to arrival in San Francisco on November 4, 1912, Catt spoke and/or organized women&#x27;s suffrage organizations in South Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Pretoria and a Kaffir kraal in Maritzburg); up the east coast of Africa to Zanzibar, Tanzania and Port Said; Egypt; then on to Jericho, Jordan, Riyaq and Beirut, Lebanon, and to Cairo, where she departed for Ceylon; then India, starting in Agra and leaving the continent in Rangoon, Myanmar (Burma). From there, it was on to Java, Sumatra, Jakarta, Indonesia, the island of Sulawesi and the Philippines. One of the last countries on Catt&#x27;s travels was China, where she visited Hong Kong, Shanghai, Peking, Nanking, and Hankow. She then traveled to Korea, Japan, Hawaii, and across the Pacific back to San Francisco.

Due to the outbreak of World War I, 1913 would be the last meeting of the IWSA for some years. Three days after the armistice ending the war in 1918, Catt planned to resume the meetings of the IWSA. The 1920 meeting took place in Geneva and more than 400 women met, including delegates from Germany, France, Japan, China, India and the United States. The board asked women of the enfranchised countries to help further the vote in countries without the vote. The United States was to organize efforts in Jamaica, Cuba and South America, which was the only continent where no women had the vote. A member of the League of Woman Voters suggested that a Pan-American conference be held in 1922. After three days of round-table discussions, Catt had organized the Pan-American Association for the Advancement of Women (National Liga para la Emancipacion de la Mujer). Its objectives included educational opportunities for women, the right to have equal guardianship with husbands of their children and the right to vote.

The following year, Catt traveled to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru and Panama. She concluded, &quot;I never did a piece of work which has so interested and stimulated my desires to help as this.&quot; While visiting Peru in March 1923, Catt founded the National Council of Women in Action, which lobbied for women&#x27;s suffrage in Peru until they succeeded in 1956. Although Catt retired from the presidency of the IWSA in 1923, she continued to attend its meetings in various parts of the world.

== Catt and the League of Women Voters ==
Catt founded the League of Women Voters on February 14, 1920 – six months before the ratification of the 19th Amendment – during the annual convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Chicago, Illinois. However, she had outlined the purpose and goals of such an organization a year earlier at the 1919 NAWSA meeting in St. Louis, Missouri.

In her presidential address on March 24, 1919, at the NAWSA convention, Catt said: &quot;Let us raise up a League of Women Voters – the name and form of organization to be determined by the voters themselves; a League that shall be non-partisan and non-sectarian in character and that shall be consecrated to three chief aims:

# To use its utmost influence to secure the final enfranchisement of the women of every state in our own Republic and to reach out across the seas in aid of the women&#x27;s struggle for her own in every land.
# To remove the remaining legal discriminations against women in the codes and constitutions of the several states in order that the feet of coming women may find these stumbling blocks removed.
# To make our democracy so safe for the Nation and so safe for the world, that every citizen may feel secure and great men will acknowledge the worthiness of the American Republic to lead.&quot;

In fall 1919, Catt promoted ratification of the 19th Amendment – which had been passed by Congress earlier that year – by the states and explained the purpose of the League of Women Voters on a &quot;Wake Up America&quot; tour. Wearing her refurbished &quot;ratification dress,&quot; Catt spoke at 14 conferences in 13 western and Midwestern states in eight weeks. Her group also met with women and visited state capitals to see governors and other important state officials. By the time of NAWSA&#x27;s &quot;victory convention,&quot; which met February 12–18, 1920, in Chicago, 31 of the required 36 states had ratified the 19th Amendment. The 1920 convention marked the completion of NAWSA&#x27;s work, except for a small board to make final disposition of records and assets, and the beginning of the League of Women Voters.

During the 1920 convention, Catt honored pioneers of the movement – including past NAWSA presidents Anna Howard Shaw and Susan B. Anthony – for their &quot;ever buoyant hope&quot; and &quot;unswerving courage and determination.&quot; She also wanted the convention to &quot;express the joy of the present&quot; and &quot;ask what political parties wanted of women and they of the parties.&quot; In an inspirational speech to the 700 members present, Catt outlined the plan and purpose of the League. She emphasized that its objective was not to seek power in organization, but to &quot;foster education in citizenship and to support legislation.&quot; Every woman was encouraged to become a registered voter and work within the party of her choice. However, she emphasized that &quot;as an organization,&quot; the League &quot;shall be allied with and support no party.&quot; Catt continued that the League &quot;must be nonpartisan and all partisan&quot; in leading the way – ahead of the political parties – to educate for citizenship and get legislation passed.&quot;

At the 1920 convention, the League&#x27;s constitution with details for membership, officers, representation and budget was approved. According to Van Voris, &quot;Catt insisted she did not want to lead the new work, that was for younger and fresher women. ‘For thirty years and a little more, I have worked with you in the first lap of this struggle toward women&#x27;s emancipation,&#x27; she said.&quot; Maud Wood Parks was elected president of the League of Women Voters with Catt accepting the title of &quot;honorary chairman.&quot; Convention delegates also surprised Catt with a brooch consisting of a large sapphire surrounded by diamonds for her &quot;distinguished service.&quot; National&#x27;s parting gift to Catt was funded by thousands of individual contributions – including dimes, nickels and even pennies – from public subscription. Even schoolchildren contributed to the gift.

In addition to the national League, women&#x27;s suffrage organizations in the states also reorganized as state leagues of women voters in 1920. In 2020, the League of Women Voters comprises a national organization and more than 700 state and local leagues in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and Hong Kong. According to its website, Leagues &quot;work year-round to register new voters, host community forums and debates, and provide voters with election information they need. We engage at the local and state levels on legislative priorities and efforts to improve our elections.&quot;

== Role during the world wars ==
Catt was active in anti-war causes during the 1920s and 1930s. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1915, a group of women pacifists in the United States began talking about the need to form an organization to help bring the conflict to an end. On January 10, 1915, more than 3,000 women attended a meeting at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., called by Catt and fellow suffragist Jane Addams. They formed the Women&#x27;s Peace Party, with Addams elected as chairman and Catt as honorary chairman.

On February 25, 1917, by a vote of 63 to 18, NAWSA – with Catt as its president – offered the women&#x27;s services to the government of the United States &quot;in the event they should be needed, and in so far as we are authorized, we pledge the loyal support of our more than two million members.&quot; NAWSA made clear that its work for suffrage would continue since it was &quot;the protective of all other rights.&quot; On April 2, 1917, President Wilson went before Congress to request a declaration of war. The position paper from NAWSA with Catt as its president led to her ejection from the Woman&#x27;s Peace Party as well as hard feelings between her and its small cohort of pacifists.

After the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, granting women in the United States the right to vote, Catt returned to the peace movement. Because she did not want to join any existing organization, Catt and representatives of nine national women&#x27;s organizations founded their own organization, the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War (NCCCW). The group first met in spring 1924 and chose Catt to be its leader. The group divided the causes of war into four categories: psychological, economic, political, and social and contributory. They did not include the exclusion of women from politics and the public sphere as a cause, even though they believed in equality for women. The organization believed that it was their job as women to end wars because women were seen as morally courageous, in contrast to their male counterparts who were viewed as physically courageous.

The NCCCW held its first conference in Washington, D.C., in January 1925, with 450 delegates in attendance. Eleanor Roosevelt attended as a delegate from the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs. Catt told the delegates, &quot;Sooner or later the white races must disgorge some of their spoils and give a place to the other races of the world. We stole land – whole continents; we stole it at the point of swords and guns; and we might as well understand that we must not have an acre to a man while they have an inch to a man. We must leave the door open to whatever arrangements we may make for peace in order that justice can be done to all the races on all the continents.&quot;

In 1932, Catt resigned as chair of the NCCCW, but kept attending meetings, making speeches and supporting the cause of peace. However, she recognized that another war would soon engulf the world. By 1941, when it was clear that the United States would soon enter the war, the NCCCW fell apart. Five of the member organizations had withdrawn and the biennial conference was cancelled for lack of funds. In spring 1943, the NCCCW was dissolved. It was succeeded by the Women&#x27;s Action Committee for Victory and Lasting Peace, which was dedicated to giving support to the idea of the United Nations. According to Jacqueline Van Voris, Catt missed only one NCCCW meeting in its entire existence.

In 1933, in response to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Catt organized the Protest Committee of Non-Jewish Women Against the Persecution of Jews in Germany. The group sent a letter of protest to Hitler in August 1933 signed by 9,000 non-Jewish American women. It decried acts of violence and restrictive laws against German Jews. Catt pressured the U.S. government to ease immigration laws so that Jews could more easily take refuge in America. For her efforts, she became the first woman to receive the American Hebrew Medal. In 1938, Catt was a charter member of the Provisional Council Against Anti-Semitism, to protest acts of anti-Semitism in the United States in light of the persecution of Jews in Germany.

Women&#x27;s advocates abroad were aware of her reputation – in 1938 she was asked to sign an affidavit in support of leading Hungarian feminists Eugénia Meller and Sarolta Steinberger&#x27;s request to emigrate to the U.S. Catt had donated money to a fund that supported the Hungarian Feminist Association financially. She declined the affidavit request, noting that was she was old, had taken much responsibility on behalf of friends and associates, and the affidavit would be held against her estate after her death.

The last event she helped organize was the Women&#x27;s Centennial Congress in New York in 1940, a celebration of the feminist movement in the United States.

== Catt and race ==

=== Nativism and anti-immigration ===
Catt&#x27;s views on race and immigration evolved over her long life. Early in her career, she espoused nativist sentiments. According to Jacqueline Van Voris, Catt began her public life in the 1880s with three speeches, &quot;Zenobia&quot;, &quot;America for Americans&quot;, and &quot;The American Sovereign&quot;. The latter two echoed anti-immigrant sentiments popular at the time.

In the 1890s, when she was active in NAWSA but before becoming president, Catt made public speeches that referred to the &quot;ignorant foreign vote,&quot; and pointed to Native American men&#x27;s lack of knowledge of representative government. Later, Catt noted that the votes of illiterate men in the South were &quot;purchasable&quot;.

In the same speeches, Catt blamed, variously, political corruption, a lack of education, or the tragic vestiges of slavery for these groups&#x27; shortcomings as voters. Her solutions were education and reform, not disenfranchisement. Even as she decried the &quot;ignorant foreign vote&quot;, Catt refers to the &quot;citizens of foreign birth who desire good government&quot;, whose &quot;life and property&quot; are threatened by political machines.

According to Van Voris, &quot;With a century of hindsight it is easy to see Carrie Chapman&#x27;s views in the late 1880s as xenophobic oversimplifications that scapegoat immigrants. Nevertheless, both &#x27;America&#x27; lectures proved popular and were well received by audiences that included dedicated feminists. In part the attraction to these ideas came from the women&#x27;s frustration with the laws that denied them the vote while offering it to immigrant men. Catt&#x27;s dream was of a sober, educated electorate of women and men. Her suspicion of the alien began to dissolve only when she entered international waters a decade later; her dream did not change.&quot;

=== Interracial marriage ===

During the final weeks of the battle for ratification of women&#x27;s suffrage in Tennessee, Catt was spuriously accused by suffrage opponents of supporting interracial marriage, which was illegal in Tennessee, as well as 30 of the 48 states at the time. After she denied making such a statement, Catt said that interracial marriage was &quot;an absolute crime against nature.&quot; According to Elaine Weiss, author of the 2018 book &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote&quot;,Catt was right that mixed-marriage was a toxic topic and woman suffrage could not afford to be in any way associated with it. She&#x27;d never said anything about marriage between the races; the allegation was a calculated lie, manufactured by the Antis and mouthed by their man [Herschel] Candler, but it could still be dangerous. She could not afford it to stand. ... When pressed for the source of his allegations about Catt&#x27;s views on interracial marriage, Candler had to admit he stretched the truth a bit, connected dots in a most haphazard way. He said he&#x27;d based his claim on a published interview with Catt in which she was quoted as saying, &quot;Suffrage knows no bias of race, color or sex.&quot;Similarly, Catt repeated an argument developed in 1867 by abolitionist and suffragist Henry B. Blackwell, when Catt was eight years old, to refute claims by Southern suffrage opponents that women&#x27;s suffrage would undermine white supremacy. Catt expressed this argument most fully in 1917. In her book chapter &quot;Objections to the Federal Amendment.&quot; Catt wrote, &quot;white supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened by women&#x27;s suffrage,&quot; and used 1910 Census data to argue that white voters (men and women) will outnumber black voters (men and women) in all Southern states other than Mississippi and South Carolina. Catt, however, goes on to state that this argument, along with other objections to the federal amendment, are &quot;ridiculous&quot; and states that &quot;all people must be included.&quot;

=== Evolving views on race ===
In September 1917, the NAWSA Executive Board, under Catt&#x27;s leadership, passed a resolution &quot;of some importance,&quot; which stated, &quot;Resolved, That this board set forth its belief in and its stand for that broad type of American democracy that knows no bias on the ground of race, color, creed or sex; to the end that Americans may stand united, not as Irish-Americans, German-Americans, Negro-Americans, Slav-Americans, and &#x27;the women,&#x27; but one and all as Americans for America. In November 1917, Catt called for suffrage for all women in the NAACP&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, stating &quot;the struggle for woman suffrage is not white woman&#x27;s struggle but every woman&#x27;s struggle. ... Everybody counts in applying democracy. And there will never be a true democracy until every responsible and law-abiding adult in it, without regard to race, sex, color or creed has his or her own inalienable and unpurchasable voice in the government. That is the democratic goal toward which the world is striving today.&quot;

As NAWSA President, Catt opposed diluting the 19th Amendment by adding the word &quot;white&quot; or by espousing the alternative Shafroth–Palmer Amendment, which would have allowed states the autonomy to draft suffrage legislation as they saw fit. Similarly, in separate letters written in May 1919, Catt assured the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and two African American suffragists from Kentucky&quot; that NAWSA opposed any effort to limit the vote to white women only.

In her later years, Catt repudiated her earlier nativist statements, calling herself &quot;a regular jingoist&quot;. In her 1909 address to ISWA, Catt stated, &quot;...our task will not be fulfilled until the women of the whole world have been rescued from those discriminations and injustices which in every land are visited upon them in law and custom.&quot; In 1918, when Catt was president, NAWSA lobbied Congress to amend the Hawaii Organic Act to allow the territory to enfranchise women, including Native Hawaiian women. In 1924, Catt condemned the Ku Klux Klan for their racism, antisemitism, and anti-Catholicism.

=== Collaboration with African American suffragists ===
Moreover, NAWSA and its predecessors were integrated organizations and African American suffragists were key allies in Catt&#x27;s campaign to secure the vote in New York. Moreover, Catt&#x27;s Woman Suffrage Party, the leading pro-suffrage organization in the New York, actively sought immigrant support by publishing pro-suffrage literature in 26 languages; hosting rallies in Irish, Syrian, Italian, and Polish enclaves; and establishing committees to reach out to German and French communities. Similarly, in 1919, Catt supported the &quot;Committee on One Hundred&quot; in New York City, which called upon Congress to enforce the 15th Amendment. In the same year, at the founding of the League of Women Voters, Catt called upon the new organization to &quot;To remove the remaining legal discriminations against women in the codes and constitutions of the several states in order that the feet of coming women may find these stumbling blocks removed.&quot;

In 1920, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported on a meeting by the &quot;Woman Voter&#x27;s League&quot;, where Miss Jefferson Bell who, the &quot;Herald&quot; reported, &quot;stated that she, too, had been a worshipper at the shrine of Mrs. Catt until shortly after the ratification when one of her first acts was to appeal to the southern women to assist in seeing that negro women had the right to exercise the franchise.&quot; Similarly, Josephine A. Pearson, the leader of the anti-suffrage lobby during the Tennessee debate, condemned Catt after Tennessee ratified the 19th Amendment, &quot;...I am not sure that this new party spells more serious menace to civilization than the picture, recently, of the great international suffrage leader, Mrs. Catt, marching through the streets of New York, with a negro woman on either side of her! Was she thus proclaiming her ideal of the supremacy of the negro-race that threatens the South, if Federal Suffrage should ever come to us?&quot;

Catt became more outspoken in her opposition to discrimination in the 1920s–1940s, when she was active in the peace movement. For instance, Catt defended Black troops against false charges that they were raping German women during World War I. She also protested a Washington, D.C. hotel&#x27;s policy of excluding African Americans, which precluded them from participating in a NCCCW conference, and spoke out about the plight of Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

== Death and legacy ==

On March 9, 1947, Catt died of a heart attack in her home in New Rochelle, New York. She was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. alongside her longtime companion, Mary Garrett Hay, a fellow New York state suffragist, with whom she lived for more than 20 years. 

African American suffragist Mary Church Terrell memorialized Catt in a telegram: 
&quot;The whole world has lost a great, good, and gifted woman who, for many years, pleaded with it to deal justly with all human beings without regard to sex, race, or religion. Personally, I have lost a dear friend who for forty years has encouraged me by writing and speaking both publicly and privately.&quot; At her funeral, the Reverend Walter Van Kirk praised &quot;the dignity and prestige with which she invested the womanhood of American and of every land.&quot;
=== Honors ===
Catt attained recognition for her work both during and after her lifetime. In 1921, Catt became the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Wyoming. In 1923, Catt was named one of the &quot;12 Greatest Living American Women&quot; by the League of Women Voters and in 1925, she received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Smith College. In 1926, she was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and, in 1930, she received the Pictorial Review Award for her international disarmament work. In 1933, Catt received the American Hebrew Medal; in 1935, the Turkish government issued a stamp to honor her work, and in 1936, she was honored by President Franklin Roosevelt at the White House for her peace activism. In 1940, Catt received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Moravian College for Women, the American Women&#x27;s Association&#x27;s &quot;Woman of the Year Award, and the Gold Medal Pioneer Award from the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs. In 1941, Catt received the Chi Omega award at the White House from her longtime friend Eleanor Roosevelt.

Catt&#x27;s posthumous awards include a stamp that was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring Catt, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott. In 1975, Catt became the first inductee into the Iowa Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. and in 1982, Catt was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1992, the Iowa Centennial Memorial Foundation presented her with The Iowa Award, the state&#x27;s highest honor, and named her one of the ten most important women of the century, and in 2013, Catt was in the first class of women to be honored on the Women of Achievement Bridge in Des Moines, Iowa.

The League of Women Voters often honors Catt as its founder. In 1929, the League placed bronze tablets honoring her contributions to suffrage throughout the country. In 1947, the national League established the Carrie Chapman Catt Memorial Fund, which promoted suffrage aboard, voter education, and the responsibilities of citizenship. In the 1959, this fund was used to sponsor a &quot;Government in Action&quot; program at Syracuse University. The Ames/Story County (Iowa) League has bestowed its Carrie Chapman Catt Award, which recognizes a member&#x27;s contribution to the community, since 1993. The League of Women Voters of Iowa also bestows a Carrie Chapman Catt Award annually, recognizing the significant accomplishments of one of its members. The League of Women Voters of Dane County, which includes Catt&#x27;s birthplace of Ripon, Wisconsin, instituted its Carrie Chapman Catt Award in 2005 and the League of Women Voters of Lake Forest/Lake Bluff (Illinois) has presented its Carrie Chapman Catt Award since 2013.

In 1992, the Charles City, Iowa school district named its alternative high school &quot;Carrie Lane High School&quot; in honor of Catt. In 2019, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate announced the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, which it awards to every Iowa high school that registers to vote at least 90 percent of its eligible student body. Finally, Catt was posthumously named a &quot;Valiant Woman of the Vote&quot; by the National Women&#x27;s History Alliance in 2020.

Museum, Monuments, and Historical Markers

Catt&#x27;s childhood home in Charles City, Iowa has been restored, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is now a museum dedicated to her life and legacy as well as the history of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. It is managed by the nonprofit organization, the National Nineteenth Amendment Society. In 2020 it was added as a site on the National Women&#x27;s Suffrage Trail. The marker was dedicated in 2021. 

On August 26, 2016 (Women&#x27;s Equality Day), a monument commissioned by Tennessee Suffrage Monument, Inc. and sculpted by Alan LeQuire was unveiled in Centennial Park in Nashville, featuring depictions of Catt, Anne Dallas Dudley, Abby Crawford Milton, Juno Frankie Pierce, and Sue Shelton White. Catt is one of three suffragists memorialized with a statue at the Turning Point Suffrage Memorial in Lorton, Virginia, which was dedicated on May 16, 2021.

=== Women&#x27;s voting rights ===
As President of the nation&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s suffrage organization when the 19th Amendment was ratified, women&#x27;s voting rights are part of Catt&#x27;s legacy. The 19th Amendment enfranchised approximately 27 million American women. The amendment extended to women of all races who were not disenfranchised for other reasons. It remains the largest single extension of suffrage in American history. This included three million African American women of voting age, approximately 500,000 of whom lived in the 34 states outside the Deep South. By 1960, the last Census before the Voting Rights Act was passed, more than two million African American women in these 34 states were enfranchised.

In addition, some African American women living in the South were able to register and vote in 1920. According to historian Roslyn Terborg-Penn, &quot;...Black female participation in the elective process during 1920 was extensive enough to occasion a prediction from Georgia State Representative Thomas M. Bell that the Nineteenth Amendment would destroy white supremacy in Georgia since the amendment had enfranchised enough women.&quot; In South Carolina, African American women &quot;apparently took the white male registrars by surprise, and no plan to disqualify them was in effect. Many Black women reported to the registrar&#x27;s office, but the only discrimination was that whites were registered first.&quot;

The 19th Amendment did not prohibit other forms of discrimination against women voters. For instance, no women were allowed to vote in Georgia or Mississippi in 1920 because state legislatures were not called into special session to pass the enabling legislation. Similarly, by the end of the decade, African American women in the South were again disenfranchised by discriminatory laws and practices. Puerto Rican women were not fully enfranchised until 1935. Likewise, Native American women who did not renounce their tribal citizenship were not eligible to vote in 1920 and Chinese American women were not eligible to vote because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which kept Chinese Americans from becoming citizens. This law was in place until 1943. Finally, women of color, especially African American women, continued to experience discrimination until the 24th Amendment, which prohibited poll taxes, and Voting Rights Act were enacted in 1964 and 1965, respectively.

Women&#x27;s voter turnout was approximately 38 percent in 1920, compared to over 65 percent for men. Women&#x27;s voter turnout rates lagged behind men&#x27;s, but gradually rose over time. Women became the numerical majority of voters in 1968 and began to vote at higher rates than men in 1980. By 2016, women&#x27;s voter turnout was 63 percent compared to 53 percent for men, a difference of 10 million voters. Also starting in 1980, men and women&#x27;s vote choices began to diverge, with women being more likely to vote for Democratic candidates and to express support for the Democratic Party. This gender gap is now a durable fixture in American politics, present at the presidential level and in many down ballot races. The largest gender gap was in 2020 with a 12 percentage point advantage to the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. The smallest was four percentage points in 1992, when the Democratic nominee Bill Clinton faced President George H.W. Bush (R) and Independent Ross Perot.

=== At Iowa State University ===
In 1921, Catt became the first woman to deliver a commencement address at Iowa State University when she also received an honorary doctor of laws degree. She was invited to speak again in 1930 and in 1933, received the Iowa State Alumni Association Merit Award for Distinguished Service.

When George Catt died in 1905, he left a donation to Iowa State in his will. However, New York state attorneys determined that the donation was not permissible, since under New York law, bequests could only be awarded to an individual or an incorporated entity. Iowa State, at the time, did not qualify. Consequently, Catt signed over $100,000 in bonds ($ in dollars) to the university to honor George Catt&#x27;s wishes. The George W. Catt Endowment continues to award scholarships to several students in different fields of study each year. Selection is based on academic achievement and financial need. A few years after her husband&#x27;s death, Catt donated another $22,500 to Iowa State and in 1926, donated $6,000 to her sorority, Pi Beta Phi, equivalent to $ in dollars. She also left her personal library of over 1,000 volumes, many on the subject of peace, to the university, along with some furniture and other personal belongings.
Iowa State University named a street, Carrie Lane Court, in Catt&#x27;s honor. As early as 1974, the Government of the Student Body passed a resolution requesting that the new physical education building be named for Catt. The naming committee chair opposed the idea, stating he did not want a &quot;Catt House&quot; on campus. In 1990, the university announced that it was renaming the Old Botany Building as Carrie Chapman Catt Hall and the building was dedicated in 1995 after a $5 million renovation. Naming the building after Catt engendered controversy, with some in the university community objecting to the naming because they said Catt was a racist. In March 2021, the university announced the formation of the Committee on the Consideration of Removing Names from University Property that was considering the renaming of Carrie Chapman Catt Hall. On August 31, 2023, the Committee issued its draft report and initial vote. The committee initially recommended retaining the name of the building. After a sixty-day public comment period, university president Wendy Wintersteen formally accepted the recommendation that the name of Carrie Chapman Catt Hall not be changed.

In 1992, Iowa State University established the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics. The Catt Center conducts research on women in politics, with a special emphasis on Iowa, and promotes civic engagement on campus and in the community. The Catt Center instituted its Carrie Chapman Catt Prize for Research on Women and Politics in 1995 and in 2006 the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences added the Carrie Chapman Catt Public Engagement Award to its roster of alumni awards.

=== Nineteenth Amendment centennial ===
2020 marked the 100th anniversary of the League of Women Voters and the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The League – which includes the national organization founded by Catt on February 14, 1920, as well as more than 700 state and local leagues throughout the United States – is a respected, nonpartisan political organization that continues to educate citizens on key issues of the day and advocates for expansion of access to the ballot for all U.S. citizens.

As part of the centennial celebration of the Nineteenth Amendment in 2020, Catt was featured in newspaper and magazine articles; recent books, such as Elaine Weiss&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote&quot; (2018), which is being made into a film with Hillary Rodham Clinton as the executive producer; the PBS American Experience two-part documentary &quot;The Vote&quot;; and the Iowa PBS documentary, &quot;Carrie Chapman Catt: Warrior for Women.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In March 1883, the month Carrie Lane was promoted to superintendent of schools in Mason City, Iowa, Leo Chapman purchased and began to publish the weekly Mason City Republican newspaper. A supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, he and Lane became engaged and were married at the Lane family home on February 12, 1885. The two began publishing the weekly newspaper as co-editors. In May 1886, having sold the newspaper due to a libel suit, Leo left for San Francisco to find a job in a newspaper while Carrie stayed in Iowa and lived with her parents until he sent word that he had found work and a home for them. In August 1886, Carrie received a telegram that Leo was very ill with typhoid fever and she should come at once. By the time she reached San Francisco on the train, he was dead.

While in San Francisco, she happened to meet George Catt, who was walking behind her on a downtown street. The two had been in college together, and he was about to become the chief engineer for a San Francisco bridge-building firm. In August 1887, Chapman moved back to Iowa, but the two kept in touch. In spring 1890, Chapman took the train to Seattle, Washington, where Catt now lived. On June 10, 1890, the two were married.

Theirs was the deep love of two mature and committed people, each of whom respected the other&#x27;s talents. The newly named Carrie Chapman Catt even told of the arrangement they made before they married, &quot;We made a team to work for the cause. My husband used to say that he was as much a reformer as I, but that he couldn&#x27;t work at reforming and earn a living at the same time; but what he could do was earn living enough for two and free me from all economic burden, and thus I could reform for two. That was our bargain and we happily understood each other.&quot; Both traveled extensively for their work, but also found time to travel together. On October 8, 1905, George Catt died from a perforated ulcer at the age of 45. George Catt had been a successful engineer and his estate left Catt financially independent for the rest of her life.

Catt resided at Juniper Ledge in the Westchester County, New York community of Briarcliff Manor from 1919 through 1928 when she settled in nearby New Rochelle, New York. After George Catt&#x27;s death, Carrie Chapman Catt lived with Mary &quot;Mollie&quot; Garrett Hay, a suffragist leader from New York. Hay was not a part of the international circle of elites that Catt aligned herself with; however, it was understood that they had a special relationship. Catt requested burial alongside Hay, rather than her first husband. Her second husband&#x27;s body was donated to science, according to his wishes. When Hay died in 1928, Alda Wilson moved in with Catt and remained as her secretary until Catt&#x27;s death. Wilson was Catt&#x27;s companion and eventual estate executor, donating six volumes of photographs and memorabilia from Catt&#x27;s estate to Bryn Mawr College.

==In popular culture==
Carrie Chapman Catt is the subject of Barbara Robison&#x27;s &quot;Victory with Valor: A Novel&quot;, a fictionalized account of her life, published in 2020.

The musical is produced in-part by Hillary Clinton and Malala Yousafzai.

Catt is also the subject of a one-woman play, &quot;The Yellow Rose of Suffrage&quot;, by Jane Cox, professor emerita of theatre at Iowa State University. First performed in 1993 by Cox, the play was performed extensively throughout 1995, including at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and has been performed ever since in over 20 states.

Additional theatre projects include &quot;19: The Musical&quot;, conceived and performed by Through the 4th Wall across the Washington, D.C. area in 2019, &quot;The Suffragist&quot; by Nancy Cobb and Cavan Hallman, and &quot;Crusading Mrs. Catt,&quot; a one-woman play written and performed by Lisa Hayes.

Catt was portrayed by Anjelica Huston in the film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; (2004) and is featured in the PBS documentaries &quot;One Woman, One Vote&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Vote,&quot; Part 2 (2020) and in Iowa PBS&#x27;s &quot;Carrie Chapman Catt: Warrior for Women&quot; (2020), which received a regional Emmy Award. In 2021, Catt was featured in an art exhibit &quot;Imposter Files for the Recovery of the Memory and History of Peruvian Women&quot;.

<text>Tancredo de Almeida Neves () (4 March 1910 – 21 April 1985) was a Brazilian politician, lawyer, and entrepreneur. He served as Minister of Justice and Internal Affairs from 1953 to 1954, President of the Council of Ministers from 1961 to 1962, Minister of Finance in 1962, and as Governor of Minas Gerais from 1983 to 1984. He was elected President of the Republic in 1985, but died before taking office.

He began his political career with the Progressistas (PP) of Minas Gerais, for whom he served as city councilman of São João del Rei from 1935 to 1937. He received the majority of votes and became President of the Municipal Legislature. He was elected state representative (1947–1950) and congressman (1951–1953) as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). He took office in June 1953, acting as Minister of Justice and Internal Affairs until the suicide of President Getúlio Vargas.

In 1954 Neves was elected congressman and served for one year. From 1956 to 1958 he was director of Banco de Crédito Real de Minas Gerais and President of Carteira de Redescontos of Banco do Brasil from 1956 to 1958. From 1958 to 1960 he headed the Department of Finance of Minas Gerais. Neves was nominated President of the Council of Ministers after President Jânio Quadros resigned and the introduction of the Parliamentary Regime in 1961 and was re-elected congressman in 1963.

He was a leader of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), a political party created on 27 October 1965 through the Institutional Act Number Two (AI-2) which abolished all existing parties and the institution of bi-partisanship. He was later re-elected congressman several times between 1963 and 1979. After the re-institution of a multiparty system Neves became a senator as a member of the MDB in 1978 and founded the Popular Party (PP) with which he continued to serve until 1982. He joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) the following year and was elected governor of Minas Gerais where he served from 1983 to 1984. During this period, there was great political turmoil in favour of the movement known as , a civil action that mobilized the youth and proclaimed direct elections for president. But with the defeat of the &quot;Dante de Oliveira amendment&quot;, which would have mandated direct elections for president in 1984, Neves was chosen to represent the Democratic Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties.

In 1984, Neves ran for president with the help of Ulysses Guimarães, and was elected President of Brazil on 15 January 1985 by the indirect voting of an electoral college. However, Neves fell gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration, 14 March 1985, and died 38 days afterwards. He died of diverticulitis and never assumed his position as president. While still ill, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Military Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of the Valour, Loyalty and Merit. Although he died before taking his post as president his name has been included in the gallery of Brazilian presidents according to law nº 7.465/1986, passed on the first anniversary of his death. Neves was the last Mineiro (from the State of Minas Gerais) President to be elected in the 20th century.

Neves was one of the most important Brazilian politicians in the 20th century and one of the major statesmen of Brazilian history. In July 2012 he was elected one of the 100 Greatest Brazilians of All Time in a competition organized by Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão (SBT) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

==Early life and career==
Tancredo Neves was born at 3:30 BRT on 4 March 1910 in São João del-Rei, Minas Gerais and was of mostly Portuguese, but also Austrian descent and graduated in law. The Neves family name comes from an Azorean great-great-grandfather. Tancredo Neves was a descendant of Amador Bueno, a noted paulista from the colonial Brazilian era.

His parents were Francisco de Paula Neves and Antonina de Almeida Neves. After completing studies in his hometown, he moved to Belo Horizonte and enrolled in Law School. He was a sympathizer of the Liberal Alliance that had brought Getúlio Vargas to power with the outbreak of the 1930 Revolution.

Neves studied at Colégio Santo Antônio, a Franciscan school, concluding his studies in humanities in 1927. In 1928 he began studies at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais where he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Law, in 1932 and was a public prosecutor in 1933.

He began his political career as a member of the legislative chamber of his hometown in 1934, and was elected in 1947 to the Minas Gerais state legislature. Three years later he became a representative of his state in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. In 1953 he was appointed Minister of Justice by President Getúlio Vargas. Neves served in that post until Vargas committed suicide in 1954. In 1960, Neves ran unsuccessfully for governor of Minas Gerais.

Neves was married to Risoleta Guimarães Tolentino and they had three children. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Coimbra, and was called &quot;Doctor Tancredo&quot; by his close colleagues. He is the grandfather of Aécio Neves, who was Minas Gerais&#x27;s governor between 2003 and 2010 and is currently a senator.

==Early political career==
During the Old Republic, Neves opposed Artur Bernardes, president of Brazil. He was launched into politics through the municipal political leader Augusto Viegas, to whom he remained grateful. In 1984, when asked about the political parties he belonged to by the newspaper &quot;Pasquim&quot;, he explained that he had chosen his parties, like everyone from Minas Gerais did, according to municipal issues.

He joined the Progressive Party (PP) of Minas Gerais, party which was formed by members of the Mineiro Republican Party, who supported the Revolution in 1930. Later, when the Progressive Party was extinct, he joined the Mineiro Nationalist Party.

Neves was not able to finance his candidacy as state representative in 1934, but he was elected São João del Rei&#x27;s city councilman in 1935 and president of the City Council when he became the mayor. After the closure of the municipalities and the institution of the &quot;New State&quot; on 10 November 1937, Neves was the President of São João del Rei&#x27;s Board of Councilmen.

After concluding his term of office as city councilman, Neves returned to advocacy and was an attorney for his city&#x27;s railway union. He was also an entrepreneur in the textile sector for some time. According to the newspaper &quot;Pasquim&quot;, Governor Benedito Valadares invited him to become chief of police in Belo Horizonte, but declined, saying he would not serve dictatorships.

==State legislator and federal minister==
Feeling pressured by the international conjuncture dictated by the imminent victory of the allies during World War II, and susceptible to internal pressure and contestation, President Getúlio Vargas cranked up a stratagem to liberate the New State. With that, the political framework that had been erected under auspicious democrats saw a new political college emerge.

On 8 April 1945, the Social Democratic Party (PSD) was created in Minas Gerais and was controlled by Benedito Valadares, who had been nominated as federal intervener of Minas Gerais on 15 December 1933. He governed until Getúlio Vargas was deposed on 29 October 1945. His fall opened way to the elections for president of the republic and for members of the National Constituent Assembly on 2 December of the same year. The Assembly proclaimed the new Constitution on 18 September 1946. Once the Constitution was in force, there were elections for state governor and members of the National Congress and state legislature in January 1947.

Neves was elected Minas Gerais&#x27; state representative by Benedito Valadare&#x27;s PSD, and was designated as one of the spokesmen of the state Constitution of Minas Gerais. Once his work with the Constituent Assembly was over, he assumed leadership of the Social Democratic Party workbench and led the opposition to Milton Campos&#x27; government. Milton Campos was part of the National Democratic Union (UDN), which had reached the Liberty Palace after a split in the PSD of Minas Gerais. Due to a fire in the building of the old Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais, very few documents of that Constituent Assembly were left intact.

He was elected congressman in 1950, and Juscelino Kubitschek was elected Governor of Minas Gerais, defeating situationist . In 1953, Kubitschek and Vargas agreed to appoint Neves minister of justice of Minas Gerais, a post which had to be filled by a delegate of the PSD of Minas Gerais. Neves left the parliamentary seat and began to serve as Minister of Justice on 26 June 1953. During his office, two laws were sanctioned, the Law 2.083 (the &quot;Press Law&quot;) in 1953 and Law 2.252 on statutory rape.

As Minister of Justice during Vargas&#x27; administration, Neves offered to take on the Cabinet of War, which was responsible for arresting rebel military and to head the democratic resistance.

As Minister of Justice, he opened investigations into several cases of torture and exploitation of minors. He closed the Service of Assistance to Minors (SAM) after journalist Villas-Boas Corrêa&#x27;s denunciation. He visited the location with the journalist in the middle of the night. He ordered that the doors be broken open, and they found inside the place dirty beds and girls who were &quot;piled up as rags&quot; and had injuries. Without hesitation, the very next day, Neves ordered the place to be closed for investigations and renovation.

He resigned as minister after Vargas&#x27; suicide on 24 August 1954, twenty days after the assault against journalist Carlos Lacerda. The incident resulted in the death of Major Rubens Florentino Vaz of the Brazilian Air Force, and generated a great political crisis. Café Filho then took office as President.

According to the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, Neves would have received a copy of Vargas&#x27;s Testament-letter, which would be revealed at the time of his death. But, Leonel Brizola&#x27;s version of the story is different, according to him, it was João Goulart who received it and who read it at Vargas&#x27; funeral in São Borja. Neves was giften a Parker-21 fountain pen by Vargas, since then been passed down to his grandson, Aécio Neves, former Governor of Minas Gerais.

Journalist Pedro Jorge de Castro narrated in his book &quot;Carlos Castelo Branco – Brazil&#x27;s Journalist&quot;, the episode about the fountain pen, saying that once the meeting with the ministers was over, Vargas went up to his apartment at the Catete Palace and then turned to bid goodbye to Minister of Justice, Neves, and gave him the gold Parker-21 pen, and said before taking his life: &quot;To the sure friend, in unsure times.&quot;

Benedito Valadares, Juscelino Kubitschek and Getúlio Vargas were Neves&#x27;s main mentors in politics. Neves remained loyal to Vargas&#x27;s memory, opposing João Café Filho&#x27;s administration, and was one of the people who articulated Juscelino Kubitschek&#x27;s candidacy as president, in the 1955 elections. Because he had not left his post in Vargas&#x27;s ministry, Neves did not run for re-election as congressman in October 1954. He was nominated President of Credit Bank of Minas Gerais by Governor Clóvis Salgado da Gama.

In 1956 Juscelino Kubitschek nominated Neves for the &quot;carteira de redesconto&quot; (board of directors) of the Bank of Brazil, which he was a part of until 1958, when he was nominated secretary of Treasury under Bias Fortes&#x27; administration. Taking the post as Secretary of Finance, which he served until 1960, fact that stopped Neves from running the legislative elections in 1958. He then left the post in order to run for governor of Minas Gerais, but was defeated by José de Magalhães Pinto of the National Democratic Union.

==President of the Council of Ministers==

On 25 August 1961, Neves pronounced the installation of parliamentarism; therefore, preventing João Goulart from assuming the Presidency under a Military Coup. After more than a week of uncertainty, all the sectors directly involved in the crisis concluded that the solution to the dead-lock would have to be political and not military. So, with the developing negotiations, a constitutional amendment was presented, that would convert the presidencialist regime to a parliamentary one. This change greatly reduced the President&#x27;s power, and was considered satisfactory by the military officers. Neves then travelled to Montevideo in order to obtain Goulart&#x27;s agreement, and returned to Brasília on 1 September, having fulfilled his mission. The amendment was approved by Congress on the 2nd and opened way to Goulart&#x27;s return, assuming the Presidency on september 7th, independence day.

On the following day, the new president sent a message to the National Congress (which was approved with 259 votes against 22), that designated Neves as President of the Council of Ministers, thus head of the brazilian government.

The first Council of Ministers aimed to build a vast political structure, and which was able to regain dialogue among the main parties of the country was composed by Antônio de Oliveira Brito Minister of Education, Armando Monteiro Filho Minister of Agriculture and Ulysses Guimarães, Minister of Industry and Commerce from the PSD; Francisco Clementino de San Tiago Dantas Minister of External Relations and Estácio Souto Maior Minister of Health from the PTB; Virgílio Távora Minister of Transportation and Gabriel Passos Minister of Mines and Energy from the National Democratic Union; André Franco Montoro Minister of Labor and Social Security from the party Partido Democrata Cristão (PDC); Walter Moreira Sales Minister of Finance; General João de Segadas Viana, Minister of War, Ângelo Nolasco de Almeida, Minister of the Navy and Brigadier Clóvis Monteiro Travassos, Minister of Air force.

Neves temporarily occupied the seat of the Ministry of Justice from 8 September to 13 October while he waited for the Social Progressive Party (PSP) which had former Governor of São Paulo, Adhemar Pereira de Barros as President, to indicate a name that would solidify his support to the parliamentary cabinet and replace him. Ademar suggested Congressman from the state of Goiânia, Alfredo Nasser, who accepted and assumed post, replacing Neves.

The program presented by the Cabinet to the Chamber on 28 September which was approved on that same day, was relatively generic in the way its terms had been formulated. The presentation of such program had the goal of fulfilling a formality that was inseparable from the nature of the new regime, rather than to determine a government policy &quot;per se&quot;. It defended the practice of periodical salary adjustments that were compatible with the expanding inflation indexes. The program complimented Operation Pan-American and pastoral pontifical Mater et Magistra. It approved the agrarian reform &quot;as an essential first step towards the integration of countrymen into our economic life&quot;. And it proclaimed to be identified with an open-door policy towards foreign capital. The new government also defended the existence of a law that would control the transfer of profits abroad, as long as it did not discouraged foreign investors, considered vital to the defrayment of the national economic development.

The first parliamentary cabinet was formed during a serious politico-military crisis, but was able to decrease the rivalries between the main political chains in the country. However, the peoples&#x27; dissatisfaction continued to grow and their protests against high inflation and for larger salary adjustments, multiplied. The crisis that followed Jânio Quadros resignation had paralyzed the country for thirteen days, which only contributed to the increase of the economical crisis. The continuous dead-lock labor negotiations resulted in an explosion of successive strikes. Several of Petrobrás&#x27; units were ceased for forty days while Mining and Energy Minister, Gabriel Passos faced difficulties inside his own administration in trying to promote the replacement of Petrobras&#x27; president and director.

According to Neves, the parliamentary cabinet considered the agrarian reform &quot;an issue of absolute priority on the government&#x27;s agenda&quot; and it helped the Minister of Agriculture create the commission that was in charge of evaluating and apprizing the studies and proposals on the issue. In January 1962, the government received an agrarian reform project from the senator of Minas Gerais&#x27;, Senator Milton Campos, from the UDN. And a month later, the Department of Agriculture presented its own project. On 15 February the government created the National Council for Agrarian Reform, composed by Hélder Câmara (Auxiliary Bishop of Rio de Janeiro), Pombpeu Acióli Borges, Paulo Schilling, and Edgar Teixeira Leite who was responsible for defining the property areas to be reformed. Meanwhile, social tension was increasing in the interior, especially in the Northeast region. The assassination of the Farmers League President, João Pedro Teixeira (PB), started protest manifestations that were soon prohibited by Commander of the Army, General Artur da Costa e Silva. Neves attributed the turmoil generated by the countrymen to the existence of &quot;an archaic rural structure&quot; and took the initiative to propose political measures aimed at solving the problem, such as the Rural Union Plan, which was approved by the office council and largely expanded a contingent of sixteen million agricultural workers, including the illiterate.

During this period the escalation of the economic crisis was paired with the radicalization of the political struggles between currents that defended the so-called &quot;base reforms&quot; (constitutional, agrarian, urban, banking and tax reforms) and the conservative forces that opposed them, and accused the government of sponsoring social agitation. On 1 May 1962, Goulart gave a speech in Volta Redonda, in Rio de Janeiro, defending the urgency of reforms and the return of a presidencialist regime that would safeguard the actions of a strong and stable executive power. Therefore, the conservative sectors&#x27; mistrust in the government&#x27;s intentions grew. In this context, Neves&#x27;s cabinet – that was characterized by a policy that was committed to obtaining a large national consensus – started to lose the reason for its existence. On 6 June the cabinet, including the prime-minister, resigned in mass. Its members were then able to run for parliamentary elections in October of the same year, and Neves was elected congressman in Minas Gerais. When Neves reported to Congress, he highlighted that the estimated deficit was around 200 billion cruzeiros (former currency), but the forecast increase of the public service salaries would elevate the amount to 330 billion. During his term as congressman, Neves claimed to have had partial success in his goal of pacifying the national political mood.

Law 4.070 from 15 June 1962 that elevated Acre&#x27;s territory to the category of State and Law 4.024 from 20 December 1961 which presented the first Foundation and Guidelines of National Education can be highlighted in the period of his office as President of the Council of Ministers.

==Opposition to the Military Regime==
Back at the Chamber of Deputies, Tancredo maintained his support of João Goulart’s administration until he was deposed by the Military Coup in 1964. Tancredo was one of the few politicians who went to see João Goulart off at the Salgado Filho Airport, in Porto Alegre, when he left to Uruguay on exile. He was the only member of the Social Democratic Party who did not vote for General Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco during the presidential elections by the National Congress on 11 April 1964. 
With the end of the existing multiparty system, José de Magalhães Pinto was invited to join the National Renewal Alliance, also known as ARENA. He politely declined the invitation due to the presence of his adversaries from the UDN, especially José de Magalhães Pinto from the new situationist college.

Although Neves had been João Goulart&#x27;s prime minister and friend, he did not have his political rights annulled during the military coup thanks to his influence on the military.

Being a moderate objector of the military regime of 1964, Neves soon sought shelter in the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). He was re-elected congressman in 1966, 1970 and 1974. During his parliamentary performance, he tried hard to avoid conflicts with the military government, and was part of MDB&#x27;s moderate wing. He did not object to dialogue with the situacionist forces. That showed a posture that was contrary to the one the MDB&#x27;s &quot;authentic&quot; wing had. In 1978 he was elected senator in Minas Gerais.

Neves founded the Popular Party in 1980 and was elected as its president. He did that by gathering moderates from the MDB and the ARENA around him, including his old rival José de Magalhães Pinto, during President João Goulart&#x27;s administration which had recreated a multiparty system in 1979.

In 1980 Neves defended the incorporation of the Popular Party into the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) when faced with difficulties created by the electoral rules that would be applied in the 1982 elections. As a result, he was chosen as national vice-president of PMDB, and on that same year, was elected Governor of Minas Gerais after a tough dispute with Democratic Social Party candidate, Eliseu Resende. His running mate and Vice Governor, Hélio Garcia, gave him the support that was fundamental to his election. Garcia was very knowledgeable about the small counties in Minas Gerais, which Neves used to call &quot;grotões&quot;. His victory did not come easily due to electoral statutes of the time which forecast the &quot;attached vote&quot; obligating citizens to vote for mayor, city councilman and governor of the same party. That favored the PDS, since it was a strong party in the small counties of Minas Gerais. During his inauguration ceremony as governor, he pronounced a phrase that became famous: &quot;Mineiros, Minas Gerais&#x27;s first priority is its own freedom&quot;.

He resigned the post as senator just a few days before assuming the Palácio da Liberdade, and was substituted by Alfredo Campos. He then nominated Hélio Garcia for Mayor of Belo Horizonte. Neves maintained his conciliatory stance even when in executive office, which guaranteed a good standing with the Federal Government. He renounced his seat as state governor on 14 August 1984 in order to run for presidency, and turned the government of Minas Gerais over to Hélio Garcia.

==&quot;Diretas Já&quot; and the Electoral College==
On 15 March 1983, the elected governors took office, and debates around President João Figueiredo&#x27;s succession began. During his address at the end of 1982, the President abdicated from coordinating debates around his succession, and put the issue in the hands of his party, the PDS. The lack of a consensus by the PDS in appointing a name denoted cracks in the governmental college. The college later appointed Mário Andreazza as Minister of Internal Affairs, Marco Maciel as senator, and Paulo Maluf as congressman, whom all brought a significant part of the PDS with them. Vice-president Aureliano Chaves immediately started having conflicts with President Figueiredo, and that only complicated the process of succession.

Talks towards Neves&#x27;s candidacy as president began in 1983 when he received a visit led by José Fragelli who brought 15 senators from the PMDB with him. The group proposed his candidacy as president in the elections that were set by the Electoral College and scheduled for 15 January 1985.

In the beginning of that year, Fragelli organized a group of 14 senators, all of whom were willing to work for the presidential campaign, to visit Governor Neves. It was Senator Fragelli himself, who after this meeting told Senator Pedro Simon that if the PMDB decided to be part of the Electoral College, their candidate would then be Neves.

Other segments of the military regime opposition acted differently, and included the re-institution of direct presidential elections in their agenda. The opposition&#x27;s first action took place in the county of Pernambuco, led by Mozart de Abreu e Lima, on the same day that the Military Regime completed its 19th year, 31 March 1983. The manifestations that occurred in the Northeast of Brazil resulted from a manifesto by the ten opposition governors (nine from the PMDB and one from the PDT), which demanded the re-establishment of direct presidential elections.

The very next day, a commission supporting the was formed in the capital of São Paulo and gathered ten thousand people. They were frustrated with the rejection of the constitutional amendment from 25 April 1984, called Dantes de Oliveira. Many other commissions were formed between January and April 1984 and were given the name &quot;Direct Now Campaign&quot;.

In April 1984, Neves gathered with more than 1,500,000 people in the Vale do Anhangabaú in support of the movement. Neves was the first one to give a speech and received a massive applause when he said: &quot;The time has come for us to free our nation from this confusion that has overtaken the country in the past twenty years&quot;. He then continued to defend the approval of Congress’ amendment, stating that &quot;those members of the parliament who voted against the amendment would have to leave Congress since they no longer represented the people&#x27;s interests&quot;.

Senator José Sarney, President of the PDS, was very aware of the risks surrounding such a large fragmentation inside his party, so he proposed to his affiliates, the realization of a pre-election that would determine the candidate to the presidency. His proposal was quickly repelled by the &quot;malufistas&quot; who interpreted it as a way to derail the leader&#x27;s candidacy. This fact led Sarney to leave the PDS presidency and to abandon his party a few days afterwards. He was later followed by Jorge Bornhausen, who also left the party.

Governors from the PMDB and Leonel Brizola from the Democratic Labour Party (Brazil) PDT announced their support of Neves as a candidate from the opposition in the elections of the Electoral College (that was composed of the National Congress and representatives from the Legislative Assemblies). In contrast, Aureliano Chaves and Marco Maciel were removed from the dispute, which left Paulo Maluf and Mário Andreazza as candidates. However, Maluf&#x27;s victory led his opponents to support Neves.

After an agreement was made between the PMDB and a dissident movement from the PDS called Liberal Front, it was established that Neves would be the candidate for president, and that José Sarney (former ARENA member and who had left the PDS to join the PMDB) would be the candidate for vice-president. The Liberal Front emerged in 1984 from a divergence in the PMDB, party which later became the Liberal Front Party, today&#x27;s Democrats. This dissident movement was ignited in the PDS when Paulo Maluf, former governor of São Paulo, won the internal dispute inside the PDS against Minister of Home Affairs, Mário Andreazza. Maluf was then chosen by the PDS to be their candidate for President against Neves, in the Electoral college on 15 January 1985.

Neves secretly wanted businessman Antônio Ermírio de Moraes to be vice-president. Ermírio de Moraes, born in a traditional family from Pernambuco, was business leader in São Paulo. His father, José Ermírio de Moraes had been senator through the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB) in Pernambuco and was a friend of Getúlio Vargas. His secret was revealed and the possibility of Antônio becoming vice-president was discarded in São Paulo.

The PMDB had minority seats in the Electoral college, and for that reason, it needed to gain votes from the PDS to be able to elect a president.

At that time, the candidates for president and vice-president had to be from the same party, and party coalitions where not allowed. Sarney was able to affiliate himself to the PMDB because he had been senator through the National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA) in 1978, party which had been extinct since then. Therefore, his change in parties was not considered by the existing electoral rules, as an infidelity worthy of losing a mandate, since Sarney was not leaving a party by which he had been elected. This was not the case with Marco Maciel, who could not change parties since he had been elected senator in Pernambuco through the PDS in 1982. Aureliano Chaves could not be a candidate for president through the PMDB, even though he had been elected vice-president through the ARENA in 1978, since he had been the President as a substitute for João Figueiredo, becoming therefore, ineligible for president. Aureliano was also ineligible for vice-president because at the time, re-election was not allowed.

Neves was cast as candidate for having approval by the military and for being considered a moderate. In the military arena, the support that former President Ernesto Geisel offered was very decisive. But Neves&#x27;s moderation was a target of criticism by the Workers&#x27; Party (PT), which did not accept the electoral college.

Neves also gained influence inside the Democratic Social Party PDS when meeting with governors of the Northeast (all nine of them were elected by the PDS and were, in majority, politicians from a new generation that admired Neves) during the meetings with the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast. Minas Gerais belonged to the SUDENE because its North region was part of the drought area known as &quot;Drought Polygon&quot;. Many of these governors moved to the Liberal Front that later became the Liberal Front Party (PFL). Among Neves&#x27;s admirers, was former Governor of Bahia, Antônio Carlos Magalhães.

Antônio Carlos reacted to the statements made by Air force Minister, Délio Jardim de Matos, who said that whoever abandoned the PDS candidate was a traitor. In response, Antônio Carlos accused Délio Jardim of being such traitor. This was the first time that a minister form the military had been challenged during the Military Regime. From then on, the adherence to Neves only grew. The Baiano leader, Antônio Carlos, then added: &quot;To betray the Revolution of 1964 is to support Maluf for president&quot;.

In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Pequim&quot; in 1984, Neves described Maluf as &quot;symboliz[ing] all of the negative things the Revolution did in the last twenty years.&quot;

Even though they were indirect elections, Neves still did many rallies in public places. And, in a speech made during his campaign in the city of Vitória in November 1984, he said: &quot;To restore democracy is to restore the republic, it is to build a new republic, mission which I have received from the people and which will become reality by the power of not only a politician, but by of all the Brazilian citizens&quot;.

The Military Regime ended in 1985 after João Figueiredo&#x27;s administration was over. The expression &quot;New Republic&quot; became the way in which the period after 1985 became known in Brazilian politics.

The Neves-Sarney alliance was then made official and members of the opposition went on the road to defend their proposals in rallies that were as popular as the ones during the campaign.

Neves, who was hailed as a conciliation candidate, was elected president by the Electoral College in 1985. He received 480 votes while Maluf received 180 votes and there were 26 abstentions. The majority of these abstentions came from parliamentarians from the Workers&#x27; Party. They disobeyed the guidance given by their party and were then removed from it for having voted in Neves. As a result, Congressmen Aírton Soares, José Eudes and Bete Mendes were expelled from the PT.

When the results from the elections were announced on 15 January 1985, Neves said on a speech: &quot;Let us not be dispersed. Let us remain united as we were on public squares, with the same emotion, the same dignity and the same decision. As Tiradentes, that hero crazed by hope, used to say almost 200 years ago, we can make this country a great nation. Let&#x27;s do that!&quot; His victory was received enthusiastically by the population, and is still considered today as one of the most complex and successful works of &quot;political ingenuity&quot; in the history of Brazilian politics.

Soon after, the Workers&#x27; Party and the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) started making opposition to Neves. On the 11 February 1985 edition of the newspaper &quot;Jornal da Tarde&quot; there was a headline that read: &quot;The CUT and the PT declared war against Tancredo&quot;.

At the end of 1984 the polls showed that Neves had won the majority of the Electoral College. Fearing a maneuver from João Figueiredo that would extend his mandate two more years, and would establish direct elections for his successor, Neves went live on TV and declared that Maluf would waive his candidacy. Maluf reacted by guaranteeing that he would not. And so, with Maluf firmly planted in the dispute, João Figueiredo and the PDS were unable to change the rules of the successor&#x27;s game.

As soon as Neves was elected, he made an international excursion where he met with several heads of state in the attempt of gaining support for his office, which was being considered uncertain. He only agreed to have surgical operation after several Heads of state had arrived in Brasília for his inauguration. The meetings with heads of state were a strategic move by Neves to make the process of re-democratization irreversible. Neves&#x27;s maneuvers were so successful that they made even Ulysses Guimarães (referred to as &quot;Mr. Diretas&quot;) abdicate his dispute in order to support him. Their political agreement had included Neves&#x27;s future support of Guimarães in the next elections that would replace him and would be direct elections. This way, Guimarães gave up his candidacy to Neves.

==Illness and death==
Neves had undertaken a very strenuous campaign agenda. He gathered the support of Congress and state governors, and travelled abroad as the elected president. He had been suffering strong abdominal pain during the days preceding his inauguration. Advised by his doctors to seek treatment, he said: &quot;You can do whatever you want with me... &quot;after&quot; I take office.&quot; Neves feared that military hardliners would refuse to give power to the Vice President. He decided to only announce his illness on the day of his inauguration, 15 March 1985 after the heads of state who were supposed to be present had arrived in Brasília. That would have made it harder for a political rupture to occur. His concern with the assurance of the inauguration was echoed by the phrase he had heard from Getúlio Vargas regarding the subject: &quot;It is not enough to win elections in Brazil, it is necessary to take office!&quot;

In Brasília, during the religious ceremony at the Dom Bosco Sanctuary, he developed strong continuous abdominal pain. In the hospital, he told his cousin Francisco Dornelleswho had been appointed as Finance Ministerthat he would refuse surgery if he didn&#x27;t have the guarantee that outgoing President João Figueiredo would induct José Sarney. Dornelles promised his cousin that Sarney would be inducted. According to information compiled by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, the maneuvers to bring Sarney to office were already under Ulysses Guimarães (President of the Chamber, PMDB-SP), and Leitão de Abreu&#x27;s Chief of Staff of Brazil lead.

The official version said that Neves had diverticulitis. But, later reports indicated that he had a benign but infected leiomyoma. The existence of a tumor was hidden by the doctors until the last minute, due to the possible impact that the word cancer would have during that age.

On 15 March, newly sworn in Vice President José Sarney assumed presidential powers and duties as acting president before the National Congress while Neves recovered. He read the statement that Neves had written for his inauguration, preaching national conciliation and the installation of a constituent national assembly. It read: The ceremony to transfer power took place at the Palácio do Planalto. President Figueiredo did not appear, refusing to give the presidential sash on to José Sarney since he was a substitute and not his elected successor. It was the official photographer of the palace, Gervézio Batista, who put the sash around Sarney.

On 28 June 1985 Sarney fulfilled the promise Neves had made during his campaign, to bring Message 330, which called for the convening of a new Constituent Assembly, to National Congress. This resulted in passage of Constitutional Amendment 26 on 27 November 1985. New constituents were chosen on 15 November 1986 and later took office on 1 February 1987, readily initiating the elaboration of the new Constitution of Brazil in 1988.

There was great tension at the time due to the possibility of the growing democratic opening being interrupted. In the event of Sarney not taking office, President of Chamber of Deputies, Ulysses Guimarães, would. Guimarães belonged to the PMDB and was not well accepted by the members of the military. The biggest risk was that the more conservative sectors of the military, the so-called &quot;hardliners&quot;, were trying to destabilize the re-democratization process to maintain the Brazilian military government in power.

On the eve of 15 March, Guimarães, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Sarney and the Minister of the Army Leônidas Pires Gonçalves had a meeting. During the meeting, Gonçalves&#x27;s interpretation of the 1967 Constitution prevailed, and so, the National Congress decided on Sarney.

The Hospital da Base in Brasília was undergoing restoration when Neves was admitted, and had no ICU; this contributed to complications after Neves&#x27;s surgery, and his health declined. He was transferred to the Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo in São Paulo. Neves had seven surgeries, and died of a generalized infection at 22:23 BRT on 21 April (same date as Tiradentes&#x27;s death), at the age of 75. Rumors at the time said that Neves had been dead for days, and that his death had been concealed while a new government presided by Sarney could be formed and so the date of his death would coincide with Tiradentes&#x27; death.

There was great commotion in the nation, especially because Neves was the first civilian elected president since 1960, when Jânio Quadros was elected. He was also the first politician from the military opposition to be elected president since the military coup of 1964.

Neves&#x27;s funeral was one of the largest funerals in Brazil&#x27;s history. It was estimated that between São Paulo, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and São João del Rei, more than two million people saw the coffin in procession. Mineiro singer Milton Nascimento sang &quot;Coração de Estudante&quot; to mark the occasion. The elected president foresaw an epitaph during a conversation with a group of friends in the Senate: &quot;Here lies Tancredo Neves unwillingly&quot;. It was never engraved on the tombstone that was placed beside the St. Francis of Assisi Church at the cemetery in São Paulo. His burial in São João del Rei was broadcast on national TV. Guimarães gave a speech before his grave, which was grave number 85 (in remembrance of the year of his election and death). There is a commemorative plaque at the cemetery from the President of France, François Mitterrand, who had met Neves during his visit to Europe.

In March 2008, Neves&#x27;s grave was vandalized and the marble piece from the upper part of the tomb was broken. He was honored in São João del Rei with the installation of his statue placed next to the statue of Tiradentes
In 2012, Neves&#x27;s children requested a Habeas Data from the Federal Justice in Brasília. The Federal Medicine Council and the Regional Council of the State of Distrito Federal would have to render them all of the investigations, ethical-disciplinary inquiries, documents, and doctor&#x27;s testimonials relative to the care delivered to the president.

The Neves family is represented by Historian and Researcher, Luís Mir, author of the book &quot;The Patient, The Tancredo Neves Case&quot;, and by attorneys Juliana Porcaro Bisol, Bruno Prenholato and Cláudia Duarte. According to them, the requested documentation will allow for a historical investigation of what really happened, especially because it would contain the identification of the doctors responsible for the President&#x27;s treatment.

==Legacy and tributes==
Twenty years after his death, the medical body of the Hospital da Base in Brasília revealed that they had not announced the correct report at that time, and that Neves&#x27;s medical condition had not been diverticulitis, but a tumor. Although it was benign, the discovery of a tumor could have been interpreted as cancer back then. That would have caused unpredictable effects on the political development of that time.

The Vice President of the time, José Sarney, took office as President, bringing an end to the period of five governments that had been conducted by members of the Military.

Even without taking office, Neves is, by law, counted amongst the former Presidents of Brazil, by law 7.465, of 21 April 1986: &quot;Citizen Tancredo de Almeida Neves, elected and not vested due to his death, will be figured in the gallery of those who have been anointed by the Brazilian nation, to the Supreme Justice, under all legal matters&quot;.

In 1990, the Tancredo Neves Memorial was opened in his hometown São João del Rei, where a narration of his personal and political journey can be found.

On 1 March 2010, a special stamp was created to celebrate Neves&#x27;s 100th birthday. This event was part of a series of tributes that took place until his birth date, 4 March. During a tribute to the former President&#x27;s 100 birthday in Brasília, his bust was inaugurated in the Senate Noble Hall. He is remembered as &quot;a conciliating and an able political articulator&quot;.

A city in Bahia was named Presidente Tancredo Neves in his honor. And, the capital of Bahia, Salvador, has its business and finance centers on Avenida Tancredo Neves. Tancredo Neves International Airport in Belo Horizonte is named for him. The Tancredo Neves Bridge connects the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu with the Argentine Puerto Iguazú, crossing over the Iguassu River.

Neves wrote not only articles for newspapers such as &quot;Estado de Minas&quot;, &quot;O Correio&quot; and &quot;Diário de São João del Rei&quot;, but he was also author of &quot;The Parliamentary Regime and Brazil&#x27;s Reality&quot; and &quot;The World Scene and National Security&quot;, published in the magazine &quot;Revista Brasileira de Estudos Políticos&quot;. He also wrote numerous speeches and opinions that were published in newspapers, magazines and parliamentary annuals.

On 24 February 1983 he took seat 12 in the Minas Gerais Academy of Arts having been sponsored by Alvarenga Peixoto to replace Alberto Donato.

He left two testimonials that were featured on books. The first book was written based on an interview he had given his niece, Lucília de Almeida Neves. It was titled &quot;Tancredo Neves, the Trajectory of a Liberal&quot;, and narrated his political trajectory until 1954 only, because he stopped the interview there in order to focus completely on the elections in the Electoral College that was taking place in 1985. The second interview-turned-book was titled &quot;Tancredo talks about Getúlio&quot;, where he gave testimonials about the late president, and his own political actions beside him.

A feature film and a biography were made about Neves&#x27;s life. The film by João Batista de Andrade was titled &quot;A Céu Aberto&quot;, and the biography &quot;Tancredo Neves, the Trajectory of a Liberal&quot; was written by his niece Lucília de Almeida Neves Delgado and Vera Alice Cardoso. In 2011, the documentary titled &quot;Tancredo – The Crossing&quot; by Silvio Tendler was released.

In 2010, the book titled &quot;The Patient - the Tancredo Neves Case&quot; by Luís Mir was released. The book gathers documents obtained at Hospital da Base in Brasília and from the Heart Institute of Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo in São Paulo, where Neves died. The book shows a surgical guide that better explains his surgeries, and has testimonials from the specialists involved. It reveals what happened behind the scenes of the clinical case that altered the path of Brazilian democracy and shook the reputation of doctors in the country.

At the end of 2010, Minas Gerais Governor Aécio Neves, inaugurated the new branch of the State Government, denominated Administrative City Tancredo Neves.

In 2013, the Tancredo Neves Memorial was inaugurated in Brasília. It is located on the Panteão da Pátria in the Praça dos Três Poderes. The space features videos, digital media and original documents portraying steps of the period of the re-democratization of Brazil. It also showcases some of Neves&#x27;s speech manuscripts, letters written by him and to him by personalities such as Juscelino Kubistchek and João Goulart, as well as material from the campaign, and his certificate as President.

==Family==
On 25 May 1938, Neves married Risoleta Guimarães Tolentino (20 July 1917 – 21 September 2003) with whom he had three children; one of them, Inês, married politician Aécio Ferreira da Cunha. Their son is the politician Aécio Neves.

<text>Wendell Cushing Neville (May 12, 1870 – July 8, 1930) was a major general of the Marine Corps as well as a Medal of Honor recipient and the 14th Commandant of the Marine Corps between 1929 and 1930.

==Military career==
Neville was born in Portsmouth, Virginia and later entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1886 chiefly because no one else in his district desired an appointment to Annapolis that year. After graduating in 1890 and following a two-year cruise aboard a warship, which was the practice of the era, was commissioned a Marine Corps second lieutenant.

At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, 2nd Lt. Neville was assigned to the 1st Battalion, hurriedly organized under Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Huntington for service in Cuba. The battalion staged a daring attack under heavy gunfire at Guantanamo Bay, established a beachhead and routed enemy forces in that area. For outstanding valor and leadership in that action, Lt. Neville was brevetted a captain in the Marine Corps on June 13, 1898. He was later awarded the Brevet Medal, following its creation in 1921.

Promoted to the permanent rank of captain a few months after the war, Neville was assigned to a battalion of Marines ordered to China to relieve the hard-pressed garrison at Peking during the Boxer Rebellion. He took part in four battles in that area and was again commended for his gallantry.
In the Philippine Islands not long afterwards, he was appointed military governor of Basilan Province. Following that assignment he served in Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama and Hawaii.

During the United States occupation of Veracruz, he was in command of the 2nd Advance Base Regiment. While in command of Marines landing at Veracruz, Mexico, on April 21, 1914, he displayed conspicuous gallantry. Lieutenant Colonel Neville was awarded the Medal of Honor for his distinguished conduct during the Vera Cruz intervention. He, Major General Smedley D. Butler and Major General David Dixon Porter were the only individuals to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and the Brevet Medal.

In 1915, Neville returned to China where he was chosen to command the combined Allied guard at Peking, serving in that position until 1917. He was promoted to colonel in August 1916.

On January 1, 1918, almost nine months after the American entry into World War I, he was placed in command of the 5th Marine Regiment in France, succeeding Hiram I. Bearss. The 5th Marines, together with the 6th Marine Regiment, formed part of the 4th Marine Brigade. In May he moved his regiment into action at Belleau Wood where Germany&#x27;s big drive was decisively halted. In July, after handing over the 5th Marines to Logan Feland, Neville&#x27;s command was enlarged to include the 4th Marine Brigade, taking over from James Harbord, which he directed during the remaining days of the war and during its occupation service in Germany. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1919.

After service with the Army of Occupation in Germany, Brig. Gen. Neville and his brigade returned to the United States in July 1919. Promoted to major general in August 1920, he served as assistant to the commandant of the Marine Corps and later became commanding general, Fleet Marine Force with headquarters in San Francisco. He also commanded the Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia.

Maj. Gen. Neville succeeded Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune as Commandant of the Marine Corps on March 5, 1929. Maj. Gen. Neville&#x27;s sudden death on July 8, 1930, at Edgewater Beach, Maryland, while in office as commandant, closed one of the most brilliant military careers of his day. General Butler lamented the death of &quot;my dear old friend,&quot; labeling Lejeune, Neville, and himself &quot;the three musketeers of the Marines.&quot;

He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Awards and honors==
During the 38 years he spent as a U.S. Marine, Major General Neville received five citations, as well as: 


, a United States Navy transport, was named in honor of Major General Neville.

===Medal of Honor citation===

NEVILLE, Wendell Cushing
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Marine Corps
G.O. Navy Department, No. 177
December 4, 1915

Citation:

For distinguished conduct in battle engagements of Vera Cruz 21 and April 22, 1914. In command of the Second Regiment Marines, Lieutenant Colonel Neville was in both days&#x27; fighting and almost continually under fire from soon after landing, about noon on the 21st, until we were in possession of the city, about noon of the 22d. His duties required him to be at points of great danger in directing his officers and men, and he exhibited conspicuous courage, coolness and skill in his conduct of the fighting. Upon his courage and skill depended, in great measure, success or failure. His responsibilities were great and he met them in a manner worthy of commendation.

<doc id="764052" wikidata="Q567497" url="?curid=764052" title="France–Germany relations">
<text>France–Germany relations or the Franco-German relations form a part of the wider politics of the European Union. The two countries have a long – and often contentious – relationship stretching back to the Middle Ages. After World War II, the two nations have largely reconciled. Since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1958, they have been among the founders and leading members of the European Communities and later the European Union along with Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium.

General relations between the two countries since 1871, according to Ulrich Krotz, have had three grand periods: &quot;hereditary enmity&quot; (down to 1945), &quot;reconciliation&quot; (1945–1963) and since 1963 the &#x27;&quot;special relationship&quot; embodied in a cooperation called &quot;Franco-German Friendship&quot;. In the context of the European Union, the cooperation between the two countries is immense and intimate. Even though France has, at times, been eurosceptical in outlook, especially under President Charles de Gaulle, Franco-German agreements and cooperations have always been key to furthering the ideals of European integration.

In recent times, France and Germany are among the most enthusiastic proponents of the further integration of the EU. They are sometimes described as the &quot;twin engine&quot; or &quot;core countries&quot; pushing for moves. A tram straddling the Franco-German border, across the river Rhine from Strasbourg to Kehl, was inaugurated on 28 April 2017 symbolizing the strength of relations between the two countries.

==History==
===Early interactions===

Both France and Germany track their early history from the territories of Gaul and Germania, and to the time of Frankish Empire under Charlemagne, which included most of the area of both modern-day France and Germany, as well as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and northern Italy.

Predecessors, which lived on the territory of modern France and Germany fought together in the Gallic War against Julius Caesar and the Roman Republic between 58 and 50 BC. According to Caesar, the Gallic Volcae Tectosages had once crossed the Rhine and colonized parts of Germania, but had since become militarily inferior to the Germani (Germanic people). He also writes that Germani had once crossed the Rhine into northeast Gaul and driven away its Gallic inhabitants, and that the Belgae claimed to be largely descended from these Germanic invaders. Years later, Both Gaul and Germania were both invaded by the Roman Empire.

Years after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, The death of Charlemagne&#x27;s son Louis the Pious and the following partition of the Frankish Empire in the 843 Treaty of Verdun marked the end of a single state. While the population in both the Western and Eastern kingdoms had relative homogeneous language groups (Gallo-Romanic in West Francia, and Low German and High German in East Francia), Middle Francia was a mere strip of a mostly blurring, yet culturally rich language-border-area, roughly between the rivers Meuse and Rhine – and soon partitioned again. After the 880 Treaty of Ribemont, the border between the western and eastern kingdoms remained almost unchanged for some 600 years. Germany went on with a centuries-long attachment with Italy, while France grew into deeper relations with England.

Despite a gradual cultural alienation during the High and Late Middle Ages, social and cultural interrelations remained present through the preeminence of Latin language and Frankish clergy and nobility.

===France and the Holy Roman Empire===
The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, a member of the Austrian House of Habsburg, inherited the Low Countries and the Franche-Comté in 1506. When he also inherited Spain in 1516, France was surrounded by Habsburg territories and felt under pressure. The resulting tension between the two powers caused a number of conflicts such as the War of the Spanish Succession, until the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 made them allies against Prussia.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), devastating large parts of the Holy Roman Empire, fell into this period. Although the war was mostly a conflict between Protestants and Catholics, Catholic France sided with the Protestants against the Austrian-led Catholic Imperial forces. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 gave France part of Alsace. The 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen consolidated this result by bringing several towns under French control. In 1681, Louis XIV marched into the city of Strasbourg on 30 September, and proclaimed its annexation.

Meanwhile, the expanding Muslim Ottoman Empire became a serious threat to Austria. The Papal States initiated a so-called Holy League against the &quot;hereditary enemy&quot; of Christian Europe (&quot;Erbfeind christlichen Namens&quot;). Far from joining or supporting the common effort of the Holy Roman Empire and Poland-Lithuania, France, under Louis XIV, invaded the Spanish Netherlands in September 1683, a few days before the Battle of Vienna. While Austria was occupied with the Great Turkish War (1683–1699), France initiated the War of the Grand Alliance (1688–1697). The attempt to conquer large parts of southern Germany ultimately failed when Imperial and Imperial circle troops were withdrawn from the Ottoman border and moved to the region. However, following a scorched earth policy that caused a large public outcry at the time, French troops devastated large parts of the Palatinate, burning down and levelling numerous cities and towns in southern Germany.

===France and Prussia===


In the 18th century, the rise of Prussia as a new German power caused the Diplomatic Revolution and an alliance between France, the Habsburgs and Russia, manifested in 1756 in the Treaty of Versailles and the Seven Years&#x27; War against Prussia and Great Britain. Although a German national state was on the horizon, the loyalties of the German population were primarily with smaller states. The French war against Prussia was justified through its role as guarantor of the Peace of Westphalia, and it was in fact fighting on the side of the majority of German states.

Frederick the Great led the defense of Prussia for 7 years, and though heavily outnumbered, defeated his French and Austrian invaders. Prussia and France clashed multiple times, and many more times than the other countries. This started years of hatred between the two countries. Frederick the Great was soon respected by all of his enemies, and Napoleon himself used him as a model for battle.

The civil population still regarded war as a conflict between their authorities, and did not so much distinguish between troops according to the side on which they fought but rather according to how they treated the local population. The personal contacts and mutual respect between French and Prussian officers did not stop entirely while they were fighting each other, and the war resulted in a great deal of cultural exchange between the French occupiers and German population.

===Impact of French Revolution and Napoleon===

German nationalism emerged as a strong force after 1807, as Napoleon conquered much of Germany and brought in the new ideals of the French Revolution. The French mass conscription for the Revolutionary Wars and the beginning formation of nation states in Europe made war increasingly a conflict between peoples rather than a conflict between authorities carried out on the backs of their subjects.

Napoleon put an end to the millennium-old Holy Roman Empire in 1806, forming his own Confederation of the Rhine, and reshaped the political map of the German states, which were still divided. The wars, often fought in Germany and with Germans on both sides, as in the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig, also marked the beginning of what was explicitly called &quot;French–German hereditary enmity&quot;. Napoleon directly incorporated German-speaking areas such as the Rhineland and Hamburg into his First French Empire and treated the monarchs of the remaining German states as vassals. Modern German nationalism was born in opposition to French domination, under Napoleon. In the recasting of the map of Europe after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the German-speaking territories in the Rhineland adjoining France were put under the rule of Prussia.

===France and Bavaria===
Bavaria as the third-largest state in Germany after 1815 enjoyed much warmer relations with France than the larger Prussia or Austria. From 1670 onwards, the two countries were allies for almost a century, primarily to counter Habsburg ambitions to incorporate Bavaria into Austria. This alliance was renewed after the rise of Napoleon to power with a friendship treaty in 1801 and a formal alliance in August 1805, pushed for by the Bavarian Minister Maximilian von Montgelas. With French support, Bavaria was elevated to the status of a Kingdom in 1806. Bavaria supplied 30,000 troops for the invasion of Russia in 1812, of which very few returned. With the decline of the First French Empire, Bavaria opted to switch sides on 8 October 1813 and left the French alliance in favour of an Austrian one through the Treaty of Ried.

===Nineteenth century===

==== German states defeat France, 1870-1871====
During the first half of the 19th century, many Germans looked forward to a unification of the German states; one issue was whether Catholic Austria would be a part. German nationalists believed that a united Germany would replace France as the world&#x27;s dominant land power. This argument was aided by demographic changes: since the Middle Ages, France had the largest population in Western Europe, but in the 19th century its population stagnated (a trend which continued until the second half of the 20th century), and the population of the German states overtook it and continued to rapidly increase.

The eventual unification of Germany was triggered by the Franco-German War in 1870 and subsequent French defeat. German forces defeated the French armies at the Battle of Sedan. Finally, in the Treaty of Frankfurt, reached after a lengthy siege of Paris, France was forced to cede the mostly Germanic-speaking Alsace-Lorraine territory (consisting of most of Alsace and a quarter of Lorraine), and pay an indemnity of five billion francs. Thereafter, Germany was the leading land power.
Although initially against it, Bismarck eventually gave into the Army and to intense public demand in Germany for acquisition of the border provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, thereby turning France into a permanent, deeply committed enemy. Theodore Zeldin says: &quot;Revenge and the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine became a principal object of French policy for the next forty years. That Germany was France&#x27;s enemy became the basic fact of international relations.&quot; Bismarck&#x27;s solution was to make France a pariah nation, encouraging royalty to ridicule its new republican status, and building complex alliances with the other major powers – Austria, Russia and Great Britain – to keep France isolated, diplomatically.

====Late 19th century====
The short-term French reaction to defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 was Revanchism: a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat came in high demand, such as those by Alphonse de Neuville.

The Alsace-Lorraine issue remained a minor theme after 1880, and Republicans and Socialists systematically downplayed the issue and the monarchists (who emphasized the issue) faded away. Revanchism was not a major cause of war in 1914 because it faded after 1880. J.F.V. Keiger says: &quot;By the 1880s, Franco-German relations were relatively good.&quot;

After 1880, the rapid growth in the population and economy of Germany left France increasingly far behind. In the 1890s, relationships remained good, as Germany supported France during its difficulties with Great Britain over African colonies. Any lingering harmony collapsed in 1905, when Germany took an aggressively hostile position to French claims to Morocco. There was talk of war and France strengthened its ties with Great Britain and Russia.

===First World War===

The French public had very little interest in foreign affairs and elite French opinion was strongly opposed to war with its more powerful neighbor. French foreign policy was based on a fear that Germany was larger and steadily growing more powerful. In 1914 the chief pressure group was the &quot;Parti colonial&quot;, a coalition of 50 organizations with a combined total of only 5,000 members. When war broke out in 1914, recovery of the two lost provinces became France&#x27;s primary war aim.

After Bismarck&#x27;s removal in 1890, French efforts to isolate Germany became successful; with the formation of the Triple Entente, Germany began to feel encircled. Foreign minister Delcassé, especially, went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Great Britain, and finally the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente. This formal alliance with Russia, and informal alignment with Britain, against Germany and Austria-Hungary eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France&#x27;s Allies.

===1920s===
The Allied victory saw France regain Alsace-Lorraine and briefly resume its old position as the leading land power on the European continent. France was the leading proponent of harsh peace terms against Germany at the Paris Peace Conference. Since the war had been fought on French soil, it had destroyed much of French infrastructure and industry, and France had suffered the highest number of casualties proportionate to population. Much French opinion wanted the Rhineland, the section of Germany west of the Rhine river and the old focus of French ambition, to be detached from Germany as an independent country. In the end they settled for heavy German reparation payments, the military occupation of the Rhineland (1918–1930) and the demilitarization of it and an area stretching 50 kilometers east of the Rhine. On the remote Eastern end of the German Empire, the Memel territory was separated from the rest of East Prussia and occupied by France, before being annexed by Lithuania. In response to German failure in 1923 to pay reparations as required under the Treaty of Versailles, France occupied the industrial Ruhr area of Germany, the center of German coal and steel production, until 1925. Also, the French-dominated International Olympic Committee banned Germany from the Olympic Games of 1920 and 1924, illustrating French desire to isolate Germany.

====Locarno treaties of 1925====

In late 1924 German foreign minister Gustav Stresemann made his highest priority the restoration of German prestige and privileges as a leading European nation. French withdrawal from the occupied Ruhr was scheduled for January 1925, but Stresemann sensed that France was very nervous about its security and might cancel the withdrawal. He realized that France deeply desired a British guarantee of its postwar borders, but that London was reluctant. Stresemann came up with a plan whereby all sides would get what they wanted through guarantees set out in a series of treaties. British Foreign Minister Austen Chamberlain enthusiastically agreed. France realized that its occupation of the Ruhr had caused more financial and diplomatic damage than it was worth and went along with the plan. They convened a conference of foreign ministers in the Swiss resort of Locarno and worked out the treaties. The first was the most critical: a mutual guarantee of the frontiers of Belgium, France, and Germany, which was guaranteed by Britain and Italy. The second and third treaties called for arbitration between Germany and Belgium, and Germany and France regarding future disputes. The fourth and fifth were similar arbitration treaties between Germany and Poland, and Germany and Czechoslovakia. Poland especially, and Czechoslovakia as well, felt threatened by the main Locarno agreement, and the treaties were attempts to reassure them. The success of the Locarno agreements led to the admission of Germany to the League of Nations in September 1926, with a seat on its council as a permanent member. The result was the euphoric &quot;Spirit of Locarno&quot; across Europe—a sense that it was possible to achieve peace and a permanent system guaranteeing that peace.

===1930s===
The Great Depression on 1929-33 soured the mood in France, and plunged Germany into economic hardship and violent internal unrest. From 1933 under Adolf Hitler, Germany began to pursue an aggressive policy in Europe. Meanwhile, France in the 1930s was politically divided, and above all dreaded another war, which the French feared would again be fought on their soil for the third time, and again destroy a large percentage of their young men. France&#x27;s stagnant population meant that it would find it difficult to withhold the sheer force of numbers of a German invasion; it was estimated Germany could put two men of fighting age in the field for every French soldier. Thus in the 1930s the French, with their British allies, pursued a policy of appeasement of Germany, failing to respond to the remilitarization of the Rhineland, although this put the German army on a larger stretch of the French border.

===Second World War===

Finally, however, Hitler pushed France and Great Britain too far, and they jointly declared war when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. But, France remained exhausted and in no mood for a rerun of 1914–18. There was little enthusiasm and much dread in France at the prospect of actual warfare after the Phoney War. When the Germans launched their blitzkrieg invasion of France in 1940, the French Army crumbled within weeks, and with Britain retreating, an atmosphere of humiliation and defeat swept France.

A new government under Marshal Philippe Pétain surrendered, and German forces occupied most of the country. A minority of the French forces escaped abroad and continued the fight under General Charles de Gaulle and Free France. On the other hand, the French Resistance conducted sabotage operations inside German-occupied France. To support the invasion of Normandy of 1944, various groups increased their sabotage and guerrilla attacks; organizations such as the Maquis derailed trains, blew up ammunition depots, and ambushed Germans, for instance at Tulle. The 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, which came under constant attack and sabotage on their way across the country to Normandy, suspected the village of Oradour-sur-Glane of harboring resistance members, arms and explosives. In retaliation, they destroyed the town in the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre, killing 642 of its inhabitants.

There was also a free French army fighting with the Allies, numbering almost five hundred thousand men by June 1944, one million by December and 1.3 million by the end of the war. By the war&#x27;s end, the French army occupied south-west Germany and a part of Austria.

===France, Germany and United Europe===
====Pre-1944 ideas of France-German cooperation====
Marshal Petain, who ruled France under German supervision, 1940–44, adopted the ideology of National Revolution which was originally based on ideas which had been discussed for years. When the Franco-German reconciliation committee &quot;Comité France-Allemagne&quot; (&quot;French-German Friendship Committee&quot;) founded in 1935 in Paris it was an important element for Germany to get closer to France. It adopted Pro-European, Pro-German, anti British, anti liberal political and economic views. Key members of the Committee became the key leaders of the French collaborators with Nazis after 1940.

When Marshal Petain officially proclaimed the collaboration policy with Nazi Germany in June 1941, he justified it to the French people as an essential need for the New European Order and to keep the unity of France. Therefore, much of WW2 French propaganda was pro-European, exactly as German propaganda was. Therefore, a group called &quot;Group Collaboration&quot; had been established during the war in France, and led a myriad of conferences promoting Pro-Europeanism. The very first time the expression &quot;European Community&quot; was used was at its first sessions, as well as many conferences and guests lectures sponsored by the German government, propagating French-German reconciliation, French renewal and European solidarity.

====Post-war Europe====
The war left Europe in a weak position and divided between capitalism in the West, and communism in the East. For the first time in the history of Europe, both Americans and Soviets had a strategic foothold on the continent. Defeated Germany was under the control of the U.S., USSR, United Kingdom and France, until 1949. Soviet troops remained in those countries in Eastern Europe that had been liberated by the Red Army from the Nazis and ensured the political success of Communist parties controlled by the Kremlin.
The French, under De Gaulle, hoped to be a balancing act in 1945–46. French fears of a resurgent Germany made it reluctant to support the plan to merge the British and American zones of occupation. However, growing anger at the Soviets behaviour in Poland, and the need for American economic assistance, led the French to merge their zone into what became West Germany.

In 1947, the American Secretary of State, George Marshall, announced the Marshall Plan to help economic recovery, economic integration, and business-oriented modernization in Europe. Large sums went to France and Germany, which helped restore trade and financial relations. The Marshall Plan recipients set up the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) in 1948.

The idea of a Franco-German federation was a proposed merger between France and Germany after the end of World War II. The idea was promoted by French politician Robert Schuman in his declaration on May 9, 1950, which is now celebrated as Europe Day. The aim of the proposal was to create a lasting peace between the two countries and to promote economic cooperation.

The Franco-German federation proposal envisioned a common government, currency, and military. It also sought to establish a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which would integrate the coal and steel industries of France and Germany. The ECSC was created in 1952 and was the first step toward the creation of the European Union.

While the idea of a Franco-German federation never fully materialized, the proposal laid the foundation for the European Union and the close cooperation between France and Germany that has been a driving force behind European integration. Today, France and Germany are considered to be the engine of European integration and have played a key role in the creation of the European Monetary Union, the Schengen Agreement, and the European Stability Mechanism.

====Franco-German cooperation in the European Union====
Earlier in 1948, there were significant key leaders in the French civil service who favoured an agreement with the Germans as well as an integrated Europe that would include Germany. The French European Department was working on a coal and steel agreement for the Ruhr-Lorraine-Luxembourg area, with equal rights for all. One French civil servant recommended &#x27;laying down the bases of a Franco-German economic and political association that would slowly become integrated into the framework of the evolving Western organization&#x27;. Deighton strongly illustrated that the French leaders sought the cooperation with the Germans as key factor on the path of integrated Europe.

On a more practical level the increased level of cooperation between West Germany and France were driven by de Gaulle’s desire to build a power-bloc independently of the US, while Adenauer sought a fast integration into the western structures to receive full rights for the still occupied West German state as well as protection against the Soviet threat. The issue of dependency on the USA remained a sore spot at least for as long as DeGaulle remained in office (e.g. the West German parliament included a pro-NATO preamble into the Élysée Treaty, which caused considerable consternation with the French government). However, their shared interest in increased cooperation still existed and was also driven by strong support in the respective civil society, as it was seen as the best solution to prevent further bloodshed between the two nations.
In like manner, the German minister of economics Ludwig Erhard created a significant evolution in the German economy and a durable, well established trading relationship between the Federal Republic and its European neighbours as well. Later on when the Treaty of Rome came into action in 1958, it took the responsibility to strengthen and sustain the new political and economic relationships that had developed between the German nation and its former victims in Western Europe. The treaty beside it included side deals; it created a customs union and established the rules needed to make the competition mechanism work properly.

As a sequence of this, booming European economies, fired by West Germany, led to the formation of the new customs union known as the European Economic Community (EEC). But it did not go well as the organization of Europe, because only the members of the coal and steel community &#x27;ECSC&#x27; (&quot;the six&quot;: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany) joined the EEC. Seven of the remaining nations belonging to the Organization of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) which administered the Marshall Plan, did not join the EEC, but instead formed an alternative body, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). It was a free trade area as opposed to a customs union with common external tariffs and a political agenda, competing with the EEC as it was remarkably successful.

===Friendship===

With the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, West Germany sought its national security in the re-integration into Western Europe, while France sought after a reestablishment as a &quot;Grande Nation&quot;. The post-war Franco-West German cooperation is based on the Élysée Treaty, which was signed by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer on 22 January 1963. The treaty contained a number of agreements for joint cooperation in foreign policy, economic and military integration and exchange of student education.

The treaty was signed under difficult political situations at that time and criticized both by opposition parties in France and West Germany, as well as from the United Kingdom and the United States. Opposition from the United Kingdom and the United States was answered by an added preamble which postulated a close cooperation with those (including NATO) and a targeted German reunification.

The treaty achieved a lot in initiating European integration and a stronger Franco-West German co-position in transatlantic relations.

The initial concept for the Franco-German cooperation however dates back a lot further than the Élysée Treaty and is based on the overcoming the centuries of Franco-German hostilities within Europe. It was compared to a re-establishment of Charlemagne&#x27;s European empire as it existed before division by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 AD.

The Schuman declaration of 1950 is regarded by some as the founding of Franco-German cooperation, as well as of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) of 1951, which also included Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
The cooperation was accompanied by strong personal alliance in various degrees:
*Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle (1958–1963)
*Willy Brandt and Georges Pompidou (1969–1974)
*Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1974–1981)

<text>The Miniature Card or MiniCard is a flash or SRAM memory card standard first promoted by Intel in 1995. The card was backed by Advanced Micro Devices, Fujitsu and Sharp Electronics. They are no longer manufactured. The Miniature Card Implementers Forum (MCIF) promoted this standard for consumer electronics, such as PDAs and palmtops, digital audio recorders, digital cameras and early smartphones. The Miniature Card is 37 × 45 × 3.5 mm thick and can have devices on both sides of the substrate. Its 60-pin connector was a memory-only subset of PCMCIA and featured 16-bit data and 24-bit address bus with 3.3 or 5-volt signaling. Miniature Cards support Attribute Information Structure (AIS) in the I²C identification EEPROM.

The Miniature Card format competed with SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards, also released during the mid-1990s, and the earlier, larger Type I PC Cards. Ultimately, CompactFlash and SmartMedia cards were more successful in the consumer electronics market.

Olympus Digital Voice Recorder D1000 and the digital camera HP Photosmart uses the Miniature Card. Also Philips Velo 500 PDAs and CISCO 800 and 1700 used Miniature Cards.

<text>In cricket, a dismissal occurs when a batter&#x27;s innings is brought to an end by the opposing team. Other terms used are the batter being out, the batting side losing a [[wicket]], and the fielding side (and often the bowler) taking a wicket. The ball becomes dead (meaning that no further runs can be scored off that delivery), and the dismissed batter must leave the field of play for the rest of their team&#x27;s innings, to be replaced by a team-mate. A team&#x27;s innings ends if ten of the eleven team members are dismissed. Players bat in pairs so, when only one batter remains who can be not out, it is not possible for the team to bat any longer. This is known as &quot;dismissing&quot; or &quot;bowling out&quot; the batting team, who are said to be &quot;all out&quot;.

The most common methods of dismissing a batter are (in descending order of frequency): caught, bowled, leg before wicket, run out, and stumped. Of these, the leg before wicket and stumped methods of dismissal can be seen as related to, or being special cases of, the bowled and run out methods of dismissal respectively.

Most methods of dismissal do not apply on an illegal delivery (i.e. a wide or no-ball) or on the free hit delivery that follows a no-ball in certain competitions. Among the common methods of dismissal, only the &quot;run out&quot; dismissal can occur during any type of delivery.

==Purpose==
Once dismissed, a batter cannot score any more runs in that innings; thus, dismissing batters is a way for the fielding side to control the number of runs scored in an innings, and prevent the batting side from either achieving their target score or posting a large total for the fielding side to follow in the next innings. Additionally, in Test and first-class cricket, it is usually necessary for the side fielding last to dismiss ten players of the opposing team in their final innings to achieve victory (unless one or more of the batters have retired hurt or absent and are unable to take the field).

==Adjudication==
By convention, dismissal decisions are handled primarily by the players; thus, if the dismissal is obvious the batter will voluntarily leave the field without the umpire needing to dismiss them. If the batter and fielding side disagree about a dismissal then the fielding side must appeal to the umpire, who will then decide whether the batter is out. In competitive cricket, many difficult catching and LBW decisions will be left to the umpire; if a batter acknowledges that they are out in such cases and departs without waiting for the umpire&#x27;s decision it is known as &quot;walking&quot;, and regarded as an honourable but controversial act.

If the umpire believes they have incorrectly dismissed a batter, they may recall them to the crease if they have not already left the field of play. An example of this was in the 2007 Lord&#x27;s test match between England and India when Kevin Pietersen was initially given out caught behind, but was recalled when television replays showed that the ball had bounced before being taken by Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

==Methods of dismissal==
A batter can be dismissed in a number of ways, the most common being bowled, caught, leg before wicket (LBW), run out and stumped. An analysis of Test match dismissals between 1877 and 2012 found that 98.2% of the 63,584 Test match dismissals in this period were one of these five types. Much rarer were retired, hit the ball twice, hit wicket, handled the ball/obstructing the field, and timed out.

As it is possible to dismiss the non-striker, and possible to dismiss the striker from a wide (which does not count as a delivery for the batter), this means a batter can be dismissed without facing a single delivery. This is sometimes known as a diamond duck.

Len Hutton, Desmond Haynes, and Steve Waugh were each dismissed in seven different ways over the course of their test career.

===Common methods of dismissal===
====Law 32: Bowled====

If a bowler&#x27;s legitimate (i.e. not a No-ball) delivery hits the wicket and puts it down, the striker (the batter facing the bowler) is out. The ball can either have struck the stumps directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batter. However, the batter is not Bowled if the ball is touched by any other player or umpire before hitting the stumps.

Bowled takes precedence over all other methods of dismissal. What this means is, if a batter could be given out both Bowled and also for another reason, then the other reason is disregarded, and the batter is out Bowled.

Between 1877 and 2012, this method accounted for 21.4% of all Test match dismissals.

====Law 33: Caught====

If the batter hits the ball, from a legitimate delivery (i.e. not a No-Ball), with the bat (or with the glove when the glove is in contact with the bat) and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground, then the striker is out.

&quot;Caught behind&quot; (an unofficial term) indicates that a player was caught by the wicket-keeper, or less commonly by the slips. &quot;Caught and bowled&quot; indicates the bowler also took the catch.

Caught takes precedence over all other methods of dismissal except Bowled. What this means is, if a batter could be given out both Caught and also for another reason (except Bowled), then the other reason is disregarded, and the batter is out Caught.

Between 1877 and 2012, this method accounted for 56.9% of all Test match dismissals, with 40.6% caught by fielders, and 16.3% caught by the wicket-keeper.

====Law 36: Leg before wicket (lbw)====

If a bowler&#x27;s legitimate (i.e., not a No-ball) delivery strikes any part of the batter (not necessarily the leg), without first touching the bat (or glove holding the bat), and, in the umpire&#x27;s judgement, the ball would have hit the wicket but for this interception, then the striker is out. There are also further criteria that must be met, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit the batter in line with the wickets, and whether the batter was attempting to hit the ball, and these have changed over time.

Between 1877 and 2012, this method accounted for 14.3% of all Test match dismissals.

====Law 38: Run out====

A batter is Run out if at any time while the ball is in play, the wicket in the ground closest to them is fairly put down by the opposing side while no part of the batter&#x27;s bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease.

This usually happens while the batters are running between the wickets, attempting to score a run. Either the striker or non-striker can be Run out. The batter nearest the safe territory of the wicket that has been put down, but not actually in safe territory, is out. On the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batter &quot;gained their ground&quot; before the bails were removed, with the decision referred to the Decision Review System.

The difference between &quot;stumped&quot; and &quot;run out&quot; is that the wicket-keeper may stump a batter who goes too far forward to play the ball (assuming they are not attempting a run), whilst any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batter who goes too far for any other purpose, including for taking a run.

A special form of run out is when the batter at the non-striker&#x27;s end attempts to gain an advantage by leaving the crease before the next ball has been bowled (a common practice known as &quot;backing up&quot;, but against the laws of cricket). The bowler may then dislodge the bails at their end without completing the run-up and dismiss the batter. This form of run-out is sometimes called the Mankad (the dismissed batter is said to have been &quot;Mankaded&quot;), in reference to Vinoo Mankad, the first bowler to dismiss a batter in this manner in a Test match, running out Bill Brown in 1947. With changes in the Laws of Cricket, a bowler cannot Mankad a batter once they reach the point in their delivery where they would normally release the ball. It is considered good etiquette to warn a batter that he is leaving their crease early, before attempting a Mankad run out on a subsequent ball. In 2022, the ICC moved this form of dismissal from the &#x27;Unfair Play&#x27; section of the Laws of the Game to the normal &#x27;Run Out&#x27; section.

A run out cannot occur if no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batter plays a straight drive which breaks the non-striker&#x27;s stumps whilst they are outside their crease, they are not out. However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker&#x27;s end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder never has any control of the ball.

Between 1877 and 2012, this method accounted for 3.5% of all Test match dismissals.

====Law 39: Stumped====

If the striker steps in front of the crease to play the ball, leaving no part of their body or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the wicket-keeper is able to put down the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out. A stumping is most likely to be effected off slow bowling, or (less frequently) medium-paced bowling when the wicket-keeper is standing directly behind the stumps. As wicket-keepers stand several yards back from the stumps to fast bowlers, stumpings are hardly ever effected off fast bowlers. The ball can bounce off a keeper (but not external non-usual wicketkeeping protective equipment, like a helmet) and break the stumps and still be considered a stumping.

Stumped takes precedence over Run out. What this means is, if a batter could be given out both Stumped and Run out, then Run out is disregarded, and the batter is out Stumped.

Between 1877 and 2012, this method accounted for 2.0% of all Test match dismissals.

===Rare methods of dismissal===

====Law 25.4: Retired====

If any batter leaves the field of play without the Umpire&#x27;s consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, they may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If they fail to resume their innings, they are out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out is considered a dismissal.

Only two players in Test history have ever been given out in this manner: Marvan Atapattu (for 201) and Mahela Jayawardene (for 150), both in the same innings playing for Sri Lanka against Bangladesh in September 2001. Apparently, this was done in order to give the other players batting practice, but was considered unsporting and drew criticism. In May 1983, Gordon Greenidge of the West Indies retired out on 154 to visit his daughter, who was ill and who died two days later; he was subsequently judged to have retired not out, the only such decision in Test history.

There are numerous other recorded instances of batters retiring out in first-class cricket, particularly in tour matches and warm-up matches; since these matches are generally treated as practice matches, retiring out in these matches is not considered unsporting. In 1993 Graham Gooch, immediately after completing his hundredth first-class century with a six, retired on 105.

A player who retires hurt and does not return to bat by the end of the innings is not considered out for statistical purposes, though, as substitutes are not permitted to bat, the impact on play is effectively the same as if they had retired out.

====Law 34: Hit the ball twice====

If the batter &quot;hits&quot; the ball twice, they are out. The first hit is the ball striking the batter or their bat whilst the second hit is the batter intentionally making separate contact with the ball, not necessarily with the bat (it is therefore possible to be out hitting the ball twice whilst not actually hitting the ball with the bat either time). The batsman is allowed to hit the ball a second time with their bat or body (but not a hand that is not in contact with the bat) if this is performed in order to stop the ball from hitting the stumps.

No batter has been out &quot;hitting the ball twice&quot; in Test cricket. There is only one occasion in International cricket where a batter has been out &quot;Hitting the ball twice&quot;. Malta opening batter Fanyan Mughal in a Twenty20 International (T20I) match, on August 20, 2023, Romania v Malta at Ilfov County, București.

====Law 35: Hit wicket====

If the batter dislodges their own stumps with their body or bat, while in the process of taking a shot or beginning their first run, then they are out. This law does not apply if they avoided a ball thrown back to the wicket by a fielder, or broke the wicket in avoiding a run out.

This law also applies if part of the batter&#x27;s equipment is dislodged and hits the stumps: Dwayne Bravo hit Kevin Pietersen in the head with a bouncer and his helmet hit the stumps during the 2007 England vs West Indies Test match at Old Trafford; a topspinner from Richie Benaud once knocked off Joe Solomon&#x27;s cap, and the cap landed on Solomon&#x27;s stumps.

Being out hit-wicket is often seen as a comic method of dismissal. In 1991 Jonathan Agnew and Brian Johnston, commentators on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot;, got themselves into difficulty while commentating on Ian Botham&#x27;s dismissal (Botham dislodged his leg bail whilst trying to step over the stumps, having lost his balance in missing a hook shot against Curtly Ambrose), Agnew commenting that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t quite get his leg over&quot;.

A more recent example of a comic hit-wicket dismissal was during the Headingley Test match in the 2006 test series between England and Pakistan, when Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq missed a sweep against Monty Panesar, was hit in the midriff by the ball, lost his balance and collapsed on to his stumps (and nearly into wicket-keeper Chris Read).

====Law 37: Obstructing the field====

If the batter, by action or by words, obstructs or distracts the fielding side, then they are out. This law now encompasses transgressions that would previously have been covered by &quot;handled the ball&quot;, which has now been removed from the Laws.

Only one player has ever been out &quot;obstructing the field&quot; in a Test match: England&#x27;s Len Hutton, playing against South Africa at the Oval in London in 1951, knocked a ball away from his stumps but in doing so prevented South African wicket-keeper Russell Endean from completing a catch. By coincidence, Endean was one of the few people to be given out &quot;handled the ball&quot; in a Test match. In One Day International cricket, eight batters have been given out obstructing the field.

====Law 40: Timed out====

An incoming batter is &quot;timed out&quot; if they willfully take more than three minutes to be ready to face the next delivery (or be at the other end if not on strike). If a not out batter is not ready after a break in play, they can also be given out timed out on appeal. In the case of extremely long delays, the umpires may forfeit the match to either team. So far, this method of taking a wicket has never happened in the history of Test cricket and there have only been six occasions in all forms of first-class cricket. 

Angelo Mathews of Sri Lanka became the first batsman to be dismissed in this fashion in an international fixture, in a group stage match against Bangladesh in the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

===Obsolete dismissal types===

====Handled the ball====

Before the amendments of the Laws in 2017, there was a separate dismissal type of &quot;Handled the ball&quot; which is now covered by &quot;Obstructing the field&quot;.
If the batter touched the ball with a hand not in contact with the bat for any purpose other than to prevent themselves being injured or, with the approval of the fielding team, to return the ball to a fielder, they were out on appeal. It was considered good etiquette for the fielding team not to appeal if the handling of the ball did not affect the play of the game, although there have been occasions when this etiquette was ignored.

Only seven batters have been out &quot;handled the ball&quot; in the history of Test cricket, and two in One Day Internationals.

<doc id="764060" wikidata="Q185850" url="?curid=764060" title="C. R. W. Nevinson">
<text>Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson (13 August 1889 – 7 October 1946) was an English figure and landscape painter, etcher and lithographer, who was one of the most famous war artists of World War I. He is often referred to by his initials C. R. W. Nevinson, and was also known as Richard.

Nevinson studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and alongside Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, the leader of the Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other &#x27;rebel&#x27; artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.

At the outbreak of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French and British soldiers. For a very brief period he served as a volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson&#x27;s painting &quot;La Mitrailleuse&quot;, &#x27;will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.&#x27; In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson&#x27;s later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him one of the most famous young artists working in England.

Shortly after the end of the war, Nevinson travelled to the United States of America, where he painted a number of powerful images of New York. However, his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the US and Britain. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind wrote of Nevinson that &#x27;It is something, at the age of thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.&#x27; His post-war career, however, was not so distinguished. Nevinson&#x27;s 1937 memoir &quot;Paint and Prejudice&quot;, although lively and colourful, is in parts inaccurate, inconsistent, and misleading.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson was born in Hampstead, one of the two children, and the only son, of the war correspondent and journalist Henry Nevinson and the suffrage campaigner and writer Margaret Nevinson. He was always known as Richard to his friends. Educated at Shrewsbury and Uppingham, which he hated, Nevinson went on to study at the St John&#x27;s Wood School of Art. Inspired by seeing the work of Augustus John, he decided to attend the Slade School of Art, part of University College London. There his contemporaries included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Adrian Allinson and Dora Carrington. Gertler was, for a time, his closest friend and influence, and they formed for a short while a group known as the Neo-Primitives, being deeply influenced by the art of the early Renaissance. Gertler and Nevinson subsequently fell out when they both fell in love with Carrington. Whilst at the Slade, Nevinson was advised by the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, to abandon thoughts of an artistic career. This led to a lifelong bitterness between the two, and frequent accusations by Nevinson, who had something of a persecution complex, that Tonks was behind several imagined conspiracies against him. 

After leaving the Slade, Nevinson studied at the Academie Julian in Paris throughout 1912 and 1913 and also attended the Cercle Russe. In Paris, he met Vladimir Lenin and Pablo Picasso, shared a studio with Amedeo Modigliani, became acquainted with Cubism and also met the Italian Futurists Marinetti and Gino Severini. Back in London he became friends with the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis. When Wyndham Lewis founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre, which included Edward Wadsworth and Ezra Pound, Nevinson also joined. In March 1914 he was among the founder members of the London Group. In June 1914 he published, in several British newspapers, with Marinetti, a manifesto for English Futurism called &quot;Vital English Art&quot;. &quot;Vital English Art&quot; denounced the &quot;passéiste filth&quot; of the London art scene, declared Futurism as the only way of representing the modern, machine age and proclaimed its role in the vanguard of British art. Lewis was offended that Nevinson had attached the name of the Rebel Arts Centre to the manifesto without asking him or anyone else in the group. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded, though he devised the title for the Vorticists&#x27; magazine, &quot;BLAST&quot;.

=== World War One===

====Medical orderly====

At the outbreak of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and disinfect the shed and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, &quot;The Doctor&quot; and &quot;La Patrie&quot;. As the French authorities began to take control of the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.

Nevinson had four pictures included in the Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson&#x27;s Futurist painting, &quot;Returning to the Trenches&quot;, and the sculpture &quot;The Rock Drill&quot; by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances that he would not be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.

====1916====

Nevinson used his experiences in France and at the London General Hospital as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used Futurist and Cubist techniques, as well as more realistic depictions, to great effect. In March 1916 he exhibited his painting &quot;La Mitrailleuse&quot; with the Allied Artists Association at the Grafton Galleries. The artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that &quot;La Mitrailleuse&quot; &#x27;will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.&#x27;

The reaction to &quot;La Mitrailleuse&quot; prompted the Leicester Galleries to offer Nevinson a one-man show which was held in October 1916. The show was a critical and popular success and the works displayed all sold. Michael Sadler bought three paintings, Arnold Bennett bought &quot;La Patrie&quot; and Sir Alfred Mond bought &quot;A Taube&quot; which showed a child killed in Dunkirk by a bomb thrown from a type of German plane known as a Taube. Several famous writers and politicians visited the exhibition; it received extensive press coverage and Nevinson became something of a celebrity.

====Official war artist====
In April 1917, with the support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d&#x27;Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.

When he returned to London in August 1917, Nevinson first completed six lithographs on the subject of &quot;Building Aircraft&quot; for the War Propaganda Bureau portfolio of pictures, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Efforts and Ideals&quot;, and then spent seven months in his Hampstead studio working up his sketches from the Front into finished pieces. A number of officials from the Department of Information visited the studio and soon began complaining about these new works. Nevinson was now focused on individuals, either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare. He did this by painting in a realistic manner using a limited colour palette, sometimes only mud-brown or khaki. Whereas for his 1916 exhibition Nevinson had displayed both realistic works and pieces using Cubist and Futurist techniques, for his 1918 exhibition all the works were realistic in style and composition.

Not only did the Department of Information art advisors consider these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting &quot;The Road from Arras to Bapaume&quot; but was not prepared to compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to &quot;A Group of Soldiers&quot; on the grounds that &quot;the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army&quot;. Amid the sarcasm and vitriol of Nevinson&#x27;s response, he did make the point that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, Nevinson&#x27;s painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word &#x27;Censored&#x27; scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word &#x27;Censored&#x27; without authorisation.

====Hall of Remembrance Commission====

In 1918, after some negotiation, Nevinson agreed to work for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary commission as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.

While on the trip, he did sketch a line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making their way to the rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the painting &quot;The Harvest of Battle&quot; which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a &#x27;private view&#x27; of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge &quot;The Nation&#x27;s War Paintings and Drawings&quot; exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons&#x27; outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.

===Post-war career===
Nevinson, alongside Edward Elgar and H. G. Wells represented British culture at the celebrations of the first anniversary of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel &amp; Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting &quot;New York-an abstraction&quot; to &quot;The Soul of the Soulless City&quot;. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.

Nevinson&#x27;s boasting and exaggerated claims concerning his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the US and Britain. Roger Fry of the Bloomsbury Group was a particularly virulent critic. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of Nevinson&#x27;s recent work: &#x27;It is something, at the age of thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.&#x27; In September 1920, Nevinson designed a poster for a production, by Viola Tree, of &quot;The Unknown&quot; by Somerset Maugham which showed bombs exploding around a crucifix. The image was deemed to be offensive and was banned from display on the London Underground. Nevinson distributed the poster outside the theatre and gained a great deal of press coverage in the process.
Throughout the 1930s Nevinson painted a number of cityscapes in London, Paris and New York which were generally well received. The most notable of these is &quot;The Strand by Night&quot; from 1937. The same year, he illustrated the cover of the edition of &quot;Radio Times&quot;, marking the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. His post-war work generally included landscapes in a more naturalist style. A sunlit landscape design by Nevinson was among the winning entries in the 1933 &quot;Famous Artists&quot; competition run by Cadbury&#x27;s for a series of chocolate box designs and which were displayed at the Leicester Galleries in London. His large painting of 1932 and 1933, &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot; used futurist devices to attack Fascism and Nazism. He also produced large historic allegories which were considered inferior to his World War One paintings. Kenneth Clark, then the Director of the National Gallery, made some comments on these lines and, in return, Nevinson became a fierce critic of Clark. Nevinson was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur in 1938 and was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1939.

===World War Two===

At the start of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, WAAC, and appointed Kenneth Clark as its chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clark and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout The Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead were hit by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, &quot;Anti-aircraft Defences&quot; and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, &quot;The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record&quot;.

Nevinson obtained a commission from the Royal Air Force to portray airmen preparing for the Dieppe raid in August 1942 and they also allowed him to fly in their planes to develop pictures of the air war. He presented a painting, a cloudscape entitled &quot;The Battlefields of Britain&quot;, to Winston Churchill as a gift to the nation and which still hangs in Downing Street. Shortly afterwards a stroke paralysed his right hand and caused a speech impediment. He applied for a junior clerical post with WAAC and was refused. Nevinson taught himself to paint with his left hand and had three pictures shown at the Royal Academy in the summer of 1946. He attended that exhibition, with the assistance of his wife Kathleen, in a wheelchair but died a few months later aged fifty-seven.

<text>Harry Stewart New (December 31, 1858 – May 9, 1937) was a U.S. politician, journalist, and Spanish–American War veteran. He served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee, a United States senator from Indiana, and United States Postmaster General.

==Biography==
Harry Stewart New was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on December 31, 1858, the son of John C. New and Melissa (Beeler) New. His father served as Treasurer of the United States and his uncle, Jeptha D. New, was a U.S. Representative. He attended Butler University before going to work for the &quot;Indianapolis Journal&quot; where he was a reporter, editor, part owner, and publisher from 1878 to 1903. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He served in the Indiana State Senate from 1896 to 1900 and served in the Spanish–American War as captain and assistant adjutant general of the 7th Army Corps. He was a member of the Republican National Committee from 1900 to 1912, serving as chairman from 1907 to 1908, and later engaged in the stone quarrying and construction business.

New returned to politics with his election to the United States Senate in 1916, defeating incumbent John W. Kern. In the Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on Territories and the Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions. He was also a &quot;wet&quot; or an anti-prohibitionist, and in August 1919 introduced early legislation proposing an independent United States Air Force.


In late March 1922, New became the first senator to use radio in his campaign—at that time, broadcasting a political speech was not widely done by candidates. His speech was transmitted by a U.S. Navy station, NOF in Washington, D.C., which immediately caused a complaint by Democrats about a government station being used for partisan purposes. This in turn quickly led to a ban on further use of the station for political activities.

New was defeated by Albert J. Beveridge for renomination in 1922 who lost the general election to Samuel M. Ralston. He was then appointed Postmaster General in the cabinet of President Warren G. Harding in 1923 and was reappointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1925.

After the end of the Coolidge Administration, New retired from active business pursuits and resided in Washington, D.C. In 1933, he was appointed a United States Commissioner to the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. He died in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 9, 1937, and was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

<text>The London Gold Fixing (or Gold Fix) is the setting of the price of gold that takes place via a dedicated conference line. It was formerly held on the London premises of Nathan Mayer Rothschild &amp; Sons by the members of The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd.

The benchmark is determined twice each business day of the London bullion market (the exceptions to this being Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve when there is only one fixing in the morning). It is designed to fix a price for settling contracts between members of the London bullion market, but the gold fixing informally provides a recognized rate that is used as a benchmark for pricing the majority of gold products and derivatives throughout the world&#x27;s markets. The LBMA gold price is set twice every business day at 10:30AM and 3:00PM, London time, in United States dollars (USD). Prices are available in sixteen other currencies—including British pounds, Canadian dollars, Chinese renminbi, and euros—but they are indicative prices for settlement between LBMA members only.

The current 14 participants in the fixing are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Coins &#x27;N Things, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, INTL FCStone, Jane Street Global Trading, HSBC Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase, Koch Supply and Trading, Marex Financial, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

==History==
On 12 September 1919 at 11:00 am, the five principal gold bullion traders and refiners of the day (N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, Pixley &amp; Abell, Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., and Sharps Wilkins) performed the first London gold fixing, thus becoming the five founding members. The gold price was determined to be £4 18/9 (GBP 4.9375) per troy ounce. The New York gold price was US$19.39. The first few fixings were conducted by telephone until the members started meeting at the Rothschild offices in New Court, St Swithin&#x27;s Lane.

In 1933, Executive Order 6102 was signed by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, requiring US citizens to turn in their gold for $20.67 per ounce. Afterwards, the price of gold was set at $35.00 per ounce.

Due to wartime emergencies and government controls, the London gold fixing was suspended between 1939 and 1954, when the London gold market was closed.

On 21 January 1980 the gold fixing reached the price of $850, a figure not surpassed until 3 January 2008 when a new record of $865.35 per troy ounce was set in the a.m. fixing. However, when indexed for inflation, the 1980 high corresponds to a price of $2,305.18 in 2011 dollars, thus the 1980 record still holds in real terms.

The fixing historically took place at the London offices of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in St Swithin&#x27;s Lane, but since 5 May 2004 it takes place by a dedicated telephone conferencing system. This was necessary as some banks moved their London operations away from the Bank of England towards areas such as Canary Wharf. Until 1968, the price was fixed only once a day, when a second fixing was introduced at 3 p.m. to coincide with the opening of the US markets, as the price of gold was no longer under control of the Bank of England, a result of the collapse of the London Gold Pool.

In April 2004, N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons announced that it planned to withdraw from gold trading and from the London gold fixing. Barclays Capital took its place on 7 June 2004 and the chairmanship of the meeting, formerly held permanently by Rothschilds, now rotates annually.

On 28 June 2012, an employee of Barclays manipulated the gold fixing process to prevent a derivative product previously sold to a client from leading to a payout. The employee, and subsequently Barclays, self-reported the incident.

In January 2014, Deutsche Bank withdrew from the panels setting the gold and silver fixings.

On 23 May 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority announced it had fined Barclays £26 million for systems and controls failures, and conflict of interest in relation to the gold fixing over the nine years to 2013, and for manipulation of the gold price on 28 June 2012.

==Process==

The five participating banks are market makers. They may have gold orders on their own behalf (proprietary trading), their clients&#x27; behalf (brokerage), or frequently some of each. A sell limit order is not executed unless the price is above a preset value. A buy limit order is not executed unless the price is below a preset value.

The lead participant will begin the fixing process by proposing a price near the current gold spot price. The participants then simulate the result of trading at that price. The simulations do not merely factor physical gold, but include gold trading contracts (&quot;Paper Gold&quot;) which are marginally backed and which therefore inflate market volumes and alter the supply/demand valuation formulas that would otherwise apply to the physical gold commodity.

First, each bank looks at its limit orders and determines how many are eligible to trade at that price. They can also consider how much gold their proprietary trading desk would trade at the same price. The bank then states a single value, the net amount (in ounces) of gold they wish to buy or sell. After each bank provides this value, they determine if the overall net amount is zero. If so, all transactions succeed and the fix is complete. The chair then states, &quot;There are no flags, and we&#x27;re fixed.&quot;

Otherwise, the chair must change the proposed price. If the amount of gold the banks proposed to buy is higher than the amount proposed for sale, he must raise the price. That will decrease the number of proposed purchases, both because more buy limit orders will fail and because of proprietary traders. At the same time, it increases the number of proposed sales, both because more sell limit orders succeed and because of proprietary trading.

Conversely, if the amount proposed for sale is higher, he must lower the price. This will have the exact opposite effects from above, increasing the number of proposed purchases and decreasing the number of proposed sales.

This process iterates until a fix is found. Buyers are charged 20 cents per troy ounce as a premium to fund the fix process; this results in an implicit bid–ask spread.

As with other forms of market making, participants attempt to predict the direction of the market and increase profits through timing.

Participants can pause proceedings at will. Originally, it was done by raising a small Union Jack on their desk. Under the telephone fixing system, participants can register a pause by saying the word &quot;flag.&quot;

<doc id="764071" wikidata="Q2781883" url="?curid=764071" title="Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall">
<text>Marshal of the Royal Air Force Cyril Louis Norton Newall, 1st Baron Newall, (15 February 1886 – 30 November 1963) was a senior officer of the British Army and Royal Air Force. He commanded units of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force in the First World War, and served as Chief of the Air Staff during the first years of the Second World War. From 1941 to 1946 he was the Governor-General of New Zealand.

Born to a military family, Newall studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before taking a commission as a junior officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1905. After transferring to the 2nd Gurkha Rifles in the Indian Army, he saw active service on the North West Frontier, but after learning to fly in 1911 turned towards a career in military aviation. During the First World War he rose from flying instructor to command of 41st Wing RFC, the main strategic bombing force, and was awarded the Albert Medal for putting out a fire in an explosives store.

He served in staff positions through the 1920s and was Air Officer Commanding the Middle East Command in the early 1930s before becoming Air Member for Supply and Organisation in 1935. Newall was appointed Chief of the Air Staff in 1937 and, in that role, supported sharp increases in aircraft production, increasing expenditure on the new, heavily armed, Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, essential to re-equip Fighter Command. He was sacked after the Battle of Britain after political intrigue caused him to lose Churchill&#x27;s confidence. In 1941 he was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand, holding office until 1946.

==Early life==
Newall was born to Lieutenant Colonel William Potter Newall and Edith Gwendoline Caroline Newall (née Norton). After education at Bedford School, he attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After leaving Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 16 August 1905. He was promoted to lieutenant on 18 November 1908, and transferred to the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles on 16 September 1909. He served on the North-West Frontier, where he first encountered his future colleague Hugh Dowding; at an exercise in 1909, Dowding&#x27;s artillery section ambushed Newall&#x27;s Gurkhas whilst they were still breakfasting.

Newall began to turn towards a career in aviation in 1911, when he learned to fly in a Bristol Biplane at Larkhill whilst on leave in England. He held certificate No. 144 issued by the Royal Aero Club. He later passed a formal course at the Central Flying School, Upavon in 1913, and began working as a pilot trainer there from 17 November 1913; it was intended that he would form part of a flight training school to be established in India, but he had not yet left England when the First World War broke out.

==First World War==

On the outbreak of war, Newall was in England. On 12 September 1914, he was given the temporary rank of captain, and attached to the Royal Flying Corps as a flight commander, to serve with No. 1 Squadron on the Western Front. He was promoted to the permanent rank of captain on 22 September, effective from 16 August. On 24 March 1915 he was promoted to major and appointed to command No. 12 Squadron, flying BE2c aircraft in France from September onwards. The squadron took part in the Battle of Loos, bombing railways and carrying out reconnaissance missions in October 1915.

On taking command of the squadron, he chose to stop flying personally in order to concentrate on administration, a decision which was regarded dismissively by his men; relations were strained until January 1916, when he demonstrated his courage by walking into a burning bomb store to try to control a fire. He was awarded the Albert Medal for this act on the personal recommendation of General Hugh Trenchard, and in February 1916 was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of Training No. 6 Wing in England. In December 1916 he took command of No. 9 Wing in France, a long-range bomber and reconnaissance formation, and in October 1917 took command of the newly formed No. 41 Wing. This was upgraded as the 8th Brigade in December, with Newall promoted accordingly to the temporary rank of brigadier-general on 28 December 1917. During 1918, it joined the Independent Bombing Force, which was the main strategic bombing arm of the newly formed Royal Air Force. In June 1918 Newall was appointed the Deputy Commander of the Independent Bombing Force, serving under Trenchard.

Newall was awarded the Croix d&#x27;Officier of the French Legion of Honour on 10 October 1918, and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919, a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 3 June 1919 and an Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 18 April 1921.
==Between the wars==

Newall was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1919 and promoted to group captain on 8 August 1919. He became deputy director of Personnel at the Air Ministry in August 1919 and then Deputy Commandant of the apprentices&#x27; technical training school in August 1922. He married Mary Weddell in 1922; she died in September 1924, and he remarried the following year to Olive Foster, an American woman. He had three children with Foster, a son and two daughters.

Newall was promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1925, and took command of the newly formed Auxiliary Air Force in May 1925. He was appointed to a League of Nations disarmament committee in December 1925 and then became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Director of Operations and Intelligence on 12 April 1926. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1929 Birthday Honours and, having been promoted to air vice marshal on 1 January 1930, he stood down as Deputy Chief on 6 February 1931. He became Air Officer Commanding Wessex Bombing Area in February 1931 and then Air Officer Commanding Middle East Command in September 1931. He then returned to the Air Ministry, where he became Air Member for Supply and Organisation on 14 January 1935, during the beginnings of the pre-war expansion and rearmament. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1935 Birthday Honours and promoted to air marshal on 1 July 1935. He attended the funeral of King George V in January 1936.

Philosophically, Newall remained a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; his time in the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its &quot;presence&quot; could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937.

==Chief of the Air Staff==

On 1 September 1937, Newall was appointed as Chief of the Air Staff, the military head of the RAF, in succession to Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that he was expected to be appointed as the new Chief of the Air Staff. The decision was taken by the Air Minister, Viscount Swinton, without consulting Ellington for advice.
During 1936 and 1937, the Air Staff had been fighting with the Cabinet over the rearmament plans; the Air Staff wanted a substantial bomber force and only minor increases in fighters, whilst the Minister for Defence Co-ordination, Thomas Inskip, successfully pushed for a greater role for the fighter force. Newall was promoted during the middle of this debate, and proved perhaps more flexible than might have been expected. In 1938 he supported sharp increases in aircraft production, including double-shift working and duplication of factories, and pushed for the creation of a dedicated organisation to repair and refit damaged aircraft. He supported expenditure on the new, heavily armed, Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, essential to re-equip Fighter Command. He even began to distance himself, albeit slightly, from orthodox bomber philosophy, noting to the Minister for Air that &quot;no one can say with absolute certainty that a nation can be knocked out from the air, because no-one has yet attempted it&quot;. Discussing plans for reacting to a war with Italy, in early 1939, he opposed a French proposal to force Italy&#x27;s surrender by the use of heavy bombing raids against the north, arguing that it would be unlikely to force the country out of the war without the need for ground combat.

Newall was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1938 Birthday Honours. He was still Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939; his main contribution to the war effort was his successful resistance to the transfer of fighter squadrons to aid the collapsing French thus preserving a large portion of Fighter Command which would become crucial during the Battle of Britain. While he remained committed to the idea of a &quot;knock-out blow&quot; offensive by Bomber Command, he also recognised that it was too weak to do so successfully, but still strongly opposed the use of the RAF for close air support.

Following the end of the Battle of Britain, Newall was quickly forced into retirement and replaced as Chief of the Air Staff by Charles Portal. Contemporaries attributed this to the effects of overwork, which had certainly taken its toll, but there were also other aspects; Newall had lost political support, particularly following a dispute with Lord Beaverbrook over the control of aircraft production and repair. Matters came to a head with the circulation of an anonymous memo attacking Newall, among other senior officers, as &quot;a real weakness to the RAF and to the nation&#x27;s defences&quot;. The author was Air Commodore Edgar McCloughry, a disaffected staff officer who saw himself as passed over for promotion and who had been brought into Beaverbrook&#x27;s inner circle. Beaverbrook pressed Churchill to dismiss Newall, gaining the support of influential ex-RAF figures such as Trenchard and Salmond. Trenchard had come out against Newall for his failure to launch a decisive strategic bombing offensive, while Salmond saw Newall&#x27;s removal as the simplest way to replace Dowding as head of Fighter Command – despite Newall having also sought to sack Dowding.

He was promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 4 October 1940 and retired from the RAF later that month. He was awarded the Order of Merit on 29 October, and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 21 November.

==New Zealand and later life==

In February 1941 Newall was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand, a post he would hold for the remainder of the war. His time there was mostly quiet – described by one biographer as &quot;a nice long rest&quot; – and he toured the country extensively, referring to the war &quot;in every public address&quot;. Newall and his wife, who also carried out an extensive program of engagements, were broadly popular, but there were occasional tensions; shortly after his arrival, it was widely (but mistakenly) rumoured that he had slighted the &quot;men&quot; of the Army in favour of the &quot;gentlemen&quot; of the RNZAF in a speech. A Freemason, Newall became Grand Master of New Zealand&#x27;s Grand Lodge while Governor-General.

Politically, he had a lukewarm relationship with the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser – &quot;I can&#x27;t persuade myself that he is all he quite appears to be&quot;, Newall noted in a private report – but the two worked together effectively. Small problems occasionally flared up, such as that in October 1942, when Fraser was reprimanded for not personally informing Newall of the resignation of four ministers. However, only one developed into a direct confrontation, when Newall became the last Governor-General to refuse to follow the advice of his cabinet. Newall was presented with a government recommendation to remit four prisoners sentenced to be flogged, but refused to do so. He argued that if the government was opposed to flogging, it should repeal the legislation rather than maintain a policy of always remitting the sentences. This would be constitutionally improper, as it meant that the executive was overriding the legislature, which had provided for the sentence, and the judiciary, which had given it. Fraser, and his deputy Walter Nash, refused to accept this response, and the impasse stretched out for several days; in the end, a compromise was reached where Newall remitted the sentences but the government undertook to repeal the legislation. The repeal bill was then extended to cover capital punishment as well; the government had the same policy to always remit, and it was felt that both had to be handled in the same way.

A second conflict emerged just before the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.

Following his return from New Zealand in 1946, Newall was raised to the peerage as Baron Newall, of Clifton upon Dunsmoor, in the county of Warwick. He spoke in the House of Lords rarely, making five speeches between 1946 and 1948 and one in 1959, mostly addressing defence issues. Newall died at his home at Welbeck Street in London on 30 November 1963, at which time his son Francis inherited his title.

Newall is buried with his wife Olive at St Mary Magdalene in Tormarton, South Gloucestershire.

<text>The Lewis and Clark River is a tributary of Youngs River, approximately long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains of the Northern Oregon Coast Range in the extreme northwest corner of the state, entering Youngs River just above its mouth on the Columbia River at Youngs Bay. Near the river&#x27;s mouth is the site of former Fort Clatsop of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The river is named for Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.

==History and parks==
The river was called the Netul River by Lewis and Clark and the Native American Clatsop people who were living in the area at the time. It continued to be known as the Netul River until 1925, when it was renamed to honor Lewis and Clark. The river flows through Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, which was designated as a National Historical Park in 2004.

==Fish==
The river is home to bottom-feeding white sturgeon, which is a sport fish in the area. It is also home to an extensive salmon repopulation program, just outside Astoria, Oregon proper, that is currently run by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The salmon fry, called &quot;fingerlings&quot; can be seen writhing and jumping within their net-lined pens along the river&#x27;s eastern banks. The river also supports runs of wild steelhead and cutthroat trout.

<text>John Strong Newberry (December 22, 1822 – December 7, 1892) was an American physician, geologist and paleontologist. He participated as a naturalist and surgeon on three expeditions to explore and survey the western United States. During the Civil War he served in the US Sanitary Commission and was appointed secretary of the western department of the commission. After the war he became professor of geology and paleontology at Columbia University School of Mines and chief geologist of the Geological Survey of Ohio.

==Biography==
John Strong Newberry was born in Windsor, Connecticut, to Henry and Elizabeth Strong. At the age of two he moved with his family to northeastern Ohio where his father opened a coal mining business. The fossils found in the coal deposits stimulated his interest in science and a visit in 1841 with James Hall, an eminent geologist and paleontologist, furthered his interests. He graduated from Western Reserve College in 1846 and from Cleveland Medical School in 1848. That same year he married Sarah Gaylord and sailed with her to Paris where he spent the next two years of studying medicine and natural history. Upon his return in 1851, he established a successful medical practice in Cleveland.

In 1855, he joined an exploring expedition under Lieutenant Williamson, sent out by the War Department to examine the country between San Francisco and the Columbia River. In 1857–58 he acted as geologist to an expedition headed by Lieutenant Joseph Christmas Ives, sent out to explore the Colorado River. He served as naturalist on an expedition in 1859 under Captain John N. Macomb, which explored southwestern Colorado and adjacent parts of Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, finding the remains of the dinosaur &quot;Dystrophaeus&quot;. He was the first geologist known to visit the Grand Canyon. He was called to a professorship at Columbian (now George Washington) University in 1857. Newberry was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1860.

On 14 June 1861, he was elected a member of the United States Sanitary Commission due to his medical knowledge and experience in the army. He made his first sanitary inspection of troops in the west at Cairo, Illinois, in connection with Rev. Henry W. Bellows and Dr. William H. Mussey. In September 1861, he resigned from the Army and became secretary of the Western Department of the Sanitary Commission, having supervision of all the work of the commission in the Mississippi Valley, with headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky.

The first distributing depot in the west was opened in Wheeling, West Virginia, on 8 October and was the source from which the hospitals at Wheeling, Clarksburg, Parkersburg, and other military points were supplied with a large part of their equipment. Dr. Newberry organized the whole of the comprehensive machinery of the commission in the large section that was committed to his care, and by his practical suggestions and enthusiasm stimulated the formation of the tributary societies. From 1 September 1861 until 1 July 1866, he expended more than $800,000 in money, and distributed hospital stores that were valued at more than $5,000,000. During this time the names of more than 850,000 soldiers were collected and recorded in the hospital directory in Louisville, and food and shelter were given in the various homes of the commission to more than 1,000,000 soldiers, for whom no other adequate provision was made.

In 1866 he was offered the chair of geology and paleontology in the School of Mines, Columbia College (now Columbia University), which he accepted and held for 24 years. During his connection with this institution, he created a museum of over 100,000 specimens, principally collected by himself, which served to illustrate his lectures in paleontology and economic geology. At that time, it contained the best representations of the mineral resources of the United States to be found anywhere, as well as many unique and remarkable fossils. Much of this collection was later incorporated in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History.

His other positions were: chief geologist of the Geological Survey of Ohio; a member of the Illinois Geological Survey; president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; president of the New York Academy of Sciences; and president of the Torrey Botanical Club. During the World&#x27;s fair in Philadelphia in 1876 he was one of the judges. In 1887, he was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1867, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He assisted in the organization of the Geological Society of America at Cleveland in 1888, and served on the commission to organize an international geological congress, of which he was president in 1891. The Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London was awarded to him in 1888.

Newberry died at New Haven on December 7, 1892.

==Legacy==
Newberry Crater, Oregon (now in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument) was named in his honor in 1903.

Newberry Butte, located within the Grand Canyon, was named in his honor in 1906.

A fish, &quot;Eucyclogobius newberryi&quot;, the Northern tidewater goby was named in his honor.

==Works==
Dr. Newberry&#x27;s separate papers contributed to various periodicals included upward of 200 titles, chiefly in the fields of geology and paleontology, but also in zoology and botany. Newberry named more than 50 species of Paleozoic age fossil vertebrates and plants, some of which have been subsequently synonymized or renamed because of homonymy.

<text>Truman Handy Newberry (November 5, 1864 – October 3, 1945) was an American businessman and political figure. He served as the Secretary of Navy between 1908 and 1909. He was a Republican U.S. Senator from Michigan between 1919 and 1922.

==Biography==
Newberry was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of John Stoughton Newberry (a U.S. Representative from Michigan) and his second wife, Helen P. Handy, the daughter of Truman P. Handy, a well-known financier and banker in Cleveland. Newberry attended Michigan Military Academy before graduating from Yale College&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall in 1885.

==Career==
After college Newberry became superintendent of construction, paymaster, general freight and passenger agent, and eventually manager of the Detroit, Bay City &amp; Alpena Railway from 1885 to 1887. He was then president and treasurer of the Detroit Steel &amp; Spring Company from 1887 to 1901. In 1902, he helped organize the Packard Motor Car Company. He engaged in various other manufacturing activities, including the Union Trust Company, the Union Elevator Company, and the Michigan State Telephone Company.

In 1893, Newberry joined with others to organize the Michigan State Naval Brigade, serving as landsman in 1895; lieutenant and navigator in 1897 and 1898. He was commissioned lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Navy in May 1898 and served on the during the Spanish–American War. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy 1905–1908 under President Theodore Roosevelt and acted for the ill secretary Victor H. Metcalf, who resigned November 13, 1908. Newberry was appointed Secretary of the Navy on December 1, 1908, and served until March 5, 1909. He became lieutenant commander United States Navy Fleet Reserve, June 6, 1917, and was assistant to the commandant of the Third Naval District headquartered in New York City until January 9, 1919.

==Politics==
He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1919, until his resignation on November 18, 1922. In 1921, Newberry was tried and convicted under the Federal Corrupt Practices Act for election &quot;irregularities&quot;. The conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court in &quot;Newberry v. United States&quot;, and following an investigation the Senate declared Newberry entitled to his seat but expressed disapproval of the sum spent in his race against automaker Henry Ford. In the face of a new movement to unseat him, Newberry resigned. He was replaced in the Senate by James J. Couzens, whose candidacy received the approval of then Governor Alexander Groesbeck. Thereafter, Newberry engaged in manufacturing. He died in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

<text>John Newbery (9 July 1713 – 22 December 1767), considered &quot;The Father of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, was an English publisher of books who first made children&#x27;s literature a sustainable and profitable part of the literary market. He also supported and published the works of Christopher Smart, Oliver Goldsmith and Samuel Johnson. In recognition of his achievements the Newbery Medal was named after him in 1922.

==Early life==
Newbery was born in 1713 to Robert Newbery, a farmer, in Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire, England, and an unknown mother. When he was younger he gave himself an education. He was apprenticed to a local printer, William Ayers, at the age of sixteen. The business was later sold to William Carnan. In 1737 Carnan died, leaving the business to his brother, Charles Carnan, and Newbery. Two years later, Newbery married William Carnan&#x27;s widow, Jordan Mary. He adopted Mary&#x27;s three children, John, Thomas and Anna-Maria. In 1740 their daughter Mary was born. John, born in 1741, died at age 11. Son Francis arrived in 1743.
==Publishing career==

By 1740 Newbery had started his publishing business in Reading. His first two publications were an edition of Richard Allestree&#x27;s &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous Works Serious and Humerous [sic] In Verse and Prose&quot;. In 1743, Newbery left Reading, putting his stepson John Carnan in charge of his business there, and established a shop in London, first at the sign of the Bible and Crown near Devereux Court. He published several adult books, but he became interested in expanding his business to children&#x27;s books. His first children&#x27;s book, &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot;, appeared 18 July 1744. &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; is the first in Newbery&#x27;s successful line of children&#x27;s books. The book cost six pence but for an extra two the purchaser received a red and black ball or pincushion. Newbery, like John Locke, believed that play was a better enticement to children&#x27;s good behaviour than physical discipline, and the child was to record their behaviour by either sticking a pin in the red side for good behaviour or the black side if they were bad. &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot;, though it would seem didactic today, was well received. Promising to &quot;infallibly make Tommy a good boy and Polly a good girl&quot;, it had poems, proverbs and an alphabet song. The book was child sized with a brightly coloured cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursor to the toy books popular in the nineteenth century. In developing his particular brand of children&#x27;s literature, Newbery borrowed techniques from other publishers, such as binding his books in Dutch floral paper and advertising his other products and books within the stories he wrote or commissioned. This improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children&#x27;s books in his time.

In 1745 Newbery moved his firm to a more upmarket address at 65 St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard and named it the Bible and Sun, continuing to publish a mix of adult and children&#x27;s titles. This new shop did so well he eventually sold the Reading business. His success allowed his son Francis to attend both Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Jan Susina, writing in &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn&quot; says &quot;Newbery&#x27;s genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children&#x27;s books, through his frequent advertisements ... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children&#x27;s books.&quot;

About one-fifth of the five hundred books Newbery produced were children&#x27;s stories, including ABC books, children&#x27;s novels and children&#x27;s magazines. He published his own books as well as those by authors like Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith. Scholars have speculated that Goldsmith or Giles and Griffith Jones wrote &quot;The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes&quot;, Newbery&#x27;s most popular book. It had 29 editions between 1765 and 1800. Some sources credit Newbery with publishing the first edition of Mother Goose in England, but others now say the book may have been planned, but was never actually produced. Newbery also published a series of books written by &quot;Tom Telescope&quot; that were wildly popular, going through seven editions between 1761 and 1787 alone. These were based on the emerging science of the day and consisted of a series of lectures given by a boy, Tom Telescope. The most famous is &quot;The Newtonian System of Philosophy Adapted to the Capacities of Young Gentlemen and Ladies&quot;.

John Newbery died 22 December 1767, at his house in St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard. He is buried in his birthplace of Waltham Saint Lawrence.

==Patent medicine==

Newbery&#x27;s prosperity did not just come from publishing; he was one of the most successful merchants in England at the time. Some of his fortunes came from the patent and sales of Dr Robert James&#x27;s Fever Powder, a medicine which claimed to cure gout, rheumatism, scrofula, scurvy, leprosy, and distemper in cattle. This product became successful due in part to Newbery&#x27;s advertisements for it in his literature. In &quot;Goody Two-Shoes&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s father dies because he was &quot;seized with a violent fever in a place where Dr. James Fever Powder was not to be had.&quot;

Newbery used his fortune to help writers through financial difficulties. Those he is known to have assisted include Johnson, who called him &quot;Jack Whirler&quot; for his constant activity and inability to sit still; and Goldsmith, who portrayed Newbery in &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; as Dr Primrose, &quot;the friend of all mankind&quot;.

==Newbery&#x27;s themes==

Locke had written that &quot;children may be cozened [tricked] into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipped for.&quot; He also suggested that picture books be created for children. Locke also argued that children should be considered &quot;reasoning beings.&quot; Newbery acted upon these suggestions. &quot;A Pretty Little Pocket-Book&quot; was a hodge-podge of information and games, including riddles and advice on a proper diet, but its primary message was &quot;learn your lessons ... and one day you will ride in a coach and six.&quot; &quot;In Newbery&#x27;s universe work is always rewarded and altruism pays dividends as reliably as Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.&quot;

Newbery&#x27;s tales seem didactic today, but were popular and enjoyed by children of the 18th and 19th centuries. They draw the world as a meritocracy where a child rises or falls on his or her character. Most of his stories concern a virtuous orphan who works hard (or is &quot;industrious&quot;), and therefore eventually becomes prosperous. They tell the life of the orphan from childhood to adulthood, to illustrate rewards and punishments associated with &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; behaviour.

==Legacy==

His son Francis, his stepson Thomas Carnan, his nephew Francis and Francis&#x27;s wife Elizabeth and his grandson Francis Power continued the business after his death, though with less cooperation than John Newbery had anticipated; the son and stepson frequently differentiated themselves from the nephew through their imprints, and had a less than cordial relationship between each other as well. Francis (nephew) struck out on his own without legally inheriting any of John Newbery&#x27;s publications, only a share of his newspaper interests. Nevertheless, he persevered, and upon his death in 1780, his widow Elizabeth inherited the firm through his will. Elizabeth carried on a successful, independent twenty-two year career, retiring in 1802 by selling the business to her successor, John Harris.

In 1922, the John Newbery Medal was created by the American Library Association in his honour; it is awarded each year to the &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;.

==Bestselling Newbery books==

<text>TheBus is the public bus transportation service on the island of Oʻahu, Hawai&#x27;i, in the United States. In , TheBus had a ridership of , or about per weekday, and its fleet comprised 518 buses and 207 paratransit vehicles. As of June 2024, these vehicles provide daily service on 115 routes, including three rapid transit routes and two limited express routes. All buses are equipped with bike racks. TheBus is privately managed by the nonprofit Oahu Transit Services Inc., which operates the system under a public-private partnership with the City and County of Honolulu&#x27;s Department of Transportation Services.

As of December 2017, TheBus is the nation&#x27;s most heavily used public transportation system per capita among major cities.

== History ==
=== Origins: Honolulu Rapid Transit ===

TheBus&#x27; origin was The Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company, which operated buses and trolley lines mostly in the Honolulu district, while most outlying areas were serviced by competing bus companies. Honolulu Rapid Transit (HRT) was founded on June 6, 1898, the same day that Hawaiʻi was annexed by the United States. HRT started streetcar operations in Honolulu in 1901. HRT operated streetcars from 1901 to 1941, motor buses continually from 1925 onward, and trolleybuses from 1937 to 1957.

Various issues caused its failure, including a series of strikes by union workers and reports of a hostile takeover of the company by Harry Weinberg in 1955, after he began buying up other properties in Hawaiʻi. Weinberg acquired HRT from the Castle family in 1959.

=== Public acquisition ===
By the 1960s, HRT was associated with prolonged labor strikes that at times left passengers without bus service for more than 60 days, including a 67-day strike in 1967 and a 60-day strike in 1971. The City &amp; County of Honolulu considered acquiring HRT and its competitors, keeping with the trend as more cities in the United States were taking over operations of privately owned bus companies; the United States Department of Transportation informed Honolulu in August 1970 that it would fund of the cost to acquire three private lines: HRT, Leeward Bus, and Wahiawa Transport. On September 14, 1970, and under the guidance of then-Mayor of Honolulu Frank Fasi, the city established Mass Transit Lines (MTL) Limited to oversee operations. After careful negotiations the city agreed to purchase HRT (and its competitors serving the other portions of O&#x27;ahu) for a $2 million down payment and an additional $1 million to buy new buses.

Fasi later went to Dallas, Texas and bought 50 ex-Dallas Transit System air-conditioned GM New Look buses (model TDH5303, built in 1964), followed by adding 17 new New Looks (T6H5305A 500-509 and T6M5305A ) from GM&#x27;s Pontiac, Michigan plant. The 50 ex-Dallas buses were renumbered 550-599 and retained their original Dallas livery. Since the original Dallas colors were similar to the old HRT colors, the ex-Dallas buses did not look totally out of place; however, they were eventually repainted to match the new paint scheme. The ex-Dallas buses were all retired by 1987, but some were purchased by and served for private lines until 1993.

On February 25, 1971, the city council officially approved a contract for MTL to take over operations. Several days later, on March 1, HRT was renamed TheBus. In addition to changing the paint scheme, MTL made the system friendlier by also relaxing the standard uniform, introducing the current short-sleeve shirts featuring TheBus logo, buses, and slogans. Fasi introduced the &quot;new-identity apparel&quot; in 1974, hoping to change the bus system&#x27;s stodgy, old image to a fresher, more fun one that would help lure more drivers out of their cars. These uniforms, which are updated every 2–3 years, have become collectors&#x27; items.

MTL was dissolved in 1992 after the city switched bus system administration to Oahu Transit Services. The success of TheBus and its business model has been well received by residents, tourists and the transit industry. Ridership for TheBus has grown from 30 million passengers per year to approximately 71 million. TheBus is now the 20th most utilized transit system in the country, the 13th most utilized bus fleet, and the sixth highest transit ridership in the country per-capita. TheBus also has the lowest cost per passenger mile of any system and one of the lowest cost per boarding passengers in the industry.

=== Strikes and ridership ===
Despite its success, TheBus also had its share of setbacks. In August 2003, a strike by union workers left Honolulu without bus service for nearly a month. This move and its settlement the following September coincided with the City Council approving a fare increase to $2 and other increases in rates and pass fees, in part to fund the city&#x27;s promise to the Teamsters not to cut service and employees. By 2006, ridership and profits rebounded thanks to the implementation of programs geared toward college students who commute to school and work, and rising gas prices.

In 2009, ridership for TheBus dipped slightly by 2% due to its July 2009 decision to increase its fares to $2.25, lower gas prices, and a rising unemployment rate. Overall, Honolulu has had relatively high bus ridership. In 2008, 5.6 percent of Hawaiʻi commuters used public transportation, while 66.8 percent drove to work alone, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.

On September 29, 2009, Oahu Transit Services and the City &amp; County of Honolulu announced plans to build an intermodal transit center that will be located at TheBus&#x27; facilities at Middle Street. The $8.2 million project, called The Middle Street Intermodal Center, whose location will take up a large portion of the Middle Street-Kamehameha Highway intersection, was scheduled to open in October 2010, but was delayed until November 14, 2011, when the terminal opened. The newly expanded facility incorporates TheBus, TheHandi-Van, bicycles, cars, walking, and the Skyline light metro line, including a pedestrian bridge and walkway for passengers who want to make connections to the rail line&#x27;s Middle Street station from the transit center. In addition, the center will also have a 1000-car parking facility, an enclosed transit layover bay for waiting passengers, an electronic information billboard, a customer service center, two restroom buildings, a utility building, and security office.

=== Safety and service improvements ===
In May 2010, TheBus began additional changes in order to improve service system-wide. One major change included the installation of security cameras in its fleet in an effort to deter criminal activity. It also installed a GPS system known as &quot;HEA&quot; (short for &#x27;Honolulu Estimated Arrival&#x27;, while also evoking the Hawaiian word &quot;hea&quot; meaning &quot;where?&quot;) in the majority of vehicles, and set up a website at hea.thebus.org enabling passengers waiting at stops to track bus locations via cell phone.

== Routes ==

, TheBus operates service on 117 routes, including three express routes and two limited stop routes.

== Fares ==
Fares can be paid using a HOLO smart card or cash. As of July 2022, one-way adult trip costs $3, with a daily fare cap of $7.50. A one-way youth fare is $1.50, with one-way disability, senior, low income, and Medicare fares set at $1.25. Prior to July 1, 2021, paper passes were also accepted. Upon tapping a HOLO card to a reader, passengers receive an unlimited number of free transfers for 2.5 hours, including onto Skyline trains.

As of August 2023, TheBus is free to all public high school students.

== Advertising ==

Prior to the City &amp; County taking over the HRT in 1971, outdoor advertising was allowed on the exterior of the buses. However, since the transfer of ownership the advertising has been restricted to the interior of the fleet, even though there was never a restriction or ban on placing ads on the exterior of the buses, a move that the Outdoor Circle (a group that is opposed to outdoor advertising in Hawaiʻi) actively supports. On December 4, 2013, Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced a plan to place ads on the outside of the buses (but not at stops or in shelters, as these would be prohibited locations per a ban on non-moving outdoor advertising in the state) in an effort to generate money to fund more revenue, restore cut routes, prevent fare increases, and improve the system&#x27;s infrastructure. However, the associated bill was deferred, and alternative funding for TheBus was later passed by City Council. The Bill failed to pass the required three readings within two years of introduction, and was filed.

== Fleet ==

As of February 2022, there are 518 buses in the fleet, 17 of which are electric vehicles. This number decreased from fiscal year 2015–16, during which the fleet comprised 542 buses, including 115 articulated buses, 389 40-foot buses, and 39 that were less than 40 feet in length, with an average overall fleet age of 9.5 years for all buses in service at the time. The first battery-powered electric TheBus vehicle was unveiled in December 2020 after a six-week pilot period in 2018. As of 2013, 15.4% of the fleet were hybrid models.

All buses in TheBus fleet have Hawaiʻi State license plate numbers matching the assigned bus fleet number and beginning with the letters &quot;BUS&quot;, and are equipped with automatic stop annunciators. The announcement system voice is provided by songwriter, translator, and Hawaiian language scholar Puakea Nogelmeier, who in 2003 professionally recorded nearly 6,000 phrases for the system. During the recording process, Nogelmeier researched each Hawaiian place name to ensure the most accurate pronunciation, and his voice has helped to standardize how people pronounce these names. Due to the naturally deep tone of his voice, it is digitally pitched up a half-note.

=== TheHandi-Van ===
TheHandi-Van is the paratransit supplement to TheBus which provides shared-ride services to disabled passengers unable to use standard public transportation or fixed route service. Registration is required, and each ride must be reserved in advance. The fleet includes 207 vehicles which operate during the same days and hours as TheBus. TheHandi-Van serves over 3,000 daily riders (with approximately 13,000 eligible total), operates year-round and 24 hours per day, and is the most in-demand paratransit service per capita in the nation. Rides are able to be requested from any area located within of a mile of any bus route, and are available to disabled visitors along with residents.

== Reception and ridership ==
Due to its low cost and wide coverage, TheBus is a very popular means of travel by high school students. The fact that free school bus routes are not provided for the majority of Honolulu&#x27;s students, as they are in many other parts in the United States, also contributes to high usage of TheBus among high school students. Because of this popularity, and the fact it was developed during Fasi&#x27;s tenure as mayor of Honolulu, it received the nickname &quot;Uncle Fasi&#x27;s Limousine Service,&quot; also known as &quot;Uncle Fasi&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Fasi&#x27;s Limo.&quot; Students at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and community colleges who have paid semesterly fees also receive an unlimited bus pass via the college &quot;U-PASS&quot; system.

In July 2023, the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education announced the EXPRESS program, providing free public transit to all public high school students (grades 9–12) across the state – including via TheBus and Skyline on Oʻahu – beginning in the 2023–24 school year.

TheBus has been criticized by local publications such as Honolulu Civil Beat for &quot;heading in the wrong direction&quot;, citing both rising fares yet a steady decline in ridership since 2015 despite increasing traffic on the island. In July 2022, ridership numbers had only recovered to 60% of their pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. In an effort to boost ridership, a fare-free week was piloted in August of the same year, which resulted in a 12% ridership increase and an additional 20,000 rides, well surpassing predictions of a 10% increase. Another fare-free period for all transit on Oʻahu was held to coincide with the launch of Skyline rail service in July 2023.

As of December 2022, over 75% of regular TheBus riders are low-income and nearly 90% earn below Oʻahu&#x27;s average median income. Proponents of free public transport have citied these reasons, among others such as climate change, as reasons for TheBus to adopt a fare-free policy, which would mirror that of the Big Island of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Hele-On bus system.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Best Transit System&quot; ===
Since its inception, TheBus has been recognized twice by the American Public Transportation Association as &quot;America&#x27;s Best Transit System&quot; for 1994–1995 and 2000–2001.

<text>William Behnes (1795 – 3 January 1864) was a British sculptor of the early 19th century.

==Life==

Born in London, Behnes was the son of a Hanoverian piano-maker and his English wife. His brother was Henry Behnes, also a sculptor, albeit an inferior one. The family moved to Dublin and there William studied art at the Dublin Academy.

After the family returned to London, Behnes continued his artistic training, studying at the Royal Academy School of Art from 1813, under the tutorship of Peter Francis Chenu. As a painter, he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1815 and won several medals during the ensuing years. In 1819 he won a Society of Arts gold medal for inventing an instrument to assist sculpture work, having by this time begun to practice successfully as a sculptor.

In 1837 Behnes was appointed &#x27;Sculptor in Ordinary&#x27; to Queen Victoria. His pupils included noted sculptors George Frederic Watts, Thomas Woolner and Henry Weekes, and naturalist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins.

Despite huge success, being declared &quot;superior to Chantrey&quot; in bust portraiture, he could not manage his finances and was declared bankrupt in 1861. His final work, the statue of Sir Henry Havelock (1861) in Trafalgar Square, has the claim to fame of being the first known statue based purely upon a photograph of his subject.

It is likely that he was an alcoholic and also a gambler, and this was worsened by bankruptcy. He moved to &quot;miserable lodgings&quot; in Charlotte Street.

He was found lying unconscious in a gutter, with only three pence in his pocket, on New Years Day 1864 and died on 3 January in Middlesex Hospital.

He was buried in an unmarked grave in Kensal Green Cemetery. George Cruikshank, who had known him, campaigned to raise money for a monument and to present a bronze bust of Behnes to the National Gallery, but there was little progress and the campaign was abandoned.

In December 2016, a folio of 41 pages of Behnes&#x27; sketches (some double-sided) was sold at auction by Cuttlestones Auctioneers &amp; Valuers at Penkridge in Staffordshire, for £2,200. It includes sketches of the Duke of Newcastle, Sir Thomas Gresham, and Sir Robert Peel.

Behr is a graduate of the Sylvia Young Theatre School, and was discovered by Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins, who put her in his female Bros concept, Faith Hope &amp; Charity singing alongside Diana Barrand and future Xpansions member Sally Ann Marsh, signed to WEA. However the trio were not successful and Behr moved into television production.

In 1989, Behr had a brief appearance in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; and then later was a presenter on the late night Channel 4 music show, &quot;The Word&quot;, for five years. She went on to feature in over 30 TV shows, including &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, &quot;Ice Warriors&quot;; and in 2001 the co-presenting role alongside Joe Mace on the first series of the BBC&#x27;s flagship children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;. She provided the voice for the on board ship&#x27;s computer (also named Dani) in the computer game &quot;Privateer 2&quot;.

Behr starred in &quot;Goodbye Charlie Bright&quot;, a film by Nick Love. She played the character of Blondie, the love interest of Charlie.

From October 2001 until June 2007, she voiced the safety message on Virgin Atlantic. Behr also was &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s female presenter of the year in 2002.

After numerous presenting jobs for shows in the United States, Behr decided to move permanently to Hollywood to begin presenting &quot;Extra&quot; for NBC. She went on to host several more shows for Fox, NBC/Bravo, VH1, including the 2003 reality show &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot;.

After marriage and the birth of her two children, Behr attempted a UK television comeback on the 2008 edition of ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!&quot; where she was the second person to be voted out by the public, on day 12.

<text>Samuel Newhouse (October 18, 1853 – September 22, 1930) was an American entrepreneur and mining magnate.

==Life and career==
Newhouse was born in New York City to European Jewish immigrant parents, and later studied and practiced law in Pennsylvania. He moved to Colorado in 1879. In Leadville, he became involved in the freighting business.

In 1883, he married Ida Stingly, whose mother ran a local boarding house. She was 16 at the time. While they ran a hotel in Leadville, Samuel acquired mining properties in Ouray, Colorado. He later sold these for several million dollars and moved to Denver, where he became a speculator and promoter, with extensive contacts back East and in Europe.

In 1896, he moved to Utah, where partnering with Thomas Weir, he became instrumental in securing English investment in the fledgling copper mining operation in Bingham canyon, which later became the great Bingham Canyon Mine. He also developed silver mining in the San Francisco Mountains near Beaver, Utah, investing approximately $2 million to build a mine, mill and develop the town of Newhouse, named after himself. He was instrumental in driving the Newhouse Tunnel (now called the Argo Tunnel), a major mine drainage tunnel in Idaho Springs, Colorado.

He maintained residences on Long Island and in London, and a chateau in France. He preferred living in Salt Lake City, where he developed a large tract of downtown, trying to shift the center of town four blocks south from Temple Square. He built the city&#x27;s first skyscrapers (11 stories), the Boston and Newhouse buildings.

At one time he owned the lot where the future Flatiron Building in New York City would be located. However, &quot;his financial empire crashed in 1916&quot;.

<text>Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr. (born Solomon Isadore Neuhaus; May 24, 1895 – August 29, 1979) was an American broadcasting businessman, as well as a magazine and newspaper publisher. He was the founder of Advance Publications.

==Early life==
Newhouse was born Solomon Isadore Neuhaus in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the eldest of eight children born to Jewish immigrants. His father, Meier Neuhaus, was an immigrant from Vitebsk, then Russian Empire (now Belarus); and his mother, Rose (née Arenfeldt), was from Austria-Hungary. Meier Neuhaus later adapted his name to Meyer Newhouse.

Although his father had studied to become a rabbi, he was unskilled and only worked occasionally due to poor health. The family moved to Bayonne, New Jersey where his mother supported the family by peddling linens and in 1908, his father abandoned the family for health reasons to live with his sister in Connecticut. Newhouse quit school and enrolled in a six-week bookkeeping course at the Gaffrey School in Manhattan which enabled him to secure a job as an office boy working for Hyman Lazarus, a lawyer, police court judge, and politician in Bayonne. At age sixteen, he was promoted to office manager of Lazarus&#x27; law firm.

==Career==
Noting Newhouse&#x27;s work ethic and enthusiasm, Lazarus had Newhouse manage the money-losing Bayonne Times (a local newspaper in which Lazarus had acquired a majority interest, due to an unpaid legal bill), allowing Newhouse to keep half of the profits if successful. Newhouse quickly determined that the paper was not earning enough fees from advertisements, and personally solicited new advertisers while also assisting them in planning the timing of store sales. The paper returned to profitability, and he received a 20 percent ownership interest as payment (after continued success, his share increased to 50 percent). Later, he decided to attend law school in the evenings; in 1916, he graduated from the New Jersey Law School (now Rutgers School of Law–Newark). His career in the practice of law was short-lived: he was so humiliated after losing the one case he took to trial that he paid his client the full amount of the damages he had requested. Nevertheless, thanks to his support, Rutgers School of Law-Newark is presently housed in the S.I. Newhouse Center for Law and Justice.

In 1922, taking all his personal savings and partnering with Lazarus, he bought 51 percent of the Staten Island Advance for $98,000 and soon returned the paper to profitability. In 1924, Lazarus died and Newhouse purchased Lazarus&#x27;s share from his widow as well as the 49 percent that he and the judge did not own. Newhouse began to expand his empire, purchasing, merging, and returning to profitability numerous papers.

===Business strategy===
Newhouse focused on purchasing bargain-priced papers in growing communities. He had no interest in starting new papers or in unrelated ventures, even declining an offer to purchase the New York Yankees. He typically acquired a city&#x27;s oldest newspaper and then purchased the city&#x27;s second newspaper, thereby allowing him to set advertising rates. Although he generally promised to keep both papers in business and in competition, he typically merged the two, generally closing the afternoon paper and keeping the morning, effectively establishing a monopoly, then used the profits to purchase additional newspapers.

Newhouse largely ran his various interests out of a brown leather briefcase and kept key figures in his head, even as his acquisitions grew into an empire of 20 newspapers, as well as numerous magazines, radio stations and television stations. He never had what could be called a formal headquarters; for many years, Advance Publications&#x27; corporate address was the same as that of the &quot;Staten Island Advance.&quot;

===Timeline of acquisitions===
*1932: &quot;Long Island Daily Press&quot; 
*1935: &quot;Newark Ledger&quot;
*1939: &quot;Newark Star Eagle&quot; merged with &quot;Newark Ledger&quot; to form the &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot; 
*1939: &quot;Syracuse Herald&quot; and &quot;Syracuse Journal&quot; (merged) 
*1941: &quot;Syracuse Post-Standard&quot; 
*1945: &quot;Jersey Journal&quot; 
*1947: &quot;Harrisburg News&quot;, and &quot;Harrisburg Patriot&quot; (later merged into &quot;The Patriot-News&quot;).
*1949: &quot;Advance Publications Inc.&quot; formed as the primary holding company for all his newspaper assets. 
*1950: &quot;Portland Oregonian&quot; 
*1955: &quot;The Birmingham News&quot;, &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; and the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; 
*1959: &quot;Condé Nast Publications&quot; purchased for $5 million at the suggestion of his wife. According to Newhouse, &quot;She asked for a fashion magazine and I went out and got her Vogue.&quot; Condé Nast also published &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, and &quot;Young Bride&quot;. He soon purchased another magazine publisher, &quot;Street &amp; Smith&quot; and merged it with &quot;Condé Nast&quot;, becoming a major magazine publisher.
*1961: &quot;Oregon Journal&quot; 
*1962: &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; and &quot;States-Item&quot;, both in New Orleans, Louisiana (merged in 1980) 
*1967: &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; 
*1976: he purchased Booth Newspapers for $305 million, a chain of eight dailies in Michigan (Ann Arbor News, Bay City Times, Flint Journal, Grand Rapids Press, Jackson Citizen Patriot, Kalamazoo Gazette, Muskegon Chronicle, and the Saginaw News) as well as the Sunday supplement Parade.

==Personal life==
He was married to arts patron and philanthropist Mitzi Epstein (April 30, 1902 – June 29, 1989), who grew up in an upper middle class, Jewish family on the Upper West Side, the daughter of a silk tie importer. They had two sons, Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., known as Si Newhouse, chairman of &quot;Advance&quot;, and Donald Newhouse, president of Advance.

Samuel Newhouse resided in Manhattan for much of his life. In 1942, he bought Greenlands, a working farm of 143 acres in Harbourton, Mercer County, New Jersey. In his privately published memoir, &quot;A Memo to my Children&quot;, he documented his often strained relationship with his two sons. His great-grandson, S.I. Newhouse IV, is featured in a documentary called &quot;Born Rich&quot; about the experience of growing up as the heir to one of the world&#x27;s greatest fortunes.

==Death and legacy==
Newhouse died in 1979, aged 84, in New York City of a stroke. Upon his death, he passed his voting common stock in the principal family company, Advance Publications, in trust to his six grandchildren and made his two sons the sole trustees.

One of the vessels of the Staten Island Ferry is also named after him, as was the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, and the S.I. Newhouse Center for Law and Justice at Rutgers School of Law – Newark. He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1989.

<text>Wiklenman Vicente González [Wiki] (born May 17, 1974) is a former Venezuelan catcher in Major League Baseball who played for the San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners and Washington Nationals in parts of seven seasons spanning 1999–2006. Listed at 5&#x27; 11&quot; (1.80 m), 175 lb. (79 k), González batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Maracay, Aragua.

==Career==
In a seven-season career, González posted a .238 batting average with 17 home runs and 103 RBI, including 75 runs, 41 doubles, three triples, and three stolen bases in 283 games played.

His most productive season came in 2001 with San Diego, when he batted a .275/.335/.463 with eight homers and 27 RBI.

A slow runner, González holds the curious distinction of having hit into a 5-4-3 triple play in 2002 while playing for the Padres, during a game against the New York Mets just on his birthday.

In 2008 González signed with the St. George Roadrunners of the independent Golden Baseball League. Then, in February 2009 he was traded to the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League. He was released on April 2, 2009.

In between, González played winter ball with four clubs of the Venezuelan League during the 1993–2010 seasons.
