<text>Robert Eugene Byrne (April 20, 1928 – April 12, 2013) was an American chess player and chess author who held the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM). He won the U.S. Championship in 1972, and was a World Chess Championship Candidate in 1974. Byrne represented the United States nine times in Chess Olympiads from 1952 to 1976 and won seven medals. He was the chess columnist from 1972 to 2006 for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which ran his final column (a recounting of his 1952 victory over David Bronstein) on November 12, 2006. Byrne worked as a university professor for many years, before becoming a chess professional in the early 1970s.

==Early years==
Byrne was born in Brooklyn, the son of Elizabeth Eleanor (Cattalier) and Robert Byrne. He and his younger brother Donald grew up in New York City and were among the &quot;Collins Kids&quot;, promising young players who benefited from the instruction and encouragement of John W. Collins. Both ultimately became college professors and among the leading chess players in the country. They were part of a talented new generation of young American masters that also included Larry Evans, Arthur Bisguier, and George Kramer.

Robert Byrne&#x27;s first Master event was Ventnor City in 1945, where he scored a respectable 4/9 to place 8th; the winner was Weaver Adams. He tied 1st–2nd in the Premier Reserves section at the U.S. Open Chess Championship, Pittsburgh, in 1946. College studies limited his opportunities for the next several years; he represented the U.S. in a 1950 radio match against Yugoslavia. In the 1951 Maurice Wertheim Memorial in New York, Byrne scored 6/11, tying for 6th–7th place; this was a Grandmaster round-robin featuring six of the world&#x27;s top 36 players, and was won by Samuel Reshevsky.

Byrne became an International Master based on his results at the 1952 Chess Olympiad at Helsinki (bronze medal on third board). In that same year he graduated from Yale University. He went on to become a professor of philosophy at Indiana University, and his academic career left him little time for chess. He did represent the U.S. in team matches against the Soviet Union at New York in 1954 (losing 1½–2½ to Alexander Kotov), and Moscow in 1955 (losing ½–3½ to Paul Keres).

==Grandmaster==

Byrne shared 4th–7th positions at the 1957 U.S. Open Chess Championship in Cleveland with 9/12, a point behind joint winners Bobby Fischer and Arthur Bisguier. Byrne did not play in his first U.S. Chess Championship until the age of 30 in 1958–59, placing tied 9th–10th with 4/11; the winner was Bobby Fischer. But Byrne improved dramatically the next year in the same event to place 2nd with 8/11, ahead of Reshevsky and Pal Benko, as Fischer won again.

In 1960, Byrne increased his serious play, winning the U.S. Open Chess Championship at St. Louis, and taking a silver medal on third board at the Olympiad in Leipzig. A poor result of 8th–11th place in the U.S. Championship 1960–61, with only 4½/11, was balanced by his fine tie for 2nd–5th places at Mar del Plata 1961 with 11½/15, behind winner Miguel Najdorf. On that same South American trip, he dominated a small but strong event at Santa Fe with 6½/7, ahead of Miroslav Filip, Aleksandar Matanović, and Héctor Rossetto. In the U.S. Championship of 1961–62, he tied for 2nd–3rd places on 7/11, half a point behind Larry Evans. He placed 6th in the U.S. Championship 1962–63 with 6/11, as Fischer won again. In the U.S. Championship 1963–64 he again placed 6th with 5½/11, as Fischer defeated Byrne brilliantly in 21 moves and won the tournament with a perfect score. Of his game against Fischer, Byrne wrote: &quot;The culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a won game!&quot;

In 1964, Byrne&#x27;s third-place finish at the Buenos Aires tournament (behind Paul Keres and World Champion Tigran Petrosian), with 11½/17, made him an International Grandmaster. Byrne shared 2nd–3rd places in the U.S. Championship 1965–66 with 7½/11; Fischer won again, but Byrne defeated Fischer in their individual game. He shared the 1966 U.S. Open title with Pal Benko at Seattle. He scored 4½/11 for a shared 8th–10th place in the U.S. Championship 1966–67, with Fischer winning. Byrne qualified for his first Interzonal tournament, Sousse 1967, but scored just 7½/22, far short of advancing.

==U.S. Champion, Candidate==
By the late 1960s he was playing chess semi-professionally. He won the 1972 U.S. Championship; after tying with Samuel Reshevsky and Lubomir Kavalek in the tournament proper, Byrne won the 1973 playoff at Chicago. Subsequently, scoring 12½/17, Byrne achieved his career highlight of third place at the Leningrad Interzonal in 1973, which made him only the fourth American (after Reshevsky, Bobby Fischer, and Pal Benko) to qualify for the Candidates Tournament (part of the world chess championship process). However, he lost his first-round Candidates match to former world champion Boris Spassky by 1½–4½ at San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1974.

As a 1974 Candidate, Byrne was seeded directly to the 1976 Biel Interzonal, where he performed very strongly but missed a playoff berth by half a point, sharing 5th–6th places with 11½/19, behind Bent Larsen (winner, with 12½), Mikhail Tal, Lajos Portisch, and Petrosian (2th–4th, with 12).

==At the Olympiads==
Byrne played nine times for the United States, with a total of +51−12=53, for 66.8 per cent, and won seven individual and team medals. His detailed results follow.

* Helsinki 1952, board 3, 10½/15 (+8−2=5), board bronze;
* Leipzig 1960, board 3, 12/15 (+9−0=6), board silver, team silver;
* Varna 1962, board 4, 8½/13 (+7−3=3);
* Havana 1966, board 2, 6½/13 (+3−3=7), team silver;
* Lugano 1968, board 4, 7½/12 (+4−1=7);
* Skopje 1972, board 2, 9½/14 (+6−1=7);
* Nice 1974, board 2, 12/16 (+8−0=8), team bronze;
* Haifa 1976, board 1, 7/10 (+5−1=4), team gold;
* Buenos Aires 1978, board 4, 4/8 (+1−1=6), team bronze.

==Later career and legacy==

When he became the columnist for the &quot;Times&quot; in 1972, he became less active as a player. He did, nevertheless, win tournaments at Torremolinos (1976–77), Harare (1983), and Lagos (1993). He has also been a frequent contributor to &quot;Chess Life&quot; magazine, the publication of the United States Chess Federation. He has chaired USCF&#x27;s committee on masters&#x27; affairs and been one of its vice presidents. Byrne was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1994.

Throughout his career, Byrne improved his results level by level in major competitions, at the U.S. Open, the U.S. Championship, the Olympiad, and the Interzonal. He made original contributions in several opening systems. He was the first to play 6.Be3 against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Be3); this system has been named for him and has been very popular since the mid-1980s. He developed the Byrne Variation of the King&#x27;s Indian Defense against the Saemisch Variation, with a quick queenside expansion by Black. He used the Dutch Defense with success when that opening was rarely seen at the top level. His opening repertoire was wide with both colors, and featured both Open and Closed games, which made him a challenge to prepare for. Byrne played competitively until age 74 in 2002, with an average of a couple of significant events per year even past age 60. He retired from writing his chess column at age 78.

==Death==
Byrne died in 2013 at his home in Ossining, New York, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

* Robert Byrne vs Viktor Korchnoi, Moscow 1975, Pirc Defense, Austrian Attack (B09), 1–0 Korchnoi&#x27;s form during this period took him to two world championship challenges in the years ahead.
* Robert Byrne vs Vasily Smyslov, Biel Interzonal 1976, French Defense, Winawer / Positional Variation (C19), 1–0 Byrne succeeds with a line which Smyslov himself had made famous in the 1940s.
* Robert Byrne vs Joel Benjamin, U.S. Championship, Berkeley 1984, Sicilian Defense, Classical Richter–Rauzer Variation (B60), 1–0 Benjamin neglects his development and King safety, and pays the ultimate price.

<doc id="768788" wikidata="Q1416653" url="?curid=768788" title="Newspaper of record">
<text>A newspaper of record is a major national newspaper with large circulation whose editorial and news-gathering functions are considered authoritative and independent; they are thus &quot;newspapers of record by reputation&quot; and include some of the oldest and most widely respected newspapers in the world. The number and trend of &quot;newspapers of record by reputation&quot; is related to the state of press freedom and political freedom in a country.

It may also be a newspaper authorized to publish public or legal notices, thus serving as a newspaper of public record. A newspaper whose editorial content is directed by the state can be referred to as an official newspaper of record, but the lack of editorial independence means that it is not a &quot;newspaper of record by reputation&quot;. Newspapers of record by reputation that focus on business can also be called newspapers of financial record.

==Newspapers of &quot;public&quot; record==

A &quot;newspaper of public record&quot;, or government gazette, refers to a publicly available newspaper that is authorized by a government to publish public or legal notices. It is often established by statute or official action and publication of notices within it, whether by the government or a private party, is considered sufficient to comply with legal requirements for public notice. Such gazettes may have minimal or no editorial content (opinion articles), and are focused on public notification of state services and state decisions; an example is Latvia&#x27;s &quot;Latvijas Vēstnesis&quot;.

In some jurisdictions, privately owned newspapers may register with the government to publish public and legal notices, or be otherwise eligible to publish such notices (terms used may include &quot;newspaper of general circulation&quot; among others). Likewise, a private newspaper may be designated by the courts for publication of legal notices, such as notices of fictitious business names, if judicial and statutory standards are met. These are sometimes called &quot;legally adjudicated newspapers&quot;.

===Government organs===
The term &quot;newspapers of public record&quot; can also denote those owned and operated by a government that directs their entire editorial content. Such newspapers, while pejoratively termed &quot;state mouthpieces&quot;, can also be called &quot;official newspapers of record&quot;, independently of whether they publish legal notices - distinguishing them from a gazette whose primary role is to publish notices, as their entire content represents the official view and doctrine of the state. This kind of official newspaper is distinct from newspapers of record by reputation, and is liable to fail the reputation criterion due to its governmental control. The word &quot;official&quot; can be used to distinguish them from &quot;newspapers of record by reputation&quot;. Examples include Russia&#x27;s &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot;, North Korea&#x27;s &quot;Rodong Sinmun&quot;, and China&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;.

==Newspapers of record &quot;by reputation&quot;==
The second type of &quot;newspaper of record&quot; (also &quot;journal of record&quot;, or in French &quot;&quot;) is not defined by formal criteria, and its characteristics vary. The category comprises newspapers that are considered to meet high standards of journalism, including editorial independence (particularly from the government and from its owners), accountability (mistakes are acknowledged), attention to detail and accuracy, and comprehensiveness and balance of coverage; they are regarded internationally (as well as in their own country/region) by major global outlets.

Despite changes in society, newspapers of record by reputation have historically tended to maintain a similar tone, coverage, style, and traditions; many are over a century old and some over two centuries old (e.g., &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, , and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;). Newspapers of record by reputation can be respected for the accuracy and quality of their reporting and still be either ideologically conservative (e.g., &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;) or ideologically liberal (e.g., &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;).

Although many countries are proud of their newspapers of record by reputation, in some countries they face an openly hostile state or political system that tries to suppress their press freedoms. Examples are Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot;, where many of the staff have been imprisoned; Panama&#x27;s &quot;La Prensa&quot;, where staff have been shot and the owners forced into exile; and Venezuela&#x27;s &quot;El Nacional&quot;, which was forced out of print when the state seized its assets (see examples of fallen newspapers of record).

===Etymology===
The term is believed to have originated among librarians who began referring to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;newspaper of record&quot; when it became the first U.S. newspaper in 1913 to publish an index of the subjects it covered. In recognition of that usage, &quot;The New York Times&quot; held an essay contest in 1927 in which entrants had to demonstrate &quot;The Value of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Index and Files as a Newspaper of Record&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and other newspapers of its type sought to chronicle events, acting as a record of the day&#x27;s announcements, schedules, directories, proceedings, transcripts, and appointments. By 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; no longer considered itself a newspaper of record in the original, literal sense.

Over time, historians relied on &quot;The New York Times&quot; and similar titles as a reliable archival and historical record of significant past events, and a gauge of societal opinions at the time of printing. The term &quot;newspaper of record&quot; evolved from its original literal sense to that newer meaning.

The derived term &quot;financial (or business) newspaper of record&quot; is attributed to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and to the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei)&quot;. While newspapers of record by reputation are typically major widely-read national (and international) publications, subject-specific newspapers of record also exist (see examples of subject-specific newspapers of record).

Over time, some established newspapers of record by reputation have lost their status due to financial collapse, take-over or merger by another entity that did not have the same standards or allowed increased government control and suppression of the paper&#x27;s editorial independence. The existence of newspapers of record by reputation is an aspect of the level of press freedom and political freedom in a country, with major first-world democracies having several such newspapers (e.g. United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan); in contrast, countries that have seen a decline in their newspapers of record by reputation can represent a decline in levels of personal and political freedom (e.g. Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Cambodia).

Examples include:
*Zimbabwe&#x27;s &quot;The Herald&quot;, lost its status as an established newspaper of record when it was eventually taken over by Robert Mugabe&#x27;s Zanu-PF party.
* Venezuela&#x27;s newspaper of record, &quot;El Nacional&quot;, was forced out of print by the state in 2018, and its headquarters was given to a high-ranking official.
* London-based pan-Arab newspaper of record, &quot;Al-Hayat&quot;, ceased in 2020 due to financial and political pressures.
* In Cambodia, the Hun Sen administration forced both of Cambodia&#x27;s newspapers of record out of business using contrived tax fines that resulted in the closure of &quot;The Cambodia Daily&quot; in 2017, and the sale of &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; to a close ally of the Hun Sen administration in 2018.
* Latvian newspaper &quot;Diena&quot; saw its established status as a newspaper of record diminish after a 2010 takeover, with the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Latvia&quot; (2017) listing it as &quot;holding tenuously to a popular newspaper-of-record sentiment at home and abroad&quot; due to &quot;questions of ownership and if said owners influence newspaper content&quot;.
* &quot;Népszabadság&quot;, Hungary&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; newspaper of record, ceased publication in 2016 due to political and financial pressure.

<text>Escalade is the act of defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders. Escalade was a prominent feature of sieges in ancient and medieval warfare. Although no longer common in modern warfare, escalade technologies are still developed and used in certain tactical applications.

== Overview ==
Escalade consists of attacking soldiers advancing to the base of a wall, setting ladders, and climbing to engage the defending forces. Though very simple and direct, it was also one of the most dangerous options available; escalade would generally be conducted in the face of arrow fire from the battlements, and the defenders would naturally attempt to push ladders away from the wall. Heated or incendiary substances such as boiling water, heated sand, and pitch-coated missiles were sometimes poured on attacking soldiers. This made it difficult for attackers to reach the top of the wall, and those that did would often quickly be overwhelmed by the defenders on the walls, only being able to push into the defenses after suffering heavy attrition.

Fortifications were often constructed in such a way as to impede escalade, or at least to make it a less attractive option. Countermeasures to escalade included moats (which prevented ladder-bearing soldiers from reaching the base of a wall), machicolations (which facilitated attacks on enemy soldiers while they climbed), and talus walls (which could weaken ladders or were too tall for ladders to reach the top of).
Because of the difficulties involved, escalade was typically very costly for the attackers. Two critical factors in determining the success or failure of escalade were the number of ladders and the speed with which they could be arranged. A slow attack gave the defenders too much time to pick off the attackers with arrows, while having too few ladders meant that the number of troops would be insufficient to capture the battlements. A third important factor was the estimation of the height of the wall. If the ladders were made too long, they could be pushed over by the defenders, and if they were too short, the attackers would not be able to reach the top of the wall. Tactics employed included getting as many men as possible on the ladder at the same time (the more men that were on the ladder at the same time, the heavier it became, making pushing it over difficult), attacking by night, or scaling a remote section of the wall.

Escalade was, in essence, an attempt to overwhelm defenders in a direct assault rather than sit through a protracted siege. Attackers would generally attempt escalade if they had reasons for wanting a swift conclusion, or if they had an overwhelming superiority in numbers. Otherwise, less costly siege tactics were often preferred.

== Modern warfare ==

Escalade is no longer common in modern warfare, as new technologies and tactics have essentially made escalade obsolete; for example, most fortified walls that would have required attackers to use escalade may now simply be destroyed by explosives or nullified by military aircraft.

However, escalade still exists as a viable (albeit niche) combat tactic, and is occasionally used by police tactical, counterterrorist, and special forces units to raid a structure through its upper levels, either to avoid a barricaded entrance or line of sight, or to breach the structure from multiple points. Mechanical assault ladders, typically installed on the roof of vehicles and featuring ramps that can extend or angle themselves to reach an entry point such as a window sill or balcony, are often used in this capacity.

<doc id="768799" wikidata="Q1066228" url="?curid=768799" title="White-box testing">
<text>White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system is used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).
White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Where white-box testing is design-driven, that is, driven &quot;exclusively&quot; by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes), white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.

White-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:
* Control flow testing
* Data flow testing
* Branch testing
* Statement coverage
* Decision coverage
* Modified condition/decision coverage
* Prime path testing
* Path testing

== Overview ==
White-box testing is a method of testing the application at the level of the source code. These test cases are derived through the use of the design techniques mentioned above: control flow testing, data flow testing, branch testing, path testing, statement coverage and decision coverage as well as modified condition/decision coverage. White-box testing is the use of these techniques as guidelines to create an error-free environment by examining all code. These white-box testing techniques are the building blocks of white-box testing, whose essence is the careful testing of the application at the source code level to reduce hidden errors later on. These different techniques exercise every visible path of the source code to minimize errors and create an error-free environment. The whole point of white-box testing is the ability to know which line of the code is being executed and being able to identify what the correct output should be.

== Levels ==
#Unit testing. White-box testing is done during unit testing to ensure that the code is working as intended, before integration happens with previously tested code. White-box testing during unit testing potentially catches many defects early on and aids in addressing defects that happen later on after the code is integrated with the rest of the application and therefore reduces the impacts of errors later in development.
#Integration testing. White-box testing at this level is written to test the interactions of interfaces with each other. The unit level testing made sure that each code was tested and working accordingly in an isolated environment and integration examines the correctness of the behaviour in an open environment through the use of white-box testing for any interactions of interfaces that are known to the programmer.
#Regression testing. White-box testing during regression testing is the use of recycled white-box test cases at the unit and integration testing levels.

== Basic procedure ==
White-box testing&#x27;s basic procedures require the tester to have an in-depth knowledge of the source code being tested. The programmer must have a deep understanding of the application to know what kinds of test cases to create so that every visible path is exercised for testing. Once the source code is understood then it can be analyzed for test cases to be created. The following are the three basic steps that white-box testing takes in order to create test cases:

# Input involves different types of requirements, functional specifications, detailed designing of documents, proper source code and security specifications. This is the preparation stage of white-box testing to lay out all of the basic information.
# Processing involves performing risk analysis to guide whole testing process, proper test plan, execute test cases and communicate results. This is the phase of building test cases to make sure they thoroughly test the application the given results are recorded accordingly.
# Output involves preparing final report that encompasses all of the above preparations and results.

== Advantages ==
# Side effects of having the knowledge of the source code is beneficial to thorough testing.
#Optimization of code becomes easy as inconspicuous bottlenecks are exposed.
#Gives the programmer introspection because developers carefully describe any new implementation.
#Provides traceability of tests from the source, thereby allowing future changes to the source to be easily captured in the newly added or modified tests.
#Easy to automate.
#Provides clear, engineering-based rules for when to stop testing.

== Disadvantages ==

#White-box tests are written to test the details of a specific implementation. This means that the tests will fail when the implementation changes as the test is tightly coupled to the implementation. Additional work has to be done to update the tests so they match the implementation again when it is changed. On the other hand with black-box testing, tests are independent of the implementation, and so they will still run successfully if the implementation changes but the output or side-effects of the implementation do not.
#The code under test could be rewritten to implement the same functionality in a different way that invalidates the assumptions baked into the test. This could result in tests that fail unnecessarily or, in the worst case, tests that now give false positives and mask errors in the code. The white-box test never was written such that it tests the intended behavior of the code under test, but instead only such that the specific implementation does what it does.
#White-box testing brings complexity to testing because the tester must have knowledge of the program, or the test team needs to have at least one very good programmer who can understand the program at the code level. White-box testing requires a programmer with a high level of knowledge due to the complexity of the level of testing that needs to be done.
#On some occasions, it is not realistic to be able to test every single existing condition of the application and some conditions will be untested.
#The tests focus on the software as it exists, and missing functionality may not be discovered.

== Modern view ==
A more modern view is that the dichotomy between white-box testing and black-box testing has blurred and is becoming less relevant. Whereas &quot;white-box&quot; originally meant using the source code, and black-box meant using requirements, tests are now derived from many documents at various levels of abstraction. The real point is that tests are usually designed from an abstract structure such as the input space, a graph, or logical predicates, and the question is what level of abstraction we derive that abstract structure from. That can be the source code, requirements, input space descriptions, or one of dozens of types of design models. Therefore, the &quot;white-box / black-box&quot; distinction is less important and the terms are less relevant.

== Hacking ==
In penetration testing, white-box testing refers to a method where a white hat hacker has full knowledge of the system being attacked. The goal of a white-box penetration test is to simulate a malicious insider who has knowledge of and possibly basic credentials for the target system. For such a penetration test, administrative credentials are typically provided in order to analyse how or which attacks can impact high-privileged accounts. Source code can be made available to be used as a reference for the tester. When the code is a target of its own, this is not (only) a penetration test but a source code security audit (or security review).

<doc id="768801" wikidata="Q7547078" url="?curid=768801" title="Snake River Land Company">
<text>The Snake River Land Company or the Snake River Cattle and Stock Company was a land purchasing company established in 1927 by philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. The company acted as a front so Rockefeller could buy land in the Jackson Hole valley in Wyoming without people knowing of his involvement or his intentions for the property, and have the land held until the National Park Service could administer it.

The company launched a campaign to purchase more than 35,000 acres (142 km²) for $1.4 million but faced 15 years of opposition by ranchers and a refusal by the Park Service to take the land. Allegations that the company conspired with the Park Service by using illegal land purchasing tactics led to United States Senate subcommittee meetings in 1933 during which the company and the service were exonerated. Hard times during the Great Depression alleviated opposition by ranchers to sell.

Discouraged by the stalemate, Rockefeller sent a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt telling him that if the federal government did not accept the land that &quot;it will be my thought to make some other disposition of it or to sell it in the market to any satisfactory buyers&quot;. Soon afterward on March 15, 1943, the president declared 221,000 acres (894 km²) of land as Jackson Hole National Monument. The land, however, did not enter federal stewardship until December 16, 1949 when it was added to the monument. The next year, the monument was merged into the expanded Grand Teton National Park.

<doc id="768802" wikidata="Q1356782" url="?curid=768802" title="James Whitbread Lee Glaisher">
<text>James Whitbread Lee Glaisher (5 November 1848, in Lewisham — 7 December 1928, in Cambridge) was a prominent English mathematician and astronomer. He is known for Glaisher&#x27;s theorem, an important result in the field of integer partitions, and 
for the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant, a number important in both mathematics and physics. 

He was a passionate collector of English ceramics and valentines, much of which he bequeathed to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

==Life==

He was born in Lewisham in Kent on 5 November 1848 the son of the eminent astronomer James Glaisher and his wife, Cecilia Louisa Belville. His mother was a noted photographer.

He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School from 1858. He became somewhat of a school celebrity in 1861 when he made two hot-air balloon ascents with his father to study the stratosphere.

He won a Campden Exhibition Scholarship allowing him to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was second wrangler in 1871 and was made a Fellow of the college. Influential in his time on teaching at the University of Cambridge, he is now remembered mostly for work in number theory that anticipated later interest in the detailed properties of modular forms. He published widely over other fields of mathematics.

Glaisher was elected FRS in 1875. He was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Messenger of Mathematics&quot;. He was also the &#x27;tutor&#x27; of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (tutor being a non-academic role in Cambridge University). He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society 1886–1888 and 1901–1903. When George Biddell Airy retired as Astronomer Royal in 1881 it is said that Glaisher was offered the post but declined.

He lived in a set of rooms at Trinity College. He died there on 7 December 1928.

He was a keen cyclist but preferred his penny-farthing to the newer &quot;safety&quot; bicycles. He was President of Cambridge University Cycling Club 1882 to 1885. He was a keen collector of English Delftware and other popular English pottery, much of it then below the notice of other collectors. The university indulged him by allowing him a room of the Fitzwilliam Museum to house his personal collection. He also amassed a collection of some 1,600 valentines, which he bequeathed to the museum.

==Awards==
*Honorary doctorate (DSc) from the University of Dublin in 1892
*Honorary doctorate (DSc) from Manchester University in 1902
*Winner of the London Mathematical Society&#x27;s De Morgan Medal in 1908
*Winner of the Royal Society&#x27;s Sylvester Medal in 1913
*Fellow of the Royal Society in 1875 at the young age of 27

==Publications==
Glaisher published over 400 articles on various topics, including astronomy, special functions, and number theory, and was editor and contributor to both the &quot;Messenger of Mathematics&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Mathematics&quot;.

<doc id="768808" wikidata="Q1332274" url="?curid=768808" title="The Frighteners">
<text>The Frighteners is a 1996 supernatural comedy horror film directed by Peter Jackson and co-written with Fran Walsh. The film stars Michael J. Fox, Trini Alvarado, Peter Dobson, John Astin, Dee Wallace Stone, Jeffrey Combs, R. Lee Ermey and Jake Busey. &quot;The Frighteners&quot; tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts after his wife&#x27;s murder. He initially uses his new abilities to befriend ghosts, whom he sends to haunt people so that he can charge them handsome fees for &quot;exorcising&quot; the ghosts. However, the spirit of a mass murderer appears posing as the Grim Reaper, able to attack the living and the dead, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence.

Jackson and Walsh conceived the idea for &quot;The Frighteners&quot; during the script-writing phase of &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;. Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing &quot;The Frighteners&quot; as a spin-off film of the television series, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. With Jackson and Walsh&#x27;s first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Studios. The visual effects were created by Jackson&#x27;s Weta Digital, which had only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that &quot;The Frighteners&quot; required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.

Despite a rushed post-production schedule, Universal was so impressed with Jackson&#x27;s rough cut on &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, the studio moved the theatrical release date up by three months. The film was not a box office success, but received generally positive reviews from critics. The film gained a cult following and is considered an overlooked work in Jackson&#x27;s catalog.

==Plot==

In 1964, in the town of Fairwater, Johnny Bartlett is executed for killing 12 people at a sanatorium, driven by his ambition to become the most prolific serial killer. His teenage lover, Patricia Ann Bradley, is treated as an accomplice and sentenced to prison. Many years later, she is released into her mother&#x27;s care.

In 1990, architect Frank Bannister is a selfish husband to his wife, Debra. During an argument, a drunk Frank crashes his car, and police later find Debra dead nearby with &quot;13&quot; carved into her forehead. Frank has no memory of the event, but the trauma grants him the ability to see the spirit world. In the present, Frank lives in the unfinished remnants of the house he was building for Debra. Wracked with guilt over her death, he has become a cynical con man, using his abilities to &quot;exorcise&quot; hauntings staged by ghosts in his employ: street gangster Cyrus, nerdy Stuart, and The Judge, an Old West gunslinger.

While exorcising the home of physician Lucy Lynskey and her self-absorbed husband Ray, Frank notices the number &quot;37&quot; glowing on Ray&#x27;s forehead. Ray later dies of a heart attack. As Frank helps Lucy communicate with Ray&#x27;s ghost, he witnesses a Grim Reaper-like entity crush the heart of a man marked &quot;38&quot;. Panicked, Frank flees and follows a heavenly light to the museum, where he discovers the number 39 victim. Frank fails to save the number 40 victim, newspaper editor Magda Rees-Jones—who accused him of Debra&#x27;s murder—and the Reaper also kills The Judge. 

Realizing that the murders implicate him, Frank turns himself into the police. He is interrogated by Milton Dammers, an eccentric and unstable FBI agent traumatized by years of torture and sexual abuse while working undercover with Satanic cults. Dammers is convinced that Frank killed Debra and is psychically inflicting the unexplained heart attack deaths in the town. Lucy visits Frank in jail and they bond over their shared losses. The Reaper attacks Lucy, the number 41 victim, and Cyrus and Stuart are killed defending her and Frank during their escape. Aware he cannot protect her from the Reaper as a human, Frank has Lucy induce a near-death experience by slowing his heart with drugs and placing him in a freezer. Dammers captures Lucy and leaves Frank to die permanently, but Frank&#x27;s spirit rescues her and damages the pursuing Reaper&#x27;s disguise, revealing him to be the spirit of Bartlett.

While Frank recovers following his revival, Lucy warns her patient, Patricia, of Bartlett&#x27;s return. Patricia reveals she is still in love with Bartlett and summoned him from Hell to continue their murder spree. She kills her mother, while Frank and Lucy trap Bartlett in his urn and flee to the abandoned sanitorium, intending to use its chapel to banish him back to Hell. While Patricia and Dammers separately pursue the pair through the sanitorium, Frank experiences visions of the 1964 massacre, showing Patricia was actively involved in the murders. This helps Frank recall that Bartlett&#x27;s ghost killed Debra, and Patricia carved the number into her forehead. Dammers unwittingly releases Bartlett from the urn before being killed by Patricia.

Patricia fatally strangles Frank, but, as a spirit, he pulls her soul from her body and drags her to heaven, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Although Bartlett frees Patricia and attempts to return to Earth, they are consumed by a demonic creature and taken to Hell. In Heaven, Frank is reunited with Cyrus, Stuart, and Debra, who sends him back to Earth, telling him to be happy.

Sometime later, Frank demolishes the unfinished house and starts a relationship with Lucy, who can now see ghosts.

==Cast==

* Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister, a former architect turned ghost hunter after the trauma of his wife dying. Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned &quot;The Frighteners&quot; as a low-budget film with unknown actors, Zemeckis suggested casting his &quot;Back to the Future&quot; star Fox in the lead role. Fox became enthusiastic about working with Jackson when he saw &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival.
* Trini Alvarado as Lucy Lynskey, a physician that Frank meets. The character is named after &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; star Melanie Lynskey (who also cameos in &quot;The Frighteners&quot;).
* Peter Dobson as Ray Lynskey, Lucy&#x27;s health-obsessed and comically hot-headed husband who dislikes Frank&#x27;s tactics
* John Astin as The Judge, a decaying gunslinger ghost from the Old West with a penchant for mummies and firing guns at random. 
* Jeffrey Combs as Milton Dammers, an eccentric FBI agent who has a vendetta against Bannister. A former undercover agent known for his work with cultists, which caused him to sustain multiple massive mutilations and drove him to the brink of insanity, he has a problem with women screaming at him. Jackson opted to cast Combs as Dammers because he was a fan of the actor&#x27;s work in &quot;Re-Animator&quot;.
* Dee Wallace Stone as Patricia Bradley, inspired by Caril Ann Fugate. Bartlett&#x27;s mentally ill lover (escaping execution at the time of the original murders as she was underage) who is under strict observation by her mother.
* Jake Busey as Johnny Bartlett, a mass murderer inspired by Charles Starkweather sharing the last name of his second and third victims, girlfriend and accomplice Caril Ann Fugate&#x27;s mother and step-father Velda and Marion Bartlett. He continues his work in the afterlife, focusing on increasing his body count as a form of competition with other famous murderers. He returns from Hell, able to attack the living and the dead posing as the Grim Reaper.
* Chi McBride as Cyrus. One of Frank&#x27;s deceased associates for his ghost-hunting business.
* Jim Fyfe as Stuart, a nerd who is one of Frank&#x27;s deceased associates for his ghost-hunting business.
* Troy Evans as Sheriff Walt Perry, a local law enforcement officer and ally to Frank.
* Julianna McCarthy as Old Lady Bradley, Patricia&#x27;s mother and former director of the psychiatric hospital, who is constantly monitoring her daughter.
* R. Lee Ermey as Hiles, the ghost of a Master Sergeant. Ermey&#x27;s performance in this film is heavily reminiscent of his performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in the 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, sharing many mannerisms with the aforementioned character.
* Elizabeth Hawthorne as Magda Rees-Jones, the snooty British editor of the local newspaper.

In addition, Peter Jackson cameos as a man with piercings, his son Billy is a baby in a bouncer, Melanie Lynskey cameos as the deputy who is briefly seen standing next to Lucy Lynskey, Byron McCrawerly plays Victim #38 and Angela Bloomfield plays Frank&#x27;s deceased wife, Debra.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Peter Jackson and co-writer Fran Walsh conceived the idea for &quot;The Frighteners&quot; in 1992, during the script-writing phase of &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing &quot;The Frighteners&quot; as a spin-off film of the television series, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for &quot;The Frighteners&quot; in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided &quot;The Frighteners&quot; would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal green-lighted the film to commence pre-production on a $26 million budget in April 1994. The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.

=== Filming ===
Jackson decided to film &quot;The Frighteners&quot; entirely in New Zealand. Zemeckis and Universal agreed on the condition that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the Midwestern United States. Principal photography began on May 14, 1995, and lasted until November 16, which is one of the longest shooting schedules ever approved by Universal Pictures. Six weeks into the shoot, cinematographer Alun Bollinger had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of the shoot. Location shooting primarily included Wellington and three weeks spent in Lyttelton. Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in Miramar.

===Visual effects===
Weta Digital created the visual effects and animation, which included CGI, as well as scale models (which were necessary to make Lyttelton look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on &quot;The Frighteners&quot; was complex due to Weta&#x27;s inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company that had been in existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing &quot;The Frighteners&quot; was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin&#x27;s five hours of makeup due to his commitment on &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; trilogy, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;) fulfilled Baker&#x27;s duties.

The extended shooting schedule owed much to the fact that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air. The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper, which went through many transformations before finding physical form. &quot;We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod puppet, maybe shooting it in a water tank,&quot; Jackson commented. &quot;We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds.&quot; Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using computer animation would be the easiest task. Another character called &quot;the Gatekeeper&quot;, a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the final cut.

With digital effects work running behind schedule, Zemeckis convinced Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) to help work on &quot;The Frighteners&quot;. &quot;The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable,&quot; Takahashi reflected, &quot;but there were still about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried.&quot; Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, trying to work out whether &quot;The Frighteners&quot; could be finished in time. &quot;There was no way we&#x27;d make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money.&quot; The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US).

==Soundtrack==

The film score was written and composed by Danny Elfman. It was released in 1996 on cassette and compact disc by MCA Records and Universal Records. The closing credits play a cover of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; performed by New Zealand alternative rock band The Mutton Birds. The Mutton Birds version of the song had been previously released as a B-side to their single &quot;She&#x27;s Been Talking&quot; released in 1996. The credits also feature &quot;Superstar&quot;, written by Bonnie Bramlett + Leon Russell and performed by Sonic Youth.

==Release==
The intended release date was October 1996, but after Universal studio executives viewed a rough cut of &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, they were impressed enough to move the release date to their &quot;summer blockbuster slot&quot; on July 19, 1996. In addition, Universal offered the filmmaker the opportunity to make &quot;King Kong&quot;, which was not released until 2005. Jackson often disputed the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)&#x27;s decision on the film&#x27;s rating. Aware that he was meant to be delivering Universal a PG-13 rated film, Jackson tried his best to omit graphic violence as much as possible, but the MPAA still believed &quot;The Frighteners&quot; deserved an R rating.

===Box office===
&quot;The Frighteners&quot; was released in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. &quot;The Frighteners&quot; ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from &quot;Independence Day&quot;; in interviews conducted years after &quot;The Frighteners&quot;″ release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal&#x27;s ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which &quot;didn&#x27;t tell you anything about the picture&quot;, which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened on the same day the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered &quot;&#x27;We don&#x27;t think so; our research indicates that&#x27;s not the case...&#x27; And I just thought how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!&quot; Jackson acknowledged &quot;The Frighteners&quot;″ tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.

===Critical reception===

, 67% of the 42 reviewers selected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;The Frighteners&quot; a positive review, and the average score is 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Boasting top-notch special effects and exuberant direction from Peter Jackson, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; is visually striking but tonally uneven.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated &quot;Director Peter Jackson, at home with all kinds of excess in New Zealand, keeps everything spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing.&quot; Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoyed &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, but &quot;walked out the theater with mixed emotions,&quot; she commented that &quot;Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave &quot;The Frighteners&quot; looking more like a more frantic &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; if Jackson&#x27;s film weren&#x27;t so wearyingly overcrowded. &quot;The Frighteners&quot; is not immune to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead.&quot; Jeff Vice of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also &quot;bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt&quot;, and that if &quot;Jackson had used the restraint he showed in &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, the movie could have &quot;been the best of its kind&quot;. Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film would not make Jackson&#x27;s top five of movies, it &quot;is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you&#x27;ll enjoy casually watching from time to time&quot;. &quot;The Frighteners&quot; received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson&#x27;s native country, New Zealand.

Conversely, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; thought that the film should have remained an episode of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. Critic James Berardinelli believed that although &quot;The Frighteners&quot; wasn&#x27;t &quot;a bad film&quot;, it was &quot;a disappointment, following Jackson&#x27;s powerful, true-life matricide tale, &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, and because of that &quot;The Frighteners&quot; fell short of expectations by being just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies.&quot; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four, and felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a &quot;two thumbs down&quot; rating on their TV show &quot;At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siskel/Ebert&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film&#x27;s special effects as &quot;ugly, aggressive&quot; and &quot;proliferating&quot;, saying that &quot;trying to keep interested in [the special effects] was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [his] ear&quot;. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman&#x27;s music score&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Joey O&#x27;Brien, said that although the screenplay was &quot;practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations&quot;, it &quot;switched gears&quot; too fast and too frequently that &quot;the audience is left struggling to catch up as [&quot;The Frighteners&quot;] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale&quot;.

===Accolades===
At the 23rd Saturn Awards, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films honored Jackson with nominations for Best Director and Best Writing, the latter he shared with wife Fran Walsh. &quot;The Frighteners&quot; also was nominated for Best Horror Film, and for its Special Effects, Make-up (Rick Baker) and Music (Danny Elfman). Michael J. Fox and Jeffrey Combs were also nominated for their work.

==Home media==
&quot;The Frighteners&quot; was released on Laserdisc in 1996 in a standard release with Dolby surround on both Digital and Analog channels.

In 1998 Universal Home Video as part of the Signature Series collection released a special edition.
This includes the first release of the 14-minute longer &quot;Directors Cut,&quot; plus the following extras:
* Feature commentary by director Peter Jackson
* 4-hour documentary &quot;The Making Of The Frighteners&quot;, directed by Peter Jackson, and featuring cast interviews, rehearsals, storyboards, miniatures, and special effects
* Deleted scenes
* Theatrical trailer

The later DVD was a re-release of this with inferior audio.

&quot;The Frighteners&quot; was first released on DVD in August 1998, but included no special features.

To coincide with the release of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;, Universal Studios Home Entertainment issued a double-sided director&#x27;s cut DVD of the film in November 2005, which featured a version of &quot;The Frighteners&quot; that is 14 minutes longer. The other side includes a documentary prepared by Jackson and WingNut Films originally for the Laserdisc release. The theatrical and director&#x27;s cuts were also made available on HD-DVD in 2007, and Blu-ray in 2011.

<text>Taswell is a census-designated place in Patoka Township, Crawford County, Indiana, located on State Road 64 west of the county seat of English.

==History==
A post office was established at Taswell in 1882, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1996. It was intended that the community be named for the Laswell family of settlers, but when the postal authorities misspelled the name Taswell, the new name stuck.

<text>Devil&#x27;s Bridge (, lit. &quot;The bridge on the Mynach&quot;) is a village and community in Ceredigion, Wales. Above the River Mynach on the edge of the village is a series of three stacked bridges, constructed hundreds of years apart, from which the village gets its English name.
The village is on the A4120 road, about east of Aberystwyth.

The population of Pontarfynach community at the 2011 census was 455. The mid-2016 estimate suggests that the population had dropped slightly to 429.

== The bridges ==

The village is best known for the three bridges that span the Afon Mynach, a tributary of the Rheidol. The bridge is unique in that three separate bridges are coexistent, each one built upon the previous bridge. The previous structures were not demolished.

The river has been bridged since at least the 12th century, with a wooden bridge built . According to legend, it was built after an old woman lost her cow and saw it grazing on the other side of the river. The Devil appeared and agreed to build a bridge in return for the soul of the first living thing to cross it. When the bridge was finished, the old woman threw a crust of bread over the river, which her dog crossed the bridge to retrieve, thus becoming the first living thing to cross it. The devil was left with only the soul of the dog.

The lowest arch of the current bridge is ancient, possibly medieval. It is a stone arch, and the oldest part of the structure that is still standing.

In 1753, the bridge was repaired, and a second stone arch was added when the original bridge was thought to be unstable. The builders used the original bridge to support scaffolding during construction and added a second arch.

In 1901, an iron bridge was erected above the older arches, and eliminated the slope in the roadway. In 1971, the steelwork and railings were repaired and the bridge was strengthened.

The bridge is at a point where the River Mynach drops in five steps down a steep and narrow ravine before it meets the River Rheidol. The set of stone steps, known as Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, a circular walk for tourists, leads down to a modern metal bridge below the waterfalls.

==History==
The name in 1629 was or , meaning &quot;Bridge over the Mynach&quot;. The word is Welsh for monk; one theory is that the river got its name from the fact that it was near land owned by a monastery. The first mention of the structure using the English name Devil&#x27;s Bridge, in historical records, is from 1734.

The bridges that the village is named after were Grade II Listed on 21 January 1964, &quot;as a remarkable succession of three superimposed bridges, one of the best known picturesque sites in Wales&quot; and the listing was updated in 2005.

==Tourism and notable sites==

Devil&#x27;s Bridge has been a tourist attraction for centuries. Records indicate that tourists were coming to this area by the mid-1700s and that an inn or hotel has existed nearby since before 1796.

The area was once part of the Hafod Estate, owned by Thomas Johnes who built a small hunting lodge on the estate which was eventually expanded into an inn. The building burned down and was rebuilt. Significant renovations were completed in 1837–1839 and in the 1860s. After several expansions and upgrades, it has been operated as the &quot;Hafod Hotel&quot;, using this name since the 1860s. In 2017, new owners had arranged for a survey in preparation for a major renovation; they intended to maintain much of the historical character of the building. Some interior renovation work had been completed by September 2017.

The artist J. M. W. Turner sketched the bridge; this work is at the Tate Gallery, London. He also produced two watercolours of the area in 1795. In 1824, William Wordsworth published a poem, &quot;To the Torrent at the Devil’s Bridge, North Wales&quot;.

The celebrated English author George Borrow wrote &quot;Wild Wales&quot; (1854), which includes a lively, humorous account of his visit to Pontarfynach. The George Borrow Hotel, a 17th-century inn where he reputedly stayed, is nearby; it is located between Devil&#x27;s Bridge and Pontrhydygroeis Hafod Uchtryd.

Tourism to the area increased after the bridge and the Hafod building were featured in the &quot;Hinterland&quot; TV series, which has been broadcast in numerous countries. The hotel was presented, using flashbacks, as a children&#x27;s home that had been closed down and turned into a guest house. Some tourists also enjoy the nearby nature trail, waterfalls and the historic steam railway. Other places of interest and attractions are located a short drive from the area, some in Aberystwyth.

Mary Lloyd Jones (born 1934), a Welsh painter and printmaker based in Aberystwyth was born in Devil&#x27;s Bridge.

The address for the Devil&#x27;s Bridge area is Woodlands (referring to the caravan park where free parking is available), Devil&#x27;s Bridge, Ceredigion, Wales, SY23 3JW. The bridge is on the A4120, with sign posts providing guidance from the village centre.

==Transport==

Devil&#x27;s Bridge railway station is the upper terminus of the historic narrow-gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway, which opened between Aberystwyth and Devil&#x27;s Bridge in 1902.

The village is served by one bus route, the 522, which runs between Tregaron and Aberystwyth; there is one service daily in each direction on weekdays and it is operated by Mid Wales Travel.

==Popular culture==
Devil&#x27;s Bridge and the hotel building are featured prominently in the opening two episodes of the first series of the 2013 Welsh-language crime noir, (episodes titled in English &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bridge&quot; and &quot;Night Music&quot;), shown on S4C and subsequently on BBC4 as &quot;Hinterland&quot;. Both are featured again in series 3 of the programme. The three series are streamed on Netflix in Canada and the US and also in Japan, Taiwan, India, South Africa, South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

<text>The geology of the Grand Teton area consists of some of the oldest rocks and one of the youngest mountain ranges in North America. The Teton Range, partly located in Grand Teton National Park, started to grow some 9 million years ago. An older feature, Jackson Hole, is a basin that sits aside the range.

The 2.5 billion year old metamorphic rocks that make up the east face of the Tetons are marine in origin and include some volcanic deposits. These same rocks are today buried deep inside Jackson Hole. Paleozoic rocks were deposited in warm shallow seas while Mesozoic deposition transitioned back and forth from marine to non-marine sediments with the Cretaceous Seaway periodically covering the area late in that era.

==Precambrian deposition, metamorphism, and intrusion==
Perhaps 3 billion years ago in Precambrian time, sand, limey ooze, silt and clay were deposited in a marine trough (accurate dating is not possible, due to subsequent partial recrystallization of the resulting rock). Between these layers were volcanic deposits, probably from an island arc. These sediments were later lithified into sandstones, limestones, and various shales. These rocks were below the surface when orogenies (mountain-building episodes) around 2.8 to 2.7 billion years ago intensely folded and metamorphosed them, creating alternating light and dark banded gneiss and schist. Today these rocks dominate the east side of the Teton Range with good examples easily viewable in Death Canyon and other canyons. The green to black serpentine created was used by Native Americans to make bowls.
Sometime around 2.5 billion years ago, blobs of magma intruded into the older rock, forming plutons of granitic rock. Extensive exposures of this rock are found in the central part of the range. About 1.3 to 1.4 billion years ago in Late Precambrian, thick black diabase dikes intruded as well, forming the prominent vertical dikes seen today on the faces of Mount Moran and Middle Teton (the dike on Mount Moran is ). Some of the large dikes can be seen from the Jenny Lake and String Lake areas.

More than 700 million years elapsed between intrusion of the black dikes and deposition of the first Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The Precambrian rocks were uplifted during this gap in the geologic record known as an unconformity; exposed to erosion they were gradually worn to a nearly featureless plain, perhaps resembling the vast flat areas in which similar Precambrian rocks are now exposed in central and eastern Canada. At the close of Precambrian time, about 600 million years ago, the plain slowly subsided and the site of the future Teton Range disappeared beneath shallow seas that were to wash across it intermittently for the next 500 million years.

==Paleozoic deposition==
Deposition resumed in the Cambrian period and continued through the Paleozoic era, creating nine major formations which together are thick (the only geologic period in the Paleozoic not represented is the Silurian). These formations were deposited in a shallow sea and later became a discontinuous mix of dolomites, limestones, sandstones, and shales. These formations are relatively undeformed for their age even though periodic upwarp exposed them to erosion, creating uncomformities. Fossilized brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, and trilobites are found in the carbonate rocks with the best examples found outside of the park in the Alaska Basin. The most complete examples of these formations are found to the west, north, and south of park borders.

===On the edge of a shallow seaway===

Early in Cambrian time a shallow seaway, called the Cordilleran trough, extended from southern California northeastward across Nevada into Utah and Idaho. The vast gently rolling plain on Precambrian rocks to the east was drained by sluggish westward-flowing rivers that carried sand and mud into the sea. The site of the Teton Range was part of this plain. Slow subsidence of the land caused the sea to spread gradually eastward during Middle Cambrian time flooding the Precambrian plain. Sand accumulated along the beaches just as it does today. As the sea moved still farther east, mud was deposited on the now-submerged beach sand. In the Teton area, the oldest sand deposit is the thick Flathead Sandstone. The partly marine Flathead Sandstone is reddish-brown, very hard, brittle and exposures can be found on the north and west flanks of the Teton Range and Gros Ventre Range.

Mud was laid down on top of the Flathead Sandstone as the shoreline advanced eastward across the Teton area. The resulting soft greenish-gray shale with beds of purple and green sandstone near its base, became the thick Wolsey Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks that formed when the accumulating mud was briefly exposed to the air along tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals called brachiopods inhabited these tidal flats but as far as is known, nothing lived on land. Many shale beds are marked with faint trails and borings of worm-like creatures, and a few contain the remains of tiny trilobites.

===Covered by a shallow sea===

As the shoreline continued to move eastward, the 285-foot-thick (87 m) Death Canyon Limestone Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was laid down in clear water farther from shore. It consists of two thick beds of dark blue-gray limestone that are separated by of shale. The Death Canyon contains abundant fossil of brachiopods and trilobites in some places. Following this the sea retreated to the west for a short time. The 220-foot-thick (67 m) Park Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was deposited in the shallow muddy water resulting from this retreat. It is a gray-green shale that contains beds of platy limestone conglomerate along with fossils of trilobites and brachiopods. Underwater expanses of algae flourished in places on the sea bottom and built extensive reefs. Periodically shoal areas were hit by violent storm waves that tore loose platy fragments of recently solidified limestone and swept them into nearby channels where they were buried and cemented into thin beds of jumbled fragments called &#x27;edgewise&#x27; conglomerate. These are widespread in the shale and in overlying and underlying limestone layers.

By Late Cambrian, the shoreline had once again crept eastward, resulting in clearer water that was probably deep. The 100-foot-thick (30 m) Gallatin Limestone was formed. It consists of blue-gray limestone that is mottled with irregular rusty or yellow patches. Interrupting the limestone are a few beds of &#x27;edgewise&#x27; conglomerate that are indicative of sporadic storms. Now at its maximum extent, the sea covered all of Idaho, Montana, most of Wyoming and extended eastward across the Dakotas to connect with shallow seas that covered the eastern United States. Soon after, a slow uplift caused the sea to gradually retreat westward. The site of the Teton Range emerged above sea level, where, as far as is known, it may have been exposed to erosion for nearly 70 million years.

===Uplift puts the area back on the sea&#x27;s edge===

The Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite forms ragged hard massive light-gray to white cliffs 100 to high. Dolomite is calcium-magnesium carbonate, but the original sediment probably was calcium carbonate mud that was altered by magnesium-rich sea water shortly after deposition. Corals and other marine animals were abundant in the clear warm seas at this time.

Dolomite in the Devonian Darby Formation differs greatly from the Bighorn Dolomite; in the Darby is dark-brown to almost black, has an oily smell, and contains layers of black, pink, and yellow mudstone and thin sandstone. The sea bottom during deposition of these rocks was foul and frequently the water was turbid. Abundant fossil fragments indicate fishes were common for the first time. Exposures of the Darby Formation are recognizable by their distinctive dull-yellow thin-layered slopes between the prominent gray massive cliffs of formations below and above.

The Mississippian Madison Limestone is thick and is exposed in spectacular vertical cliffs along canyons in the north, west, and south parts of the Tetons. It is noted for the abundant remains of beautifully preserved marine organisms. The fossils and the relatively pure blue-gray limestone in which they are embedded indicate deposition in warm tranquil seas. The Fossil Mountain Ice Cave—Wind Cave system on the west side of the Teton range was dissolved out of this rock by water.

The Pennsylvanian system is represented by the Amsden Formation and the Tensleep Sandstone. Cliffs of the Tensleep Sandstone can be seen along the Gros Ventre River at the east edge of the park. The Amsden, below the Tensleep, consists of red and green shale, sandstone, and thin limestone. The shale is especially weak and slippery when exposed to weathering and saturated with water. These are the strata that make up the glide plane of the Lower Gros Ventre Slide east of the park.

The Phosphoria Formation and its equivalents of Permian age are unlike any other Paleozoic rocks because of their extraordinary content of uncommon elements. The formation consists of sandy dolomite, widespread black phosphate beds and black shale that is unusually rich not only in phosphorus, but also in vanadium, uranium, chromium, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, and silver. The formation is mined extensively in nearby parts of Idaho and in Wyoming for phosphatic fertilizer, for the chemical element phosphorus, and for some of the metals that can be derived from the rocks as by-products. These elements and compounds are not everywhere concentrated enough to be of economic interest, but their dollar-value is, in a regional sense, comparable to that of some of the world&#x27;s greatest mineral deposits.

==Mesozoic deposition==

Mesozoic deposition changed from primarily marine to a mix of marine, transitional, and continental that varied over time as crustal conditions altered the region. By the close of this era, of sediment accumulated in 15 recognized formations. The most extensive non-marine formations were deposited in the Cretaceous period when the eastern part of the Cretaceous Seaway (a warm shallow sea that periodically divided North America in that period) covered the region. Their sediment came from rock eroded from a mountain chain east of the seaway interspersed with ash from volcanos west of the seaway in the Sierran Arc (a long volcanic island chain like the modern Andes Mountains but in island form). This ash eventually became bentonite, a clay which expands in water and thus causes landslides in the park.

Regional uplift in latest Cretaceous time caused the seaway to retreat and transformed the Grand Teton area into a low-lying coastal plain that was frequented by dinosaurs (a fossilized &quot;Triceratops&quot; was found east of the park near Togwotee Pass). Coalbeds were eventually created from the swamps and bogs left behind after the last stand of the seaway retreated. Coal outcrops can be found near abandoned mines in and outside of the eastern margin of the park. Outcrops of older Mesozoic-aged formations can be found north, east, and south of the park.

===Sundance Sea covers older deposits===
Most of the basal part of the Mesozoic sequence consists of the more than thick, soft, bright-red, and Triassic-aged rocks known as the Chugwater Formation. The distribution of Mud cracks, fossilized reptiles and amphibians suggest deposition in a tidal flat environment with a sea several kilometers southwest of Jackson Hole. Evaporite deposits of a few beds of white gypsum (calcium sulfate) were likely formed after shallow bodies of salt water were cut off from the sea. A small amount of iron oxide creates the red color and the formation erodes into colorful hills east and south of the park.

As the Triassic gave way to the Jurassic, wind spread salmon-red colored sand across the red beds of the Chugwater Formation to form the Nugget Sandstone. The Nugget in turn was buried by the deposits of thin red shale and thick gypsum of the Gypsum Springs Formation. Later, a warm, muddy, shallow sea with abundant marine mollusks called the Sundance Sea started to spread from Alaska south to Wyoming. More than of soft gray fossil-rich shale and thin beds of limestone and sandstones were deposited. After the sea withdrew, the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous-aged Morrison and Cloverly Formations were laid down on low-lying tropically humid flood plains. These formations erode into colorful badlands of red, pink, purple, and green claystones and mudstones, and yellow to buff sandstones. Large and small dinosaurs roamed the abundant vegetation and swamps.

===Western Interior Seaway expands and retracts===
Brightly colored rocks continued to be deposited as the final period of the Mesozoic, the Cretaceous dawned. Another warm, shallow sea, the Western Interior Seaway, then partly and sometimes completely covered the Teton region along with most of Wyoming, About of drab-colored sand, silt, and clay with some coal beds, volcanic ash layers, and minor amounts of gravel were deposited.

The Western Interior Seaway retreated eastward from the Teton region around 85 million years ago, marked by deposition of the Bacon Ridge Sandstone. Extensive coal swamps formed along and followed the retreating seashore, leaving coal beds 5 to thick in the Upper Cretaceous strata. Examples of these coal beds are visible in abandoned mines found in the eastern margin of the park. A modern analog of this depositional environment is the hot and humid climate of the Florida Everglades. About of compacted plant material is needed to form of coal.

Fine-grained volcanic ash from volcanoes west and northwest of the Teton area was periodically deposited in the quiet shallow water of the Western Interior Seaway throughout Cretaceous time. Ash deposited in this manner was later altered to bentonite; a type of clay used in the foundry industry and as a component of oil well drilling mud. Elk and deer in Jackson Hole use exposures of bentonite as a (bitter) salt lick. Bentonite swells when wet, which causes landslides that sometimes block access roads into Jackson Hole.

Cretaceous-aged rocks in the Teton region form part of a huge east-thinning wedge of crust that is locally almost thick. Most of these rocks are from debris eroded from slowly rising mountains in the west. Bentonite, crude oil and natural gas are commonly produced from the various Cretaceous formations. Enormous coal reserves, with some beds reaching 50 to thick, are a potentially vast resource.

By the end of the Cretaceous, slightly more than 80 million years ago, the region&#x27;s landscape was flat and monotonous; a condition that persisted during most of the Late Cretaceous.

===Rocky Mountains rise===
The period of uplift that resulted in the formation of the ancestral Rocky Mountains is called the Laramide orogeny. Mountains already existed west and southwest of Wyoming, with progressively older mountains (up to Jurassic age) trending west into Nevada. Latest Cretaceous time saw the formation of a low broad northwest-trending arch along the approximate area of the present Teton Range and Gros Ventre Mountains.

Part of the evidence for the first Laramide mountain building west of the Teton region is the several hundred cubic miles of quartzite boulders derived from the Targhee uplift, which was located north and west of the northern end of the present-day Teton Range. Streams carried boulders, sand, and clay from the uplift eastward and southeastward across what would become Jackson Hole. Flakes of gold and some mercury are in the resulting Harebell Formation. Two huge depositional troughs were formed in central and southern Wyoming from fine-grained debris carried farther east and southeast. Many of the larger boulders were derived from Precambrian and possibly lower Paleozoic quartzites, meaning that at least of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock must have been stripped from the Targhee uplift before the quartzites were exposed to erosion.

==Tertiary uplift and deposition==
The tectonic setting of western North America changed drastically as the Farallon Plate under the Pacific Ocean to the west was shallowly subducted below North American Plate. Called the Laramide orogeny, the compressive forces generated from this collision erased the Cretaceous Seaway, fused the Sierran Arc to the rest of North America and created the Rocky Mountains. This mountain-building event started in the Mesozoic 80 million years ago and lasted well into the first half of the Cenozoic era 30 million years ago.
Some 60 million years ago, these forces uplifted the low-lying coastal plain in the Teton region and created the north–south-trending thrust faults of the nearby Wyoming Overthrust Belt. Uplift intensified and climaxed a few million years later early in the Eocene epoch when large thrust and reverse faults created small mountain ranges separated by subsiding sedimentary basins. One of the reverse faults, the north–south trending long Buck Mountain Fault, elevated what is today the central part of the Teton Range.

By about 34 million years ago, these forces had uplifted a broad part of western Wyoming into a continuous high plateau. This region includes areas now occupied by the Teton Range, Gros Ventre Range, Wind River Mountains and other mountain ranges to the south and east of the Tetons. A separate area of uplift called the Targhee Uplift formed north of park borders around this time.

Subsequent erosion of the Targhee Uplift was driven by steepened stream gradients. Gravel, quartzite cobbles, and sand from this erosion eventually became the thick Harebell Formation seen today as various conglomerates and sandstones in the northern and northeastern parts of the park. In the Paleocene epoch large amounts of clastic sediment derived from uplifted areas covered the Harebell Formation to become the Pinyon Conglomerate. The lower members of this formation consist of coal beds and claystone with conglomerate made of quartzite from the Targhee uplift above.

The subducting Farallon Plate was eventually completely consumed below the North American Plate, bringing an end to the Laramide orogeny. Hot and semi-plastic rock deep below western North America responded to the lack of compression beginning 30 million years ago by slowly rising; gradually pushing the overlying rock sideways both east and west. Blocks of the brittle upper crust responded by breaking along roughly parallel north-to-south trending normal faults that each have a subsiding basin on one side and a mountain range on the other. This stretching may have begun to tear apart the previously mentioned high plateau in western Wyoming around this time, but evidence from ancient sediments indicates that the Teton Fault system developed much later (see below). An eastward-moving intensification of this process began 17 million years ago, creating the Basin and Range geologic province in Nevada and western Utah. Stretching of the crust in this region eventually exceeded , doubling the distance between Reno, Nevada, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

Waning of the Laramide orogeny coincided with volcanic eruptions from two parallel volcanic chains separated by a long valley in the Yellowstone-Absaroka area to the north. Huge volumes of volcanic material such as tuff and ash accumulated to great depth in the Grand Teton area, forming the Absaroka Volcanic Supergroup. Additional eruptions east of Jackson Hole deposited their own debris in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs.
Sediment collected in various lakes in the area from around 17 to 15 million years ago, becoming the Miocene-aged Colter Formation. Beginning around 13 million years ago (also in the Miocene), a 40-mile (64-km) long steeply east dipping normal fault system called the Teton Fault started to vertically move two adjacent blocks. One block, the Jackson Hole basin, moved down while the other block, containing the westward-tilting eastern part of the Teton Range, moved up; thus creating the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. Most of the downward movement occurred right next to the fault, resulting in a 15° tilt of the Colter Formation. No sediment was deposited on top of the tilted Colter Formation for up to three million years, resulting in an angular unconformity as the tilted Colter partially eroded away.

Around 10 million years ago, Jackson Hole&#x27;s first large freshwater lake was impounded by east–west fault movement in what is today the southern end of the park. Geologists call this fault-scarp dammed body of shallow water Lake Teewinot and it persisted for around 5 million years. The resulting Teewinot Formation of lakebed sediments sits directly on the Colter and consists of limestones and claystones mixed with volcanic material and fossilized clams and snails. All told, sediments in the Tertiary period attained an aggregate thickness of around , forming the most complete non-marine Tertiary geologic column in the United States. Most of these units within the park are, however, buried under younger deposits.

Eventually all the Mesozoic rock from the Teton Range was stripped away and the same formations in Jackson Hole were deeply buried. A prominent outcrop of the pink-colored Flathead Sandstone exists above the valley floor on the summit of Mount Moran. Drilling in Jackson Hole found the same formation below the valley&#x27;s surface, indicating that the two blocks have been displaced from each other. Thus an average of one foot of movement occurred every 300 years (1 cm per year on average).

==Quaternary volcanic deposits and ice ages==
Massive volcanic eruptions from the Yellowstone Volcano northwest of the area occurred 2.2 million, 1.3 million, and 630,000 years ago. Each catastrophic caldera-forming eruption was preceded by a long period of more conventional eruptions along even earlier volcanic episodes. One such event sent large amounts of Rhyolitic lava into the northern extent of Teewinot Lake. The resulting obsidian (volcanic glass) has been potassium-argon dated to 9 million years and was used by Native Americans starting thousands of years ago to make arrowheads, knives, and spear points. The lake was dry by the time a series of enormous pyroclastic flows from the Yellowstone area buried Jackson Hole under welded tuff. Older exposures of this tuff are exposed in the Bivouac Formation at Signal Mountain and Pleistocene-aged tuffs are found capping East and West Gros Venture Buttes (both the mountain and buttes are small fault blocks).

Climatic conditions in the area gradually changed through the Cenozoic as plate tectonics moved North America northwest from a sub-tropical to a temperate zone by the Pliocene epoch. The onset of a series of glaciations in the Pleistocene epoch saw the introduction of large glaciers in the Teton and surrounding ranges, which flowed all the way to Jackson Hole during at least three ice ages. Cascade, Garnet, Death and Granite Canyons were all carved by successive periods of glaciation.

The first and most severe of the known glacial advances in the area was caused by the Buffalo glaciation. In that event the individual alpine (mountain valley) glaciers from the Tetons&#x27; east side coalesced to form a thick apron of ice that overrode and abraded Signal Mountain and the other three buttes at the south end of Jackson Hole. Similar dramas were repeated on other ranges in the region, eventually forming part of the Canadian Ice Sheet, which at its maximum, extended into eastern Idaho. This continental-sized glacial system stripped all the soil and vegetation from countless valleys and many basins, leaving them a wasteland of bedrock strewn with boulders after the glaciers finally retreated. Parts of Jackson Hole that were not touched by the following milder glaciations still cannot support anything but the hardiest plants (smaller glaciers deposit glacial till and small rocks relatively near their source, while continental glaciers transport all but the largest fragments far away).

A less severe glaciation, known as Bull Lake, started sometime between 160 and 130 thousand years ago. Bull Lake helped repair some of the damage of the Buffalo event by forming smaller glaciers which deposited loose material over the bedrock. In that event, the large glacier which ran down Jackson Hole only extended just south of where Jackson, Wyoming, now sits and melted about 100,000 years ago. 

Then from 25,000 to 10,000 years ago the lower volume Wisconsin glaciation carved many of the glacial features seen today. Burned Ridge is made of the terminal moraine (rubble dump) of the largest of these glaciers to affect the area. Today this hummocky feature is covered with trees and other vegetation. Smaller moraines from a less severe part of the Pinedale were formed just below the base of each large valley in the Teton Range by alpine glaciers. Many of these piles of glacial rubble created depressions that in modern times are filled with a series of small lakes (Leigh, String, Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Phelps). Jackson Lake is the largest of these and was impounded by a recessional moraine left by the last major glacier in Jackson Hole. A collection of kettles (depressions left by melted stagnant ice blocks from a retreating glacier) south of the lake is called the Potholes. The basins that hold Two Ocean Lake and Emma Matilda Lake were created during the Bull Lake glaciation. Since then humans have built a dam over Jackson Lake&#x27;s outlet to increase its size for recreational purposes.

All Pinedale glaciers probably melted away soon after the start of the Holocene epoch. The dozen small cirque glaciers seen today were formed during a subsequent neoglaciation 5000 years ago. Mount Moran has five such glaciers with Triple Glaciers on the north face, Skillet Glacier on the east face, and Falling Ice Glacier on the southeast face. All the glacial action has made the peaks of the Teton Range jagged from frost wedging. Other glaciers include Teton Glacier, below the east face of Grand Teton, Middle Teton Glacier, situated on the northeast slopes of Middle Teton, and the fast retreating Schoolroom Glacier, west of Grand Teton at Hurricane Pass.

Mass wasting events such as the 1925 Gros Ventre landslide continue to change the area. On June 22, 1925, an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 4 weakened the side of a mountain located outside of the current park&#x27;s southeastern border. The next day, 50 million cubic yards (38 million cubic meters) of water-saturated Pennsylvanian-aged Tensleep Sandstone slid from its source on Sheep Mountain and into the Gros Ventre River valley below, damming the river. Stressed by snow melt, the resulting long and deep lake breached the debris dam on May 18, 1927, and flooded the town of Kelly, Wyoming, killing six.

<doc id="768817" wikidata="Q2844542" url="?curid=768817" title="Amusement">
<text>Amusement is the state of experiencing humorous and entertaining events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with enjoyment, happiness, laughter and pleasure. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.

Amusement is considered an &quot;epistemological&quot; emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke. Emotions perceived overtime are focused on the daily dynamics of life as augment or blunt. The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.

Current studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and sociology. In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less &#x27;amusing&#x27; than another similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.

==Theories==

Two different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:

=== Evolutionary ===
The evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included. It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.

=== Constructed emotion ===
The theory of constructed emotion suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.

== Emotional expression of amusement ==
The origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to Charles Darwin. In 1872, Darwin published his book &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;, in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound. Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, Paul Ekman, an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable. His early work focused on six basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement.

Displays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame. More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.

=== Facial expression ===
An amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:
*Head: Thrown back with jaw lifted
*Eyes: Crow&#x27;s feet at the eyes indicating that the muscles have tightened
*Mouth: Open, jaw dropped with relaxed muscles

=== Vocal burst ===
The expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.

== Cultural considerations ==

As a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.

==Clinical uses==
=== Emotion regulation ===

Emotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining, or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion. Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration). Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.

=== Resilience ===

As a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children and adults. Positive emotions help people build social resources that foster their ability to cope during hard times. Increases in resilience lead to higher life satisfaction and general happiness. 
=== Laughter therapy ===

Rapidly growing in popularity, laughter therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool. Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the body&#x27;s muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake. Proposed benefits include: Stress management, relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion, and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state. However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.

<text>Lobaye is one of the 20 prefectures of the Central African Republic. Its capital is Mbaïki. In 2024, official estimates suggest the population reached 361,289 inhabitants.

Emperor Duy Tân of Vietnam died here on December 26, 1945 in a plane crash. David Dacko, the first and third president of the Central African Republic from 1960–1965 and 1979–1981, was from Lobaye.

==Location==
The prefecture is located in the southern part of the country, bordering the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It shares borders with the prefectures of Mambéré-Kadéï to the northwest, Sangha-Mbaéré to the west, and Ombella-M&#x27;Poko to the northeast.
It is named for the Lobaye River.

==Economy==
Besides Mbaïki, other important cities include Boda, in the north, and Mongoumba, by the Ubangi River.

Most of the inhabitants are coffea farmers. Most of the farmers are extremely poor; most children do not go to college, and many die due to lack of medical care.

<text>Technique is the fifth studio album by English rock band New Order. Released on 30 January 1989 by Factory Records, the album was partly recorded on the island of Ibiza, and incorporates Balearic beat and acid house influences into the group&#x27;s dance-rock sound. The album was influenced by the then growing acid scene, and Sumner&#x27;s experiences at Shoom in London.

&quot;Technique&quot; was the first New Order album to reach number one on the UK charts, and &quot;Fine Time&quot;, the first single from the album, reached number 11. Remixed versions of &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot; and &quot;Run&quot; were also released as singles.

==Recording==
In the late 1980s, the band felt that they had to keep on playing with dance-electronic rhythms. Bernard Sumner reflected; &quot;We were in this position of being known for this dance-electronic sound and it would have been daft to have just stopped doing it. That was the nature of the time. The way I saw it was we were still writing band music as well, so we&#x27;d reached a compromise.&quot; Peter Hook joked that the album was &quot;an epic power struggle between the sequencers and me. I was resisting it valiantly, because I still wanted us to be a rock band.&quot;

Sumner wrote all of the lyrics. When recording on the island of Ibiza, the band was heavily influenced by the environment around them and became fascinated by Balearic club music. Gillian Gilbert recalled, &quot;We had Mike (Johnson, engineer) with us, so there was always somebody doing something, but it was the beginning of us not being together in the studio when we were doing things. It was like, &#x27;oh you do your drums today, and I&#x27;ll do the vocals tonight...&#x27; The songs were sort of there but there were huge chunks missing. You&#x27;d leave blocks and say, &#x27;will you fill that in? I&#x27;m off now.&#x27;&quot; The band had chosen to record in Ibiza at Hook&#x27;s urging after a series of records made in &quot;dark and horrible&quot; London studios. Stephen Morris described the sound of the Balearic beat clubs on the island they began to visit as &quot;mad! They&#x27;d put an acid record on and then the next one would be a Queen one—it was schizophrenic, really. It&#x27;d be something really Spanish and then something really daft. It was a really odd mix but it all seemed to make sense when you were there. I don&#x27;t know why that was. Maybe because we were all a bit out of our brains.&quot;

Following four months spent in Ibiza (with the album &quot;20% complete&quot;, according to Sumner), the band shifted to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios to finish recording, which Sumner referred to as a &quot;much more sober atmosphere&quot;.

==Composition==
For Hook, &quot;&quot;Technique&quot; sounds fantastic [...] considering it&#x27;s not an Ibizan dance record. I think it catches a summer sound really brilliantly.&quot; Morris mentioned that the album had an &quot;end of term, last day of school feel about it&quot;. To promote the album, music videos were produced for the three singles. An instrumental version of &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; was used at the time on the BBC series &quot;Making Out&quot;.

John Denver&#x27;s publishing company later filed a lawsuit, alleging that the guitar break in &quot;Run&quot; too closely resembled Denver&#x27;s &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;. The case was settled out of court.

==Reception==
&quot;Technique&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. Chris Roberts of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; hailed the album as &quot;a rare and ravishing triumph&quot;, while John Tague of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the band had &quot;fashioned an LP of unflinching honesty, free from the masks of false identities of their past.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau called New Order a &quot;lot franker and happier (hence smarter) than Depeche Mode&quot; and felt that the band had &quot;lightened up&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Craig Lee wrote that &quot;with the exception of &#x27;Fine Time,&#x27; there may be little new ground broken here, but when it comes to the sound of a broken psyche, New Order never misses a beat.&quot; Ira Robbins, in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stated that &quot;Technique&quot; &quot;delivers a solid blast of sonic presence with immaculate playing&quot; and called it a &quot;surprisingly inviting album from this generally reserved outfit&quot;.

&quot;Technique&quot; has since garnered critical acclaim in retrospective reviews. John Bush of AllMusic referred to the album as &quot;another classic record&quot; by New Order and stated that their &quot;instincts for blending rock and contemporary dance resulted in another confident, superb LP.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Alternative Record Guide&quot; cited &quot;Technique&quot; as New Order&#x27;s best album because it represented the perfect synthesis of the band&#x27;s abilities as a punk-influenced rock band and as synthpop pioneers. David Quantick of &quot;Uncut&quot; called it a &quot;powerfully contradictory album: not only is it an Ibiza record that&#x27;s New Order&#x27;s least techno-ey, but it&#x27;s a chirpy, upbeat album with mature lyrics&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Josh Modell referred to &quot;Technique&quot; as New Order&#x27;s &quot;last truly great album&quot;, as did BBC Music&#x27;s Ian Wade, who added that the album showed &quot;a New Order ready for the next decade, adding to their already superb reputation.&quot; Keith Gwillim of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; contended that New Order &quot;may have made better records, but none of them defines them, sounds so quintessentially like what they were always reaching for, quite as well as &quot;Technique&quot;.&quot;

Tom Ewing of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; labelled &quot;Technique&quot; &quot;magnificent&quot; in 2008 and stated that the album &quot;takes the easy interplay and full-band sound of &quot;Brotherhood&quot; and drenches it in good Ibiza vibes&quot;. However, he criticised the Collector&#x27;s Edition bonus material as containing only &quot;listless B-sides and instrumentals, and merely functional remixes&quot;.

&quot;Technique&quot; has been listed by several publications as one of the best albums of the 1980s and of all time. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at number 21 on its list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 122 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2013. The album is also included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Vakaga is one of the 20 prefectures of the Central African Republic. Its capital is Birao. It covers an area of 46,500 km and has a population of 52,255 (2003 census). In 2024, official estimates suggest the population reached 89,189 inhabitants.

The extremely low population density, 1.1 people/km, is a result of the capture of the majority of the region&#x27;s inhabitants by slave-traders from the Sudan in the second half of the nineteenth century. Vakaga is known for its oil reserves.

<text>In polymer chemistry, a copolymer is a polymer derived from more than one species of monomer. The polymerization of monomers into copolymers is called copolymerization. Copolymers obtained from the copolymerization of two monomer species are sometimes called &quot;bipolymers&quot;. Those obtained from three and four monomers are called terpolymers and &quot;quaterpolymers&quot;, respectively. Copolymers can be characterized by a variety of techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography to determine the molecular size, weight, properties, and composition of the material.

Commercial copolymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), styrene/butadiene co-polymer (SBR), nitrile rubber, styrene-acrylonitrile, styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) and ethylene-vinyl acetate, all of which are formed by chain-growth polymerization. Another production mechanism is step-growth polymerization, which is used to produce the nylon-12/6/66 copolymer of nylon 12, nylon 6 and nylon 66, as well as the copolyester family. Copolymers can be used to develop commercial goods or drug delivery vehicles.
Since a copolymer consists of at least two types of constituent units (also structural units), copolymers can be classified based on how these units are arranged along the chain. &quot;Linear copolymers&quot; consist of a single main chain and include alternating copolymers, statistical copolymers, and block copolymers. &quot;Branched copolymers&quot; consist of a single main chain with one or more polymeric side chains, and can be grafted, star shaped, or have other architectures.

==Reactivity ratios==
The &quot;reactivity ratio&quot; of a growing copolymer chain terminating in a given monomer is the ratio of the reaction rate constant for addition of the same monomer and the rate constant for addition of the other monomer. That is, formula_1 and formula_2, where for example formula_3 is the rate constant for propagation of a polymer chain ending in monomer 1 (or A) by addition of monomer 2 (or B).

The composition and structural type of the copolymer depend on these reactivity ratios r1 and r2 according to the Mayo–Lewis equation, also called the copolymerization equation or copolymer equation, for the relative instantaneous rates of incorporation of the two monomers.

==Linear copolymers==

===Block copolymers===

Block copolymers comprise two or more homopolymer subunits linked by covalent bonds. The union of the homopolymer subunits may require an intermediate non-repeating subunit, known as a junction block. Diblock copolymers have two distinct blocks; triblock copolymers have three. Technically, a block is a portion of a macromolecule, comprising many units, that has at least one feature which is not present in the adjacent portions. A possible sequence of repeat units A and B in a triblock copolymer might be ~A-A-A-A-A-A-A-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-A-A-A-A-A~.

Block copolymers are made up of blocks of different polymerized monomers. For example, polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) or PS-b-PMMA (where b = block) is usually made by first polymerizing styrene, and then subsequently polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) from the reactive end of the polystyrene chains. This polymer is a &quot;diblock copolymer&quot; because it contains two different chemical blocks. Triblocks, tetrablocks, multiblocks, etc. can also be made. Diblock copolymers are made using living polymerization techniques, such as atom transfer free radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and living cationic or living anionic polymerizations. An emerging technique is chain shuttling polymerization.

The synthesis of block copolymers requires that both reactivity ratios are much larger than unity (r1 » 1, r2 » 1) under the reaction conditions, so that the terminal monomer unit of a growing chain tends to add a similar unit most of the time.

The &quot;blockiness&quot; of a copolymer is a measure of the adjacency of comonomers vs their statistical distribution. Many or even most synthetic polymers are in fact copolymers, containing about 1-20% of a minority monomer. In such cases, blockiness is undesirable. A &quot;block index&quot; has been proposed as a quantitative measure of blockiness or deviation from random monomer composition.

===Alternating copolymers===
An alternating copolymer has regular alternating A and B units, and is often described by the formula: -A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-, or -(-A-B-)n-. The molar ratio of each monomer in the polymer is normally close to one, which happens when the reactivity ratios r1 and r2 are close to zero, as can be seen from the Mayo–Lewis equation. For example, in the free-radical copolymerization of styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, r1 = 0.097 and r2 = 0.001, so that most chains ending in styrene add a maleic anhydride unit, and almost all chains ending in maleic anhydride add a styrene unit. This leads to a predominantly alternating structure.

A step-growth copolymer -(-A-A-B-B-)n- formed by the condensation of two bifunctional monomers A–A and B–B is in principle a perfectly alternating copolymer of these two monomers, but is usually considered as a homopolymer of the dimeric repeat unit A-A-B-B. An example is nylon 66 with repeat unit -OC-( CH2)4-CO-NH-(CH2)6-NH-, formed from a dicarboxylic acid monomer and a diamine monomer.

===Periodic copolymers===

Periodic copolymers have units arranged in a repeating sequence. For two monomers A and B, for example, they might form the repeated pattern (A-B-A-B-B-A-A-A-A-B-B-B)n.

===Statistical copolymers===
In statistical copolymers the sequence of monomer residues follows a statistical rule. If the probability of finding a given type monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is equal to the mole fraction of that monomer residue in the chain, then the polymer may be referred to as a truly random copolymer (structure 3).

Statistical copolymers are dictated by the reaction kinetics of the two chemically distinct monomer reactants, and are commonly referred to interchangeably as &quot;random&quot; in the polymer literature. As with other types of copolymers, random copolymers can have interesting and commercially desirable properties that blend those of the individual homopolymers. Examples of commercially relevant random copolymers include rubbers made from styrene-butadiene copolymers and resins from styrene-acrylic or methacrylic acid derivatives. Copolymerization is particularly useful in tuning the glass transition temperature, which is important in the operating conditions of polymers; it is assumed that each monomer occupies the same amount of free volume whether it is in a copolymer or homopolymer, so the glass transition temperature (Tg) falls between the values for each homopolymer and is dictated by the mole or mass fraction of each component.

A number of parameters are relevant in the composition of the polymer product; namely, one must consider the reactivity ratio of each component. Reactivity ratios describe whether the monomer reacts preferentially with a segment of the same type or of the other type. For example, a reactivity ratio that is less than one for component 1 indicates that this component reacts with the other type of monomer more readily. Given this information, which is available for a multitude of monomer combinations in the &quot;Wiley Database of Polymer Properties&quot;, the Mayo-Lewis equation can be used to predict the composition of the polymer product for all initial mole fractions of monomer. This equation is derived using the Markov model, which only considers the last segment added as affecting the kinetics of the next addition; the Penultimate Model considers the second-to-last segment as well, but is more complicated than is required for most systems. When both reactivity ratios are less than one, there is an azeotropic point in the Mayo-Lewis plot. At this point, the mole fraction of monomer equals the composition of the component in the polymer.

There are several ways to synthesize random copolymers. The most common synthesis method is free radical polymerization; this is especially useful when the desired properties rely on the composition of the copolymer rather than the molecular weight, since free radical polymerization produces relatively disperse polymer chains. Free radical polymerization is less expensive than other methods, and produces high-molecular weight polymer quickly. Several methods offer better control over dispersity. Anionic polymerization can be used to create random copolymers, but with several caveats: if carbanions of the two components do not have the same stability, only one of the species will add to the other. Additionally, anionic polymerization is expensive and requires very clean reaction conditions, and is therefore difficult to implement on a large scale. Less disperse random copolymers are also synthesized by ″living″ controlled radical polymerization methods, such as atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP), nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMP), or reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT). These methods are favored over anionic polymerization because they can be performed in conditions similar to free radical polymerization. The reactions require longer experimentation periods than free radical polymerization, but still achieve reasonable reaction rates.

===Stereoblock copolymers===

In stereoblock copolymers the blocks or units differ only in the tacticity of the monomers.

===Gradient copolymers===

In gradient copolymers the monomer composition changes gradually along the chain.

==Branched copolymers==

There are a variety of architectures possible for nonlinear copolymers. Beyond grafted and star polymers discussed below, other common types of branched copolymers include brush copolymers and comb copolymers.

=== Graft copolymers ===
Graft copolymers are a special type of branched copolymer wherein the side chains are structurally distinct from the main chain. Typically, the main chain is formed from one type of monomer (A) and branches are formed from another monomer (B), or the side-chains have constitutional or configurational features that differ from those in the main chain.

The individual chains of a graft copolymer may be homopolymers or copolymers. Note that different copolymer sequencing is sufficient to define a structural difference, thus an A-B diblock copolymer with A-B alternating copolymer side chains is properly called a graft copolymer.

For example, polystyrene chains may be grafted onto polybutadiene, a synthetic rubber which retains one reactive C=C double bond per repeat unit. The polybutadiene is dissolved in styrene, which is then subjected to free-radical polymerization. The growing chains can add across the double bonds of rubber molecules forming polystyrene branches. The graft copolymer is formed in a mixture with ungrafted polystyrene chains and rubber molecules.

As with block copolymers, the quasi-composite product has properties of both &quot;components.&quot; In the example cited, the rubbery chains absorb energy when the substance is hit, so it is much less brittle than ordinary polystyrene. The product is called high-impact polystyrene, or HIPS.

===Star copolymers===

Star copolymers have several polymer chains connected to a central core.

==Microphase separation==

Block copolymers can &quot;microphase separate&quot; to form periodic nanostructures, such as styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer. The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, transmission electron microscope or TEM was used to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse to create a regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains.

Microphase separation is a situation similar to that of oil and water. Oil and water are immiscible (i.e., they can phase separate). Due to the incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. Since the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically like water and oil. In &quot;microphase separation,&quot; the blocks form nanometer-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block, several morphologies can be obtained. In diblock copolymers, sufficiently different block lengths lead to nanometer-sized spheres of one block in a matrix of the second (e.g., PMMA in polystyrene). Using less different block lengths, a &quot;hexagonally packed cylinder&quot; geometry can be obtained. Blocks of similar length form layers (often called lamellae in the technical literature). Between the cylindrical and lamellar phase is the gyroid phase. The nanoscale structures created from block copolymers can potentially be used to create devices for computer memory, nanoscale-templating, and nanoscale separations. Block copolymers are sometimes used as a replacement for phospholipids in model lipid bilayers and liposomes for their superior stability and tunability.

Polymer scientists use thermodynamics to describe how the different blocks interact. The product of the degree of polymerization, &quot;n&quot;, and the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, formula_5, gives an indication of how incompatible the two blocks are and whether they will microphase separate. For example, a diblock copolymer of symmetric composition will microphase separate if the product formula_6 is greater than 10.5. If formula_6 is less than 10.5, the blocks will mix and microphase separation is not observed. The incompatibility between the blocks also affects the solution behavior of these copolymers and their adsorption behavior on various surfaces.

Block copolymers are able to self-assemble in selective solvents to form micelles among other structures.

In thin films, block copolymers are of great interest as masks in the lithographic patterning of semiconductor materials for applications in high density data storage. A key challenge is to minimise the feature size and much research is in progress on this.

== Characterization ==
Characterization techniques for copolymers are similar to those for other polymeric materials. These techniques can be used to determine the average molecular weight, molecular size, chemical composition, molecular homogeneity, and physiochemical properties of the material. However, given that copolymers are made of base polymer components with heterogeneous properties, this may require multiple characterization techniques to accurately characterize these copolymers.

Spectroscopic techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and UV spectroscopy, are often used to identify the molecular structure and chemical composition of copolymers. In particular, NMR can indicate the tacticity and configuration of polymeric chains while IR can identify functional groups attached to the copolymer.

Scattering techniques, such as static light scattering, dynamic light scattering, and small-angle neutron scattering, can determine the molecular size and weight of the synthesized copolymer. Static light scattering and dynamic light scattering use light to determine the average molecular weight and behavior of the copolymer in solution whereas small-angle neutron scattering uses neutrons to determine the molecular weight and chain length. Additionally, x-ray scattering techniques, such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can help determine the nanometer morphology and characteristic feature size of a microphase-separated block-copolymer or suspended micelles. 

Differential scanning calorimetry is a thermoanalytical technique used to determine the thermal events of the copolymer as a function of temperature. It can indicate when the copolymer is undergoing a phase transition, such as crystallization or melting, by measuring the heat flow required to maintain the material and a reference at a constantly increasing temperature.

Thermogravimetric analysis is another thermoanalytical technique used to access the thermal stability of the copolymer as a function of temperature. This provides information on any changes to the physicochemical properties, such as phase transitions, thermal decompositions, and redox reactions.

Size-exclusion chromatography can separate copolymers with different molecular weights based on their hydrodynamic volume. From there, the molecular weight can be determined by deriving the relationship from its hydrodynamic volume. Larger copolymers tend to elute first as they do not interact with the column as much. The collected material is commonly detected by light scattering methods, a refractometer, or a viscometer to determine the concentration of the eluted copolymer.  

== Applications ==

=== Block copolymers ===
A common application of block copolymers is to develop thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). Early commercial TPEs were developed from polyurethranes (TPUs), consisting of alternating soft segments and hard segments, and are used in automotive bumpers and snowmobile treads. Styrenic TPEs entered the market later, and are used in footwear, bitumen modification, thermoplastic blending, adhesives, and cable insulation and gaskets. Modifying the linkages between the blocks resulted in newer TPEs based on polyesters (TPES) and polyamides (TPAs), used in hose tubing, sport goods, and automotive components.

Amphiphilic block copolymers have the ability to form micelles and nanoparticles. Due to this property, amphiphilic block copolymers have garnered much attention in research on vehicles for drug delivery. Similarly, amphiphilic block copolymers can be used for the removal of organic contaminants from water either through micelle formation or film preparation.

=== Alternating copolymers ===
The styrene-maleic acid (SMA) alternating copolymer displays amphiphilicity depending on pH, allowing it to change conformations in different environments. Some conformations that SMA can take are random coil formation, compact globular formation, micelles, and nanodiscs. SMA has been used as a dispersing agent for dyes and inks, as drug delivery vehicles, and for membrane solubilization.

=== Copolymer engineering ===
Copolymerization is used to modify the properties of manufactured plastics to meet specific needs, for example to reduce crystallinity, modify glass transition temperature, control wetting properties or to improve solubility. It is a way of improving mechanical properties, in a technique known as rubber toughening. Elastomeric phases within a rigid matrix act as crack arrestors, and so increase the energy absorption when the material is impacted for example. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a common example.

<text>Bria is the capital of Haute-Kotto, one of the 14 prefectures of the Central African Republic. As of the 2003 census the town had a population of 35,204.

== Geography ==
Bria is located on the Kotto River.

== History == 
In 1930, a ginning factory was established in Bria by the Comouna cotton company.

=== Civil war ===

On 18 December 2012 Bria was captured by Séléka rebels. On 21 November 2016 an armed conflict broke out between the ethnicities Gula and Peuhl representing different armed groups resulting in death of 92 people, many more injured and 12000 refugees around the UN camp outside the city.

On 18 May 2017 heavy clashes erupted between Anti-balaka and ex-Seleka in Bria resulting in 26 deaths. On 21 June 2017 clashes between rival factions resulting in death of around 100 people. On 4 December 2017 Anti-balaka fighters led by Jean-Francis Diandi attacked international forces in Bria killing one Mauritanian peacekeeper. On 16 March 2018 Jean-Francis Diandi was arrested by peacekeepers. On 6 September 2018 Séléka rebels killed a number of people, most of them women.

On 25–6 January 2020 the MLCJ attacked Bria capturing more than 60% of the city after 24 hours of clashes with FPRC. On 28 January both groups signed ceasefire promising to withdraw fighters from parts of the town. On 22 March 2021 Bria was recaptured by government forces. One FPRC fighter was killed. On 2 April rebels launched attack on Bria which was repelled, two rebels and one soldier were killed.

Since 15 December 2021, Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group have arrested numerous people – mainly youths – inside the town, leading to reported human rights abuses. On 4 January, the Wagner Group gunned down young people in a massacre. At 5:00 P.M. mercenaries entered the local mosque and removed the corpses of their victims from the building.

== Climate ==
Bria has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with a lengthy though not intense wet season from mid-March to October and a relatively short and mostly rainless dry season from November to mid-March. Although the wet season is longer than the dry season, the dry season is sufficiently dry and the wet season insufficiently wet for tropical monsoon classification.

<text>Obo is the capital of Haut-Mbomou, one of the 20 prefectures of the Central African Republic. It is close to the African Pole of Inaccessibility.

== History ==
Obo was named after the local Zande chief Ogbo, with the spelling changed slightly in later years. Ogbo ruled the territory between the Mbokou and Kamou rivers. However, a conflict emerged when nearby Chief Gougbéré annexed much of Ogbo&#x27;s territory on the pretext that the inhabitants were from the same ethnic group as him. Ogbo petitioned Sultan Zémio, who was his first cousin once removed, to help, but the sultan did not intervene. Ogbo then asked French colonial captain Maurice Martin to mediate in 1910. Martin sided with Ogbo&#x27;s land claims, but said that any new settlements should be allowed to remain.

French military general Jean Baptiste Marchand passed through the area on his journey to find the source of the Nile. When he failed to find access to the river, the settlement became a cul-de-sac and he moved on in a different direction.

The Africa Inland Mission established a presence in the town in 1925 with the Linquist family, who came from Zemio. It was one of a number of evangelical missions among the Zande areas of Ubangi-Shari and the Belgian Congo.

On the night of 5 March 2008, Obo witnessed the first LRA&#x27;s attack. The group attacked the AIM neighborhood and abducted 73 residents.

===Central African Republic Civil War (2012-present)===
On 24 May 2013, 40-80 Arrow Boys militias from South Sudan attacked Obo. The attack was foiled and 29 militias were captured. They were put into prison of Obo Gendarmerie and seven of them died on the first day of their imprisonment.

On 9 May 2020 armed forces repelled an attack by the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic armed group on Obo, killing 11 militants. They repelled another attack on 18 May and another on 20 May, killing 12 militants. Between 26 and 27 July 2021, government forces repelled another attack on Obo by rebel groups affiliated with the Coalition of Patriots for Change. One Central African Armed Forces soldier was killed. With their town severely damaged by the attack, the residents of Obo organized a mass protest over MINUSCA&#x27;s ineffectiveness at preventing violence in the area.

Azande Ani Kpi Gbe attacked FACA military base in Obo on 5 April 2023 as a response to the arrest of its two members. The attack lasted for twenty minutes and the militia withdrew from the city. They claimed that the attack was a warning to the government. On 13 August 2023, Azande Ani Kpi Gbe kidnapped a Muslim resident in the town, thus resulting in a clash between FACA and the militia. One Azande milia was wounded and at night, several shops in the town were burned.

== Healthcare ==
The town hosts the only hospital in Haut Mbomou Prefecture, &quot;Hôpital Préfectoral de Obo&quot;. Besides that, Obo has one health center run by the &quot;Centre Médicale Evangélique de Obo&quot;, ex AIM.

== Media ==
The town has one radio which is Radio Zereda.

== Transport ==
The Poste Airport (now closed) is located near to the prefecture in town. The current airport was constructed in the early 1980s by the Africa Inland Mission - AIM.

<text>Mnichovo Hradiště (; ) is a town in Mladá Boleslav District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 9,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

*Mnichovo Hradiště (6,361)
*Dneboh (264)
*Dobrá Voda (56)

*Kruhy (74)
*Lhotice (149)
*Olšina (194)
*Podolí (116)
*Sychrov (125)
*Veselá (667)
==Etymology==
The town was initially named Hradiště (i.e. &quot;gord&quot;), after the monastery of the monks who founded the town. Later the town was called Hradiště nad Jizerou and Hradiště Mnichové. From the 19th century, the town is called Mnichovo Hradiště (&quot;monk&#x27;s gord&quot;).

==Geography==
Mnichovo Hradiště is located about north of Mladá Boleslav and south of Liberec. It lies in the Jičín Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level. The town is situated on the left bank of the Jizera River, which forms the western municipal border. The streams Veselka and Nedbalka, tributaries of the Jizera, flow through the town.

==History==

The first written mention of Hradiště is from 1279. It was founded by monks from the nearby Cistercian monastery in Klášter Hradiště nad Jizerou. The monastery owned the town until 1420, when both the monastery and the town were burned down by the Orebites. After the Hussite Wars, properties of the monastery were divided among various noble families. Since then, the owners of Hradiště have often changed. The owners included Jan Čapek of Sány, Mikuláš Berka of Dubá, Old Town of Prague and Jan of Vartenberk.

From the end of the 16th century, the town was owned by the Budovec of Budov family. Václav Budovec of Budov was executed in 1621. After his death, the Hradiště estate was acquired by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who soon gave it to his relative Maxmilián of Waldstein. At the end of the 17th century, Hradiště became the centre of an extensive estate. In the 18th century, the town developed rapidly. New houses and representative buildings were built, culture and education were supported and a Jewish community was established. The Waldstein family owned the estate until 1945.

Until 1918 the town was part of Austria-Hungary and was the centre of a district, which was one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
In 2010, a factory producing the Czech cola-based drink Kofola opened in Mnichovo Hradiště.

==Transport==
The D10 motorway from Prague to Turnov runs next to the town.

Mnichovo Hradiště is located on the railway line Prague–Turnov.

==Sights==
The main landmark of the town is Mnichovo Hradiště Castle. The original Gothic fortress was rebuilt into a Renaissance residence in 1606 by Václav Budovec of Budov. In 1945, it was confiscated by the state. Today the castle is still owned by the state and is open to the public. It is protected as a national cultural monument.

The castle is connected to the Baroque complex of the Capuchin monastery from the 1690s, founded by the Waldsteins. The complex include the Church of the Holy Three Kings, the convent and the burial chapel of the Waldsteins. The remains of Albrecht von Wallenstein were moved from Jičín to the chapel in 1723.

The Church of Saint James the Great is among the most valuable buildings of the town. It was built in the Baroque style in 1726–1727.

<text>Sibut (), formerly Fort Sibut () is the capital of Kémo, one of the 16 prefectures of the Central African Republic. An important transport hub, it is situated north of the capital Bangui and is known for its market.

Sibut is located at the Northern end of the paved road coming from the capital, Bangui. At Sibut, two major provincial roads split, one going North to Kaga Bandoro, and the other east towards Bomimi, a thriving agricultural village of 450 people, from Sibut.

== History==
The settlement was originally named Krébédjé after the local Dekpa chief of the same name. The French arrived in 1895 and Krébédjé, and they officially recognised him as chief the next year. 

The town was renamed Fort Sibut in 1900 after Medical Major Adolphe Pierre Sibut, a deceased friend of colonial official Émile Gentil.

Sibut sits on the banks of the Kémo, a minor tributary of the Ubangi River about long. Formerly an important route of supply and communication between Fort de Possel on the Ubangi and the French settlements around Lake Chad, the river is now non-navigable even with small watercraft.

In 1952, American Baptist missionary Margery Benedict established a medical clinic and dispensary at Fort Sibut. In 1982, President Andre Kolingba traveled to Sibut to award her the Order of Gratitude for 30 years of service.

In 1980, Sibut was electrified.

The present city has one high school which also serves as a landing strip, and a market. Local food in street cafes include gozo (cassava) and peanut spinach sauce, along with various species of bushmeat. Local drink includes palm wine and 33 beer. The Peace Corps had volunteers located in Sibut until the coup d&#x27;état of 1996.

On 29 December 2012 the city was captured by Seleka rebels. On 2 February 2014 Anti-balaka took control of the city following Seleka withdrawal. In May 2018 Central African Armed Forces were redeployed in the city with help of Russian instructors.

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw).

<text>Mbaïki (also spelt Mbaki or M&#x27;Baiki) is the capital of Lobaye, one of the 14 prefectures of the Central African Republic. It is situated in the southwest of the country, 107 km from the capital Bangui. Lobaye people and Pygmy people live in the area. There is also a waterfall near the town.

== History ==
Mbaïki was ceded by France to Germany under the terms of the 1911 Morocco-Congo Treaty, becoming part of the German colony of Neukamerun until it was reconquered by the French during World War I. Mbaiki received electricity in 1969. In 1995, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mbaïki was established in the city.

As a consequence of the Central African Republic conflict (2012–present), its previously large Muslim population has been emptied from the town.

== Economy ==
The economy is based on the coffee and timber industries.

<doc id="768855" wikidata="Q3405409" url="?curid=768855" title="World Fantasy Award—Novella">
<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction published in English during the previous calendar year. The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Novella is given each year for fantasy stories published in English. A work of fiction is eligible for the category if it is between 10,000 and 40,000 words in length; awards are also given out for longer pieces in the Novel category and shorter lengths in the Short Fiction category. The Novella category has been awarded annually since 1982, though between 1975—when the World Fantasy Awards were instated—and 1982 the short fiction category covered works of up to 40,000 words. In 2016, the name of the category was changed from Best Novella to Long Fiction, before reverting to Novella in 2018.

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of H. P. Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 43 nomination years, 158 authors have had works nominated; 42 of them have won, including ties and co-authors. Only five authors have won more than once: Elizabeth Hand, with three wins out of nine nominations; Richard Bowes, with two wins out of three nominations; K. J. Parker, who also won twice out of three nominations; Ellen Klages, with two wins out of two nominations; and Kij Johnson, also with two wins out of two nominations. Of authors who have won at least once, Hand has the most nominations, followed by George R. R. Martin at five and Ursula K. Le Guin at four. Lucius Shepard has the most nominations without winning and the most overall at ten; he is followed by Kim Newman, who has six nominations without winning.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="768856" wikidata="Q48890" url="?curid=768856" title="College basketball">
<text>College basketball is basketball that is played by teams of amateur student-athletes at universities and colleges. In the United States, colleges and universities are governed by collegiate athletic bodies, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Each of these various organizations is subdivided into one to three divisions, based on the number and level of scholarships that may be provided to the athletes. Teams with more talent tend to win over teams with less talent.

Each organization has different conferences to divide the teams into groups. Traditionally, the location of a school has been a significant factor in determining conference affiliation. The bulk of the games on a team&#x27;s schedule during the season are against fellow conference members. Therefore, geographic proximity of conference members allows local rivalries to develop and minimizes travel costs. Further, televised road games played in the same time zone as that of the visiting team&#x27;s fans tend to draw larger audiences, which enhances the value of the media rights.

Institutional compatibility is another factor that may lead schools to band together in the same conference. For instance, , all full members of the West Coast Conference are Christian colleges and universities located in the Pacific Time Zone. The Ivy League comprises institutions with similar, high academic standards that prefer to schedule nearly all their conference basketball games on Fridays and Saturdays, except during breaks between semesters, to minimize the disruption caused to the studies of the student-athletes.

Since the 1990s, geographic proximity has gradually become a less important factor in determining membership in NCAA Division I conferences. For instance, the Big Ten Conference was originally composed of institutions in the Midwest. It has since expanded to include members in New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania. On July 1, 2024, the Big Ten will admit four new members, all of which are located in the Pacific Time Zone. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) had a footprint that extended from Maryland to Florida, with all members located in states on the Atlantic Coast in the 1990s. It has since expanded to include members in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Indiana. In July and August 2024, the ACC admitted two new members located in California and one new member located in Texas.

The shifts in conference membership are primarily driven by schools seeking lucrative media rights deals and appropriately competitive playing partners for their football programs. In most cases, schools house as many of their sports in the same primary conference as possible. So, the football-driven changes in affiliation lead to changes in the composition of basketball conferences. When a conference loses a member to another conference, it will often try to recruit a replacement from a third conference. This triggers a domino effect, and smaller, less stable conferences struggle to remain large enough to compete at the same level as they had in the past. The smallest Division I conferences sometimes recruit Division II teams and help those institutions transition to Division I, in order to replace teams they have lost. Sometimes, this is done pre-emptively to make the conference larger and protect it against the possible loss of some of its teams.

Teams are not required to join conferences and may play as independents instead. Chicago State is the most recent independent basketball team in Division I of the NCAA, having competed as an independent for two seasons before joining the Northeast Conference in 2024. Finding opponents can be problematic for an independent team, particularly during the latter part of the season, when most other teams are regularly playing conference opponents. In addition, each conference gets an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Independent teams do not have access to such a pathway and must be selected at-large in order to participate in the tournament. Chicago State joined the Northeast Conference on July 1, 2024, leaving no independent teams in NCAA Division I.

Most games between conference opponents take place in the latter part of the season. While there are various rankings of teams throughout the entire NCAA, there are also conference standings based on the results of games against conference opponents. Once the conference schedule is complete, the conference stages a tournament that includes some or all of its teams. The regular-season conference standings are generally used to determine qualification for and seeding in the conference tournament. The Western Athletic Conference is an exception. It uses the regular-season conference standings to determine qualification for its tournament, but seeding is based on a formulaic ranking of the strength of the qualifiers, including their performances against non-conference opponents. In most cases, the winner of the conference tournament receives an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. However, teams that are in transition from Division II are not eligible for the NCAA tournament. Therefore, if such a team wins a conference tournament, the conference will use an alternate method to select the team to receive its automatic bid. Some conferences allow transitioning teams to participate in their conference tournaments; others do not allow this.

==History==
The history of basketball can be traced back to a YMCA International Training School, known today as Springfield College, located in Springfield, Massachusetts. The sport was created by a physical education teacher named James Naismith, who in the winter of 1891 was given the task of creating a game that would keep track athletes in shape and that would prevent them from getting hurt. The date of the first formal basketball game played at the Springfield YMCA Training School under Naismith&#x27;s rules is generally given as December 21, 1891. Along with this during the history and rise of the college game of basketball many issues arose. These issues were known as &quot;civil wars&quot; in college basketball, according to Kurt Edward Kemper. At first all colleges were considered as equal competitors because there were no divisions or conferences which caused smaller schools to protest against this. Eventually they created the NIT program, but this was only for the larger colleges and universities, so they then in 1937 had to create the NAIB for smaller colleges. Basketball began to be played at some college campuses by 1893.

===Collegiate firsts===
The first known college to field a basketball team against an outside opponent was Vanderbilt University, which played against the local YMCA in Nashville, Tennessee, on February 7, 1893, where Vanderbilt won 9–6. The second recorded instance of an organized college basketball game was Geneva College&#x27;s game against New Brighton YMCA on April 8, 1893, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, which Geneva won 3–0.

The first recorded game between two college teams occurred on November 22, 1894, when the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now known as Drexel University) faced Temple College (now known as Temple University). Drexel won the game, which was played under rules allowing nine players per side, among many other variations from modern basketball, 26–1. The first intercollegiate match using the modern rule of five players per side is often credited as a game between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa, on January 18, 1896. The Chicago team won the game 15-12, under the coaching of Amos Alonzo Stagg, who had learned the game from James Naismith at Springfield YMCA. However, some sources state the first &quot;true&quot; five-on-five intercollegiate match was a game in 1897 between Yale and Penn, because although the Iowa team that played Chicago in 1896 was composed of University of Iowa students, it reportedly did not officially represent the university, rather it was organized through a YMCA. By 1900, the game of basketball had spread to colleges across the country.

===Tournaments===
The Amateur Athletic Union&#x27;s annual U.S. national championship tournament (first played in 1898) often featured collegiate teams playing against non-college teams. Four colleges won the AAU tournament championship: Utah (1916), NYU (1920), Butler (1924) and Washburn (1925). College teams were also runners-up in 1915, 1917, 1920, 1921, 1932 and 1934.

The first known tournament featuring exclusively college teams was the 1904 Summer Olympics, where basketball was a demonstration sport, and a collegiate championship tournament was held. The Olympic title was won by Hiram College. In March 1908, a two-game &quot;championship series&quot; was organized between the University of Chicago and Penn, with games played in Philadelphia and Bartlett, Illinois. Chicago swept both games to win the series.

In March 1922, the 1922 National Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament was held in Indianapolis – the first stand-alone post-season tournament exclusively for college teams. The champions of six major conferences participated: Pacific Coast Conference, Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, Western Pennsylvania League, Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association and Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The Western Conference and Eastern Intercollegiate League declined invitations to participate. Wabash College won the 1922 tournament.

The first organization to tout a regularly occurring national collegiate championship was the NAIA in 1937, although it was quickly surpassed in prestige by the National Invitation Tournament, or NIT, which brought six teams to New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in the spring of 1938. Temple defeated Colorado in the first NIT tournament championship game, 60–36.

====NCAA tournament====
In 1939, another national tournament was implemented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The location of the NCAA tournament varied from year to year, and it soon used multiple locations each year, so more fans could see games without traveling to New York. Although the NIT was created earlier and was more prestigious than the NCAA for many years, it ultimately lost popularity and status to the NCAA Tournament. In 1950, following a double win by the 1949–50 CCNY Beavers men&#x27;s basketball team (when the NIT comprised 12 and the NCAA 8 teams), the NCAA ruled that no team could compete in both tournaments, and effectively indicated that a team eligible for the NCAA tournament should play in it. Not long afterward, assisted by the 1951 scandals based in New York City, the NCAA tournament had become more prestigious than before, with conference champions and the majority of top-ranked teams competing there. The NCAA tournament eventually overtook the NIT by 1960. Through the 1960s and 1970s, with UCLA leading the way as winner of ten NCAA Tournament championships, a shift in power to teams from the west amplified the shift of attention away from the New York City-based NIT. When the NCAA tournament expanded its field of teams from 25 to 32 in 1975, to 48 in 1980, to 64 in 1985, and to 68 teams in 2011, interest in the NCAA tournament increased again and again, as it comprised more and more teams, soon including all of the strongest ones. (Expansion also improved the distribution of playing locations, which number roughly one-third the number of teams in the field.)

In 2011, the NCAA field expanded to 68 teams and the last 8 teams playing for four spots making the field into 64, which is called the first round and so on. The former first round is called the second round, the second round is called the third round, and the Sweet Sixteen is the same, but it is technically the fourth round in the current format, etc.

In 2016, the field did not expand, but the round numbers changed again. The first four games containing the last 8 teams is now referred to as the first four. Consequently, the first round does not start until the first four games are out of the way and the field is narrowed to 64 teams. So after the first four games the first round starts instead of that being the second round. The Second is now when there are 32 teams left, the sweet sixteen is the third round, and so on.

In 2020, for the first time in the NCAA&#x27;s history, the tournament had to be canceled due to fears of the COVID-19 pandemic. This move was done largely out of fear of the virus spreading to players and watchers, with prior attempts to limit the spread without canceling by first choosing to limit attendees, and then canceling the tournament in its entirety.

The cancellation of the tournament, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a lot of uncertainty for the coaches, players, and NCAA as a whole. Many people were very disappointed and had wished it was just delayed, rather than completely being cancelled. Unfortunately, this pandemic really effected the seniors on the teams, considering their last season just got abruptly taken from them. The NCAA did consider granting waivers to the student athletes who participated in winter sports (including basketball) so that they could regain eligibility for the 2021 season. However, many of the seniors were projected to be picked in the NBA draft, so this led to the difficult decision of playing one more year with their college teammates or moving on to the big stage.

In 2021, the tournament was able to take place, and the teams were so ready to be back. Baylor was the Men&#x27;s 2021 NCAA Champions. In 2022, Kansas won the tournament, defeating North Carolina in the championship. For the women&#x27;s competition, the 2021 champions were Stanford, who defeated Arizona in a very close game. In 2022, the women&#x27;s NCAA champions was South Carolina, defeating UConn in the championship. LSU&#x27;s women and UConn&#x27;s men were the 2023 national champions, defeating Iowa and San Diego State, respectively, in the championship games.

====National Invitation Tournament (NIT)====

===Racial integration===
Racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the regional agenda in the 1950s and 1960s. These issues included inequality, racism, and the alumni demand for the top players needed to win high-profile games. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) took the lead. &quot;College basketball data allow for direct comparisons of the racial differences in the marginal revenues generated by players&quot; (Brown and Jewell 1995). First they started to schedule integrated teams from the North. The wake-up call came in 1966 when Don Haskins&#x27;s Texas Western College team with five black starters defeated the all-white University of Kentucky team to win the NCAA national basketball championship. This happened at a time when there weren&#x27;t any black varsity basketball players in either the Southeastern Conference or the Southwest Conference. Finally ACC schools—typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups—integrated their teams. With an alumni base that dominated local and state politics, society and business, the ACC flagship schools were successful in their endeavor—as Pamela Grundy argues, they had learned how to win:
: The widespread admiration that athletic ability inspired would help transform athletic fields from grounds of symbolic play to forces for social change, places where a wide range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the assumptions that cast them as unworthy of full participation in U.S. society. While athletic successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotype—black athletes would continue to confront racial slurs...[minority star players demonstrated] the discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every arena of national life.

===Suspension of Yale University===

In 1969, for the first time, the NCAA Council did not permit participation by American college basketball players in the Maccabiah Games. The Maccabiah Games are an international multi-sport event held in Israel, open to all Jewish athletes from around the world, and to all Israeli citizens regardless of their religion. In 1961 the Games were declared a &quot;Regional Sports Event&quot; by, and under the auspices and supervision of, the International Olympic Committee. The NCAA failed to permit such participation by American college basketball players despite the fact that it had permitted such participation in the past and continued to permit participation by American college athletes in other Maccabiah Games sports, such as swimming, track, fencing, and soccer.

Basketball was different, however. In that the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) – with which the NCAA was locked in a bitter power struggle – was for the first time organizing the Team USA basketball team for the Maccabiah Games, a role that had formerly been held by the NCAA. NCAA executive director Walter Byers, whom the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; described as &quot;power-mad&quot; and others described as a &quot;petty tyrant&quot;, headed the NCAA and was involved in the decision. The Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), an affiliate of the NCAA, followed the NCAA&#x27;s orders on sanctions. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the failure of the NCAA to permit such participation in Maccabiah basketball was believed &quot;to stem from the N.C.A.A.&#x27;s feud with the Amateur Athletic Union over control of [amateur] athletes.&quot; Author Leonard Shecter called the NCAA decision a &quot;classic example of NCAA stupidity&quot;.

In 1969—against the wishes of the NCAA—Yale University Jewish center Jack Langer played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He did so with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster, the university said it would not stop Langer from &quot;what we feel is a matter of religious freedom,&quot; and all Ivy League presidents fully endorsed Yale&#x27;s stand. Thereafter, Yale played Langer in basketball games the following season. A special assistant to the President of Yale, Henry Chauncey Jr., said: &quot;There is no question that Jack Langer will continue to play basketball. We don&#x27;t care what they do - Jack Langer will play when the coach wants to use him.&quot; On January 15, 1970, the NCAA Council placed Yale University on two‐year &quot;full athletic probation&quot; in all sports. It thereby restricted Yale teams and athletes (not just basketball players) for two years from competing in NCAA tournaments, championships and other postseason competitions, and from receiving any monies for televised events. The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.

The Presidents of the other seven Ivy League schools issued a statement condemning the NCAA&#x27;s actions 
in regard to the &quot;Langer Case&quot;. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; called the probation &quot;not only unjust, but intolerable&quot;, and urged the Ivy League to withdraw from the NCAA. Harvard track and field captain Ed Nosal and two other Harvard athletes, sympathetic to Langer and Yale and disdainful of the absurdity of the NCAA rule, protested at the 1970 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships by standing on the awards stand wearing blue Yale jerseys. In February 1970, Representative Robert N. Giaimo (D-Connecticut) said in the U.S. Congress:

The Yale case, involving basketball player Jack Langer, is tragic. It shows that the NCAA is willing to use any weapon in its continuing power struggle with the Amateur Athletic Union. It shows that the NCAA does not care if it hurts member institutions or individual athletes in the process. It shows once again that the NCAA is ... under the control of a stubborn, dictatorial hierarchy that does not hesitate to use athletes and schools alike as mere pawns in a game of power politics.

===Original rules===
The original rules for basketball were very different from today&#x27;s modern rules of the sport, including the use of eight players per side. James Naismith established 13 original rules: 
#The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
#The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands, but never with the fist.
#A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, with allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed.
#The ball must be held by the hands. The arms or body must not be used for holding it.
#No shouldering, holding, pushing, striking, or tripping in any way of an opponent is allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul; the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game. No substitution shall be allowed.
#A foul will be called when a player is seen striking at the ball with the fist, or when violations of rules 3 and 4 and such as described in rule 5 have been made.
#If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count as a goal for the opponents (&quot;consecutive&quot; means without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).
#A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.
#When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person touching it. In case of dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.
#The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to rule 5.
#The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals, with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
#The time shall be two fifteen-minute halves, with five minutes rest between.
#The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner.

===History of NCAA basketball rule changes===

The following is a list of some of the major NCAA Basketball rule changes with the year they went into effect.

=== One-and-done and suspension rule ===
The one-and-done rule has been a part of college basketball since 2006, the first NBA draft it affected. The rule was created by NBA Commissioner, David Stern, which changed the draft age from 18 years old to 19 years old. This change meant players could not be drafted into the NBA straight out of high school. Instead, however, they usually went to a college to play only one season before entering the following NBA draft when they were eligible, hence the name one-and-done. The first player to be drafted during this &quot;one-and-done era&quot; was Tyrus Thomas, a forward out of Louisiana State, who was drafted fourth overall in 2006.Along with the one and done rule, they also added the rule of players not being allowed to participate in any professional or NBA camps or activities until they are officially done with college basketball, and if any one is to break this rule it results in a one game suspension.

==Conferences==

===NCAA Division I===

In 2024–25, a total of 364 schools (including those transitioning from a lower NCAA division to Division I) will play men&#x27;s basketball in 31 Division I basketball conferences. All of these schools also sponsor women&#x27;s basketball except The Citadel and VMI, two military colleges that were all-male until the 1990s and remain overwhelmingly male today.

The conferences for 2024–25 are
*America East Conference

Notes
In the early decades of college basketball, and well into the 1970s, many schools played as independents, with no conference membership. However, the rise of televised college sports in the 1980s led to the formation of many new conferences and the expansion of previously existing conferences. There are currently no Division I independent schools. The most recent D-I independent was Chicago State, which joined the Northeast Conference for the 2024–25 season.

===NCAA Division II===

As of the 2023–24 college basketball season, there are 23 Division II basketball conferences:
*California Collegiate Athletic Association
*Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference
*Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association
*Conference Carolinas
*East Coast Conference
*Great American Conference
*Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
*Great Lakes Valley Conference
*Great Midwest Athletic Conference
*Great Northwest Athletic Conference
*Gulf South Conference
*Lone Star Conference
*Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association
*Mountain East Conference
*Northeast-10 Conference
*Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference
*Pacific West Conference
*Peach Belt Conference
*Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference
*Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference
*South Atlantic Conference
*Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
*Sunshine State Conference
There are currently four independent Division II schools without conference affiliations for the 2024–25 season: Salem, UPR-Rio Piedras, UPR-Mayaguez, and UPR-Bayamon; the latter three also maintain dual membership in both the Liga Atlética Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico as well as NCAA Division II.

The most recent change in the list of Division II conferences is the demise of the Heartland Conference, which disbanded at the end of the 2018–19 school year. In 2017, eight of its nine members announced a mass exodus to the Lone Star Conference (LSC) effective in 2019. The remaining member would soon announce that it would become a de facto member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA), and one of the original eight schools to announce a move to the LSC later changed course and chose to become a de facto MIAA member as well.

===NCAA Division III===

*Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference

Since its introduction in 1973, Division III has always had the lowest share of Black coaches. As of 2015, less than 10% of the coaches in Division III were black (compared to around 20% in Division II and 25% in Division I).

Notes
The most recent changes to the roster of D-III conferences came in 2023. The New England Collegiate Conference, which had been decimated earlier in the decade by the closure of several of its member schools and conference realignment in Division III, disbanded as an all-sports conference. (It remains in operation for men&#x27;s volleyball and the non-NCAA esports.) The Colonial States Athletic Conference and United East Conference merged after the 2022–23 season under the United East banner. The last previous change came in 2020, when the American Collegiate Athletic Association merged into the Capital Athletic Conference, with the merged entity soon renaming itself the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference.

===NAIA===

From 1992 to 2020, the NAIA operated separate Division I and Division II men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball championships; the distinction between the two divisions was that D-I schools awarded basketball scholarships while D-II schools chose not to. Basketball divisions were abolished after the 2019–20 season, and single men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championships have been held since then.

==Relationship to professional basketball==
In past decades, the NBA held to tradition and drafted players who had graduated from college. This was a mutually beneficial relationship for the NBA and colleges—the colleges held onto players who would otherwise go professional, and the NBA did not have to fund a minor league. As the college game became commercialized, though, it became increasingly difficult for &quot;student athletes&quot; to be students. A growing number of poor, but highly talented, teenage basketball players found the system exploitative—they brought in funds to schools where they played without income.

The American Basketball Association began to employ players who had not yet graduated from college. After a season of junior college, a season at the University of Detroit, and an Olympic gold medal, Spencer Haywood played the 1969–70 season with the ABA&#x27;s Denver Rockets. He signed with the NBA&#x27;s Seattle SuperSonics in 1970, before his college class graduation, defying NBA rules. Haywood pleaded that, as his family&#x27;s sole wage earner, he should be allowed to earn a living in the NBA or else his family would face destitution. The ensuing legal battle went to the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled in 1971 that the NBA does not have the same antitrust exemption enjoyed by Major League Baseball. Thereafter, collegiate players demonstrating economic hardship were allowed early entry into the NBA draft. The hardship requirement was eliminated in 1976.

In 1974, Moses Malone joined the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (which became part of the NBA after the ABA–NBA merger in 1976) straight out of high school and went on to a Hall of Fame career. The past 30 years had displayed a remarkable change in the college game. The best international players routinely skipped college entirely, many American stars passed up on college (Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard, Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, and LeBron James) or only played one year (Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, and John Wall), and only a dozen or so college graduates were among the 60 players selected in the annual NBA draft. Fewer high schoolers were progressing directly to the NBA without at least one year of college basketball beginning in 2006; citing maturity concerns after several incidents involving young players, the labor agreement between players and owners now specifies that players must turn 19 years of age during the calendar year of the draft to be eligible. Additionally, U.S. players must be at least one year removed from their high school graduation.

The pervasiveness of college basketball throughout the nation, the large population of graduates from &quot;major conference&quot; universities, and the NCAA&#x27;s marketing of &quot;March Madness&quot; (officially the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship), have kept the college game alive and well. Some commentators have argued that the higher turnover of players has increased the importance of good coaches. Many teams have been highly successful, for instance, by emphasizing personality in their recruiting efforts, with the goal of creating a cohesive group that, while lacking stars, plays together for all four years and thus develops a higher level of sophistication than less stable teams could achieve.

College basketball remains more popular than the NBA in some regions of the United States, such as in North Carolina and the Midwest (where traditionally strong programs at Louisville, Kansas,and Indiana are found).

==Distinctions with NBA and WNBA play==
The NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Rules Committee, consisting of coaches from all three divisions of the NCAA, sets the rules for college men&#x27;s basketball play. A parallel committee sets rules for college women&#x27;s play. Although many of the NBA and WNBA rules apply in NCAA play, there are differences that make NCAA play unique.

As of the 2021–22 season, NCAA men&#x27;s games are divided into two halves, each 20 minutes long; NBA games are played in four quarters of 12 minutes each; and WNBA and NCAA women&#x27;s games are played in 10-minute quarters. The NCAA shot clock gives teams of both sexes 30 seconds to shoot, while the shot clock used in both the NBA and WNBA gives teams 24 seconds. Also, NCAA teams are allowed 10 seconds to move the ball past the halfcourt line (with this rule only having been added to the women&#x27;s college game in the 2013–14 season), while NBA and WNBA rules allow only 8 seconds. However, like the NBA and WNBA (and high school basketball), during the last minute of each period, the game clock keeps time remaining in the period measured in tenths of a second, rather than full seconds.

Prior to the 2015–16 season, NCAA men&#x27;s basketball used a 35-second shot clock, while NCAA women&#x27;s basketball was played with the same 20-minute halves as the men&#x27;s game.

Though the height of the basket, the foul line&#x27;s distance from the backboard, and the court dimensions are the same, the distance between the three-point line and the backboard is different. The NBA three-point line measures at the top of the circle, or 22 feet (6.7 m) in the corners or baseline. On the NCAA court, the three-point line had been a constant , but the NCAA Rules Committee voted in May 2007 to extend it a foot more to , which became effective beginning the 2008–09 season for men and the 2011–12 season for women. Effective in 2019–20, the NCAA adopted the current FIBA three-point arc of at the top of the circle and at the corners and baseline for Division I men&#x27;s play, with Divisions II and III following in 2020–21. The previous college men&#x27;s arc will remain in use for women&#x27;s play for the time being, but the FIBA arc was to be used on an experimental basis in the 2020 Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament and Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational (which ultimately were not held). The WNBA&#x27;s three-point line was , which FIBA used before it extended its three-point arc to at the top of the circle and at the corners and baseline. The NCAA lane measures in width, while the NBA and WNBA lane is ; the FIBA lane is marginally wider than the NBA/WNBA lane at exactly .

NCAA players are allowed five personal fouls before fouling out, as opposed to their NBA counterparts, who are allowed six. This maintains the same ratio of minutes of play per foul allowed, eight. However, the WNBA allows players six personal fouls despite playing the same number of minutes as the NCAA. The number of team fouls allotted is also different. In all three competitions, team fouls can be categorized as shooting or non-shooting. A shooting foul occurs when a player gets fouled in the act of shooting (while airborne), giving him the chance to shoot free throws. A common foul (non-shooting foul) consists of all other fouls, including making contact with the opposing player while &quot;reaching in&quot; to steal the ball.

A team may make a certain number of non-shooting fouls per period before the opposing team is awarded free throws. In the NBA, WNBA, and (since 2015–16) NCAA women&#x27;s basketball, the fifth team foul in a quarter places the team in penalty. For every foul starting with the fifth, whether shooting or non-shooting, the opposing team receives two free throws. In addition, if an NBA or WNBA team has not entered the penalty in the last two minutes of a period, its team foul count is reset; the second team foul in the last two minutes triggers the penalty. In the NCAA men&#x27;s game, the penalty begins with the seventh team foul in a half. However, the fouled player must make the first free throw in order to get the second. This is called a &quot;one-and-one&quot; or &quot;one and the bonus&quot; situation. On the tenth team foul, the &quot;double bonus&quot; situation comes into play, meaning that every subsequent team foul results in two free throws for the opposing team. No free throws are shot at either level for a player control foul, which is an offensive foul (usually a charge). Unlike NBA/WNBA rules, the team foul count does not reset in the last two minutes of a half (men&#x27;s) or quarter (women&#x27;s). Overtime periods are considered an extension of the second half under NCAA men&#x27;s rules and the fourth quarter under NCAA women&#x27;s rules, but not under NBA/WNBA rules; in those leagues, the fourth team foul in any overtime period, or the second in the last two minutes, triggers the penalty.

When a dispute over ball possession arises, the jump ball is used in the NBA and WNBA. In the NCAA, once the first possession has been established from the opening tip, no further jump balls occur except to begin an overtime period. Since 1981, a possession arrow on the scorer&#x27;s table has dictated which team should possess the ball, with the arrow switching directions after each use.

NCAA teams can call a timeout after they made a basket (Indiana scores a 3-point field goal and calls a timeout); in the NBA and WNBA, only the opposing team can call a timeout after a basket is made. From the 2015–16 season through 2018–19, NCAA men&#x27;s coaches were banned from calling timeouts from the bench while the ball is live at any time in the game; from 2019 to 2020, they are again allowed to call such timeouts, but only during the last 2 minutes of any period (half or overtime). Players have not been subject to this restriction.

In addition, the NBA limits what types of defense a team can play, primarily in an effort to prevent coaches from slowing down the pace of the game by using zone defenses. Zone defense is permitted in the NBA and WNBA; however, players cannot stand in the lane for more than three seconds if they are not guarding anyone. In NCAA basketball, no such restriction exists, and coaches are free to design a variety of defensive techniques.

In college basketball, it is required by rule that the home team wears their white or light-colored jerseys while the visiting team wears their darker jersey color. The NBA, like most other professional sports leagues, lets the home team decide which uniform to wear, but with a few exceptions the home team has continued the tradition of the college game and wears white (or in the case of the Los Angeles Lakers for non-Sunday home games, gold) at home. Since the 2017–18 season, the NBA only requires that road teams wear colors that contrast sufficiently with the home team&#x27;s choice, meaning that &quot;color on color&quot; games are now possible. This is for regular season play only; home teams always wear white during the playoffs. The WNBA, however, follows the college rule for all games.

The NBA introduced a new dress code rule in 2005. Now players are required to wear business casual attire whenever they are engaged in team or league business. This includes a long or short-sleeved dress shirt (collared or turtleneck), and/or a sweater; dress slacks, khaki pants, or dress jeans, and appropriate shoes and socks, including dress shoes, dress boots, or other presentable shoes, but not including sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, or work boots. The WNBA has a similar dress code, adjusted for standard women&#x27;s attire. NCAA rules have no set dress code rule, leaving it up to individual teams or conferences.

The organizations also have different rules for jersey numbers. While the NBA and WNBA allow players to wear any number from 0 to 99, including 00, so long as it is available, the NCAA disallows any jersey number with a 6, 7, 8, or 9 in it. This is done to allow the referee to report fouls using hand signals with one hand, as each hand has only five fingers. High school basketball, whose rules are set by the National Federation of State High School Associations, also follows the NCAA&#x27;s convention on jersey numbering.

==Other divisions==
While less commercialized than Division I, Division II and Division III are both highly successful college basketball organizations. Women&#x27;s Division I is often televised, but to smaller audiences than Men&#x27;s Division I. Generally, small colleges join Division II, while colleges of all sizes that choose not to offer athletic scholarships join Division III. Games other than NCAA D-I are rarely televised by national media, although CBS televises the Championship Final of NCAA Division II, while CBS College Sports Network televises the semifinals as well as the Division III Final.
The NAIA also sponsors men and women&#x27;s college-level basketball. The NAIA Men&#x27;s Basketball National Championship has been held annually since 1937 (with the exception of 1944 and 2020), when it was established by James Naismith to crown a national champion for smaller colleges and universities. Unlike the NCAA Tournament, the NAIA Tournament features only 32 teams, and the entire tournament is contested in one week instead of three weekends. Since 2002 the NAIA National Tournament has been played in Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. (in 1994–2001 it was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and 1937–1999 it was held at Municipal then Kemper Arena in Kansas City). Media coverage has sporadically been provided by CBS, the Victory Sports Network, and various lesser-known media.
From 1992 to 2020, the NAIA sponsored a Division II championship, similar to the NCAA Division I and II. There is also an NAIA Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship, which was also split into Divisions I and II through the 2019–20 season. From 2020 to 2021, the NAIA will adopt a single-division format for basketball, with the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments featuring 64 teams each. In both tournaments, the first two rounds will be held at 16 regional sites, with only the winner at each site advancing to the final tournament site.

The only school to have won national titles in both the NAIA and NCAA Division I is Louisville; the Cardinals have also won the NIT title. Southern Illinois has won NAIA and NIT titles. Central Missouri and Fort Hays State have won NAIA and NCAA Division II national titles. Indiana State has won an NAIA title and finished as the National Runner-Up in the NAIA (twice), in NCAA Division II (once) and NCAA Division I (once).

<text>Anfield is a suburb of Liverpool, England, in the Liverpool City Council ward of Anfield. Historically in Lancashire, it is part of the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency. The population of the Liverpool Ward at the time of the 2011 census was 14,510. The area has been home to the football club Liverpool F.C. ever since the club&#x27;s founding in 1892. The club&#x27;s home stadium, Anfield, has been located there since its founding in 1884. As of September 2019, it is ranked the 10th most deprived ward in the United Kingdom.

==Development==
In 1836, Walton lost its independence and was made part of Liverpool Borough Council. The Ordnance Survey map from 1851 shows a house here called Anfield House (then described as &quot;Annfield House&quot;), around which the suburb developed.

From 1863, the City Council developed the Priory Road Cemetery, to which later was added a crematorium.

==Transport==
Anfield has no passenger rail service, despite the Canada Dock Branch line running through it. The area used to be served by Breck Road railway station and Walton &amp; Anfield railway station until their closure in 1948. It was announced in December 2019 that Liverpool City Council had commissioned a feasibility study to see about reopening the Canada Dock Branch to passenger traffic.

==Notable buildings==
Anfield is home to Liverpool F.C.&#x27;s Anfield Stadium.

Dan Carden MP&#x27;s office is located on Priory Road.

==Notable residents==
The Whitney gang lived in Anfield.
Comedian Alexei Sayle, actress Alison Steadman, and writer Chris Shepherd all grew up in Anfield.

<doc id="768876" wikidata="Q10526747" url="?curid=768876" title="How We Live">
<text>How We Live were an English pop duo active in the mid- to late 1980s. The band was a project between singer/keyboard player Steve Hogarth and guitarist Colin Woore, who had both previously been members of the new wave band The Europeans.

How We Live released one album, &quot;Dry Land&quot;, in 1987, but it failed to meet with commercial success and the four singles released from the album failed to chart. Though the album has had two CD reissues with different extra tracks, the &quot;12 remix of &quot;Working Girl&quot; is still only available on vinyl. The band subsequently split and Hogarth would go on to replace Fish as Marillion&#x27;s vocalist in 1989.

Marillion covered the title track of &quot;Dry Land&quot; on their 1991 album &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; and released it as the third single from the album. The verse melody of an unreleased How We Live song titled &quot;Simon&#x27;s Car&quot; was used for &quot;Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)&quot;, the first single from &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot;.

==Discography==
All of How We Live&#x27;s releases were in Europe only, on Portrait Records.

<text>The EP-101 was the first ever electronic miniprinter for printing figures and symbols and was launched by Shinshu Seiki Co., a subsidiary of Suwa Seikosha Co., Ltd, in September 1968. The drum printer wasn&#x27;t very big, being only 164 millimetres in width, 102 millimetres in height, 135 millimetres in depth and weighed 2.5 kilograms. It was created out of development work that Shinshu Seiki did for the Seiko Group when they became the official time-keepers for the 1964 Tokyo Olympic games and needed a machine that could print out times they gathered from their time-pieces.

In 1975, Shinshu Seiki began branding printers as EPSON. The brand name comes from the next generation version of this printer – &quot;son&quot; of &quot;EP&quot;, or EP-son. Shinshu Seiki renamed Epson Corporation in 1982 and was merged with Suwa Seikosha to form Seiko Epson Corporation in 1985.

<text>Langtree is a village and parish in north Devon, England, situated about south-west of Great Torrington and south of Bideford. Its name means &quot;tall tree&quot;. Torridge District Council and Devon County Council are responsible for local government, while for religious administrative purposes it is part of the Archdeaconry of Barnstaple and the Diocese of Exeter. In 2021 the parish had a population of 837.

As well as houses and farms, Langtree village contains:
* All Saints&#x27; Church – a 13th-century Anglican church.
* Langtree Community School and Nursery Unit, a state-funded primary school. It was built in 1929 and was extended in 1992 and 1998–1999.
* A modern Parish Hall, which attracted attention in 2003 by staging the controversial pantomime &quot;Snow White and the Seven Asylum Seekers&quot;, written by Bob Harrod.
* A chapel.
* The Green Dragon pub.
* A shop and post office which have now been closed.

Langtree parish also includes the smaller village of Stibb Cross.

An entry in &quot;White&#x27;s History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Devonshire&quot; (1850) reads:
&quot;LANGTREE is a considerable village, 3½ miles S.W. of Great Torrington, and has in its parish 911 souls, and 4028 acres (16 km2) of land, including the hamlets of Stowford and Week. The Trustees of the late Lord Rolle own most of the soil, and are lords of the manors of Langtree and Stowford, and patrons of the rectory ... The Church has a tower and five bells, and contains several neat monuments. There was anciently a chapel at Cross hill. The National School, built in 1840, is supported by the rector.&quot; The school referred to was situated next to the church and later used as a village hall.

&quot;The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1868) adds:
&quot;The village, which is considerable, is wholly agricultural. The soil is clayey, but in some parts rich, producing good crops of wheat and barley. The prevailing timber is oak and pine. The road from Torrington to Holsworthy and Launceston passes through the parish. The tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £510. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Exeter, value £348. The church, dedication unknown, is an ancient stone structure, with a tower containing five bells. There was formerly a chapel-of-ease at Cross-Hill. The parochial charities produce about £55 per annum. There is a parochial school for both sexes, in which a Sunday-school is also held. The Baptists and Bible Christians have each a chapel. The trustees of the late Lord Rolle are lords of the manor.&quot;

<text>, commonly known as Seiko ( , ), is a Japanese maker of watches, clocks, electronic devices, semiconductors, jewelry, and optical products. Founded in 1881 by Kintarō Hattori in Tokyo, Seiko introduced the world&#x27;s first commercial quartz wristwatch in 1969.

Seiko is widely known for its wristwatches. Seiko, Citizen and Rolex are the only three watch companies considered to be vertically integrated. Seiko is able to design and develop all the components of a watch, as well as assemble, adjust, inspect and ship them in-house. Seiko&#x27;s mechanical watches consist of approximately 200 parts, and the company has the technology and production facilities to design and manufacture all of these parts in-house.

The company was incorporated (K. Hattori &amp; Co., Ltd.) in 1917 and renamed Hattori Seiko Co., Ltd. in 1983 and Seiko Corporation in 1990. After reconstructing and creating its operating subsidiaries (such as Seiko Watch Corporation and Seiko Clock Inc.), it became a holding company in 2001 and was renamed Seiko Holdings Corporation on July 1, 2007. Seiko Holdings Corporation was renamed Seiko Group Corporation as of October 1, 2022.

Seiko watches were originally produced by two different Hattori family companies (not subsidiaries of K. Hattori &amp; Co); one was Daini Seikosha Co. (now known as Seiko Instruments Inc., a subsidiary of Seiko Holdings since 2009) and the other was Suwa Seikosha Co. (now known as Seiko Epson Corporation, an independent publicly traded company). Having two companies both producing the same brand of watch enabled Seiko to improve technology through competition and hedge risk. It also reduced risk of production problems, since one company can increase production in the case of decreased production in the other parties. Seiko remains as one of the world&#x27;s most recognised watchmaking brands.

At present, quartz and Spring Drive watches are manufactured in Shiojiri, Nagano (Epson), and mechanical watches in Shizukuishi, Iwate (Morioka Seiko Instruments). Some of the watches exported abroad, such as the Seiko 5, are also manufactured in Ninohe, Iwate, by Ninohe Tokei Kogyo (established in 1974 as a parts factory for Seiko).

==History==
=== 1881 founding to 1929 ===

In 1881, Seiko founder Kintarō Hattori opened a watch and jewelry shop called &quot;K. Hattori&quot; () in Tokyo. Kintarō Hattori had been working as clockmaker apprentice since the age of 13, with multiple stints in different watch shops, such as “Kobayashi Clock Shop”, run by an expert technician named Seijiro Sakurai; “Kameda Clock Shop” in Nihonbashi; and “Sakata Clock Shop” in Ueno, where he learned how to both sell and repair timepieces.

Around the time of Seiko&#x27;s founding, watchmakers in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya were studying and producing pocket watches based on Western products. Japanese wholesalers needed to purchase all the imported timepieces from foreign trading companies established in Yokohama, Kobe, and other open port areas.

In 1885, Hattori began dealing directly with these foreign trading firms in the Yokohama settlement focused on the wholesaling and retailing of western (imported) timepieces and machinery.

Over the years, Hattori developed a close partnership with multiple foreign trading firms, including C&amp;J Favre-Brandt, F. Perregaux &amp; Co., Zanuti &amp; Cie. and Siber &amp; Brennwald, allowing him to obtain exclusive imported timepieces and machinery, which was not available elsewhere at that time.

Hattori&#x27;s shop became increasingly popular due to the rarity of the imported watches the shop was selling, which couldn&#x27;t be found anywhere else in Japan. The growing success allowed him to relocate the company to the main street of Ginza (Tokyo), still the epicenter of commerce in Japan to this day.

In 1891, 10 years after the establishment of K. Hattori &amp; Co., the 31-year-old Kintaro was appointed director of the Tokyo Clockmaker and Watchmaker Association and member of Tokyo Chamber of Commerce.

In 1892, Hattori began to produce clocks under the name , meaning, roughly, &quot;House of Exquisite Workmanship.&quot; According to Seiko&#x27;s official company history, titled &quot;A Journey In Time: The Remarkable Story of Seiko&quot; (2003), Seiko is a Japanese word meaning ; it is homophonous with the word for .

In 1895, the watch dealer purchased the corner of Ginza 4-chome (the present-day location of WAKO), and constructed a building with a clock tower (16 meters from top to bottom), setting up shop at the new address.

Seiko launched its first in-house pocket watch, the Timekeeper, in 1895; the first Japanese-made wristwatch, the Laurel, in 1913; and the first Seiko-branded wristwatch in 1924.

In order to avoid an ill omen believed to be associated with the word &quot;GLORY&quot; in Japanese, Seikosha changed its trade mark to &quot;Seiko&quot; in 1924.

In 1929, the Seiko pocket watch was adopted as the official watch for the drivers of Japanese Government Railways.

=== 1930 to 1990 ===
Military watches produced for Japanese troops during World War II were manufactured by Seiko, which by 1938, produced 1.2 million timepieces a year. The scarcity of raw materials during the war diverted much of Seiko&#x27;s production to on-board instruments for military aircraft and ships. In contrast to Japan, Germany utilized both domestically produced and Swiss-produced watches. Japan&#x27;s isolation in the Pacific meant the country could not rely on importing foreign timepieces.
In 1951, Seiko broadcast its first radio commercial in Japan, and when Japan&#x27;s first commercial television station opened in 1953, it broadcast Japan&#x27;s first television commercial. The first Japanese commercial was supposed to be broadcast as a time signal at noon, but the video technician mishandled the equipment and the commercial lasted only three seconds, and it was rebroadcast at 7:00 p.m. the same day.

In 1956, Seiko launched Japan&#x27;s first automatic wristwatch, the Automatic. The retail price at the time was 13,500 yen, more than three times the price of men&#x27;s wristwatches, which were generally in the 4,000 yen range. In the same year, the company released the Marvel, which represented a significant improvement in accuracy, quality, and productivity over the previous model. This was achieved by increasing the outer diameter of the movement compared to the previous model.

In 1958, Seiko developed the &#x27;Dia-Shock&#x27; anti-shock device.

In 1959, Seiko launched the Gyro Marvel, which featured a revolutionary self-winding mechanism, the Magic Lever, developed by Seiko. The Magic Lever was simple in structure and had high winding performance, and popularized automatic watches among the general public.

In 1960, Seiko released the Grand Seiko, aimed to be the most accurate wristwatch in the world.

Seiko quickly developed quartz technology in preparation for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and in 1963 launched the Seiko Crystal Chronometer, a dramatically smaller version of its previous quartz clock. The quartz clock Seiko had supplied to a broadcasting station in 1959 was about the size of a wardrobe, but this new product ran on two batteries and was portable. At the Tokyo Olympics, Seiko&#x27;s mechanical stopwatches were selected as the official Olympic watches due to their high accuracy.

Seiko launched Japan&#x27;s first chronograph wristwatch, the Crown Chronograph, in 1964, Japan&#x27;s first world time wristwatch in the same year, and Japan&#x27;s first diver&#x27;s wristwatch in 1965. In 1967, Japan&#x27;s first diver&#x27;s watch with 300m water resistance was launched.

In 1967, Seiko won second and third place in a watch accuracy competition at a Neuchâtel Observatory competition; the competition was canceled after that year.

In 1968, Seiko took first place in a Geneva Observatory competition with a score of 58.19, surpassing all previous records. Swiss companies ranked first to third for their quartz movements and Seiko ranked fourth to tenth for its mechanical movements. In the competition, there were special movements for the competition.
In 1969, Seiko launched the Astron, the world&#x27;s first commercial quartz wristwatch; when it was introduced, it cost the same as a medium-sized car. Seiko later went on to introduce the first quartz chronograph. The year 1969 marked the launch of the Astron, as well as several other wristwatches that Seiko positioned as its own historical models. In the same year, Seiko introduced the Five Sport Speed Timer, the world&#x27;s first Magic Lever watch with a vertical clutch and column wheel. It was a resounding success for its compactness and practicality, and had a major influence on subsequent chronographs around the world. The company also launched the Grand Seiko V.F.A., a mechanical wristwatch with ultra-high accuracy of plus or minus two seconds per day, and the U.T.D., a mechanical wristwatch with a thickness of 1.98 mm.

Since the 1970s, Seiko has introduced a variety of wristwatches with various world firsts: in 1973, Seiko introduced the world&#x27;s first wristwatch with a LCD display capable of displaying six digits for hours, minutes and seconds; in 1975, Seiko introduced the world&#x27;s first digital watch with a stopwatch function and a diver&#x27;s watch with a titanium case. In 1978, Seiko introduced the world&#x27;s first quartz diver&#x27;s watch with a water resistance of 600 meters; in 1982, the world&#x27;s first wristwatch with a television; in 1983, the world&#x27;s first wristwatch with a record-and-play function and an analog quartz chronograph; in 1984, the world&#x27;s first wristwatch computer; and in 1986, the world&#x27;s first diver&#x27;s watch with a ceramic case water-resistant to 1000 meters.

In 1974, Seiko launched Credor, a luxury brand using precious metals and jewelry, and in 1979, Alba, a low-priced brand for young people.

In 1985, Orient and Seiko established a joint factory.

In 1986, Baselworld allowed non-European manufacturers to participate, and Seiko began exhibiting that year.
In 1988, Seiko invented the world&#x27;s first wristwatch with an innovative mechanism called &quot;Auto Quartz&quot;, in which a rotating oscillating weight rotates in response to the wearer&#x27;s arm movements, generating electricity to power the quartz. This mechanism was developed with the aim of creating a quartz watch that does not require battery replacement. This mechanism was adopted as Seiko&#x27;s core movement and later renamed &quot;A.G.S.&quot;. (Automatic Generating System). In 1991, to increase popularity, the watches were relaunched under the name &quot;Seiko Kinetic&quot;.
=== Recent development ===
In 1998, Grand Seiko was released with the first new mechanical movement in 20 years.

In 1999, Seiko launched Spring Drive, the world&#x27;s first mechanical wristwatch with the accuracy of quartz.

In 2004, the Astron, launched in 1969, was selected as an IEEE milestone. In the same year, Seiko began operating the Shizukuishi Watch Studio, which specializes in high-end watches.

In 2005, Seiko launched the world&#x27;s first solar-powered analog watch that adjusts its accuracy by receiving three radio signals from Japan, Germany, and the United States.

In 2006, Seiko launched the world&#x27;s first wristwatch based on microcapsule E-ink technology. This watch was the first Seiko watch to win an award at the Grand Prix de Genève for its innovative ability to bend the display part, in addition to providing more contrast and a wider viewing angle than conventional LCD displays.

In 2010, Seiko launched the world&#x27;s first solar radio-controlled digital watch based on the active matrix EPD system, advancing the expression of information in digital watches.
In 2012, Seiko launched the world&#x27;s first GPS solar watch, the Seiko Astron GPS Solar. Seiko positioned this watch as the second revolutionary wristwatch after the Astron, which was launched in 1969, and described that it had the ultimate practical functionality, being able to instantly display extremely accurate time anywhere in the world and working as long as there is light. Seiko&#x27;s low power consumption GPS receiver contributed to the practical application of this watch.
==Seiko Group==

K. Hattori &amp; Co. (currently Seiko Group Corporation) was one of the three core companies of the former Seiko Group. Seiko Group consisted of K. Hattori (SEIKO), Daini Seikosha (currently Seiko Instruments Inc., SII), and Suwa Seikosha (currently Seiko Epson Corporation, EPSON). Although they had some common shareholders, including the key members of the Hattori family (posterity of Kintarō Hattori), the three companies in the group were not affiliated; they were managed and operated independently.

On January 26, 2009, Seiko Holdings and Seiko Instruments announced the two companies would merge on October 1, 2009, through a share swap. Seiko Instruments became a wholly owned subsidiary of Seiko Holdings as of 1 October 2009.

On October 1, 2022, Seiko Holdings was renamed Seiko Group. Epson still develops and manufactures some of the Seiko&#x27;s highest grade watches, but is managed and operated completely independently from Seiko Group.

== Marketing ==
On January 10, 2014, on the eve of the Australian Open in Melbourne, Shinji Hattori, President of Seiko Watch Corporation, presented to Novak Djokovic a Seiko Astron GPS Solar limited edition worth $1700. It was launched worldwide with a million units, symbolizing Seiko&#x27;s partnership with the world&#x27;s no.1 professional tennis player.

Seiko – often criticised for quality standards that let misaligned chapter rings and bezels slip through – decided to move its brand positioning upmarket; in 2015, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported the Spring Drive movement’s enthusiastic reception prompted Seiko&#x27;s launch of higher-end pieces. Harvard Business School reported: &quot;In 2003, Shinji Hattori, a great-grandson of Seiko&#x27;s founder, became Seiko Watch Company&#x27;s president and CEO and felt that Seiko should raise its perceived image outside Japan. In management&#x27;s view, Seiko could claim distinction as the only &#x27;mechatronic manufacturer&#x27; in the world – a vertically integrated watchmaker that excelled in both mechanical watchmaking and micro-electronics.&quot;

===Seiko in the United States===
Seiko Corporation of America distributes Seiko watches and clocks, as well as Pulsar and Lorus brand watches, in the United States. The models available in the United States are typically a smaller subset of the full line produced in Japan. Seiko Corporation of America is headquartered in Mahwah, New Jersey, alongside the Coserv repair center. In the United States, Seiko watches are sold primarily by fine jewelers, department stores, and 19 Seiko company stores.

== Brands and product lines ==
Seiko produces watches with quartz, kinetic, solar, and mechanical movements of varying prices, ranging from around ¥4,000 (US$45) to ¥50,000,000 (US$554,000). Seiko has created many different brands in Japan and the international market including Lorus, Pulsar, and Alba.

Seiko has several lines such as the Seiko 5, luxury &quot;Credor,&quot; &quot;Prospex,&quot; &quot;Presage,&quot; &quot;Velatura&quot;, &quot;Astron&quot; and the &quot;Grand Seiko&quot; series.

=== Seiko 5 ===

Seiko 5 is a sub brand that spawned with the introduction of the Seiko Sportsmatic 5 in 1963. Since then, many models have been introduced into the lineup, comprising a variety of different styles.

The name of the Seiko 5 sub brand is a reference to 5 attributes that any watch belonging to it would typically exhibit, those being:
# An automatic watch movement
# The day and the date displayed on the dial
# Water resistance to an acceptable degree
# A recessed crown at the 4 o&#x27;clock position
# A durable case and bracelet
In spite of their association with the brand, not all of these characteristics are universal across the lineup, as certain models have omitted the Day-Date display (such as the SSA333) and/or the 4 o&#x27;clock positioning of the crown (such as the SRPG31K1 and the aforementioned SSA333).

Seiko released many models under the Seiko 5 sub brand, including large and small divers; watches featuring different strap options, such as leather, nylon, or steel; transparent, or sterile case-back versions; and many other variations.

=== Seiko Lord Matic ===
The Seiko Lord Matic series of wristwatches was a mid-range sub-luxury watch of the 1970s that featured design innovations such as faceted crystals, colorful dials and sporty bracelets.

Seiko Astron

The Seiko Astron series is a quartz watch which receives time information and location information from GPS satellites. These watches also have a solar panel which means that the battery does not need to be replaced.

=== Seiko Presage ===
The Seiko Presage series is an all-mechanical lineup, a step up from the entry-level Seiko 5 models. It has slightly more elaborate designs and complex movements, such as urushi-lacquer dials, and self-winding movements with power reserve indicators. The Presage line watches are usually priced between US$200 to US$3,000.

Seiko entered a cooperation with the traditional cloisonné maker Ando Cloisonné Company from Nagoya to produce the dial for the limited edition in 2018.

=== Seiko Prospex ===

The Seiko Prospex series includes their professional series of watches such as their diving watches, which are typically ISO 6425 rated from 200 to 1000 metres of water resistance. Other watches in the Prospex line include field and pilot style watches.

In 2021, Akio Naito, President of the Seiko Watch Corporation, said that enthusiasts&#x27; respect for the brand can &quot;influence the wider range of consumers.&quot; This influence can be seen in the Prospex range, where Seiko fans&#x27; nicknames resulted in the company eventually adopting these product names. For example, Seiko&#x27;s own London boutique identifies the Prospex SPB191J1 watch using the fans&#x27; sobriquet: &quot;Nicknamed &#x27;Shogun&#x27; by fans, meaning Japanese &#x27;Commander-in-chief&#x27;, because of its strong looks.&quot;

=== Grand Seiko ===
Prior to 1960, to challenge the status of Swiss watches and change the perception of Japanese watches, Daini Seikosha and Suwa began the discussion of a product line that can match the quality of Swiss watches under the suggestion of the parent company. At the time, Suwa Seikosha Co. was in charge of manufacturing men&#x27;s watches, so it was decided that Suwa would produce the first Grand Seiko.

The first Grand Seiko, released in 1960, was based on Seiko&#x27;s previous high-end watch, &quot;CROWN&quot;. This Grand Seiko has a 25-jewel, manual-winding, 3180 caliber, and its production was limited to 36,000 units. The watch was also the first chronometer-grade watch manufactured in Japan and was based on Seiko&#x27;s own chronometer standard.

Some Grand Seiko timepieces also incorporate the company&#x27;s Spring Drive movement, a movement that is a combination of both automatic and quartz timekeeping methods, leading to unparalleled accuracy in the world of automatic wristwatches. The most famous example is the SBGA011 Grand Seiko &quot;Snowflake&quot;, housing the 9R Spring Drive movement.

With the repositioning of Grand Seiko from a Seiko subbrand to an independent brand in 2017, Grand Seiko aimed to transition to a true luxury brand. In 2022, &#x27;Kodo Constant-Force Tourbillon SLGT 003&#x27;, featuring the world&#x27;s first combination tourbillon and constant-force mechanism on the same axis, was released, priced at 370,000 euros.

==== Design style ====

The design language of the Grand Seiko was set in 1967, with the creation of Grand Seiko 44GS. The 44GS set the ground for all future Grand Seiko with nine elements. These elements help improve the legibility of the watch under different situations, and create a sharp, crisp visual impression:
# Double width index at 12 o&#x27;clock
# Multi-faceted rectangular markers
# Highly polished bezel
# Highly polished planes and two-dimensional surface
# Half recessed crown
# Flat dial
# Multi-faceted hour and minute hands
# Curved side line
# Reverse slanted bezel wall and case side
# Dress style with simple but beautiful design
# Zaratsu polishing

=== King Seiko ===
The King Seiko line was created by Daini Seikosha to compete directly with Grand Seiko. The first King Seiko was released the year after the first Grand Seiko, in 1961. The first King Seikos were made with unmarked, manual winding, 25 jewel movements, that were not internally tested chronometers. This was followed by the release of the &#x27;44KS&#x27; movement in 1964, a remake of the 44GS, a manual winding, 18,000 bph, movement with a screwdown case back. In 1968, the 45KS was introduced with a manual winding, 36,000 bph hi-beat movement – again meant to compete with the 45GS but generally less accurate and with less finishing. King Seiko Certified Chronometer and Superior Certified Chronometers were released between 1968 and 1970. These first two were produced by Daini Seikosha but one of the most impressive King Seikos, the 56KS, was actually made by the Suwa Seikosha. The King Seiko 56KS movements were the same as those used in Grand Seiko’s 56GS series, Seiko Lord Matic watches, and Seiko chronometers. It was also introduced in 1968 and featured an automatic, 28,800 bph movement with 25 jewels and a 47-hour power reserve. These watches were all marked ‘Hi-Beat’ on the dial despite being only 28,800 bph (instead of 36,000). The 56KS was made until 1975, when the King Seiko line was discontinued by the company.

The last King Seiko collection was made by Daini, and was the 52KS, starting off in 1971 and made until 1975. This line used the 5245 and 5246 movement. These were meant to be high-end chronometers, with some even marked ‘V. F. A.’ (Very Fine Accuracy) or ‘Special’ on the dial. Many of these were of the &quot;Vanac&quot; sub-line and featured colorful dial faces and faceted crystals.

=== Other ===
Seiko produces electronic devices as well; during the 1980s, the company produced a notable range of digital synthesizers, such as the DS-202 and DS-250, for use in electronic music. Today the music division (part of Seiko Instruments Inc.) produces metronomes and tuning devices.

== Movements ==

=== Mechanical movement ===

In 1968, Seiko introduced three ten beat (ten ticks per second) calibers, the automatic caliber 61GS, the manual winding 45GS and 19GS for women&#x27;s watch. The 61GS was Japan&#x27;s first automatic ten beat watch, and it was the most accurate mechanical watch due to the high beat calibers. The calibers are considered high beat because normal mechanical movements beat six to eight times per second, and higher beat makes the watch more resistant to shock, thus achieving the high accuracy.

In 2009, Seiko released the new ten beat caliber 9S85, which is a completely new design from the previous high beat caliber. The new caliber also met the Grand Seiko Standard, a chronometer certification that the company claims to be more strict than the Chronometer Certificate in Switzerland.

List of Seiko mechanical movements
=== Quartz movement ===

On 25 December 1969, Seiko released the world&#x27;s first quartz watch, the Seiko Quartz ASTRON, marking the beginning of the quartz revolution. The watch used a crystal oscillator for accuracy, where the crystal generates steady vibration when voltage is applied to it. During the ten years of development at Suwa Seikosha, Seiko managed to create many parts which enabled the viable application of quartz in wristwatches. For example, Seiko cut the crystal oscillator into the shape of a tuning-fork, and developed an integrated circuit and step motor to operate with the signals from the crystal oscillator.
Although creating the parts that enabled quartz watches, Seiko did not monopolize the patent rights for the unique pieces, but decided to open them.

In 1973, Seiko announced the world&#x27;s first LCD quartz watch with six-digit digital display.

In 1975, Seiko launched the world&#x27;s first multi-function digital watch, the 0634.

In 1978, Seiko released the Twin Quartz watch to address the effect t of temperature on the frequency of the quartz crystal oscillator, which put a limitation on the accuracy of quartz watches. Seiko put a second crystal in the watch that is linked with a processor that detects the change in temperature and signals the main oscillator to compensate. The result was a huge improvement in the watch&#x27;s accuracy from five seconds per month to five seconds per year.

Kinetic watches were introduced by Seiko in 1986 at the Basel Fair Trade Show. These quartz watches use the motion of the wearer&#x27;s wrist to charge their battery.

=== Grand Seiko 9F quartz movement ===
The 9F quartz movement is used in Grand Seiko quartz watches.

The Grand Seiko&#x27;s 9F quartz movement is assembled entirely by hand by two expert craftsmen.

Features include:
* Backlash auto-adjust mechanism
* Twin pulse control motor
* Instant date change mechanism – it can change the date display in 1/2000th of a second
* Accuracy within +-10 seconds per year

=== Spring Drive ===

The Spring Drive was announced in 1997, developed by Yoshikazu Akahane and his team, and inspired by Yoshikazu&#x27;s vision: &quot;a watch wound by a mainspring and with one-second-a-day accuracy, a precision that only the finest electronic watches could deliver.&quot; The movement achieved high accuracy with one second per day, long power reserve (72 hours) with its unique developed alloy, fast winding with the &quot;Magic Lever&quot; design and glide-motion movement with the watch hands.
The movement uses a mainspring as a source of energy and transmits it through a gear train, just like a traditional mechanical watch, but instead of an escapement and balance wheel, Seiko used the newly developed &quot;Tri-synchro regulator&quot;, which acts like a quartz movement. The Tri-synchro regulator has three main functions: controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring, generate electricity for the low consumption (~25 nanowatts) quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel. By replacing the traditional escapement with a magnetic brake, the Spring Drive operates with lower noise and presents a glide motion hand that shows the continuous flow of time. The Spring Drive movement was also used as the basis for the first-ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk, the aptly named Seiko Spring Drive Spacewalk.

* French Open in Paris, France (1980–1991)
* Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo and later in Osaka, Japan (1984–present)

==== Other sponsorships ====
Seiko developed a digital watch styled after Venom Snake&#x27;s timepiece in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; under its Wired brand. It was launched on September 2, 2015, with the Metal Gear installment. It was limited to 2,500 pieces worldwide and was sold out via pre-orders within 5 minutes of launch. The box of the watch was designed by Metal Gear Solid artist Yoji Shinkawa. Seiko is also named as the official timekeeper of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; racing game series, published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was also the sponsor of FC Barcelona from 2011 to 2014.

Seiko was the official timekeeper of the North American Soccer League during the 2014 season.

Seiko previously sponsored Honda F1 (formerly known as BAR [British American Racing] Honda). The Honda team driver, Jenson Button, was the brand ambassador of Seiko. The company name appeared on the team&#x27;s clothing, Button&#x27;s helmet, and on the pitstop lollipops. The sponsorship lasted until the end of the 2008 season, when Honda discontinued participating in F1 racing.

Seiko has a partnership with tennis player Novak Djokovic, which started in 2014 and is set to continue at least until 2020.

Seiko is the current major sponsor for the No. 20 Team 18 Holden ZB Commodore driven by Scott Pye in the Supercars Championship.

<doc id="768929" wikidata="Q797017" url="?curid=768929" title="Cathedral of Learning">
<text>The Cathedral of Learning is a 42-story skyscraper that serves as the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s (Pitt) main campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Standing at , the 42-story Late Gothic Revival Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere and the second-tallest university building (fifth-tallest educationally purposed building) in the world, after the main building of Moscow State University. It is also the second-tallest gothic-styled building in the world, after the Woolworth Building in Manhattan. The Cathedral of Learning was commissioned in 1921 and ground was broken in 1926 under general contractor Stone &amp; Webster. The first class was held in the building in 1931 and its exterior finished in October 1934, prior to its formal dedication in June 1937. It is a Pittsburgh landmark listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Colloquially referred to as &quot;Cathy&quot; by Pitt students, the Cathedral of Learning is a steel-frame structure overlaid with Indiana limestone and contains more than 2,000 rooms and windows. It functions as a primary classroom and administrative center of the university, and is home to the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Social Work, and many of its departments, as well as the Frederick Honors College. It houses many specialty spaces, including a studio theater, food court, study lounges, offices, computer and language labs, 31 Nationality Rooms, and a half-acre (2000 m2, 22,000 ft2), 4-story-high, vaulted, gothic study and event hall. The building contains noted examples of stained glass, stone, wood, and iron work and is often used by the university in photographs, postcards, and other advertisements.

==Use==

The basement and floors up to (and including) floor 40 are used for educational purposes, although most floors above 36 house the building&#x27;s mechanical equipment. These floors include theaters, computer laboratories, language laboratories, classrooms, and departmental offices. The basement contains a black box theater and the ground floor contains computer labs, language labs, classrooms, and the Cathedral Café food court. The lobby, comprising the first through third floors, contains a massive gothic Commons Room that is used as a general study area and for special events and is ringed by three floors of classrooms, including, on the first and third floors, the 31 Nationality Rooms designed by members of Pittsburgh&#x27;s ethnic communities in the styles of different nations and ethnic groups. Twenty-nine of these serve as functional classrooms while more conventional classrooms are located on the second floor and elsewhere throughout the building. The first floor also serves as home to the offices of the Chancellor, Executive Vice Chancellor, and other administration offices, as well as the Nationality Rooms Gift Shop. The fourth floor, which was previously home to the main stacks of the university&#x27;s library and the McCarl Center for Nontraditional Student Success, now houses a mix of interdisciplinary studies programs. The fifth floor originally housed the main borrowing, reference, and reading rooms of the university library, and now houses the Department of English. The Pitt Humanities Center is housed on the sixth floor. The University&#x27;s Frederick Honors College is located on the 35th and 36th floors.

The Cathedral of Learning houses the Department of Philosophy, considered one of the top five in the United States, and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, consistently ranked at the top of the field. Other departments in the Cathedral include English, Religious Studies, Theatre Arts, and the School of Social Work which maintains the highest classrooms in the building located on the 23rd floor. Floors 38–40 are closed to the general public, as they contain electrical wiring for the building, as well as the Babcock Room, a large conference room on the 40th floor used for meetings, seminars, and special events and which provides a panoramic view of downtown Pittsburgh and the rest of the university. The 40th floor balcony also houses a nesting pair of Peregrine falcons. A view from the top is available via a webcam. Golden lights, dubbed &quot;victory lights,&quot; surround the outside of the highest floors and are lit following Pitt football wins and other notable victories, giving the upper part of the cathedral an amber glow.

The top of the building serves as the site for the transmitter of the student-run radio station WPTS-FM as well as the amateur radio repeater W3YJ which is run by the Panther Amateur Radio club on a frequency of 443.45 MHz.

==History==
In 1921, John Gabbert Bowman became the tenth chancellor of the university. At that time, the school consisted of a series of buildings constructed along Henry Hornbostel&#x27;s plan for the campus and included &quot;temporary&quot; wooden structures built during World War I. He then began to envision a &quot;tall building&quot;, that would be later termed the Cathedral of Learning, to provide a dramatic symbol of education for the city and alleviate overcrowding by adding much needed space in order to meet present and future needs of the university.

His reasoning is summarized in this quote:

Bowman looked at a plot of land named Frick Acres. On November 26, 1921, with aid from the Mellon family, the university was given the $2.5 million plot, and began plans for a proper university building on the site.

One of the foremost Gothic architects of the time, Philadelphian Charles Klauder, was hired to design the tower. The design took two years to finish, with the final plan attempting to fuse the idea of a modern skyscraper with the tradition and ideals of Gothic architecture. The plans received strong resistance from the community and from some university officials, who felt it was too tall for the city.
Local legend states that to counteract this resistance, Bowman ordered that the construction of the walls would start at the top floor and work its way down, so the project could not be canceled. This has been traced to an account on November 21, 1943, issue of &quot;At Ease&quot;, a tabloid related to local military personnel on campus, which stated that &quot;the masonry was started from the top downward.&quot; Construction photographs show that this was not the case, and that some stonework was done on the first floor before any other stonework was begun. One engineer with the company working on the Cathedral explained that the exterior walls of the cathedral are not load-bearing. Because of this, many similar buildings would start construction at the third or fourth floors. Practically, this makes sense, as it allows easy movement of building materials and equipment into and out of the building. Instead, in the cathedral&#x27;s case, the issue was one of the stone that would be used in lower stories. In fact, the quarry was not prepared to deliver the stone on schedule, so construction was delayed, and work began on the higher stories.

When construction started on the Cathedral of Learning in 1926, it was the tallest building in Pittsburgh, although the Gulf Tower (1932) was completed and surpassed it by the time the Cathedral of Learning was officially dedicated in June 1937. Today, it remains the tallest educational building in the Western hemisphere, the second tallest university building in the world behind the 36 story, 240 m (including a 57 m spire) Moscow State University main building completed in 1953, and the fourth tallest educational building in the world behind the Moscow State University and Mode Gakuen Cocoon (204 m) and Spiral Towers (170 m), both completed in 2008 and located in Japan.

===World War II===
On July 26, 1940, as World War II was starting, a bomb threat was made against the structure with extra guards being posted to secure it and the authorities not ruling out possible wartime sabotage.

During the war effort, the cathedral was assigned to house, feed and instruct roughly 1,000 of the Army Air Corps (forerunner of today&#x27;s U.S. Air Force) as well as dozens of Army engineers. The building had at least 12 floors dedicated for military use from 1943 until 1945.

==Funding==
Fundraising for this project came in many forms, including donations from industries, corporations, individuals and foreign governments. To raise public views of the cathedral, and at the same time finance the construction, Bowman started a fundraising campaign in 1925.

An important part of this campaign was a project reaching out to the children of the city entitled &quot;Buy a Brick for Pitt&quot;. Each schoolchild sent a dime ($0.10) and a letter to the university, explaining how they earned the dime for the building. In exchange, the child received a certificate for one brick contained in the cathedral. A total of 97,000 certificates were issued to children.

==Commons Room==

The main part of the cathedral&#x27;s first floor, the Commons Room, called one of the &quot;great architectural fantasies of the twentieth century&quot;, is a fifteenth-century English perpendicular Gothic-style hall that covers half an acre (2,000 m2) and extends upward four stories, reaching tall. The room was a gift of Andrew Mellon. It is a piece of true Gothic architecture; no steel supports were used in the construction of its arches. Each arch is a true arch, and they support their own weight. Each base for the arches weighs five tons, and it is said that they are so firmly placed that each could hold a large truck. The large central piers act only as screens for the structural steel that holds up the upper floors of the building.

Despite its heavy use, the Commons Room is kept quiet by the use of Guastavino acoustical tiles as the stones between the ribs of vaulting. This feature was insisted upon by Chancellor Bowman. The architect, Klauder, objected due to the increased costs of this construction method. Bowman responded with the comment: &quot;You cannot build a great University with fraud in it.&quot;

Klauder considered the Commons Room to be his greatest achievement.

Joseph Gattoni designed the stonework, much of which depicts western Pennsylvanian plant life. The walls are made of Indiana limestone and the floor is green Vermont slate.

The wrought iron in the room, including the large gates leading to the elevators, was a gift from George Hubbard Clapp and was designed by the ironworker Samuel Yellin. Over the gates are two lines by Robert Bridges, from an untitled poem:

Here is eternal spring; for you the very stars of heaven are new.

Also located in the corridors surrounding the Commons Room are plaques featuring calligraphy designed and hand-cut in slate by Edward Catich, including one featuring a poem by Lawrence Lee titled &quot;The Cathedral,&quot; as well as stained glass windows by Charles Connick.

==Nationality Rooms==


The cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms located on the first and third floors: 29 working classrooms and two rooms used mostly for display or occasional special events. Each nationality room is designed to celebrate a different culture that had an influence on Pittsburgh&#x27;s growth, depicting an era prior to (or in the singular case of the French Classroom, just after) 1787, the year of the university&#x27;s founding and of the signing of the U.S. Constitution.

The Nationality Room programs began in 1926 when Bowman decided that he wanted to involve the community as much as he could in constructing the cathedral, so he proposed that each nationality that had a significant number of people in Pittsburgh would be allowed to design their nationality&#x27;s room for the cathedral. Each group had to form a Room Committee responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided only the room and, upon completion, upkeep for perpetuity. All other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes aided by foreign governments and the rooms contain many authentic artifacts and materials from the country represented. A typical room on the 1st floor (those built between 1938 and 1957) took between three and ten years to complete and cost the equivalent of US$300,000 in 2006 dollars. More recent rooms have cost in the range of $750,000 and up.

===Classrooms===
===Proposed rooms===
There are six nationality rooms in various stages of planning to add to the current 31.
==Other notable spaces==

There are several other notable facilities and rooms within the Cathedral of Learning. In addition, these spaces do not fall under the auspices of the Nationality Rooms program.

===Babcock Room===
The Edward V. Babcock Memorial Room is a plush, carpeted, wood-paneled conference room constructed on the 40th floor for use as the university trustees&#x27; boardroom. Funded by a Babcock family grant of $327,000 ($ in dollars) and dedicated in November 1958, all of the room&#x27;s features are original, except for the lighting, furniture and carpeting. The room&#x27;s square shape is modified by four alcoves, in one of which is a portrait of Babcock by Malcolm Stevens Parcell. The walls, featuring intricate geometric patterns, are paneled in Appalachian white oak with burled walnut inlays and touches of rosewood. The windows, adorned by leaf-patterned curtains, boast a spectacular panoramic view of the surrounding area. The room is also adjoined by a kitchen. Access to the room is limited to a spiral staircase and an elevator, both requiring a key, that originate on the 36th floor. During the early 1970s at the height of student activism, a group of protesting students attempted to barricade the room during a trustees meeting. Today, the trustees have outgrown the room and generally meet in the Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union. The Babcock room now serves as a seminar and meeting room and is also used for special events. A pair of peregrine falcons nests on the balcony outside the room.

===Braun Room===

Following the opening of the Cathedral of Learning, the offices of the Dean of Women moved to the 12th floor of the Cathedral in 1938. The interior was unfinished but Dean Thyrsa Amos envisioned a dignified and beautiful space for women to meet.

When Dean Amos died in 1941, the new quarters were still unfinished. The Alumnae Association created the Thyrsa W. Amos Fund to plaster the walls and to furnish Room 1217 in her name. Room 1217 was never finished, but after World War II the other rooms on the twelfth floor were completed including room 1201, now known as the Braun Room. Mrs. A. E. Braun donated the furnishings and floral carved mahogany wood paneling which she had purchased in 1941 from the library of the home of Grant McCargo in the East End of Pittsburgh. The Braun Room was dedicated in 1946 and serves, along with its furniture, as an example of a modern reproduction of Louis XV design. Original blue carpeting was replaced in 1955 with a Persian rug, named &quot;The Iron Rug of Persia&quot;, that was donated by the daughter and son-in-law of A. E. Braun. Restored in 2015, the rug was made for a regional Khan in the northern part of Iran around 1810. Other features of the room include a low bookcase, bordered and topped with classic carving, that was crafted by university carpenters to replace the original fireplace whose inclusion was impractical on the 12th floor, along with two crystal drop chandeliers.

Dean Helen Pool Rush and her successor, Dean Savina Skewis, carried on the traditions of Dean Amos until the Dean of Women&#x27;s Office was closed in 1969, and its functions and quarters were assumed by other departments. The Braun Room is used for meetings and study abroad scholarship selection panels.

===Croghan-Schenley Ballroom===

The Croghan-Schenley room, situated on the first floor of the Cathedral in room 156, is actually two adjoining Greek Revival rooms, the Ballroom and the Oval Room, connected by a hidden passageway in the Ballroom&#x27;s fireplace. The rooms were originally part of William Croghan Jr.&#x27;s mansion, known as the Picnic House, built in 1830 in the Stanton Heights area of Pittsburgh. The rooms themselves were created in 1835 by the Philadelphia carver Mordecai Van Horn, and they have been regarded as being among the most lavish examples of Greek Revival designs in America.

His daughter, Mary Elizabeth, went to boarding school in New York, but in 1842 at the age of fifteen she eloped with 43-year-old Edward Wyndham Harrington Schenley, a captain in the British military. The elopement caused a family schism. Mary would not visit often, and in an effort to convince her to move back to Pittsburgh, the new rooms were commissioned. Following the death of William Croghan in 1850, the mansion was run by caretakers with no permanent residents for some 60 years. William S. Miller, then president of Steelwood Corp., purchased the Croghan mansion following World War II and it was soon leveled for a new housing development, but the Croghan-Schenley rooms were spared.

In 1955, the rooms, donated by Miller, were dismantled and rebuilt in the cathedral, except that the original ceilings had to be lowered about 8 inches to accommodate the available space.

In 1982, the rooms were refurbished to their 19th century glory. Highlighting the ballroom are the hand-cut glass chandelier and four wooden, hand-carved Greek columns, surviving examples of western Pennsylvania&#x27;s Greek classical revival period popular with those of means in the 1830s.

The Croghan-Schenley rooms are the last extant vestiges of the estate of Mary Schenley, who before she died gave much of her holdings and property to the city of Pittsburgh—including Schenley farms, where the Cathedral sits, and Schenley Park.
Stories tell of a ghost, speculated to be that of Mary Schenley, that is said to roam the Ballroom and Nationality Rooms. The doors to the rooms are locked every night, but furniture is sometimes said to be found rearranged by daylight staff. The swinging of the chandelier has been said to indicate her presence.

===Frick Auditorium===
The Frick Auditorium is a lecture hall in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning. Originally conceptualized as the Fine Arts Lecture Room intended to complement the Fine Arts Department then located on the seventh floor, the room was completed in 1939 and features stone mullions, chambranle, and other trim as well as wooden lecture seating and a coffered ceiling. A centerpiece element in the room is a Nicholas Lochoff reproduction of &quot;The Resurrection&quot; by Piero della Francesca that was purchased for the lecture hall by Helen Clay Frick. Frick would later donate a large collection of Lochoff reproductions to the university which are on display in the Nicholas Lochoff Cloister in the university&#x27;s Frick Fine Arts Building.

===Humanities Center===

The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Humanities Center, part of School of Arts and Sciences, is housed in the Cathedral of Learning&#x27;s room 602, which was a sixth-floor space once occupied by the Darlington Memorial Library. Following digitization and protective storage of the library&#x27;s materials, its space was renovated in 2009 by architect Rob Pfaffmann to house the center, which now includes office space for staff and visiting fellows. The Humanities Center space retains much of the original character and many of the antique furnishings originally bequeathed to the university by the Darlington family, and features moldings and green walls that are duplicated from the 18th mansion Graeme Park, a Pennsylvania colonial-era governor&#x27;s residence. The Center for Humanities was finished in time for an open house that was part a conference hosted by the center on November 14–15, 2009.
The space served as the home of The Darlington Memorial Library from 1936 until its recent conversion to the Humanities Center. The library was entered through a memorial vestibule and consisted of a central room with eight alcoves. Among other notable furnishings, it contained a wrought iron entrance gate by Samuel Yellin. The library was given to the University of Pittsburgh by the daughters of William McCullough Darlington and Mary Carson Darlington. The initial gift of eleven thousand volumes was made in 1918 by Mary O&#x27;Hara Darlington and Edith Darlington Ammon. This was followed by Mary O&#x27;Hara Darlington&#x27;s bequest in 1925 of the remainder of the family&#x27;s library and much of the family estate. The Darlington family&#x27;s tremendous interest in historical research was the force behind creating what was said to be the largest private library west of the Alleghenies. The library collection is particularly rich in material about the French and Indian War and the history of Western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley, as both William and Mary Darlington researched and published in these areas. While the collection&#x27;s main focus is on American history and literature, other collection highlights include rare maps and atlases, works on ornithology and natural history, and early travel narratives. The Darlington&#x27;s son, O&#x27;Hara Darlington, also amassed collections of Victorian literature sporting books and works of illustrators and caricaturists. The collection also has been enriched over the years by donations from other individuals and organizations, which especially have enhanced its content about the history of the Western Pennsylvania region.

Before renovation of the original library space, its materials were digitized and placed online at The Darlington Digital Library. The original, sometimes fragile, materials of the library were placed in storage for availability to researchers upon request. A virtual tour of the Darlington Memorial Library as it previously existed in the Cathedral of Learning is available at the main entrance and the main room.
===Cultural Studies, Film Studies, and GSWS program space===

Located on the fourth floor of the Cathedral of Learning, the current home of both the Cultural Studies, Film Studies, and Gender, Sexuality, &amp; Women&#x27;s Studies (GSWS) programs, was the prior home of the McCarl Center for Nontraditional Student Success until it moved to Wesley W. Posvar Hall in 2014. The space occupies what once housed two levels of the main stacks of the university&#x27;s library. The space was previously opened as the $537,000 McCarl Center in 2002. Made possible by a gift from F. James and Foster J.J. McCarl, it was designed by Alan J. Cuteri and his architectural firm Strada, LLC, and includes wood finishes, double-height spaces with high ceilings and windows, a main corridor conceived as an interior street, and many elements that refer to the Cathedral of Learning&#x27;s Gothic architecture including decorative painted metal columns with contemporary buttress-style arches. Today the space includes a resource library, offices, and seminar room, and class room that are used by the Cultural Studies and GSWS programs. Students in gender studies classes have access to the gender studies library, which houses classic and recent books on gender/sexuality, and to two gender studies classrooms. The GSWS faculty offices are also nearby. Also hanging in a hallway on the fourth floor outside the space, three unsigned and undated glass-encased murals that depict Renaissance painting styles and which have long belonged to the university but are of unknown origin.

===Mulert Memorial Room===

Located in room 204, the walnut-paneled Mulert Memorial classroom was designed by Philadelphia architect Gustav Ketterer and university architect Albert Klimcheck. The room features wood floors, fluted ionic columns, red velvet draperies, and student chairs with leather seats. The room&#x27;s doors have fluted jams and panelings of Greek rosettes. A Mulert family coat-of-arms and memorial inscription is located on the rear wall of the room. The room was provided for in the will of the late Mt. Lebanon resident Justus Mulert, the room was dedicated on December 21, 1942, and serves as a memorial to Mulert&#x27;s wife, Louise and his son Ferdinand Max, who died in 1912 during his senior year at Washington and Jefferson College.

===Richard E. Rauh Studio Theatre===

The Richard E. Rauh Studio Theatre, a facility utilized by the Department of Theatre Arts, is located in the basement of the cathedral. The Rauh Studio Theatre is a black box space that can be configured for almost any set requirements. It is home to student-directed laboratory productions, play readings, Dark Night Cabaret, and played host to Pittsburgh&#x27;s longest-running theatre show, Friday Nite Improvs, started in 1989 by graduate theatre students. In 2017 the Studio Theatre was named in honor of Pitt alumnus Richard E. Raugh who donated $1 million to support it and the university&#x27;s theater productions.

===Frederick Honors College===

The Frederick Honors College, dedicated in 1986, is housed in a 2002-2003 renovated space on the 35th and 36th floors of the cathedral. The Frederick Honors College provides support and enriched opportunities for scholarship among the university&#x27;s undergraduates and offers a Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil) degree.

The 2002-2003 renovation, by Rothschild Doyno Collaborative of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Strip District, showcased an existing two-story arched window that is visible at night for miles around. The four-leaf medieval quatrefoil medallion at the top of the cathedral is a central motif in the design of the Honors College. Stained glass behind the reception desk at the center of the space was designed by Glenn Greene Glass of Regent Square and centers on a design representing the four seasons, done in polished agate. Wrought ironwork was produced by Vic Reynaud of Technique Manufacturing in the spirit of Samuel Yellin who did the Commons Room ironwork.

==Recent proposed changes to the Cathedral==

In the early 2000s, there was some controversy over whether university funds should be used to illuminate the Cathedral at night, or to clean the building&#x27;s façade. The cleaning was abandoned because it was too costly. Some Oakland residents spoke out against the cleaning, stating that the years of soot should stay as an homage to Pittsburgh&#x27;s industrial past. However, the university approved nearly $5 million for cleaning and restoration of stonework on February 28, 2007. The work was completed at the end of 2007, restoring the exterior of the building to its original condition.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the cathedral was deemed &quot;at risk&quot; because no obstacles were in place to prevent a vehicle from driving into the entrances of the building. To address this concern, the university installed bollards that rise out of the sidewalk.

, around 200 window air conditioners operated in the building. During the 2000s, the university focused upon providing air-conditioning to the first four floors, which contain many classrooms. The plan called for the complete central cooling of the entire Cathedral of Learning by the end of the decade.

In 2014 the Property and Facilities Committee approved a plan for a $10.4 million upgrade of the building&#x27;s elevator system. This is the second major upgrade of the elevators implemented in the building&#x27;s history. Originally manually controlled and later automated to Westinghouse Selectomatic in 1971, the system was completely modernized into Otis Compass+ destination dispatch in 2016.

<text>Ronaldo da Costa (born 7 June 1970) is a Brazilian former long-distance runner and former world-record holder for the marathon distance.

==Career==
Da Costa broke the ten-year-old marathon world record in 1998 in Berlin, having been fifth-placed in the previous year. The record had been held by Belayneh Densamo from Ethiopia at the Rotterdam Marathon in April 1988. The record fell in the following year, almost eleven months later. During his record run Da Costa also was the first man to officially reach the 40 km mark under two hours. He arrived at the 40K split in 1:59:55.

The youngest of eleven children, Da Costa became a national hero after winning the internationally competed São Silvestre Brazilian road race (15 km) in 1994. The same year he won the 5,000 m in the Ibero-American Championships entered by south-western European, Central and Southern American countries. From 1997, aged 27, until 2003 Da Costa achieved top-20 results in four marathons, however unlike most marathon record holders, did not win any international marathons apart from his world-record-breaking run.

<text>The Dinka people () are a Nilotic ethnic group native to South Sudan. The Dinka mostly live along the Nile, from Mangalla-Bor to Renk, in the region of Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile (two out of three provinces that were formerly part of southern Sudan), and the Abyei Area of the Ngok Dinka in South Sudan.

They number around 4.5 million, according to the 2008 Sudan census, constituting about 40% of the population of that country and the largest ethnic group in South Sudan. The Dinka refer to themselves as (singular) and (plural).

==Origins==

The Dinka originated from the Gezira in what became Sudan. In medieval times this region was ruled by the kingdom of Alodia, a Christian, multi-ethnic empire in Nubia. Living in its southern periphery and interacting with the Nubians, the Dinka absorbed a sizable amount of Nubian vocabulary. From the 13th century, with the disintegration of Alodia, the Dinka began to migrate out of Gezira, fleeing slave raids, military conflict, and droughts.

Conflict over pastures and cattle raids has been happening between Dinka and Nuer as they battled for grazing land.

Dinka migration from Gezira &amp; Alodia

The Dinka presence in Alwa suggests a significant historical connection between the Dinka and the Kingdom of Alwa. Cultural practices, such as beer-drinking rituals during sowing and harvesting dhurra, reflect similarities to Nubian traditions noted by Ibn Selim el-Assouani, indicating a continuity of influence from Alwa. Historical accounts, including manuscripts from the 18th century, reference the Dinka&#x27;s ancestral ties to the Alwan Nubians, with early modern Sudanese manuscript writers noting that they are derived from the &quot;Anag&quot;, a term used by Spaulding to describe eastern sudanic speaking peoples who were a part of the kingdom of Alodia. Linguistic studies support the idea that the Dinka resided in the Gezira, which was under Alwa&#x27;s influence before their migration southward, likely due to political upheaval and increased slavery following Alwa&#x27;s decline in the 13th century. Shared Nilotic traditions, such as human sacrifice and ceremonial regicide, further indicate a cultural heritage influenced by Nubian practices. Additionally, 13th-century accounts by Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Andalusi describe the Damadim, who were engaged in conflict with the Alodians, highlighting interactions between Nilotic groups and Nubian territories. Archaeological evidence, including the tradition of king-killing, links the Dinka to later groups who lived in Alodia&#x27;s successor state Fazughli where the custom persisted into the 19th century. The political instability of Alwa coincided with the rise of slave raiding, creating social pressures that may have prompted Dinka migration south. Linguistically, the divergence of the Dinka language from other Western Nilotic languages at the end of the first millennium suggests an established presence in the region prior to major migrations. Lastly, Dinka oral traditions recounting southward migrations align with their historical narrative in the Gezira, reinforcing the significance of their interactions with Nubian cultures. Collectively, these factors support the argument that the ancestors of the Dinka were closely connected to the kingdom of Alwa, shaping their cultural practices and historical trajectory.

The Damadim, a group of Africans mentioned by various medieval Arab writers during the 13th century, may have been ancestors of the Dinka and other Western Nilotic groups like the Luo peoples. They were reported to live southwest of Alodia, possibly in the Southern Gezira or around the Bahr al-Ghazal and Sobat regions of South Sudan. Stephanie Beswick suggests that the Dinka&#x27;s ancestors could have been based along the White Nile in the Gezira plains. The Damadim were known for their raids and conquests, notably their sacking of the Christian Kingdom of Alodia&#x27;s capital, Soba, around 1220 A.D. During this period, they were referred to as the &quot;Tatars of the Sudan&quot; due to their simultaneous raids with the Mongol invasions of Persia. Archaeological evidence from Soba indicates significant destruction, including the looting of burial sites and the destruction of two major churches, possibly tied to the Damadim conquest. Despite the limited sources, the Damadim&#x27;s movements and activities provide a potential link to the later (western) Nilotic migrations into South Sudan that would occur post-1000 A.D. and are linked with the introduction of humped cattle.

The Dinka migrations southward during the 15th to 18th centuries played a crucial role in shaping their territorial dominance in what is now South Sudan. Following the collapse of the Alodian Kingdom and the establishment of the Funj Sultanate in 1504 by Sultan Amara Dunqas, the Dinka, alongside other Nilotic groups like the Shilluk, moved further south, clashing with the Funj and other local populations. Oral traditions and archaeological evidence suggest that the Dinka displaced and absorbed various groups in their path, including the remnants of the Funj people, who were themselves possibly linked to the Nubian traditions of medieval Alodia. These conflicts between the Dinka and the Funj are well-documented in Dinka oral histories, with stories of fierce battles where the Dinka eventually forced the Funj northward, allowing them to establish their sultanate as Sennār, which the Dinka would also raid in the following centuries. Over time, however, the Dinka and Funj developed more complex relations, with Dinka warriors serving as mercenaries in the Funj provinces, and Dinka merchants engaging in the regional slave trade. Despite these evolving relations, the Dinka continued to expand into western and southern territories, solidifying their presence and dominance in much of modern South Sudan.

The Dinka&#x27;s religions, beliefs, and lifestyle have led to conflict with the Arab Islamic government in Khartoum. The Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army, led by Dinka Dr. John Garang De Mabior, took arms against the government in 1983. During the subsequent 21-year civil war, many thousands of Dinka, along with non-Dinka southerners, were massacred by government forces. Since the independence of South Sudan, the Dinka, led by Salva Kiir Mayardit, engaged in a civil war with the Nuer and other groups, who accuse them of monopolising power.

=== Christianity ===
In 1983, due to Sudan&#x27;s second civil war, many educated Dinka were forced to flee the cities to rural areas. Some were Christians who had been converted by the Church Missionary Society. Among them were ordained clergymen who began preaching in the villages. Songs and praise were used to teach the mostly illiterate Dinka about the faith. Most Dinka converted to Christianity and are learning to adapt traditional religious practices to Christian teachings. The conversion took place in rural villages and among Dinka refugees country. The Lost Boys of Sudan were converted in significant numbers in the refugee camps of Ethiopia.

===Dinka massacre===

Between 2013 and 2014, forces led by the breakaway Riek Machar faction deliberately killed an estimated 2,000 civilians from Hol, Nyarweng, Twic east and Bor and wounded several thousand more over two months. Much of their wealth was destroyed, which led to mass starvation deaths. It is estimated that 100,000 people left the area following the attack.

== Physique ==
Dinka are noted for their height, and, along with the Tutsi of Rwanda, they are the tallest group in Africa. Roberts and Bainbridge reported an average height of in a sample of 52 Dinka Agaar and in 227 Dinka Ruweng measured in 1953–1954. However, the stature of Dinka males later declined, possibly as a consequence of undernutrition and conflicts. An anthropometric survey of Dinka men, war refugees in Ethiopia, published in 1995, found a mean height of .

==Agriculture and pastoral strategies==


Southern Sudan is &quot;a large basin gently sloping northward&quot;, through which flow the Bahr el Jebel River, the White Nile, the Bahr el Ghazal (Nam) River and its tributaries, and the Sobat, all merging into a vast barrier swamp.

Vast oil areas are present to the south and east on the flood plain, a basin in southern Sudan into which the rivers of Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia drain from an ironstone plateau that belts the regions of Bahr El Ghazal and Upper Nile.

The terrain can be divided into four land classes:
* Highlands: higher than the surrounding plains by a few centimetres; there host permanent settlements. Vegetation consists of open thorn woodland and/or open mixed woodland with grasses.
* Intermediate Lands: slightly below the highlands, commonly subject to flooding from rainfall in the Ethiopian and East/Central African highlands. Vegetation is mostly open perennial grassland with some acacia woodland and other sparsely distributed trees.
* Toic: land seasonally inundated by rivers and inland water courses, retaining enough moisture throughout the dry season to support cattle grazing.
* Sudd: permanent swampland below the level of the ; covers a substantial part of the floodplain; provides good fishing but not grazing; historically a physical barrier to outsiders.

The ecology of the large basin is unique; until recently, wild animals and birds flourished, rarely hunted by the agro-pastoralists.

The climate determines the Dinka&#x27;s migration patterns, responding to the periodic flooding and dryness of their surroundings. They begin moving around May–June, at the onset of the rainy season, migrating to their settlements of mud and thatch housing situated above flood level, where they plant their crops of millet and other grains. These rainy season settlements feature other permanent structures such as cattle byres (luak) and granaries. During the dry season (beginning about December–January), everyone except the aged, ill, and nursing mothers migrates to semi-permanent dwellings in the for cattle grazing. The cultivation of sorghum, millet, and other crops begins in the highlands in the early rainy season, and the harvest begins when the rains are heavy in June–August. Cattle are driven to the in September and November when the rainfall drops off and graze on crop remnants.

While the Dinka are often seen as only pastoralists, they are actually agro-pastoralists. Agriculture plays a very big part in their livelihood, with Sorghum being their most important crop grown. The Dinka also grow okra, sesame, pumpkin, cow peas, maize, cassava, ground nuts, different types of beans, water melons, tobacco and millet. In Dinka society, both genders engage in cultivation, and on big farms the women brew beer and everyone is involved. Before the Sudanese civil wars each household cultivated an average of two acres of sorghum around their homestead along with other crops. An estimated 87% of total calories and 76% of protein by weight are provided by crop production compared with 13% of calories and 24% of protein derived from livestock produce. Today, 83% of all available labor is estimated to be employed in agricultural activities compared with only 17% in livestock husbandry. In recent times, some poor or cattleless Dinka have farmed the land of their non-Dinka neighbors. According to the Balanda Bviri politician Bandindi Pascal Uru: &quot;The Dinka are good cultivators; they cultivate slowly but surely for hours. When the Dinka leave the business of cattle they take the hoe very seriously.&quot;

The connection of agriculture and economics to Dinka marriage is important. Grain as well as cattle have been and continue to be used in both bartering and bridewealth payments. Wealth is acquired when a man and his family produce a small surplus of crops which they convert into a more stable and valuable resource, cattle. In turn, this enables a man to acquire more wives, more children, and thus more economic and political power. In Dinka society cattle acquired by the wealth yielded from agriculture are considered a more stable form of &quot;property.&quot; If a Dinka couple divorce the cows given as bridewealth may be returned to the former husband. However, those Dinka male members of a clan who possess animals bought with grain, rather than acquired by way of marriage payments, are more honored and given more respect because their wealth is perceived as being more stable. Thus: &quot;this cattle is not returnable and does not have external links and cannot be taken back easily, for example, by divorce. It therefore represents ‘pure property’ derived from labor and this kind of man has much more stable wealth and is more honored. However, no one has all cattle that are free of ties.&quot; Because of the link between agriculture, wealth, and marriage the Dinka grow a wide variety of crops.

===Caudatum sorghum===
During their migrations, the Dinka introduced a new variety of sorghum into southern Sudan. Caudatum sorghum is drought resistant and produces well with very little care. This variety of Sorghum was not grown by tribes in the region and during the 1300s to 1600s great droughts were occurring all over east and southern Africa which caused many former tribes of south Sudan like the Luo to migrate southwards (this drought is recorded in Luo oral history as the &quot;Nyarubanga&quot; famine). The tribes that did not migrate had only the option (if their crops completely died) to be in service of their incoming wealthier Agro-pastoral neighbours like the Dinka.

===Hump backed cattle===
The adoption of Sanga and Zebu hump backed cattle was invaluable to the expansion of the Dinka throughout South Sudan. Hump backed cattle were considerably stronger than the previous humpless breeds in southern Sudan and are capable of withstanding long-distance transhumance patterns. Even more importantly, they were less affected by drought. The tribes of south Sudan did not possess these cattle, which gave the Dinka a large advantage when they introduced them in their southern migration. There was a long series of droughts that plagued Southern Sudan during this time period intensified the reliance on cattle for the people of the region, since livestock are indispensable in bad years when crop failure occurs. The introduction of this new breed by the Dinka was a significant causative factor in the spread of modern patterns of Nilotic pastoralism in Southern Sudan. Eventually these cattle replaced all of the previous humpless breeds. The domestication of caudatum sorghum along with the more durable breeds of cattle introduced into this region of Southern Sudan an economic system of the greatest efficiency in Sudan and East Africa, giving the Dinka a military and political advantage over all other tribes in the region. These integrated systems were able to support population increases in the Bahr el-Ghazal and later expansions towards the west.

==Cultural and religious beliefs==

Dinka religious beliefs and practices also reflect their lifestyle. The Dinka religion, like most other Nilotic faiths, is polytheistic, but has one creator, Nhialic, who leads the Dinka pantheon of gods and spirits. He is generally distant from humans and does not directly interact with them. The sacrificing of oxen by the &quot;masters of the fishing spear&quot; is central to Dinka religious practice. Young men become adults through an initiation ritual that includes marking the forehead with a sharp object. During this ceremony, they acquire a second cow-color name. The Dinka believe they derive religious power from nature and the world around them rather than from scripture.

Men and women eat separately. When milk supply is low, children get priority. Children are fed milk from 9–12 months. After about one year, children start eating solid food (porridge). After children turn three, they eat two meals a day. Adults also eat two meals a day.

In Dinka territory there exist a number of mounds, described by the Dinka as “pyramids,” which have religious significance to those who tend to them. These mounds were built in the form of a cone and the material used was cattle ashes, cow dung, cotton soil, clay, and debris. In all cases the history of the origin of each mound is connected to a prominent Dinka priest who ordered its construction by the people as a monument to his name.
===Pyramid of Alel===
A pyramid of stones known as Alel exists in the territory of Western Luaic Dinka in the town of Makuac. This pyramid entombs the body of a prominent Eastern Twic Dinka priest named Kuol Alel who led his people across from the banks of the eastern Nile and in the process of migrating west died in this region. Every year there is a celebration held at Alel in honor of this prominent leader. The pyramid is located north of the Paliang region in the Bahr el-Ghazal, and local Dinka estimate that it pre-dates the Egyptian colonial period (1821) and hence is at least over 200 years old.

===Pyramid of Yik Ayuong===
In Padang territory in northern Dinka territory east of the Nile among the Dunghol Dinka and north of the city of Malakal, the pyramid of a great ancestor and prominent priest, Ayuong Dit, is located at the holy village of Rukcuk. It was constructed on the site of this priest&#x27;s luak. The mound was built over the body of this priest who, with his wife and eight bulls, was locked up in their cattle byre by his express orders. District Commissioner Ibrahim Bedri who served during the British colonial period noted that the pyramid &quot;was seventy-five paces in circumference and twenty-six paces along the slope. During the harvest season of each year it was cleared of grass, more earth was added to it, and the surface smoothed by women who made stripes along the pyramid with large quantities of durra (flour). This was in preparation for the annual ceremony yairunka baiet, which took place at the pyramid. During the celebrations the people gathered together for communal offerings to the spirit of Ayuong Dit and a “new fire” ceremony was performed in which eight bulls were sacrificed to bring fertility to the women.&quot; Today this mound is known as Yik Ayuong.

===Pyramid of Luak Deng===
The pyramid of Luak Deng is said to be the &quot;Mecca&quot; of the Dinka and Nuer people and contains the shrine of their deity (and possibly real historical figure) Deng Dit (Deng the Great). It comprises a palisade standing on higher ground near a picturesque pool of water surrounded by ardeiba and suba trees. This pyramid is connected in mythology with a chain of lesser shrines in the former Nyarruweng Dinka region in what has now become the territory of the Gaweir Nuer. Around the shrine and within a few miles of it reside a small section of Rut Dinka who have settled back and live there by agreement with the Nuer to tend the shrine. Luak Deng has become a shrine of great significance for both the Dinka and Nuer people.

===Pyramid of Pwom Ayuel (or Aiwel)===
The pyramid of Pwom Ayuel is said to be the burial place of Ayuel, the culture hero of the Dinka. It is found in what has now become Nuer territory on the southern part of an island formed by the Bahr el-Zeraf and Bahr el-Jebel Rivers (Zeraf Island). Some Dinka myths suggest that Ayuel was killed by external forces beyond his control. Aliab Dinka Parmena Awerial Aluong recounts a different oral history that suggests that the mound was built on the orders of Ayuel Longar himself. According to historical accounts there were many years of toil in the early days during which Ayuel, who had reached the Nile and Sobat Rivers, ordered his people to construct a large monument. Some people died in the building of this structure, their bodies adding to the rising edifice. Some Dinka say this mound was built after Ayued&#x27;s death. Today the mound remains a center of great sanctity, but is no longer attended with communal gatherings and ritual operations.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Dinka refugees were portrayed in works such as &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; by Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk, Joan Hechts&#x27; book &quot;The Journey of the Lost Boys&quot; and the fictionalized autobiography of a Dinka refugee, Dave Eggers&#x27; &quot;What Is the What: The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng&quot;. Other books on and by the Lost Boys include &quot;The Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; by Mark Bixler, &quot;God Grew Tired of Us&quot; by John Bul Dau, &quot;They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky&quot; by Alephonsion Deng, Benson Deng, and Benjamin Ajak and &quot;A Long Walk to Water&quot; by Linda Sue Park. In 2004 the first volume of the graphic novel &quot;Echoes of the Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; was released in Dallas, Texas.

==Dinka tribal groups==
This list of Dinka tribal grouping by region. Note that these divisions are further divided into several subdivisions; for example, Dinka Rek is subdivided into Aguok, Kuac, and many other things, but they speak the same language; only the pronunciation is slightly different.

*Dinka Agar (Lakes State), Bahr El Ghazal 
* Dinka Apaak Lakes State Bahr El Ghazal
* Dinka Gok Lakes State Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Ciec (Lakes State), Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Aliab (Lakes State), Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Twic (Warrap State), Barh El Ghazal
*Dinka Rek (Warrap State, and parts of NBG and Western Barh El Ghazal), Bahr El Ghazal
* Dinka Luanyjang - Warrap State Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Malual (NBG), Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Ngok (Abyei, Malakal), Bahr El Ghazal
*Dinka Padang (Unity State), Upper Nile
*Dinka Bor (Upper Nile Region]), Jonglei
*Dinka Nyarweng, Jonglei
*Dinka Hol, Jonglei 
*Dinka Twic East Jonglei 
*Ruweng, (Unity State), Upper Nile
*Dongjol , Upper Nile
*Ageer , Nyial, Upper Nile,
*Abelang, Upper Nile,

The number of Dinka sub-divisions is contested, as the border between groups, sub-divisions, and sections is blurred and often difficult to determine. The Atuot people can be divided into Apaak and Reel, Bor, Twic, Nyarweng and Hol and Panaruu into Awet and Kuel and Jieng into Ador and Lou.

The Dinka people have no centralised political authority. Instead their clans are independent but interlinked. Some traditionally provide ritual chiefs, known as the &quot;masters of the fishing spear&quot; or&quot; beny bith&quot;, who provide leadership and are at least in part hereditary.

<text>The Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) conference series is a hacker convention sponsored by the security hacker magazine &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot; that until 2020 was typically held at Hotel Pennsylvania, in Manhattan, New York City. 

Usually occurring biennially in the summer, there have been fourteen conferences to date. HOPE 2020, originally planned to be held at St. John&#x27;s University, was instead held as a nine-day virtual event from July 25 to August 2, 2020. The most recent conference, &quot;HOPE XV&quot;, was held at St. John&#x27;s University in Queens from July 12 to 14, 2024. HOPE features talks, workshops, demonstrations, tours, and movie screenings.

HOPE was significantly inspired by the quadrennial Hack-Tic events in the Netherlands which also inspired the annual Chaos Communication Congress (C3) held in Germany. Summercon was an additional influential predecessor.

== Structure ==
HOPE has been held at Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City every time except once since 1994. The event is always structured in a similar way. It consists of three days and three nights of activities, including talks, workshops, and performances. It also features &quot;hackerspace villages&quot;, a film festival, lock picking villages, a wide variety of vendors, art installations, live video, vintage computers, robots, an amateur/ham radio station, electronics workshops, and book signings.

The &quot;closing ceremony&quot; is a regular part of the event, celebrating the event, the organizers, and volunteers, but also features performances. Since 2006, monochrom&#x27;s Johannes Grenzfurthner is a regular performer at the closing ceremony.

== Conferences ==
=== HOPE: Hackers on Planet Earth ===
Held August 13–14, 1994 at the Hotel Pennsylvania, the first HOPE conference marked &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot;&#x27;s 10th anniversary. Over 1,000 people attended, including speakers from around the world. Access to a 28.8 kbit/s local network was provided. This conference was visited and covered in the second episode of the &quot;Your Radio Playhouse&quot; show, later renamed &quot;This American Life&quot;.

=== Beyond HOPE ===
The August 8–10, 1997 Beyond HOPE conference was held at the Puck Building, in Manhattan, New York City. Attendance doubled, with 2,000 attendees. Bell Technology Group helped to support the hackers. The hacker group L0pht Heavy Industries presented a panel discussion that covered some of their recent projects, accomplishments, emerging trends and shortcomings in technologies, and a deep dive into Windows NT password internals. A TAP reunion and a recorded live broadcast of &quot;Off the Hook&quot; took place. 
A 10 Mbit/s local network was provided to attendees.

=== H2K ===
The July 14–15, 2000 HOPE returned to the Hotel Pennsylvania, where subsequent conferences have been held. The conference ran 24 hours a day, bringing in 2,300 attendees. Jello Biafra gave a keynote speech. In a cultural exchange between the punk rock icon/free speech activist and the hacker community, Jello drew connections between the two communities, despite his lack of computer experience. The EFF also raised thousands of dollars. The conference provided a working Ethernet and a T1 link to the internet.

=== H2K2 ===
H2K2, July 12–14, 2002, had a theme focused on U.S. Homeland Security Advisory System. H2K2 included two tracks of scheduled speakers, with a third track reserved for last-minute and self-scheduled speakers, a movie room, retrocomputing, musical performances, a State of the World Address by Jello Biafra, keynotes by Aaron McGruder and Siva Vaidhyanathan and discussions on the DMCA and DeCSS. &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot; premiered on Friday evening (July 14). The conference provided wireless 802.11b coverage and wired Ethernet, an open computer area for access to a 24-hour link to the Internet at &quot;T-1ish&quot; speeds, made available by the DataHaven Project and an internal network.

=== The Fifth HOPE ===
The Fifth HOPE, July 9–11, 2004, had a theme on propaganda, and commemorated the anniversaries of both the H.O.P.E. conferences and &quot;Off the Hook&quot; (with a live broadcast of the show from the conference, Beyond H.O.P.E.). Keynotes speakers were Kevin Mitnick, Steve Wozniak, and Jello Biafra. There was also a presentation by &quot;members&quot; of the Phone Losers of America who celebrated their tenth anniversary. The Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective celebrated its twentieth anniversary at the conference. The conference provided access to a four-layer public network with two T1 lines, plus backup links to the internet via a public terminal cluster, various wired connections, a WiFi network on three floors and a video network.

===HOPE Number Six===
HOPE Number Six, July 21–23, 2006, included talks from Richard Stallman and Jello Biafra. 
Kevin Mitnick was scheduled to be at the conference but was unable to appear: while on vacation in Colombia an illness prevented his timely return to the U.S. HOPE Number Six had a 100-megabit Internet connection; the conference organizers claimed it was the fastest Internet connection to-date at any U.S. hacker conference. The event&#x27;s theme was based on the number six and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (a designation shared by the titular &quot;prisoner,&quot;).
Notable occurrences:
* &quot;Steve Rambam&quot;, a private investigator heading Pallorium, Inc., an online investigative service, was scheduled to lead a panel discussion titled &quot;Privacy is Dead... Get Over It.&quot; A few minutes before the start of the panel, Rambam was arrested by the FBI on charges that he unlawfully interfered with an ongoing case Federal prosecutors filed against a former Brooklyn assistant New York district attorney indicted in January 2003 on a count of money-laundering. The charges were eventually dropped and the talk was subsequently held in November 2006, long after the conference.
* Jello Biafra began his talk by referring to the arrest of Steve Rambam, noting the convention had been more &quot;spook heavy&quot; than usual. He then announced a &quot;special message&quot; to &quot;any Federal agents that may be in the audience&quot;, and mooned the convention.

=== The Last HOPE ===
The &quot;Last HOPE&quot; took place July 18–20, 2008 at the Hotel Pennsylvania. A change from past years was the use of an Internet forum to facilitate community participation in the planning of the event.

The conference name referred to the expectation that this would be the final H.O.P.E. conference due to the scheduled demolition of its venue, the Hotel Pennsylvania. The Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation was created to work toward keeping the building from being demolished by its then-new owner, Vornado Realty Trust.
The &quot;Next HOPE&quot; was scheduled for Summer 2010. At the closing ceremony it was revealed that the use of the word &quot;last&quot; could also refer to the previous event, or one that had ended (referring to The Last HOPE itself).

Steven Levy gave the keynote address. Kevin Mitnick, Steve Rambam, Jello Biafra, and Adam Savage of &quot;MythBusters&quot; were featured speakers. Descriptions and audio of the talks can be found at thelasthope.org

=== The Next HOPE ===
The 8th HOPE convention, &quot;The Next HOPE&quot;, took place on July 16–18, 2010. The Next HOPE was held at the Hotel Pennsylvania, as the plans by Vornado to demolish the hotel are on hold.

=== HOPE Number Nine ===
HOPE Number Nine occurred July 13–15, 2012 at Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan.

Keynote presentations for HOPE Number Nine were given by The Yes Men (with Andy Bichelbaum as principal speaker and Vermin Supreme also participating) and NSA whistleblower William Binney. Chris Kubecka, principal speaker of a presentation about internet censorship was served a cease and desist letter in an attempt to censor the presentation by Unisys and threatened with termination for a presentation titled &quot;The Internet is for Porn! How High Heels and Fishnet Have Driven Internet Innovation and Information Security&quot;. Unisys demanded all information regarding the presentation be removed from the internet, but the Streisand effect occurred, with the censorship attempt posted on thousands of websites instead. A first for the conference, a ghost speaker @JK47theweapon had to deliver most of the presentation due to legal threats against Kubecka. Prior to beginning, the MC invited &quot;any hangers on or associates of the law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie&quot; to speak to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Baker &amp; McKenzie is the law firm of Unisys Netherlands which threatened to terminate its employee by letter for giving a presentation about internet censorship.

=== HOPE X ===

HOPE X took place from July 18–20, 2014 at Hotel Pennsylvania. The keynote speakers were Daniel Ellsberg and Edward Snowden; also featured was noted former NSA official and whistleblower Thomas Drake. The theme of the conference was &quot;dissent&quot;, and whistle-blowing was a topic of a good number of talks. But the conference also featured critical talks about the state of hackdom, for example Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom spoke about the problems of &quot;rockstar martyrdom&quot; within the hacker scene and the creation of hacker cult figures (like Snowden, Appelbaum or Assange) by unreflective members of the community or the media.

Notable changes included a massive increase in available bandwidth. Previous conferences had a 50 Mbit connection; HOPE X had a 10 Gbit fibre optic connection provided by Hurricane Electric. This geometric increase in bandwidth made possible live streaming of all conference talks in real time. The Ellsberg/Snowden keynote was seen in over 120 countries. This also was the first year all conference areas were fully connected to the conference network, albeit with the Workshop floor with slightly limited connectivity (a 1 Gbit connection, as compared to the 10 Gbit backbone of the other conference spaces). Five different wireless networks were provided to conference attendees. The hammocks on the mezzanine level, which provided a place for some attendees to sleep if they were unable to procure a place to otherwise do so, were replaced by inflatable furniture in a dedicated &quot;Chill Space&quot; area. Mezzanine space was also explicitly dedicated to attendee meetups in the form of villages, similar to assemblies at Chaos Communication Congresses and villages at hacker camps, specifically &quot;Village Zone A&quot; (primarily a soldering and electronics workshop), &quot;Village Zone B&quot;, &quot;Lockpickers Village&quot;, and &quot;Noisy Square&quot;. Workshop tracks were published in the schedule and the conference took nearly all the hotel&#x27;s available meeting space.

=== HOPE XI ===
HOPE XI (The Eleventh HOPE) took place from July 22–24, 2016 at Hotel Pennsylvania. Cory Doctorow was the keynote speaker. Like last time, HOPE XI was provided Internet transit by Hurricane Electric at 111 Eighth Avenue over a fiber connection leased from RCN Corporation. Aruba Networks sponsored 50 wireless access points which were used to provide 3 wireless networks for attendees, two of which were secured with either WPA or PSK, another network for the NOC, and one for the press and speakers.

Network connectivity was fully provided for in all areas, which came into use throughout the conference as many talks were filled to capacity and attendees either watched streams on their own devices or in designated overflow and viewing areas.

=== The Circle of HOPE (HOPE 12) ===
The 12th HOPE conference, &quot;The Circle of HOPE&quot;, occurred July 20–22, 2018. Speakers included Chelsea Manning, Barrett Brown, Richard Stallman, Jason Scott, Matt Blaze, Micah Lee, and Steve Rambam, among many others. The conference was marked by protests from alt-right activists.

=== HOPE 2020 ===
A conference was originally planned for July 31-August 2, 2020 at a new venue, St. John&#x27;s University in Queens. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was changed to a nine-day virtual event from July 25 to August 2, 2020. In addition to a longer schedule for talks, most of the originally planned events will be streamed, including workshops and musical performances. Keynote speakers are Libby Liu of the Open Technology Fund (OTF), Flavio Aggio of the World Health Organization (WHO), Idalin Bobé of TechActivist.org, Tiffany Rad of Anatrope Inc, Yeshimabeit Milner of Data for Black Lives, Jaron Lanier, Cindy Cohn, Cory Doctorow, and Richard Thieme. Conference participants communicated primarily using the first year appearance of HOPE&#x27;s own Matrix chat server.

=== 2021 canceled plan ===
An in-person HOPE conference was planned for summer 2021, breaking from the typical biennial conference interval, but was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

=== A New HOPE ===

The 14th conference, A New Hope, was held at St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, New York City from 22-24 July 2022. The event was a hybrid event, combining a virtual online event with the in-person event in New York, using Matrix combined with video streaming of the talks.

The keynote was a conversation between Facebook whistleblower Sophie Zhang and Yan Zhu.

Further notable occurrences:
* Munira Mohamed &amp; Chris Weiland, activist citizens: talk entitled &quot;Hacking Local Politics: How We Banned Facial Recognition in Minneapolis&quot;
* Cory Doctorow, author and EFF activist: talk entitled &quot;Seize the Means of Computation&quot;
* Marcia K Wilbur, developer, maker, advocate and author: Hosted &quot;AIOT Village&quot; complete with 3D printer, robotics materials (arduino), raspberry pi units and much more.

=== HOPE XV ===
The 15th conference was held at St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, New York City from 12-14 July 2024.
* Cory Doctorow gave a talk on &quot;enshittification&quot;
* Johannes Grenzfurthner hosted the US premiere of his documentary &quot;Hacking at Leaves&quot; at the conference.

<text>Frederick Richard Dimbleby (25 May 1913 – 22 December 1965) was an English journalist and broadcaster, who became the BBC&#x27;s first war correspondent, and then its leading TV news commentator.

As host of the long-running current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, he pioneered a popular style of interviewing that was respectful but searching. At formal public events, he could combine gravitas with creative insights based on extensive research. He was also able to maintain interest throughout the all-night election specials.

The annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture was founded in his memory.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dimbleby was born near Richmond, Surrey, the son of Gwendoline Mabel (Bolwell) and Frederick Jabez George Dimbleby (d.1943), a journalist. 

He was educated at Glengorse Preparatory School in Eastbourne, then at The Mall School, Twickenham, and then at Mill Hill School, and began his career in 1931 on the &quot;Richmond and Twickenham Times&quot;, which his grandfather, Frederick William Dimbleby, had acquired in 1894. Richard&#x27;s father had been press officer for the Ministry of Labour under David Lloyd George and held a position with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on Fleet Street, but had fallen out over interwar views on fascism and instead joined the family firm.

He then worked as a news reporter on the &quot;Southern Evening Echo&quot; in Southampton, before joining the BBC as a radio news reporter in 1936 on a salary of £360 per annum, going on to cover the first Royal tour of Canada,

In 1938 he was the reporter who covered the infamous &quot;Peace in our Time&quot; story when Chamberlain returned from Berlin. This was one of the first broadcasts done on both radio and television.

===War career===
Dimbleby was the BBC&#x27;s first war correspondent. This was broadcast on radio only as television transmissions were closed down for the duration of the war. He accompanied the British Expeditionary Force to France and made broadcasts from the front. He later covered the battle of El Alamein and the Normandy beaches during the D-Day landings.

During the Second World War, he flew on some twenty raids as an observer with RAF Bomber Command, including a sortie on 16 January 1943 to Berlin piloted by Guy Gibson. On the raids he recorded commentary for broadcast the following day. He was one of the first journalists to experiment with unconventional outside broadcasts, such as when flying in a de Havilland Mosquito accompanying a fighter aircraft raid on France, or being submerged in a diving suit.

On 1 November 1944 he accompanied a &quot;pathfinder&quot; RAF mission of Lancasters and Halifaxes, dropping coloured flares onto central Cologne to aid the following main bomb attack. On 25 March 1945 he accompanied a mission towing gliders over the Rhine, during which heavy losses were sustained. Such live broadcasts were not only dangerous, but had some potential to backfire.

In April 1945, as the BBC&#x27;s war correspondent, he accompanied the British 11th Armoured Division to the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp making one of the first reports. His description of what he saw there was so graphic the BBC declined to broadcast his despatch for four days, relenting only when he threatened to resign. An edited version was eventually aired, with references to Jews removed:

He described, in another broadcast, the wrecked interior of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Reich Chancellery at the war&#x27;s end.

===Later broadcasting career===
When Richard concluded his war correspondent work for the BBC he was earning £1000 a year. The BBC forbade any external directorships while on their permanent staff so technically he resigned, however, he thereafter remained a permanent freelance, greatly increasing his earnings. He acquired full control of his family&#x27;s newspapers, buying out his uncle, Percy Dimbleby. He also obtained a three year contract to write film scripts for Alexander Korda but this was never put to use. His first television broadcast was as a support to Freddie Grisewood to cover the Victory Day celebrations on 7 June 1946, which role he had specifically requested to the head of he BBC, Maurice Gorham.

After the war, Dimbleby switched to television, eventually becoming the BBC&#x27;s leading news commentator. He is perhaps best remembered as the commentator on a number of major public occasions, including the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and the funerals of George VI, John F. Kennedy and Winston Churchill. He wrote a book about the coronation, &quot;Elizabeth Our Queen&quot;, which was given free to many schoolchildren at the time. He also wrote a London crime novel, &quot;Storm at the Hook&quot;, published in 1948.

He oversaw the first live international broadcast, as part of the centenary celebration of the first telegram being sent between France and England. Using the same underwater cable in the Channel on 28 August Dimbleby broadcast from outside Calais town hall. Thereafter he took part in the first Eurovision television relay in 1951 and appeared in the first live television broadcast from the Soviet Union in 1961. He also introduced a special programme in July 1962 showing the first live television signal from the United States via the Telstar satellite. In addition to heavyweight journalism, he took part in lighter sound radio programmes such as &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; (as a panel member) and &quot;Down Your Way&quot; (which he hosted).

From 1955, he was the host of the flagship current affairs series &quot;Panorama&quot;. This programme saw him use his journalistic skills to full advantage in conducting searching, but polite interviews with key figures of the day, while acting as an urbane presenter for the programme. He was able to maintain his reporting talents by visiting places like Berlin, standing in front of the Brandenburg Gate a week before the Berlin Wall was erected across it by the communist authorities of East Germany.

In 1958 Dimbleby was the commentator on the BBC&#x27;s first ever broadcast from the House of Lords.

He made two return trips to Belsen at the BBC&#x27;s request; firstly in the summer of 1959 as part of a documentrary &quot;After the Battle&quot; following six correspondents in their previous footsteps; and in 1965, which also took in the huge nearby military camp at Hohne by which time the Bergen memorial had been set up.

Dimbleby&#x27;s reputation was built upon his ability to describe events clearly yet with a sense of the drama and poetry of the many state occasions he covered. Examples included the lying-in-state of George VI in Westminster Hall, where he depicted the stillness of the guardsmen standing like statues at the four corners of the catafalque, or the description of the drums at Kennedy&#x27;s funeral which, he said, &quot;beat as the pulse of a man&#x27;s heart.&quot; His commentary for the funeral of Churchill in January 1965 was the last state event he commentated upon.

To produce his commentaries, he carried out encyclopaedic research on all aspects of the venues of great events, their history and that of the ceremonies taking place, and the personalities involved. This was a necessary part of radio commentary, which transferred well to television coverage. He could also improvise extensively if there were delays in the schedule. His audience always felt that they were in &quot;safe hands&quot;, especially in &quot;Panorama&quot; programmes like the one dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Inevitably, because of his close association with establishment figures and royalty, some people criticised his &quot;hushed tones&quot; style of speaking at state occasions, claiming he was pompous. In an interview, he laughed off such attacks, explaining that even though he had to use a special microphone, which covered his mouth to obviate his speaking disrupting the solemn atmosphere, he still had to pitch his voice low to avoid his voice carrying. A more common touch was demonstrated in his friendly broadcasts like &quot;Down Your Way&quot; where he met thousands of ordinary people in towns and villages, and the many trade unionists, politicians and industrialists etc. who appeared on &quot;Panorama&quot; and other programmes. Dimbleby also showed stamina and imperturbability in marathon election night broadcasts which ran from 10pm, when the polls closed, until around 6 or 7am the following morning.

===Controversy and comedy===
During his time with &quot;Panorama&quot;, Dimbleby narrated the spaghetti-tree hoax on 1 April 1957, as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke.

After commentating for half an hour on Elizabeth II&#x27;s state visit in 1965 to Germany, Dimbleby uttered the mild expletive, &quot;Jesus wept,&quot; unaware that the microphone was live, after discovering that the TV pictures had failed for all 30 minutes, meaning he would have to repeat the commentary.

==Private life and honours==
Dimbleby married Dilys Thomas in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 1937. Dilys had been a reporter in the family newspaper firm and was the third daughter of a London barrister.

The couple had four children, two of whom, David and Jonathan, have followed in his footsteps to become major broadcasting figures in their own right, both hosting election night broadcasts (David on the BBC, Jonathan on ITN). In addition, Dimbleby&#x27;s third son, Nicholas, sculpted the plaque in his father&#x27;s name that was placed in Poets&#x27; Corner in 1990. They also had a daughter, Sally. Dilys Dimbleby died in 2009.

In June 1946, Dimbleby was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services as a war correspondent. In the 1959 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

==Death and legacy==

On 22 December 1965, Dimbleby died at the age of 52. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 4 January 1966, led by Dr Eric Abbott, Dean of Westminster and Dr George Reindorp, Bishop of Guildford. The plaque to his memory stands in the south aisle of the abbey.

He had been suffering from testicular cancer which had been diagnosed five years earlier. In 1962 he had presented a documentary on the links between heavy tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Dimbleby decided to reveal he was ill with cancer, which, at the time, was a taboo disease to mention. It was helpful in building public consciousness of the disease and investing more resources in finding a cure. The Richard Dimbleby Cancer Fund was founded in his memory. Dimbleby was cremated, the ceremony receiving national publicity.

In 1986 &quot;Celebration of a Broadcaster&quot;, commemorating Dimbleby, was held in Westminster Abbey. In April 2013, he was honoured by the Royal Mail, as one of six people selected as subjects for the &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.
