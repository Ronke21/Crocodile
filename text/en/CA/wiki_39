<doc id="767863" wikidata="Q1190010" url="?curid=767863" title="Kogoro Akechi">
<text>is a fictional private detective created by Japanese mystery writer Edogawa Ranpo.

==Overview==
Akechi first appeared in the story in January 1925 and continued to appear in stories for a quarter of a century. Edogawa Ranpo (a pseudonym for Tarō Hirai) is considered the father of the Japanese detective story and was a great admirer of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Akechi is the first recurring detective character in Japanese fiction and is clearly inspired by Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes.

Like Holmes, Akechi is a brilliant but eccentric detective who consults with the police on especially difficult cases. He is a master of disguise and an expert at judo whose genius lets him solve seemingly impossible cases. Also like Holmes, Akechi makes use of a group of young boys to gather information. His version of the Baker Street Irregulars is known as the . Akechi smokes Egyptian cigarettes when he is thinking about a case.

Kogoro Akechi is a tall, handsome man with heavy eyebrows who dresses well. He is married to a woman named and lives with , the leader of the Boy Detectives Club. Kobayashi often plays an important part in solving cases. Like his mentor, he is an expert at disguise and is especially adept at posing as a young woman. Aside from these relationships little is known of the detective&#x27;s personal life, which always takes a back seat to the mystery in his adventures.

Detective Akechi&#x27;s most frequent foe is the infamous . The fiend is a master criminal whose infallible gift for disguise may have been inspired by Hamilton Cleek, Thomas W. Hanshew&#x27;s heroic but amoral &quot;Man of Forty Faces.&quot; The Fiend is a non-violent criminal who steals to demonstrate his brilliance rather than out of need for money. He and Akechi have a mutual respect in the stories.

The Akechi stories are based mainly in the detective&#x27;s home city of Tokyo, though some move the action to the Japanese countryside. The stories often feature supernatural and erotic overtones, though not so much as Ranpo&#x27;s other fiction.

==In popular culture==
Akechi has become a fixture in Japanese pop-culture. There have been a number of movies made based on his adventures, some of which pit him against other fictional characters such as Arsène Lupin. The actor best known for playing the detective is Eiji Okada. Akechi has been featured as a character in the manga &quot;Lupin III&quot; (and its anime pilot) and references to him are common in Japanese fiction. He is probably best known in the west through the 1994 movie, &quot;Rampo&quot;.

Another notable movie featuring Akechi is the 1968 film &quot;Black Lizard&quot;, directed by Kinji Fukasaku. The movie was adapted from Ranpo&#x27;s novel of the same name by noted author Yukio Mishima, who also appears briefly in the film. The story pits the detective against a female mastermind, known as the Black Lizard, who is played by cross-dressing actor Akihiro Miwa. The film is considered high camp with its bizarre conventions and over-the-top performances but has a loyal following among fans and critics alike.

Modern references to him can also be found in Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s popular and long-running manga series, &quot;Detective Conan&quot;. One of the characters, Detective Kogoro Mori is a persistent and courageous yet highly flawed and lecherous private detective—almost a parody of Kogoro Akechi. He has his cases solved for him by the youthful main character, Conan Edogawa. The name of young Conan&#x27;s elementary school detective club is the &quot;Detective Boys&quot;. Akechi himself is highlighted in volume 2 of the manga, in &quot;Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s Mystery Library&quot;, a section of the graphic novels (usually the last page) where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from literature. Further Akechi references can be seen in Aoyama&#x27;s other series, &quot;Magic Kaito&quot;, where a master thief steals high profile items for recognition.

Both Akechi and the Black Lizard are referenced in the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series of video games and anime. One of the musicals performed by the Teikoku Kagekidan is &quot;Benitokage&quot; (&quot;Crimson Lizard&quot;) and features the title character, a criminal femme fatale, along with a handsome young detective named Akechi Kojiro. The manga and anime Nijū Mensō no Musume, or the Daughter of Twenty Faces, focuses heavily on Akechi&#x27;s arch-rival. Akechi himself is featured as well, but as a much more minor character. Akechi is also referenced in the character of Police Superintendent Akechi Kengo in &quot;Kindaichi Case Files&quot;, a popular detective manga series. In the media franchise, &quot;Tantei Opera Milky Holmes&quot;, Akechi is represented by a girl police detective named Kokoro Akechi.

In 2015, a new Anime series entitled &quot;Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace&quot; has been created, based on the Mystery novels of Edogawa Ranpo, and in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his death. The story follows Kobayashi (a reference to the leader of the Boy Detectives) who becomes assistant to eccentric 17 year old Akechi. In this Anime Twenty Faces also makes an appearance as a vigilante serial killer.
In October 2016, an Anime titled, &quot;Trickster: From Edogawa Ranpo&#x27;s &quot;The Boy Detectives Club&quot;&quot; was made, based on the stories of the &#x27;Boy&#x27;s Detective Club&#x27;. The plot follows Kogorou Akechi who meets mysterious Yoshio Kobayashi. Kobayashi, who has an undying body because of an &quot;unidentified fog,&quot; wishes his own death, but together they both make their way after a mysterious criminal, nicknamed the &quot;Fiend with Twenty Faces&quot;. The Anime takes place in the future period of the 2030s.

Goro Akechi, a character in the 2016 video game &quot;Persona 5,&quot; is a deliberate homage to this character, even down to the name. His early role in the game, as a celebrity detective who opposes the Phantom Thieves (especially their leader, whose Persona takes the name of the original Lupin), mirrors especially the original Akechi&#x27;s role in Edogawa&#x27;s works. Also of note his role in the overall story of the game, combined with the protagonist&#x27;s ability to change Personas serves as an homage to the rivalry between Akechi and the Fiend with Twenty Faces.

In 2013 and 2014 a pair of films were made pairing Akechi with another famous fictional Japanese detective Seishi Yokomizo&#x27;s Kosuke Kindaichi. Hideaki Itô was Akechi, whilst Tomohisa Yamashita played Kindaichi.

<doc id="767881" wikidata="Q1411645" url="?curid=767881" title="Shane MacGowan and The Popes">
<text>The Popes are a band originally formed by Shane MacGowan (of the Pogues) and Paul &quot;Mad Dog&quot; McGuinness, who play a blend of rock, Irish folk and Americana.

Shane MacGowan and the Popes released two studio and one live album in the 1990s, performing live together until 2005. During this era, the Popes also recorded and gigged on their own until 2006. At the end of 2006, guitarist Paul &quot;Mad Dog&quot; McGuinness reformed the band with a new lineup and leads it to this day.

==History==
===1992–1998: Shane MacGowan and the Popes===
After departing the Pogues, singer Shane MacGowan put together a new band, started with a group of people from the Pogues&#x27; extended family including Paul &quot;Mad Dog&quot; McGuinness and Tommy McManamon.

McGuinness and Tom Gerry McManamon formed the core of the band, on guitar and tenor banjo respectively. Soundman Dave Jordon and road manager Big Charlie MacLennan also followed MacGowan to the Popes. Joining them were guitarist Mo O&#x27;Hagan and bass player Bernie France, who had both played with MacGowan in a short-lived group called the London Contemporary Five (France was also an old friend and one-time teenage bandmate of MacGowan&#x27;s, in the group Hot Dogs With Everything). Ex-Exploited and Boothill Foot Tappers drummer Danny Heatly and whistle player Colm O&#x27;Maonlai rounded out the original group.

It was this lineup that Johnny Depp joined appearing with them on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and other music shows. He directed and appeared in the video of &quot;That Woman&#x27;s Got Me Drinking&quot;.

Of this initial line-up, only McGuinness and McManamon would last the entirety of Shane MacGowan&#x27;s tenure with the group. France was replaced by Bob Dowling on bass, Heatley left later, to be replaced by Andy Ireland.

===1998–2006: The Popes===
As well as backing MacGowan both live and on his solo albums, the McGuinness–McManamon incarnation of The Popes recorded a few singles and one studio album, &quot;Holloway Boulevard&quot;, released in March 2000. A live album, &quot;Release The Beast (Live in London 2003)&quot;, followed in 2004.

Producer and sound man Dave Jordan died of a heroin overdose in Paris while on the road with the band in March 1995, followed in October 1996 by Charlie MacLennan, who died of a drug-induced heart attack. Ten years later, the long battle with illness from liver disease and subsequent death on 15 December 2006 of founding member Tom McManamon (born on 30 May 1961 in London, England) would put an end to Shane MacGowan and the Popes. 
The Popes played their final show with MacGowan on 17 March 2005, and had disintegrated by the time of McManamon&#x27;s death in December 2006.

===2006–present: The Popes reformed===
Following the death of banjo player Tommy McManamon at the end of 2006, Paul McGuinness reformed The Popes with a new album in the works and a new line-up including Charlie Hoskyns (Lisa Knapp, Badly Mixed Bastards) on guitar, Will Morrison (Here be Dragons, Lisa Knapp) on drums, Laurie Norwood on bass and Ben Gunnery on fiddle.

The album was eventually released in 2009 as &quot;Outlaw Heaven&quot;, featuring Fiachra Shanks on mandolin and guitar and Shane MacGowan as a guest vocalist on three songs, (vocals recorded by Fiachra Shanks) with Pogue Spider Stacy joining MacGowan and McGuinness on vocals on the title track.

The line-up changed once again with the arrival of Jim McAllister on bass, Dave Allen on fiddle and Whiskey Mick Rowan on mandolin.

The band toured internationally before releasing a follow-up in 2012, &quot;New Church&quot;. The album was followed by another tour including dates opening for the Stranglers. Shortly after the release of &quot;New Church&quot;, Charlie Hoskyns left the band and was replaced by Ian Bramble on guitar and backing vocals. Jim McAllister also left the band and was replaced by Greg Courtney on bass.

During 2012 and 2013, this lineup of the Popes toured extensively in Europe and Australia. A new album with new material written by Paul McGuinness and the new line-up, and previous material telling the story of the Popes, was planned for 2014, although the band has been on an extended hiatus due to a brain injury suffered by McGuinness in November 2013 (see next section below).

==Later activities==
A memorial for McManamon in March 2007 saw Bob Dowling, Andy Ireland, and Brian Kelly reunite as the Popes, joined by Miriam Kavana and Denis Dowling.

Accordion player Andy Nolan went on to join the BibleCode Sundays.

Banjo player Brian Kelly went on to join Creeds Cross, and released two instrumental records under his own name.

Violinist Dave Allen and guitarist Ian Bramble released a Christmas song and an album with John Coghlan.

Drummer Will Morrison has played in Welsh band Here Be Dragons.

In November 2013, Paul McGuinness suffered a serious head injury that left him hospitalized for months. As of 8 June 2014, he was still residing in the brain injury rehabilitation unit at Homerton Hospital.

<doc id="767887" wikidata="Q1362801" url="?curid=767887" title="Chrysler Horizon">
<text>The Talbot Horizon is a compact hatchback designed by Chrysler Europe, manufactured and marketed for model years 1978-1987 under the Simca, Chrysler and Talbot brands, succeeding both the Simca 1100 and Hillman Avenger, and using a front-wheel drive, transverse-engine layout.

Though the Hillman Avenger had been developed with global marketing in mind, the results had been less than successful. The Horizon became Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s first successful world car, with the Chrysler Europe project developed in tandem with the American-market Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon. While similar in appearance, and in one case even sharing a model name, the European and American Horizons differed substantially.

==Origins==
The Horizon was developed by Chrysler Europe under the codename C2 in the United Kingdom at the Whitley design studio. Designed by Roy Axe and engineered in France at Poissy by Simca as a replacement for their ageing 1100 range — as well as the Hillman Avenger. Introduced to market in summer 1978, it was initially marketed in France under the Simca brand, while elsewhere in Europe it was initially badged as a Chrysler. As a result of the acquisition of Chrysler&#x27;s European car division by Peugeot in 1978, both the Chrysler and Simca brands were dropped and the car was subsequently marketed under the Talbot brand in all its European markets.


The Horizon was intended to be a &quot;world car&quot; designed for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, but in execution, the European and North American versions of the vehicle differed substantially. Born largely out of the need to replace the ageing Simca 1100 and Hillman Avenger, the Horizon was essentially a shortened version of the larger Alpine model, giving the vehicle an unusually wide track for its length. Featuring transversely mounted Simca-designed 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5-litre &quot;Poissy&quot; OHV engines, 4-speed gearboxes, and torsion-bar suspension, the Horizon was praised for its crisp styling, supple ride, and competent handling.

The SX version which joined the range for the Paris Motor Show, in October 1978, attracted interest for its innovative trip computer. The device took information from three sources, a clock, a &quot;débitmètre&quot; mounted on the fuel feed to the carburetor, and distance information from the feed for the odometer. Using these three pieces of information the &quot;computer&quot; was able to report current fuel consumption and average speeds as well as information on distances and times, in either metric or imperial units. The trip computer later became an option on lesser models such as the GLS.
The Horizon was voted European Car of the Year in 1979. Initially only available in LS or GL trim, its launch saw the end of the rear-engined Simca 1000. The Simca 1100 remained in production in France until 1981, being sold for a time as a low cost alternative to the Horizon, but the two cars competed in virtually the same segment and the older car, its model range drastically reduced, saw its sales plummet. On the British market, the rear-wheel drive Avenger saloons and estates remained in production alongside it, giving British buyers a full choice of bodystyles in a market where hatchbacks still only accounted for a minority of sales. There was never a three-door version of the Horizon. To fill this niche, the Simca 1100 remained on sale in continental Europe, while the rear-wheel drive Chrysler Sunbeam was sold alongside the Horizon in the United Kingdom until 1981.

In the end, the Horizon overlapped rather than replaced the British-designed rear-drive Sunbeam and Hillman Avenger models, which had been on sale since 1970, their production ending in 1981.

==Production life==
After Chrysler Europe collapsed in 1978 and was sold to Peugeot, the Horizon was rebadged as a Talbot in 1979.

In 1981, the revisited models were introduced with minor improvements. By then however, the Horizon was becoming increasingly uncompetitive next to rivals such as the Volkswagen Golf (which was actually four years older), Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra and third generation Ford Escort. The unrefined overhead-valve engines carried over from the Simca 1100 were largely to blame, while body corrosion was a serious issue – at least until the Series II – giving many cars a short service life.
The series 2 Horizon launched in July 1982 had a 5-speed gearbox, and was badged &quot;series II 5 speed&quot;. The bumpers were painted black and the backlite was smaller, because the parcel shelf was raised to increase the size of the boot. Some models featured an electronic LED &#x27;econometer&#x27; which illuminated several lights around the edge of the speedometer dial. An LED tachometer was available on higher trim levels, the horizontal row of green, yellow, and red LEDs positioned above the steering column, illuminating in 250 rpm intervals.

The Horizon was updated again in 1985, with revised interior trim, instrument dials and door cards. Along with the Fiat Ritmo/Strada, the Horizon became one of the oldest mainstream family hatchback on sale in Europe, and faced enormous competition.

Fewer paint colours and trim levels became available and many examples manufactured between 1985 and 1986, were painted in an unsympathetic pale green or cream — contrasting sharply with the adventurous colors at its introduction.

A Talbot Horizon turbo concept car was produced in 1984 with a full cream leather interior and sporty body kit, the car was designed at Whitley, Coventry. The Turbo Horizon is very different from those models once seen out on the street and is kept at Coventry Transport Museum, Coventry England.

Due to corrosion issues, Horizons remaining in use are rare, with just 20 examples still on the road in the UK at the end of 2016.

The Horizon was manufactured primarily at Poissy in France and PSA Ryton Assembly in England. British manufacture commenced on 4 January 1982, and soon thereafter the Ryton plant was working a full five-day week for the first time in sixteen months. At the time, British Horizons had 60% British parts content. It was also manufactured in Spain in Villaverde by PSA Peugeot Citroën&#x27;s Spanish subsidiary, and in Finland by Saab-Valmet from 1979 onwards. Finnish-manufactured Talbot Horizons integrated many Saab components, especially in the interior and electrical system. The Saab-Valmet factory also made a series of 2,385 cars that ran on kerosene or turpentine.

The Horizon was manufactured in France and also Britain (where production had begun in the 1980s) until June 1986, and in Spain and Finland until 1987. Its successor was the Peugeot 309, a car developed in the UK and launched towards the end of 1985, originally destined to be sold as the Talbot Arizona. The end of Horizon production early in 1987 also marked the end of the Talbot badge on passenger cars. North American variants continued in production until 1990.

The PSA XUD9 diesel engine of 1905 cc diesel engine was fitted to certain models of the Horizon, which was the first example of this engine available in the UK. All UK-market diesel Horizons were made in Spain. The British Peugeot-Talbot brochure of October 1984 shows the only diesel Horizon being the LD 1.9, the XUD9 engine only available in the Peugeot 305 GRD as well. The Horizon was not the first diesel in the Talbot family of cars with the Chrysler 180 in Spain having been available with diesel power during the 1970s.

The Peugeot 309 used some of the Horizon range of Simca-based engines for most of its production life, until replaced with the more modern Peugeot TU engine in 1992.

==Horizon in the UK==
In Britain, the Horizon was seen as a modern alternative to the existing Rootes-designed Avenger models, offering buyers a front-wheel drive hatchback alongside the rear-wheel drive saloons and estates. The Avenger was marketed alongside the Horizon until 1981, by which time the company had come under Peugeot ownership and no new models were launched to replace it, as the front-wheel drive hatchback style was becoming more popular and Peugeot already had the similar-sized 305 saloon and estates in production.

UK sales of the Horizon (which went on sale there in early 1978 and was badged as a Chrysler until 1 August 1979, when it became a Talbot) were initially acceptable, held back by the fact that it was a French import. Sales improved as manufacture was brought to the United Kingdom in 1982. Soon thereafter, however, it started to lose sales in a segment dominated by an increasing number of newer models including the Ford Escort Mark III, Vauxhall Astra, and Austin Maestro. Foreign models like the Volkswagen Golf and Datsun Sunny were also proving popular in the early 1980s.

The last British Horizons were marketed in 1986, soon after the launch of Peugeot&#x27;s Ryton-built 309 which had originally been intended for sale as the Talbot Arizona, as a Talbot-branded successor to the Horizon, and went on sale in January 1986. The 309 continued the Simca heritage by using Simca-derived engines in its smaller models.

The Ryton factory remained open until December 2006.

== UK Specifications range==
==Models==
The UK Horizon was available in the following trim levels:
* 1100 LE, LS, GL, GLE
* 1300 LS, GL, LX, GLS
* 1500 LS, GL, EX, GLS, S, SX
* 1900 LD

Most models were available with 4 or 5-speed gearboxes, which were initially a carry-over of the Simca gearbox, and then later the PSA BE gearbox. An automatic transmission was available on most 1500 models, and was standard equipment on the 1500 SX model. The lowest level LE had very meagre equipment, not even being fitted with a rear parcel shelf.

Some limited editions were:

* 1500 &quot;Pullman&quot; top of range model. This had upmarket trim and a design of alloy wheel similar to the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus and a wider tyre. The Pullman also had radio upgrade with 4 speakers, and rear seatbelts. Most had beige over brown metallic, two-tone paintwork. Around 20% of the Pullman models were two tone silver and blue.
* 1300 &quot;Summertime Special&quot; This had red plastic trim in place of the usual black.
* 1500/1300 &quot;Ultra&quot; (1985) an upmarket high-spec car in silver metallic, had its name &#x27;ULTRA&#x27; on the front wings in black lettering. Ultra had grey velour interior with red piping. The Ultra had been sold in the Netherlands since 1983.
* 1500 &quot;Silver Fox&quot; which had two tone paintwork half silver, half blue metallic.

==Group B Talbot Horizon==
In 1982 Talbot and Lotus Cars began work on a Group B rally car meant to succeed the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus. Based on the Talbot Horizon, the car was fitted with a mid-mounted Lotus type 911 engine driving the rear wheels. The project was cancelled after two prototypes had been built. Peugeot subsequently began development of their all-wheel drive 205 T16.

==North American variants==
North American deritvatives of the Horizon were marketed as the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon, which featured substantial differences despite very similar appearances. External bodywork was in fact not interchangeable, nor were engines, North American models using a larger engine (of VW, then PSA origins on the early versions, replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s own 2.2L OHC &quot;Trenton&quot; I-4 later) and MacPherson strut suspension at the front instead of the more complex torsion bar system found in the European version. U.S. derivatives also featured larger reinforced aluminum bumpers in compliance with US safety legislation. Despite the car&#x27;s European origins, then Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca played this down, emphasizing that features such as the trip computer and electronic ignition, of American design.

In the US, numerous variants were eventually offered, including a three-door hatchback versions (&quot;Charger&quot; and &quot;TC-3 / Turismo&quot;); economy trim levels (&quot;America&quot;, &quot;Miser&quot;); high power versions (GLH, GLH Turbo, and Shelby GLHS) — as well as a pickup truck variant (&quot;Scamp&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot;).

<doc id="767888" wikidata="Q710842" url="?curid=767888" title="John N. Bahcall">
<text>John Norris Bahcall (December 30, 1934 – August 17, 2005) was an American astrophysicist and the Richard Black Professor for Astrophysics at the Institute for Advanced Study. He was known for a wide range of contributions to solar, galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, including the solar neutrino problem, the development of the Hubble Space Telescope and for his leadership and development of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

==Early life and education==
Bahcall was born into a Jewish family in Shreveport, Louisiana on December 30, 1934, and would later describe an early aspiration to become a Reform rabbi. He did not take science classes at high school. In high school he was a state tennis champion and a national debate champion (1952). 

Bahcall began his university studies at Louisiana State University as a philosophy student on a tennis scholarship, where he considered pursuing the rabbinate. At the end of his freshmen year, he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, still studying philosophy. He took his first physics class to fulfill a graduation science requirement, later saying:

Bahcall switched majors to physics, and graduated with an AB in Physics from Berkeley in 1956. He obtained his MS in physics in 1957 from the University of Chicago and his PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1961.
He spent a year as a research fellow in physics with Emil Konopinski at Indiana University. From 1962 to 1970, he worked with a group led by William Fowler at the Kellogg Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. first as a research fellow and later as an Assistant and Associate Professor.

==Academic career==
Bahcall joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1968 becoming a professor of natural sciences in 1971 and the Richard Black Professor of Natural Sciences in 1997. 

Bahcall became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1976. 
He was president of the American Astronomical Society from 1990 to 1992, and was president-elect of the American Physical Society at the date of his death.

==Research==
Bahcall published over six hundred scientific papers and wrote or edited nine books on astrophysics.
Bahcall is most notable for his work in establishing the standard solar model. He spent much of his life pursuing the solar neutrino problem with physical chemist Raymond Davis, Jr. Together, Davis and Bahcall collaborated on the Homestake Experiment. To test Bahcall&#x27;s theoretical predictions, Davis created an underground detector for neutrinos in a South Dakota gold mine, essentially a large tank filled with cleaning fluid. The flux of neutrinos found by the detector was one-third the amount theoretically predicted by Bahcall, a discrepancy that took over thirty years to resolve. Bahcall&#x27;s ongoing research in this area resulted in publication of his book, &quot;Neutrino Astrophysics&quot; (1989), considered a standard reference on solar neutrinos.

The 2002 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Davis and Masatoshi Koshiba for their pioneering work in observing the neutrinos predicted from Bahcall&#x27;s solar model, thereby vindicating Bahcall&#x27;s prediction.

In addition to his work on solar neutrinos, Bahcall collaborated with Eli Waxman on the Waxman-Bahcall bound for high energy neutrinos. This bound sets a limit on high energy neutrino flux based on the observed flux of high energy cosmic rays. It was not possible to verify this prediction until after his death, with the construction of neutrino telescopes capable of detecting very high energy neutrinos, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

Another contribution of Bahcall to astrophysics was the development and implementation of the Hubble Space Telescope, in collaboration with Lyman Spitzer, Jr., from the 1970s through to the period after the telescope was launched in 1990. 
In 1992, Bahcall received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for this work. He reintroduced the traditional method of star counts, as a quantitative tool for assessing galactic structure. 

The standard model of a galaxy, with a massive black hole surrounded by stars, is known as the Bahcall-Wolf model. The Bahcall-Soneira model was for many years the standard model for the structure of the Milky Way. He also contributed to accurate astrophysical models of stellar interiors.

Bahcall married Princeton University astrophysics professor Neta Bahcall, whom he met as a graduate student at the Weizmann Institute in the 1960s. They had a daughter and two sons (including Safi Bahcall). He died in New York on 17 August 2005 from a rare blood disorder.

<text>A grand coalition is an arrangement in a multi-party parliamentary system in which the two largest political parties of opposing political ideologies unite in a coalition government.

==Causes of a grand coalition==
Occasionally circumstances arise in which normally opposing parties may find it desirable to form a government together. For example, in a national crisis such as a war or depression, people may feel a need for national unity and stability that overcomes ordinary ideological differences. This is especially true when there is broad agreement about the best policy to deal with the crisis. In this case, a grand coalition may occur even when one party has enough seats to govern alone. An example would be the British national governments during World War I and before and during World War II.

Another possibility is that the major parties may find they have more in common ideologically with each other than with the smaller parties. This is often a result of a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, where the mainstream parties of the left and right form a coalition to keep parties of the far left or far right out of government. One such example is Austria, which had grand coalitions from 1945 to 1966 to this effect. It is also possible that so many parties are represented in parliament that no other coalition is stable. This is often done out of political necessity, to prevent an early election. For example, in Israel, the fragmentation and intransigence of some of the smaller parties has made it easier to maintain a coherent platform with a grand coalition than with a narrow one.

==Africa==

===Tunisia===

Ennahda Party made an alliance with the parties of opposing political ideologies, and governed Tunisia between 2011 and 2021.

After the party won the Constituent Assembly election in 2011, an alliance was established with the second-placed party (Congress for the Republic) and the third-placed party (Ettakatol), forming the Troika alliance.
In the 2014 parliamentary election, the party came in second place, but it formed alliance with Nidaa Tounes which was in first place, despite the tensions in the electoral campaign.
In the 2019 parliamentary election, the party returned to first place and allied with the Heart of Tunisia party, until the 2021 political crisis.

===South Africa===

The 2024 elections in the Republic of South Africa resulted in the African National Congress (ANC), which had been in power since 1994, losing its majority having received less than 41% of the national vote. The ANC formed a grand coalition with the Democratic Alliance (previously the official opposition) and nine other parties. Together the parties had 72% of seats in the South African Parliament. All parties who were prepared to sign a statement of intent, which contained the main principles for what it called the Government of National Unity (GNU), were included.

==Asia==

===India===

In the Indian state of Maharashtra, the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance was formed between the Indian National Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena after the 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election. While the Congress and the NCP reflect centre to centre-left policies and have a secular ideology, the Shiv Sena reflects right-wing policies and has a Hindu-nationalist ideology. The alliance formed the government in Maharashtra after a political crisis. The government lasted for 2.5 years, after which in 2022 a rebellion occurred in Shiv Sena regarding the alliance and another political crisis followed. After the government collapsed, the Shiv Sena split into two factions; the relatively moderate and secular group Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) (SS (UBT)) led by Uddhav Thackeray and the Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena, the Hindu nationalist group led by Eknath Shinde. The alliance still exists between the Congress, the NCP and the SS (UBT), though they sit in the opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.

===Israel===

Israel has had several grand coalition governments. The first was the wartime government of Levi Eshkol, formed in 1967 and which lasted until 1970. Subsequent grand coalitions were formed in the 1980s and at several points in the 21st century.

Several of Israel&#x27;s grand coalitions were rotation governments, in which the premiership alternated between center-left and center-right leaders. The first was from 1984 to 1988, led by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir (which was continued as a non-rotation grand coalition until 1990). In 2021, a rotation grand coalition government, the Bennett-Lapid government, succeeded another rotation grand coalition in the form of the Netanyahu-Gantz government.

===Japan===

Following the 1993 Japanese general elections, the historically hegemonic Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was narrowly placed into the opposition in the lower house for the first time in its history. The former opposition, consisting of parties ranging from the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) to the neoconservative Japan Renewal Party, united around Morihiro Hosokawa as their choice for prime minister. After having passed electoral reform legislation, which was the coalition&#x27;s , the bickering between ideological factions led to the grand coalition falling apart less than a year later. Soon afterwards, in 1994, the JSP negotiated with the LDP to form a grand coalition government. This lasted until January 1996, and the JSP collapsed after losing much of its political support.

===Malaysia===

The Pakatan Harapan coalition and the Barisan Nasional coalition formed the first grand coalition government in Malaysia in 2022, after the country&#x27;s 15th general election. No major coalition secured enough seats in these elections to secure a simple majority in parliament. Thus, the country had a hung parliament for the first time in its history. A few days after the election, the Conference of Rulers decreed that party leaders must work together to form a government. Pakatan Harapan&#x27;s Prime Minister candidate, Anwar Ibrahim, was sworn in as the country&#x27;s 10th Prime Minister after securing the support of Barisan Nasional, its longstanding opponent, together with other parties that make up the Borneo Bloc: Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) and Warisan. This coalition government is commonly referred to as a Unity Government, even in official communication by the government itself, but this is not a commonly-accepted use of the term. A Unity Government is typically defined as a broad coalition government that lacks opposition. In Malaysia&#x27;s case, the Perikatan Nasional coalition serves as the biggest group in the opposition bloc.

===Mongolia===

Following the election, the ruling Mongolian People&#x27;s Party had been reduced from Supermajority to simple majority for the first time in 8 years. Although The Mongolian People&#x27;s Party could have formed a government of their own, the party leaders of Mongolian People&#x27;s Party, Democratic Party (Mongolia) and HUN Party met and signed a memorandum to cooperate, thus a Grand Coalition in Mongolia is formed for the first time in its history.

=== Turkey ===

Turkey&#x27;s first grand coalition was formed after the 1961 general election, with members of Republican People&#x27;s Party and Justice Party. At the same time, the grand coalition was also Turkey&#x27;s first coalition government.

==Europe==

===Austria===
In post-war Austria, a &quot;grand coalition&quot; () between the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) and the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) has been standard since World War II. Of the 31 governments which have taken office since 1945, 20 have been grand coalitions, including eleven consecutively from 1945 to 1966. Grand coalitions again governed from 1987 to 2000 and 2007 to 2017. Grand coalitions have also been common at the state level: as of July 2020, grand coalitions governed Carinthia, Styria, Lower Austria, and Upper Austria; in the last two of these, grand coalitions (more specifically, all-party government) are compulsory under the constitution.

===Croatia===

The Third Government of the Republic of Croatia () or The Government of National Unity (Croatian: &quot;Vlada nacionalnog jedinstva&quot;) was the Croatian Government cabinet led by Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić. It was announced on 17 July 1991 in response to the escalation of the Croatian War of Independence. It was the 3rd cabinet of Croatia since the first multi-party elections, and its term ended on 12 August 1992 after the first parliamentary election under the 1990 Croatian Constitution. During the term of this cabinet Croatia gained internationally diplomatic recognition and became a member of the United Nations.
The government was dominated by the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union and it contained the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, Croatian Social Liberal Party, Croatian People&#x27;s Party, Croatian Christian Democratic Party, Socialist Party of Croatia, Social Democrats of Croatia and the Croatian Democratic Party

===Czech Republic===
After the Velvet Revolution, there was a government of socialists (ČSSD) with Prime Minister Miloš Zeman supported by the right-wing ODS, known as the opposition agreement.

===Denmark===

After the 2022 Danish general election a grand coalition was formed between the centre-left Social Democrats, the centre-right Venstre and the centrist Moderates, presided over by the social democrat Mette Frederiksen.

===European Union===
In the European Parliament, the two main pan-European party groups are the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D). Until 2019, they held a majority in the European Parliament and worked together in a grand coalition. However, advances by green, liberal and right-wing populist parties across Europe in the 2019 European Parliament election led to the EPP-S&amp;D coalition losing their majority, making Renew Europe support necessary to give Ursula von der Leyen and her commission a majority in the European Parliament.

=== Estonia ===
Kaja Kallas&#x27; first cabinet was a grand coalition between the Reform Party and the Centre Party.

Kallas dismissed the Centre ministers from her cabinet in June 2022, leaving it in a minority.

===Germany===


In post-war Germany, &quot;grand coalition&quot; () refers to a governing coalition of the two largest parties, usually the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). While Germany has historically tended to favour narrow coalitions of one of the two largest parties with the FDP or with the Greens, four grand coalitions have been formed at a federal level: the Kiesinger cabinet (1966–1969), the first Merkel cabinet (2005–2009), the third Merkel cabinet (2013-2018), and the fourth Merkel cabinet (2018–2021).

Under the Weimar Republic, the Great Coalition included all of the major parties of the left, centre, and centre-right who formed the basis of most governments: the SPD, the Catholic Centre Party, the German Democratic Party (DDP), and the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP). The two examples were the first and second Stresemann cabinets (August–November 1923) and, less ephemerally, the second Müller cabinet (1928–1930).

===Greece===
In Greece there had been two Grand Coalitions known in Greece as National Unity Governments. The first one is the Coalition Cabinet of Xenophon Zolotas composed by the right-wing New Democracy (Greece) and the left-wing PASOK and Synaspismos because of a hung parliament and the second one is the Cabinet of Lucas Papademos composed by the right-wing New Democracy and Popular Orthodox Rally and the left-wing PASOK because of the Greek government-debt crisis.
There were also grand coalitions during the governments of Tzannis Tzannetakis (New Democracy and Synaspismos), Antonis Samaras (New Democracy, PASOK and Democratic Left (Greece)) and Alexis Tsipras (Syriza, Independent Greeks and Ecologist Greens)

===Iceland===

In Iceland there was a grand coalition between 30 November 2017 and December 2024 between the largest parties of the centre-right Independence Party (16), the left-wing Left-Green Movement (9), and the liberal agrarian Progressive Party (8). All of the parties are opposed to EU integration.

The coalition collapsed into a minority government after the Left-greens exited the coalition.

===Italy===

In Italy, &quot;grand coalition&quot; () refers to the first supermajority government formed in April 2013 between center-left Democratic Party (PD), center-right The People of Freedom (PdL) party, and the centrist Civic Choice (SC) and Union of the Centre (UdC) parties. In November 2013, The People of Freedom (later renamed as Forza Italia) however dropped out and broke apart, leaving the Letta Cabinet and further Renzi Cabinet (Coalition between PD, NCD, SC and UdC) with a small majority.

===Liechtenstein===
The Patriotic Union and the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party have often governed Liechtenstein together, including the entire period from 1938 to 1997.

===Luxembourg===
In Luxembourg, towards the end of World War I, a new Chamber of Deputies was elected in 1918 with the explicit aim of reviewing the constitution. To this end, formalised parties were formed by the main political blocs, so as to increase their bargaining power in the negotiations. The revisions to the constitution introduced universal suffrage and compulsory voting, adopted proportional representation, and limited the powers of the monarch.

Since the foundation of the party system, only one cabinet (between 1921 and 1925) has included only members of a single party. Most of the time, governments are grand coalitions of the two largest parties, no matter what their ideologies; this has made Luxembourg one of the most stable democracies in the world. Two cabinets (between 1945 and 1947) included members of every party represented in the Chamber of Deputies.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there have been several cabinets which can be described as grand coalitions (). The Roman/Red coalitions of the 1940s and 1950s under Prime Minister Willem Drees were composed of the Christian democratic Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and the social-democratic Labour Party (PvdA) at its core and several smaller parties as backup (Drees–Van Schaik). The Purple coalitions in the 1990s under Prime Minister Wim Kok were between the PvdA, the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the social-liberal Democrats 66 (D66) party (First Kok cabinet). The Second Rutte cabinet, a grand coalition cabinet which can also be described as a purple coalition, was composed of the VVD and the PvdA. A more traditional grand coalition cabinet was the Third Lubbers cabinet, comprising the Christian-democratic Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the PvdA.

===Romania===
After the political crisis in autumn 2021, PNL, PSD and the UDMR reached an agreement to rule the country together for the next seven years. Thus, it has been agreed that the prime minister and several other important ministries should be changed every 18 months. The prime minister appointed was national-liberal Nicolae Ciucă. His cabinet was sworn in on 25 November. The coalition supports the Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

===Spain===
In Spain, the term &quot;grand coalition&quot; is typically used to refer to any hypothetical government formed between the centre-right to right-wing People&#x27;s Party (PP) and the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). No such a coalition government has ever been formed at the national level, though it was proposed by then Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy during the 2015–2016 government formation process. Rajoy&#x27;s own investiture on 29 October 2016 was allowed by the abstention of PSOE&#x27;s MPs, in what was dubbed a &quot;covert grand coalition&quot;, in reference to PSOE&#x27;s tolerance of Rajoy&#x27;s minority government through punctual agreements until the re-election of Pedro Sánchez as party leader in June 2017.

At the regional level, grand coalitions between the two largest parliamentary forces have been rare, but examples exist:
* Basque Country: PNV–PSE, 1986–1990 and 1991–1998.
* Navarre: UPN–PSN, 2011–2012.

Additionally, both PSOE and PP formed a joint coalition government—which also included other parties—following a successful vote of no confidence in the Cantabrian regional government of Juan Hormaechea in 1990, enduring until the 1991 regional election. At the time, however, the PP was not among the two largest political parties in the regional assembly.

=== Switzerland ===

Switzerland is a Directorial Republic, which means that the role of Head of State is collectively exercised by the Cabinet of Ministers, who are each elected by Parliament and whose chair is &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. The Federal Council consists of seven members who are elected by the Federal Assembly (both National Council and Council of States) in joint session, with the chair, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and the vice-president elected annually in rotation by Parliament in order of seniority—meaning that Switzerland actually has no Prime Minister and no member of the Federal Council is superior to another.

By constitutional convention since 1959, the so-called &quot;Magic Formula&quot; () allocates seats in the Federal Council to the four major parties represented in Parliament. Due to that, these major parties form a &quot;de facto&quot; perennial &quot;grand coalition&quot; or constant national unity government with a supermajority in both the National Council and the Council of States. This magic formula was adjusted after the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP) became the largest party represented in Parliament in the 2003 elections, transferring one seat in the Federal Council from the CVP to the SVP.

However, the government&#x27;s policies are only supported on a case-by-case basis by the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, so these major parties are in government and opposition at the same time.
===United Kingdom===

The UK has had grand coalitions in central government during periods of wartime. They are referred to as the &quot;National Government&quot;.

====Northern Ireland====

The Northern Ireland Executive, the devolved administration of Northern Ireland, must by law, be a coalition of the largest Nationalist (also predominantly left of centre) and Unionist (also predominantly right of centre) parties. The chief post, of First Minister and deputy First Minister, is a diarchy. Most recently, this coalition has been led by Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party since the 2024 Northern Ireland Executive formation.

All parties, major and minor, are offered posts in the executive, although they may opt to form an opposition.

====Cayman Islands====

The Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory, had a coalition between the largest parties, the centre-left People&#x27;s Progressive Movement and centre-right Cayman Democratic Party, from 2017 through 2021. The coalition government ended after the 2021 Caymanian general election as a result of the collapse of the Democratic Party that year.

<text>A pocket watch is a watch that is made to be carried in a pocket, as opposed to a wristwatch, which is strapped to the wrist.

They were the most common type of watch from their development in the 16th century until wristwatches became popular after World War I during which a transitional design, trench watches, were used by the military. Pocket watches generally have an attached chain to allow them to be secured to a waistcoat, lapel, or belt loop, and to prevent them from being dropped. Watches were also mounted on a short leather strap or fob, when a long chain would have been cumbersome or likely to catch on things. This fob could also provide a protective flap over their face and crystal. Women&#x27;s watches were normally of this form, with a watch fob that was more decorative than protective. Chains were frequently decorated with a silver or enamel pendant, often carrying the arms of some club or society, which by association also became known as a fob. Ostensibly practical gadgets such as a watch winding key, vesta case, seal, and/or a cigar cutter also appeared on watch chains, although usually in an overly decorated style. Also common are fasteners designed to be put through a buttonhole and worn in a jacket or waistcoat, this sort being frequently associated with and named after train conductors.

An early reference to the pocket watch is in a letter in November 1462 from the Italian clockmaker Bartholomew Manfredi to the Marchese di Mantova Federico Gonzaga, where he offers him a &quot;pocket clock&quot; better than that belonging to the Duke of Modena. By the end of the 15th century, spring-driven clocks appeared in Italy, and in Germany. Peter Henlein, a master locksmith of Nuremberg, was regularly manufacturing pocket watches by 1526. Thereafter, pocket watch manufacture spread throughout the rest of Europe as the 16th century progressed. Early watches only had an hour hand, the minute hand appearing in the late 17th century.

==History==


The first timepieces to be worn, made in 16th-century Europe, were transitional in size between clocks and watches. These &#x27;clock-watches&#x27; were fastened to clothing or worn on a chain around the neck. They were heavy drum shaped brass cylinders several inches in diameter, engraved and ornamented. They had only an hour hand. The face was not covered with glass, but usually had a hinged brass cover, often decoratively pierced with grillwork so the time could be read without opening. The movement was made of iron or steel and held together with tapered pins and wedges, until screws began to be used after 1550. Many of the movements included striking or alarm mechanisms. The shape later evolved into a rounded form; these were later called &quot;Nuremberg eggs&quot;. Still later in the century there was a trend for unusually shaped watches, and clock-watches shaped like books, animals, fruit, stars, flowers, insects, crosses, and even skulls (Death&#x27;s head watches) were made.

Styles changed in the 17th century and men began to wear watches in pockets instead of as pendants (the woman&#x27;s watch remained a pendant into the 20th century). This is said to have occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocket watch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word &quot;fuppe&quot;, a small pocket. The watch was wound and also set by opening the back and fitting a key to a square arbor, and turning it.

Until the second half of the 18th century, watches were luxury items; as an indication of how highly they were valued, English newspapers of the 18th century often include advertisements offering rewards of between one and five guineas merely for information that might lead to the recovery of stolen watches. By the end of the 18th century, however, watches (while still largely hand-made) were becoming more common; special cheap watches were made for sale to sailors, with crude but colorful paintings of maritime scenes on the dials.

Up to the 1720s, almost all watch movements were based on the verge escapement, which had been developed for large public clocks in the 14th century. This type of escapement involved a high degree of friction and did not include any kind of jewelling to protect the contacting surfaces from wear. As a result, a verge watch could rarely achieve any high standard of accuracy. (Surviving examples mostly run very fast, often gaining an hour a day or more.) The first widely used improvement was the cylinder escapement, developed by the Abbé de Hautefeuille early in the 18th century and applied by the English maker George Graham. Then, towards the end of the 18th century, the lever escapement (invented by Thomas Mudge in 1755) was put into limited production by a handful of makers including Josiah Emery (a Swiss based in London) and Abraham-Louis Breguet. With this, a domestic watch could keep time to within a minute a day. Lever watches became common after about 1820, and this type is still used in most mechanical watches.

In 1857 the American Watch Company in Waltham, Massachusetts, introduced the Waltham Model 57, the first to use interchangeable parts. This cut the cost of manufacture and repair. Most Model 57 pocket watches were in a coin silver (&quot;one nine fine&quot;), a 90% pure silver alloy commonly used in dollar coinage, slightly less pure than the British (92.5%) sterling silver, both of which avoided the higher purity of other types of silver to make circulating coins and other utilitarian silver objects last longer with heavy use.

Watch manufacture was becoming streamlined; the Japy family of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, led the way in this, and soon afterwards the newborn American watch industry developed much new machinery, so that by 1865 the American Watch Company (afterwards known as Waltham) could turn out more than 50,000 reliable watches each year. This development drove the Swiss out of their dominating position at the cheaper end of the market, compelling them to raise the quality of their products and establish themselves as the leaders in precision and accuracy instead.

==Use in railroading in the United States==
The rise of railroading during the last half of the 19th century led to the widespread use of pocket watches.

A famous train wreck on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in Kipton, Ohio, on April 19, 1891, occurred because one of the engineers&#x27; watches had stopped for four minutes. The railroad officials commissioned Webb C. Ball as their Chief Time Inspector, in order to establish precision standards and a reliable timepiece inspection system for railroad chronometers. This led to the adoption in 1893 of stringent standards for pocket watches used in railroading. These railroad-grade pocket watches, as they became colloquially known, had to meet the General Railroad Timepiece Standards adopted in 1893 by almost all railroads. These standards read, in part:

==Types of pocket watches==
There are two main styles of pocket watch, the hunter-case pocket watch and the open-face pocket watch.

===Open-face watches===

An open-faced, or Lépine, watch, is one in which the case lacks a metal cover to protect the crystal. It is typical for an open-faced watch to have the pendant located at 12:00 and the sub-second dial located at 6:00. Occasionally, a watch movement intended for a hunting case (with the winding stem at 3:00 and sub second dial at 6:00) will have an open-faced case. Such watch is known as a &quot;sidewinder.&quot; Alternatively, such a watch movement may be fitted with a so-called conversion dial, which relocates the winding stem to 12:00 and the sub-second dial to 3:00. After 1908, watches approved for railroad service were required to be cased in open-faced cases with the winding stem at 12:00.

===Hunter-case watches===
A hunter-case pocket watch is a case with a spring-hinged circular metal lid or cover, that closes over the watch-dial and crystal, protecting them from dust, scratches and other damage or debris. The name originated from England where &quot;fox hunting men found it convenient to be able to open their watch and read the time with one hand, while holding the reins of their &#x27;hunter&#x27; (horse) in the other hand&quot;.
It is also known as a &quot;savonnette&quot;, after the French word for soap (savon) due to its resemblance to a round soap bar.

The majority of antique and vintage hunter-case watches have the lid-hinges at the 9 o&#x27;clock position and the stem, crown and bow of the watch at the 3 o&#x27;clock position. Modern hunter-case pocket watches usually have the hinges for the lid at the 6 o&#x27;clock position and the stem, crown and bow at the 12 o&#x27;clock position, as with open-face watches. In both styles of watch-cases, the sub-seconds dial was always at the 6 o&#x27;clock position. A hunter-case pocket watch with a spring-ring chain is pictured at the top of this page.

An intermediate type, known as the demi-hunter (or half-hunter), is a case style in which the outer lid has a glass panel or hole in the centre giving a view of the hands. The hours are marked, often in blue enamel, on the outer lid itself; thus with this type of case one can tell the time without opening the lid.

==Types of watch movements==
===Key-wind, key-set movements===
The first pocket watches, since their creation in the 16th century, up until the third quarter of the 19th century, had key-wind and key-set movements. A watch key was necessary to wind the watch and to set the time. This was usually done by opening the caseback and putting the key over the winding-arbor (which was set over the watch&#x27;s winding-wheel, to wind the mainspring) or by putting the key onto the setting-arbor, which was connected with the minute-wheel and turned the hands. Some watches of this period had the setting-arbor at the front of the watch, so that removing the crystal and bezel was necessary to set the time. Watch keys are the origin of the class key, common paraphernalia for American high-school and university graduation.

Many keywind watch movements make use of a fusee, to improve isochronism. The fusee is a specially cut conical pulley attached by a fine chain to the mainspring barrel. When the spring is fully wound (and its torque the highest), the full length of the chain is wrapped around the fusee and the force of the mainspring is exerted on the smallest diameter portion of the fusee cone. As the spring unwinds and its torque decreases, the chain winds back onto the mainspring barrel and pulls on an increasingly larger diameter portion of the fusee. This provides a more uniform amount of torque on the watch train, and thus results in more consistent balance amplitude and better isochronism. A fusee is a practical necessity in watches using a verge escapement, and can also provide considerable benefit with a lever escapement and other high precision types of escapements (Hamiltons WWII era Model 21 chronometer used a fusee in combination with a detent escapement).

Keywind watches are also commonly seen with conventional going barrels and other types of mainspring barrels, particularly in American watchmaking.

===Stem-wind, stem-set movements===
Invented by Adrien Philippe in 1842 and commercialized by Patek Philippe &amp; Co. in the 1850s, the stem-wind, stem-set movement did away with the watch key which was a necessity for the operation of any pocket watch up to that point. The first stem-wind and stem-set pocket watches were sold during the Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and the first owners of these new kinds of watches were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Stem-wind, stem-set movements are the most common type of watch-movement found in both vintage and modern pocket watches.

The mainstream transition to the use of stem-wind, stem-set watches occurred at around the same time as the end of the manufacture and use of the fusee watch. Fusee chain-driven timing was replaced with a mainspring of better quality spring steel (commonly known as the &quot;going barrel&quot;) allowing for a more even release of power to the escape mechanism. The balance wheel and balance spring provide a separate function: to regulate the timing (or escape) of the movement.

===Stem-wind, lever-set movements===
Mandatory for all railroad watches after roughly 1908, this kind of pocket watch was set by opening the crystal and bezel and pulling out the setting-lever (most hunter-cases have levers accessible without removing the crystal or bezel), which was generally found at either the 10 or 2 o&#x27;clock positions on open-faced watches, and at 5:00 on hunting cased watches. Once the lever was pulled out, the crown could be turned to set the time. The lever was then pushed back in and the crystal and bezel were closed over the dial again. This method of time setting on pocket watches was preferred by American and Canadian railroads, as lever setting watches make accidental time changes impossible. After 1908, lever setting was generally required for new watches entering service on American railroads.

===Stem-wind, pin-set movements===
Much like the lever-set movements, these pocket watches had a small pin or knob next to the watch-stem that had to be depressed before turning the crown to set the time and releasing the pin when the correct time had been set. This style of watch is occasionally referred to as &quot;nail set&quot;, as the set button must be pressed using a fingernail.

==Adjusted movements==
Pocket watch movements are occasionally engraved with the word &quot;Adjusted&quot;, or &quot;Adjusted to &quot;n&quot; positions&quot;. This means that the watch has been tuned to keep time under various positions and conditions. There are eight possible adjustments:

* Dial up
* Dial down
* Pendant up
* Pendant down
* Pendant left
* Pendant right
* Temperature (from )
* Isochronism (the ability of the watch to keep time, regardless of the mainspring&#x27;s level of tension)

Positional adjustments are attained by careful poising (ensuring even weight distribution) of the balance-hairspring system as well as careful control of the shape and polish on the balance pivots. All of this achieves an equalization of the effect of gravity on the watch in various positions. Positional adjustments are achieved through careful adjustment of each of these factors, provided by repeated trials on a timing machine. Thus, adjusting a watch to position requires many hours of labor, increasing the cost of the watch. Medium grade watches were commonly adjusted to 3 positions (dial up, dial down, pendant up) while high grade watches were commonly adjusted to 5 positions (dial up, dial down, stem up, stem left, stem right) or even all 6 positions. Railroad watches were required, after 1908, to be adjusted to 5 positions. 3 positions were the general requirement before that time.

Early watches used a solid steel balance. As temperature increased, the solid balance expanded in size, changing the moment of inertia and changing the timing of the watch. In addition, the hairspring would lengthen, decreasing its spring constant. This problem was initially solved through the use of the compensation balance. The compensation balance consisted of a ring of steel sandwiched to a ring of brass. These rings were then split in two places. The balance would, at least theoretically, actually decrease in size with heating to compensate for the lengthening of the hairspring. Through careful adjustment of the placement of the balance screws (brass or gold screws placed in the rim of the balance), a watch could be adjusted to keep time the same at both hot () and cold () temperatures. Unfortunately, a watch so adjusted would run slow at temperatures between these two. The problem was completely solved through the use of special alloys for the balance and hairspring which were essentially immune to thermal expansion. Such an alloy is used in Hamilton&#x27;s 992E and 992B.

Isochronism was occasionally improved through the use of a stopworks, a system designed to only allow the mainspring to operate within its center (most consistent) range. The most common method of achieving isochronism is through the use of the Breguet overcoil, which places part of the outermost turn of the hairspring in a different plane from the rest of the spring. This allows the hairspring to &quot;breathe&quot; more evenly and symmetrically. Two types of overcoils are found - the gradual overcoil and the Z-Bend. The gradual overcoil is obtained by imposing two gradual twists to the hairspring, forming the rise to the second plane over half the circumference; and the Z-bend does this by imposing two kinks of complementary 45 degree angles, accomplishing a rise to the second plane in about three spring section heights. The second method is done for esthetic reasons and is much more difficult to perform. Due to the difficulty with forming an overcoil, modern watches often use a slightly less effective &quot;dogleg&quot;, which uses a series of sharp bends (in plane) to place part of the outermost coil out of the way of the rest of the spring.

==Decline in popularity==

Pocket watches are uncommon in the present day, having first been superseded by wristwatches and later by smartphones. Until early in the 20th century, though, the pocket watch remained predominant for men, with the wristwatch considered feminine and unmanly. In men&#x27;s fashions, pocket watches began to be superseded by wristwatches around the time of World War I, when officers in the field began to appreciate that a watch worn on the wrist was more easily accessed than one kept in a pocket. A watch of transitional design, combining features of pocket watches and modern wristwatches, was called a &quot;trench watch&quot; or &quot;wristlet&quot;. The more accurate pocket watches continued to be widely used in railroading even as their popularity declined elsewhere. Quartz pocket watches are available in the present day, retaining the form and function of the original pocket watches while using a quartz crystal as opposed to the traditional fully-mechanical movement.

For a few years in the late 1970s and early 1980s three-piece suits for men returned to fashion, and this led to small resurgence in pocket watches, as some men actually used the vest pocket for its original purpose. Since then, some watch companies continue to make pocket watches. As vests have long since fallen out of fashion (in the US) as part of formal business wear, the only available location for carrying a watch is in a trouser pocket. The more recent advent of mobile phones and other gadgets that are worn on the waist has diminished the appeal of carrying an additional item in the same location, especially as such pocketable gadgets usually have timekeeping functionality themselves.

In some countries, namely the US, a gift of a gold-cased pocket watch is traditionally awarded to an employee upon their retirement.

The pocket watch has regained popularity with the steampunk subcultural movement embracing the arts and fashions of the Victorian era, during which pocket watches were nearly ubiquitous.

In animated films and video games, especially within the fantasy genre, devices resembling pocket watches commonly represent objects with the ability to alter time, such as by time travel.

<doc id="767900" wikidata="Q177046" url="?curid=767900" title="Gabriel de Lorges, Count of Montgomery">
<text>Gabriel de Lorges, Count of Montgomery, Lord of Lorges and Ducey (5 May 153026 June 1574), was a French nobleman of Scottish extraction and captain of the Scots Guard of King Henry II of France. He is remembered for mortally injuring Henry II in a jousting accident and subsequently converting to Protestantism, the faith that the Scots Guard sought to suppress. He became a leader of the Huguenots. In French-language contexts, his name is spelled Montgommery.

==Career==
On 30 June 1559, during a jousting match to celebrate the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis between Henry II and his longtime Habsburg enemies, and two major marriages, namely that of Marguerite, the king&#x27;s sister, with the Duke of Savoy Emmanuel-Philibert, and that of Elisabeth, the king&#x27;s eldest daughter, with Philip II, king of Spain, a splinter of wood from Montgomery&#x27;s shattered lance pierced Henry&#x27;s eye and entered his brain, fatally injuring him. From his deathbed Henry absolved Montgomery of any blame, before dying on 10 July 1559. However, finding himself disgraced, Montgomery retreated to his estates in Normandy. There he studied theology and converted to Protestantism, making him an enemy of the state.

During the First War (1562–63) he fought for the Huguenots, capturing Bourges and leading several campaigns in his native Normandy. He led the defense of Rouen, and escaped the city just as it fell to the enemy.

He remained in France after the Peace of Amboise brought an end to the fighting. He took up arms again in 1567 when the wars of religion were renewed, and served under Condé in the major campaigns of 1567, 1568, and 1569.

Shortly after Condé&#x27;s death at Jarnac in March 1569, Montgomery was tasked with restoring Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, the Huguenot queen of Navarre, to her territories in Béarn, which had been conquered by Catholic forces. He led a rapid campaign, which resulted in the destruction of a Catholic army at Orthez in August 1569. 

Montgomery then, in early January, linked up with the survivors of the disastrous battle of Moncontour. The combined army, led by Coligny and the young princes of Condé and Navarre, fought the Catholics to a standstill at Arnay-le-Duc and imposed a favorable peace on the Crown.

He was one of the few leaders to survive the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre after a wounded Huguenot swam across the Seine to warn him that rioting had begun. A price was put on his head, but he managed to escape to England. The queen mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, asked Queen Elizabeth I for his extradition, but Elizabeth refused.
Montgomery returned to France with a fleet in an attempt to relieve the Siege of La Rochelle in 1573. The following year he attempted an insurrection in Normandy, but was captured, taken to Paris, and sentenced to death. On 26 June 1574, as he was about to be beheaded, Montgomery was informed that a royal edict had proclaimed that his property would be confiscated and his children deprived of their titles.

A freely adapted version of Montgomery&#x27;s life is told in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Two Dianas&quot; (1846–47), and he appears as a central character in Johann August Apel&#x27;s story &quot;Klara Mongomery&quot; in the &quot;Gespensterbuch&quot; (1811).

==Marriage and issue==
He married (1550) Isabeau de La Touche (died 1593), by whom he had four sons and four daughters:

===Sons===
* Jacques I de Montgomery (1551–1560)
* Gédéon de Montgomery (died 1596)
* Gilles de Montgomery (1558–1596)
* Gabriel II de Montgomery (1565–1635), who built the Château de Ducey, and was father to six children:
** Louise de Montgomery
** Gabriel III de Montgomery (1595–1635)
** Suzanne de Montgomery
** Louis I de Montgomery (1601–1682)
** Jean de Montgomery (1605–1694)
** Jacques III de Montgomery (1609–1682)

===Daughters===
* Suzanne de Montgomery
* Elisabeth de Montgomery
* Claude de Montgomery
* Roberte de Montgomery, wife of Gawen Champernowne (died 1591) of Dartington in Devon, by whom she had issue. In 1582 she divorced him for adultery and in 1595 married Thomas Horner of Cloford.

<doc id="767912" wikidata="Q1676563" url="?curid=767912" title="Human polyomavirus 2">
<text>Human polyomavirus 2, commonly referred to as the JC virus or John Cunningham virus, is a type of human polyomavirus (formerly known as papovavirus). It was identified by electron microscopy in 1965 by ZuRhein and Chou, and by Silverman and Rubinstein. It was later isolated in culture and named using the initials of a patient by the name of John Cunningham from whom it was isolated and had developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The virus causes leukoencephalopathy and other diseases only in cases of immunodeficiency, as in AIDS or during treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. in organ transplant patients).

==Infection and pathogenesis==
The initial site of infection may be the tonsils, or possibly the gastrointestinal tract. The virus then remains latent in the gastrointestinal tract and can also infect the tubular epithelial cells in the kidneys, where it continues to reproduce, shedding virus particles in the urine. In addition, recent studies suggest that this virus may latently infect the human semen as well as the chorionic villi tissues. Serum antibodies against &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; have also been found in spontaneous abortion-affected women as well as in women who underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy.

&quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; can cross the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system, where it infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, possibly through the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor. &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; DNA can be detected in both non-PML affected and PML-affected (see below) brain tissue.

&quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; found in the central nervous system of PML patients almost invariably have differences in promoter sequence to &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; found in healthy individuals. It is thought that these differences in promoter sequence contribute to the fitness of the virus in the CNS and thus to the development of PML. Certain transcription factors present in the early promoter sequences of &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; can induce tropism and viral proliferation that leads to PML. The Spi-B factor was shown to be crucial in initiating viral replication in certain strains of transgenic mice. The protein encoded by these early sequences, T-antigen, also plays a key role in viral proliferation, directing the initiation of DNA replication for the virus as well as performing a transcriptional switch to allow for the formation of the various capsid and regulatory proteins needed for viral fitness. Further research is needed to determine the exact etiological role of T-antigen, but there seems to be a connection to the early initiation of the active virus from its archetypal dormant state.

Immunodeficiency or immunosuppression allows &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; to reactivate. In the brain, it causes the often fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, by destroying oligodendrocytes. Whether this represents the reactivation of &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; within the CNS or seeding of newly reactivated &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; via blood or lymphatics is unknown. Several studies since 2000 have suggested that the virus is also linked to colorectal cancer, as &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; has been found in malignant colon tumors, but these findings are still controversial.

==Other strains and novel pathological syndromes==
Although &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; infection is classically associated with white matter demyelination and PML pathogenesis, recent literature has identified viral variants as etiological agents of other novel syndromes. For example, &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; has been found to infect the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, while sparing Purkinje cells, ultimately causing severe cerebellar atrophy. This syndrome, called JCV granule cell layer neuronopathy (JCV GCN), is characterized by a productive and lytic infection by a JC variant with a mutation in the VP1 coding region.

&quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; also appears to mediate encephalopathy, due to infection of cortical pyramidal neurons (CPN) and astrocytes. Analysis of the JCV CPN variant revealed differences from JCV GCN: no mutations were found in the VP1 coding region; however, a 143–base-pair deletion was identified in the agnogene, coding for a 10–amino-acid truncated peptide, which is believed to mediate CPN tropism. Additionally, analysis of the subcellular localization of JC CPN virions in nuclei, cytoplasm, and axons suggests that the virus may travel through axons to increase infectivity.

&quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; may also be a causative agent of aseptic meningitis (JCVM), as &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; was the only pathogen identified in the CSF of certain patients with meningitis. Analysis of the JCVM variant revealed archetype-like regulatory regions with no mutations in coding sequences. The precise molecular mechanisms mediating &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; meningeal tropism remain to be found.

==Epidemiology==

The virus is very common in the general population, infecting 70% to 90% of humans; most people acquire &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; in childhood or adolescence. It is found in high concentrations in urban sewage worldwide, leading some researchers to suspect contaminated water as a typical route of infection.

Minor genetic variations are found consistently in different geographic areas; thus, genetic analysis of &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; samples has been useful in tracing the history of human migration. 14 subtypes or genotypes are recognised each associated with a specific geographical region. Three are found in Europe (a, b and c). A minor African type—Af1—occurs in Central and West Africa. The major African type—Af2—is found throughout Africa and also in West and South Asia. Several Asian types are recognised B1-a, B1-b, B1-d, B2, CY, MY and SC.

An alternative numbering scheme numbers the genotypes 1–8 with additional lettering. Types 1 and 4 are found in Europe and in indigenous populations in northern Japan, North-East Siberia and northern Canada. These two types are closely related. Types 3 and 6 are found in sub-Saharan Africa: type 3 was isolated in Ethiopia, Tanzania and South Africa. Type 6 is found in Ghana. Both types are also found in the Biaka Pygmies and Bantus from Central Africa. Type 2 has several variants: subtype 2A is found mainly in the Japanese population and Native Americans (excluding Inuit); 2B is found in Eurasians; 2D is found in Indians and 2E is found in Australians and western Pacific populations. Subtype 7A is found in southern China and South-East Asia. Subtype 7B is found in northern China, Mongolia and Japan Subtype 7C is found in northern and southern China. Subtype 8 is found in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. The geographic distribution of JC polyomavirus types may help to trace humans from different continents by JC genotyping.

==Drugs associated with reactivation==
Since immunodeficiency causes this virus to progress to PML, immunosuppressants are contraindicated in those who are infected.

The boxed warning for the drug rituximab (Rituxan) includes a statement that &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and death has been reported in patients treated with the drug.

The boxed warning for the drug natalizumab (Tysabri) includes a statement that &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot; resulted in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy developing in three patients who received natalizumab in clinical trials. This is now one of the most common causes of PML.

The boxed warning had been included for the drugs Tecfidera and Gilenya, both of which have had incidences of PML resulting in death.

The boxed warning was added on February 19, 2009, for the drug efalizumab (Raptiva) includes a statement that &quot;Human polyomavirus 2&quot;, resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, developed in three patients who received efalizumab in clinical trials. The drug was pulled off the U.S. market because of the association with PML on April 10, 2009.

A boxed warning for brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) was issued by the FDA on January 13, 2011 after two cases of PML were reported, bringing the total number of associated cases to three.

==Human Migration Patterns==
It has been observed that several region-specific subtypes of this virus occur in different populations. Based on this observation, the subtypes of this virus have now been used to study human migration patterns. Currently more than 30 genotypes of this virus are known.

<text>Lawrence Hugh Aller (September 24, 1913 – March 16, 2003) was an American astronomer. He was born in Tacoma, Washington. He never finished high school and worked for a time as a gold miner. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936 and went to graduate school at Harvard in 1937. There he obtained his master&#x27;s degree in 1938 and his PhD in 1943. From 1943 to 1945 he worked on the Manhattan Project at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. He was an assistant professor at Indiana University from 1945 to 1948 and then an associate professor and professor at the University of Michigan until 1962. He moved to UCLA in 1962 and helped build its astronomy department. He was chair of the department from 1963 to 1968.

His work concentrated on the chemical composition of stars and nebulae. He was one of the first astronomers to argue that some differences in stellar and nebular spectra were caused by differences in their chemical composition. Aller wrote a number of books, including &quot;Atoms, Stars, and Nebulae&quot;, the third edition of which was published in 1991 (). He published 346 research papers between 1935 and 2004.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961 and to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1962. He won the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship in 1992.

His doctoral students include James B. Kaler and William Liller.

As of 2011, one of his three sons, Hugh Aller, was a professor and his daughter-in law, Margot Aller, a research scientist in the University of Michigan astronomy department. His granddaughter, Monique Aller, was previously a graduate student also in the University of Michigan astronomy department and teaches in the Physics and Astronomy Department at Georgia Southern University.

<doc id="767930" wikidata="Q7712756" url="?curid=767930" title="Affair at Little Egg Harbor">
<text>The Affair at Little Egg Harbor took place on October 15, 1778, in South Jersey during the American Revolutionary War. American Loyalists killed 45 Patriot men, bayonetting them as they slept. The massacre took place about one week after the Battle of Chestnut Neck, a British raid aimed at suppressing privateers who used the area as a base to harass and seize British ships and their cargoes.

==Background==

British Army officer Captain Patrick Ferguson led a raid on Chestnut Neck, on the Mullica River, to retrieve supplies taken by privateers and try to stop their use of the town as a base for the distribution of their prizes and shipment of captured goods to General Washington at Valley Forge.

Kazimierz Pułaski and his newly raised forces were ordered to oppose his actions. Pulaski&#x27;s Legion, along with three companies of light infantry, three troops of light horse, and one artillery detachment, arrived the day after Ferguson departed Chestnut Neck. But their arrival did stop Ferguson from raiding the iron works at Batsto. The plan was to attack Batsto, but the river proved too shallow and time ran out, Batsto remained untouched.
 and stemmed their attacks on privateers at The Forks of the Mullica River. For a week the two forces were at a standoff.

==Attack==

Pulaski&#x27;s troops reached the Little Egg Harbor district (near present-day Tuckerton), and immediately set up camp on a farm.

Lt. Gustav Juliet, a deserter, found Ferguson and told him of Pulaski&#x27;s encampment; he mentioned that morale was fairly low, and security almost nonexistent. Ferguson promptly loaded 250 of his best men onto boats and rowed them, in the dark, some to what is now Osborne Island. He marched them to the site of the infantry outpost, which comprised fifty men a short distance from the main encampment. At first light, Ferguson ordered the attack; he took only five prisoners and his men, all American Loyalists, killed nearly 50 men.

Pulaski eventually led up his mounted troops, causing Ferguson to retreat to his boats, and leaving a few men who had fallen into the Patriot colonists&#x27; hands.

==Legacy==
*The farm land which was the site of the massacre has been developed as the Country Club Estates; a small parcel of the colonial farm was preserved on a plot of land between Hollybrook Drive and Cedarbrook Lane.
*The Pulaski Monument is located on Pulaski Blvd in the Mystic Island section of Little Egg Harbor.

<doc id="767931" wikidata="Q2932446" url="?curid=767931" title="Cabot, Vermont">
<text>Cabot is a six-mile-square New England town located in the northeast corner of Washington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,443 at the 2020 census. It contains the unincorporated villages of Cabot Village, Cabot Plain, South Cabot (Hookerville), East Cabot, Lower Cabot, and West Hill. There was also a community known as Petersville until property owners there sold a total of 100 acres to Molly’s Falls Electric Light and Power Company, and in 1925 a large dam was constructed on Molly’s Brook (named after Molly, the wife of Indian Joe), that completely flooded the area that had been farms and homes to create what is now known as Molly’s Falls Reservoir, or sometimes “Marshfield Dam,” which is located close to the Cabot/Marshfield town line.

The most notable of Cabot’s several ponds are:  Coit’s Pond, the origin of the Winooski River; Molly’s Pond that sits on the Continental Divide and has outlets flowing east towards the Connecticut River and west into the Winooski River and Lake Champlain; West Hill Pond, originally called the “great field” by early settlers as it was the only cleared area for miles in the wilderness before a dam on the brook created a shallow pond; and the three-mile-long, 396 acre Joe’s Pond (named for Indian Joe) situated in Cabot, Walden and Danville. Molly’s Pond State Park has over 1,000 acres and includes the 411-acre reservoir created by a dam built in 1926-27 that flooded the small farming community of Petersville. This reservoir, which is entirely within the town of Cabot, provides power to operate Marshfield No. 6 hydroelectric plant located just over the town line between Cabot and Marshfield on Rte. 215S.

Cabot is the location of the Cabot Creamery, founded in 1893 primarily as a butter factory to add value to milk production. Today the creamery is a producer and national distributor of dairy products, especially known for their cheddar cheese. Cabot Creamery is by far Cabot’s largest employer with a manufacturing and packaging plant at the original site and extensions of the business in nearby locations as well as New York state and Massachusetts. Organized as a cooperative in 1919 by 94 members with a total of 863 cows, the creamery has struggled and re-invented itself several times as economic and population changes have occurred. There were 77 farms sending milk to the Cabot Creamery Cooperative in 1952, eight of which were within the village limits. Today there are no farms within the village limits and only six dairy farms within the entire town. The creamery draws from other towns for the massive amount of product needed to sustain the ever-growing demand for Cabot cheese. 

Former Cabot dairy farms are now large fruit orchards, maple operations, vegetable farms, or are growing herbs or producing hay, raising beef, sheep, turkeys, or goats. Crafters, wood carvers, arborists, gardeners/landscapers, musicians, authors and other professionals or retirees make their home in the historic scenic landscape of rural Cabot.

The village of Cabot nestles on the banks of the Winooski River. It is now the only community within the township with active commerce. The post office, church with a day-care center, library, and town offices are situated there, along with a volunteer fire department and ambulance service. Main Street businesses include a grocery store and deli; computer sales, service, and drone business; an automotive garage; a bar serving craft beer and cider located in a hardware store; and a restaurant and pub. There is also an 8-unit senior housing complex, Cabot Commons, opened in 2005, within easy access of downtown businesses and the town offices and library located in the Willey Memorial Building. The former Masonic Lodge Hall is now home to “Neighbors in Action,” an active community service organization.

Cabot is fortunate to have an art barn gallery that is open for exhibits in the summer, and the Cabot Historical Society, also open from about May to October. The historical society houses an impressive collection of artifacts, along with a library of genealogy and reference materials. The two-story former school and community hall that was built in 1849 has been uniquely preserved to display the town’s historical artifacts. The society also owns and maintains a restored one-room schoolhouse located on West Hill.

Throughout the year, the village common hosts a variety of concerts, field days, farmers’ markets, and craft events. There is a community skating rink on the common in the winter, and hiking and snowmobile trails run through the town. There is also a well-maintained town forest. 

Cabot holds annual town meetings and its business is managed by a five-member selectboard that meets regularly, at least twice each month.

==History==
The town of Cabot was granted in 1780, and settlement began on the Plain, also known as Fortification Hill or Johnson’s Plain when the military were encamped there. The first settler, Benjamin Webster, arrived in 1783, followed by Lieut. Jonathan Heath, Nathaniel Webster, and Lieut. Thomas Lyford, with their families. The town was named by settler Lyman Hitchcock after his wife, Sophia Cabot (no relation to Venetian explorers John and Sebastian Cabot). Lyman Hitchcock became in 1788 the first town clerk of Cabot. 

When the Bayley-Hazen Military Road opened in 1775-1776 from Newbury northwest to what is now known as Cabot Plain, the original intent was to build a road through the unexplored wilderness from the northernmost town of Newbury to St. Johns, Quebec, Canada, to facilitate getting supplies to the army that hoped to defeat the British and capture Canada. The road was never completed, but it served to open the northern territory for settlement. 

Cabot Plain remained the business center of town until around 1796, when town officials decided to move business to the geographic center of the town, about a mile downhill south of the Plain. A meeting house was constructed, also a pound to contain wandering farm animals, and a whipping post that was used only once to punish an errant citizen. By 1799, all town business was conducted at the Center of Town and gradually traffic over the Plain diminished. 

As the town grew, mills, businesses, and farms clustered near the Winooski River and extended south to form a community known as Lower Cabot. By about 1826 the business affairs of the town had moved from the geographic center of the town to the new settlement in the valley by the Winooski River, where it remains today. 

The Town of Cabot was incorporated on November 19, 1866. Communities within the township clustered along brooks or near ponds, utilizing the abundant waterpower for sawmills, grist mills, and in Lower Cabot, a woolen mill.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 1,433 people, 570 households, and 404 families residing in the town. The population density was 37.2 people per square mile (14.4/km2). There were 771 housing units at an average density of 20.0 per square mile (7.7/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.2% White, 0.6% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.6% of the population.

There were 570 households, out of which 32.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.2% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.1% were non-families. 23.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.51 and the average family size was 2.94.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 24.7% under the age of 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 22.3% from 25 to 44, 32.6% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.4 males.

As of the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the town was $43,092, and the median income for a family was $49,205. Males had a median income of $31,544 versus $25,000 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,585. About 4.4% of families and 7.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.2% of those under age 18 and 5.7% of those age 65 or over.

== Schools ==
Each community had its own school, the first being on the Plain, then known as “Shepherd’s Hill” at the junction of what is now the Bayley Hazen Road and Cabot Plains Road. It was a log cabin with no windows and only a fireplace for heat. Pegs driven into the logs supported boards that served as desks for the students sitting on benches. The first schoolteacher there was John Gunn in the summer of 1792. A few years later a new school was under construction opposite where the cemetery is today, but before it was finished it was moved from that “bleak place” to the corner near where the log school had been.

Early schools were scattered throughout the town strategically so that no student had to walk more than two miles to attend. The early buildings had few windows, no electricity or plumbing, and usually a large iron stove set in the middle of the room for heat. Each school had at least one outhouse or “privy,” and students used a communal bucket of water with a dipper for drinking. Teachers in the earliest schools were sometimes itinerant men who contracted to teach for a few weeks, depending on what the town could afford; or sometimes a young girl in town who had at least some education that was considered adequate for her to teach. Male teachers were always paid more than female teachers, regardless of their qualifications. 

The Cabot Plains School at the junction of Cabot Plains Road and Bolton Road was built in 1923 and was the town’s first “Standard School.” It replaced a basic one-room building which was later sold and used as a garage. The new building had central heating, water, electricity, and toilets. Cabot’s second “Standard School” was built in 1930 in South Cabot. None of the schools had more than one teacher, and sometimes upwards of thirty students in all eight grades. Both the Cabot Plains school and the South Cabot school are now private residences. There are several other original school buildings in existence in town, all privately owned except the West Hill school that is owned by the Cabot Historical Society and open on special occasions for tours.

Cabot’s one-room schools closed gradually as the population in communities changed. There was a general decline in farms after the Civil War as young men left Vermont seeking a better climate and free land for farming or other enterprises. As the town’s population dwindled, maintaining one-room schools for only a few students became an expensive burden, and with better roads and automobiles, the smaller schools were gradually closed.  The schools in Lower Cabot, Cabot Plain and East Cabot closed in 1948, and the South Cabot school closed in 1954. Children were then transported by bus to the Cabot Village School, built in 1938, that served grades one through twelve and is still in use, now serving pre-K-12 students. Several of Cabot’s one-room schools are still standing and are privately owned seasonal or year-around residences.

Today Cabot maintains one of the few pre-K-12 schools left in Vermont. The school campus includes a gymnasium, performing arts center, several individual buildings for elementary students, and there are two recreation fields that are each within walking distance from the campus. 

== Cemeteries   ==
There are seven cemeteries in Cabot. Each small community had their own burial ground. The first formal cemetery was established in 1799 at the center of town on land purchased from William Osgood, a long-time town clerk for Cabot. Osgood was the first to be buried there in 1801; the last burial in that cemetery was in 1846. It is well maintained and at least eight Revolutionary War veterans are among a total of 89 people known to be buried there.

Durant Cemetery (1812-present) is in Lower Cabot; Kimball (1814) was a very small grave site on West Hill that was replaced by the existing West Hill (1817- present) cemetery; Cabot Village, also known as Elm Street Cemetery (1820-present), Cabot Plains (1825-present); South Cabot (1834 to present); and East Cabot (1847 to present). A feature at Durant is the Sunken Garden, near the Winooski River. Cabot Plains Cemetery has views of Camel&#x27;s Hump, the Worcester Range and Mt. Mansfield in the west, Jay Peak and Canadian peaks in the north, and the White Mountains looking east. West Hill cemetery is in the middle of a working farm; the Center Cemetery is quite remote among tall pine trees with only a path through farm fields to reach it.

== Historic sites ==
The historic Bayley-Hazen Road crosses Cabot Plain from the Danville-Cabot town line near Route 2 and West Shore Road and continues in a generally northwesterly direction to cross Route 215 into Walden and ends at Hazen’s Notch in Lowell, Vermont. The road was intended to provide a shorter supply route to America&#x27;s Continental Army in St. Johns, Quebec, Canada during the American Revolution of 1776. Colonel Jacob Bayley initiated the idea of the road in the spring of 1776, and Thomas Johnson and a small party of men blazed the trail and measured the distance. Johnson estimated the new road would be some 73 miles shorter than the route to Crown Point which was currently being used. Bayley presented the plan to George Washington, Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. Washington agreed to Bayley&#x27;s proposal; however, the Continental Congress was slow to make a decision, Approval for the work was finally granted, and in the early summer of 1776, James Whitelaw began surveying the route and Bayley and his crew of 110 men began work, following closely behind the surveying crew. Shortly after work began on the road Bayley was informed that the Continental Army had been defeated and the road was no longer a military priority. Bayley and his men abandoned the project on Cabot Plain and returned to Newbury.

There were plans in the summer of 1778 for another invasion of Canada, and General Moses Hazen was sent to complete the road Colonel Bayley had begun. Soon after work resumed, it became evident that the British would use the proposed road as a guide to reach deep into Vermont. There were a few skirmishes when small scouting parties ventured south along the trail, and by the end of the summer of 1779, work ceased entirely and the road was never finished beyond Hazen’s Notch in Lowell.

There are markers on Cabot Plain showing the location of the military road and Hazen&#x27;s encampment site.

== Military notes ==
Three hundred men from Cabot were eligible to serve during the Civil War. Of these, one hundred forty-five (48%) volunteered. Most served in units mustering in St. Johnsbury: the 16th, 3rd and 4th Vermont Regiments. Forty-five were killed, for a fatality rate of 31%. Furthermore, it is likely that most of the rest suffered non-fatal casualties. Seventeen of these dead are honored by name on a war monument which stands in town; the others were not known to those who erected the monument.

At least 47 men enlisted in the military to serve during WWI. There is no accurate count of how many men died in that war. Approximately 149 enlisted to serve in WWII, and four were killed while serving.

A memorial honoring men and women from Cabot, who served in recent wars, was erected in front of Willey Memorial Hall and dedicated in 1992.

==Climate and weather==

Cabot has a typical northern Vermont climate with a generally short growing season. Winters can be harsh with high snow amounts and long periods of below-zero temperatures. Summers are normally moderate with fluctuating temperatures and conditions. Due to the hilly landscape of the town, it is prone to flood damage, particularly in Cabot Village, and the hill sections to damaging winds.

<text>F.P.J. Peutz (7 April 1896 – 24 October 1974) was a Dutch architect.

==Biography==
Peutz was born in a Catholic family in Uithuizen in Groningen, a mostly Protestant province in the north of the Netherlands. In 1910 he was sent to the Rolduc boarding school in Kerkrade in the Catholic province of Limburg for his higher education. In 1914 he graduated at the HBS, an old type of Dutch high school. After that he studied civil engineering in Delft. In 1916 he changed to architecture. In 1920, while still not graduated, he returned to Limburg to settle as an independent architect in the town of Heerlen, where the booming coal mining industry provided him with many assignments. Peutz played a major role in transforming Heerlen in a true, modern city. In 1925 he received his degree in architecture. Around 1926 his first son, Victor Peutz was born, who became audiologist and acoustician. Peutz and his wife Isabelle Tissen had thirteen children together. One of whom followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps to get a degree in civil engineering and become an architect.

==Work==
Peutz incorporated various historical styles in his work. He had a special affinity with the modern movement (such as Bauhaus in Germany), with his own distinct interpretation. There is a big contrast in style between his secular work and his much more traditional churches.

During his lifetime he had quite an international reputation. But because his work was done in and around Heerlen, a city that lost its status as an industrial centre in the decades to come, he has been somewhat forgotten. But in recent years he is being rediscovered, exemplified by the proclamation of his Glaspaleis as one of the world&#x27;s 1000 most important buildings of the 20th century, and also due to Wiel Arets&#x27; – a contemporary Dutch architect also from Heerlen – many publications on Peutz produced in the past ten years. Peutz was also responsible for the adjacent Pancratiuskerk (for Monumentenzorg – &#x27;Monument Care&#x27;) and the juxtaposition between this old Romanesque church and the ultramodern department store is typical for his mixing of the old and the new.

The retreat house and the Glaspaleis are good examples of a new phase in his building style that he developed after entering a competition to design the Palais des Nations in Geneva (1926), this new style accumulated in the Town hall of Heerlen.

<doc id="767937" wikidata="Q1295754" url="?curid=767937" title="Consensus sequence">
<text>In molecular biology and bioinformatics, the consensus sequence (or canonical sequence) is the calculated sequence of most frequent residues, either nucleotide or amino acid, found at each position in a sequence alignment. It represents the results of multiple sequence alignments in which related sequences are compared to each other and similar sequence motifs are calculated. Such information is important when considering sequence-dependent enzymes such as RNA polymerase.
==Biological significance==
A protein binding site, represented by a consensus sequence, may be a short sequence of nucleotides which is found several times in the genome and is thought to play the same role in its different locations. For example, many transcription factors recognize particular patterns in the promoters of the genes they regulate. In the same way, restriction enzymes usually have palindromic consensus sequences, usually corresponding to the site where they cut the DNA. Transposons act in much the same manner in their identification of target sequences for transposition. Finally, splice sites (sequences immediately surrounding the exon-intron boundaries) can also be considered as consensus sequences.

Thus a consensus sequence is a model for a putative DNA binding site: it is obtained by aligning all known examples of a certain recognition site and defined as the idealized sequence that represents the predominant base at each position. All the actual examples shouldn&#x27;t differ from the consensus by more than a few substitutions, but counting mismatches in this way can lead to inconsistencies.

Any mutation allowing a mutated nucleotide in the core promoter sequence to look more like the consensus sequence is known as an up mutation. This kind of mutation will generally make the promoter stronger, and thus the RNA polymerase forms a tighter bind to the DNA it wishes to transcribe and transcription is up-regulated. On the contrary, mutations that destroy conserved nucleotides in the consensus sequence are known as down mutations. These types of mutations down-regulate transcription since RNA polymerase can no longer bind as tightly to the core promoter sequence.

==Sequence analysis==
Developing software for pattern recognition is a major topic in genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Specific sequence motifs can function as regulatory sequences controlling biosynthesis, or as signal sequences that direct a molecule to a specific site within the cell or regulate its maturation. Since the regulatory function of these sequences is important, they are thought to be conserved across long periods of evolution. In some cases, evolutionary relatedness can be estimated by the amount of conservation of these sites.

===Notation===
The conserved sequence motifs are called consensus sequences and they show which residues are conserved and which residues are variable. Consider the following example DNA sequence:

:A[CT]N{A}YR

In this notation, A means that an A is always found in that position; [CT] stands for either C or T; N stands for any base; and {A} means any base except A. Y represents any pyrimidine, and R indicates any purine.
In this example, the notation [CT] does not give any indication of the relative frequency of C or T occurring at that position. And it is not possible to write it as a single consensus sequence e.g. ACNCCA. An alternative method of representing a consensus sequence uses a sequence logo. This is a graphical representation of the consensus sequence, in which the size of a symbol is related to the frequency that a given nucleotide (or amino acid) occurs at a certain position. In sequence logos the more conserved the residue, the larger the symbol for that residue is drawn; the less frequent, the smaller the symbol. Sequence logos can be generated using WebLogo, or using the Gestalt Workbench, a publicly available visualization tool written by Gustavo Glusman at the Institute for Systems Biology.

==Software==
Bioinformatics tools are able to calculate and visualize consensus sequences. Examples of the tools are JalView and UGENE.

<text>Radio Centraal is a Belgian &quot;underground&quot; radio station in the old city center of Antwerp. 
It began broadcasting on 31 October 1980 on 103.9 FM as one of the first pirate radio stations which started around the country in protest against the broadcasting monopoly of the national state networks. It always was and still remains an independent radio project with many experimental programmes and niche music. The station is structured as a not-for-profit organisation. The contributors are all volunteers and all the on-air talent finance the investment and cover the running costs of the project. In this way, Radio Centraal can stay independent from local government or commercial sponsors. Most programming is in Dutch, but there are many programmes in English and other languages.
The station offers a starting platform for aspiring, ambitious and creative radio broadcasters, who are given licence to experiment in sound, editorial, music, reportage and language. Several have gone on to have careers in Belgian national media. Original founder members such as Jan Balliauw and Stefan Blommaert now work at VRT television as international correspondents.

Since the studio is located close to the Steen on the river front boulevard, Radio Centraal can be said to have its fingers on the pulse of a living city. It has organised and supported many inner city cultural activities, parties and &quot;art&quot; radio projects over the years.

<text>Anders Johan Lexell (24 December 1740 – ) was a Finnish-Swedish astronomer, mathematician, and physicist who spent most of his life in Imperial Russia, where he was known as Andrei Ivanovich Leksel (Андрей Иванович Лексель).

Lexell made important discoveries in polygonometry and celestial mechanics; the latter led to a comet named in his honour. La Grande Encyclopédie states that he was the prominent mathematician of his time who contributed to spherical trigonometry with new and interesting solutions, which he took as a basis for his research of comet and planet motion. His name was given to a theorem of spherical triangles.

Lexell was one of the most prolific members of the Russian Academy of Sciences at that time, having published 66 papers in 16 years of his work there. A statement attributed to Leonhard Euler expresses high approval of Lexell&#x27;s works: &quot;Besides Lexell, such a paper could only be written by D&#x27;Alambert or me&quot;. Daniel Bernoulli also praised his work, writing in a letter to Johann Euler &quot;I like Lexell&#x27;s works, they are profound and interesting, and the value of them is increased even more because of his modesty, which adorns great men&quot;.

Lexell was unmarried, and kept up a close friendship with Leonhard Euler and his family. He witnessed Euler&#x27;s death at his house and succeeded Euler to the chair of the mathematics department at the Russian Academy of Sciences, but died the following year. The asteroid 2004 Lexell is named in his honour, as is the lunar crater Lexell.

==Life==

===Early years===
Anders Johan Lexell was born in Åbo (Turku) to Johan Lexell, a goldsmith and local administrative officer, and Madeleine-Catherine née Björkegren. At the age of fourteen he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Åbo and in 1760 received his Doctor of Philosophy degree with a dissertation &quot;Aphorismi mathematico-physici&quot; (academic advisor Jakob Gadolin). In 1763 Lexell moved to Uppsala and worked at Uppsala University as a mathematics lecturer. From 1766 he was a professor of mathematics at the Uppsala Nautical School.

===St. Petersburg===
In 1762, Catherine the Great ascended to the Russian throne and started the politics of enlightened absolutism. She was aware of the importance of science and ordered to offer Leonhard Euler to &quot;state his conditions, as soon as he moves to St. Petersburg without delay&quot;. Soon after his return to Russia, Euler suggested that the director of the Russian Academy of Science should invite Lexell to study mathematics and its application to astronomy, especially spherical geometry. The invitation by Euler and the preparations that were made at that time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from eight locations in the vast Russian Empire made Lexell seek the opportunity to become a member of the St. Petersburg scientific community.

To be admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences, Lexell in 1768 wrote a paper on integral calculus called &quot;Methodus integrandi nonnulis aequationum exemplis illustrata&quot;. Euler was appointed to evaluate the paper and highly praised it, and Count Vladimir Orlov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences, invited Lexell to the position of mathematics adjunct, which Lexell accepted. In the same year he received permission from the Swedish king to leave Sweden, and moved to St. Petersburg.

His first task was to become familiar with the astronomical instruments that would be used in the observations of the transit of Venus. He participated in observing the 1769 transit at St. Petersburg together with Christian Mayer, who was hired by the Academy to work at the observatory while the Russian astronomers went to other locations.

Lexell made a large contribution to Lunar theory and especially to determining the parallax of the Sun from the results of observations of the transit of Venus. He earned universal recognition and, in 1771, when the Russian Academy of Sciences affiliated new members, Lexell was admitted as an Astronomy academician, he also became a member of the Academy of Stockholm and Academy of Uppsala in 1773 and 1774, and became a corresponding member of the Paris Royal Academy of Sciences.

===Foreign trip===
In 1775, the Swedish King appointed Lexell to a chair of the mathematics department at the University of Åbo with permission to stay at St. Petersburg for another three years to finish his work there; this permission was later prolonged for two more years. Hence, in 1780, Lexell was supposed to leave St. Petersburg and return to Sweden, which would have been a great loss for the Russian Academy of Sciences. Therefore, Director Domashnev proposed that Lexell travel to Germany, England, and France and then to return to St. Petersburg via Sweden. Lexell made the trip and, to the Academy&#x27;s pleasure, got a discharge from the Swedish King and returned to St. Petersburg in 1781, after more than a year of absence, very satisfied with his trip.

Sending academicians abroad was quite rare at that time (as opposed to the early years of the Russian Academy of Sciences), so Lexell willingly agreed to make the trip. He was instructed to write his itinerary, which without changes was signed by Domashnev. The aims were as follows: since Lexell would visit major observatories on his way, he should learn how they were built, note the number and types of scientific instruments used, and if he found something new and interesting he should buy the plans and design drawings. He should also learn everything about cartography and try to get new geographic, hydrographic, military, and mineralogic maps. He should also write letters to the Academy regularly to report interesting news on science, arts, and literature.

Lexell departed St. Petersburg in late July 1780 on a sailing ship and via Swinemünde arrived in Berlin, where he stayed for a month and travelled to Potsdam, seeking in vain for an audience with King Frederick II. In September he left for Bavaria, visiting Leipzig, Göttingen, and Mannheim. In October he traveled to Straßbourg and then to Paris, where he spent the winter. In March 1781 he moved to London. In August he left London for Belgium, where he visited Flanders and Brabant, then moved to the Netherlands, visited The Hague, Amsterdam, and Saardam, and then returned to Germany in September. He visited Hamburg and then boarded a ship in Kiel to sail to Sweden; he spent three days in Kopenhagen on the way. In Sweden he spent time in his native city Åbo, and also visited Stockholm, Uppsala, and Åland. In early December 1781 Lexell returned to St. Petersburg, after having travelled for almost a year and a half.

There are 28 letters in the archive of the academy that Lexell wrote during the trip to Johann Euler, while the official reports that Euler wrote to the Director of the academy, Domashnev, were lost. However, unofficial letters to Johann Euler often contain detailed descriptions of places and people whom Lexell had met, and his impressions.

===Last years===
Lexell became very attached to Leonhard Euler, who lost his sight in his last years but continued working using his elder son Johann Euler to read for him. Lexell helped Leonhard Euler greatly, especially in applying mathematics to physics and astronomy. He helped Euler to write calculations and prepare papers. On 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, during a conversation with Lexell about the newly discovered Uranus and its orbit, Euler felt sick. He died a few hours later.

After Euler&#x27;s passing, Academy Director, Princess Dashkova, appointed Lexell in 1783 Euler&#x27;s successor. Lexell became a corresponding member of the Turin Royal Academy, and the London Board of Longitude put him on the list of scientists receiving its proceedings.

Lexell did not enjoy his position for long: he died on 30 November 1784.

==Contribution to science==
Lexell is mainly known for his works in astronomy and celestial mechanics, but he also worked in almost all areas of mathematics: algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus, geometry, analytic geometry, trigonometry, and continuum mechanics. Being a mathematician and working on the main problems of mathematics, he never missed the opportunity to look into specific problems in applied science, allowing for experimental proof of theory underlying the physical phenomenon. In 16 years of his work at the Russian Academy of Sciences, he published 62 works, and 4 more with coauthors, among whom are Leonhard Euler, Johann Euler, Wolfgang Ludwig Krafft, Stephan Rumovski, and Christian Mayer.

===Differential equations===
When applying for a position at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Lexell submitted a paper called &quot;Method of analysing some differential equations, illustrated with examples&quot;, which was highly praised by Leonhard Euler in 1768. Lexell&#x27;s method is as follows: for a given nonlinear differential equation (e.g. second order) we pick an intermediate integral—a first-order differential equation with undefined coefficients and exponents. After differentiating this intermediate integral we compare it with the original equation and get the equations for the coefficients and exponents of the intermediate integral. After we express the undetermined coefficients via the known coefficients we substitute them in the intermediate integral and get two particular solutions of the original equation. Subtracting one particular solution from another we get rid of the differentials and get a general solution, which we analyse at various values of constants. The method of reducing the order of the differential equation was known at that time, but in another form. Lexell&#x27;s method was significant because it was applicable to a broad range of linear differential equations with constant coefficients that were important for physics applications. In the same year, Lexell published another article &quot;On integrating the differential equation &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;y&quot; + &quot;ba&quot;&quot;n-1&quot;&quot;d&quot;&quot;m-1&quot;&quot;ydx&quot; + &quot;ca&quot;&quot;n-2&quot;&quot;d&quot;&quot;m-2&quot;&quot;ydx&quot;&quot;2&quot; + ... + &quot;rydx&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;Xdx&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot; presenting a general highly algorithmic method of solving higher order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

Lexell also looked for criteria of integrability of differential equations. He tried to find criteria for the whole differential equations and also for separate differentials. In 1770 he derived a criterion for integrating differential function, proved it for any number of items, and found the integrability criteria for formula_1, formula_2, formula_3. His results agreed with those of Leonhard Euler but were more general and were derived without the means of calculus of variations. At Euler&#x27;s request, in 1772 Lexell communicated these results to Lagrange and Lambert.

Concurrently with Euler, Lexell worked on expanding the integrating factor method to higher order differential equations. He developed the method of integrating differential equations with two or three variables by means of the integrating factor. He stated that his method could be expanded for the case of four variables: &quot;The formulas will be more complicated, while the problems leading to such equations are rare in analysis&quot;.

Also of interest is the integration of differential equations in Lexell&#x27;s paper &quot;On reducing integral formulas to rectification of ellipses and hyperbolae&quot;, which discusses elliptic integrals and their classification, and in his paper &quot;Integrating one differential formula with logarithms and circular functions&quot;, which was reprinted in the transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences. He also integrated a few complicated differential equations in his papers on continuum mechanics, including a four-order partial differential equation in a paper about coiling a flexible plate to a circular ring.

There is an unpublished Lexell paper in the archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences with the title &quot;Methods of integration of some differential equations&quot;, in which a complete solution of the equation formula_4, now known as the , is presented.

===Polygonometry===
Polygonometry was a significant part of Lexell&#x27;s work. He used the trigonometric approach using the advance in trigonometry made mainly by Euler and presented a general method of solving simple polygons in two articles &quot;On solving rectilinear polygons&quot;. Lexell discussed two separate groups of problems: the first had the polygon defined by its sides and angles, the second with its diagonals and angles between diagonals and sides. For the problems of the first group Lexell derived two general formulas giving formula_5 equations allowing to solve a polygon with formula_5 sides. Using these theorems he derived explicit formulas for triangles and tetragons and also gave formulas for pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons. He also presented a classification of problems for tetragons, pentagons, and hexagons. For the second group of problems, Lexell showed that their solutions can be reduced to a few general rules and presented a classification of these problems, solving the corresponding combinatorial problems. In the second article he applied his general method for specific tetragons and showed how to apply his method to a polygon with any number of sides, taking a pentagon as an example.

The successor of Lexell&#x27;s trigonometric approach (as opposed to a coordinate approach) was Swiss mathematician L&#x27;Huilier. Both L&#x27;Huilier and Lexell emphasized the importance of polygonometry for theoretical and practical applications.

===Celestial mechanics and astronomy===

Lexell&#x27;s first work at the Russian Academy of Sciences was to analyse data collected from the observation of the 1769 transit of Venus. He published four papers in &quot;Novi Commentarii Academia Petropolitanae&quot; and ended his work with a monograph on determining the parallax of the Sun, published in 1772.

Lexell aided Euler in finishing his Lunar theory, and was credited as a co-author in Euler&#x27;s 1772 &quot;Theoria motuum Lunae&quot;.

After that, Lexell spent most of his effort on comet astronomy (though his first paper on calculating the orbit of a comet is dated 1770). In the next ten years he calculated the orbits of all the newly discovered comets, among them the comet which Charles Messier discovered in 1770. Lexell calculated its orbit, showed that the comet had had a much larger perihelion before the encounter with Jupiter in 1767 and predicted that after encountering Jupiter again in 1779 it would be altogether expelled from the inner Solar System. This comet was later named Lexell&#x27;s Comet.

Lexell also was the first to calculate the orbit of Uranus and to actually prove that it was a planet rather than a comet. He made preliminary calculations while travelling in Europe in 1781 based on Hershel&#x27;s and Maskelyne&#x27;s observations. Having returned to Russia, he estimated the orbit more precisely based on new observations, but due to the long orbital period it was still not enough data to prove that the orbit was not parabolic. Lexell then found the record of a star observed in 1759 by Christian Mayer in Pisces that was neither in the Flamsteed catalogues nor in the sky by the time Bode sought it. Lexell presumed that it was an earlier sighting of the same astronomical object and using this data he calculated the exact orbit, which proved to be elliptical, and proved that the new object was actually a planet. In addition to calculating the parameters of the orbit Lexell also estimated the planet&#x27;s size more precisely than his contemporaries using Mars that was in the vicinity of the new planet at that time. Lexell also noticed that the orbit of Uranus was being perturbed. He then stated that, based on his data on various comets, the size of the Solar System can be 100 AU or even more, and that it could be other planets there that perturb the orbit of Uranus (although the position of the eventual Neptune was not calculated until much later by Urbain Le Verrier).

<text>Worcester Junior College was a private junior college located in Worcester, Massachusetts. Prior to its closure in 1989, Worcester Junior College offered associate degrees in the fields of liberal arts and sciences, and was accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==History==
Worcester Junior College began in 1905 as the Worcester Youth Men&#x27;s Christian Association Institute. At the time, the organization&#x27;s only academic offering was a course in automobile mechanics. In 1919, the institute became involved in a partnership with Northeastern University, becoming the Worcester Division of the university. In 1926, the school decided to split into a preparatory school and an engineering school.

In 1938, the Institute received a charter to grant associate degrees by Charles F. Hurley, Governor of Massachusetts, and, in the same year, officially changed its name to Worcester Junior College. Some initial plans had utilized the name &quot;Alden Junior College,&quot; but Worcester Junior College was used in the official charter. In 1942, ties with Northeastern were officially dropped.

In 1956, Worcester Junior College expanded its course offerings further by including classes in business and the liberal arts. A year later, with a need for more classroom space, the school purchased the historic Dowley-Taylor House at 770 Main Street.

As early as 1960, Worcester Junior College is known to have offered baseball as part of their athletics program.

By 1972, Worcester Junior College began operating as part of the new Central New England Colleges (CNEC), which also composed of the Central New England College of Technology. The combined institution was based in Worcester, but an additional campus in nearby Westborough was constructed.

In the late 1980s, CNEC experienced major financial issues, largely caused by irregular fiscal administrative practices. In 1988, the institution was placed under the receivership of Nichols College and its head, Lowell C. Smith, was named president. Nichols quickly sought to sell the Westborough campus in order to alleviate financial burden. However, there was a real-estate bubble in the following year and buyers for the property fell through. CNEC was forced to foreclose and closed its doors officially on April 21, 1989.

Today, all records of Worcester Junior College are kept at Nichols College.

<text>Fort Tonyn, named for General Patrick Tonyn (East Florida&#x27;s Royal Governor at the time of the American Revolution), was located in present-day Nassau County, Florida, near the hamlet of Mills&#x27;s Ferry, about 25 miles up the St. Marys River. The fort was unremarkable in its day, seeing little action, and apparently was not even recognized as a fort by the British; the name appears to have been used by the Americans for this British outpost. It is remembered chiefly because it served as a way station in the only substantial campaign Florida saw during the Revolution. General Robert Howe camped near the fort with some 400 men on June 28, 1778, forcing the withdrawal of Lieutenant Thomas Brown and his loyalist East Florida Rangers, who were stationed there as the front line of defense for British East Florida. They burned the fort and retreated into Cabbage Swamp. These events occurred just prior to Colonel Elijah Clarke leading his Continental Army troops to defeat at the Battle of Alligator Creek Bridge on June 30, the only major engagement in an unsuccessful campaign to conquer British East Florida during the American Revolutionary War. 

A fort is believed to have existed at the site as late as the War of 1812.

<doc id="768000" wikidata="Q1975099" url="?curid=768000" title="Neko Majin">
<text>is a Japanese one-shot manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. Spanning eight total installments published irregularly between 1999 and 2005 in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazines &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot;, they were collected into a single &quot;kanzenban&quot; volume in April 2005. Its later portion is named , and is a self-parody of Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;.

==Plot==
The series revolves around the adventures of the Neko Majin, a race of cat-creatures who enjoy practical jokes and martial arts. At least two use &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-style attacks such as the &quot;Nekohameha&quot;, while one in particular, named &quot;Z&quot;, wears an outfit like &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;″s Son Goku, and carries a &quot;nyoi-bo&quot;. As the series transitions to &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot;, it becomes increasingly intertwined with the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; world as regular characters join the cast, including an overweight Saiyan named Onio, and Freeza&#x27;s son Kuriza. There are also guest appearances by Vegeta, Majin Boo, Son Goku and his family members.

==Characters==
:A race of magical cat-creatures, who span a variety of breeds and body-shapes, although most appear to have distinctive long ears in the manner of the author&#x27;s Cornish Rex. This series concerns three: a mixed-breed referred to only as &quot;Neko Majin Mix&quot;; , a male ; and , a disciple of Son Goku from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Mix and Z are both blue, while Mike sports calico fur; all three are of a similar, round body shape, and are drawn with angled slits for eyes. These Neko Majin possess abilities similar to &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters, such as flight and the &quot;Nekohameha&quot;, similar to the Kamehameha. They are also capable of using some magic, such as the transformation abilities demonstrated by Neko Majin Mike. The source of these abilities appears to be a ball called a Majin Orb (majin-dama), without which they lose all powers. A common trait seems to be conning visitors with various services. Mix charges 100 yen in exchange for any favor, and Z in particular dresses as a koala and charges eight dollars to take pictures with them. He has a Super Saiyan-like transformation called Super Neko Majin.
:A boy that Neko Majin Mike met about 30 years ago. He was a scrawny kid, but has since grown up to become a chubby teacher at a small local school.
:A Saiyan with the overall body-shape and facial structure as Suppaman, Parzan, and Bubibinman from Toriyama&#x27;s manga &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;. He first appears on Earth on honeymoon and desires to conquer the Earth and wipe out its inhabitants in order to make it a vacation home. He and his wife take a photo with the &quot;koala&quot; Z, but when the Neko Majin fondles his wife&#x27;s breasts, he becomes enraged and transforms into a Super Saiyan. However, he is quickly defeated. He returns with Kuriza for further encounters with Z.
:A nationally renowned fighter who is challenged by Neko Majin Z. He, too, has a girlfriend that he calls &quot;Honey&quot;. In his fight with Z, he realizes that he is no match, and tries to get out of the battle except that Honey eggs Z on.
:The son of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; villain, Freeza; he resembles his father except that his head is in the shape of a chestnut. He is called by Onio to destroy Z, but runs out of pages for the fight. He later plays soccer with the gang. He frequently mentions that Neko Majin is wasting pages with meaningless comments and battle scenes.
; Vegeta
:Vegeta is called to Earth by Kuriza and Onio, who need help to defeat Z. Vegeta discovers that the Neko Majin is surprisingly strong, but receives an &quot;urgent call&quot; that requires him to leave to another planet, despite Kuriza mentioning that his cell phone should not have signal. He vows that he will never appear in another gag manga.
; Majin Boo
: Majin Boo makes a short appearance to help when Neko Majin Z is rendered helpless by Usa Majin (the lesser-known rabbit version of Neko Majin). Every time Z was not in the scene, Boo would appear, making people think he was the Neko Majin.
; Son Goku
: Son Goku makes an appearance in the last chapter of &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot; where he spars with Z. He then tells the Neko Majin there is a new evil that he needs help to defeat at his family home. When they get there, Z learns that it is just a mouse in the pantry.

==Production==
Akira Toriyama originally drew &quot;Neko Majin&quot; as a single one-shot, enjoying the relaxed and silly feel it has. He suggested that the reason it became a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; parody was probably because he ran out of material and moved away from its original premise.

==Publication==
&quot;Neko Majin&quot; is a series of eight one-shots written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama that were published irregularly in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazines &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1999 to 2005. Although there were some similarities, it did not become a self-parody of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; until &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot;, released in the June 2001 issue of &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot;. The chapters were compiled by Shueisha into a single &quot;kanzenban&quot; volume, released on April 4, 2005. On April 4, 2013, the chapters were fully colored and the &quot;kanzenban&quot; was released digitally.

In the October 2007 issue of the North American version of &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, Viz Media included a translation of &quot;Neko Majin Z 5&quot;, simply released as &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot;.

===Chapter list===
==Other media==
In the Japanese version of the 2003 video game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2&quot;, Freeza has an alternate outfit where he assumes the form of Kuriza. Neko Majin Z appears as a secret support character in the Japanese version of &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, the character Majin Boo can be seen reading a book containing the Japanese fairy tale &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot;, with Neko Majin in the front cover.

<doc id="768002" wikidata="Q926768" url="?curid=768002" title="Tahaʻa">
<text>Tahaa (sometimes spelled as Tahaa) is an island located among the western group, the Leeward Islands, of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France in the South Pacific Ocean. The islands of Tahaa and neighboring Raiatea to the immediate south are enclosed by the same coral reef, and they may once have been a single island. At the 2022 census it had a population of 5,296. The island has an area of . Mount Ohiri is the highest mountain on the island standing at above sea level. It is also known as the &quot;Vanilla Island&quot; and produces pearls of exceptional quality.

== Etymology ==
Tahaa is spelled in Tahitian using the apostrophe (in fact a variant of it, the okina, hard to differentiate from the regular apostrophe when using small fonts) to represent the glottal stop, as promoted by the &quot;Académie Tahitienne&quot; and accepted by the territorial government. This apostrophe, however, is often omitted. In old travelogues, the transcription Oataha is sometimes used.

==History==
Tahaa was formerly called Uporu, after the island of Upolu in Samoa. Due to its proximity to Raiatea, it has been strongly dependent. But during the 18th and 19th centuries it was a strategic place in the conflict of rivalries between Raiatea and Bora Bora.

According to Polynesian legend, Tahaa and Raiatea were separated by the wagging tail of an eel, possessed by the spirit of a princess.

At the time of Captain Cook&#x27;s visits in 1769 and 1773, the island was under the occupation of Bora Bora warriors.

In 1863 a Chilean ship that was in search of slaves was shipwrecked near the town of Tiva in the southwest of the island, some of the crew members stayed and adopted local wives, which gave rise to their descendants being called the &quot;Spanish clan&quot;.

The island became a protectorate and then a French colony, and is now part of French Polynesia.

== Geography ==
There are numerous smaller islands in the reef surrounding Tahaa, particularly to the north. At least one of these islands, Moie, is privately owned.

=== Climate ===
Tahaa has a humid tropical maritime climate. In general, there are two main seasons:

The hot season, from November to April (the austral summer).

The cold season, from May to October (the austral winter).

=== Flora and fauna ===
Tahaa is covered with lush vegetation, mostly coconut trees.

Its waters are teeming with crabs, barracudas, gray sharks, Napoleon wrasses, dolphins, oysters and corals.

=== Demographics ===
The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the municipality since 1971. The law on local democracy of February 27, 2002, in its articles on the population census, introduced population censuses every five years in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Mayotte and the Wallis and Futuna Islands, which was not the case before.

For the municipality, the first comprehensive census under the new system was conducted in 2002, previous censuses having been conducted in 1996, 1988, 1983, 1983, 1977 and 1971.

==Administration==
Administratively, Tahaa and the surrounding islets emerging from the coral reef form a commune (municipality) part of the administrative subdivision of the Leeward Islands. Tahaa consists of the following associated communes:
* Faaaha
* Haamene
* Hipu
* 
* Tapuamu

The administrative centre of the commune of Tahaa is the settlement of Patio.
==Economy==
Like most Polynesian islands, Tahaa bases its economy essentially on fishing and tourism: on the motu (the thin strips of land rising from the coral reef) that surround it, especially in the north, there are numerous hotels and tourist villages, generally made up of fares or bungalows connected by wooden walkways.

Tahaa is world famous for its vanilla production, which accounts for about 80% of all Polynesian production. The island specifically cultivates the Vanilla tahitensis variety, obtained by crossing the pods of Vanilla planifolia with those of Vanilla pompona. The aroma of vanilla is so unmistakable in the air that Tahaa is also known as &quot;Vanilla Island.&quot;

Another source of income for locals is the harvesting of black pearls, facilitated by the abundance of oysters in the island&#x27;s bays.

Thanks to the lush coconut forest, copra production is also a very important activity for the local economy.

==Transport==
Tahaa and its small islets can be reached by boat and outrigger from Raiatea. The short sail drops visitors on an islet beach with a small lagoon, and in the near distance, a view of Bora Bora. These parts of the Society Islands are less modernized.

== Culture ==
An ancient tradition in Tahaa is &quot;rock fishing&quot; (tautai-taora in the local language), which was very popular, especially in the past, in the islands of Oceania. The fishermen sit in pairs in different canoes, all lined up a few dozen meters from the shore, inside the reef: in each boat, one fisherman stands at the bow and hits the surface of the sea with a large stone tied to a rope, while the other paddles towards the shore.

The fish, frightened by the noise, flee towards the shore, a few meters from where other fishermen (usually women) are waiting for them. These fishermen use their legs to prevent them from escaping and, when the fish come close, they catch them with their bare hands and load them into baskets or other canoes. Today, pebble fishing in Tahaa takes place mainly during the October festival: for the occasion, the fishing canoes are decorated with garlands of tiare, the traditional Polynesian flower.
=== Religion ===
The majority of the population is affiliated with Christianity, a legacy of European colonization and the activity of missionary groups both from various Protestant groups and the Catholic Church. The Archdiocese of Papeete controls 2 churches on the island, the Church of Saint Clement in the town of Patio in the far north (Église de Saint-Clément) and the Church of Saint Peter Celestine in Poutoru in the far south (Église de Saint-Pierre-Célestin). There are also followers of the traditional Tahitian religion on the island.

=== Sports ===
In terms of sports, Tahaa is, along with Bora Bora, Raiatea and Huahine, one of the four islands among which the , an international Polynesian canoe (vaa) competition, is held.

=== Languages ===
The official language is French, but the Tahitian language is more widely spoken in Tahiti than in Polynesia as a whole: 77% of the population speaks Tahitian in the family and more than 93% are fluent in it.

<text>The Submarine Warfare Insignia (usually known as &#x27;&quot;Dolphins&quot;&#x27;) are worn by qualified submariners.

United States Navy Officers and Enlisted Sailors wear a uniform breast pin to indicate that they are qualified in submarines. 

The &quot;Submarine Warfare Insignia&quot; is considered one of the Navy&#x27;s three major enlisted warfare pins, along with the Surface Warfare Badge and the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist insignia. To earn the right to wear &quot;dolphins&quot;, prospective submariners complete an extensive qualification process that lasts about one year (for both enlisted and officers, though the two programs differ significantly) and covers all of the submarine&#x27;s systems.

== History ==
On 13 June 1923, Captain Ernest J. King, Commander, Submarine Division Three (later Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations during World War II), suggested to the Secretary of the Navy (Bureau of Navigation) that a distinguishing device for qualified submariners be adopted. He submitted a pen-and-ink sketch of his own showing a shield mounted on the beam ends of a submarine, with dolphins forward of, and abaft, the conning tower. The suggestion was strongly endorsed by Commander Submarine Division Atlantic.

Over the next several months the Bureau of Navigation (now known as BUPERS) solicited additional designs from several sources. Some combined a submarine with a shark motif. Others showed submarines and dolphins, and still others used a shield design. A Philadelphia firm, which had done work for the Navy in the field of United States Naval Academy class rings, was approached by the Bureau of Navigation with the request that it design a suitable badge.

Two designs were submitted by the firm, but these were ultimately combined into a single design. It was a bow view of a submarine, proceeding on the surface, with bow planes rigged for diving, flanked by dolphins (in the form of artistically stylized heraldic dolphins), in a horizontal position with their heads resting on the upper edge of the bow planes.

Today a similar design is used: two Mahi-mahi, commonly known as dolphin fish, flanking the bow and conning tower of a submarine. On 20 March 1924, the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation recommended to the Secretary of the Navy that the design be adopted. The recommendation was accepted by Theodore Roosevelt Jr., Acting Secretary of the Navy.

Originally, the submarine insignia was to be worn by officers and men qualified in submarine duty only when attached to submarine units or submarine command organizations. The right to wear the pin was revoked if the service member transferred to a non-submarine billet. In 1941 the Uniform Regulations were modified to permit a service member to wear the submarine insignia for the duration of his career, once so authorized.

=== Appearance ===
The officers&#x27; insignia was at first a bronze, gold-plated metal pin, worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons and medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered insignia sewn on the outside of the right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow. The device was two and three-quarters inches long, embroidered in white silk for blue clothing and vice versa. In 1943, the Uniform Regulations were modified to provide that

&quot;Enlisted men, who are qualified and subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, may wear enlisted submarine insignia on the left breast until they qualify as submarine officers, at which time this insignia would be replaced by the officers&#x27; submarine pin.&quot;

In mid-1947, the embroidered device shifted from the sleeve of the enlisted men&#x27;s jumper to above the left breast pocket. A change to the Uniform Regulations dated 21 September 1950 authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to the pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver-plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).

Over the years a number of minor design variations, particularly in the appearance of the bow waves, have occurred. Various unofficial or commemorative badges based on the device have also been made, and may have occasionally been worn with the tacit approval of local naval authorities. The 1971 &quot;diesel boats forever&quot; pin would be an example of this type.

In the modern Navy, the submarine pin is either a silver or gold chest pin, worn above all ribbons unless a second superseding qualification has been achieved in which case the submarine pin is worn below ribbons on the breast pocket. An embroidered patch, rather than the pin, is worn above the left breast pocket of working uniforms.

== Basic enlisted submarine qualifications ==

Upon reporting to their first submarine the unqualified submarine sailor completes a few days of education and is then assigned a Qualification Card, a qualification due date, and a command sponsor (informally known as Sea Dad or Sea Mom). The assigned sponsor monitors the non-qual&#x27;s (qualifier&#x27;s) progress during the qualification process and their adaptation to life aboard the boat. No one is exempted from the qualification process and no concessions are made to rank or rate.

Although submarine qualification methodology has changed throughout the decades, the basic goal has remained: 1) to provide the submarine sailor with a basic knowledge of all systems on board, their uses, operations, and interrelationships with other systems and 2) to ensure all personnel can operate effectively under pressure in shipboard situations. Submarine damage control techniques are stressed throughout the qualification process.

Progress is tracked by a First Class Petty Officer deemed as the Ship&#x27;s Qualification Coordinator. Each item on the qualification card is worth a specified number of points; unqualified sailors must obtain a predetermined number of points per week. Failure to achieve the required number results in placement on a &quot;delinquent list&quot; and the assignment of additional study, monitored by their sponsor. Each system signature is weighted and each phase has a maximum number of points.

The qualifications process aboard the boat uses publications, training videos, computer programs and hands-on training with qualified personnel, but the principal focus is on the actual operation of the damage control, atmosphere control, weapons, countermeasures, reactor, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, and electronic systems on that particular submarine. Once the qualifying sailor feels he or she has the requisite knowledge for the system they will ask a designated Qualification Petty Officer (QPO — an expert on the system in question) for a &quot;checkout&quot;. The QPO will ask prepared questions concerning the system. They can also ask the sailor to draw a line diagram and explain the system in various states and configurations. If the QPO feels the sailor has met their expectations, they will sign the sailor&#x27;s card and those points will be included in the sailor&#x27;s weekly point count. If the QPO is not satisfied with the sailor&#x27;s knowledge level, they will be dismissed to study further and return once the required knowledge threshold has been met.

The qualification structure can be broken down into phases. The example listed below is only a basic guide and is not the rule for all submarines. For most phases of qualification, knowledge of basic rather than elaborate equipment operations is required, with the exception of damage control equipment and procedures. Among the most important goals of submarine qualification is providing each member of the crew, regardless of designated specialty or task, with the training to combat emergencies anywhere on the submarine. In case of fire, flooding, or other casualty, each submarine sailor must be confident that they can trust the sailor next to them to know the purpose, location, and proper use of each item of damage control equipment, as well as the location and operation of isolations for each electrical/air/hydraulic system.

=== Block Reviews and Walkthroughs ===
Each phase (or &quot;block&quot;) of the qualification card has an overall &quot;block review&quot; where the qualifier ties in all the phase&#x27;s systems and is verbally tested for their level of knowledge.

After completion of all blocks, the qualifier must complete compartment walkthroughs, where a senior, qualified sailor quizzes the qualifier as they walk through the submarine. If all walkthroughs are completed successfully, the qualifier&#x27;s chain of command recommends that they be examined by a qualification board.

=== The &quot;Qual Board&quot; ===
This is the most dreaded part of the new qualifier&#x27;s qualification process. The board is made up of a submarine-qualified officer, a chief petty officer and a petty officer. Submarine damage control is the biggest factor discussed during the board.

During the board, the examinee may be asked to draw and explain any of the systems they have learned about during the qualification process. After the board the examinee is dismissed and evaluated by the members of the board. If the examinee passes the board, they are then recommended for qualification to the commanding officer of the submarine.

Some boats have implemented an idea requiring the qualifier to perform on their feet, called a &quot;Snapshot Board&quot;. Qualified personnel set simulations for the qualifier to treat as a real casualty. They have to make initial emergency report then lead the fight against the casualty. This type of board was formed to assure the qualifier has practical knowledge, not just &quot;book smarts&quot;.

The commanding officer reviews the board&#x27;s recommendation, and, upon concurrence, the newly qualified individual is presented their &quot;Dolphins&quot; by the skipper and designated as &quot;Qualified in Submarines&quot;. The Dolphins presentation is considered an important event as it means the newly qualified submariner will be treated as a full member of the submarine crew. Although not condoned by senior supervisory personnel, the tradition of &quot;tacking on&quot; the decoration, whereby other qualified sailors punch the dolphin badge while worn on the newly qualified sailors breast is a time-honored tradition, done in much the same way as &quot;tacking on&quot; the decoration of newly promoted 3rd Class Petty Officers has been tolerated.

Appropriate annotations are made in the new submariner&#x27;s service jacket to reflect qualification. Submarine qualified personnel are designated &quot;SS&quot; after the rate, such as STS1(SS) or MMN2(SS). The &quot;SS&quot; stands for submarine specialist.

=== Post-qualification life ===
After the sailor is designated &quot;Qualified in Submarines&quot;, they are treated with a greater amount of respect and given more responsibility. They are required to continually qualify in areas other than their primary duty. This is to ensure in-depth cross-training is accomplished. This process continues throughout a submarine sailor&#x27;s tour. In addition to the basic submarine qualification process and their requirement to qualify in their most senior in-rate watch station, a submarine sailor usually will become qualified in numerous in-port and at-sea watch stations not directly related to their own specific rating.

When a submarine sailor ordered to serve a tour ashore returns to sea duty (or whenever ordered from a boat to another submarine of a class on which they have not already sailed and earned their qualifications), they are again required to &quot;re-qualify&quot; on the new submarine. This qualification is normally completed by a walkthrough check with a senior qualified member of their chain of command or a submarine-qualified officer.

== Officer submarine qualifications ==
In principle, the officer submarine qualifications are very similar to the enlisted submarine qualifications - they are designed to ensure that each junior officer has a basic level of knowledge of all the major systems on board the boat, and is capable of performing damage control efforts throughout the submarine. However, the Officer Qualification goes well beyond the basics of system knowledge and damage control that are required for enlisted personnel. The Officer Qualification is based heavily on the officer&#x27;s ability to drive, and fight, the ship.

The newly reported junior officer (JO) starts with smaller qualifications, including &quot;Basic Engineering Qualifications&quot;, Battery Charging Line-up Officer, Rig for Dive Officer and Periscope Operator. These initial qualifications enable the JO to support their fellow officers by performing important (but tedious and sometimes time-intensive) tasks.

While the various qualification cards that compose the officer&#x27;s qualification package are usually pursued in parallel, the focus for the first few months aboard is decidedly engineering. After having completed a year of nuclear power training, the new JO will learn the engineering systems of their new submarine and qualify as Engineering Officer of the Watch (EOOW) and Engineering Duty Officer (EDO). These are, respectively, the underway and in-port watch stations ultimately responsible for the supervision, maintenance, and safe operation of the submarine&#x27;s nuclear power plant and associated engineering systems.

With EOOW and EDO under their belt, the JO can pursue tactical (or &quot;forward&quot;) qualifications. First comes Contact Manager, the officer or senior enlisted who assists the Officer of the Deck (OOD) track other vessels and maintain safe navigation surfaced or submerged. Next comes part of the qualifications for Diving Officer of the Watch (DOOW), the officer or senior enlisted who supervises the Ship&#x27;s Control Party in safely driving the ship and properly executing casualty procedures. Upon completion of EOOW and DOOW, the JO has acquired most of the systems knowledge and will focus on their tactical development.

Finally, the JO will complete their officer of the deck (OOD) and ship&#x27;s duty officer (SDO) qualifications. (The OOD qualification is actually two qualifications, one for when the submarine is surfaced and one for when it is submerged.) Like EOOW and EDO, the OOD and SDO are the officers who supervise the ship&#x27;s operations underway and in-port. They are at all times the direct representative of the submarine&#x27;s commanding officer, acting on their behalf whether it be tactical employment or in-port force protection.

As with the enlisted qualifications, upon completion of their Qualification Card, the junior officer must complete a Qualification Board, although by this point they have already stood half a dozen qualification boards for their subordinate qualifications. In an officer&#x27;s case, the board is led by the commanding officer. Finally, the officer must be observed by an officer of command rank other than their commanding officer, in performing the duties of OOD, including the taking of the ship to sea and returning to port and docking. If the junior officer passes their Qualification Board, the commanding officer recommends to the squadron commodore (a post-command officer) that the junior officer be qualified in submarines.

== Medical Officer ==

To be a candidate for designation as a submarine medical officer must be a graduate of a prescribed undersea medical officer’s course given at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute; successfully pass a comprehensive qualification examination to be completed during the first undersea medical assignment; prepare an acceptable thesis, technical paper, or project on some phase of undersea medicine; complete a submarine qualification card supplied by NUMI; and have served on board a submarine for a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutive); and be recommended by the commanding officer (CO) and (where appropriate) by the CO of the operational unit to which assigned for additional duty (e.g., squadron commander).

== Supply Officer ==

Requirements for designation as “Supply Corps Officer, Qualified in Submarines” are to serve on board an operational submarine at least 1 year; complete qualification as Diving Officer of the Watch/General Submarines; be an effective Supply Corps Officer; successfully pass Logistics Management Assessment (LMA); display basic knowledge of ship systems, equipment, and capabilities; perform as a member of the Fire Control Party; have knowledge and ability to perform casualty, damage control, and organize and direct submarine escape procedures; satisfactory leadership qualities and temperament suited to submarine duty; and pass Verbal Qualification Board by superior command. Supply Officers should normally complete qualification within two years.

== Engineering Duty Officer ==

Requirements for designation as Submarine Engineering Duty Officer includes completing the Submarine Officer Basic Course; completing an SSBN Patrol for a total of 13 weeks are devoted to participation in submarine operations as a member of ship’s company in order to gain experience in submarine systems, equipment, and operations; observe and participate in the extensive industrial effort required to prepare the ship for extended operations; assist in preparation of the work package for the next availability following the officer’s shipboard assignment; as a minimum, the candidate should complete Diving Officer of the Watch Qualification during assignment(s) to the submarine; Qualification as Officer of the Deck is encouraged; must also complete Nuclear Ship Superintendent Qualification; complete Industrial Training for 1 year in a submarine related waterfront assignment at a nuclear shipyard or SOS is required; and complete a Qualification Journal. The candidate will then be ordered to Washington, DC for an oral examination by a board appointed by the CHNAVPERS and composed of at least three submarine qualified captains, one of whom must be an Unrestricted Line Officer. 

== Unofficial Submarine Insignia ==

The U.S. Navy Submarine Force has unofficial badges that are part of the submarine heritage. When qualifying aboard the Seawolf-class submarine, an unofficial insignia is awarded that features the SSN-21 class submarine in the center of the insignia.

== Other countries&#x27; insignia ==
=== Australia ===
In the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service, sailors who qualify as submariners are awarded a badge depicting two dolphins and a crown. This badge (known as a sailor&#x27;s &#x27;dolphins&#x27;) was designed by Commander Alan McIntosh and was introduced in 1966.

=== United Kingdom ===

The British Royal Navy Submarine Service first issued badges to crew members during the 1950s, and adopted the current badge depicting two dolphins and a crowned anchor in 1972. The &quot;dolphin&quot; is a second specialization earned after completing initial training in a chosen trade.

=== France ===
The French Navy has three levels of badges:
* Basic level: For beginners in the world of submariners, who have succeeded in a course and the final exam (&quot;Certificat Elementaire de sous-marinier&quot; or CE)
* Superior level: For confirmed submariners who have succeeded in the exam (&quot;Certificat Supérieur de sous-marinier&quot; or CS)
* Officer in command: For actual or former officers in command of submarine (&quot;Commandant de sous-marin&quot;)
The first two can be worn by officers or enlisted.

<doc id="768016" wikidata="Q7392971" url="?curid=768016" title="SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia">
<text>The SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia is a uniform breast pin worn by officers and enlisted sailors of the United States Navy&#x27;s submarine service who have completed strategic deterrent patrols in nuclear ballistic or cruise missile submarines. It is awarded for different criteria than the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia awarded for submarine patrols during World War II.
Design of the SSBN pin shows a silver &quot;Lafayette&quot;-class submarine with superimposed Polaris missile and electron rings which signify the armament and nuclear-powered characteristics of the Fleet Ballistic Missile Deterrent Force. A scroll beneath the submarine holds up to six award stars, with one gold star authorized for each successful patrol, or a silver star for five successful patrols. At twenty (20) successful patrols, the SSBN pin is upgraded to a gold design. This insignia qualifies the veteran as a combat veteran, making the veteran eligible to join the VFW.

After the insignia was approved, awards were made retroactive to the first strategic deterrent patrol of USS &quot;George Washington&quot; (SSBN-598) which was completed on 21 January 1961. The strategic deterrent patrols of the five Regulus missile submarines were not initially deemed worthy of this insignia, but this decision was reversed in 2004.

The SSBN pin is worn on the left uniform pocket, typically below award ribbons. The badge is considered a &quot;secondary insignia&quot;, meaning that the badge is worn secondary to a primary warfare pin, such as the Submarine Warfare insignia. Personnel eligible to wear other secondary submarine insignias, such as the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia or the Deep Submergence Insignia, may only wear one such insignia at a time according to their personal desire. The badge does not need to be worn if the command does not require it.

<text>Non-periodic comets are seen only once. They are usually on near-parabolic orbits that will not return to the vicinity of the Sun for thousands of years, if ever.

Periodic comets usually have elongated elliptical orbits, and usually return to the vicinity of the Sun after a number of decades.

The official names of non-periodic comets begin with a &quot;C&quot;; the names of periodic comets begin with &quot;P&quot; or a number followed by &quot;P&quot;. Comets that have been lost or disappeared have names with a &quot;D&quot;. Comets whose orbit has not been determined are designated with a &quot;X&quot; prefix.

<doc id="768025" wikidata="Q337805" url="?curid=768025" title="Bao Zheng">
<text>Bao Zheng (; 5 March 999 – 3 July 1062), commonly known as Bao Gong (), was a Chinese politician during the reign of Emperor Renzong in China&#x27;s Song Dynasty. During his twenty-five years in civil service, Bao was known for his honesty and uprightness, with actions such as impeaching an uncle of Emperor Renzong&#x27;s favourite concubine and punishing powerful families. His appointment from 1057 to 1058 as the prefect of Song&#x27;s capital Kaifeng, where he initiated a number of changes to better hear the grievances of the people, made him a legendary figure. During his years in office, he gained the honorific title Justice Bao () due to his ability to defend peasants and commoners against corruption or injustice. Bao Zheng is depicted as the incarnation of the Astral God of Civil Arts (Wenquxing, 文曲星), while another protagonist — famous Northern Song warrior Di Qing as the Astral God of Military Arts (Wuquxing, 武曲星).

Bao Zheng today is honored as the cultural symbol of justice in Chinese society. His largely fictionalized &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;wuxia&quot; stories have appeared in a variety of different literary and dramatic mediums (beginning with &quot;The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants&quot;), and have enjoyed sustained popularity. In mainstream Chinese mythology, he is often portrayed wearing a judge&#x27;s zhanjiao futou hat and a crescent moon on his forehead. Some Chinese provinces later deified Judge Bao, equating him to the benevolent war god Guan Gong.

==Early life==
Bao Zheng was born into a scholar family in Shenxian (), Hefei, Luzhou (present-day Feidong County near Hefei, Anhui). Bao&#x27;s family was in the middle class, his father Bao Lingyi () was a scholar and an official, while his grandfather Bao Shi Tong () was a commoner. Though Bao&#x27;s parents could afford to send him to school, his mother had to climb up mountains to collect firewood just before she gave birth to him. As Bao grew up among low working class, he well understood people&#x27;s hardships, hated corruption and strongly desired for justice.

At the age of 29, Bao passed the highest-level imperial examination and became qualified as a Jinshi. Bao was appointed as magistrate of Jianchang County, but he deferred embarking on his official career for a decade in order to care for his elderly parents and faithfully observe proper mourning rites after their deaths.

During the time Bao looked after his parents at home, Liu Yun (), Magistrate of Luzhou who was renowned as an excellent poetic and fair-minded officer, usually visited Bao. Because the two got along well, Bao obtained great influence from Liu Yun in respect of the love for people.

==As magistrate of Tianchang==
After the passing of his parents, Bao Zheng, then 39, was appointed magistrate of Tianchang County not far from his hometown. It was here that Bao first established his reputation as an astute judge. According to an anecdote, a man once reported that his ox&#x27;s tongue had been sliced out. Bao told him to return and slaughter the ox for sale. Soon another man arrived in court and accused the first man of privately slaughtering a &quot;beast of burden&quot;, an offense punishable by a year of penal servitude. Bao bellowed: &quot;Why did you cut his ox&#x27;s tongue and then accuse him?&quot; In shock, the culprit had to confess.

==As prefect of Duanzhou==
In 1040, Bao Zheng was promoted to the prefect of Duanzhou (modern Zhaoqing) in the south, a prefecture famous for its high-quality inkstones, a certain number of which were presented annually to the imperial court. However, Bao discovered that previous prefects had collected far more inkstones from manufacturers than the required tribute—several dozens of times more—in order to bribe influential ministers with the extras. Bao abolished the practice by telling manufacturers to fill only the required quota.

When his tenure was up in 1043, Bao left without a single inkstone in his possession. It was in Duanzhou that he wrote this poem:

==As investigating censor==
Bao Zheng returned to the capital and was named an investigating censor in 1044. For the next two years in this position, Bao submitted at least 13 memoranda to Emperor Renzong of Song on military, taxation, the examination system, and governmental dishonesty and incompetence.

In 1045, Bao was sent to the Liao dynasty as a messenger. During an audience, a Liao official accused the Song of violating the peace by installing a secret side door in the border prefecture of Xiongzhou, so as to solicit defectors from Liao for intelligence. Bao retorted: &quot;Why is a side door required for intelligence?&quot; The Liao subject could not respond.

In the following years, Bao held the following positions:

* Fiscal commissioner of Hebei
* Vice Director of Ministry of Justice
* Auxiliary in the Academy of Scholarly Worthies ()
* Vice Commissioner of Ministry of Revenue

==Impeaching Zhang Yaozuo==
Emperor Renzong&#x27;s favourite consort had been Concubine Zhang, whom he had wanted to make empress but could not because of opposition by his (unknown to him, fake) mother, Empress Dowager Liu. Nevertheless, the concubine&#x27;s uncle Zhang Yaozuo () was quickly promoted within a few years from minor local posts to high office, including the state finance commissioner (). On July 12, 1050, Bao and two other censors together presented a memorandum, which in strong language accused Zhang of mediocrity and shamelessness, even attributing natural disasters to his appointments. Probably annoyed, Emperor Renzong not only did nothing to Zhang Yaozuo, he awarded Consort Zhang&#x27;s sister with a title four days later. But Bao did not give up. In another memorandum submitted by himself alone, he wrote:

Partly to appease protests by Bao and others, the emperor relieved Zhang Yaozuo as state finance commissioner, but instead appointed him a concurrent four-commission position: commissioner of palace attendants, military commissioner of Huainan, Qunmu military commissioner-in-chief (), and commissioner of Jingling Palace (). In a memorandum dated December 26, Bao voiced his strong protest and wrote:

In the next court meeting to confirm Yaozuo&#x27;s appointments, there was a heated argument in court led by seven ministers including Bao, which resulted in the emperor deciding to strip the commission of palace attendants and commission of Jingling palace from Zhang&#x27;s promotion. 

A few decades later, Zhu Bian (朱弁, 1085–1144) wrote a humorous account in his &quot;Anecdotes from Quwei&quot; (), which probably contributed to the development of future legends:

During his years in the government service, Bao had thirty high officials demoted or dismissed for corruption, bribery, or dereliction of duty. In addition, as the imperial censor, Bao avoided punishment despite many other contemporary imperial censors having been punished for minor statements.

==As prefect of Kaifeng==

In 1057, Bao was appointed the magistrate of the capital city of Bian (present day Kaifeng). Bao held the position for only one year, but he initiated several material administrative reforms, including allowing the citizens to directly lodge complaints with the city administrators, thereby bypassing the city clerks who were believed to be corrupt and in the pay of local powerful families.

Bao had also been the Minister of Finance. Despite his high rank in the government, Bao led a modest life like a commoner.

Apart from his intolerance of injustice and corruption, Bao was well known for his filial piety and his stern demeanor. In his lifetime, Bao gained the name &quot;Iron-Faced Judge&quot; () and it was also said among the public that his smile was &quot;rarer than clear waters in the Yellow River&quot;.

Due to his fame and the strength of his reputation, Bao&#x27;s name became synonymous with the idealized &quot;honest and upright official&quot; (), and quickly became a popular subject of early vernacular drama and literature. Bao was also associated with the god Yanluo (Yama) and the &quot;Infernal Bureaucracy&quot; of the Eastern Marchmount, on account of his supposed ability to judge affairs in the afterlife as well as he judged them in the realm of the living.

==Family==
Bao Zheng had two wives, Lady Zhang () and Lady Dong (). Bao had one son, , born 1033, and two daughters with Lady Dong. His only son Bao Yi died in 1053 at a relatively young age while being a government officer, two years after his marriage to Lady Cui (). Bao Yi&#x27;s son, Bao Wenfu (), died prematurely at the age of five.

However, when a young maid Lady Sun () in Bao Zheng&#x27;s family became pregnant, Bao dismissed her back to her hometown. Lady Cui, Bao Yi&#x27;s wife, knowing that the maid was pregnant with her father-in-law&#x27;s child, continued to send money and clothing to her home. Upon the birth of Lady Sun&#x27;s son named Bao Yan (包𫄧) (1057 - 1105), Lady Cui secretly brought him to her house to foster him. The following year, she brought him back to his biological father, thus enabling the continuation of Bao&#x27;s family line. Bao Zheng and his wife rejoiced, and they renamed their new son as .

Bao Yi&#x27;s wife Lady Cui was greatly praised in the official sources for her devotion to the protection of family line. This story was very influential to the formation of the legend that Bao Zheng was raised by his elder sister-in-law, whom he called &quot;sister-in-law mother&quot; ().

==Death==
Bao died in the Capital City of Kaifeng (present day Kaifeng, Henan) in 1062. It was recorded that he left the following warning for his family:

Any of my descendants who commits bribery as an official shall not be allowed back home nor buried in the family burial site. He who shares not my values is not my descendant.

Bao was buried in Daxingji in 1063. His tomb was rebuilt by officials of the Huaixi Road in 1066. Lady Dong died in 1068 and was buried next to him.

==Remains==
===Cultural Revolution period===
During the Cultural Revolution, the Baogong Temple in Baohe Park of Hefei City was looted, and the Bao Zheng statue was ruined. The Bao Zheng portraits preserved by the generations of his descendants and the Baoshi Genealogy () were burned.

The relevant personnel set up a relic rescue effort &quot;Bao Cemetery Clearing and Excavation Leading Group&quot; () to excavate and clean up the cemetery. They unearthed Bao Zheng&#x27;s remains and the two newly discovered tombstones with Chinese engravings in forms of () and (). It was found that the tombstones of Bao Zheng and Lady Dong had been displaced due to destruction. In addition, the tomb of the eldest son and his wife, the tomb of the second son and his wife, and the tomb of the grandson Bao Yongnian () were also excavated and cleaned up. The excavation group handed back the remains of Bao Zheng and his family to their descendants.

One day in August 1973, the remains of Bao Zheng and his family were carried out in 11 wooden coffin boxes and transported back to Dabaocun (), the hometown of Bao Zheng. However, the local commune secretary there would not allow their ancestors&#x27; remains to be buried on the grounds, otherwise they would be destroyed immediately.

Bao Zheng&#x27;s descendants, in fear that the remains of Bao Zheng and his family would be destroyed, with the help of a fellow 34th generation descendant Bao Zunyuan (), secretly hid them elsewhere without knowing what to do. The remains, consisting of 34 Bao Zheng&#x27;s bone fragments, would later be sent to Beijing for forensics research before they were returned to the newly reconstructed cemetery.

===Reconstructed cemetery===
The Bao Gong Cemetery () was reconstructed next to the Bao Gong Temple in Hefei in the forested area of Anhui in 1985 and was completed in 1987 to preserve the remains of Bao Zheng and artifacts from the former tombs. The exact location of Bao Zheng and his family&#x27;s remains however is unknown, known only to his descendants.

==Legends==
===Literary traditions===

Bao Zheng&#x27;s stories were retold and preserved particularly in the form of performance arts such as Chinese opera and pingshu. Written forms of his legend appeared in the Yuan Dynasty in the form of Qu. Vernacular fiction of Judge Bao was popular in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A common protagonist of gong&#x27;an fiction, Judge Bao stories revolve around Bao, a magistrate, investigating and solving criminal cases. When Sherlock Holmes was first translated into Chinese in the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese called Sherlock “the English Judge Bao.”

In the Yuan Dynasty, many plays (in the forms of &quot;qu&quot; and &quot;zaju&quot;) have featured Bao Zheng as the central character. These plays include:

* &quot;Rescriptor Bao Cleverly Investigates the Circle of Chalk&quot; () by Li Qianfu
* &quot;Rescriptor Bao Thrice Investigates the Butterfly Dream&quot; () by Guan Hanqing, English translation can be found in Yang &amp; Yang 1958
* &quot;Rescriptor Bao Cleverly Executes Court Official Lu&quot; () by Guan Hanqing, English translation can be found in Yang &amp; Yang 1958 (as &quot;The Wife-Snatcher&quot;)
* &quot;Rescriptor Bao Sells Rice at Chenzhou&quot; (), English translation can be found in Hayden 1978
* &quot;Ding-ding Dong-dong: The Ghost of the Pot&quot; (), English translation can be found in Hayden 1978
* &quot;Rescriptor Bao Cleverly Investigates the Flower of the Back Courtyard&quot; () by Zheng Tingyu, English translation can be found in Hayden 1978

Also discovered from this period include some ballads which had been translated by Wilt L. Idema in 2010.

The 16th-century novel &quot;Bao Gong An&quot; by An Yushi () (partially translated by Leon Comber in 1964) increased his popularity and added a detective element to his legends.

The 19th-century novel &quot;The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants&quot; by the storyteller Shi Yukun () (partially translated by Song Shouquan in 1997 as well as Susan Blader in 1997) added a wuxia twist to his stories.

In &quot;Pavilion of Ten Thousand Flowers&quot; (), &quot;Five Tigers Conquer the West&quot; (), &quot;Five Tigers Conquer the South&quot; () and &quot;Five Tigers Conquer the North&quot; (), four serial wuxia novels composed by Li Yutang () during Qing Dynasty, Bao Zheng, Di Qing and Yang Zongbao appear as main characters.

In &quot;What the Master Would Not Discuss&quot; (), a Qing Dynasty biji by Yuan Mei (), Bao Zheng as well as the belief that he was able to judge affairs of both human beings and supernatural beings is featured.

===Stories===
In opera or drama, he is often portrayed with a black face and a white crescent shaped birthmark on his forehead.

In legends, because he was born dark-skinned and extremely ugly, Bao Zheng was considered cursed and thrown away by his father right after birth. However, his virtuous elder sister-in-law, who just had an infant named Bao Mian (), picked Bao Zheng up and raised him like her own son. As a result, Bao Zheng would refer to Bao Mian&#x27;s mother as &quot;sister-in-law mother&quot;.

In most dramatizations of his stories, he used a set of guillotines (鍘刀, &quot;lever-knife&quot;), given to him by the emperor, to execute criminals:
* The one decorated with a dog&#x27;s head (狗頭鍘 or 犬頭鍘) was used on commoners.
* The one decorated with a tiger&#x27;s head () was used on government officials.
* The one decorated with a dragon&#x27;s head (龍頭鍘 or 火龍鍘) was used on royal personages.

He was granted a golden rod () by the previous emperor, with which he was authorized to chastise the current emperor. He was also granted an imperial sword () from the previous emperor; whenever it was exhibited to the persons surrounding, irrespective of their social classes, they must pay respect and compliance to the person exhibiting the sword as if they were the emperor (unless the person has an object of equal power). Each of Bao Zheng&#x27;s guillotines were authorized to execute the corresponding social-ranked person without first obtaining approval from the emperor, though any interference from the emperor would stop the process.

He is famous for his uncompromising stance against corruption among the government officials at the time. He upheld justice and refused to yield to higher powers including the Emperor&#x27;s Father-in-Law (), who was also appointed as the Grand Tutor () and was known as Grand Tutor Pang (). He is depicted to have treated Bao as an enemy. Although Grand Tutor Pang is often depicted in myth as an archetypical villain (arrogant, selfish, and cruel), the historical reasons for his bitter rivalry with Bao remain unclear.

Bao Zheng also managed to remain in favour by cultivating a long-standing friendship with one of Emperor Renzong&#x27;s uncles, the Eighth Imperial Prince () and Prime Minister Wang Yanling ().

In many stories Bao is usually accompanied by his skilled bodyguard Zhan Zhao () and personal secretary Gongsun Ce (). Zhan is a skilled martial artist while Gongsun is an intelligent adviser. When Sherlock Holmes was first translated into Chinese - Watson was compared to Gongsun Ce. There are also four enforcers named Wang Chao (), Ma Han (), Zhang Long (), and Zhao Hu (). All of these characters are presented as righteous and incorruptible.

Due to his strong sense of justice, he is very popular in China, especially among the peasants and the poor. He became the subject of literature and modern Chinese TV series in which his adventures and cases are featured.

=== Famous cases ===
All of these cases have been favorites in Chinese opera.

* Executing Chen Shimei (): Chen Shimei had two children with wife Qin Xianglian, when he left them behind in his hometown for the Imperial examination in the capital. After placing first, he lied about his marriage and became the emperor&#x27;s new brother-in-law. Years later, a famine forced Qin and her children to move to the capital, where they learned what happened to Chen. Qin finally found a way to meet Chen and begged him to help at least his own children. Not only did Chen refuse, he sent his servant Han Qi to kill them in order to hide his secret, but Han helped the family escape and killed himself. Desperate, Qin brought her case to Bao Zheng, who tricked Chen to the court to have him arrested. The imperial family intervened with threats, but Bao executed him nonetheless.
* Executing Bao Mian (): When Bao Zheng was an infant, he was raised by his elder sister-in-law, Wu, like a son. Years later, Wu&#x27;s only son Bao Mian became a magistrate, and was convicted of bribery and malfeasance. Finding it impossible to fulfill both Confucian concepts of loyalty and filial piety, an emotional Bao Zheng was about to reluctantly execute his nephew. In the end, the real criminals were forced to confess and Bao Mian&#x27;s sentence was commuted.
* Civet Cat Exchanged for Crown Prince (): Bao Zheng met a woman claiming to be the mother of the reigning Emperor Renzong. Dozens of years prior, she had been Consort Li, an imperial concubine of Emperor Zhenzong&#x27;s, before falling out of favour for supposedly giving birth to a bloody (and dead) civet cat. In reality, the jealous Consort Liu had plotted with eunuch Guo Huai () to secretly swap Li&#x27;s infant with a skinned civet cat minutes after the birth and ordered palace maid Kou Zhu to kill the baby. However, Kou gave the baby to chief eunuch Chen Lin (), who secretly brought the child to the Eighth Prince, a younger brother of Emperor Zhenzong. Kou was later tortured to death by Guo when Consort Liu began to suspect that the infant had survived. The child was raised by the Eighth Prince as his own son and was subsequently selected to succeed Emperor Zhenzong, who had died heirless. Due to the passage of time, gathering evidence was a challenge. With the help of a woman dressed as Kou&#x27;s ghost, Bao dressed himself as Yama, lord of Hell, to play on both Guo&#x27;s fear of the supernatural and guilt, thereby extracting his confession. When the verdict was out, the emperor was reluctant to accept Consort Li. Bao then admonished the emperor and ordered that he be beaten for lack of filial piety. The emperor&#x27;s Dragon Robe was beaten instead. Emperor Renzong eventually accepted his mother and elevated her as the new empress dowager.
* The Case of Two Nails (): Bao Zheng investigated a man&#x27;s suspicious death whose cause had been ruled as natural. After an autopsy, his coroner confirmed the earlier report that there was no injury to the whole body. At home, the coroner discussed the case with his wife, who mentioned that someone could force long steel nails into the brain without injuring the body. The next day, the coroner indeed found a long nail, and the dead man&#x27;s widow was arrested; she confessed to adultery and mariticide. Afterwards, Bao Zheng began to question the coroner&#x27;s wife and learned that the coroner is her second husband, as her first husband had died. Bao ordered his guards to go to the cemetery and unearth her first husband&#x27;s coffin. Sure enough, there was also a nail driven into the skull.
* The Case of the Black Basin (): A silk merchant by the name of Liu Shichang was on a trip home when he decided to ask for food and overnight lodging at the place of Zhao Da, the owner of a pottery kiln. Greedy for the riches carried by Liu, Zhao killed him by poisoning his dinner, burying his remains with clay in his kiln to make a black basin in order to destroy the evidence. An old man named Zhang Biegu, whom Zhao owed a debt to, soon took the basin from Zhao in lieu of cash payment. Zhang eventually encountered the Liu&#x27;s ghost, who had been possessing the basin ever since his murder, and was told the story of the latter&#x27;s cruel death at Zhao&#x27;s hands. Determined to bring the suspect to justice, Zhang soon brought the black basin to Bao Zheng&#x27;s court in Kaifeng and after several attempts, finally persuaded Liu&#x27;s ghost to tell the judge everything. As a result, Zhao was finally arrested and executed for murder.

==Modern references==

===Linguistic influence===
In modern Chinese, &quot;Bao Gong&quot; or &quot;Bao Qingtian&quot; is invoked as a metaphor or symbol of justice. There is a chain of cafes selling baozi in Singapore called Bao Today (Bao Jin Tian), which is a pun on Bao Qingtian (Justice Bao).

In the Thai language, &quot;Than Pao&quot; (; &quot;Lord Bao&quot;) has become a colloquial term for a judge. The Royal Institute of Thailand recorded the term in the &quot;Dictionary of New Words, Volume 2&quot;, published in 2009. Furthermore, the word &quot;Pao&quot; is used colloquially by the sports media to mean a referee in a game, especially a football match.

<text>Trình Minh Thế (1920 – 3 May 1955) was a Vietnamese nationalist and Cao Dai military leader during the end of the First Indochina War and the beginning of the Vietnam War.

==Early life==
Thế was born in Tây Ninh Province and raised in the Cao Đài religion. He was trained in military officer school by the Japanese Kempeitai when Japan began using Cao Đài paramilitary troops. By 1945, he was an officer in the Cao Đài militia.

==Career==
In June 1951, Thế broke from the Cao Đài hierarchy and took about 2,000 troops with him to form his own militia, the Liên Minh, devoted to combating both the French and the Việt Minh. Thế&#x27;s father and one of his brothers formed their own military group in the Liên Minh and were later killed in combat by Việt Minh.

Thế&#x27;s forces were implicated in a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon from 1951 to 1953—which were blamed on communists at the time—and may also have been responsible for the assassination of the French General Chanson at Sa Đéc in 1951.

In 1954, United States military advisor Edward Lansdale negotiated with Thế to use his militia to back up Ngô Đình Diệm and the ARVN. On 13 February 1955, Thế&#x27;s troops were officially integrated into the South Vietnamese army, where he assumed the rank of general. He led the Liên Minh on a triumphal march into Saigon.

Through Lansdale, the U.S. continued to fund Thế and other Caodaist groups. However, as the South Vietnamese government faltered, many of the militia leaders declared their open opposition to Diệm and began an attempted coup. Thế&#x27;s loyalties at this point were unclear, and it was also unclear whether the U.S. intended to support Diệm against the rebels; some said that Thế might be a realistic replacement for Diệm. However, when the Liên Minh entered Saigon again it appeared to be in response to Lansdale&#x27;s last-minute call for them to protect Diệm.

==Death==
On 3 May 1955, while standing near his military jeep, Thế was shot in the back of the head by a sniper. The murder was unsolved, with some blaming the French (who had vowed to kill Thế for years) and others blaming the South Vietnamese government.
Trình Minh Sơn, Thế&#x27;s son, claims that his father was killed from a pistol with its muzzle against his head. He also claims that he was shot by two bullets, not one bullet as stated by official media. His son says it was possible that Thế was assassinated by the South Vietnamese government to prevent him from forming the basis of a possible future opposition to the government.

<text>Estelle Parsons (born November 20, 1927) is an American actress.

After studying law, Parsons became a singer before deciding to pursue a career in acting. She worked for the television program &quot;Today&quot; and made her stage debut in 1961. During the 1960s, Parsons established her career on Broadway before progressing to film. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Blanche Barrow in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), and was also nominated for her work in &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; (1968).

Parsons worked extensively in film and theatre during the 1970s and later directed several Broadway productions. Later work included perhaps her best known role, as Beverly Harris, mother of the title character, on the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and, later, on its spinoff &quot;The Conners&quot;. She has been nominated five times for the Tony Award (four times for Lead Actress of a Play and once for Featured Actress). In 2004, Parsons was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Parsons was born in Lynn Hospital, Lynn, Massachusetts, the younger of two children born to Elinor Ingeborg (née Mattsson), a native of Sweden, and Eben Parsons, who was of English descent. Estelle&#x27;s older sister, Elaine Parsons Ruggles, was born in 1923 and died in 1996.

She attended Oak Grove School for Girls in Maine. After graduating from Connecticut College in 1949, Parsons initially studied law at Boston University School of Law, and then worked as a singer with a band before settling on an acting career in the early 1950s. In 1983, when co-starring with fellow Academy Award-winning actor Jack Lemmon in a new Ernest Thompson stage play in Los Angeles, Parsons appeared on the November 1 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, telling Johnny Carson that Lemmon had been her first boyfriend, when they were both teenagers in the 1940s.

==Career==
Parsons moved to New York City, and worked as a writer, producer and commentator for &quot;The Today Show&quot;. She made her Broadway debut in 1956 in the ensemble of the Ethel Merman musical &quot;Happy Hunting&quot;. Her Off-Broadway debut was in 1961, and she received a Theatre World Award in 1963 for her performance in &quot;Whisper into My Good Ear/Mrs. Dally Has a Lover&quot; (1962).

In 1964, Parsons won an Obie Award for Best Actress for her performance in two Off-Broadway plays, &quot;Next Time I&#x27;ll Sing to You&quot; and &quot;In the Summer House&quot;. In 1967, she starred with Stacy Keach in the premiere of Joseph Heller&#x27;s play &quot;We Bombed in New Haven&quot; at the Yale Repertory Theatre.

Parsons has received Tony Award nominations for her work in &quot;The Seven Descents of Myrtle&quot; (1968), &quot;And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little&quot; (1971), &quot;Miss Margarida&#x27;s Way&quot; (1978), &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Velocity of Autumn&quot; (2014). She played Leokadia Begbick in the American premiere of the Weill–Brecht opera, &quot;Rise and Fall of The City of Mahagonny&quot; (1970), and performed as Mrs. Peachum to Lotte Lenya&#x27;s Jenny in &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; on tour and in New York City. In 1978 she played Lady Macbeth in the Kauai Community Players production. She also played Ruth in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; on Broadway in 1981. From June 17, 2008, through May 17, 2009, she played the role of Violet Weston in &quot;&quot;. She continued playing the role during the show&#x27;s national tour beginning July 24, 2009, in Denver. 

In 1979, Parsons directed a production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at Interart Theatre in New York in which she incorporated some Spanish into the show, prompting Joseph Papp to invite her to direct at the New York Shakespeare Festival (now The Public Theatre), and becoming the first woman to do so. As a director, Parsons has a number of Broadway credits, including a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot; in 1986. Off-Broadway, she directed Dario Fo&#x27;s &quot;Orgasmo Adulto Escapes from the Zoo&quot; (1983). She served as the Artistic Director of the Actors Studio for five years, from 1998 to 2003.

In 2016, she starred in Israel Horovitz&#x27;s new play &quot;Out Of The Mouths Of Babes&quot; along with Judith Ivey directed by Barnet Kellman at The Cherry Lane Theater in New York City.

In 2004, Parsons was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

Her film career includes an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Blanche Barrow in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), and a nomination for &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; (1968). She received a BAFTA Award nomination for her role in &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; (1970), and appeared in &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970), &quot;Two People&quot; (1973), &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot; (1974), &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1974), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990) and &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; (1995).

On television, Parsons played the recurring role of Beverly Harris, the mother of the title character on &quot;Roseanne&quot;; her Beverly character is the daughter of character Nana Mary, played by fellow Academy Award winner Shelley Winters. Other television credits include appearances in &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;All In The Family&quot;, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;Open Admissions&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, as well as &quot;The UFO Incident: The Story of Betty and Barney Hill&quot; and the PBS production of &quot;June Moon&quot;. She played the part of Babe in three episodes of the second and fifth seasons of &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;.

She was honored with a Woman of Achievement Award from the Women&#x27;s Project Theater in 2009. In 2010, she appeared in London, playing psychic Helga ten Dorp in &quot;Deathtrap&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End.

Parsons&#x27; most recent Broadway appearances include &quot;Good People&quot; (2011) and &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot; (2012).

In April 2018, Parsons returned to television reprising her role as Beverly Harris, mother of Roseanne Barr&#x27;s title character, in season 10, episode 5 of &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

==Personal life==
Parsons married author Richard Gehman in 1953. They had twin daughters, reporter Abbie and actress Martha Gehman, before divorcing in 1958.

<text>The Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia is a uniform breast pin worn by officers and men of the United States Navy&#x27;s Submarine Service who have completed combat patrols during declared wars. Such patrols were last conducted during World War II. During and after the war several varieties were manufactured.

The pin shows the broadside of a &quot;Gato&quot;-class diesel submarine. A scroll beneath the submarine holds service stars, one gold star for each successful patrol after the first or a silver star for five successful patrols. Successful patrols were those so designated by fleet commanders.

The Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia is considered a &quot;secondary insignia&quot; and is typically worn in conjunction with a primary warfare badge, such as the Submarine Warfare Insignia. Personnel eligible to wear other secondary insignias, such as the SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia or the Deep Submergence Insignia, may only wear one insignia at a time according to their personal desire.

<text>The Deep Submergence Insignia is a uniform breast pin worn by officers, both men and women (1993 to 1997 before the Department of the Navy changed the policy) of the United States Navy&#x27;s submarine service who are qualified in submarines and have completed one year of regular assignment to a crewed or uncrewed deep submersible. The badge was first approved on 6 April 1981.

Examples of eligible Deep Submersible Vessels include:

* &quot;Trieste&quot;
* &quot;Trieste II&quot; (DSV-1)
* &quot;Alvin&quot; (DSV-2)
* &quot;Turtle&quot; (DSV-3)
* &quot;Sea Cliff&quot; (DSV-4)
* USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; (AGSS-555)
* NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft
* Deep Submergence Unit, Unmanned Vehicles Detachment (UMV)
* Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle &quot;Mystic&quot; (DSRV-1)
* DSRV &quot;Avalon&quot; (DSRV-2)
* Undersea Rescue Command
* Submarine Rescue Chamber
* Pressurized Rescue Module

The insignia is also authorized to a supporting deep submergence detachment. 

The Deep Submergence Insignia is issued in two grades, gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel (enlisted personnel may wear the gold pin if they have qualified officer watches). The pin shows the broadside of a &quot;Trieste&quot; in front of a vertical trident, flanked by heraldic dolphins. The badge is considered a &quot;secondary insignia&quot; and is normally worn on the left uniform pocket, beneath award ribbons and any primary warfare badges, such as the Submarine Warfare Insignia. Personnel eligible to wear other secondary insignias, such as the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia or SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia, may only wear one insignia at a time according to their personal desire.

<text>Daniel Lentz (born March 10, 1942, Latrobe, Pennsylvania, United States) is an American composer and artist.

==Biography==
Lentz achieved notability as a musician while a student at St. Vincent College and at Brandeis University, when he was awarded a fellowship in composition at Tanglewood in the summer of 1966. This was followed by a Fulbright Fellowship in Electronic Music in 1967–68, which was completed in Stockholm, Sweden. He then became a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1968. In 1970 he focused more on composing and performing. At this time he also formed a music ensemble, the California Time Machine, which toured North America and Europe.

In 1972, Lentz was the first American to win the Gaudeamus International Composers Award. Since then, he has won a number of other awards and grants. Lentz then formed and led another music ensemble, the San Andreas Fault, which made several tours of the North America and Europe performing &quot;Missa Umbrarum&quot; (Mass of Shadows) (1973) amongst other works, and released several recordings in Europe. Returning to California, Lentz formed the Daniel Lentz Group in Los Angeles. This ensemble has toured much of the world and has released a number of recordings. His 1987 album &quot;The Crack in the Bell&quot; was the first contemporary classical release from Angel/EMI Records.

As an artist Lentz creates acrylic sculptures notably his Illuminated Manuscript series., which are three-dimensional realisations (i.e. the score) of a recorded musical work by Lentz that accompanies each.

According to family lore, Lentz is of partial Seneca heritage through one of his great-grandmothers. His &quot;O-ke-wah (North American Eclipse)&quot;, a composition for 12 voices, drum, bone rasps, and bells whose first version was written in 1974, is based on a traditional Seneca ritual dance for the dead.

He has a daughter from his first marriage and now lives in Southern California.

<text>The Battle of Alligator Bridge took place on June 30, 1778, and was the only major engagement in an unsuccessful campaign to conquer British East Florida during the American Revolutionary War. A detachment of Georgia militiamen under the command of General James Screven chased Thomas Brown&#x27;s Loyalist company into a large position of British regulars established by British Major Mark Prevost and were turned back.

==Background==

The frontier between the rebel state of Georgia and the Loyal British province of East Florida was for the first three years of the American Revolutionary War the scene of ongoing raiding. Political and military leaders in Georgia believed that East Florida&#x27;s capital, St. Augustine, was vulnerable, and repeatedly promoted expeditions to capture it. The first, in 1776, fell apart when Continental Army General Charles Lee was called north shortly after it got underway. The second, in 1777, had command, supply, and logistical issues; only a company of cavalry actually entered East Florida, only to be ambushed in the Battle of Thomas Creek. Following that failure, the Georgians abandoned all their military posts south of the Satilla River.

The southernmost post in Georgia was Fort Howe (previously known as Fort Barrington), on the banks of the Altamaha River, and the northernmost Florida outpost was at Fort Tonyn, in present-day Nassau County, Florida. East Florida Governor Patrick Tonyn had under his command a regiment of rangers led by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Brown, and several hundred British Army troops under the command of Major General Augustine Prevost. Tonyn and Prevost squabbled over control of Brown&#x27;s regiment and disagreed on how the province should be defended against the recurring forays from Georgia. Prevost was under orders to stay on the defensive, while Tonyn sought a more vigorous defense. To that end Tonyn deployed Brown&#x27;s force along the St. Marys River, which (then as now) formed the border. Brown and his men, sometimes with support from Creeks and Seminoles, engaged in regular raids into southern Georgia, harassing the defenders and raiding plantations for cattle to supply some of the province&#x27;s food needs.

In February 1778 Georgia&#x27;s assembly authorized Governor John Houstoun to organize a third expedition against East Florida. He was opposed in this idea by the Continental Army&#x27;s Southern Department commander, General Robert Howe, who (like his counterpart Prevost) sought a more defensive posture. Plans began to take shape in March, taking on some urgency after Brown&#x27;s rangers captured and burned Fort Howe in a surprise attack. After this event, the Loyalists ranged freely throughout Georgia&#x27;s backcountry and began recruiting in the upcountry of Georgia and the Carolinas. These actions led Georgia&#x27;s leadership to conclude that a British invasion of the state was being planned, and military preparations began to accelerate.

In addition to land forces, both sides had coastal naval forces to marshal. Governor Tonyn deployed several ships in the Frederica River, separating Saint Simons Island from the mainland, seeking to neutralize several row galleys in the Georgia arsenal. On April 15 Colonel Samuel Elbert decided to launch an attack against three of them that were anchored near Fort Frederica, a relic of the 1740s War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. In a naval action on April 19, Elbert and the row galleys came upon the becalmed ships and captured or destroyed four of them.

== Order of Battle ==

=== United Colonies ===
The units involved in the second invasion were:

* 3rd South Carolina Regiment (South Carolina Ranger Regiment), cavalry
* Georgia Regiment of Horse Rangers
* 1st South Carolina Regiment
* 1st Georgia Regiment
* 2nd Georgia Regiment
* 3rd Georgia Regiment
* 4th Georgia Regiment
* 6th South Carolina Regiment (2nd South Carolina Rifle Regiment), rifles
* 4th South Carolina Regiment (South Carolina Artillery Regiment), artillery
* 1st and 2nd Georgia Continental Artillery Companies

=== Kingdom of Great Britain ===
The units involved in the defence of British East Florida were:

* East Florida Volunteers (Loyalists)
* 1st East Florida Militia [Regiment]
* 2nd East Florida Militia [Regiment]
* Minorca Volunteer Company, East Florida Militia
* East Florida Rangers (Loyalists)

==Prelude==
General Howe reluctantly agreed to support the expedition, and in early April Georgia&#x27;s 400 Continental troops began to move south, occupying the site of Fort Howe on April 14. Over the next month this force grew as Georgia militia and South Carolina Continentals arrived, swelling the force to some 1,300 men by early May. General Howe arrived at Fort Howe on May 10, and began organizing the march south. The conditions in the camp were unpleasant: the weather was hot, and there were frequent desertions (leading to at least 11 executions). The expedition force finally began crossing the Altamaha River on May 28 but moved very slowly, crossing the Satilla on June 21 and reaching the St. Marys River on June 26.

Governor Tonyn and General Prevost were aware of the American progress. Brown and Indian forces continued to perform reconnaissance, occasionally skirmishing with the Americans and testing the security of their camps. General Prevost moved some of his troops forward, placing most of them on the main route to St. Augustine.

At this point the expedition almost broke down because General Howe and Governor Houstoun could not agree on how to proceed. Houstoun wanted to march directly toward St. Augustine, forcing a confrontation with the main British force, while Howe wanted to first capture Fort Tonyn. With the two leaders at an impasse, Howe ordered forces he commanded toward Fort Tonyn, while the Georgia militia under Houstoun&#x27;s command stayed put. Brown, alerted to this movement, abandoned and burned the fort, retreating into the swamps toward the Nassau River. Howe occupied the ruins of Fort Tonyn on June 29. The way south from the fort led to a bridge across Alligator Creek, a Nassau River tributary about away, at which Prevost had placed detachments of the 16th and 60th Regiments and some Loyalist rangers led by Daniel McGirth. They had constructed a redoubt of logs and brush to defend the bridge. These forces, numbering about 200, were under the command of General Prevost&#x27;s younger brother, Major James Marcus Prevost.

==Battle==
On June 30 Howe sent a force of 100 cavalry under James Screven south to locate Brown. Brown ordered a company of men to circle around behind them while the rest of his men hid along the road heading south from the fort. The men Brown sent to flank the Continentals were betrayed by deserters and ambushed, with most of them captured or killed. Brown began moving down the road toward the Alligator Bridge, but was overtaken by Screven&#x27;s company shortly before he got there. As a result, Brown&#x27;s men were chased directly into the established British position at the bridge.

There was some initial confusion, because neither Screven&#x27;s nor Brown&#x27;s forces had regular uniforms, so the British regulars thought all of those arriving were Brown&#x27;s men. This changed quickly however, and a firefight broke out. Prevost&#x27;s regulars quickly took up positions and began firing on Screven&#x27;s men, while some of Brown&#x27;s men went around to come at their flank. In pitched battle, men on both sides went down, Screven was wounded, and some of the Patriot militia narrowly escaped being trapped before Screven ordered the retreat.

==Aftermath==
The next day Major Prevost moved out with his, Brown&#x27;s and McGirth&#x27;s men, and surprised a Patriot crew repairing a bridge. Rather than extending themselves, they then decided to retreat, felling trees across the road as they went. The divisions in the American camps, however, meant that there would be no further advance. The Continental forces were out of rice and appealed to the Georgia militia for supplies. The militia finally crossed the Saint Marys on July 6, adding some strength to the Continental force, which had been reduced by disease and desertion to only 400 effective soldiers. The shortage of food and the ongoing command disagreements spelled the end of the expedition, which began its retreat on July 14. This effectively ended the idea in Georgia of gaining control of East Florida. James Screven was killed in a surprise attack led by Thomas Brown in November 1778.

The site of the bridge has long been supposed to be in central Callahan, where a marker has been placed, but some historians believe that the actual site of the bridge was somewhat farther east.

<text>Walker Pass (el. ) is a mountain pass by Lake Isabella in the southern Sierra Nevada. It is located in northeastern Kern County, approximately 53 mi (85 km) ENE of Bakersfield and 10 mi (16 km) WNW of Ridgecrest. The pass provides a route between the Kern River Valley and San Joaquin Valley on the west, and the Mojave Desert on the east.

Walker Pass is a National Historic Landmark, and is under the stewardship of the Bureau of Land Management.

==History==
Walker Pass was charted as a route through the Sierra in 1834 by Joseph Rutherford Walker, a member of the Bonneville Expedition who learned of it from Native Americans. Walker returned through the pass in 1843, leading an immigrant wagon train into California. In 1845 the military surveying expedition of John C. Fremont used the pass. He suggested it be named after Walker.

Walker Pass was used in 1861 by cattlemen from the San Joaquin Valley and the Tejon region of the Tehachapi mountains to drive cattle to the silver boomtown of Aurora near Mono Lake.

The Walker Pass Lodge was built nearby in the 1930s and was a well-known rest stop before burning down around 1990.

Aside from the paved road, the pass is essentially unaltered since Walker mapped it in 1834.

==Description==
It is the highest point on State Route 178. The pass is also the southernmost crossing along the Sierra Crest, with more southerly Tehachapi Pass traditionally marking the geographic divide between the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains.

Between Walker Pass and Tioga Pass, several hours drive to the north, there is only one paved road for automobiles to cross over the Sierra Nevada. It runs from the northern end of Indian Wells Valley at the east, to the hydrologic pass between the Great Basin and the Pacific Ocean at the top of the Nine-Mile Canyon road, then west along the Sherman Pass Road.

All roads between Walker Pass and Carson Pass (State Route 88), over in distance, are subject to extended closure by winter snowfall. Walker Pass is sometimes closed due to snowfall, but due to its lower elevation these closures are for brief periods. However, most east–west traffic in the region utilizes the four-lane State Route 58 through Tehachapi Pass, located about one hour&#x27;s drive to the south.

The Pacific Crest Trail crosses at Walker Pass. A campsite situated about 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) southwest of the road pass is a popular stop for hikers and astronomers alike.

==California Historical Landmark==
The California Historical Landmark reads:

:&quot;NO. 99 WALKER&#x27;S PASS - Discovered by Joseph R. Walker, American trailblazer, who left the San Joaquin Valley through this pass in 1834. This area was traversed by topographer Edward M. Kern, after whom the Kern River was named, while accompanying the Frémont expedition of 1845. After 1860 it became a mining freight route to Owens Valley. &quot;

<text>Pullman porters were men hired to work for the railroads as porters on sleeping cars. Starting shortly after the American Civil War, George Pullman sought out former slaves to work on his sleeper cars. Their job was to carry passengers’ baggage, shine shoes, set up and maintain the sleeping berths, and serve passengers. Pullman porters served American railroads from the late 1860s until the Pullman Company ceased its United States operations on December 31, 1968, though some sleeping-car porters continued working on cars operated by the railroads themselves and, beginning in 1971, Amtrak. The Pullman Company also operated sleeping cars in Mexico from the 1880s until November 13, 1970. The term &quot;porter&quot; has been superseded in modern American usage by &quot;sleeping car attendant&quot;, with the former term being considered &quot;somewhat derogatory&quot;.

Until the 1960s, Pullman porters in the United States were almost exclusively black, and have been widely credited with contributing to the development of the black middle class in America. Under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph, Pullman porters formed the first all-black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, in 1925. The union was instrumental in the advancement of the Civil Rights Movement. Porters worked under the supervision of a Pullman conductor (distinct from the railroad&#x27;s own conductor in overall charge of the train), who was invariably white. The Pullman Company employed Mexican men as porters in Mexico.

In addition to sleeping cars, Pullman also provided parlor cars and dining cars used by some railroads which did not operate their own; the dining cars were typically staffed with African-American cooks and waiters, under the supervision of a white steward: &quot;With the advent of the dining car, it was no longer possible to have the conductor and porters do double duty: a dining car required a trained staff&quot; and &quot;depending on the train and the sophistication of the meals, a staff could consist of a dozen men.&quot; A small number of Asian Americans worked in Pullman dining cars following the 1950s. 

Pullman also employed African-American maids on deluxe trains to care for women&#x27;s needs, especially women with children; in 1926, Pullman employed about 200 maids and over 10,000 porters. Maids assisted ladies with bathing, gave manicures and dressed hair, sewed and pressed clothing, shined shoes, and helped care for children. The Central of Georgia Railway continued using this service as a selling point in their advertisements for the &quot;Nancy Hanks&quot; well into the 1950s.

==History==
Prior to the 1860s, the concept of sleeping cars on railroads had not been widely developed. George Pullman pioneered sleeping accommodations on trains, and by the late 1860s, he was hiring only African-Americans to serve as porters. After the Civil War ended in 1865 Pullman knew that there was a large pool of former slaves who would be looking for work; he also had a very clear racial conception. He was aware that most Americans, unlike the wealthy, did not have personal servants in their homes. Pullman also knew the wealthy were accustomed to being served by a liveried waiter or butler, but to staff the Pullman cars with &quot;properly humble&quot; workers in uniform was something the American middle class had never experienced. Hence, part of the appeal of traveling on sleeping cars was, in a sense, to have an upper class experience.

From the start, Pullman&#x27;s ads promoting his new sleeper service featured these porters. Initially, they were one of the features that most clearly distinguished his carriages from those of competitors, but eventually nearly all would follow his lead, hiring African-Americans as porters, cooks, waiters and Red Caps (railway station porters). According to the Museum of the American Railroad:

While the pay was very low by the standards of the day, in an era of significant racial prejudice, being a Pullman porter was one of the best jobs available for African-American men. Thus, for black men, while this was an opportunity, at the same time it was also an experience of being stereotyped as the servant class and having to take a lot of abuse. Many passengers called every porter &quot;George&quot;, as if he were George Pullman&#x27;s &quot;boy&quot; (servant), a practice that was born in the South where slaves were named after their slavemasters/owners. The only ones who protested were other men named George, who founded the Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters &quot;George&quot;, or SPCSCPG, which eventually claimed 31,000 members. Although the SPCSCPG was more interested in defending the dignity of its white members than in achieving any measure of racial justice, it nevertheless had some effects for all porters. In 1926, the SPCSCPG persuaded the Pullman Company to install small racks in each car, displaying a card with the given name of the porter on duty. Of the 12,000 porters and waiters then working for Pullman, only 362 turned out to be named George. Stanley G. Grizzle, a former Canadian porter, titled his autobiography, &quot;My Name&#x27;s Not George: The Story of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.&quot;

Porters were not paid a livable wage and needed to rely on tips to earn enough to make a living. Walter Biggs, son of a Pullman porter, spoke of memories of being a Pullman porter as told to him by his father:

The number of porters employed by railroads declined as sleeping car service dwindled in the 1960s as passenger numbers dwindled due to competition from auto and air travel, and sleeping car services were discontinued on many trains. By 1969, the ranks of the Pullman sleeping car porters had declined to 325 men with an average age of 63.

==Duties and wages==

A porter was expected to greet passengers, carry baggage, make up the sleeping berths, serve food and drinks brought from the dining car, shine shoes, and keep the cars tidy. He needed to be available night and day to wait on the passengers. He was expected to always smile; thus the porters often called the job, ironically, &quot;miles of smiles&quot;.

According to historian Greg LeRoy, &quot;A Pullman Porter was really kind of a glorified hotel maid and bellhop in what Pullman called a hotel on wheels. The Pullman Company thought of the porters as a piece of equipment, just like another button on a panelthe same as a light switch or a fan switch.&quot; Porters worked 400 hours a month or 11,000 miles, sometimes as much as 20 hours at a stretch. They were expected to arrive at work several hours early to prepare their car, on their own time; they were charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. On overnight trips, they were allocated only three to four hours of sleepand that was deducted from their pay.

A 1926 report by the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (which finally achieved recognition by the Pullman Company in 1937), using the results of a survey by the Labor Bureau, Inc., stated that the minimum monthly wage for a regular porter was $72.50, with the average being $78.11, and tips on average amounting to $58.15; however, porters had to pay for their own meals, lodging, uniforms, and shoe-shine supplies, amounting to an average of $33.82 a month. Overtime pay of 60 cents per 100 miles was paid only for monthly service in excess of 11,000 miles, or about 400 hours of road service in a month. Maids received a minimum of $70 a month, with the same overtime provision, but they received fewer tips. By contrast, Pullman conductors, who already had a recognized union to bargain for them, earned a minimum $150 a month for 240 hours&#x27; work. The company offered a health, disability, and life insurance plan for $28 a year, and paid a pension of $18 a month to porters who reached age 70 and had at least 20 years of service. The BSCP booklet also reports that in 1925 the Pullman Company paid out over $10 million in dividends to stockholders from an aggregate net company income of more than $19 million.

&quot;It didn&#x27;t pay a livable wage, but they made a living with the tips that they got, because the salary was nothing,&quot; says Lyn Hughes, founder of the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum. The porters were expected to pay for their own meals and uniforms and the company required them to pay for the shoe polish used to shine passengers&#x27; shoes daily. There was little job security, and the Pullman Company inspectors were known for suspending porters for trivial reasons.

==Characterization==
According to Larry Tye, who authored &quot;Rising from the Rails: The Pullman Porters and the Making of the Black Middle Class&quot;, George Pullman was aware that as former chattel slaves, the men he hired had already received the perfect training and &quot;knew just how to take care of any whim that a customer had&quot;. Tye further explained that Pullman was aware that there was never a question that a traveler would be embarrassed by running into one of the porters and having them remember something they had done during their trip that they did not want their wife or husband, perhaps, to know about.

Black historian and journalist Thomas Fleming began his career as a bellhop and then spent five years as a cook for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Fleming was the co-founder and executive editor of Northern California&#x27;s largest weekly African-American newspaper, the &quot;Sun-Reporter&quot;. In a weekly series of articles entitled &quot;Reflections on Black History&quot;, he wrote of the contradictions in the life of a Pullman porter:

In 2008, Amtrak became aware of The Pullman Porters National Historic Registry of African American Railroad Employees, a five-year research project conducted by Dr. Lyn Hughes, for the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum, and published in 2007. Amtrak enlisted the APR Pullman Porter Museum, and partnered with them using the registry to locate and honor surviving Porters through a series of regional ceremonies. Amtrak also attempted to locate additional survivors in order to interview them for a promotional project. A few remaining living former Pullman porters were found, all of whom were in their 90s or over 100 years old at that time. The project coordinator remarked, &quot;Even today, observers are struck by how elegant the elderly men are. When we find them, they are dapper. They are men, even at this age, who wear suits and ties.&quot;

==Unionization==

As early as 1900, Porters started to rally and organize for better wages and treatment. Porters who worked an average of 300-400 hours per month, were paid a fixed monthly wage regardless of hours or length of trips. They were also subjected to easy dismissal or termination based on minor or false accusations by mainly white passengers. Initial efforts were largely unsuccessful and also increased risk of retributory termination for attempting to unionize.

The Order of Sleeping Car Conductors was organized on February 20, 1918, in Kansas City, Missouri. Members had to be white males; because the order did not admit Black people, A. Philip Randolph began organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Using the motto &quot;Fight or Be Slaves&quot;, on August 25, 1925, 500 porters met in Harlem and decided to make an effort to organize. Under Randolph&#x27;s leadership the first black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, was formed and slowly working conditions and salaries improved.

By forming the first black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Pullman porters also laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement, which began in the 1950s. Union organizer and former Pullman porter E. D. Nixon played a crucial role in organizing the landmark Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama in 1955. It was he who bailed Rosa Parks out of jail after she refused to move on the bus, and who selected her as the figure to build the boycott around.

By the 1960s, between the decline of the passenger rail system and the cultural shifts in American society, the Pullman porters&#x27; contribution became obscured, becoming for some in the African-American community a symbol of subservience to white cultural and economic domination.

In 1978, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters merged with the larger Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks.

==Contribution to a black middle class==

The black community looked up to Pullman porters and many people credit them as significant contributors to the development of America&#x27;s black middle class. Black historian and civil-rights activist Timuel Black observed in a 2013 interview:

In the late 19th century, Pullman porters were among the only people in their communities to travel extensively. Consequently, they became a conduit of new information and ideas from the wider world to their communities. Many Pullman porters supported community projects, including schools, and saved rigorously to ensure that their children were able to obtain an education and thus better employment. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown were descendants of Pullman porters. Marshall was also a porter himself, as were Malcolm X and the photojournalist Gordon Parks. Berkeley, California Councilman, U.S. Congressman, and Oakland, California Mayor Ron Dellums was also a descendant of Pullman porters. His father was Verney Dellums, a Pullman porter and a longshoreman. His uncle, C.L. Dellums, was a leader in the Brotherhood of Pullman Car Porters union. Ron Dellums served fourteen terms as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 

==A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum==
In 1995, Lyn Hughes founded the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum to celebrate both the life of A. Philip Randolph and the role of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and other African-Americans in the U.S. labor movement. Located in South Side, Chicago and housed in one of the original rowhouses built by George Pullman to house workers, it is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior&#x27;s Pullman National Historic Landmark District. The museum houses a collection of artifacts and documents related to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Additionally, in 2001, the museum began compiling a national registry of black railroad employees who worked for the railroad from the late 1800s to 1969.

==Recognition==

In 2008, Amtrak, in partnership with the A. Philip Randolph Museum, honored Pullman porters in Chicago. Museum founder Lyn Hughes spoke at the event saying, &quot;It&#x27;s significant when an organization like Amtrak takes the time to honor those who contributed directly to its own history. It&#x27;s also very appropriate as it&#x27;s the culmination of the effort to create the Pullman Porter Registry. We started the Registry with Amtrak and now we&#x27;re coming full circle with its completion and the honoring of these great African American men.&quot; Hughes is also author of &quot;An Anthology of Respect: The Pullman Porter National Historic Registry&quot;.

In 2009, as part of Black History Month, Amtrak honored Pullman porters in Oakland, California. An AARP journalist writes, &quot;They were dignified men who did undignified labor. They made beds and cleaned toilets. They shined shoes, dusted jackets, cooked meals and washed dishes in cramped and rolling quarters.&quot; Amtrak invited five retired members of The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to speak at the event. The eldest of the five, Lee Gibson, age 98, spoke of his journey to the event (by rail) saying, &quot;It was nice. I got the service I used to give.&quot; He spoke of his years as porter with fondness saying, It was a wonderful life.&quot;

In 2009 Philadelphia honored about 20 of the 200 former Pullman employees who were still alive at that time as part of National Train Day. Speaking to Michele Norris of NPR, former cook and porter Frank Rollins, 93, said &quot;the railway wanted Southern boys to run the dining cars because &#x27;they thought they had a certain personality and a certain demeanor that satisfied the Southern passengers better than the boys who came from Chicago.&#x27;&quot; Rollins also spoke of the racist comments that black men experienced but commented on positive experiences as well. He recalled, &quot;I used to have a little speech that I&#x27;d make. I would walk into the car, and I would say, &#x27;May I have your attention please. My name is Frank Rollins. If you can&#x27;t remember that, that&#x27;s OK. You can call me porterit&#x27;s right here on the cap, you can be able to remember that. Just don&#x27;t call me &#x27;boy&#x27; and don&#x27;t call me George.

In August 2013, the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum celebrated the 50 year anniversary of the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (also known as &quot;The Great March on Washington&quot;), one of the largest political rallies for human rights in United States history. Interviewed in a neighborhood newspaper, founder Lyn Hughes suggested that some people in the Chicago area may prefer to celebrate the anniversary of the march in their own community rather than travel to Washington. She added that many people are unaware that Asa Philip Randolph was the initial activist who inspired the March on Washington Movement. Scheduled activities included speakers and screenings of films related to black labor history. Two organizers said that two former Pullman porters, Milton Jones (age 98) and Benjamin Gaines (age 90), were expected to attend.

<text>Charles Erskine Scott Wood (February 20, 1852January 22, 1944), also known as C. E. S. Wood, was an American author, civil liberties advocate, artist, soldier, attorney, and Georgist. He is best known as the author of the 1927 satirical bestseller, &quot;Heavenly Discourse&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Erie, Pennsylvania, Wood graduated from West Point in 1874. He served as a lieutenant with the 21st Infantry Regiment and fought in the Nez Perce War in 1877. He was present at the surrender of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce. It was Wood who transcribed, and perhaps embellished, Chief Joseph&#x27;s famous speech, which ended with: &quot;My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.&quot; The two men became close friends.

He raised his family in Portland at a house on King&#x27;s Hill near the northeast corner of today&#x27;s Vista Bridge. The site is now occupied by the Portland Garden Club in the Goose Hollow neighborhood. John Reed grew up a few blocks away and was greatly influenced by Wood.

==Oregon politics==
Following his service he became a prominent attorney in Portland, Oregon, where he often defended labor unions and &quot;radicals&quot; including birth control activist Margaret Sanger. He began to write, became a frequent contributor to &quot;The Pacific Monthly&quot; magazine, and was a leader of Portland&#x27;s literary community.

In 1896, Wood was Oregon&#x27;s sole representative on the national committee of the National Democratic Party, known as the Gold Democrats. The party, which had the blessing of Grover Cleveland, championed defense of the gold standard and free trade.

Like many Cleveland Democrats, including his long-time friend Mark Twain, Wood joined the American Anti-Imperialist League. The League called for the United States to grant immediate independence to the Philippines and other territories conquered in the Spanish–American War.

==Politics==
As a lawyer during the early twentieth century, Wood represented dissidents such as Emma Goldman. He wrote articles for radical journals such as &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;The Masses&quot;, and &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. He was a philosophical anarchist and declared himself as such before an Industrial Workers of the World audience.

Wood was unflagging in his opposition to state power. He advocated such causes as civil liberties for anti-war protesters, birth control, and anti-imperialism. In 1927, he wrote in &quot;Heavenly Discourse&quot; that the &quot;city of George Washington is blossoming into quite a nice little seat of empire and centralized bureaucracy. The people have a passion to &#x27;let Uncle Sam do it.&#x27; The federal courts are police courts. An entire system with an army of officials has risen on the income tax; another on prohibition. The freedom of the common man, more vital to progress than income or alcohol, has vanished.&quot;

==Artist and painter==
Wood advocated for the native peoples, but he also painted them. His love of painting generated numerous studies of landscapes and points of interest along the Oregon and California coastline. He also memorialized some of his favorite places in watercolor including Keats&#x27; grave and vistas from his home in Los Gatos, California.

His primary medium was watercolor and graphite. The Huntington Library has a good sampling of his artwork online.

==Time in Los Gatos==

From 1925 until his death in 1944, Wood lived with his second wife, Sara Bard Field, in Los Gatos in a house named &quot;The Cats&quot; or the &quot;Cats Estate&quot; located on the hill on southbound Highway 17. The house was built in 1925 on a 34-acre property, with an entry way featuring a wrought iron gate flanked by two large white cat sculptures, named Leo and Leona. The sculptures were made by sculptor Robert Paine, and an image of them is featured on the seal of the town of Los Gatos. Many famous people visited this home, including Charlie Chaplin, Eleanor Roosevelt, and John Steinbeck.

==Friends==
His friends included Ansel Adams, Albert M. Bender, Clarence Darrow, Eugene Debs, Emma Goldman, Chief Joseph, Childe Hassam, Robinson Jeffers, Margaret Sanger, and John Steinbeck.

==Death and legacy==
At the time of his death, Wood was West Point&#x27;s oldest living graduate. He was the father of Nan Wood Honeyman, Oregon&#x27;s first U. S. congresswoman.

==Portrayal in film==
Wood was portrayed by Sam Elliott in the TV movie &quot;I Will Fight No More Forever&quot;. In the film, he is a United States captain who fights in the Nez Perce War.

<doc id="768082" wikidata="Q724976" url="?curid=768082" title="Ashcan School">
<text>The Ashcan School, also called the Ash Can School, was an artistic movement in the United States during the late 19th-early 20th century that produced works portraying scenes of daily life in New York, often in the city&#x27;s poorer neighborhoods.

The artists working in this style included Robert Henri (1865–1929), George Luks (1867–1933), William Glackens (1870–1938), John Sloan (1871–1951), and Everett Shinn (1876–1953). Some of them met studying together under the realist Thomas Anshutz at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; others met in the newspaper offices of Philadelphia where they worked as illustrators. Theresa Bernstein, who studied at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, was also a part of the Ashcan School. She was friends with many of its better-known members, including Sloan with whom she co-founded the Society of Independent Artists.

The movement, which took some inspiration from Walt Whitman&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, has been seen as emblematic of the spirit of political rebellion of the period.

==Origin and development==

The Ashcan School was not an organized movement. The artists who worked in this style did not issue manifestos or even see themselves as a unified group with identical intentions or career goals. Some of the artists were politically minded, and others were apolitical. Their unity consisted of a desire to tell certain truths about the city and modern life they felt had been ignored by the suffocating influence of the Genteel Tradition in the visual arts. Robert Henri, in some ways the spiritual father of this school, &quot;wanted art to be akin to journalism... he wanted paint to be as real as mud, as the clods of horse-shit and snow, that froze on Broadway in the winter.&quot; He urged his younger friends and students to paint in the robust, unfettered, ungenteel spirit of his favorite poet, Walt Whitman, and to be unafraid of offending contemporary taste. He believed that working-class and middle-class urban settings would provide better material for modern painters than drawing rooms and salons. Having been to Paris and admired the works of Édouard Manet, Henri also urged his students to ‘’paint the everyday world in America just as it had been done in France.’’ By 1904, all of the artists relocated to New York. 

The name &quot;Ashcan school&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek reference to other &quot;schools of art&quot;. (For examples of other &quot;schools of art&quot; see :Category:Italian art movements e.g. Lucchese School and for instance School of Paris.) Its origin is in a complaint found in a radical socialist publication called &quot;The Masses&quot; in March 1916 by the cartoonist Art Young, alleging that there were too many &quot;pictures of ashcans and girls hitching up their skirts on Horatio Street.&quot; That particular reference was published in &quot;The Masses&quot; at a point at which the artists had already been working together for several years. They were amused by the reference and the name soon lost its negative connotations. The Ashcan School of artists had also been known as &quot;The Apostles of Ugliness&quot;. The term Ashcan School was originally applied in derision. The school is not so much known for innovations in technique but more for its subject matter. Common subjects were prostitutes and street urchins. The work of the Ashcan painters links them to such documentary photographers as Jacob Riis and Lewis W. Hine. Several Ashcan School painters derived from the area of print publication at a time before photography replaced hand-drawn illustrations in newspapers. They were involved in journalistic pictorial reportage before concentrating their energies on painting. George Luks once proclaimed &quot;I can paint with a shoestring dipped in pitch and lard.&quot; In the mid-1890s Robert Henri returned to Philadelphia from Paris very unimpressed by the work of the late Impressionists and with a determination to create a type of art that engaged with life. He attempted to imbue several other artists with this passion. The school has even been referred to as &quot;the revolutionary black gang&quot;, a reference to the artists&#x27; dark palette. The group was subject to attacks in the press and one of their earliest exhibitions, in 1908 at New York&#x27;s Macbeth Gallery, was a success. Since then to 1913, they would go on to participate in several key exhibitions of progressive art in New York.

Many of the most famous Ashcan works were painted in the first decade of the century at the same time in which the realist fiction of Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris was finding its audience and the muckraking journalists were calling attention to slum conditions. The first known use of the term &quot;ash can art&quot; is credited to artist Art Young in 1916. The term by that time was applied to a large number of painters beyond the original &quot;Philadelphia Five,&quot; including George Bellows, Glenn O. Coleman, Jerome Myers, Gifford Beal, Eugene Higgins, Carl Sprinchorn and Edward Hopper. (Despite his inclusion in the group by some critics, Hopper rejected their focus and never embraced the label; his depictions of city streets were painted in a different spirit, &quot;with not a single incidental ashcan in sight.&quot;) Photographers like Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine were also discussed as Ashcan artists. Like many art-historical terms, &quot;Ashcan art&quot; has sometimes been applied to so many different artists that its meaning has become diluted.

The artists of the Ashcan School rebelled against both American Impressionism and academic realism, the two most respected and commercially successful styles in the US at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to the highly polished work of artists like John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, Kenyon Cox, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, and Abbott Thayer, Ashcan works were generally darker in tone and more roughly painted. Many captured the harsher moments of modern life, portraying street kids (e.g., Henri&#x27;s &quot;Willie Gee&quot; and Bellows&#x27; &quot;Paddy Flannagan&quot;), prostitutes (e.g., Sloan&#x27;s &quot;The Haymarket&quot; and &quot;Three A.M.&quot;), alcoholics (e.g., Luks&#x27; &quot;The Old Duchess&quot;), indecorous animals (e.g., Luks&#x27; &quot;Feeding the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Woman with Goose&quot;), subways (e.g., Shinn&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Avenue Elevated After Midnight&quot;), crowded tenements (e.g., Bellows&#x27; &quot;Cliff Dwellers&quot;), washing hung out to dry (Shinn&#x27;s &quot;The Laundress&quot; and Sloan&#x27;s &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;), boisterous theaters (e.g., Glackens&#x27; &quot;Hammerstein&#x27;s Roof Garden&quot; and Shinn&#x27;s &quot;London Hippodrome&quot;), bloodied boxers (e.g., Bellows&#x27; &quot;Both Members of This Club&quot;), and wrestlers on the mat (e.g., Luks&#x27; &quot;The Wrestlers&quot;). It was their frequent, although not exclusive, focus upon poverty and the gritty realities of urban life that prompted some critics and curators to consider them too unsettling for mainstream audiences and collections.

The advent of modernism in the United States spelled the end of the Ashcan school&#x27;s provocative reputation. With the Armory Show of 1913 and the opening of more galleries in the 1910s promoting the work of Cubists, Fauves, and Expressionists, Henri and his circle began to appear tame to a younger generation. Their rebellion was over not long after it began. It was the fate of the Ashcan realists to be seen by many art lovers as too radical in 1910 and, by many more, as old-fashioned by 1920.

==Connection to &quot;The Eight&quot;==

The Ashcan school is sometimes linked to the group known as &quot;The Eight&quot;, though in fact only five members of that group (Henri, Sloan, Glackens, Luks, and Shinn) were Ashcan artists. The other three – Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, and Maurice Prendergast – painted in a very different style, and the exhibition that brought &quot;The Eight&quot; to national attention took place in 1908, several years after the beginning of the Ashcan style. However, the attention accorded the group&#x27;s well-publicized exhibition at the Macbeth Galleries in New York 1908 was such that Ashcan art gained wider exposure and greater sales and critical attention than it had known before.

The Macbeth Galleries exhibition was held to protest the restrictive exhibition policies of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design and to broadcast the need for wider opportunities to display new art of a more diverse, adventurous quality than the Academy generally permitted. When the exhibition closed in New York, where it attracted considerable attention, it toured Chicago, Toledo, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Bridgeport, and Newark in a traveling show organized by John Sloan. Reviews were mixed, but interest was high. (&quot;Big Sensation at the Art Museum, Visitors Join Throng Museum and Join Hot Discussion,&quot; one Ohio newspaper noted.) As art historian Judith Zilczer summarized the venture, &quot;In taking their art directly to the American public, The Eight demonstrated that cultural provincialism in the United States was less pervasive than contemporary and subsequent accounts of the period had inferred.&quot; Sales and exhibition opportunities for these painters increased significantly in the ensuing years.

<doc id="768087" wikidata="Q2030958" url="?curid=768087" title="The Spinners (American group)">
<text>The Spinners are an American rhythm and blues vocal group that formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1954. They enjoyed a string of hit singles and albums during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly with producer Thom Bell. The group continues to tour, without any original members, after Henry Fambrough retired in 2023.

The group is also listed as the Detroit Spinners and the Motown Spinners, due to their 1960s recordings with the Motown label. These other names were used in the UK to avoid confusion with a British folk group also called the Spinners. On June 30, 1976, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Spinners were inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2015 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

== History ==
In 1954, Billy Henderson, Henry Fambrough, Pervis Jackson, C. P. Spencer, and James Edwards formed The Domingoes in Detroit, Michigan. The friends resided in Detroit&#x27;s Herman Gardens public housing project and came together to make music.

James Edwards remained with the group for a few weeks and was replaced by Bobby Smith, who sang lead on most of the Spinners&#x27; early records and their biggest Atlantic Records hits. Spencer left the group shortly after Edwards, and later joined the Voice Masters and the Originals. George Dixon replaced Spencer, and the group renamed themselves the Spinners in 1961.

=== Early recording years: 1961–71 ===
The Spinners&#x27; first single, &quot;That&#x27;s What Girls Are Made For&quot;, was recorded under Harvey Fuqua&#x27;s Tri-Phi Records. One source stated that Fuqua sang lead vocals on the recording. The single peaked at number 27 on the Top 100 chart in August 1961. Other sources claim that Smith sang lead vocal on this track, coached by Fuqua. The group&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Love (I&#x27;m So Glad) I Found You&quot;, also featured lead vocals by Smith. This song reached number 91 that November, and was the last Tri-Phi Records single to reach the Top 100.

Sources debate the extent to which Fuqua became a member of the group during its stay at Tri-Phi. Fuqua sang lead on some of the singles and considered himself a Spinner. In the credits on Tri-Phi 1010 and 1024, the artist was credited for the first two singles and listed as &quot;Harvey (Formerly of the Moonglows and the Spinners)&quot;. However, most sources do not list him as an official member.

James Edwards&#x27;s brother, Edgar &quot;Chico&quot; Edwards, replaced Dixon in the group in 1963, at which time Tri-Phi and its entire artist roster was bought out by Fuqua&#x27;s brother-in-law, Berry Gordy of Motown Records.

In 1964, the Spinners made their debut at the Apollo Theater and were received with high favor. &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Love You&quot; hit number 35 in 1965. From 1966 to 1969, the group released one single a year, but only the 1966 single &quot;Truly Yours&quot; peaked on the &quot;Billboard 100&quot; R&amp;B chart at number 16.

With limited commercial success, Motown assigned the Spinners as road managers, chaperones, and chauffeurs for other groups, and even as shipping clerks. G. C. Cameron replaced Edgar &quot;Chico&quot; Edwards in 1967, and in 1969, the group switched to the Motown-owned V.I.P. imprint.

In 1970, after a five-year absence, they hit number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with writer-producer Stevie Wonder&#x27;s composition, (the G.C. Cameron-led) &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot; (co-written by Syreeta Wright). They charted again the following year with another Wonder song, &quot;We&#x27;ll Have It Made&quot; (led by Cameron), from their new album, &quot;2nd Time Around&quot;. However, they were their last two singles for V.I.P.

Shortly after the release of &quot;2nd Time Around&quot;, Atlantic Records recording artist Aretha Franklin suggested the group finish their Motown contract and sign with Atlantic Records. While recording an album that Stevie Wonder was producing for them, their Motown contract expired, leaving the LP unfinished. The group then made the switch, but contractual obligations prevented Cameron from leaving Motown, so he stayed on there as a solo artist. He urged his cousin, singer Philippé Wynne, to join the Spinners in his place as one of the group&#x27;s lead singers along with Bobby Smith.

=== Peak commercial success ===
When the Spinners signed to Atlantic in 1972, they were a respected but commercially unremarkable singing group who had never had a Top Ten pop hit—despite having been a recording act for over a decade. However, with songwriter Thom Bell at the helm, the Spinners charted five Top 100 singles (and two Top Tens) from their first post-Motown album, &quot;Spinners&quot; (1973), and went on to become one of the biggest soul groups of the 1970s.

The Bobby Smith-led &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot;, their first top ten hit, was actually the B-side of their first Atlantic single, the Fambrough- and Wynne-led &quot;How Could I Let You Get Away&quot;. Radio airplay for the B-side led Atlantic to flip the single over, with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; hitting number 3 and &quot;How Could I Let You Get Away&quot; reaching number 77. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; was also the Spinners&#x27; first million-selling hit single. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on October 30, 1972.

The 1973 follow-up singles &quot;Could It Be I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;, (led principally by Smith, with Wynne leading on the tune&#x27;s fade out), which was another million-seller, &quot;One of a Kind (Love Affair)&quot; (led by Wynne), and &quot;Ghetto Child&quot; (led by Fambrough and Wynne) cemented the group&#x27;s reputation, as well as further that of Bell, a noted Philly soul producer.

Following their Atlantic successes, Motown also issued a &quot;Best of the Spinners&quot; LP which featured selections from their Motown/V.I.P. recordings. They also remixed and reissued the 1970 B-side &quot;Together We Can Make Such Sweet Music&quot; (led by Smith, originally co-led by Cameron) as a 1973 A-side. In the midst of their Atlantic hits, it crawled to number 91 in the US.

The group&#x27;s 1974 follow-up album, &quot;Mighty Love&quot;, featured three Top 20 hits, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love Nobody&quot;, and the title track. Their biggest hit of the year, however, was a collaboration with Dionne Warwick, &quot;Then Came You&quot; (led by Smith, Warwick, and Wynne), which hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming each act&#x27;s first chart-topping &quot;Pop&quot; hit. The song also reached the Top 3 of &quot;Billboard&quot;′s R&amp;B and Easy Listening charts.

The Spinners hit the Top 10 twice in the next two years with the Smith and Jackson-led &quot;They Just Can&#x27;t Stop It (The Games People Play)&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; number 5) and the Wynne-led &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; number 2). &quot;Games People Play&quot; featured guest vocalist Evette L. Benton (though producer Bell disputed this in a UK-based interview, claiming Evette&#x27;s line was actually group member Henry Fambrough – his voice sped up), and led to the nickname &quot;Mister 12:45&quot; for bass singer Jackson, after his signature vocal line on the song. Now at the height of their commercial and critical popularity, the band started a scholarship program to help send one student to college per year.

=== Later years ===
Conflict and egos began emerging in the group when member Philippé Wynne wanted the group&#x27;s name changed to Philippe Wynne and the Spinners. When this was not done, Wynne left the group in January 1977 and was replaced by John Edwards, who had recorded a number of R&amp;B hits as a solo singer. Wynne had a solo career and entered the business end of music, forming a publishing group and record label. The group continued recording and scored some minor hits in 1977 and 1978. Thom Bell and the group parted ways. They contributed two songs to Bell&#x27;s film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot; and appeared in the film as a band. In 1979, Motown released a compilation album on both sides of the Atlantic. &quot;From the Vaults&quot;, (US Natural Resources label NR 4014 and in the UK on Tamla Motown STMR 9001), included the song &quot;What More Could a Boy Ask For&quot; (Fuqua &amp; Bristol), which was recorded circa 1965.

The group scored two major hits at the dawning of the new decade: in 1980 with &quot;Working My Way Back to You&quot;/&quot;Forgive Me, Girl&quot; (number two in March–April, number one UK) and &quot;Cupid&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;ve Loved You for a Long Time&quot; (number four in July–August, number four UK). The group&#x27;s last US Hot 100 hit was a remake of Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;, which peaked at number 67 in 1983. That same year, the group guest-starred as themselves on the TV sitcom &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;. In 1984, the group had their last notable R&amp;B hit with &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, from that year&#x27;s &quot;Cross Fire&quot; album. They would go on to release two further albums, in addition to performing the title track to the 1987 hit film &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, during the latter half of the 1980s, with no singles from these projects getting beyond number 70 on the R&amp;B charts.

After some years spent collaborating with Parliament-Funkadelic and working solo, Wynne died of a heart attack while performing in Oakland, California, on July 14, 1984.

In a 2014 interview, Henry Fambrough, the group&#x27;s last surviving original member, stated: &quot;Bobby (Smith) was &quot;always&quot; our &quot;major&quot; lead singer for all those years. Had &quot;always&quot; been. Always &quot;will&quot; be.&quot; Fambrough has led on several Spinners songs on which he sang or shared lead vocals, including: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Lose You&quot;, &quot;Ghetto Child&quot;, &quot;Living a Little, Laughing a Little&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Price on Happiness&quot;, &quot;Smile We Have Each Other&quot;, &quot;Just as Long as We Have Love&quot;, (a second Spinners duet with Dionne Warwick) and &quot;Now That We&#x27;re Together&quot;.

=== The Spinners today ===

After their chart career ended, the Spinners continued touring for decades. They are big draws on the oldies and nostalgia concert circuits, playing the music that made them famous. In their box set, &quot;The Chrome Collection&quot;, the Spinners were lauded by David Bowie and Elvis Costello. They were inducted on October 4, 2015, into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame and in The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. On July 27, 2006, the Spinners performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. G. C. Cameron rejoined the group as lead vocalist from 2000 to 2002 (replacing John Edwards, who left due to a stroke), but he left in 2003 to join The Temptations. Frank Washington, formerly of The Futures and The Delfonics, joined for a few years, before being replaced by Charlton Washington (no relation).

In 2004, original member Billy Henderson was dismissed from the group after suing the group&#x27;s corporation and business manager to obtain financial records. He was replaced by Harold &quot;Spike&quot; Bonhart. Henderson died due to complications from diabetes on February 2, 2007, at the age of 67. Another early member, C. P. Spencer, had already died from a heart attack on October 20, 2004.

Original member Pervis Jackson, who was still touring as a member of the group, died from cancer on August 18, 2008. The group continued for a short time as a quartet before Jessie Robert Peck (born in Queens, New York, December 17, 1968) was recruited as the group&#x27;s new bass vocalist in February 2009. In 2009, Bonhart left the Spinners and was replaced by vocalist Marvin Taylor. The group lost another member from their early days, when Edgar &quot;Chico&quot; Edwards died on December 3, 2011.

The Spinners were in the limelight again in 2003 when an Elton John track was re-issued featuring them on backing vocals. In 1977, the Spinners had recorded two versions of &quot;Are You Ready for Love&quot; at the Philadelphia studios. One had all of the Spinners, the other with only lead singer Philippé Wynne on backing vocals. Elton John was not happy with the mixes and sat on the tapes for a year before asking for them to be remixed, so they would sound easier on the ear. Finally, in 1979, the Wynne version was released as a single, but it only made it to number 42 in the UK. The track was then remixed by Ashley Beedle from Xpress-2 in 2003 after becoming a fixture in the Balearic nightclubs, and being used by Sky Sports for an advertisement. It then went to number one on the UK Singles Chart after being released on DJ Fatboy Slim&#x27;s Southern Fried Records.

In September 2011, 57 years after forming in Detroit and 50 years after &quot;That&#x27;s What Girls Are Made For&quot;, the group was announced as one of 15 final nominees for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, their first nomination, they were also nominated in 2014, 2015, and 2023. Lead singer Bobby Smith died on March 16, 2013. In 2017, the Spinners were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. Charlton Washington left the group in 2020 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by C. J. Jefferson. After years without new music, The Spinners released &quot;″Round the Block and Back Again&quot; on August 27, 2021, the first with the current lineup and the final before Fambrough&#x27;s retirement. The album had three singles: &quot;Cliché&quot;, &quot;In Holy Matrimony&quot;, and &quot;Vivid Memories&quot;.

In early 2023, Fambrough retired from the group, after almost 70 years as a member.

On May 3, 2023, after three previous nominations, the Spinners—with its classic 1970s lineup of Fambrough, Smith, Jackson, Henderson, Edwards and Wynne—were picked as inductees for the 2023 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, nearly 70 years after the group had first formed. In May 2023, the group donated hundreds of items for their performing and recording history to Motown Museum in Detroit.

On February 7, 2024, Henry Fambrough, the last original member, died of natural causes at 85.

<text>Valley of the Damned is the debut studio album by British power metal band DragonForce. In 2000, while the band was still known as DragonHeart, a demo of the same name was recorded and sent to Noise Records, subsequently gaining the band a deal with the label. It was then re-recorded in late 2002 and released as a full-length studio album on 25 February 2003, following the band&#x27;s obtainance of the deal with Noise and change in name to DragonForce. The album was set to be remastered and released with a bonus DVD on 24 September 2007, but was subsequently delayed and eventually released on 22 February 2010, along with the re-release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot;.

==Production==
The initial demo was recorded on 8 – 12 October and then mixed on 20 2000 at Thin Ice Studios with Karl Groom engineering. The rerecording for the album in 2002 mostly took place at Thin Ice Studios in Surrey, by Karl Groom, and at Lamer Luser Studios in London, by Herman Li, from May – October 2002. It was then mixed by Karl Groom, Herman Li and Sam Totman at Thin Ice Studios and mastered at Aubitt Studio by Rob Aubrey and Herman Li.

==Reception==

The AllMusic review by James Christopher Monger awarded the album 4 stars stating &quot;The debut album from U.K. power metal giants Dragonforce is a polarizing affair. Valley of the Damned could be construed as a bloated, Spinal Tap-style tribute to early-&#x27;80s fantasy-metal, and in many ways it is; however, it&#x27;s so well played and so joyously executed that it could very well reignite the entire genre... From the epic title track to the fist-pumping closer, &quot;Heart of a Dragon,&quot; the guitar pyrotechnics of Herman Li and Sam Totman light up the sky like a third world war, bending riffs into melodic submission while never overplaying. Vocalist ZP Theart has no qualms about emulating heroes like Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) and Michael Kiske (Helloween), but his lupine howls have a character all their own... Valley of the Damned may not be groundbreaking or cathartic, and lyrics like &quot;In the land of desire with your heart filled with fire you live for the right to be free/We will sail on forevermore to the land of the evening star&quot; may cross the line into heavy metal parody, but it&#x27;s undeniably entertaining, expertly played, and endlessly fun.&quot;

In 2019, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it as the 10th best power metal album of all time.

When asked about his thoughts of the album in a 2015 interview, Herman Li said:

==Track listing==
&quot;Invocation of Apocalyptic Evil&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Malignant&quot; from the soundtrack of Doom. &quot;Black Fire&quot; contains a sample of Kazunaka Yamane&#x27;s theme from the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; video game series. The 2010 remastered edition physical copy contains a bonus DVD that includes interviews with the band members and producer Karl Groom on the making of the album, live footage of &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; from their first Japanese tour in 2004, the backstage footage of the same show, two commentaries (one from Herman Li and Vadim Pruzhanov, and one from ZP Theart and Groom), and footage from the recording and mixing sessions for the album in Denmark.

<text>Heavenly Discourse is a collection of satirical essays by Charles Erskine Scott Wood, published in 1927.

== Publication ==
Wood primarily wrote poetry and serious prose. However, Max Eastman and John Reed, co-editors of the radical magazine &quot;The Masses&quot;, asked him to write something humorous for their periodical. The result was a short satirical attack on World War I named &quot;The Heavenly Dialogue&quot;, published in 1914. This became the first of a series of similar dialogues. Ten of these were published in &quot;The Masses&quot;. Following passage of the Espionage Act of 1917, &quot;The Masses&quot; was suppressed by the U. S. government on the grounds that it was detrimental to the war effort. Wood continued to write more discourses. After World War I, Max Eastman and others urged publication of the discourses in book form. In 1927, the Vanguard Press published a collection of forty-one of them under the title &quot;Heavenly Discourse&quot;.

== Content ==

The work is primarily a dialogue between Satan and God about contemporary issues. They are presented as friendly adversaries who are often in general agreement. God represents Wood&#x27;s own perspective. A variety of other characters also join the conversation, including angels, Jesus, Buddha, the Czar of Russia, Billy Sunday, Socrates, John Pierpont Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, Carrie Nation, Sappho, François Rabelais, Margaret Sanger, and Mark Twain.

Politically radical, the essays ridicule war, prudishness, patriotism, bigotry and Christian theology. Instead, they promoted bohemianism, free love, pacifism, socialism, birth control, and women&#x27;s rights. The satire of these essays mocks mainstream society and views it with skepticism. Titles of some of the discourses include &quot;Is God a Jew?,&quot; &quot;The United States Must Be Pure,&quot; and &quot;The Stupid Cannot Enter Heaven.&quot; Wood wrote &quot;Heavenly Discourse&quot; from the bourgeois radicalism of Greenwich Village of which he was a part.

In one of the essays, &quot;Billy Sunday meets God,&quot; Wood pokes at bourgeois morality by imagining Billy Sunday in Heaven, surprised and disappointed to find people he condemned there. Jesus responds to his complaints, and points out that he associated with drinkers and prostitutes.

Heavenly discourse is one of very few Western texts from this era to mention the angel Israfil of Arab folklore.

== Reception ==

Although Wood wrote extensively, this was his only work to reach a wide audience. The book had a substantial impact on Robert Paul Wolff and Todd Gitlin. Some American publications have called it a &quot;classic&quot;. Kevin Starr wrote in 2002 that &quot;Heavenly Discourse&quot; now seems &quot;pedestrian and heavy-handed&quot; but affirms that it was daring in its time.

<doc id="768107" wikidata="Q739144" url="?curid=768107" title="Brendan Shanahan">
<text>Brendan Frederick Shanahan (born January 23, 1969) is a Canadian American professional ice hockey executive and former player who serves as the president and alternate governor for the Toronto Maple Leafs, having previously served as the director of player safety for the National Hockey League (NHL). Originally drafted by the New Jersey Devils second overall in the 1987 NHL entry draft, Shanahan played in the NHL with the New Jersey Devils (two stints), St. Louis Blues, Hartford Whalers, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers.

While playing with the Red Wings, he won three Stanley Cup championships (1997, 1998, 2002). In 2017 Shanahan was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Known for his physical play and goal-scoring ability, Shanahan scored 656 goals in his NHL career spanning over 1,500 NHL games and, at the time of his retirement, was the leader among active NHL players for goals scored. Shanahan is the only player in NHL history with over 600 goals and 2,000 penalty minutes.

Competing for Canada internationally, Shanahan won a gold medal at the 1994 World Championships, 2002 Winter Olympics, and a 1991 Canada Cup championship. Having won what are considered the three most prominent team titles in ice hockey, an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship and a Stanley Cup, Shanahan is a member of the elite Triple Gold Club. Shanahan was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 8, 2013.

==Playing career==

===New Jersey Devils (1988–1991)===
Shanahan was drafted by the New Jersey Devils second overall in the 1987 NHL entry draft after Pierre Turgeon. Expectations for Shanahan were high after a stellar career with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), with whom his number 19 has been retired. In his rookie season with the Devils, in 1987–88, he scored 26 points in 65 games as an 18-year-old. The following season, in 1988–89, he improved to 22 goals and 50 points. In his third NHL season, he emerged as a point-per-game producer with 72 points in 73 games and a top scorer with the Devils; his 30 goals finished tied for second in team goal-scoring behind John MacLean. In his fourth and final year of his initial stint with the Devils in 1990–91, he scored 29 goals and 66 points. At the age of 22, Shanahan was already an established scorer in the NHL. He had also played well in the Devils&#x27; playoff runs.

===St. Louis Blues (1991–1995)===
Becoming a free agent following the 1990–91 season, Shanahan was signed by the St. Louis Blues on July 25, 1991. According to the collective bargaining agreement, he was a restricted free-agent, and therefore, the Devils were due compensation. Ordinarily, this compensation would be in the form of draft picks, but the Blues already owed four first-round draft picks to the Washington Capitals for signing defenceman Scott Stevens the previous year. The Blues made an offer for compensation that consisted of Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind&#x27;Amour and two draft picks even further down the road. However, the Devils were only interested in Scott Stevens. An arbitrator eventually decided that Stevens was to be the compensation, so Shanahan joined the Blues in exchange for Scott Stevens.

Shanahan&#x27;s first season for the Blues yielded similar statistics to his seasons with the Devils, but he reached another level in 1992–93 with 51 goals and 94 points in 71 games. He finished second in team goal-scoring to Brett Hull and third in team point-scoring overall. Continuing at that pace the next season, in 1993–94, he recorded personal bests of 52 goals, 50 assists and 102 points. In addition to leading the Blues in points, he was named to the 1994 NHL All-Star Game at mid-season and the NHL first All-Star team at the end of the year.

During the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Shanahan played three games for Düsseldorf EG of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), scoring five goals and three assists in his short stay overseas. When NHL play resumed, he continued to play well for the Blues, recording 41 points in the lockout-shortened season. In the 1995 playoffs, he led the team in scoring with nine points in five games.

===Hartford Whalers (1995–1996)===
After four seasons with the Blues, on July 27, 1995, Shanahan was traded to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for defenceman Chris Pronger, succeeding Pat Verbeek as team captain. In Shanahan&#x27;s only full season for Hartford, he scored a team-high 44 goals and 78 points and for his efforts was selected to the 1996 All-Star Game. With the uncertainty of the franchise, however, Shanahan requested a trade, and on October 9, 1996, just two games into the 1996–97 season, he was moved with Brian Glynn to the Detroit Red Wings for forward Keith Primeau, defenseman Paul Coffey, and a first-round draft pick.

===Detroit Red Wings and three Stanley Cup wins (1996–2006)===
Shanahan finished off the 1996–97 season with his usual productivity, scoring a total of 47 goals for the season, and being named to the 1997 NHL All-Star Game. In the 1997 playoffs, he also contributed with nine goals and eight assists, helping the Red Wings to their first Stanley Cup since 1955. They repeated as Cup champions the next year, despite an off season for Shanahan in which he managed just 57 points. The following season, in 1998–99, Shanahan continued at that pace with 58 points, but was still invited to another All-Star Game. Entering the 1999 playoffs as back-to-back Stanley Cup champions, the Red Wings were eliminated by the rival Colorado Avalanche. The next year, in 1999–2000, Shanahan scored 41 goals, indicating a return to his usual form, however, the Red Wings were once again eliminated by the Avalanche in the 2000 playoffs. After the season, he was named to the first All-Star team for the second time in his career. He followed up his resurgent season scoring 76 points in 2000–01, but Detroit was upset in the first round of the 2001 playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings.

The 2001–02 season was a banner one for both Shanahan and the Red Wings. Having picked up future Hall-of-Famers Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille, and Dominik Hašek in the off-season, the team was primed to win its third Cup since 1997. They cruised to victory and Shanahan continued to play a big role in their success, scoring 37 goals during the regular season and 19 points in their ultimately victorious Stanley Cup run. Shanahan also picked up an Olympic gold medal in Salt Lake City with Team Canada and was named to the second NHL All-Star team. The season was also of particular statistical significance for Shanahan, as shortly preceding his Olympic gold medal victory, he recorded his 1,000th point in the NHL after scoring two goals against Marty Turco in a 4–2 victory over the Dallas Stars on January 12, 2002. Later in the season, Shanahan also reached the 500-goal mark, scoring the game-winner against Patrick Roy in a 2–0 victory over Colorado on March 23. The win also clinched Detroit a Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the top-ranked regular season team.

In the season following Detroit&#x27;s third Stanley Cup, Shanahan scored 30 goals and 68 points and won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his humanitarian efforts. In the following season, however, his production dipped to 25 goals and 53 points, his lowest totals in 15 years. After a one-year absence due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Shanahan showed yet another return to form in 2005–06, tallying an impressive 40 goals and 81 points, third among Red Wings in scoring.

===New York Rangers (2006–2009)===
Shanahan became a free agent following the 2005–06 season and subsequently signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the New York Rangers. After completing a successful nine-year stay in Detroit, he expressed a desire to move on in his NHL career, stating, &quot;It really came down to an instinct I had. Detroit has a great past and a great future ahead of them as well, but I guess I just felt that maybe I was identified with the past a little bit more than the future.&quot;
Shanahan began his Rangers career by scoring his 599th and 600th career goals against Olaf Kölzig on October 5, 2006, in a 5–3 season-opening win against the Washington Capitals at Madison Square Garden. With assists coming from Petr Průcha on both goals, he became just the 15th player in NHL history to reach the 600-goal mark. Shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2006, Shanahan received the inaugural Mark Messier Leadership Award, an award given monthly to a player selected by Mark Messier who best exemplifies leadership skills on and off the ice. Then, selected to his eighth All-Star Game, he was named captain of the Eastern Conference for the 2007 All-Star Game. On February 1, 2007, he made headlines after expressing frustration in a press conference about his perception that NHL referees are biased against team captain Jaromír Jágr. Later in the month, he was involved in a severe on-ice collision with Philadelphia Flyers forward and former Red Wings teammate Mike Knuble in a game on February 17. Shanahan and Knuble caught each other skating in opposite directions as Shanahan was headed for the bench, at which point Shanahan hit his head on the ice and was left unconscious for ten minutes. He was carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital where he was released the next day. After missing 15 games, Shanahan returned to the lineup in time for the 2007 playoffs, where the Rangers were defeated by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round. Shanahan completed his first season with the Rangers fourth in team scoring with 62 points in 67 games as an alternate captain to Jágr.

After re-signing to another one-year contract with the Rangers, Shanahan struggled to produce offensively as his points total dipped to just 46 points in 2007–08, his lowest total since his rookie season in 1987–88. With his contract expiring in the off-season, he was not tendered an offer by the Rangers, believed to be a result of the Rangers&#x27; pursuit of free agent Mats Sundin.

===Return to New Jersey (2009)===
Unable to come to terms with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was announced that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan&#x27;s departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan&#x27;s sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, &quot;When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside.&quot; Shanahan had played just four preseason games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils&#x27; last preseason goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.

===Legacy===
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Shanahan was the mastermind of what was dubbed &quot;The Shanahan Summit,&quot; a two-day conference in Toronto. It gathered players, coaches and other influential voices to discuss improvements to the flow and tempo of the game. Ten recommendations were presented to both the NHL and National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA).

At the time of his retirement, Shanahan led active NHL players in Gordie Howe hat tricks with 17. Not all teams have kept records of this feat, however, and it is even believed that Gordie Howe himself only officially had two. According to a Yahoo! Sports article, Shanahan would choose to go into the Hall of Fame as a Red Wing, if he had to choose.

==Executive career==

===National Hockey League===
On November 17, 2009, Shanahan officially announced his retirement after 21 years in the NHL. Shanahan said, &quot;I would like to thank my family and all of the friends who have helped me achieve and maintain my childhood dream of playing in the National Hockey League,&quot; Shanahan said in a news release. &quot;I am enormously grateful to all of my coaches and teammates I&#x27;ve had the privilege of learning from and playing along side of, throughout my career. While I always dreamed of playing in the NHL, I can&#x27;t honestly say that I would have ever imagined that I&#x27;d be this fortunate and blessed. I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has helped me fulfill this dream.&quot;

In December 2009, Shanahan accepted an offer from the NHL to become the NHL&#x27;s vice president of hockey and business development. &quot;In a broad sense, I think obviously, I am going to be another voice in the hockey ops, but at the same time people like [NHL COO] John Collins and [NHL EVP Communications] Gary [Meagher] and [NHL Deputy Commissioner] Bill [Daly] are going to allow me and teach me the business of hockey,&quot; Shanahan told NHL.com. &quot;What I was excited about in their offer to bring me on board is that it was wide open for me. There was not going to be any room with a closed door and I would be given an opportunity to see and learn. As time goes by there will be some days where my role is more hockey specific and some days where my role is more business or marketing specific.&quot;

Shanahan spoke at the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and sought to bring the fun back into youth developing skills for the game. He felt that, &quot;Anytime you can get a kid out on the ice and just make it fun and he is developing and improving without knowing he&#x27;s developing and improving, and all he cares about is that he is having a great deal of fun out there, that&#x27;s when you have really locked onto something valuable&quot;.

On June 1, 2011, Shanahan succeeded Colin Campbell as the NHL&#x27;s senior vice president. When handing out rulings on plays that were sent to his office for review, Shanahan posted videos to the NHL&#x27;s official Website in which he explained how they either did or did not breach NHL rules. He narrated all videos except French-language videos involving the Montreal Canadiens or Ottawa Senators; these were narrated by a deputy, Stéphane Quintal. These videos were spoofed at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas, with Will Arnett portraying Shanahan.

In his first season as senior vice president, Shanahan delivered multiple suspensions to players for illegal hits.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===

On April 11, 2014, Shanahan was officially announced as the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; president and alternate governor. He was brought on to oversee all operations for the hockey club. On the same day, the NHL announced that Quintal would succeed him as the league&#x27;s chief disciplinarian.

Shanahan arrived to a Maple Leafs franchise which had qualified for the playoffs just once in the previous 10 years, and had just fallen out of a playoff spot in the late stages of the 2013–14 season. In the 2014–15 season, his first full season in charge, Shanahan made the decision to initiate a long-term, &quot;scorched-earth&quot; rebuild, which he started by firing head coach Randy Carlyle midway through the season despite being in contention for a playoff berth. The team only won only 9 of its 42 games under Carlyle&#x27;s interim replacement, Peter Horachek, and wound up in second last place in the Eastern Conference and 4th last place in the league. On April 12, 2015, a day after the team&#x27;s season ended, Shanahan fired Horachek and the rest of the coaching staff, in addition to GM Dave Nonis and several members of the team&#x27;s scouting staff.

On May 20, 2015, the Maple Leafs announced the hiring of the highly sought-after Mike Babcock, a Stanley Cup champion and two-time Olympic Gold medalist with Team Canada, as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Babcock agreed to a reported 8-year, $50 million contract, becoming the highest paid coach in the history of the NHL. On the ice, the Maple Leafs, led by Shanahan (along with acting GM&#x27;s Kyle Dubas and Mark Hunter) drafted Toronto-area native Mitch Marner 4th overall in the 2015 draft and traded forward Phil Kessel, the Maple Leafs&#x27; scoring leader for each of his six seasons on the team, to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a package which included a first-round pick and prospect Kasperi Kapanen. On July 24, 2015, the Maple Leafs hired longtime New Jersey Devils GM Lou Lamoriello to serve in the same capacity with the Maple Leafs.

Despite a new off-ice hierarchy led by Babcock and Lamoriello, both highly regarded around the league, the Maple Leafs playing squad remained lackluster and once again finished near the bottom of the standings, actually finishing dead last in the league. However, the season brought some optimism as prospects William Nylander, Kasperi Kapanen, Connor Brown, and Zach Hyman made their NHL debuts. Further optimism arrived at the end of the season, as the Maple Leafs won the top pick in the 2016 draft and drafted Auston Matthews with that pick. Team captain Dion Phaneuf was also traded to the Ottawa Senators mid-season and his position as captain would remain vacant for another three seasons.

Entering the 2016–17 season, expectations remained low for the Maple Leafs, who iced a youthful roster led by top prospects Matthews and Marner, as well as Nylander who became a full-time NHL regular during the season. However, the team wound up surprising many, unexpectedly making the playoffs, led by Matthews&#x27; 40-goal season, for which he was recognized with the Calder Trophy as the top rookie, as well as Marner and Nylander&#x27;s strong rookie seasons (61 points each). They lost to the heavily favoured Washington Capitals, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners, in a six-game first-round series. Over the next few years, the Maple Leafs established themselves as a contender in the NHL, behind the core of Matthews, Marner, Nylander and Morgan Rielly, making the playoffs in each of the following three seasons but failing to advance past the first round each time.

At the end of the 2017–18 season, Lamoriello left the organization for the New York Islanders and assistant GM Kyle Dubas, Shanahan&#x27;s first major hire back when he first arrived, was promoted to replace him. Another major acquisition occurred in free agency in 2018, as star centre John Tavares joined the Maple Leafs on a 7-year contract. Shanahan also approved Dubas&#x27; decision to fire Babcock in November 2019, amidst a poor start to the 2019–20 season, and the hiring of Sheldon Keefe to replace him.

Shanahan&#x27;s rebuild of the Maple Leafs has been nicknamed &quot;the Shanaplan&quot; among Maple Leafs fans and he has won praise for the method through which he rebuilt the team, by drafting and developing a young core as opposed to signing older players for a quick fix. However, he and Dubas have come under scrutiny for multiple 1st round postseason exits; the Leafs as a team had not advanced to the second round of the postseason since 2004 until their series win over the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2023.

==International play==
Shanahan has participated in seven international tournaments for Canada:

*1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (Disqualified)
*1991 Canada Cup (gold medal)
*1994 World Championships (gold medal)
*1996 World Cup of Hockey (silver medal)
*1998 Winter Olympics (4th place)
*2002 Winter Olympics (gold medal)
*2006 World Championships (Captain, 4th place)

==Personal life==
The son of Irish parents, Rosaleen and Donal (d. 1990), Shanahan also excelled in lacrosse. His father was a firefighter and later Chief of Fire Prevention in the city of Toronto. As a youth, he played in the 1982 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mississauga. He grew up in Etobicoke (now a part of Toronto), where he attended St. Leo&#x27;s Catholic School and his family attended St. Leo&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. Shanahan briefly attended Catholic Central High School in London, Ontario, where he graduated.

Shanahan has three brothers — Danny, Brian and Shaun. He also attended Michael Power/St. Joseph High School, where he played on the hockey team and won an Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (OFSAA) gold medal in 1985.

Shanahan married his wife Catherine on July 4, 1998, and the couple have three children. Shanahan became a United States citizen on May 17, 2002. Shanahan has also had small roles in a few films. He appeared in a generic role in &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; starring Canadian actor Jim Carrey.

<text>Howard Robard Hughes Sr. (September 9, 1869 – January 14, 1924) was an American businessman and inventor who founded the Hughes Tool Company. He invented the &quot;Sharp–Hughes&quot; two-cone rotary drill bit during the Texas Oil Boom. Hughes was the father and namesake of Howard Hughes (Howard Robard Hughes Jr.) the American business tycoon and founder of Hughes Aircraft.

==Early life and education==
Howard Robard Hughes Sr. was born on September 9, 1869, in Lancaster, Missouri, the son of Jean Amelia (née Summerlin; 1842–1928) and Judge Felix Turner Hughes (1837-1926). Hughes&#x27;s older sister Greta, better known by her stage name Jeanne Greta, was a grand opera and concert singer. His younger brother, Rupert Hughes, was a famed novelist and screenwriter. Another brother, Felix Jr., was a baritone opera singer. Hughes was a classic entrepreneur, trying and failing at many things before eventually finding success. 
After spending his childhood and early adulthood in Keokuk, Iowa; he lived in various places such as New York City, where he was a member of the Harvard Club; Denver; Joplin, Missouri; and Beaumont, Texas, prior to finally settling in Houston; where his son Howard Jr. was born.

Hughes Sr. was educated at Missouri Military Academy, in Mexico, Missouri. He then entered Harvard University in 1893, dropping out the next year.


==Career==

Hughes Sr. married Allene Stone Gano, on June 24, 1904, in Dallas County, Texas, and engaged in various mining business endeavors before capitalizing on the Spindletop oil discovery in Texas, as a result of which he began devoting his full time to the oil business. In 1906, Hughes began experiments of ways to replace the state of the art technology at that time, the fishtail bit. (See image) 

In 1908, he and Walter Benona Sharp, his business partner, built a two-cone drill bit model using wood. On November 20, 1908, he filed the basic patents for the Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit, and on August 10, 1909, was granted and for this rock drill. Hughes&#x27;s two-cone rotary drill bit, nicknamed &quot;rock eater&quot;, penetrated medium and hard rock with ten times the speed of any former bit, and its development revolutionized oil well drilling.

It is unlikely that he actually invented the two-cone roller bit, but his legal experience helped him in understanding that its patents were important for capitalizing on the invention. According to the PBS show &quot;History Detectives&quot;, several other people and companies had produced similar drill bits years earlier. In its initial tests at Goose Creek Oil Field in 1909 where the first offshore drilling for oil in Texas was occurring in Harris County, southeast of Houston on Galveston Bay, the Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit penetrated in 11 hours of hard rock which no previous equipment had been able to penetrate at all.

During WWI, he invented a tunnel boring machine for soldiers to create tunnels from their trenches.

He co-founded the Sharp-Hughes Tool Company with Walter Benona Sharp in 1909, and after Sharp&#x27;s death in 1912, took over management. Hughes began purchasing the Sharp stock immediately and by 1918 had acquired full ownership of the company. The essential assets of Hughes Tool Company, as it was renamed, were August 10, 1909, patents for his dual-cone rotary drill bit. The fees for licensing this technology were the basis of Hughes Tool&#x27;s revenues, and by 1914 the dual-cone roller bit was used in eleven U.S. states and in thirteen foreign countries. Hughes himself whimsically remarked that one of his &quot;fond plans&quot; was to &quot;drill the deepest well in the world&quot;, comparing his quest to the Earth&#x27;s center to Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition and Robert Peary&#x27;s North Pole expeditions.

== Awards and accolades ==
100 years after the Hughes drill bit had been patented, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) designated the technology a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark on August 10, 2009.

==Death and legacy==
On January 14, 1924, Hughes Sr. died of a heart attack caused by an embolism at his company&#x27;s offices on the fifth floor of the Humble Oil Building in Houston at the age of 54. After his death, his only child, Howard Jr., assumed control of the company as its 75% owner at the age of 19. In his will, Hughes Sr. had left the remaining 25% to his parents, Felix Sr. and Mimi, and his brother Felix Jr. A little more than a year after his father&#x27;s death, Hughes Jr. had himself declared an adult (the age of majority at the time being 21) and bought out his grandparents and uncle for full control of Hughes Tool Company. The next year in 1925, Hughes Jr. appointed Noah Dietrich as CEO of Hughes Tool while he himself left for California to pursue filmmaking and aviation.

In 1933, Hughes Tool engineers created a tri-cone rotary drill bit, and from 1934 to 1951 Hughes&#x27;s market share approached 100%. The Sharp-Hughes Rock Bit found virtually all the oil discovered during the initial years of rotary drilling, and Hughes Jr. became one of the wealthiest people in the world from its revenues. Returning to play a more central role in Hughes Tool in the 1940s, Hughes Jr. diversified the company&#x27;s holdings by expanding into filmmaking, aviation, and the casino industry in Las Vegas, although his father&#x27;s core tool manufacturing business remained by far the company&#x27;s chief source of revenue. In 1972, by which time Hughes Tool had become widely diversified, Hughes Jr. sold the nucleus tool division and realized $150 million from the sale. In 1987, Hughes Tool merged with Baker International to form Baker Hughes, a large oilfield services company still based in Houston.

<text>David Sjodahl King (June 20, 1917 – May 5, 2009) was a representative from Utah. He served three terms between 1959 and 1967.

He was a member of the Democratic Party.

== Early life and education ==
King was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1917. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1937. From 1937 to 1939, he served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Great Britain. After his mission, King attended and graduated from Georgetown University Law School. After serving as a clerk for Justice Howard M. Stephens of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1943, King returned to Utah.

== Legal and political career ==
King served as counsel to the Utah Tax Commission from 1944 to 1946. He also was involved in private practice from 1945. From 1946 to 1958, he taught commercial law at Intermountain Business College. From 1948 to 1958, King was the second assistant to Elbert R. Curtis, who was the ninth General Superintendent of the LDS Church&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association.

King was elected as a Democrat to the 86th and 87th United States Congresses between January 3, 1959 and January 3, 1963. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1962, choosing instead to run for a seat in the United States Senate. His senatorial campaign was unsuccessful. King was elected to the 89th Congress in 1964, but was defeated in his bid for reelection in 1966. He was appointed United States Ambassador to Madagascar and to Mauritius in January 1967 and in May 1968, respectively, serving in those two positions concurrently until August 1969.

During the 1970s and 1980s, King practiced law in Washington, D.C., and served as an alternate director at the World Bank. He retired in 1986 to devote his time to serving the LDS Church.

== LDS Church service ==
From July 1986 to June 1989, he served as president of the church&#x27;s Haiti Port-au-Prince Mission. From September 1990 to 1993 he was president of the Washington D.C. Temple in Kensington, Maryland. In 1994, he was called as patriarch of the Washington D.C. Stake and the church&#x27;s district for the District of Columbia.

== Family life ==
King was a resident of Kensington, Maryland where he lived with his wife of 61 years, Rosalie King. They were the parents of eight children, including Josephine &quot;Jody&quot; Olsen who became Director of the Peace Corps in 2018. His father, William H. King, was a Senator from Utah. He was preceded in death by his sons David King, Jr., and Elliott West King. David King died on May 5, 2009.

<text>Tax brackets are the divisions at which tax rates change in a progressive tax system (or an explicitly regressive tax system, though that is rarer). Essentially, tax brackets are the cutoff values for taxable income—income past a certain point is taxed at a higher rate.

==Example==
Imagine that there are three tax brackets: 10%, 20%, and 30%. The 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000; the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000; and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000.

Under this system, someone earning $10,000 is taxed at 10%, paying a total of $1,000. Someone earning $5,000 pays $500, and so on.

Meanwhile, someone who earns $25,000 faces a more complicated calculation. The rate on the first $10,000 is 10%, from $10,001 to $20,000 is 20%, and above that is 30%. Thus, they pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%), $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%), and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%), In total, they pay $4,500, or an 18% average tax rate.

In practice the computation is simplified by using point–slope form or slope–intercept form of the linear equation for the tax on a specific bracket, either as tax on the bottom amount of the bracket &quot;plus&quot; the tax on the marginal amount &quot;within&quot; the bracket:
:formula_1
or the tax on the entire amount (&quot;at&quot; the marginal rate), &quot;minus&quot; the amount that this overstates tax on the bottom end of the bracket.
:formula_2
See Progressive tax#Computation for details.

==Tax brackets in Canada==
Canada&#x27;s federal government has the following tax brackets for the 2012 tax year (all in Canadian dollars). The &quot;basic personal amount&quot; of $15,527 effectively means that income up to this amount is not subject to tax, although it is included in the calculation of taxable income.

Each province except Québec adds their own tax on top of the federal tax. Québec has a completely separate income tax.

==Tax brackets in Switzerland==

Personal income tax is progressive in nature. The total rate does not usually exceed 40%.

The Swiss Federal Tax Administration website provides a broad outline of the Swiss tax system, and full details and tax tables are available in PDF documents.

The complexity of the system is partly because the Confederation, the 26 Cantons that make up the federation,
and about 2 900 communes [municipalities] levy their own taxes based on the Federal Constitution and 
26 Cantonal Constitutions.

===2018 tax brackets===
As of 1 January 2018, the tax brackets have been updated due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:

In the United States, the dollar amounts of the federal income tax standard deduction and personal exemptions for the taxpayer and dependents are adjusted annually to account for inflation. This results in yearly changes to the personal income tax brackets even when the federal income tax rates remain unchanged.

===2011 tax brackets===
Two higher tax brackets (36% and 39.6%) were added in 1993, and then taxes in all brackets were lowered in 2001 through 2003 as follows:


===Internal Revenue Code terminology===

Gross salary is the amount your employer pays an employee, plus one&#x27;s income tax liability. Although the tax itself is included in this figure, it is typically the one used when discussing one&#x27;s pay. For example, John gets paid $50/hour as an administrative director. His annual gross salary is $50/hour x 2,000 hours/year = $100,000/year. Of this, some is paid to John, and the rest to taxes.

W-2 wages are the wages that appear on the employee&#x27;s W-2 issued by his employer each year in January. A copy of the W-2 is sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is the gross salary less any contributions to pre-tax plans. The W-2 form also shows the amount withheld by the employer for federal income tax.

W-2 wages = gross salary less (contributions to employer retirement plan)
less (contributions to employer health plan)
less (contributions to some other employer plans)

Total income is the sum of all taxable income, including the W-2 wages. Almost all income is taxable. There are a few exemptions for individuals such as non-taxable interest on government bonds, a portion of the Social Security (SS) income (not the payments to SS, but the payments from SS to the individual), etc.

Adjusted gross income (AGI) is Total Income less some specific allowed deductions. Such as; alimony paid (income to the recipient), permitted moving expenses, self-employed retirement program, student loan interest, etc.

Itemized deductions are other specific deductions such as; mortgage interest on a home, state income taxes or sales taxes, local property taxes, charitable contributions, state income tax withheld, etc.

Standard deduction is a sort of minimum itemized deduction. If all itemized deductions are added up and it is less than the standard deduction, the standard deduction is taken. In 2007 this was $5,350 for those filing individually and $10,700 for married filing jointly.

Personal exemption is a tax exemption in which the taxpayer may deduct an amount from their gross income for each dependent they claim. It was $3,400 in 2007.

===Sample tax calculation===
Given the complexity of the United States&#x27; income tax code, individuals often find it necessary to consult a tax accountant or professional tax preparer. For example, John, a married 44-year-old who has two children, earned a gross salary of $100,000 in 2007. He contributes the maximum $15,500 per year to his employer&#x27;s 401(k) retirement plan, pays $1,800 per year for his employer&#x27;s family health plan, and $500 per year to his employer&#x27;s Flexfund medical expense plan. All of the plans are allowed pre-tax contributions.

Gross pay = $100,000

W-2 wages = $100,000 – $15,500 – $1,800 – $500 = $82,200

John&#x27;s and his wife&#x27;s other income is $12,000 from John&#x27;s wife&#x27;s wages (she also got a W-2 but had no pre-tax contributions), $200 interest from a bank account, and a $150 state tax refund.

Total Income = $82,200 + $12,000 + $200 + $150 = $94,550.

John&#x27;s employer reassigned John to a new office and his moving expenses were $8,000, of which $2,000 was not reimbursed by his employer.

Adjusted gross income = $94,550 – $2,000 = $92,550.

John&#x27;s itemized deductions were $22,300 (mortgage interest, property taxes, and state income tax withheld).

John had four personal exemptions—himself, his wife and two children. His total personal exemptions were 4 x $3,400 = $13,600.

Taxable Income = $92,550 – $22,300 – $13,600 = $56,650.

The tax on the Taxable Income is found in a Tax Table if the Taxable Income is less than $100,000 and is computed if over $100,000. Both are used. The Tax Tables are in the 2007 1040 Instructions. The Tax Tables list income in $50 increments for all categories of taxpayers, single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, and head of household. For the Taxable Income range of &quot;at least $56,650 but less than $56,700&quot; the tax is $7,718 for a taxpayer who is married filing jointly.

The 2007 tax rates schedule for married filing jointly is:

The tax is 10% on the first $15,650 = $1,565.00

plus 15% of the amount over $15,650 ($56,650 – $15,650) = $41,000 x 15% = $6,150.00

Total ($1,565.00 + $6,150.00) = $7,715.00

In addition to the Federal income tax, John probably pays state income tax, Social Security tax, and Medicare tax. The Social Security tax in 2007 for John is 6.2% on the first $97,500 of earned income (wages), or a maximum of $6,045. There are no exclusions from earned income for Social Security so John pays the maximum of $6,045. His wife pays $12,000 x 6.2% = $744. Medicare is 1.45% on all earned income with no maximum. John and his wife pays $112,000 x 1.45% = $1,624 for Medicare in 2007.

Most states also levy income tax, exceptions being Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming.

<text>Hans Jürgen &quot;Hansi&quot; Kürsch (born 10 August 1966) is a German singer, best known as a member of the power metal band Blind Guardian. One of the founders of the band, he has been its lead vocalist since its creation in 1984, and also acted as the band&#x27;s bass guitarist until 1996.

He is also the former lead vocalist of Demons &amp; Wizards, a side-project with Iced Earth guitarist Jon Schaffer until his departure from the project in 2021. Additionally, he has worked prominently as a guest with other artists, including Angra, Edguy, Iced Earth, and Therion; he notably played characters in the Ayreon albums &quot;01011001&quot; and &quot;The Source&quot;.

==Early life==
Kürsch was born on 10 August 1966 in Lank-Latum, near Düsseldorf, to a working-class family in West Germany. He is the youngest of four siblings.

Kürsch was raised in the suburb of Lank-Latum, near a castle called Burg Linn. Having spent his childhood playing football near the castle nurtured his love and passion both for football, as well as fantasy and fairytales, which later became the main source for his lyrics. 

By the time he was ten, Kürsch discovered his love for music, specifically Classic Rock bands, such as the Electric Light Orchestra, Genesis or Queen. However, the turning point for him was coming across Deep Purple’s 24 Carat Purple for the first time, which not only started his love for Hard Rock music, but also introduced him to bands like The Who, Led Zeppelin, and others. He lists Ian Gillan, Freddie Mercury, and Peter Gabriel as his favorite singers, and the ones who influenced him the most.

==Personal life==
In 1984, while being a Commerce School student, and on the same day Kürsch met his current bandmate and Blind Guardian cofounder, André Olbrich, he became aware of a female student called Andrea, whom he later married in 1991. Their son, Jonas, was born in 2001. Kürsch still resides in Krefeld together with his wife and son.

==History==
A signature of Kürsch&#x27;s songwriting is his practice of overdubbing his own voice multiple times in complex, overlapping harmonies on his recordings, creating the atmosphere of a huge choir. The track &quot;Chant&quot; on the first Demons &amp; Wizards album is vocal only, in the style of a traditional Gregorian chant; Kürsch&#x27;s is the only voice on the song.

Kürsch&#x27;s lyrics revolve around various themes prevalent in the power metal genre, including medieval fantasy, J. R. R. Tolkien, religious/mythological tales, and legends/stories, both his own and from the literary world. His lyrics in the first Demons &amp; Wizards album tackle even various themes, whereas &quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot; was based primarily off different fantasy novels.
Kürsch had also recorded three albums for his side project with Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth, Demons &amp; Wizards until his departure in 2021.

*Demons &amp; Wizards – &quot;Demons &amp; Wizards&quot; (2000)
*Demons &amp; Wizards – &quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot; (2005)
*Demons &amp; Wizards – &quot;III&quot; (2020)

Although mostly known for being a clean singer nowadays, Kürsch&#x27;s early technique made use of a harsher, &quot;screaming&quot; technique. He can be heard using similar, more aggressive, technique while singing guest vocals for Heaven Shall Burn&#x27;s cover of &quot;Valhalla&quot;.

<doc id="768133" wikidata="Q1186703" url="?curid=768133" title="Demyelinating disease">
<text>A demyelinating disease refers to any disease affecting the nervous system where the myelin sheath surrounding neurons is damaged. This damage disrupts the transmission of signals through the affected nerves, resulting in a decrease in their conduction ability. Consequently, this reduction in conduction can lead to deficiencies in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on the nerves affected.

Various factors can contribute to the development of demyelinating diseases, including genetic predisposition, infectious agents, autoimmune reactions, and other unknown factors. Proposed causes of demyelination include genetic predisposition, environmental factors such as viral infections or exposure to certain chemicals. Additionally, exposure to commercial insecticides like sheep dip, weed killers, and flea treatment preparations for pets, which contain organophosphates, can also lead to nerve demyelination. Chronic exposure to neuroleptic medications may also cause demyelination. Furthermore, deficiencies in vitamin B12 can result in dysmyelination.

Demyelinating diseases are traditionally classified into two types: demyelinating myelinoclastic diseases and demyelinating leukodystrophic diseases. In the first group, a healthy and normal myelin is destroyed by toxic substances, chemicals, or autoimmune reactions. In the second group, the myelin is inherently abnormal and undergoes degeneration. The Poser criteria named this second group dysmyelinating diseases.

In the most well-known demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, evidence suggests that the body&#x27;s immune system plays a significant role. Acquired immune system cells, specifically T-cells, are found at the site of lesions. Other immune system cells, such as macrophages (and possibly mast cells), also contribute to the damage.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms and signs that present in demyelinating diseases are different for each condition. These symptoms and signs can present in a person with a demyelinating disease:
* Blurred double vision (Diplopia)
* Ataxia
* Clonus
* Dysarthria
* Fatigue
* Clumsiness
* Hand paralysis
* Hemiparesis
* Genital anaesthesia
* Incoordination
* Paresthesias
* Ocular paralysis (cranial nerve palsy)
* Impaired muscle coordination
* Weakness (muscle)
* Loss of sensation
* Impaired vision
* Unsteady gait
* Spastic paraparesis
* Incontinence
* Hearing problems
* Speech problems
== Evolutionary considerations ==
The role of prolonged cortical myelination in human evolution has been implicated as a contributing factor in some cases of demyelinating disease. Unlike other primates, humans exhibit a unique pattern of postpubertal myelination, which may contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases that present in early adulthood and beyond. The extended period of cortical myelination in humans may allow greater opportunities for disruption in myelination, resulting in the onset of demyelinating disease. Furthermore, humans have significantly greater prefrontal white matter volume than other primate species, which implies greater myelin density. Increased myelin density in humans as a result of a prolonged myelination may, therefore, structure risk for myelin degeneration and dysfunction. Evolutionary considerations for the role of prolonged cortical myelination as a risk factor for demyelinating disease are particularly pertinent given that genetics and autoimmune deficiency hypotheses fail to explain many cases of demyelinating disease. As has been argued, diseases such as multiple sclerosis cannot be accounted for by autoimmune deficiency alone, but strongly imply the influence of flawed developmental processes in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, the role of the human-specific prolonged period of cortical myelination is an important evolutionary consideration in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease.

== Diagnosis ==
Various methods/techniques are used to diagnose demyelinating diseases:
* Exclusion of other conditions that have overlapping symptoms
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to visualize internal structures of the body in detail. MRI makes use of the property of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to image nuclei of atoms inside the body. This method is reliable because MRIs assess changes in proton density. &quot;Spots&quot; can occur as a result of changes in brain water content.
* Evoked potential is an electrical potential recorded from the nervous system following the presentation of a stimulus as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiological recording method.
* Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) can be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of central nervous system infections. A CSF culture examination may yield the microorganism that caused the infection.
* Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive analytical technique that has been used to study metabolic changes in brain tumors, strokes, seizure disorders, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, depression, and other diseases affecting the brain. It has also been used to study the metabolism of other organs such as muscles.
* Diagnostic criteria refers to a specific combination of signs, symptoms, and test results that the clinician uses in an attempt to determine the correct diagnosis.
* Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) uses a pulse sequence to suppress cerebrospinal fluid and show lesions more clearly, and is used for example in multiple sclerosis evaluation.

=== Types ===
Demyelinating diseases can be divided in those affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and those affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). They can also be classified by the presence or absence of inflammation. Finally, a division may be made based on the underlying cause of demyelination: the disease process can be demyelinating myelinoclastic, wherein myelin is destroyed; or dysmyelinating leukodystrophic, wherein myelin is abnormal and degenerative.

====CNS====
The demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system include:
* Myelinoclastic or demyelinating disorders:
** Typical forms of multiple sclerosis
** Neuromyelitis optica, or Devic&#x27;s disease
** Idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases
* Leukodystrophic or dysmyelinating disorders:
** CNS neuropathies such as those produced by vitamin B12 deficiency
** Central pontine myelinolysis
** Myelopathies such as tabes dorsalis (syphilitic myelopathy)
** Leukoencephalopathies such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
** Leukodystrophies

The myelinoclastic disorders are typically associated with symptoms such as optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, because the demyelinating inflammation can affect the optic nerve or spinal cord. Many are idiopathic. Both myelinoclastic and leukodystrophic modes of disease may result in lesional demyelinations of the central nervous system.

====PNS====

The demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system include:
* Guillain–Barré syndrome and its chronic counterpart, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
* Anti-MAG peripheral neuropathy
* Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and its counterpart Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
* Copper deficiency-associated conditions (peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, and rarely optic neuropathy)
* Progressive inflammatory neuropathy

== Treatment ==
Treatments are patient-specific and depend on the symptoms that present with the disorder, as well as the progression of the condition. Improvements to the patient&#x27;s life may be accomplished through the management of symptoms or slowing of the rate of demyelination. Treatment can include medication, lifestyle changes (i.e. smoking cessation, increased rest, and dietary changes), counselling, relaxation, physical exercise, patient education, and in some cases, deep brain thalamic stimulation (to ameliorate tremors).

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis depends on the condition itself. Some conditions such as MS depend on the subtype of the disease and various attributes of the patient such as age, sex, initial symptoms, and the degree of disability the patient experiences. Life expectancy in MS patients is 5 to 10 years lower than unaffected people. MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that develops in genetically susceptible individuals after exposure to unknown environmental trigger(s). The bases for MS are unknown but are strongly suspected to involve immune reactions against autoantigens, particularly myelin proteins. The most accepted hypothesis is that dialogue between T-cell receptors and myelin antigens leads to an immune attack on the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex. These interactions between active T cells and myelin antigens provoke a massive destructive inflammatory response and promote continuing proliferation of T and B cells and macrophage activation, which sustains secretion of inflammatory mediators. Other conditions such as central pontine myelinolysis have about a third of patients recover and the other two-thirds experience varying degrees of disability. In some cases, such as transverse myelitis, the patient can begin recovery as early as 2 to 12 weeks after the onset of the condition.

== Epidemiology ==
Incidence of demyelinating diseases varies by disorder. Some conditions, such as tabes dorsalis appear predominantly in males and begin in midlife. Optic neuritis, though, occurs preferentially in females typically between the ages of 30 and 35. Other conditions such as multiple sclerosis vary in prevalence depending on the country and population. This condition can appear in children and adults.

== Research ==
Much of the research conducted on demyelinating diseases is targeted towards discovering the mechanisms by which these disorders function in an attempt to develop therapies and treatments for individuals affected by these conditions. For example, proteomics has revealed several proteins which contribute to the pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases.
For example, COX-2 has been implicated in oligodendrocyte death in animal models of demyelination.
The presence of myelin debris has been correlated with damaging inflammation as well as poor regeneration, due to the presence of inhibitory myelin components.

N-cadherin is expressed in regions of active remyelination and may play an important role in generating a local environment conducive to remyelination. N-cadherin agonists have been identified and observed to stimulate neurite growth and cell migration, key aspects of promoting axon growth and remyelination after injury or disease.

Immunomodulatory drugs such as fingolimod have been shown to reduce immune-mediated damage to the CNS, preventing further damage in patients with MS. The drug targets the role of macrophages in disease progression.

Manipulating thyroid hormone levels may become a viable strategy to promote remyelination and prevent irreversible damage in MS patients.
It has also been shown that intranasal administration of apotransferrin (aTf) can protect myelin and induce remyelination.
Finally, electrical stimulation which activates neural stem cells may provide a method by which regions of demyelination can be repaired.

== In other animals ==
Demyelinating diseases/disorders have been found worldwide in various animals. Some of these animals include mice, pigs, cattle, hamsters, rats, sheep, Siamese kittens, and a number of dog breeds (including Chow Chow, Springer Spaniel, Dalmatian, Samoyed, Golden Retriever, Lurcher, Bernese Mountain Dog, Vizsla, Weimaraner, Australian Silky Terrier, and mixed breeds).

<doc id="768139" wikidata="Q456005" url="?curid=768139" title="Jon Schaffer">
<text>Jon Ryan Schaffer ( ; born March 15, 1968) is an American heavy metal musician. He is the rhythm guitarist, bandleader and principal songwriter of the Indiana-based heavy metal band Iced Earth, which he formed in 1985 under the name Purgatory. He is also the lead singer in his political side project Sons of Liberty and, until 2021, played guitar for Demons &amp; Wizards, his collaboration with Blind Guardian frontman Hansi Kürsch. In a 2019 poll by &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Schaffer was ranked as the 25th-best rhythm guitar player of all time.

Schaffer is a founding lifetime member of the far-right Oath Keepers militia. He pleaded guilty to crimes related to his participation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack in 2021 and was sentenced to three years probation.

==Early life==
Schaffer was originally introduced to rock music at the age of three. His older sister introduced Jon to bands such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, and Blue Öyster Cult. In 1979, at the age of eleven, Schaffer attended a Kiss concert with his father. Since then, he has said that this was the moment when he realized what he wanted to do for a living.

Schaffer went to a Lutheran school for five years, during which he developed a lot of anger and rebellion, due to the abusive nature of the pastors. Allegedly, on one occasion, one of the pastors &quot;shoved a bar of soap down Schaffer&#x27;s throat&quot;, because the pastor felt threatened by his refusal to submit, after he could not answer Schaffer&#x27;s questions about evolution versus creationism. According to Schaffer, this had an effect on him forming a band, so that he could &quot;prove these people wrong&quot;.

In 1984, at the age of 16, Schaffer moved to Tampa, Florida. Shortly before he left, one of Schaffer&#x27;s childhood friends died in a motorcycle accident, which made Schaffer even more determined to move to Florida and start a band. While in Tampa, Schaffer slept in his car. Later he nearly lost his life in a car accident, after which he got an apartment and a job as a roofer.

==Career==

===Iced Earth===

In 1984, Schaffer formed a short-lived band called &quot;the Rose&quot;. The band quickly broke up, after which Jon formed what would later become Iced Earth under the name &quot;Purgatory&quot; on January 20, 1985. Schaffer played rhythm guitar and also designed the band&#x27;s logo. The logo had originally been used for the Rose, but after the band broke up, Schaffer reused the logo for Purgatory and later for Iced Earth.

In 1990, after some line-up changes, the band, now known as Iced Earth, released their self-titled debut album. In addition to playing rhythm guitar and singing backing vocals, Jon also acted as co-producer on the album, as he has done on all Iced Earth albums since. The following year, the band released the follow-up album, &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot;, which also featured Jon singing lead vocals on the song &quot;Stormrider&quot;.
After some downtime between 1992 and 1995, Iced Earth re-emerged with a new line up, which included singer Matt Barlow, who would stay with the band until 2003. The band released the albums &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; and &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; in 1995 and 1996 respectively, until in 1998, Iced Earth released the album &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, which featured three songs (&quot;Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Birth of the Wicked&quot; and &quot;The Coming Curse&quot;) that were based on Jon Schaffer&#x27;s Something Wicked concept. The songs tell the story of a character that Jon created, called Set Abominae, who also appears on the album&#x27;s front cover.

After &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, Iced Earth released the album &quot;Horror Show&quot; in 2001, after which work began on the follow-up album, &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;. Originally Matt Barlow had recorded the vocal tracks for the album, but due to his lack of interest in the band following the events of 9/11, he left the group in 2003 and joined the Georgetown Police Department in Georgetown, Delaware. Matt was replaced by former Judas Priest-singer Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, who resung the entire album. &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot; was released in January 2004, after which Jon started work on two concept albums based on his Something Wicked storyline. The first album, &quot;Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1&quot; was released on September 11, 2007, after which, in December 2007, it was announced that Matt Barlow would be returning to Iced Earth. The second album, &quot;The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2&quot;, was released September 5, 2008, and featured Matt once again on vocals.

In 2011, after about two years back in the band, Matt Barlow issued a statement saying that he was leaving Iced Earth in order to spend more time with his family. Matt Barlow was later replaced by Stu Block from Into Eternity, who had opened for Iced Earth in 2008. With Block, the band recorded the album &quot;Dystopia&quot;, which was released on October 17, 2011. From October 2011, to December 2012, Iced Earth toured in support of &quot;Dystopia&quot;, during which time they recorded the album &quot;Live in Ancient Kourion&quot;.

===Demons &amp; Wizards===

Demons &amp; Wizards was a side project Schaffer put together with Blind Guardian frontman Hansi Kürsch. Schaffer and Hansi had originally met in the early 1990s, when Iced Earth and Blind Guardian toured together. Demons &amp; Wizards released their self-titled debut album in 2000. Besides Jon and Hansi, the album also featured Mark Prator on drums and Jim Morris on lead guitar. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot; was released in 2005, and featured a number of guest musicians, including Bobby Jarzombek, Jim Morris, Rubin Drake, Howard Helm, Kathy Helm, Tori Fuson, Jesse Morris and Krystyna Kolaczynski.
In a video update in 2011, Schaffer and Kürsch talked about the future of Demons &amp; Wizards and stated, that it was only a matter of their schedules lining up when they are going to start work on a third album. III was subsequently released in 2020.

In 2021, following Schaffer&#x27;s involvement in the storming of the U.S. Capitol, Kürsch announced he was leaving the band.

===Sons of Liberty===
Sons of Liberty is a political side project Schaffer formed in 2009. Sons of Liberty&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Brush-fires of the Mind&quot;, was released in December 2009 as a free download on the band&#x27;s website (the album was later made available on CD and vinyl as well). Schaffer sang, played guitar and programmed the drums, but the album also featured a number of guests, including Jim Morris, Ruben Drake, Troy Seele, Howard Helm and Jeff Brandt. During the supporting tour, Jon Schaffer was backed up by Seele, Freddie Vidales and Brent Smedley.

In December 2011, Sons of Liberty released the EP &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;. Once again, the album featured Schaffer singing, playing guitar and programming the drums, as well as Jim Morris and Ruben Drake.

===Other work===
Schaffer used to own a store called the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;. He also participated in the film &quot;Silver Circle&quot;. In 2012, Schaffer was featured as a guest vocalist on Anarchadia&#x27;s album &quot;Let Us All Unite&quot;, performing on the track &quot;True World Order&quot;. Schaffer has also expressed interest in doing comic book series based on the &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; album and the Something Wicked Saga.

== Participation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack ==

On January 6, 2021, Schaffer, a founding lifetime member of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, was photographed among those who stormed the U.S. Capitol building. After appearing on the Most Wanted section of the FBI&#x27;s website, he turned himself in on January 17 and was held on six felony charges. At a November 2020 Washington, D.C. Trump rally, Schaffer told German daily newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;,

&quot;My name is Jon Schaffer. I&#x27;m from Indiana. A group of thugs and criminals hijacked this country a long time ago. Now they&#x27;re making their big move, and it&#x27;s not gonna happen. And that&#x27;s what it is. These are globalists. These are the scum of the earth. These are the criminals that are behind all the fraudulent fee on currency, they&#x27;re behind all the wars, they&#x27;re behind all the shit, they&#x27;re behind divide-and-conquer tactics, behind the racial divide. It&#x27;s all nonsense, it&#x27;s all garbage. People need to wake up and snap out of the matrix, because they&#x27;re going down. They&#x27;ve made the move. They&#x27;re messing with the wrong people here — trust me on that. And we needed it to be open like this — open fraud, open theft. Because now we see you, and you&#x27;re going down. Mark my words&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I think this goes beyond President Trump,&quot; Jon continued. &quot;President Trump is a populist. He&#x27;s not your typical Republican. He&#x27;s not establishment. He&#x27;s not going out starting wars all over the place, like they do. Which is funny — where are all the Democrats that were anti-war?&quot;

On April 16, 2021, Schaffer agreed to plead guilty to two charges: obstructing an official proceeding of Congress and trespassing on restricted grounds of the Capitol while armed with a dangerous weapon. He was the first participant in the storming to plead guilty. Prosecutors agreed to a recommendation of between 3.5 and 4.5 years in prison, depending on his cooperation in prosecuting other rioters. He would also be granted sponsorship for the United States Federal Witness Protection Program.

According to Schaffer&#x27;s attorney, while Schaffer was held at an Indiana jail, other inmates made death threats against him, and threw feces at him. He was subsequently transferred to a jail in Washington, D.C. In October 2024, Schaffer was sentenced to three years of probation, 120 hours of community service and $1,200 in restitution and fines. Schaffer issued a statement saying &quot;I profoundly regret my actions on January 6th, 2021&quot;, adding &quot;I’m not excusing my impulsive behavior. I was wrong, and I take ownership of my actions. I own the fact that I made a huge mistake, and I wish I never would have gone there. In fact, the consequences have been devastating of my life, family, friends, business, colleagues and business partners.&quot;

On January 20, 2025, the day President Donald Trump took office for his second term, Schaffer, among many others was given a Presidential Pardon.

==Personal life==
In 1996, while performing in Berlin, Schaffer injured his neck, for which he had surgery in 2000. In the early 2000s, he had surgery again, this time for lower-back problems. In 2005, Schaffer&#x27;s daughter was born, whom he credits for giving him &quot;perspective&quot;, that he &quot;never had before&quot;.

Besides playing music, Schaffer enjoys studying history and current events, as well as &quot;standing against, and exposing, tyranny&quot;. He also enjoys riding motorcycles, scuba diving, white water rafting and exercising. Schaffer has listed Tom Schaffer, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, Stephen Toboz, Steve Harris, Ronnie James Dio, Hansi Kürsch, Aaron Russo, G. Edward Griffin and Ron Paul as people who inspire him.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;InfoWars&quot; founder Alex Jones discussing their mutual political views, Schaffer revealed that &quot;My father was a John Birch guy. When I was a young child I remember things that he and his friends would talk about, concerning the UN and stuff&quot;.

<doc id="768141" wikidata="Q230184" url="?curid=768141" title="Lee Grant">
<text>Lee Grant (born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal; October 31, during the mid-1920s) is an American actress, documentarian, and director. In a career spanning over seven decades, she won an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Directors Guild of America Award, in addition to nominations for five Golden Globe Awards. She is one of the last surviving actors of the Hollywood blacklist era.

Grant began her career on Broadway, making her debut in &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1949) as the Shoplifter. She reprised the role in the film adaptation (1951), earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and winning the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. Her career was interrupted when she was blacklisted for 12 years after refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. During this period, she worked as an acting teacher and took minor television and theater roles under pseudonyms.

Grant returned to prominence with her role in the television series &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1965-1966), winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama Series. She appeared in supporting roles in &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1970), receiving Academy Award nominations for the latter, as well as &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975) and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), winning for &quot;Shampoo&quot;.

Grant transitioned to directing in the 1980s, focusing on documentaries and television films. She won the Directors Guild of America Award for &quot;Nobody’s Child&quot; (1986) while her film &quot;Down and Out in America&quot; (1986) tied for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, making her the only Academy Award-winning actor to direct an Academy Award-winning documentary. She continued directing into the 2000s while occasionally making acting appearances.

==Early life==
Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal in Manhattan, the only child of Witia (née Haskell), a child care worker, and Abraham W. Rosenthal, a realtor and educator. Her father was born in New York City, to Polish Jewish immigrants, and her mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant who, along with her sister Fremo, left Odessa to escape the pogroms. The family resided at 148th Street and Riverside in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.

Her birthday is October 31, but the year is disputed, with all years ranging from 1925 to 1931 having been given as her year of birth at some point; however, census data, travel manifests, and testimony suggest that she was born in 1925 or 1926, while Grant&#x27;s stated ages at the time of her professional debut and Oscar nomination indicate she was born in 1927.

Grant made her stage debut in &quot;L&#x27;Oracolo&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in 1931 and later joined the American Ballet as an adolescent. She attended Art Students League of New York, Juilliard School of Music, The High School of Music &amp; Art, and George Washington High School, all in New York City. Grant graduated from high school and won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where she studied under Sanford Meisner. Grant undertook further study with Uta Hagen at the HB Studio. She later enrolled in the Actors Studio in New York.

==Career==
===1930s–1950s===
Grant had her first stage ballet performance in 1933 at the Metropolitan Opera House. In 1938, in her early teens, she was made a member of the American Ballet under George Balanchine. As an actress, Grant had her professional stage debut as understudy in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1944. In 1948, she had her Broadway acting debut in &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. Grant established herself as a dramatic method actress on and off Broadway, earning praise for her first major role as a shoplifter in &quot;Detective Story&quot; in 1949.

She made her film debut two years later in the 1951 film version (&quot;Detective Story&quot;), starring Kirk Douglas, receiving her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination, and winning the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. She said she enjoyed working under director William Wyler, who helped guide her.

In 1951, she gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for actor J. Edward Bromberg, whose early death, she implied, was caused by the stress of being called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Her name soon after appeared in the publication &quot;Red Channels&quot;, and as a result, for the next twelve years, her &quot;prime years&quot; as she put it, she was blacklisted and her work in television and movies was limited.

Kirk Douglas, who acted with her in &quot;Detective Story&quot;, recalled that director Edward Dmytryk, a blacklistee, had first named her husband at the HUAC:

Grant appeared in a number of plays, two feature films, and in a few small television roles during her blacklisted years. In 1953, she played Rose Peabody in the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, had featured supporting roles in the film dramas &quot;Storm Fear&quot; in 1955, and &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; in 1959. On stage, Grant starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Two for the Seesaw.&quot; In 1959, she succeeded Anne Bancroft in the lead female role. That same year, she had a supporting role in the romantic drama &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;.

===1960s===

By the time Grant&#x27;s name was removed from the blacklist in the mid-1960s, she was the divorced mother of a daughter, Dinah. Grant began re-establishing her television and movie career. In her autobiography, she writes: Her experience with the blacklist scarred her to such an extent that as late as 2002, she would freeze and go into a &quot;near trance&quot; when anyone asked her about her experiences during the McCarthy period.

Grant&#x27;s first major achievement, after HUAC officially cleared her, was in the 1960s television series &quot;Peyton Place&quot; as Stella Chernak, for which she won an Emmy in 1966. In 1963, she won acclaim for her stage performance in the off-Broadway production of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot;. In 1967, she played the distraught widow of a murder victim in the Oscar-winning &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. In 1968, Grant appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot;, portraying the wife of a U.S. diplomat who goes undercover to discredit a rogue diplomat. In 1969, she had supporting roles in the crime drama &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; and science fiction drama &quot;Marooned&quot;, but they were not successful.

===1970s===
Grant received three Academy Award nominations in the 1970s for &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1970), &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976). In &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), a successful comedy directed by Arthur Hiller and written by Neil Simon; she played the harried mother of a bride, with Walter Matthau as the father.

In March 1971, Grant played the murderer in the &quot;Columbo&quot; pilot episode &quot;Ransom for a Dead Man&quot;, playing opposite Peter Falk&#x27;s Lieutenant Columbo. For that role, she was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie. That same year, she also received a second Emmy nomination in the same category of Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the television film &quot;The Neon Ceiling&quot;, which she won.

Grant reunited with Peter Falk on Broadway in the original production of &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;, written by Neil Simon; the playwright said that his &quot;first and only choice&quot; for the part was Grant, who he said was equally at home with dramatists such as Chekhov or Sidney Kingsley, yet could also be &quot;hilariously funny&quot; when the script called for it, for she was able to portray essential honesty in her acting.

Grant won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress playing Warren Beatty&#x27;s older lover in &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975). The film was Columbia&#x27;s biggest hit in the studio&#x27;s 50-year history. &quot;Shampoo&quot; was the second film in which Grant acted under director Hal Ashby. Critic Pauline Kael, comparing her in both films, noted Grant &quot;is such a cool-style comedienne that she&#x27;s in danger of having people say that she&#x27;s good, as usual.&quot; During the filming, however, she did have some serious disagreements with Beatty, who was also the producer, and nearly quit. During one scene, she wanted to play it in a way she felt was more realistic from a woman&#x27;s perspective, but Beatty disagreed. After thinking about the scene for a few days, she told director Ashby that she could not do it Beatty&#x27;s way and was quitting. As she was walking out, Beatty stopped her, and asked what was wrong. &quot;I sat down and told him,&quot; she said. &quot;He threw up his hands and said, &#x27;Play it your way. What do I know? I&#x27;m a man.&#x27;&quot;
Despite the success of the film and her career, Grant was feeling less secure in Hollywood, as she was then around 50 years old. She writes:
During the 1975-76 television season, she starred in the sitcom &quot;Fay&quot;, which, to her chagrin, was canceled after eight episodes. In 1977, she starred in the ensemble disaster movie &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; and in 1978, she was the lead actress in the horror film &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot;, also starring William Holden. Both films drew negative reviews, though they were financially successful. She made a guest appearance in &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, in which her daughter Dinah Manoff co-starred.

In the late 1970s, Grant was asked by the American Film Institute to participate in the first AFI Directing Workshop for Women. During the workshop, Grant successfully moved into directing when she adapted the play &quot;The Stronger&quot; in 1976, written by August Strindberg.

===1980s1990s===
In 1980, Grant directed her first feature film, &quot;Tell Me a Riddle&quot;, a story about an aging Jewish couple. That debut narrative film was followed by a widely distributed documentary film titled &quot;The Willmar 8&quot;, which profiled eight female employees of a bank in Willmar, Minnesota who went on strike to protest pay inequities between male and female bank tellers. Grant went on to direct many documentaries on a variety of social issues: women in prison with &quot;When Women Kill&quot; (1983), transgender individuals with &quot;What Sex Am I?&quot; (1985), women experiencing domestic abuse with &quot;Battered&quot; (1989), and women trying to keep custody of their children in court in &quot;Women on Trial&quot; (1992).
In 1986, Grant directed &quot;Down and Out in America&quot; (1986) which won the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. The film was about farm workers losing their farms, homelessness, and unemployment in America. The same year, she directed &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, a television movie starring Marlo Thomas about a woman confined to a mental institution for 20 years. Grant became the first female director to win the Directors Guild of America Award.

She starred in an HBO remake of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; in 1982, co-starring with Jerry Orbach, both playing three different characters in three acts. It was filmed before a live audience. Actor Bruce Dern, who acted with her in &quot;The Big Town&quot; (1987), recalls working with her: &quot;Lee Grant is a fabulous actress. Anytime she works it&#x27;s a blessing you have her in your movie.&quot;

In 1988, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.

Admiring her directing and acting skill, actress Sissy Spacek agreed to act in the romantic comedy &quot;Hard Promises&quot; (1991) &quot;only to work with Grant&quot;, although Grant was later replaced as its director. In 1992, Grant played Dora Cohn, the mother of Roy Cohn in the biographical made-for-TV film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;, which garnered her another Primetime Emmy Award nomination. In 1994, she directed the television film &quot;Seasons of the Heart&quot;, starring Carol Burnett and George Segal.

===2000s–present===
In 2001, Lee Grant portrayed Louise Bonner in David Lynch&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. From 2004 to 2007, Carlin Glynn, Stephen Lang, and Grant served as co-artistic directors for the Actors Studio. In the early 2000s, Grant directed a series of &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; episodes for Lifetime Television, that celebrated a diverse range of accomplished women.

In 2013, Grant briefly returned to the stage, after a nearly forty-year absence, to star in one performance of &quot;The Gin Game&quot;, part of a benefit for improvement programs at the Island Music Guild, in Bainbridge Island, Washington. Grant played Fonsia Dorsey opposite Frank Buxton as Weller Martin; her daughter Dinah Manoff directed the production.

After a fourteen-year hiatus, Lee Grant played a small part in the film &quot;Killian &amp; the Comeback Kids&quot; (2020), directed by Taylor A. Purdee.

Grant&#x27;s career making documentaries in the 1980s and 1990s was honored with an appearance on the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI Docs at its Guggenheim Symposium and with a program, &quot;20th Century Woman: The Documentary Films of Lee Grant&quot;, on AFI Silver and other virtual cinemas in mid-2020. This became the first virtual repertory film series in America.

As of 2022, she is still the only Academy Award-winning actor to also direct an Academy Award-winning documentary.

In January 2024, she attended the New York Film Festival, where the first two films she directed were shown in the revivals program, and talked about her directing career in a panel hosted by Turner Classic Movies.

<doc id="768158" wikidata="Q2304346" url="?curid=768158" title="Federal funds rate">
<text>In the United States, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (banks and credit unions) lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis. Reserve balances are amounts held at the Federal Reserve. Institutions with surplus balances in their accounts lend those balances to institutions in need of larger balances. The federal funds rate is an important benchmark in financial markets and central to the conduct of monetary policy in the United States as it influences a wide range of market interest rates.

The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) is calculated as the effective median interest rate of overnight federal funds transactions during the previous business day. It is published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The federal funds target range is determined by a meeting of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which normally occurs eight times a year about seven weeks apart. The committee may also hold additional meetings and implement target rate changes outside of its normal schedule.

The Federal Reserve adjusts its administratively set interest rates, mainly the interest on reserve balances (IORB), to bring the effective rate into the target range. Additional tools at the Fed&#x27;s disposal are: the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, discount rate, and open market operations. The target range is chosen to influence market interest rates generally and in turn ultimately the level of activity, employment and inflation in the U.S. economy.

==Mechanism==
Financial institutions are obligated by law to hold liquid assets that can be used to cover sustained net cash outflows. Among these assets are the deposits that the institutions maintain, directly or indirectly, with a Federal Reserve Bank. An institution that is below its desired level of liquidity can address this temporarily by borrowing from institutions that have Federal Reserve deposits in excess of their requirement. The interest rate that a borrowing bank pays to a lending bank to borrow the funds is negotiated between the two banks, and the weighted average of this rate across all such transactions is the &quot;effective&quot; federal funds rate.

The Federal Open Market Committee regularly sets a target range for the federal funds rate according to its policy goals and the economic conditions of the United States. It directs the Federal Reserve Banks to influence the rate toward that range with adjustments to their own deposit interest rates. Although this is commonly referred to as &quot;setting interest rates,&quot; the effect is not immediate and depends on the banks&#x27; response to money market conditions.

Future contracts in the federal funds rate trade on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the financial press refer to these contracts when estimating the probabilities of upcoming FOMC actions.

===How the Fed attains its target rates===
Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is the primary tool for achieving the target federal funds rate. It is an interest rate the Fed pays to banks for holding their funds at the Federal Reserve Bank. Because this offers a risk-free way to earn interest on their funds, banks do not tend to lend to each other at rates below the IORB, effectively setting a floor for the federal funds rate.

Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility is how the Fed sets rates for financial institutions which do not qualify to earn the IORB. It does this by allowing them to earn an interest on their funds via reverse repurchase agreements with the Fed. This helps further ensure a floor to the federal funds rate.

Discount rate is the interest rate at which the Fed loans out its funds to eligible institutions via the discount window. This makes it unlikely for banks or other institutions to make loans at higher rates, therefore effectively setting a ceiling to the federal funds rate.

Open Market Operations is when the Federal Reserve buys or sells government securities, thereby either adding or removing liquidity from the banking system. Without sufficient liquidity in the system, the other tools Fed uses become ineffective.

==Applications==
Interbank borrowing is essentially a way for banks to quickly raise money. For example, a bank may want to finance a major industrial effort but may not have the time to wait for deposits or interest (on loan payments) to come in. In such cases the bank will quickly raise this amount from other banks at an interest rate equal to or higher than the Federal funds rate.

Raising the federal funds rate will dissuade banks from taking out such inter-bank loans, which in turn will make cash that much harder to procure. Conversely, dropping the interest rates will encourage banks to borrow money and therefore invest more freely. This interest rate is used as a regulatory tool to control how freely the U.S. economy operates.

By setting a higher discount rate the Federal Reserve discourages banks from requisitioning funds from Federal Reserve Banks, yet positions itself as a lender of last resort.

==Comparison with LIBOR==
Though the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the federal funds rate are concerned with the same action, i.e. interbank loans, they are distinct from one another, as follows:
* The target federal funds rate is a target interest rate that is set by the FOMC for implementing U.S. monetary policies.
* The (effective) federal funds rate is achieved through open market operations at the Domestic Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which deals primarily in domestic securities (U.S. Treasury and federal agencies&#x27; securities).
* LIBOR is based on a questionnaire where a selection of banks guess the rates at which they could borrow money from other banks.
* LIBOR may or may not be used to derive business terms. It is not fixed beforehand and is not meant to have macroeconomic ramifications.

==Predictions by the market==
Considering the wide impact a change in the federal funds rate can have on the value of the dollar and the amount of lending going to new economic activity, the Federal Reserve is closely watched by the market. The prices of Option contracts on fed funds futures (traded on the Chicago Board of Trade) can be used to infer the market&#x27;s expectations of future Fed policy changes. Based on CME Group 30-Day Fed Fund futures prices, which have long been used to express the market&#x27;s views on the likelihood of changes in U.S. monetary policy, the CME Group FedWatch tool allows market participants to view the probability of an upcoming Fed Rate hike. One set of such &quot;implied probabilities&quot; is published by the Cleveland Fed.

==Historical rates==
The last full cycle of rate increases occurred between June 2004 and June 2006 as rates steadily rose from 1.00% to 5.25%. The target rate remained at 5.25% for over a year, until the Federal Reserve began lowering rates in September 2007. The last cycle of easing monetary policy through the rate was conducted from September 2007 to December 2008 as the target rate fell from 5.25% to a range of 0.00–0.25%. Between December 2008 and December 2015 the target rate remained at 0.00–0.25%, the lowest rate in the Federal Reserve&#x27;s history, as a reaction to the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and its aftermath. According to Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, one reason for this unprecedented move of having a range, rather than a specific rate, was because a rate of 0% could have had problematic implications for money market funds, whose fees could then outpace yields. In October 2019 the target range for the Federal Funds Rate was 1.50–1.75%. On March 15, 2020, the target range for Federal Funds Rate was 0.00–0.25%, a full percentage point drop less than two weeks after being lowered to 1.00–1.25%.

In light of the 2021–2022 global inflation surge, the Federal Reserve has raised the FFR aggressively. In the latter half of 2022, the FOMC had hiked the FFR by 0.75 percentage points on 4 different consecutive occasions, and in its final meeting of 2022, hiked the FFR a further 0.5 percentage points. The FFR sat around 4.4% in 2022, and at the time the Fed foreshadowed that the rate would not be lowered until 2024 at the earliest.

In Sept. 2024, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate for the first time since 2020 by 50 basis points.

==Explanation of federal funds rate decisions==
When the FOMC wishes to reduce interest rates they will increase the supply of money by buying government securities. When additional supply is added and everything else remains constant, the price of borrowed funds – the federal funds rate – falls. Conversely, when the Committee wishes to increase the federal funds rate, they will instruct the Desk Manager to sell government securities, thereby taking the money they earn on the proceeds of those sales out of circulation and reducing the money supply. When supply is taken away and everything else remains constant, the interest rate will normally rise.

The Federal Reserve has responded to a potential slow-down by lowering the target federal funds rate during recessions and other periods of lower growth. In fact, the committee&#x27;s lowering has recently predated recessions, in order to stimulate the economy and cushion the fall. Reducing the federal funds rate makes money cheaper, allowing an influx of credit into the economy through all types of loans.

The charts referenced below show the relation between S&amp;P 500 and interest rates.

* July 13, 1990 – Sept 4, 1992: 8.00–3.00% (Includes 1990–1991 recession)
* Feb 1, 1995 – Nov 17, 1998: 6.00–4.75 
* May 16, 2000 – June 25, 2003: 6.50–1.00 (Includes 2001 recession)
* June 29, 2006 – Oct 29, 2008: 5.25–1.00

Bill Gross of PIMCO suggested that in the prior 15 years ending in 2007, in each instance where the fed funds rate was higher than the nominal GDP growth rate, assets such as stocks and housing fell.

==International effects==
A low federal funds rate makes investments in developing countries such as China or Mexico more attractive. A high federal funds rate makes investments outside the United States less attractive. The long period of a very low federal funds rate from 2009 forward resulted in an increase in investment in developing countries. As the United States began to return to a higher rate in the end of 2015 investments in the United States became more attractive and the rate of investment in developing countries began to fall. The rate also affects the value of currency, a higher rate slowing the decrease of the U.S. dollar and decreasing the value of currencies such as the Mexican peso.

<text>USS &quot;Abraham&quot;—formerly CSS &quot;Victoria&quot;—was a side-wheel steamer captured by the Union Navy from the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.

&quot;Abraham&quot;—a capacious ship of —served primarily as a storeship, conveying supplies to Union vessels in the battle area and at times, during such missions, getting struck by enemy shell.

==Service history==
Early in the Civil War, &quot;Victoria&quot;—built at Elizabeth, Pennsylvania in 1858 and based at St. Louis—was acquired by the Confederate Government for service as a troop transport on the waters of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. In the spring of 1862, Union warships of the Western Flotilla, commanded at first by Flag Officer Andrew Foote and then by Flag Officer Charles Davis, relentlessly fought their way downstream from Cairo, Illinois. On 6 June, they met Southern river forces in the First Battle of Memphis and won a decisive victory which gave the North control of the Mississippi River above Vicksburg, Mississippi. Later that day, the Union gunboats found and took possession of several Confederate vessels moored at the wharf at Memphis. &quot;Victoria&quot; was one of these prizes.

Davis used the riverboat as a storeship and an inspection vessel for his flotilla until that organization, an Army outfit commanded by naval officers, was transferred to the Navy on 1 October and renamed the Mississippi Squadron. Two weeks later, on the 15th, &quot;Victoria&quot; was renamed &quot;Abraham&quot; and continued to serve the Union cause in the same capacity. While not exposed to the hazards of combat, the ship constantly suffered the perils of life on the upper Mississippi River and, on several occasions, was threatened by fires on nearby vessels.

For example, on the night of 7 February 1863, she moored astern of the gunboat when she caught fire; and &quot;Abraham&quot; only escaped when &quot;Glide&quot; was cut adrift, pushed out into the current by the tug , and allowed to drift downstream. On 9 May 1864, &quot;Abraham&quot; moved from Cairo to Mound City, Illinois, where she served through the end of the Civil War. After the collapse of the Confederacy, &quot;Abraham&quot; was taken out of service and laid up at Mound City until sold there to L.C. and R.N Alexander on 30 September. Redocumented &quot;Lexington&quot; on 16 March 1866, the side-wheeler served private interests on the Mississippi until she caught fire at Algiers, Louisiana on 3 February 1869 and burned until she was a total loss.

<text>Walter Forward (January 24, 1786 – November 24, 1852) was an American lawyer and politician. He was the brother of Chauncey Forward and Oliver Forward.

==Biography==
Born in East Granby, Connecticut, he attended the common schools. After moving with his father to Aurora, Ohio, he settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1803. There he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1806. He practiced in Pittsburgh and also served for more than a year as editor of &quot;The Tree of Liberty&quot; newspaper. He also served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

In 1822, he was elected to the 17th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Henry Baldwin, and was reelected to the 18th Congress. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1824 to the 19th Congress. He was a member of the Pennsylvania constitutional convention in 1837 and played an important role in the establishment of the United States Whig Party in the 1830s.

Forward was an active supporter of the Harrison-Tyler ticket in the U.S. presidential election, 1840. As a reward, Forward was offered the office of United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. He declined that appointment but on March 6, 1841 was appointed by President William Henry Harrison to be First Comptroller of the Treasury. He served in that post until September 13, 1841, when he was appointed 15th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler.

During his tenure as Treasury Secretary, the Independent Treasury System of 1840 was abolished, and the government&#x27;s funds were deposited once more with commercial banks. Soon after Forward took office, he was asked by Millard Fillmore, then chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, to devise a plan to increase the tariff, in response to the serious decrease in revenue caused by the Panic of 1837. He was also asked to develop plans for a &quot;Board of Exchequer&quot; to receive and disburse customs revenue, since the Independent Treasury System was no longer in effect. In August 1842 a strongly protective tariff was passed. Since constant friction with the new President marred his entire tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, he left Tyler&#x27;s cabinet on February 28, 1843.

After leaving his Cabinet post, Forward resumed the practice of law in Pittsburgh until 1849, when he was appointed Chargé d&#x27;Affaires to Denmark by President Zachary Taylor. He returned from Denmark in 1851 to serve as presiding judge of the district court of Allegheny County. He died in Pittsburgh and is interred in Allegheny Cemetery.

==Honors==
Forward Township in Allegheny County is named for Walter Forward, as is the Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Forward (WMEC-911).

<text>Little Joe 5 was the November 8, 1960, unmanned atmospheric test flight of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the U.S. Mercury program. The objective was to test a production Mercury capsule (#3) and the launch escape system during an ascent abort at maximum dynamic pressure. The mission was launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. Sixteen seconds after liftoff, the escape rocket and the tower jettison rocket both fired prematurely. Furthermore, the booster, capsule, and escape tower failed to separate as intended. The entire stack was destroyed on impact with the Atlantic Ocean. The Little Joe 5 flew to an apogee of 10.1 miles (16.2 km) and a range of 13 miles (20.9 km). Some capsule and booster debris was recovered from the ocean floor for post flight analysis.

<text>Stephanie of Milly (born ) was the lady of Oultrejordain in 1169–1197 and an influential figure in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. She was also known as Stephanie de Milly, Etienette de Milly, and Etiennette de Milly. She married three times; firstly to Humphrey III of Toron, secondly to Miles of Plancy; her third and last husband was Raynald of Chatillon.

==Family and early life==

She was the younger daughter of Philip of Milly, lord of Nablus, and Isabella of Oultrejordain, who herself was the daughter and heiress of Maurice of Montreal, lord of Oultrejordain. Through her various marriages, several of her husbands became lords of Oultrejordain. Her first marriage, in 1163, was to Humphrey III of Toron, who died in 1173. This marriage produced two children: a son, Humphrey (the future Humphrey IV of Toron), and a daughter, Isabella, who married Ruben III of Armenia. Her second husband was Miles of Plancy, lord of Oultrejordain, who was assassinated in 1174.

==Third marriage==
In 1177, she married Raynald of Châtillon, the former Prince of Antioch, who had recently been released from captivity in Aleppo. Through Stephanie, Raynald succeeded as lord &quot;jure uxoris&quot; of the lordship of Oultrejordain, and used his new position to harass Muslim caravan and pilgrimage routes; in 1183 he even threatened to attack Mecca itself. In 1180, Baldwin IV of Jerusalem had betrothed his eight-year-old half-sister Isabella to Stephanie&#x27;s son Humphrey. The marriage took place in the castle of Kerak in 1183. The ceremonies were interrupted by the arrival of Saladin, who besieged the place in response to Raynald&#x27;s threats against Mecca. According to the chronicle of Ernoul, Stephanie sent messengers to Saladin, reminding him of the friendship they shared when he had been a prisoner in Kerak many years before; this is likely a fiction or some mis-remembered event, as Saladin is not otherwise known to have ever been held hostage at Kerak. Saladin did not lift the siege but agreed not to target Humphrey and Isabella&#x27;s wedding chamber. The siege was soon raised by King Baldwin. The &quot;Old French Continuation of William of Tyre&quot; claimed that Stephanie hated Isabella&#x27;s mother Maria Comnena, and prevented her having any contact with her daughter. This was probably for political reasons: Baldwin had arranged the marriage to remove the little girl from the influence of her stepfather&#x27;s family, the Ibelins.

==Capture of Humphrey==
Raynald continued to harass the caravan and pilgrimage routes, leading to the invasion of the kingdom by Saladin in 1187. Raynald was killed at the ensuing Battle of Hattin, at which Humphrey IV was captured. Saladin agreed to return Humphrey to Stephanie in exchange for Kerak and Montreal; the castles refused to surrender, however, and Stephanie dutifully sent her son back to captivity under Saladin. Saladin took pity on her and released him. Her own principality of Oultrejordain and its castles were lost to Saladin within a few years of Hattin, and, located so far from the Mediterranean coast where the remaining crusader strongholds were located, remained in Muslim hands.

As her son Humphrey had apparently died before her, Stephanie&#x27;s heiress (as well as the heiress of Toron) was her daughter, Isabella.

<doc id="768186" wikidata="Q7866984" url="?curid=768186" title="SS Absaroka">
<text>SS &quot;Absaroka was a [[steamship|steamer]], named after the [[Absaroka Range]] of mountains in [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]], completed in February 1918 for the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB) which briefly operated the ship. From 17 September 1918 to 4 March 1919 the ship was commissioned asUSS &quot;Absaroka with the identification number IX-2581 in United States Navy and operated by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service.

The ship was returned to the USSB which operated the vessel until sold in 1927 to McCormick Steamship Company. In 1940 &quot;Absaroka&quot; was sold to Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. which operated it until sold foreign in April 1946. On 24 December 1941 the ship was torpedoed and damaged by torpedo off the California coast. During World War II the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took control of all oceanic shipping with &quot;Absaroka&quot; delivered to WSA 9 May 1942 to be operated by Pope &amp; Talbot for WSA under Army and general standard agreements. On 9 April 1946 the ship was redelivered to Pope &amp; Talbot and sold 14 April 1946 to the Greek government and then operated as Prima Vista or Primavista until 1948. The ship was then sold to other foreign interests operating as Panenterprise to 1952 and finally Maryland until broken up in 1954.

== Construction ==
&quot;Absaroka&quot; was an Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) Design 1013 cargo ship built in 1917 for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) by Skinner &amp; Eddy Company, Seattle, Washington as USSB number 84, yard number 15, U.S. Official Number 215986 with signal LJQR. The single 2,700 h.p. triple expansion steam engine was built by Seattle Machine Works.

== Operation ==
The USSB took delivery of &quot;Absaroka&quot; on completion in February 1918 for operation. On 17 September 1918 the ship was taken over by the Navy on a bare boat charter basis, assigned identification number IX-2581 and commissioned USS &quot;Absaroka&quot; under the command of Lieutenant commander O. W. Hughes for operation in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS).

Between October 1918 and February 1919, the ship made two transatlantic voyages carrying Army cargo to ports in France, England, and the Netherlands. During her second trip, &quot;Absaroka&quot; rescued the captain and crew of the disabled British steamer &quot;War Marvel&quot; and landed them safely at Falmouth, England.

The ship arrived in New York City on 12 February 1919 and was immediately drydocked for overhaul. &quot;Absaroka&quot; was decommissioned on 4 March 1919 and returned to the United States Shipping Board. The USSB sold the ship with requirements for specified alterations and improvements to the McCormick Steamship Company for $131,000 before 30 June 1927. From 1927 to 1940 &quot;Absaroka&quot; was operated by McCormick which in 1935 was acquired by Pope &amp; Talbot, Incorporated to become legally identified as the Pope &amp; Talbot-McCormick Steamship Division. From 1940 the ship was operated as a lumber carrier under the Pope &amp; Talbot identity.
&quot;Absaroka&quot; was torpedoed and damaged by the off Point Fermin, California, and beached off Fort MacArthur on 24 December 1941. The attack was one of the opening incidents of what is called the Battle of Los Angeles during which American merchant ships were attacked by Japanese submarines in waters off the West Coast from the last half of December 1941 through February 1942. Other ships attacked during this event were , escaped shelling and torpedoes as did , , &quot;Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; but with damage. &quot;H.M. Storey&quot; escaped but sank later. , , , &quot;Camden&quot; and were sunk.

The ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 9 May 1942 for operation by Pope &amp; Talbot as the administration&#x27;s agent. The operating agreement was for Army Transportation Corps requirements until 16 August 1943 when it was changed to a General Agency Agreement. On 9 April 1946 &quot;Absaroka&quot; was delivered to Pope &amp; Talbot as owner at San Francisco.

==Post-war service==
On 14 April 1946 Pope &amp; Talbot sold &quot;Absaroka&quot; to the Greek government. It passed into the ownership of J A Cosmas, and was registered in Panama as &quot;Primavista&quot; or &quot;Prima Vista&quot; under the registered ownership of Compañia Marítima Samsoc Limitada S.A., Panama. In 1948 the vessel was sold to Primavista Compañia de Navegación S.A., under the management of Pietro Ruggiero, and remaining under the Panamanian flag as &quot;Panenterprise&quot;. In 1948-49 the ship made at least three trips from Europe to Buenos Aires and brought a small number of immigrants. The ship was again sold in 1952, again with Panamanian registration, and renamed &quot;Maryland&quot; in the ownership of The Tidewater Commercial Company Inc., based in Baltimore, Maryland, though controlled by the Italian shipowner Albert Ravano.

The ship was broken up in 1954, either by Patapsco Scrap Company at Baltimore, or by Shipbreaking Industries Ltd, Faslane, Scotland, arriving on 9 April.

<doc id="768188" wikidata="Q7417304" url="?curid=768188" title="Sandy Hook Light">
<text>The Sandy Hook Lighthouse, located about one and a half statute miles (2.4 km) inland from the tip of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, is the oldest working lighthouse in the United States. It was designed and built on June 11, 1764 by Isaac Conro. At that time, it stood only from the tip of Sandy Hook; however, today, due to growth caused by littoral drift, it is almost inland from the tip. It was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, for its significance in commerce and transportation.

==History==
The light was built to aid mariners entering the southern end of the New York Harbor. It was originally called New York Lighthouse because it was funded through a New York Assembly lottery and a tax on all ships entering the Port of New York. The lighthouse has endured an attempt to destroy it as an aid to British navigation by Benjamin Tupper, and a subsequent occupancy of British soldiers during the Revolutionary War.

Almost two years after the State of New York ratified the U.S. Constitution, the lighthouse was transferred to federal authority. George Washington wrote to the Senate on April 5, 1790, &quot;I have directed my private secretary to lay before you copies of three acts of the legislature of New York ... An act for vesting in the United States of America the light-house and the lands thereunto belonging at Sandy Hook&quot;. The lighthouse is located on the grounds of Fort Hancock.

In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 25 cent stamp featuring the Sandy Hook Lighthouse.

==Today==

Sandy Hook Lighthouse, which was restored in spring 2000, is part of the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area administered by the National Park Service. Tour times can be found at the park website. The view from the top includes the Atlantic Ocean, Sandy Hook Bay and the New York City skyline. 


==In popular culture==
*On September 18, 2009 the Sandy Hook Light was filmed as a fictional backdrop for final episode of the longest running soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

<doc id="768191" wikidata="Q608841" url="?curid=768191" title="Arvirargus">
<text>Arvirargus or Arviragus was a legendary British king of the 1st century AD, possibly based upon a real person. A shadowy historical Arviragus is known only from a cryptic reference in a satirical poem by Juvenal, in which a giant turbot presented to the Roman emperor Domitian (81–96 AD) is said to be an omen that &quot;you will capture some king, or Arviragus will fall from his British chariot-pole&quot;.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth==
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (1136) presents a legendary Arviragus who is contemporary with the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). However, Geoffrey&#x27;s work is highly romanticised and contains little trustworthy historical fact, rendering his account of Arvirargus suspect.

According to Geoffrey, Arvirargus is a son of the former king Kimbelinus. He succeeds to the throne of Britain after his elder brother, Guiderius, dies fighting the invading Romans under Claudius. Arviragus puts on his brother&#x27;s armour and leads the army of the Britons against the Romans. When he learns that Claudius and his commander, Hamo, have fled into the woods, Arvirargus follows him until they reach the coast. The Britons kill Hamo as he tries to flee onto a ship and the place is named Southampton after him. Claudius is able to reassemble his troops elsewhere and he besieges Portchester until it falls to his forces.

Following Hamo&#x27;s death, Arvirargus seeks refuge at Winchester, but Claudius follows him there with his army. The Britons break the siege and attack the Romans, but Claudius halts the attack and offers a treaty. In exchange for peace and tribute with Rome, Claudius offers Arvirargus his own daughter in marriage. They accept each other&#x27;s terms and Arvirargus aids Claudius in subduing Orkney and other northern lands.

In the following spring, Arvirargus weds Claudius&#x27; daughter, Genvissa, and names the city of Gloucester after her father. Following the wedding, Claudius leaves Britain in the control of Arvirargus. In the years following Claudius&#x27; departure, Arvirargus rebuilds the cities that have been ruined and becomes feared by his neighbours. This causes him to halt his tribute to Rome, forcing Claudius to send Vespasian with an army to Britain. As Vespasian prepares to land, such a large British force stands ready that he flees to another port, Totnes, where he sets up camp.

Once a base is established, he marches to Exeter and besieges the city. Arvirargus meets him in battle there and the fight is stalemated. The following morning, Queen Genvissa mediates peace between the two foes. Vespasian returns to Rome and Arvirargus rules the country peacefully for some years. When he finally dies, he is buried in Gloucester, the city he built with Claudius. He is succeeded by his son, Marius.

Geoffrey&#x27;s legendary Arvirargus appears to correspond to some degree to the historical Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, who, along with his brother Togodumnus, led the initial resistance to the Roman invasion of 43 AD, and went on to be a thorn in Rome&#x27;s side for nearly a decade after Togodumnus&#x27;s death. Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; call him Gweirydd and his brother Gwydr.

==Cultural legacy==
The just husband in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s The Franklin&#x27;s Tale (one of the Canterbury Tales) is named Arveragus; however, he appears to have little else in common with the figure of Arvirargus.

Arvirargus is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. He and his brother Guiderius had been kidnapped in childhood by Belarius, a nobleman wrongly banished by Cymbeline, and brought up in secret in Wales, but are reunited with their father and sister Imogen in time for the Roman invasion.

The records of Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels) show that a play called &quot;Arviragus&quot; was performed at the Court of Charles I on 26 and 27 December 1636.

<doc id="768194" wikidata="Q719173" url="?curid=768194" title="Al Unser Jr.">
<text>Alfred Unser Jr. (born April 19, 1962) – nicknamed &quot;Little Al&quot; to distinguish him from his father, Al Unser – is an American former racing driver. Known primarily for his Championship car career, Unser won two CART championships, and is a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500.

Early in his career, Unser found success in the Can-Am series, winning the championship in 1982. He joined his great uncle, uncle, and father, as a winner of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb, doing so in 1983. He is a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona. He has the most Long Beach Grand Prix victories in history, winning six times.

==History==
Unser was born into a racing family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is the son of Al Unser and the nephew of Bobby Unser, both Indianapolis 500 winners themselves. The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times.

===Early career===
By the age of 11, Al Junior was racing sprint cars. After high school, he was already in the World of Outlaws series of sprint car racing. He soon moved into road racing, winning the Super Vee title in 1981 and the Can-Am title in 1982.

===Rising CART star===
In 1982, Unser made his debut on the CART circuit. He suffered personal tragedy when his sister Debbie was killed in a dune buggy accident, but this did not deter Unser; and a year later, he competed in his first Indianapolis 500, finishing 9th. Hours after the race ended, Unser Jr. was issued a 2-lap penalty by chief steward Thomas W. Binford for passing 2 cars under caution with less than 40 laps to go as well as blocking eventual winner Tom Sneva from passing his father with less than 20 laps to go. The penalty dropped him from an original finish of 9th to 10th. Despite being lauded for his performance as a rookie, Unser Jr. narrowly lost the rookie of the year award to Teo Fabi.

Unser continued racing on the CART circuit, becoming one of the series&#x27; rising stars. He finished second in the CART championship point standings in 1985, losing to his father by just one point. He began competing in the IROC championship in 1986, winning that championship with two victories in four races. At the age of 24, Unser was the youngest IROC champion ever. Unser won the 1986 and 1988 IROC championships, the final Indycar driver to win an IROC championship. Unser won the 24 Hours of Daytona, also at age 24 for the first time in 1986 and again in 1987.

Unser continued to improve on the CART circuit, finishing fourth in the points standings in 1986, third in 1987, second in 1988 and finally winning the series for the first time in 1990. In 1989, Unser was on the verge of winning his first Indianapolis 500, but while battling with Emerson Fittipaldi for the lead the two touched wheels and Unser spun, hitting the wall and ending his chances. This race is remembered for a remarkable show of sportsmanship, as Little Al climbed out of his wrecked racecar and gave Fittipaldi the &quot;thumbs up&quot; as he drove by Unser under caution. Unser would have his day at Indy in 1992, however, defeating Scott Goodyear by 0.043 seconds, the closest finish in Indianapolis 500 history.

During the off-season he drove in the 1993 Daytona 500 for Hendrick Motorsports finishing 36th in his only NASCAR start. He ran well in the race, running with the lead pack all day, until a late race crash with Kyle Petty and Bobby Hillin Jr. During an interview with Mike Joy after the accident, Joy asked him if he would be back. Unser said that he wanted to come back, but it would never happen. Unser also tested a Williams F1 car but never competed in the series.

===Penske years===
In 1994, Unser again won at Indy, this time with Penske Racing. His teammates were Emerson Fittipaldi, the man whom he battled with five years before, and Paul Tracy. Unser turned in a dominant season-long performance, winning eight of 16 races on his way to his second CART championship, as well as being named ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year that year. In 1995 Unser, along with teammate Emerson Fittipaldi, failed to qualify at Indianapolis, and he would later point to this as the trigger event for his descent into alcoholism and the breakup of his marriage. He would finish second to Jacques Villeneuve in CART championship points in 1995. He finished fourth in 1996, despite having a chance of winning the championship until the end of the season.

Unser ranked 13th in 1997, 11th in 1998 and 21st in 1999, not helped by the fact that he had to sit out two races after breaking his leg in the season-opener at Miami in a first-lap accident. Little Al&#x27;s decline in performance coincided with the Penske team&#x27;s struggles with their in-house chassis, Mercedes engines and Goodyear tires, which were being abandoned by most teams during this era in favor of Firestones. His teammates suffered similarly disappointing results during this time.

Team Penske began abandoning the maligned in-house Penske chassis for customer Lola chassis during the 1999 season. By the end of 1999, Unser and Penske parted ways and, combined with the death of Gonzalo Rodríguez, Penske replaced Unser and Rodriguez with Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran. Unser would leave CART to join the budding Indy Racing League for the 2000 campaign.

Unser won a total of 31 races during his 17 seasons in CART. His career win total including IRL stands at 34, which is currently the sixth-most all-time in American open-wheel racing (as of 2013). As a two-time Indy 500 and two-time overall points champion, Unser enjoyed a decorated career as one of the most dynamic and successful drivers in American auto racing.(9)

===Indy Racing League===
Unser would go on to win a total of three races in his IRL career, but after breaking his pelvis in an all-terrain vehicle accident in October 2003, Unser had difficulty securing a ride for the 2004 season. He finally signed with Patrick Racing three races into the season, but after a 22nd-place finish in Richmond, Unser finally announced his retirement from racing on June 30, 2004. Unser continued to remain involved in racing, however, outside of a driving capacity. He served as an adviser for Patrick Racing and worked as a mentor for his son, Al Richard Unser, who was working his way through the lower ranks of open-wheel racing at the time.

===Post-retirement racing and personal issues===

In 2006 Unser announced that he would come back to racing again and he would run the 2006 Indianapolis 500, teamed with fellow former winner Buddy Lazier for Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing. This came just days after Michael Andretti also came out of retirement to run the 500. Unser qualified 27th in the 33-car field, and consistently ran in the upper half until a crash ended his day.

In late August, Unser took part in an A1 Grand Prix test session at Silverstone.

On 25 January 2007, Unser was arrested and charged with driving under the influence, misdemeanor hit and run, failure to render aid in an accident and failure to report an accident near Henderson, Nevada.

On 2 May 2007, it was announced that Unser would drive a car for racing legend A. J. Foyt in the 2007 Indianapolis 500, carrying the No. 50 on his car in recognition of A. J.&#x27;s 50 years at the storied race. Unser qualified in the 25th starting position after being bumped from the lineup on the second day of qualifying.

On 18 May 2007, Unser spoke publicly for the first time about his battle with alcoholism when he joined forces with &quot;LIVE outside the Bottle&quot;, a national educational campaign to help the public understand the need to address and treat alcoholism.

During the race weekend of the 2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, Unser confirmed that his IndyCar career was in fact over. During the weekend, he returned to the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race that he won in 1985, and scored his second win in the event and his eighth Long Beach victory overall.

In 2010, Unser started the Race Clinic for Paralysis charity.

Unser is on the board of Baltimore Racing Development and helped announce plans for the 2011 Baltimore Grand Prix on August 17, 2009.

Unser was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2009.

On September 29, 2011, Unser was arrested in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on charges of reckless driving and aggravated driving while intoxicated. Charges stemmed from an incident where Unser reportedly drag raced his Chevrolet Suburban SUV at speeds over . He was placed on indefinite suspension from his role with IndyCar.

In 2013, Unser entered a sportscar race at Thunderhill Raceway Park, the legendary 25 Hours of Thunderhill, racing with his son Al III as teammates. Unser dominated the race, but co-driver Ivan Bellarosa crashed the car out.

In 2014, once again at Long Beach, he participated in the Pro/Celebrity race, finishing fifth, 6.115 seconds behind winner Brett Davern and four other celebrities, winning the Pro Division (with a 30-second disadvantage assessed to professionals) for his ninth Long Beach victory overall, extending the &quot;King of the Beach&quot; nickname. Later that year, Unser raced again at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, participating in the Indy Legends Charity Pro/Am race, during the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association&#x27;s Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational event. This two-driver race included an Indianapolis 500 veteran in each car. Unser won the race, along with Peter Klutt, driving Klutt&#x27;s 1969 Chevrolet Corvette. In so doing, Unser became the second driver to win on both the oval and road course at the Speedway.

In 2015, Unser participated in several Goodguys AutoCross competitions while racing Speedway Motors&#x27; 1970 Camaro. He also raced in the Sports Car Club of America Solo National Championship, placing second in his class, and is entered again at Thunderhill for the 25 Hours. Because of his age (over 50), Unser is eligible to drop down a level from professional class to an &quot;amateur&quot; class (Silver level) under the FIA driver rankings used for sportscar races, although the National Auto Sport Association does not use such ratings.

On May 20, 2019, just days before the 2019 Indianapolis 500, Unser Jr. was charged for DUI for a fourth time.

On October 1, 2021, &quot;Unser&#x27;s memoir entitled A Checkered Past&quot;, co-authored by Jade Gurss, was published by Octane Press.

==Personal life==

Unser married Shelley; the couple later divorced. He has four children, Al Richard Unser, Cody Unser, Shannon Unser, and Joe Unser. Cody lost the use of her legs on February 5, 1999, when she was 12 years old.

<text>The Beach Cities are a collection of three independently incorporated oceanfront cities in Los Angeles County south of El Segundo and north of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, comprising the cities of Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach. They occupy the majority of the south end of Santa Monica Bay. Neighboring Torrance also shares a strip of beach property in the neighborhood of Torrance Beach, but the city of Torrance itself is generally excluded from the group.

The three cities share public agencies including the Beach Cities Transit District (with El Segundo) and the Beach Cities Health District.

All three are known for their beaches and municipal piers. They are popular with swimmers, surfers, bodyboarders, and other beachgoers. The Marvin Braude Bike Trail runs along the beaches and is used for pedestrian and cyclist transportation between the cities, as well as recreational cycling, running and rollerblading.

<text>David Lee Henderson (July 21, 1958 – December 27, 2015), nicknamed &quot;Hendu&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, and Kansas City Royals during his 14-year career, primarily as an outfielder.

Henderson is best remembered for the two-out, two-strike home run he hit in the top of the ninth inning in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series. He helped his teams reach the World Series four times during his career—Boston in 1986 and Oakland from 1988 to 1990, with Oakland winning the championship in 1989. His uncle Joe Henderson appeared in 16 MLB games as a pitcher during the mid-1970s.

==Road to the majors==
Henderson was born in Merced, California and grew up in nearby Dos Palos, where he attended high school and played both baseball and football. With the football team, which won championships in 1975 and 1976, he played tight end, running back, and strong safety. One of his baseball teammates was future College World Series MVP Stan Holmes. The team won championships in 1976 and 1977. Henderson&#x27;s uniform numbers—42 in football, 22 in baseball—were both retired by the Dos Palos Broncos, which inducted him into the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2012 and named their baseball field in his honor.

Henderson was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. His first professional season was 1977 with the Bellingham Mariners of the Class A short season Northwest League, where he played in 65 games, batting .315 with 16 home runs and 63 runs batted in (RBIs).

Henderson&#x27;s next two seasons were spent in the Class A California League. In 1978, he was with the Stockton Mariners, batting .232 with 7 home runs and 63 RBIs in 117 games. In 1979, he was with the San Jose Missions, batting .300 with 27 home runs and 99 RBIs in 136 games. In 1980, Henderson moved up to Class AAA, playing with the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, where he played in 109 games, batting .279 with 7 home runs and 50 RBIs.

==Major League Baseball==
===Seattle Mariners===
Entering the season, Henderson was named the Mariners&#x27; starting center fielder on Opening Day, going hitless in four at bats. His first MLB hit came several games into the season—a home run against Oakland pitcher Steve McCatty, after Henderson had been hitless in his first nine major league plate appearances. He struggled at the plate throughout the season; at the end of April, he was batting .135, which improved only slightly to .172 at the end of May. After then going 1-for-10 at the start of June, he was sent back down to Spokane in Class AAA.

Henderson spent much of the summer with Spokane, appearing in 80 games while batting .279 with 12 home runs and 50 RBIs. In early September, he was recalled, with his first appearance back with the Mariners coming on September 3, in a 20-inning game against the Red Sox—one of the longest MLB games ever played. From when he was recalled until the end of the season, he appeared mostly as a late-innings defensive replacement, finishing his first MLB year with a .167 average in 59 games played, with 6 home runs at 13 RBIs.
During the season, Henderson&#x27;s playing time increased significantly, as he appeared in 104 games, with 85 complete games played (all in center field). He batted .253 for the season, with 14 home runs and 48 RBIs. In , his batting average improved to .269 with 17 home runs and 55 RBIs, while appearing in 137 games, with 124 of them being complete games in the outfield (78 in center field and 46 in right field). Henderson spent some of the season on the disabled list because of a hamstring injury. Still, he hit well, batting .280 with 14 home runs and 43 RBIs in 112 games played with 78 complete games in the outfield (all but 9 in center). His batting average dropped somewhat in , as he hit .241 with 14 home runs and 68 RBIs, while appearing in 139 games with 117 of them being complete games in the outfield (all but 12 in center).

Early in the season, Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens became the first pitcher to record 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning game, which he accomplished in a game at Fenway Park against the Mariners, with Henderson being three of his strikeouts. Henderson struggled at the plate early in the season, batting below .200 as late as May 25. By the end of June, he had improved to .250, and he was batting .272 at the end of July.

Overall, Henderson played with Seattle for parts of six seasons, appearing in a total of 654 games, while batting .257 with 79 home runs and 271 RBIs.

===Boston Red Sox===
On August 19, 1986, the Red Sox, atop the American League East division, traded for Henderson and Mariner shortstop Spike Owen, sending Rey Quiñones, Mike Brown, Mike Trujillo, and a player to be named later to Seattle. Henderson was acquired as a backup for Boston center fielder Tony Armas. At the time of the trade, Henderson was batting .276 with 14 home runs and 44 RBIs, having appeared in 103 games.

Henderson joined the 1986 Red Sox on August 19, and appeared in 36 games over the remainder of the regular season, with just 7 complete games (all in center field). Most of his appearances were as a late-game defensive replacement in center field, or as a pinch hitter – he had only 51 at bats, collecting 10 hits (.196 average) with one home run and three RBIs. 

The Red Sox finished the season on top of the American League East – 5½ games ahead of the New York Yankees – and would face the winners of the American League West, the then California Angels, in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).

====1986 ALCS home run====
Henderson is best remembered for the two-out, two-strike home run he hit in the top of the ninth inning in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS.

At the time, the Angels were playing at home and were ahead in the series 3 games to 1 over the Red Sox. Henderson had appeared in Game 2 and Game 4 as a late-innings defensive replacement for Tony Armas, and was hitless in one at bat. In Game 5, Armas sprained his ankle in the second inning, and was replaced by Henderson, who entered the game to play centerfield in the bottom of the fifth inning. With the Red Sox leading 2–1 in the sixth inning, the Angels had a man on second with two-out, when Bobby Grich hit a deep fly ball Henderson attempted to catch on the warning track – the ball deflected off his glove and went over the wall, giving Grich a two-run home run. The Angels now had a 3–2 lead, with Henderson the likely scapegoat, should the Red Sox lose the game. Henderson batted in the seventh inning and struck out, while the Angels added two more runs in their half of the seventh.

The Angels had a 5–2 lead going into the ninth inning and were three outs away from their first-ever trip to the World Series, but the Red Sox closed the gap to 5–4 on a two-run home run by Don Baylor. When Henderson stepped to the plate to face reliever Donnie Moore, there were two outs and catcher Rich Gedman was on first after being hit by a pitch. After falling behind in the count 1-2 – the Angels now one strike away from advancing – Henderson took a ball to even the count at 2-2, and fouled off the next two pitches. Then, on Moore&#x27;s seventh pitch of the at bat, Henderson hit a drive to left that cleared the outfield wall, stunning the Angels and all of Anaheim Stadium. Henderson&#x27;s blast prompted television broadcast announcer Al Michaels to state, &quot;You’re looking at one for the ages here.”

The Angels tied the game 6–6 in the bottom of the ninth, and the game went into extra innings. In the top of the 11th, the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs, and Henderson hit a sacrifice fly Baylor scored on, which put the Red Sox ahead 7–6 and proved to be the margin of victory. Still down 3 games to 2 in the series, the Red Sox returned home to Fenway Park for the final two games, where they defeated the Angels 10–4 and 8–1 to capture the AL pennant. Henderson played center field for both of those games – collecting a walk and a run in each game, but going hitless – as Armas&#x27; injury kept him from playing. For the ALCS, Henderson finished 1-for-9 at the plate, with his only hit being the season-saving home run in Game 5.

====1986 World Series====
Henderson was the Red Sox&#x27; centerfielder throughout the 1986 World Series, as Tony Armas was sidelined by the injury he had sustained in the ALCS; Armas made only a single appearance, as a pinch hitter. Henderson hit .400 (10-for-25) in a losing cause, as the Red Sox were defeated by the New York Mets in seven games. Henderson hit two home runs – the first during the Red Sox&#x27; 9–3 win in Game 2, and the second came in the 10th inning of Game 6, giving the Red Sox a 4–3 lead in a game they would go on to lose 6–5.

====1987 season====
Henderson was Boston&#x27;s starting center fielder for the first month of the season, and during April he hit .239 (17-for-71, also 18 strikeouts) with 3 home runs and six RBIs. On April 30, the Red Sox called up rookie Ellis Burks from their minor league system, and Burks took over as the regular center fielder. Henderson saw his playing time decrease as he primarily played corner outfield positions, along with pinch hitting. At the end of May he was hitting .240, then he struggled during June, dropping to a .206 average. After having only six at bats in July, he received more playing time in August and raised his season totals to a .234 average with 8 home runs and 25 RBIs, but on September 1 the Red Sox traded him to the San Francisco Giants for a player to be named later (ultimately, Randy Kutcher).

Over parts of two seasons with Boston, Henderson played in 111 regular season games, batting .226 with nine home runs and 28 RBIs.

===San Francisco Giants===
Henderson spent the final month of the 1987 season with San Francisco, where he appeared in 15 games, batting for a .238 average. While the Giants won the National League West and were in the 1987 National League Championship Series, Henderson was acquired hours past the postseason roster deadline, thus was not eligible to play for the Giants in the playoffs. After the season, Henderson was granted free agency.

===Oakland Athletics===
====1988 season====
Henderson signed as a free agent with Oakland before the season, following his brief stint with the Giants. He was the Athletics&#x27; starting center fielder on Opening Day, and appeared in a total of 146 games, including 127 complete games in center field. His performance proved to be one of the season&#x27;s biggest surprises as he set career highs in batting average (.304), runs (100), hits (154), doubles (38), RBIs (94), and slugging percentage (.525). He also hit 24 home runs, and the Athletics were 23–1 when he homered. Henderson received consideration during AL MVP voting and finished 13th, with the award going to his Athletics teammate Jose Canseco.

The Athletics finished the season with a 104–58 record, and won the American League West by 13 games over the Minnesota Twins. In the 1988 ALCS, the Athletics faced the Red Sox and swept them in four games. Henderson batted 6-for-16 (.375) with one home run and four RBIs during the ALCS. The Athletics advanced to the 1988 World Series where they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games, including their Game 1 loss on Kirk Gibson&#x27;s famous home run. Henderson batted 6-for-20 (.300) with one RBI. Overall in the 1988 postseason he batted 12-for-36 (.333) with one home run and five RBIs, and he played center field for all of Oakland&#x27;s games.

====1989 season====
In Henderson was again the team&#x27;s primary center fielder, playing 134 complete games, and appearing in a total of 152 games during the season. His hitting wasn&#x27;t as good as the prior year, as he batted .250 (down from .304) and had 131 strikeouts (up from 92). He had 15 home runs and 80 RBIs. The Athletics had a 99–63 record to win the AL West again, finishing 7 games ahead of the Kansas City Royals. In the 1989 ALCS the Athletics beat the Toronto Blue Jays in five games. Henderson hit 5-for-19 (.263) with one home run and one RBI during the ALCS.

Oakland faced the San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series and swept them in four games, although those games were played over a period of two weeks due to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake before the start of Game 3. Henderson hit 4-for-13 (.308) with two home runs and four RBIs during the series. For the 1989 postseason his batting average was .281 (9-for-32) with three home runs and nine RBIs, and he played center field throughout. This championship proved to be the only one of Henderson&#x27;s MLB career.

====1990 season====
The season again found Oakland winning the AL West, this year with a 103–59 record, finishing ahead of the Chicago White Sox by 9 games. Henderson batted .271 with 20 home runs and 63 RBIs, while appearing in 127 games, including 100 complete games in center field. He missed 27 games between August 20 and September 21, due to torn cartilage in his right knee. Oakland met the AL East winning Red Sox in the 1990 ALCS and swept them in four games, as they had done two years prior. Oakland had Willie McGee in center field in the first two games, with Henderson playing the last two games. During those two games, Henderson batted 1-for-6 (.167) with one RBI. Oakland was unable to repeat as champions, being swept in four games by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 World Series. Henderson batted 3-for-13 (.231) without a home run or RBI. Oakland used McGee in center field in Game 1, with Henderson playing the other three games. Overall for the postseason, Henderson hit .211 (4-for-19) with one RBI and without a home run.

====1991–1993====
During the first half of the season, Henderson hit well, batting .298 with 18 home runs and 50 RBIs, and was selected for the 1991 All-Star Game with over 1.5 million fan votes. He started the All-Star Game for the AL in right field, and was 0-for-2 at the plate before being pinch hit for by Rubén Sierra in the sixth inning. In August, Henderson hit three home runs in a single game, in a losing effort against the Minnesota Twins, with all three coming in consecutive at bats off starting pitcher David West. Henderson&#x27;s average dipped in the second half of the season and he finished the year at .276 with 85 RBIs and a career-high 25 home runs. The Athletics finished with an 84–78 record, 4th place in the AL West.

Henderson had problems with a badly strained right hamstring throughout the season, which limited him to just 20 games played, and caused him to miss 104 consecutive games between May 5 and the start of September. He hit just 9-for-63 (.143) for the season, with 2 RBIs. While Oakland won the AL West (then lost to Toronto in six games in the 1992 ALCS), Henderson was left off the postseason roster due to his injury.

For the season, Henderson appeared in 107 games, including 54 complete games in the outfield and 26 starts as designated hitter (DH). He batted .220 with 20 home runs and 53 RBIs. The Athletics finished the season with a 68–94 record, last place in the AL West. After the season ended, Henderson became a free agent.

Overall, Henderson spent six seasons with Oakland, batting .263 with 104 home runs and 377 RBIs. His time with Oakland included the only All-Star Game and the only World Series championship of his career.

===Kansas City Royals===
Before the start of the season, Henderson was signed as a free agent by the Kansas City Royals, as the club intended to platoon him with Bob Hamelin. For the first month of the season Henderson was the Royals&#x27; regular right fielder, however he only hit 9-for-47 (.191) with 2 home runs and 8 RBIs. Over the coming months he appeared more as DH and was not an everyday player. Through late July he was hitting .247 with 5 home runs at 31 RBIs, having appeared in only 56 of the team&#x27;s 103 games. Shortly after his 36th birthday, Henderson retired on July 29, 1994, which was his last MLB appearance – against the Minnesota Twins, he played the final two innings of the game as a defensive replacement in left field.

During his 14 MLB seasons, Henderson appeared in 1538 games, batting .258 with 197 home runs and 708 RBIs. Defensively, he played 1,388 games in the outfield (1157 in center field), with a .984 fielding percentage.

==Personal life==
Henderson was married twice, and had two sons, one of whom is affected by Angelman syndrome, which Henderson worked to raise research funding for. After retiring as a player, Henderson lived in the Seattle area and remained involved in baseball as an agent, broadcaster, and running fantasy camps. He also co-founded a charity that provides Christmas gifts to children. Henderson owned and operated Dave Henderson&#x27;s Ball Yard in Bellevue, WA during the 1990s.

===Broadcasting===
From 1997 to 2006, Henderson worked as a color commentator during Mariners radio and television broadcasts. He returned to the Mariners&#x27; radio booth during 2011 and 2012 as one of a rotating crew of part-time announcers working with Rick Rizzs who succeeded the deceased Dave Niehaus.

===Death===
Henderson suffered a heart attack and died at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle on December 27, 2015, approximately two months after having undergone a kidney transplant.

<doc id="768209" wikidata="Q3511080" url="?curid=768209" title="King Wen sequence">
<text>The King Wen sequence () is an arrangement of the sixty-four divination figures in the &quot;I Ching&quot; (often translated as the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;). They are called &quot;hexagrams&quot; in English because each figure is composed of six 爻 yáo—broken or unbroken lines, that represent yin or yang respectively.

The King Wen sequence is also known as the &quot;received&quot; or &quot;classical&quot; sequence because it is the oldest surviving arrangement of the hexagrams. Its true age and authorship are unknown. Traditionally, it is said that King Wen of Zhou arranged the hexagrams in this sequence while imprisoned by King Zhou of Shang in the 12th century BC. A different arrangement, the &quot;binary sequence&quot; named in honor of the mythic culture hero Fu Xi, originated in the Song dynasty. It is believed to be the work of scholar Shao Yong (1011–1077 AD). As mirrored by the 先天 Earlier Heaven and 後天 Later Heaven arrangements of the eight trigrams, or ba gua, it was customary to attribute authorship to these legendary figures. Of the two hexagram arrangements, the King Wen sequence is, however, of much greater antiquity than the Fu Xi sequence.

== Structure of the sequence ==
The 64 hexagrams are grouped into 32 pairs. For 28 of the pairs, the second hexagram is created by turning the first upside down (i.e. 180° rotation). The exception to this rule is for the 8 symmetrical hexagrams that are the same after rotation (1 &amp; 2, 27 &amp; 28, 29 &amp; 30, 61 &amp; 62). Partners for these are given by inverting each line: solid becomes broken and broken becomes solid. These are indicated with icons in the table below.

Given the mathematical constraints of these simple rules, the number of lines that change within pair partners will always be even (either 2, 4, or 6). Whereas the number of lines that change between pairs depends on how the pairs are arranged, and the King Wen sequence has notable characteristics in this regard. Of the 64 transitions, exactly 48 of them are even changes (32 within-pairs plus 16 between-pairs) and 16 are odd changes (all between-pairs). This is a precise 3 to 1 ratio of even to odd transitions. Of the odd transitions, 14 are changes of three lines and 2 are changes of one line. Changes of five are absent. Each transition within a pair appears to be the correlating opposite of the other transition within the pair.

=== Dual hexagrams ===
The I Ching book was traditionally split up in two parts with the first part covering the first 30 hexagrams of the King Wen sequence and the second part with the remaining 34. The reason for this was not mentioned in the classic commentaries but was explained in later Yuan dynasty commentaries: 8 hexagrams are the same when turned upside down and the other 56 present a different hexagram if inverted. This allows the hexagrams to be displayed succinctly in two equal columns or rows of 18 unique hexagrams each; half of the 56 invertible hexagrams plus the 8 non-invertible.


== Explanation ==
Over the centuries there were many attempts to explain this sequence. Some basic elements are obvious: each symbol is paired with an &quot;upside-down&quot; neighbor, except for 1, 27, 29, and 61 which are &quot;vertically&quot; symmetrical and paired with &quot;inversed&quot; neighbors.

There have been recent attempts to apply mathematical combinatorics in explaining the logic behind the King Wen sequence, for example Richard S. Cook&#x27;s proposal.

<doc id="768211" wikidata="Q271680" url="?curid=768211" title="Software framework">
<text>In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions. 

Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.

Frameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries:

* &quot;inversion of control&quot;: In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program&#x27;s flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework. This is usually achieved with the Template Method Pattern.
* &quot;default behaviour&quot;: This can be provided with the invariant methods of the Template Method Pattern in an abstract class which is provided by the framework.
* &quot;extensibility&quot;: A user can extend the framework–usually by selective overriding–or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality. This is usually achieved by a hook method in a subclass that overrides a template method in the superclass.
* &quot;non-modifiable framework code&quot;: The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.

== Rationale ==
The designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing overall development time. For example, a team using a web framework to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and state management.

Frameworks often add to the size of programs, a phenomenon termed &quot;code bloat&quot;. Due to customer-demand-driven applications needs, both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product. Further, due to the complexity of their APIs, the intended reduction in overall development time may not be achieved due to the need to spend additional time learning to use the framework; this criticism is clearly valid when a special or new framework is first encountered by development staff. If such a framework is not used in subsequent job taskings, the time invested in learning the framework can cost more than purpose-written code familiar to the project&#x27;s staff; many programmers keep copies of useful boilerplate code for common needs.

However, once a framework is learned, future projects can be faster and easier to complete; the concept of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all solution set, and with familiarity, code production should logically rise. There are no such claims made about the size of the code eventually bundled with the output product, nor its relative efficiency and conciseness. Using any library solution necessarily pulls in extras and unused extraneous assets unless the software is a compiler-object linker making a tight (small, wholly controlled, and specified) executable module.

The issue continues, but a decade-plus of industry experience has shown that the most effective frameworks turn out to be those that evolve from re-factoring the common code of the enterprise, instead of using a generic &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; framework developed by third parties for general purposes. An example of that would be how the user interface in such an application package as an office suite grows to have common look, feel, and data-sharing attributes and methods, as the once disparate bundled applications, grow unified into a suite that is tighter and smaller; the newer/evolved suite can be a product that shares integral utility libraries and user interfaces.

This trend in the controversy brings up an important issue about frameworks. Creating a framework that is elegant, versus one that merely solves a problem, is still rather a craft than a science. &quot;Software elegance&quot; implies clarity, conciseness, and little waste (extra or extraneous functionality, much of which is user-defined). For those frameworks that generate code, for example, &quot;elegance&quot; would imply the creation of code that is clean and comprehensible to a reasonably knowledgeable programmer (and which is therefore readily modifiable), versus one that merely generates correct code. The elegance issue is why relatively few software frameworks have stood the test of time: the best frameworks have been able to evolve gracefully as the underlying technology on which they were built advanced. Even there, having evolved, many such packages will retain legacy capabilities bloating the final software as otherwise replaced methods have been retained in parallel with the newer methods.

== Examples ==

Software frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:

* Artistic drawing, music composition, and mechanical CAD
* Financial modeling applications
* Earth system modeling applications
* Decision support systems
* Media playback and authoring
* Web framework
* Middleware
* Cactus Framework – High performance scientific computing.
* Application framework – General GUI applications.
* Enterprise Architecture framework
* Oracle Application Development Framework
* Laravel (PHP Framework)
* Malware, for example Pipedream
* Php4delphi
* OpenSilver Framework - enables legacy applications based on Microsoft Silverlight, WPF, and LightSwitch to be ported into WebAssembly applications.

== Architecture ==
According to Pree, software frameworks consist of &quot;frozen spots&quot; and &quot;hot spots&quot;. &quot;Frozen spots&quot; define the overall architecture of a software system, that is to say its basic components and the relationships between them. These remain unchanged (frozen) in any instantiation of the application framework. &quot;Hot spots&quot; represent those parts where the programmers using the framework add their own code to add the functionality specific to their own project.

In an object-oriented environment, a framework consists of abstract and concrete classes. Instantiation of such a framework consists of composing and subclassing the existing classes.

The necessary functionality can be implemented by using the Template Method Pattern in which the &quot;frozen spots&quot; are known as invariant methods and the &quot;hot spots&quot; are known as variant or hook methods. The invariant methods in the superclass provide default behaviour while the hook methods in each subclass provide custom behaviour.

When developing a concrete software system with a software framework, developers utilize the hot spots according to the specific needs and requirements of the system. Software frameworks rely on the Hollywood Principle: &quot;Don&#x27;t call us, we&#x27;ll call you.&quot; This means that the user-defined classes (for example, new subclasses) receive messages from the predefined framework classes. Developers usually handle this by implementing superclass abstract methods.

<text>Eckerd Corporation was an American pharmacy retail chain that was headquartered in Largo, Florida, and toward the end of its life, in Warwick, Rhode Island. At its peak, Eckerd was the second-largest pharmacy chain in the United States, with approximately 2,802 stores in 23 states as far west as Arizona.

An independent chain for most of its existence, Eckerd was purchased by JCPenney in 1996. Following years of losses and failed attempts to turn around the company, the chain was divided in 2004, with 1,271 of its stores, and its mail-order business, sold to competitor CVS, and the remainder acquired by Jean Coutu Group through its U.S. division. Jean Coutu sold the chain to Rite Aid in 2007, and its name was phased out soon thereafter and replaced with the Rite Aid name.

== History ==
Eckerd was founded in September 1898 (making it the oldest of the &quot;big four&quot; drugstore chains), by 27-year-old Joseph Milton Eckerd and Z. Tatom in Erie, Pennsylvania. In the company&#x27;s early years, it operated at 1105 State Street in downtown Erie as the Erie Cut-Rate Medicine Store. In 1912, Eckerd and Tatom sold their original store to Eckerd&#x27;s sons and moved to Wilmington, Delaware, establishing a new store. From Delaware, the chain expanded to North Carolina and later Florida. Jack Eckerd, son of the founder, was responsible for the expansion of the company when he acquired three stores in Florida in 1952.

In 1961, Eckerd changed from a proprietorship to a publicly owned company. At the height of Eckerd&#x27;s success, it had over 2,800 stores in more than 20 states, including 1,600 stores with Eckerd Express Photo one-hour photo labs in 19 states, and revenue of $13.1 billion (~$ in ) in fiscal year 2000. Between 1968 and 1985, Eckerd owned Eckerd&#x27;s Apparel and J. Byrons department stores, as well as VideoConcepts, a chain of mall-based electronics shops. J. Byrons and VideoConcepts were sold off in 1985, the latter to Tandy Corporation.

===JCPenney era===
JCPenney and Eckerd agreed to merge in November 1996, and the merger took place in 1997. Penney paid $3.3-billion and assumed $760 million in debt to acquire Eckerd, and combined it with its 800-store Thrift Drug chain. Under the agreement, all of JCPenney&#x27;s Thrift Drug unit of drug stores (comprising Thrift Drug, Kerr Drugs, Fay&#x27;s Drugs, and some Rite Aid stores) were rebranded to the Eckerd name. JCPenney Catalog Centers were added to Eckerd stores. JCPenney also bought more than 500 more stores from four other chains in New York state, Virginia and the Carolinas, such as the 1998 acquisition of the 141-store Genovese chain in the New York metropolitan area. These stores were renamed in 2003.

During this period, Eckerd became the second largest drug store chain in the U.S., with over 2,800 stores stretching from New York and Connecticut to Florida and west to Arizona. One carryover from the Thrift Drug days after the merger took over was the presence of JCPenney Catalog Centers inside certain locations, which enabled Eckerd customers to order merchandise from store catalogs and pick it up at an Eckerd location. As technology, such as ordering over the Internet, began to gain traction, Eckerd fell behind by failing to update its IT networks. Over the next seven years JCPenney came to see Eckerd as a distraction which would cost too much to continue fixing (as they were focused on their department stores), and in March 2004 it formally declared that it would carry Eckerd on its books as a discontinued asset. JCPenney took a $1.3-billion charge against earnings in connection with selling the drugstore chain, which had accounted for 45 percent of its annual revenues.

=== Sale to CVS and Jean Coutu ===
In July 2004, JCPenney sold the Eckerd chain to CVS Corporation and Jean Coutu Group for a total of $4.5 billion (~$ in ). CVS acquired 1,271 Eckerd stores, and support facilities, in Florida, Texas, and other Southern states, as well as Eckerd&#x27;s pharmacy benefits management and mail order businesses, for $2.15 billion. Jean Coutu Group acquired the remaining 1,540 stores, and support facilities, in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic (essentially everything from Georgia northward) for $2.375 billion.
The locations acquired by CVS were converted to CVS Pharmacies in late 2004 and 2005, eliminating the Eckerd name from markets such as Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which were historically the chain&#x27;s strongholds. Even a few brand-new locations in Florida, Texas and Arizona were transformed into CVS almost as quickly as they were built as Eckerd stores. The CVS purchase also included the Eckerd stores located in Colorado; however, CVS opted to close these stores. As a condition of the sale, CVS accepted JCPenney&#x27;s store credit card until July 2014.

==== Brooks Eckerd ====
Jean Coutu merged the Eckerd stores it acquired with its existing American pharmacy, Brooks. The merged company was based at Brooks&#x27; corporate headquarters in Warwick, Rhode Island. The Eckerd and Brooks chains shared many of the same corporate functions. Jean Coutu operated the stores it purchased under the slightly modified &quot;Eckerd Pharmacy&quot; name and logo, featuring a red Eckerd capsule in an attempt to unify the Eckerd and Brooks chains.

===Acquisition by Rite Aid===

On August 23, 2006, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; announced that Rite Aid would acquire 1,858 Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy stores from Jean Coutu for US$3.4 billion (~$ in ). The deal closed on June 4, 2007. Rite Aid announced that the two chains would be converted to the Rite Aid name, retiring the 109-year-old Eckerd banner. The merger was signed and completed as of June 4, 2007; all remaining Eckerd stores converted to Rite Aid by the end of September 2007.

The conversion process consisted of two steps: new computer systems, and a full PPR (paint, powder, re-set) which consisted of new signage and a new design scheme. Many of the stores received new paint on their exteriors, making them look more like brick than the white stucco design of most Eckerd locations. Eckerd&#x27;s remaining JCPenney Catalog Centers were closed in favor of Rite Aid choosing to accept JCPenney charge cards chainwide including stores that were not former Eckerd locations .

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amid several opioid lawsuits and declining sales. Eckerd Corporation, along with the former U.S. subsidiary of Jean Coutu, had remained active in-name-only subsidiaries of Rite Aid, as shown in the company&#x27;s bankruptcy filings.
