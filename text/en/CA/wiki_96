<text>Rosemère () is an affluent suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada on the north shore of the Rivière des Mille Îles in the Thérèse-De Blainville Regional County Municipality. The town is noted for its green look, due to the high density of trees. Some wooded areas in the town have been left intact as the town has grown around them. Homes are mostly upscale, varying from renovated cottages to unique character homes. It is almost entirely residential, with no significant industries. Boulevard Curé-Labelle, the town&#x27;s main commercial artery, is lined up by suburban shops and shopping malls, the largest of which is Place Rosemère.

Its most famous resident is likely Alexandre Bilodeau, who became the first Canadian athlete to win an Olympic gold medal on Canadian soil. He won the men&#x27;s moguls event at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rosemère had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==History==
The area that would become Rosemère was first settled in 1714, with the establishment of the Mille-Îles Seigneury. By 1780, the seigneury was well established, with large tracts of land under cultivation. Rosemère was named by J.P. Withers, of the Canadian Pacific Railway, who moved to the area in 1880. At first he called his new home &quot;Rose&quot;, after the many wild roses growing there. Later he added &quot;mere&quot;, an old English word for a lake. The Rivière des Mille Îles is wide and has the appearance of a lake at this location, so the English meaning would be &quot;lake of roses&quot;. After the town&#x27;s incorporation, documents were forwarded to Quebec City, and an accent was added to the middle &#x27;e&#x27;, according to statements by residents. In French, the name does not mean &quot;Mother of Roses&quot;, which would be said &quot;Mère des Roses&quot; in French. The town&#x27;s name has no sensible meaning in French, though in typical Canadian fashion, the name has become bilingual.

In the first half of the last century, Rosemère had several natural sandy beaches on the Rivière des Mille Îles and many cottages along the shoreline that were only used during the summer. These beaches fell into disuse in the early 1960s because of pollution. A majority of the year-round residents were francophone and many of the summer-only residents were anglophone. After World War II, Rosemère was transformed into a bedroom community of Montreal with the construction of homes in farmland and forested areas northwest of Grande Côte. By 1964, 65% of Rosemère&#x27;s residents were anglophone. While the French and English residents of Rosemère have always enjoyed the ambiance of the area in harmony, the English population has declined over the years to today&#x27;s 16% (2001 Canadian Census), but has since climbed to 19.89% (2006 Canadian Census).

The French- and English-speaking communities of Rosemère have cohabitated for a long time, each of them leaving its own mark and institutions. In 1992, a public consultation process confirmed the desire of residents to preserve the Town of Rosemère&#x27;s bilingual status.

==Education==
The Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles (CSSMI) operates French-language schools in the city.
*École secondaire Hubert-Maisonneuve (lower secondary)
*École primaire Alpha
*École primaire Val-des-Ormes
Some students are zoned to École primaire du Ruisselet in Lorraine and École primaire de Fontainebleau in Blainville. Upper secondary students are zoned to École Polyvalente Sainte-Thérèse in Sainte-Thérèse or to École secondaire Rive-Nord in Bois-des-Filion.

Furthermore, the administration building for the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board which operates English-language schools found in the Laval, Laurentides and Lanaudière regions is located in Rosemère. It neighbours one of its secondary schools, Rosemère High School which also houses the English school board&#x27;s educational and complementary services. The board also operates McCaig Elementary School, which is located in very close proximity to the high school, as it is located on the same street. McCaig and Rosemère High serve all areas of the municipality.

The francophone private school Académie Sainte-Thérèse has a campus in Rosemère. Externat Sacré-Cœur is also in the town.

<text>Faya-Largeau (also known as Faya, or ) is the largest city in northern Chad and was the capital of the region of Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti. It is now in the Borkou Region, which was formed in 2008 from the Borkou Department of the former Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region.

==History==
Originally called &quot;Faya&quot;, the town was renamed &quot;Largeau&quot; after French Colonel Victor Emmanuel Largeau; upon Chadian independence from France, it assumed the name &quot;Faya-Largeau&quot;. The town was captured by Libya when Libya annexed the Aouzou Strip in 1975, but was retaken by Hissène Habré&#x27;s forces in 1980. Libya recaptured Faya-Largeau in 1983, but retreated in 1987 during the so-called Toyota War.

==Economy==
Due to the considerable underground water supply in the town, the main economic activities are agriculture and natron mining. The town is serviced by Faya-Largeau Airport with a paved runway, used almost exclusively by military airplanes.

==Demographics==
==Climate==
Faya-Largeau has a hot desert climate typical of the Borkou Region lying on the heart of the Sahara Desert. Average maximum temperatures in Faya-Largeau are consistently over from April to September, reaching a maximum of in June. The coolest months are December and January with an average maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation averages only and generally only occurs from June to September, although some years have no rainfall at all. The sunshine duration is one of the highest found in the world with some 3,800 hours of bright sunshine annually, and every month receives an average sunshine duration above 290 hours.

<doc id="791707" wikidata="Q4555041" url="?curid=791707" title="1860 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1860 Republican National Convention was a presidential nominating convention that met May 16–18 in Chicago, Illinois. It was held to nominate the Republican Party&#x27;s candidates for president and vice president in the 1860 election. The convention selected former representative Abraham Lincoln of Illinois for president and Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine for vice president.

Entering the 1860 convention, Senator William H. Seward of New York was generally regarded as the front-runner, but Lincoln, Governor Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, former representative Edward Bates of Missouri, and Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania all commanded support from a significant share of delegates. Seward led on the first ballot but fell short of a majority, while Lincoln finished in a strong second place. Cameron&#x27;s delegates shifted to Lincoln on the second ballot, leaving Lincoln essentially tied with Seward. Lincoln clinched the nomination on the third ballot after consolidating support from more delegates who had backed candidates other than Seward.

Hamlin was nominated on the second vice presidential ballot, defeating Cassius Clay of Kentucky and several other candidates.

The ticket of Lincoln and Hamlin went on to win the 1860 general election. After taking office in 1861, Lincoln appointed all four of his major opponents to his cabinet: Seward for secretary of state, Chase for secretary of the treasury (and later for chief justice), Bates for attorney general, and Cameron for secretary of war.

==History==

===Background===
By 1860 the dissolution of the Whig Party in America had become an accomplished fact, with establishment Whig politicians, former Free Soilers, and a certain number of anti-Catholic populists from the Know Nothing movement flocking to the banner of the fledgling anti-slavery Republican Party. While 1856 Republican presidential nominee John C. Frémont had met with failure, party gains were made throughout the Northern United States as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.

Horace Greeley, Ebenezer R. Hoar, and Edwin D. Morgan were interested in holding the 1860 convention in a border state. Party leaders sought to hold their 1860 nominating convention in the burgeoning Middle Western trade center of Chicago, then a city of some 110,000 people. The city had no sufficiently large meeting hall, so an appropriation was made for a temporary wood-frame assembly hallknown as the &quot;Wigwam&quot;to seat ten thousand delegates, guests, and observers. The rapidly designed and constructed building proved well fit for the purpose, featuring excellent lines of sight and stellar acoustics, allowing even an ordinary speaker to be heard throughout the room.

The Convention commanded the interest and attention of a multitude of curious citizens who crowded the &quot;Wigwam&quot; to the rafters. Delegations were seated by state and the gathering was virtually devoid of Southern participation, with no delegations attending from the slave states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida.

Delegation voting strength was loosely based upon the size of each state&#x27;s congressional delegation, subject to some modification by the Credentials Committee, with the Northeastern delegations of New York (70), Pennsylvania (54), Massachusetts (26), and New Jersey (14) constituting the largest regional block, surpassing the Midwestern states of Ohio (46), Indiana (26), Illinois (22), and Iowa (8). Some 86 votes were apportioned to the six states of New England. Slave and border states with substantial delegations under the rules (but with small actual party organizations) included Kentucky (23), Virginia (23), and Missouri (18). The total of all credentialed delegate votes was 466.

===Daily affairs===

With the convention called to order on May 16, former U.S. Representative David Wilmot of Pennsylvania was elected temporary chairman of the gathering. He had been the author in 1848 of the Wilmot Proviso which would have banned slavery from new states incorporated into the Union. Upon his election, Wilmot delivered the keynote speech to the convention, in which he declared that:

A great sectional and aristocratic party, or interest, has for years dominated with a high hand over the political affairs of this country. That interest has wrested, and is now wresting, all the great powers of this government to the one object of the extension and nationalization of slavery. It is our purpose, gentlemen, it is the mission of the Republican Party and the basis of its organization, to resist this policy of a sectional interest... It is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of the Union floats.

Organizational tasks filled the rest of the first day&#x27;s activities, including the appointment of a Credentials Committee and a Resolutions Committee. There were no contested seats although a delegation purporting to represent the state of Texas was ruled ineligible by the Credentials Committee. A Platform Committee was also named, including one delegate from every state and territory in attendance. This committee began its work at once and completed its task with a report on the evening of the second day, May 17.

===Platform===
The platform was drawn up by the Platform Committee chaired by Judge William Jessup of Pennsylvania. The reading of the platform was received with stormy applause and an immediate move followed to adopt the document unanimously and without amendments. US Representative Joshua Reed Giddings of Ohio proposed an amendment to insert the famous language from the Declaration of Independence that &quot;All men are created equal; and they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights...&quot; This amendment was initially rejected by the convention, prompting Giddings to walk out. The matter was hastily reconsidered by the convention, and with the addition of the amendment the disgruntled Mr. Giddings returned to his seat, crisis resolved.

The 1860 Republican platform consisted of 17 declarations of principle, of which 10 dealt directly with the issues of &quot;free soil&quot;, slavery, the Fugitive Slave Act, and the preservation of the Union, while the remaining 7 dealt with other issues.

Clauses 12 through 16 of the platform called for a protective tariff, enactment of the Homestead Act, maintaining the current naturalization laws and full rights to all &quot;native or naturalized&quot; citizens, internal improvements, and the construction of a Pacific railroad.

In addition to the preservation of the Union, all five of these additional promises were enacted by the Thirty-seventh Congress and implemented by Abraham Lincoln or the presidents who immediately succeeded him.

==Presidential nomination==
===Presidential candidates===


The Republican National Convention met in mid-May 1860, after the Democrats had been forced to adjourn their convention in Charleston, South Carolina. With the Democrats in disarray and a sweep of the Northern states possible, the Republicans felt confident going into their convention in Chicago. William H. Seward from New York was considered the front-runner, followed Salmon P. Chase from Ohio, and Missouri&#x27;s Edward Bates. Abraham Lincoln from Illinois, was lesser known, and was not considered to have a good chance against Seward. Seward had been governor and senator of New York, was from firm Whig backgrounds, and was a very able politician. Also running were John C. Frémont, William L. Dayton, Cassius M. Clay, and Benjamin Wade, who might be able to win if the convention deadlocked.

As the convention developed, however, it was revealed that frontrunners Seward, Chase, and Bates had each alienated factions of the Republican Party. Seward had been painted as a radical, and his speeches on slavery predicted inevitable conflict, which spooked moderate delegates. He also was firmly opposed to nativism, which further weakened his position. He had also been abandoned by his longtime friend and political ally Horace Greeley, publisher of the influential &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;.

Chase, a former Democrat, had alienated many of the former Whigs by his coalition with the Democrats in the late 1840s. He had also opposed tariffs demanded by Pennsylvania, and even had opposition from his own delegation from Ohio. However, Chase&#x27;s firm antislavery stance made him popular with the radical Republicans. But what he had in policy he lacked in charisma and political acumen.

Bates&#x27; candidacy was pushed by Francis Preston Blair and Francis Preston Blair Jr. despite Bates not being a member of the party. They had the Republican parties of Missouri and Maryland send delegations pledged to Bates. Greeley and Schuyler Colfax were interested in his candidacy, but he failed to receive a large amount of support from northern or border state delegates. The conservative Bates was an unlikely candidate. Bates outlined his positions on the extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and Southern conservatives, while German Americans in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the Know Nothings.

Into this mix came Lincoln. Lincoln was not unknown; he had gained prominence in the Lincoln–Douglas debates, and had served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois. He had been quietly eyeing a run since the Lincoln–Douglas debates in 1858, ensuring that the debates were widely published, and that a biography of himself was published. He gained great notability with his February 1860 Cooper Union speech, which may have ensured him the nomination. At that time he had not yet announced his intentions to run, but it was a superb speech. Delivered in Seward&#x27;s home state, and attended by Greeley, Lincoln used the speech to show that the Republican party was a party of moderates, not crazed fanatics as the South and Democrats claimed. Afterwards, Lincoln was in much demand for speaking engagements. As the convention approached, Lincoln did not campaign very actively, as the &quot;office was expected to seek the man&quot;. So it did at the Illinois state convention in downstate Decatur, a week before the national convention. Young politician Richard Oglesby had secretly found several fence rails from the Hanks-Lincoln farm that Lincoln may have split as a youngster, and paraded them into the convention with a banner that proclaimed Lincoln to be &quot;The Rail Candidate&quot; for president. Lincoln received a thunderous ovation, surpassing the expectations of him and his political allies.

Even with such support from his home state, Lincoln faced a difficult task if he was to win the nomination. He set about ensuring that he was the second choice of most delegates, realizing that the first round of voting at the convention was unlikely to produce a clear winner. He engineered that the convention would happen in Chicago, which would be inherently friendly to the Illinois-based Lincoln. He also made sure that the Illinois delegation would vote as a bloc for him. Lincoln did not attend the convention in person, and left the task of delegate wrangling to his friends Leonard Swett, Ward Hill Lamon, and David Davis. Lincoln&#x27;s team even printed counterfeit convention tickets, which they handed out to his supporters.

During the night of May 17–18, they worked frantically to win anti-Seward delegates for Lincoln. They showed that Lincoln already had the most support after Seward, which persuaded some. They also made a deal with Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, who recognized that he had no chance of winning the nomination himself. Cameron controlled the Pennsylvania delegation, and he offered to trade his support for the promise of a cabinet position for himself and control of Federal patronage in Pennsylvania. Lincoln did not want to make any such deal; from Springfield, he telegraphed to Davis &quot;&quot;. Despite this restriction, Davis reached an understanding with Cameron, which eventually led to Cameron&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of War.

The next day (May 18), when voting for the nomination began, Seward led on the first ballot with Lincoln a distant second. But on the second ballot, the Pennsylvania delegation switched to Lincoln, as well as some other delegates, putting him in a near-tie with Seward. Lincoln&#x27;s combination of a moderate stance on slavery, long support for economic issues, his western origins, and strong oratory proved to be exactly what the delegates wanted in a president. On the third ballot on May 18, Lincoln secured the nomination overwhelmingly. Senator Hannibal Hamlin from Maine was nominated for vice-president, defeating Cassius M. Clay. Hamlin was surprised by his nomination, saying he was &quot;astonished&quot; and that he &quot;neither expected nor desired it.&quot;

Among other accounts, an article, entitled &quot;The Four Votes&quot;, published in the May 19, 1860, edition of the &quot;Chicago Press and Tribune&quot; attests that after seeing how close Lincoln was to the 234 votes needed, Robert K. Enos, a member of the Ohio delegation, was responsible for getting three fellow Ohio delegates to announce after the close of the third ballot that they were shifting their four votes to Lincoln, giving him sufficient votes to win the nomination. This triggered an avalanche towards Lincoln on the fourth ballot, with a final count of 350 votes for Lincoln out of 466 cast.

<text>Clatsop Community College (CCC) is a public community college with facilities in Astoria and Seaside, Oregon. The college&#x27;s service area includes Clatsop County, portions of Columbia and Tillamook counties and Pacific and Wahkiakum counties in Washington state.

==History==
CCC was established under the direction of the Astoria Board of Education in 1958 and constitutes Oregon&#x27;s first community college. The original curriculum included two years of classes that could be transferred and two year sequences in Electronics, Business, Automotive and Building Construction. In 1962, Clatsop County residents voted to form a county-wide education district and separate the college from the school district. Renovation of the former Astoria High School began in June 1962 and this facility became the home of CCC.

In October 2008, the college broke ground on the Jerome Campus Redevelopment project. This project, now complete, resulted in the renovation of Towler Hall (the former Astoria High School), renovation of Patriot Hall and the construction of Columbia Hall. .

==Accreditation==
Clatsop Community College is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU).

==Facilities==
CCC&#x27;s main campus in Astoria is located on a hillside overlooking the Columbia River. The campus includes the Royal Nebeker Art Center Gallery that hosts approximately six exhibits annually. In addition, the college operates a second campus with maritime, fire and technical programs (MERTS), as well as an Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Technology Center (IMTC). The MERTS campus is located east of Astoria and Tongue Point on the Columbia River.

As part of its maritime science program, CCC maintains and operates the training vessel Forerunner.

Small business and economic development services, along with ESL, GED, and vocational classes, are conducted at the South County Center in Seaside.

<text>In pharmacology, partial agonists are drugs that bind to and activate a given receptor, but have only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. They may also be considered ligands which display both agonistic and antagonistic effects—when both a full agonist and partial agonist are present, the partial agonist actually acts as a competitive antagonist, competing with the full agonist for receptor occupancy and producing a net decrease in the receptor activation observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, partial agonists can be used to activate receptors to give a desired submaximal response when inadequate amounts of the endogenous ligand are present, or they can reduce the overstimulation of receptors when excess amounts of the endogenous ligand are present.

Some currently common drugs that have been classed as partial agonists at particular receptors include buspirone, aripiprazole, buprenorphine, nalmefene and norclozapine. Examples of ligands activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as partial agonists are honokiol and falcarindiol. Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a partial agonist at CB2 receptors and this activity might be implicated in ∆9-THCV-mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a partial agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with the former being responsible for its psychoactive effects.

<doc id="791712" wikidata="Q241006" url="?curid=791712" title="Desmopressin">
<text>Desmopressin, sold under the trade name DDAVP among others, is a medication used to treat diabetes insipidus, bedwetting, hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, and high blood urea levels. In hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease, it should only be used for mild to moderate cases. It may be given in the nose, by injection into a vein, by mouth, or under the tongue.
Common side effects include headaches, diarrhea, and low blood sodium. The low blood sodium that results may cause seizures. It should not be used in people with significant kidney problems or low blood sodium. It appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. It is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, the hormone that plays roles in the control of the body&#x27;s osmotic balance, blood pressure regulation, kidney function, and reduction of urine production.
Desmopressin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
===Bed wetting ===
Desmopressin is used to treat nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). It is usually prescribed in the form of desmopressin acetate, by mouth. Children taking DDAVP have 2.2 fewer wet nights per week and are 4.5 times more likely to sleep without disruption compared with placebo.

===Nocturia===
In 2017, the FDA approved Desmopressin has some benefit for adults who have problems with nocturia (having a need to wake up at night for urination).

===Bleeding disorders===
Desmopressin (DDAVP) is usually the first line treatment for mild to moderate type 1 von Willebrand disease. It is not recommended in severe disease or in those with abnormal factor VIII. Usefulness in type 2A, 2M, or 2N von Willebrand disease is variable. Generally not recommended in 2B and type 3 von Willebrand disease.

Desmopressin is only recommended in mild hemophilia A. It may be used both for bleeding due to trauma or to try to prevent bleeding due to surgery. It is not effective in the treatment of hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) or severe hemophilia A. May also be used in uremia induced bleeding.

===Diabetes insipidus===
Desmopressin is used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus (DI) as a replacement for endogenous antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that is in insufficient quantity due to decreased or non-existent secretion or production of ADH by the posterior pituitary or hypothalamus, respectively. It is also used in the diagnostic workup for diabetes insipidus, in order to distinguish central from DI due to the kidneys. Desmopressin is not effective at treating nephrogenic DI, thus a positive response is generally indicative of central DI.

==Side effects==
* headaches
* facial flushing
* nausea
* hyponatremia
* seizures

US drug regulators added warning to the nasal sprays after two people died and fifty-nine other people had seizures. This occurred due to hyponatremia, a deficit of the body&#x27;s sodium levels, and the nasal spray is no longer approved for use in children in the United States. However, US drug regulators have said that desmopressin tablets can still be considered safe for treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children as long as the person is otherwise healthy.

Patients must stop taking desmopressin if they develop severe vomiting and diarrhea, fever, the flu, or severe cold. Patients should also be very cautious about taking desmopressin during hot weather conditions or following strenuous exercise, as these conditions can place stress on the body&#x27;s electrolyte and water balance.

A body needs to maintain a balance of water and sodium. If sodium levels become too low (hyponatremia) – either as a result of increased water take-up or reduced salt levels – a person may have seizures and, in extreme cases, may die.

==Mechanism of action==
Desmopressin works by limiting the amount of water that is eliminated in the urine; that is, it is an antidiuretic. It works at the level of the renal collecting duct by binding to V2 receptors, which signal for the translocation of aquaporin channels via cytosolic vesicles to the apical membrane of the collecting duct. The presence of these aquaporin channels in the distal nephron causes increasing water reabsorption from the urine, which becomes passively re-distributed from the nephron to systemic circulation by way of basolateral membrane channels. Desmopressin also stimulates release of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells by acting on the V2 receptor. It also increases endogenous levels of factor VIII, making it useful in the treatment of hemophilia A.

Desmopressin is degraded more slowly than recombinant vasopressin, and requires less frequent administration. In addition, it has little effect on blood pressure, while vasopressin may cause arterial hypertension. Vasopressin stimulates the release of ACTH, which indirectly increases responsiveness of alpha-1 receptor in blood vessel smooth muscle, increasing vessel tone and blood pressure. Several studies have shown that Desmopressin does not stimulate ACTH release (except in Cushing&#x27;s Disease), and therefore does not directly raise blood pressure, however, one study showed that it stimulates ACTH release in over 50% of healthy subjects. Additionally, desmopressin is able to enhance ACTH and cortisol release in normal subjects following oCRH administration, but not in patients with anorexia nervosa.

==Chemistry==
Desmopressin (&quot;1-deamino-8--arginine vasopressin&quot;) is a synthetic form of the normal human hormone arginine vasopressin (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH), a peptide containing nine amino acids.

Compared to vasopressin, desmopressin&#x27;s first amino acid has been deaminated, and the arginine at the eighth position is in the &quot;dextro&quot; rather than the &quot;levo&quot; form (see stereochemistry).

<text>Mao () is a city in Chad, the capital of the Kanem Region and of the department also named Kanem. It is the 16th most populous city in Chad, and is located north-northeast of N&#x27;Djamena.

On the border of the Sahara, Mao&#x27;s geography is marked by sand dunes and sparse vegetation. A large majority of Mao&#x27;s residents are Muslim. There are two Christian churches (one Catholic and one Protestant) in Mao.

As in other Chadian regions, Mao is ruled by both a traditional Sultan and by central government officials. The Sultan of Kanem, who resides in Mao, is the traditional chief of the Kanembou people. Moves toward decentralisation have been stymied by the complex and sometimes tense relationships between traditional rulers in Chad and national authorities.

== History ==
Mao was created in 1898 by Sultan Ali, brother of Sultan Djourab who was assassinated by the Fezzans and other accomplices. Since 1900, Mao has been the effective administrative center of the north.

On 18 July 2010, the Sultan of Kanem, Alifa Ali Zezerti, died in hospital in N&#x27;Djamena aged 83, from complications from a heart attack. He was the 39th ruler of the Kanem dynasty, and had reigned since 1947. He was buried in Mao. His predecessor, Sultan Zezerti, had died on 26 September 1947, having ruled since 1925. His son was elected as Sultan in a by-election without competition.

In October 2013, riots broke out in Mao&#x27;s main market directed against the administration of Idriss Déby after the shooting dead of a civilian by an officer close to Déby.

On 30 September 2015, around 8 pm, a major fire burned through the main market of Mao. The origin could not be determined. No deaths were reported.

On 12 May 2016, at 5 am, a large fire spread throughout the main market of Mao, the second in under two years. The fire started in a nearby fuel depot. No human casualties were reported.

== Transport ==
The area is very isolated and land travel is difficult (along sand tracks that can only be negotiated using four-by-four vehicles or camels). The town has a small airport, Mao Airport , with a paved runway.

== Economy ==
On Wednesdays, which is &quot;Grand Market Day&quot;, fresh produce is sold such as onion, garlic, dates, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and sometimes aubergines, which were introduced in 2009 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Fruits are also sold, especially bananas and sometimes mangoes, papayas and guavas. Millet is also available in both white and red types.

==Demographics==
The population for 1993 and 2009 corresponds to the official census. For 2019 it was estimated based on population growth in the Kanem area.

<doc id="791733" wikidata="Q1115006" url="?curid=791733" title="Johannine Comma">
<text>The Johannine Comma () is an interpolated phrase (comma) in verses of the First Epistle of John.
The text (with the comma in italics and enclosed by brackets) in the King James Version of the Bible reads:
In the Greek Textus Receptus (TR), the verse reads thus:ὅτι τρεῖς εἰσιν οἱ μαρτυροῦντες εν τῷ οὐρανῷ, ὁ πατήρ, ὁ λόγος, καὶ τὸ Ἅγιον Πνεῦμα· καὶ οὗτοι οἱ τρεῖς ἕν εἰσι.It became a touchpoint for the Christian theological debate over the doctrine of the Trinity from the early church councils to the Catholic and Protestant disputes in the early modern period.

It may first be noted that the words &quot;in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one&quot; (KJV) found in older translations at 1 John 5:7 are thought by some to be spurious additions to the original text. A footnote in the Jerusalem Bible, a Catholic translation, says that these words are &quot;not in any of the early Greek MSS [manuscripts], or any of the early translations, or in the best MSS of the Vulg[ate] itself.&quot; In &quot;A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament&quot;, Bruce Metzger (1975, pp. 716–718) traces in detail the history of the passage, asserting its first mention in the 4th-century treatise &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot;, and that it appears in Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts beginning in the 6th century. Modern translations as a whole (both Catholic and Protestant, such as the Revised Standard Version, New English Bible, and New American Bible) do not include them in the main body of the text due to their ostensibly spurious nature.
The comma is mainly only attested in the Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, being absent from the vast majority of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, the earliest Greek manuscript being 14th century. It is also totally absent in the Geʽez, Coptic, Syriac, Georgian, Arabic and from the early pre-12th century Armenian witnesses to the New Testament. Despite its absence from these manuscripts, it was contained in many printed editions of the New Testament in the past, including the Complutensian Polyglot (1517ad), the different editions of the Textus Receptus (1516-1894ad), the London Polyglot (1655) and the Patriarchal text (1904ad). And it is contained in many Reformation-era vernacular translations of the Bible due to the inclusion of the verse within the Textus Receptus. In spite of its late date, members of the King James Only movement and those who advocate for the superiority for the Textus Receptus have argued for its authenticity.

The Comma Johanneum is among the most noteworthy variants found within the Textus Receptus in addition to the confession of the Ethiopian eunuch, the long ending of Mark, the &quot;Pericope Adulterae&quot;, the reading &quot;God&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16 and the &quot;Book of Life&quot; in Book of Revelation 22:19.

==Text==
The &quot;Johannine Comma&quot; is a found in 1 John 5:7–8.

Erasmus omitted the text of the Johannine Comma from his first and second editions of the Greek-Latin New Testament (the ) because it was not in his Greek manuscripts. He added the text to his in 1522 after being accused of reviving Arianism and after he was informed of a Greek manuscript that contained the verse, although he expressed doubt as to its authenticity in his &quot;Annotations&quot;.

Many subsequent early printed editions of the Bible include it, such as the Coverdale Bible (1535), the Geneva Bible (1560), the Douay-Rheims Bible (1610), and the King James Bible (1611). Later editions based on the , such as Robert Young&#x27;s &quot;Literal Translation&quot; (1862) and the New King James Version (1979), include the verse. In the 1500s it was not always included in Latin New Testament editions, though it was in the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate (1592). However, Martin Luther did not include it in his Luther Bible.

The text (with the Comma in brackets and italicised) in the King James Bible reads:
The text (with the Comma in brackets and italicised) in the Latin of the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate reads:
The text (with the Comma in brackets and italicised) in the Greek of the reads:
There are several variant versions of the Latin and Greek texts.

English translations based on a modern critical text have omitted the comma from the main text since the English Revised Version (1881), including the New American Standard Bible (NASB), English Standard Version (ESV), and New Revised Standard Version (NRSV).

==Origin==
Several early sources that might be expected to include the Comma Johanneum in fact omit it. For example, Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s () quotation of 1 John 5:8 does not include the Comma.

Among the earliest possible references to the Comma appears by the 3rd-century Church Father Cyprian (died 258), who in &quot;Unity of the Church 1.6&quot; quoted John 10:30: &quot;Again it is written of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, &#x27;And these three are one. However, some believe that he was giving an interpretation of the three elements mentioned in the uncontested part of the verse.

The first undisputed work to quote the Comma Johanneum as an actual part of the Epistle&#x27;s text appears to be the 4th-century Latin homily , probably written by Priscillian of Ávila (died 385), or his close follower Bishop Instantius.

==Manuscripts==

The Comma is not in two of the oldest extant Vulgate manuscripts, Codex Fuldensis and the Codex Amiatinus, although it is referenced in the &quot;Prologue to the Canonical Epistles&quot; of Fuldensis, and appears in Old Latin manuscripts of similar antiquity.
The earliest extant Latin manuscripts supporting the Comma are dated from the 5th to 7th century. The Freisinger fragment, León palimpsest, besides the younger Codex Speculum, New Testament quotations extant in an 8th- or 9th-century manuscript.

The comma does not appear in the older Greek manuscripts. Nestle-Aland is aware of eight Greek manuscripts that contain the Comma. The date of the addition is late, probably dating to the time of Erasmus. In one manuscript, back-translated into Greek from the Vulgate, the phrase &quot;and these three are one&quot; is absent.

Both (NA27) and the United Bible Societies (UBS4) provide three variants. The numbers here follow UBS4, which rates its preference for the first variant as { A }, meaning &quot;virtually certain&quot; to reflect the original text. The second variant is a longer Greek version found in the original text of five manuscripts and the margins of five others. All of the other 500 plus Greek manuscripts that contain 1 John support the first variant. The third variant is found only in Latin manuscripts and patristic works. The Latin variant is considered a trinitarian gloss, explaining or paralleled by the second Greek variant.

#The Comma in Greek. All non-lectionary evidence cited: Minuscules 61 (Codex Montfortianus, ), 629 (Codex Ottobonianus, 14th/15th century), 918 (Codex Escurialensis, Σ. I. 5, 16th century), 2318 (18th century) and 2473 (17th century). It is also found in the Complutensian Polyglot (1520) in both Greek and Latin. Its first full appearance in Greek is from the Greek version of the Acts of the Lateran Council in 1215. Although it later appears in the writings of Emmanuel Calecas (died 1410), Joseph Bryennius (1350 – 1431/38) and in the Orthodox Confession of Moglas (1643). There are no full Patristic Greek references to the comma, however, F.H.A. Scrivener mentions two possible allusions in Greek to the comma in the 4th or 5th century from the Synopsis of Holy Scripture and the Disputation with Arius from Pseudo-Athanasius.

[or ] [or: ] [... &quot;giving evidence on earth, spirit, water and blood, and these three are one in Christ Jesus. 8 And the three, which give evidence in heaven, are father word and spirit.&quot;] All evidence from Fathers cited: Clementine edition of Vulgate translation; Pseudo-Augustine&#x27;s (V), also (these three with some variation) Cyprian (3rd century), Priscillian (died 385) , Expositio Fidei (4th century), Contra-Varimadum (439-484), Eugenius of Carthage (5th century), Council of Carthage (483), Pseudo-Jerome (5th century) &quot;Prologue to the Catholic Epistles,&quot; Fulgentius of Ruspe (died 527) , Cassiodorus (6th century) , Donation of Constantine (8th century). It is also found in the quotations of multiple later medieval writers, including: Peter Abelard (12th century), Peter Lombard (12th century), Bernard of Clairvaux (12th century), Thomas Aquinas (13th century) and William of Ockham (14th century).
#The Comma in other languages: According to Scrivener, the Johannine Comma is found in a few late Slavonic manuscripts, and also in the margin of the Moscow edition of 1663, published under Alexis of Russia. Due to Latin influence, the Johannine Comma also found its way into the Armenian language after the 12th century under King Haithom. One of the eighteen MSS. used by Zohrab to publish the Armenian Bible had the Comma,and it was quoted in the 13th century in the Armenian synod of Sis alongside being found in Uscan&#x27;s Armenian translation of the Bible of the 17th century. The Syriac writer Jacob of Edessa (640–708) has been proposed to have referenced the Comma by making a trinitarian reference alongside the water, blood, and Spirit. However, his statements are also seen as possibly referring to the Latin work &quot;Against Varimadus&quot;, especially with Jacob&#x27;s mention that the Trinity exists &quot;within us&quot;. This suggests Jacob&#x27;s reference might be to this Latin text rather than a quotation of 1 John 5:7. In Minuscule 460, (a trilingual manuscript) In folio 115v, the Arabic Column reads لأرض (latinized: al-ardh, lit. on earth) in v. 8, but omits the Heavenly Witnesses. &quot;On earth&quot; being part of the spurious verse&#x27;s addition. The 14th century German Augsburger Bible mentions the heavenly witnesses after the earthly witnesses. The addition is also in Cod. Sang. 28, an Old French manuscript of the 13th century. 

The appearance of the Comma in the manuscript evidence is represented in the following tables:



=== Doubtful proposed manuscript attestation ===
The Codex Vaticanus in some places contains umlauts to indicate knowledge of variants. Although there has been some debate on the age of these umlauts and if they were added at a later date, according to a paper made by Philip B. Payne, the ink seems to match that of the original scribe. The Codex Vaticanus contains these dots around 1 John 5:7, which is why some have assumed it to be a reference to the Johannine Comma. However, according to McDonald, G. R, it is far more likely that the scribe had encountered other variants in the verse than the Johannine comma, which is not attested in any Greek manuscript until the 14th century.

No extant Syriac manuscripts contain the Johannine Comma, nevertheless some past advocates of the inclusion of the Johannine comma such as Thomas Burgess (1756-1837) have proposed that the inclusion of the conjuctive participle &quot;and&quot; within the text of 1 John 5:7 in some Syriac manuscripts is an indication of its past inclusion within the Syriac textual tradition.

It is known that Erasmus was aware of a codex from Antwerp which was presented to him at the Franciscan monastery. This manuscript was likely lost during the times of Napoleon, however it was said to have contained the Johannine Comma in the margin, as Erasmus mentions it in his Annotations. Nevertheless, Erasmus doubted the originality of that marginal note within the manuscript and believed that it was a recent addition within it. The exact nature of this manuscript from Antwerp is unknown, scholars such as Mills, Küster and Allen have argued that it was a Greek New Testament manuscript. However, others such as Wettstein have proposed that this was instead a manuscript of the commentary of Bede (672/3 – 26 May 735).

==Patristic writers==

=== Clement of Alexandria ===

The comma is absent from an extant fragment of Clement of Alexandria (), through Cassiodorus (6th century), with homily style verse references from 1 John, including verse 1 John 5:6 and 1 John 5:8 without verse 7, the heavenly witnesses.

Another reference that is studied is from Clement&#x27;s &quot;Prophetic Extracts&quot;:
This is seen by some as allusion evidence that Clement was familiar with the verse.

=== Tertullian ===
Tertullian, in &quot;Against Praxeas&quot; (), supports a Trinitarian view by quoting John 10:30:

While many other commentators have argued against any Comma evidence here, most emphatically John Kaye&#x27;s, &quot;far from containing an allusion to 1 Jo. v. 7, it furnishes most decisive proof that he knew nothing of the verse&quot;. Georg Strecker comments cautiously &quot;An initial echo of the occurs as early as Tertullian Adv. Pax. 25.1 (CChr 2.1195; written c. 215). In his commentary on John 16:14 he writes that the Father, Son, and Paraclete are one (), but not one person (). However, this passage cannot be regarded as a certain attestation of the &quot;

References from Tertullian in &quot;De Pudicitia&quot; 21:16 (On Modesty):

and &quot;De Baptismo&quot;:

have also been presented as verse allusions.

=== Treatise on Rebaptism ===
The Treatise on Rebaptism, placed as a 3rd-century writing and transmitted with Cyprian&#x27;s works, has two sections that directly refer to the earthly witnesses, and thus has been used against authenticity by Nathaniel Lardner, Alfred Plummer and others. However, because of the context being water baptism and the precise wording being , the Matthew Henry Commentary uses this as evidence for Cyprian speaking of the heavenly witnesses in Unity of the Church. Arthur Cleveland Coxe and Nathaniel Cornwall also consider the evidence as suggestively positive, as do Westcott and Hort. After approaching the Tertullian and Cyprian references negatively, &quot;morally certain that they would have quoted these words had they known them&quot; Westcott writes about the Rebaptism Treatise:

=== Jerome ===
The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1910 asserts that Jerome &quot;does not seem to know the text&quot;, but Charles Forster suggests that the &quot;silent publication of [the text] in the Vulgate ... gives the clearest proof that down to his time the genuineness of this text had never been disputed or questioned.&quot;

Many Vulgate manuscripts, including the Codex Fuldensis, the earliest extant Vulgate manuscript, include a Prologue to the Canonical Epistles referring to the Comma:

The Prologue presents itself as a letter of Jerome to Eustochium, to whom Jerome dedicated his commentary on the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel. Despite the first-person salutation, some claim it is the work of an unknown imitator from the late 5th century. (The Prologue references the Comma, but the Codex&#x27;s version of 1 John omits it, which has led many to believe that the &quot;Prologue&quot; reference is spurious.) Its inauthenticity is arguably stressed by the omission of the passage from the manuscript&#x27;s own text of 1 John; however, this can also be seen as confirming the claim in the Prologue that scribes tended to drop the text.

==== Marcus Celedensis ====
Coming down with the writings of Jerome is the extant statement of faith attributed to Marcus Celedensis, friend and correspondent to Jerome, presented to Cyril:

==== Phoebadius of Agen ====
Similarly, Jerome wrote of Phoebadius of Agen in his &quot;Lives of Illustrious Men&quot;. &quot;Phoebadius, bishop of Agen, in Gaul, published a book Against the Arians. There are said to be other works by him, which I have not yet read. He is still living, infirm with age.&quot; William Hales looks at Phoebadius:

Griesbach argued that Phoebadius was only making an allusion to Tertullian, and his unusual explanation was commented on by Reithmayer.

=== Augustine ===
Augustine of Hippo has been said to be completely silent on the matter, which has been taken as evidence that the Comma did not exist as part of the epistle&#x27;s text in his time. This has been contested by other scholars, including Fickermann and Metzger. In addition, some Augustine references have been seen as verse allusions.

The City of God section, from Book V, Chapter 11:

has often been referenced as based upon the scripture verse of the heavenly witnesses. George Strecker acknowledges the City of God reference: &quot;Except for a brief remark in (5.11; CChr 47.141), where he says of Father, Word, and Spirit that the three are one. Augustine († 430) does not cite the . But it is certain on the basis of the work 2.22.3 (PL 42.794–95) that he interpreted 1 John 5:7–8 in trinitarian terms.&quot; Similarly, Homily 10 on the first Epistle of John has been asserted as an allusion to the verse:

 has received attention especially for these two sections, especially the allegorical interpretation.

John Scott Porter writes:

Thomas Joseph Lamy offers a different view based on the context and Augustine&#x27;s purpose. Similarly Thomas Burgess. And Norbert Fickermann&#x27;s reference and scholarship supports the idea that Augustine may have deliberately bypassed a direct quote of the heavenly witnesses.

=== Leo the Great ===
In the &quot;Tome of Leo&quot;, written to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, read at the Council of Chalcedon on 10 October 451 AD, and published in Greek, Leo the Great&#x27;s usage of 1 John 5 has him moving in discourse from verse 6 to verse 8:

This epistle from Leo was considered by Richard Porson to be the &quot;strongest proof&quot; of verse inauthenticity. In response, Thomas Burgess points out that the context of Leo&#x27;s argument would not call for the 7th verse. And that the verse was referenced in a fully formed manner centuries earlier than Porson&#x27;s claim, at the time of Fulgentius and the Council of Carthage. Burgess pointed out that there were multiple confirmations that the verse was in the Latin Bibles of Leo&#x27;s day. Burgess argued, ironically, that the fact that Leo could move from verse 6 to 8 for argument context is, in the bigger picture, favourable to authenticity. &quot;Leo&#x27;s omission of the Verse is not only counterbalanced by its actual existence in contemporary copies, but the passage of his Letter is, in some material respects, favourable to the authenticity of the Verse, by its contradiction to some assertions confidently urged against the Verse by its opponents, and essential to their theory against it.&quot; Today, with the discovery of additional Old Latin evidences in the 19th century, the discourse of Leo is rarely referenced as a significant evidence against verse authenticity.

=== Cyprian of Carthage - &quot;Unity of the Church&quot; ===

The 3rd-century Church father Cyprian (), in writing on the &quot;Unity of the Church 1.6&quot;, quoted John 10:30 and another scriptural spot:
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; concludes &quot;Cyprian ... seems undoubtedly to have had it in mind&quot;. Against this view, Daniel B. Wallace writes that since Cyprian does not quote &#x27;the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit&#x27;, &quot;this in the least does not afford proof that he knew of such wording&quot;. The fact that Cyprian did not quote the &quot;exact wording... indicates that a Trinitarian interpretation was superimposed on the text by Cyprian&quot;. The Critical Text apparatuses have taken varying positions on the Cyprian reference.

The Cyprian citation, dating to more than a century before any extant Epistle of John manuscripts and before the Arian controversies that are often considered pivotal in verse addition/omission debate, remains a central focus of comma research and textual apologetics. The Scrivener view is often discussed. Westcott and Hort assert: &quot;Tert and Cyp use language which renders it morally certain that they would have quoted these words had they known them; Cyp going so far as to assume a reference to the Trinity in the conclusion of v. 8&quot;

In the 20th century, Lutheran scholar Francis Pieper wrote in &quot;Christian Dogmatics&quot; emphasizing the antiquity and significance of the reference. Frequently commentators have seen Cyprian as having the verse in his Latin Bible, even if not directly supporting and commenting on verse authenticity. Some writers have also seen the denial of the verse in the Bible of Cyprian as worthy of special note and humor.

Daniel B. Wallace notes that although Cyprian uses 1 John to argue for the Trinity, he appeals to this as an allusion via the three witnesses—&quot;written of&quot;—rather than by quoting a proof-text—&quot;written that&quot;. Therefore, despite the view of some that Cyprian referred to the passage, the fact that other theologians such as Athanasius of Alexandria and Sabellius and Origen never quoted or referred to that passage is one reason why even many Trinitarians later on also considered the text spurious, and not to have been part of the original text.

==== (Epistle 73) ====
The second, lesser reference from Cyprian that has been involved in the verse debate is from 23.12. Cyprian, while discussing baptism, writes:

Knittel emphasizes that Cyprian would be familiar with the Bible in Greek as well as Latin. &quot;Cyprian understood Greek. He read Homer, Plato, Hermes Trismegistus and Hippocrates ... he translated into Latin the Greek epistle written to him by Firmilianus&quot;.
UBS-4 has its entry for text inclusion as (Cyprian).

=== Ps-Cyprian - Hundredfold Reward for Martyrs and Ascetics ===
The Hundredfold Reward for Martyrs and Ascetics: speaks of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as &quot;three witnesses&quot; and was passed down with the Cyprian corpus. This was only first published in 1914 and thus does not show up in the historical debate. UBS-4 includes this in the apparatus as (Ps-Cyprian).

=== Origen and Athanasius ===

Those who see Cyprian as negative evidence assert that other church writers, such as Athanasius of Alexandria and Origen, never quoted or referred to the passage, which they would have done if the verse was in the Bibles of that era. The contrasting position is that there are in fact such references, and that &quot;evidences from silence&quot; arguments, looking at the extant early church writer material, should not be given much weight as reflecting absence in the manuscripts—with the exception of verse-by-verse homilies, which were uncommon in the Ante-Nicene era.

==== Origen&#x27;s scholium on Psalm 123:2 ====
In the scholium on Psalm 123 attributed to Origen is the commentary:
This has been considered by many commentators, including the translation source Nathaniel Ellsworth Cornwall, as an allusion to verse 7. Ellsworth especially noted the Richard Porson comment in response to the evidence of the Psalm commentary: &quot;The critical chemistry which could extract the doctrine of the Trinity from this place must have been exquisitely refining&quot;. Fabricius wrote about the Origen wording &quot;ad locum 1 Joh v. 7 alludi ab origene non est dubitandum&quot;.

==== Athanasius and Arius at the Council of Nicea ====
Traditionally, Athanasius was considered to lend support to the authenticity of the verse, one reason being the &quot;Disputation with Arius at the Council of Nicea&quot; which circulated with the works of Athanasius, where is found:

Today, many scholars consider this a later work &quot;Pseudo-Athanasius&quot;, perhaps by Maximus the Confessor. Charles Forster in &quot;New Plea&quot; argues for the writing as stylistically Athanasius. While the author and date are debated, this is a Greek reference directly related to the doctrinal Trinitarian-Arian controversies, and one that purports to be an account of Nicaea when those doctrinal battles were raging. The reference was given in UBS-3 as supporting verse inclusion, yet was removed from UBS-4 for reasons unknown.

The &quot;Synopsis of Scripture&quot;, often ascribed to Athanasius, has also been referenced as indicating awareness of the Comma.

=== Priscillian of Avila ===
The earliest quotation which some scholars consider a direct reference to the heavenly witnesses from the First Epistle of John is from the Spaniard Priscillian . The Latin reads:

The English translation:

Theodor Zahn calls this &quot;the earliest quotation of the passage which is certain and which can be definitely dated (circa 380)&quot;, a view expressed by Westcott, Brooke, Metzger and others.

Priscillian was probably a Sabellianist or Modalist Monarchian. Some interpreters have theorized that Priscillian created the . However, there are signs of the , although no certain attestations, even before Priscillian&quot;. And Priscillian in the same section references The Unity of the Church section from Cyprian. In the early 1900s the Karl Künstle theory of Priscillian origination and interpolation was popular: &quot;The verse is an interpolation, first quoted and perhaps introduced by Priscillian (a.d. 380) as a pious fraud to convince doubters of the doctrine of the Trinity.&quot;
Another complementary early reference is an exposition of faith published in 1883 by Carl Paul Caspari from the Ambrosian manuscript, which also contains the Muratorian (canon) fragment.

Edgar Simmons Buchanan, points out that the reading is textually valuable, referencing 1 John 5:7.

The authorship is uncertain, however it is often placed around the same period as Priscillian. Karl Künstle saw the writing as anti-Priscillianist, which would have competing doctrinal positions utilizing the verse. Alan England Brooke notes the similarities of the Expositio with the Priscillian form, and the Priscillian form with the Leon Palimpsest. Theodor Zahn refers to the as &quot;possibly contemporaneous&quot; to Priscillian, &quot;apparently taken from the proselyte Isaac (alias Ambrosiaster)&quot;.

John Chapman looked closely at these materials and the section in around the Priscillian faith statement . Chapman saw an indication that Priscillian found himself bound to defend the comma by citing from the &quot;Unity of the Church&quot; Cyprian section.

=== Council of Carthage, 484 ===

&quot;The Comma ... was invoked at Carthage in 484 when the Catholic bishops of North Africa confessed their faith before Huneric the Vandal (Victor de Vita, &quot;Historia persecutionis Africanae Prov&quot; 2.82 [3.11]; CSEL, 7, 60).&quot; The Confession of Faith representing the hundreds of Orthodox bishops included the following section, emphasizing the heavenly witnesses to teach (&quot;clearer than the light&quot;):

==== and ====

There are additional heavenly witnesses references that are considered to be from the same period as the Council of Carthage, including references that have been attributed to Vigilius Tapsensis who attended the Council. Raymond Brown gives one summary:
... in the century following Priscillian, the chief appearance of the Comma is in tractates defending the Trinity. In PL 62 227–334 there is a work consisting of twelve books ... In Books 1 and 10 (PL 62, 243D, 246B, 297B) the Comma is cited three times. Another work on the Trinity consisting of three books  ... North African origin ca. 450 seems probable. The Comma is cited in 1.5 (CC 90, 20–21).

One of the references in , from Book V:
The reference:

This is in the UBS apparatus as Varimadum.

Ebrard, in referencing this quote, comments, &quot;We see that he had before him the passage in his New Testament in its corrupt form (); but also, that the gloss was already in the text, , but that it was so widely diffused and acknowledged in the West as to be appealed to by him bona fide in his contest with his Arian opponents.&quot;

=== Fulgentius of Ruspe ===

In the 6th century, Fulgentius of Ruspe, like Cyprian a father of the North African Church, skilled in Greek as well as his native Latin, used the verse in the doctrinal battles of the day, giving an Orthodox explanation of the verse against Arianism and Sabellianism.
From (&quot;Reply against the Arians&quot;; Migne (Ad 10; CC 91A, 797)):

Then Fulgentius discusses the earlier reference by Cyprian, and the interweaving of the two Johannine verses, John 10:30 and 1 John 5:7.

Another heavenly witnesses reference from Fulgentius is in (Migne (Frag. 21.4: CC 01A,797)):
==== ====
Also from Fulgentius in :

Today these references are generally accepted as probative to the verse being in the Bible of Fulgentius.
A reference in that is a :

has been assigned away from Fulgentius to a &quot;Catholic controvertist of the same age&quot;.

=== Cassiodorus ===

Cassiodorus wrote Bible commentaries, and was familiar with Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts, seeking out sacred manuscripts. Cassiodorus was also skilled in Greek. In , first published in 1721 by Scipio Maffei, in the commentary section on 1 John, from the Cassiodorus corpus, is written:

Thomas Joseph Lamy describes the Cassiodorus section and references that Tischendorf saw this as Cassiodorus having the text in his Bible. However, earlier &quot;Porson endeavoured to show that Cassiodorus had, in his copy, no more than the 8th verse, to which he added the gloss of Eucherius, with whose writings he was acquainted.&quot;

=== Isidore of Seville ===
In the early 7th century, the is often attributed to Isidore of Seville:

Arthur-Marie Le Hir asserts that evidences like Isidore and the Ambrose Ansbert Commentary on Revelation show early circulation of the Vulgate with the verse and thus also should be considered in the issues of Jerome&#x27;s original Vulgate text and the authenticity of the Vulgate Prologue. Cassiodorus has also been indicated as reflecting the Vulgate text, rather than simply the Vetus Latina.

=== &quot;Commentary on Revelation&quot; ===
Ambrose Ansbert refers to the scripture verse in his Revelation commentary:

&quot;Ambrose Ansbert, in the middle of the eighth century, wrote a comment upon the Apocalypse, in which this verse is applied, in explaining the 5th verse of the first chapter of the Revelation&quot;.

==Medieval use==

===Fourth Lateran Council===

In the Middle Ages a Trinitarian doctrinal debate arose around the position of Joachim of Fiore (1135–1202) which was different from the more traditional view of Peter Lombard (c. 1100–1160). When the Fourth Council of the Lateran was held in 1215 at Rome, with hundreds of Bishops attending, the understanding of the heavenly witnesses was a primary point in siding with Lombard, against the writing of Joachim.

The Council thus printed the verse in both Latin and Greek, and this may have contributed to later scholarship references in Greek to the verse. The reference to &quot;some manuscripts&quot; showed an acknowledgment of textual issues, yet this likely related to &quot;and the three are one&quot; in verse eight, not the heavenly witnesses in verse seven. The manuscript issue for the final phrase in verse eight and the commentary by Thomas Aquinas were an influence upon the text and note of the Complutensian Polyglot.

===Latin commentaries===

In this period, the greater portion of Bible commentary was written in Latin. The references in this era are extensive and wide-ranging. Some of the better-known writers who utilized the comma as scripture, in addition to Peter Lombard and Joachim of Fiore, include Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester), Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Duns Scotus, Roger of Wendover (historian, including the Lateran Council), Thomas Aquinas (many verse uses, including one which has Origen relating to &quot;the three that give witness in heaven&quot;), William of Ockham (of razor fame), Nicholas of Lyra and the commentary of the Glossa Ordinaria.

===Greek commentaries===

Emanual Calecas (a greek catholic) references the comma in the 14th century and Joseph Bryennius (c. 1350–1430) is allegedly referencing the comma in the 15th century both in greek (the latter according to Eugenios Voulgaris; since Voulgaris was involved in the Comma debate in the 18th century and the alleged citation is almost identical to the 1535 Novum Testamentum Omne the genuineness of the citation is debatable).

The Orthodox accepted the comma as Johannine scripture notwithstanding its absence in the Greek manuscripts line. The Orthodox Confession of Faith, published in Greek in 1643 by the multilingual scholar Peter Mogila specifically references the comma. &quot;Accordingly the Evangelist teacheth (1 John v. 7.) There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost and these three are one ...&quot;

===Armenia – Synod of Sis===

The Epistle of Gregory, the Bishop of Sis, to Haitho c. 1270 utilized 1 John 5:7 in the context of the use of water in the mass. The Synod of Sis of 1307 expressly cited the verse, and deepened the relationship with Rome.

Commentators generally see the Armenian text from the 13th century on as having been modified by the interaction with the Latin church and Bible, including the addition of the comma in some manuscripts.

===Manuscripts and special notations===

There are a number of special manuscript notations and entries relating to 1 John 5:7. Vulgate scholar Samuel Berger reports on Corbie MS 13174 in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris that shows the scribe listing four distinct textual variations of the heavenly witnesses. Three are understood by the scribe to have textual lineages of Athanasius, Augustine (two) and Fulgentius. And there is in addition a margin text of the heavenly witnesses that matches the Theodulphian recension. The Franciscan Correctorium gives a note about there being manuscripts with the verses transposed. The Regensburg ms. referenced by Fickermann discusses the positions of Jerome and Augustine. Contarini, The Glossa Ordinaria discusses the Vulgate Prologue in the Preface, in addition to its commentary section on the verse. John J. Contrini in &quot;Haimo of Auxerre, Abbot of Sasceium (Cessy-les-Bois), and a New Sermon on I John v. 4–10&quot; discusses a 9th-century manuscript and the Leiden sermon.

==Inclusion by Erasmus==
The central figure in the 16th-century history of the Johannine Comma is the humanist Erasmus, and his efforts leading to the publication of the Greek New Testament. The comma was omitted in the first edition in 1516, the &quot;Nouum instrumentum omne: diligenter ab Erasmo Roterodamo recognitum et emendatum&quot; and the second edition of 1519. The verse is placed in the third edition, published in 1522, and those of 1527 and 1535.

Erasmus included the comma, with commentary, in his paraphrase edition, first published in 1520. And in &quot;Ratio seu methodus compendio perueniendi ad ueram theologiam&quot;, first published in 1518, Erasmus included the comma in the interpretation of John 12 and 13. Erasmian scholar John Jack Bateman, discussing the &quot;Paraphrase&quot; and the &quot;Ratio uerae theologiae&quot;, says of these uses of the comma that &quot;Erasmus attributes some authority to it despite any doubts he had about its transmission in the Greek text.&quot;
The New Testament of Erasmus provoked critical responses that focused on a number of verses, including his text and translation decisions on , John 1:1, , and Philippians 2:6. The absence of the comma from the first two editions received a sharp response from churchmen and scholars, and was discussed and defended by Erasmus in the correspondence with Edward Lee and Diego López de Zúñiga (Stunica), and Erasmus is also known to have referenced the verse in correspondence with Antoine Brugnard in 1518. The first two Erasmus editions only had a small note about the verse. The major Erasmus writing regarding comma issues was in the &quot;Annotationes&quot; to the third edition of 1522, expanded in the fourth edition of 1527 and then given a small addition in the fifth edition of 1535.

Erasmus is said to have replied to his critics that the comma did not occur in any of the Greek manuscripts he could find, but that he would add it to future editions if it appeared in a single Greek manuscript. When a single such manuscript (the Codex Montfortianus), was subsequently found to contain it, he added the comma to his 1522 edition, though he expressed doubt as to the authenticity of the passage in his &quot;Annotations&quot; and added a lengthy footnote setting out his suspicion that the manuscript had been prepared expressly to confute him. This manuscript had probably been produced in 1520 by a Franciscan who translated it from the Vulgate. This change was accepted into editions based on the Textus Receptus, the chief source for the King James Version, thereby fixing the comma firmly in the English-language scriptures for centuries. There is no explicit evidence, however, that such a promise was ever made.

The authenticity of the story of Erasmus is questioned by many scholars. Bruce Metzger removed this story from his book&#x27;s (&quot;The Text of the New Testament&quot;) third edition although it was included in the first and second editions in the same book.

Despite being a commonly accepted fact in modern scholarship, some people in the past such as Thomas Burgess (1756 – 19 February 1837) have disputed the identification of Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Codex Britannicus&quot; as the same manuscript as the Codex Montfortianus, instead proposing that it is a now lost Greek manuscript.

==Modern reception==

In 1807 Charles Butler described the dispute to that point as consisting of three distinct phases.

===Erasmus and the Reformation===
The 1st phase began with the disputes and correspondence involving Erasmus with Edward Lee followed by Jacobus Stunica. And about the 16th-century controversies, Thomas Burgess summarized &quot;In the sixteenth century its chief opponents were Socinus, Blandrata, and the Fratres Poloni; its defenders, Ley, Beza, Bellarmine, and Sixtus Senensis.&quot; In the 17th century John Selden in Latin and Francis Cheynell and Henry Hammond were English writers with studies on the verse, Johann Gerhard and Abraham Calovius from the German Lutherans, writing in Latin.

===Simon, Newton, Mill and Bengel===
The 2nd dispute stage begins with Sandius, the Arian around 1670. Francis Turretin published &quot;De Tribus Testibus Coelestibus&quot; in 1674 and the verse was a central focus of the writings of Symon Patrick. In 1689 the attack on authenticity by Richard Simon was published in English, in his &quot;Critical History of the Text of the New Testament&quot;. Many responded directly to the views of Simon, including Thomas Smith, Friedrich Kettner, James Benigne Bossuet, Johann Majus, Thomas Ittigius, Abraham Taylor and the published sermons of Edmund Calamy. There was the verse defences by John Mill and later by Johann Bengel. Also in this era was the David Martin and Thomas Emlyn debate. There were attacks on authenticity by Richard Bentley and Samuel Clarke and William Whiston and defence of authenticity by John Guyse in the Practical Expositor. There were writings by numerous additional scholars, including posthumous publication in London of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Two Letters&quot; in 1754 (&quot;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture&quot;), which he had written to John Locke in 1690. The mariner&#x27;s compass poem of Bengel was given in a slightly modified form by John Wesley.

===Travis and Porson debate===

The &quot;third stage of the controversy&quot; begins with the quote from Edward Gibbon in 1776:
Even the Scriptures themselves were profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable text, which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in heaven, is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts. It was first alleged by the Catholic bishops whom Hunneric summoned to the conference of Carthage. An allegorical interpretation, in the form, perhaps, of a marginal note, invaded the text of the Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected in a dark period of ten centuries.
It is followed by the response of George Travis that led to the Porson–Travis debate. In the 1794 3rd edition of &quot;Letters to Edward Gibbon&quot;, Travis included a 42-part appendix with source references. Another event coincided with the inauguration of this stage of the debate: &quot;a great stirring in sacred science was certainly going on. Griesbach&#x27;s first edition of the New Testament (1775–7) marks the commencement of a new era.&quot; The Griesbach GNT provided an alternative to the Received Text editions to assist as scholarship textual legitimacy for opponents of the verse.

===19th century===

Some highlights from this era are the Nicholas Wiseman Old Latin and Speculum scholarship, the defence of the verse by the Germans Immanuel Sander, Besser, Georg Karl Mayer and Wilhelm Kölling, the Charles Forster &quot;New Plea&quot; book which revisited Richard Porson&#x27;s arguments, and the earlier work by his friend Arthur-Marie Le Hir, Discoveries included the Priscillian reference and Exposito Fidei. Also Old Latin manuscripts including La Cava, and the moving up of the date of the Vulgate Prologue due to its being found in Codex Fuldensis. Ezra Abbot wrote on 1 John V.7 and Luther&#x27;s German Bible and Scrivener&#x27;s analysis came forth in Six Lectures and Plain Introduction. In the 1881 Revision came the full removal of the verse. Daniel McCarthy noted the change in position among the textual scholars, and in French there was the sharp Roman Catholic debate in the 1880s involving Pierre Rambouillet, Auguste-François Maunoury, Jean Michel Alfred Vacant, Elie Philippe and Paulin Martin. In Ireland Charles Vincent Dolman wrote about the Revision and the comma in the &quot;Dublin Review&quot;, noting that &quot;the heavenly witnesses have departed&quot;.

===20th century===
The 20th century saw the scholarship of Alan England Brooke and Joseph Pohle, the RCC controversy following the 1897 Papal declaration as to whether the verse could be challenged by Catholic scholars, the Karl Künstle Priscillian-origin theory, the detailed scholarship of Augustus Bludau in many papers, the Eduard Riggenbach book, and the Franz Pieper and Edward F. Hills defences. There were specialty papers by Anton Baumstark (Syriac reference), Norbert Fickermann (Augustine), Claude Jenkins (Bede), Mateo del Alamo, Teófilo Ayuso Marazuela, Franz Posset (Luther) and Rykle Borger (Peshitta). Verse dismissals, such as that given by Bruce Metzger, became popular. There was the fine technical scholarship of Raymond Brown. And the continuing publication and studies of the Erasmus correspondence, writings and Annotations, some with English translation. From Germany came Walter Thiele&#x27;s Old Latin studies and sympathy for the comma being in the Bible of Cyprian, and the research by Henk de Jonge on Erasmus and the Received Text and the comma.

===Recent scholarship===
The first 20 years of the 21st century have seen a popular revival of interest in the historic verse controversies and the textual debate. Factors include the growth of interest in the Received Text and the Authorized Version (including the King James Version Only movement) and the questioning of Critical Text theories, the 1995 book by Michael Maynard documenting the historical debate on 1 John 5:7, and the internet ability to spur research and discussion with participatory interaction. In this period, King James Bible defenders and opponents wrote a number of papers on the Johannine Comma, usually published in evangelical literature and on the internet. In textual criticism scholarship circles, the book by Klaus Wachtel &quot;Der byzantinische Text der katholischen Briefe: Eine Untersuchung zur Entstehung der Koine des Neuen Testaments&quot;, 1995 contains a section with detailed studies on the Comma. Similarly, &quot;Der einzig wahre Bibeltext?&quot;, published in 2006 by K. Martin Heide. Special interest has been given to the studies of the Codex Vaticanus umlauts by Philip Barton Payne and Paul Canart, senior paleographer at the Vatican Library. The Erasmus studies have continued, including research on the Valladolid inquiry by Peter G. Bietenholz and Lu Ann Homza. Jan Krans has written on conjectural emendation and other textual topics, looking closely at the Received Text work of Erasmus and Beza. And some elements of the recent scholarship commentary have been especially dismissive and negative.

===Catholic Church===
The Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in 1546 defined the Biblical canon as &quot;the entire books with all their parts, as these have been wont to be read in the Catholic Church and are contained in the old Latin Vulgate&quot;. The Comma appeared in both the Sixtine (1590) and the Clementine (1592) editions of the Vulgate. Although the revised Vulgate contained the Comma, the earliest known copies did not, leaving the status of the Comma Johanneum unclear. On 13 January 1897, during a period of reaction in the Church, the Holy Office decreed that Catholic theologians could not &quot;with safety&quot; deny or call into doubt the Comma&#x27;s authenticity. Pope Leo XIII approved this decision two days later, though his approval was not &quot;in forma specifica&quot;—that is, Leo XIII did not invest his full papal authority in the matter, leaving the decree with the ordinary authority possessed by the Holy Office. Three decades later, on 2 June 1927, Pope Pius XI decreed that the Comma Johanneum was open to investigation.

===King James Only movement===
In more recent years, the Comma has become relevant to the King James Only Movement, a Protestant development most prevalent within the fundamentalist and Independent Baptist branch of the Baptist churches. Many proponents view the Comma as an important Trinitarian text. The defense of the verse by Edward Freer Hills in 1956 in his book &quot;The King James Version Defended&quot; in the section &quot;The Johannine Comma (1 John 5:7)&quot; was unusual due to Hills&#x27; textual criticism scholarship credentials.

== Grammatical analysis ==

In 1 John 5:7–8 in the Critical Text and the different editions of the Majority Text, though not the Textus Receptu, we have a shorter text with only the earthly witnesses. And the following words appear:


Grantley Robert McDonald gives the history of the 1780 letter from Eugenius Bulgaris (1716–1806) along with an explanation of the grammatical gender discordance issue when the text has only the earthly witnesses:

The grammatical issue was first noticed by Gregory Naziansus in his disputes with Macedonian Christians, however he did not cite the Johannine Comma itself. In the medieval era, Desiderius Erasmus also noticed the seemingly unusual grammar when his text has only the earthly witnesses, in addition, Thomas Naogeorgus (1511–1578) also wondered about the grammar. Matthaei reported on a scholium from about 1000 AD. &quot;Porson&#x27;s Letters to Travis&quot; gives the scholium text as &quot;Three in the masculine gender, in token of the Trinity: the spirit, of the Godhead; the water, of the enlightening knowledge to mankind, by the spirit; the blood, of the incarnation.&quot;

Eugenius Bulgaris saw the &quot;heavenly witnesses&quot; as grammatically necessary to explain the masculine grammar, else the earthly witnesses alone would be a solecism. Frederick Nolan, in his 1815 book, An Inquiry into the Integrity of the Greek Vulgate, brought the argument of Eugenius to the English debate. John Oxlee, in debate with Nolan, took the position that the &quot;earthly witnesses&quot; grammar was sound. Robert Dabney took a position similar to Eugenius Bulgaris and Frederick Nolan, as did Edward Hills. However, according Daniel Wallace the grammar can be explained without a need for the Johannine comma, stating each article-participle phrase (οἱ μαρτυροῦντες) in 1 John 5:7-8 functions as a substantive and agrees with the natural gender (masculine) of the idea being expressed (persons). Thus, according to Wallace, the three earthly witnesses were being personalized by John, allowing for the usage of the masculine gender despite the nouns being neuter. 

Some late manuscripts of 1 John 5:7 omit the masculine form of the word &quot;bear witness&quot;. These include GA 044, 254, 1523, 1524, 1844 and 1852.

<text>A lai (or &quot;lay lyrique&quot;, &quot;lyric lay&quot;, to distinguish it from a &quot;lai breton&quot;) is a lyrical, narrative poem written in octosyllabic couplets that often deals with tales of adventure and romance. &quot;Lais&quot; were mainly composed in France and Germany, during the 13th and 14th centuries. The English term 
&quot;lay&quot; is a 13th-century loan from Old French &quot;lai&quot;. The origin of the French term itself is unclear; perhaps it is itself a loan from German &quot;Leich&quot; (reflected in archaic or dialectal English &quot;lake&quot;, &quot;sport, play&quot; and in modern Swedish (att leka = to play). The terms &quot;note&quot;, &quot;nota&quot; and &quot;notula&quot; (as used by Johannes de Grocheio) appear to have been synonyms for &quot;lai&quot;.

The poetic form of the &quot;lai&quot; usually has several stanzas, none of which have the same form. As a result, the accompanying music consists of sections which do not repeat. This distinguishes the lai from other common types of musically important verse of the period (for example, the rondeau and the ballade). Towards the end of its development in the 14th century, some lais repeat stanzas, but usually only in the longer examples. There is one very late example of a lai, written to mourn the defeat of the French at the Battle of Agincourt (1415), (&quot;Lay de la guerre&quot;, by Pierre de Nesson) but no music for it survives.

There are four lais in the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;, all of them anonymous. The &quot;lai&quot; reached its highest level of development as a musical and poetic form in the work of Guillaume de Machaut; 19 separate lais by this 14th-century ars nova composer survive, and they are among his most sophisticated and highly developed secular compositions.

===Comic strips===
====&quot;Daily Express&quot; (1958–1977)====
Comic strip serials released by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; between 1958 and 1977 were divided in two distinct eras, the John McLusky era from 1958 to 1966, and Yaroslav Horak and Jim Lawrence era from 1966 to 1977. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; Bond strips drawn during McLusky era are streamlined adaptations of the Ian Fleming novels and short stories, and feature mainly the same villains. 

During the Yaroslav Horak and Jim Lawrence era, many of the adaptations of Ian Fleming short stories that were featured in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot; were expanded upon. Furthermore, the duo would start to write original Bond stories, starting with the 1968 storyline &quot;The Harpies&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; discontinued publishing James Bond comic strips in 1977. The original creative – Horak, Lawrence and McLusky – would subsequently develop Bond comic strips for other British and European syndications from 1977 to 1984.

==Video game villains==

Following is a list of original main villains in James Bond computer and video games.
==Villainous organisations==
* SMERSH – SMiERt SHpionam, &quot;Death to Spies&quot;, Bond&#x27;s original nemesis in the novels, though only taking an active role in the 1954 TV film, 1967 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and only briefly mentioned in the others (apparently disbanded 20 years before the events of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;). The Soviet agency is in charge of assassination, loosely based on the real-life SMERSH.
* SPECTRE – SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, first appeared in the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; and replaced SMERSH as Bond&#x27;s nemesis in the films. The independent terrorist organisation is headed by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. In the 2015 film, &quot;Spectre&quot;, 007 digs deep into the organisation and tries to get payback for the murder of M (Judi Dench); he discovers the organisation is headed by his adopted brother Franz Oberhauser, now calling himself Blofeld, and that its entire purpose was to personally persecute Bond himself.
* The Spangled Mob – Bond&#x27;s enemy in the novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, appearing also in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. The mob is an American Mafia family based in Las Vegas.
* Drax Metals – Hugo Drax&#x27;s metal company in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, renamed &quot;Drax Industries&quot; in the film, where it specialises in Space Shuttle-like spacecraft.
* Stromberg Shipping Line – Karl Stromberg&#x27;s organisation in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. As well as operating the titular shipping line, it features its own line of laboratories.
* Zorin Enterprises – Max Zorin&#x27;s multinational conglomerate, operating in computer hardware and mining, in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;.
* Entreprises Auric A.G. – Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s organisation in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Divisions include a stud farm in Kentucky named &quot;Auric Stud&quot;.
* KGB – Soviet intelligence agency.
* Janus Syndicate – Alec Trevelyan&#x27;s vehemently anti-British terrorist organisation in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.
* CMGN – Carver Media Group Network, Elliot Carver&#x27;s self-made mass media empire in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.
* The Scales of Justice – A movement in John Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Man from Barbarossa&quot;.
* Yakuza – Japanese crime gang in the novel &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot;.
* COLD – The Children of Last Days, a terrorist organisation that Bond faces in the novel &quot;COLD&quot;.
* The Union – A villainous organisation in Raymond Benson&#x27;s novels &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;, &quot;Doubleshot&quot;, and &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot;.
* OCTOPUS – Replaces SPECTRE in the video game &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (an adaptation of the 1963 film) for copyright reasons.
* BAST – The Brotherhood of Anarchy and Secret Terrorism, featured in the novel &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot;.
* Quantum – A shadowy criminal organisation seen in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. The organisation is strictly apolitical—but with considerable political influence of their own—and will deal with anyone whose interests converge with their own. Known members of the organisation include an extensive network of current and former politicians, business people and intelligence agents. One of their leading members, Dominic Greene, leads a cover organisation called Greene Planet. In &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), the organisation is revealed as a division within Spectre, rather than an independent group.
* SCUM – Stands for &quot;Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem&quot;, the main villainous organisation in the &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; series.
* TAROT – Technological Accession, Revenge and Organized Terror, the replacement for SPECTRE in the &quot;James Bond Roleplaying Game&quot; produced by Victory Games from 1983 to 1987.
* Phoenix International – Rafael Drake&#x27;s organisation in &quot;Nightfire&quot;. Ostensibly a nuclear disposal company, Drake used it to weaponise the nuclear materials it got its hands on in his plan to rule the world.
* King Industries – Sir Robert King&#x27;s multinational oil and construction company in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; and its novelisation and video game adaptations. It was formed through the merge of his own construction business and his wife&#x27;s oil business.
* Osato Chemicals and Engineering – Mr. Osato&#x27;s company, supplying chemicals and engineering equipment in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, heavily affiliated with SPECTRE.
* Graves Corporation – Gustav Graves&#x27; diamond-mining business in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.
* Greene Planet – Dominic Greene&#x27;s environmentalist organisation in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. Really a front for the operations of Quantum, and by extension, Spectre.
* Sanchez Cartel – drug cartel run by Franz Sanchez in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, operating in both Americas and hiding behind many front organisations.
* Rahani Electronics – major electronics company mentioned in &quot;Role of Honour&quot; and &quot;Nobody Lives for Ever&quot;, owned by SPECTRE commander Tamil Rahani, and possibly used by SPECTRE as a front.
* Rattenfänger: paramilitary organization that engages in terrorism in exchange for money, in &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; and &quot;A Spy Like Me&quot;.

<doc id="791758" wikidata="Q333074" url="?curid=791758" title="Moundou">
<text>Moundou () is the second-largest city in Chad and is the capital of the region of Logone Occidental.

The city lies on the Mbéré River (a tributary of the Western Logone) some 475 kilometres south of the capital N&#x27;Djamena. It is the main city of the Ngambai people. Moundou has grown as an industrial centre, home to the Gala Brewery, which produces Chad&#x27;s most popular beer and the cotton and oil industries.

== History ==
The city was created on 8 November 1923 by the French sergeant and administrator Joseph-François Reste, Lieutenant-General of Chad from 1923 to 1926 and future Governor General of French Equatorial Africa, 
 who, from the whaleboat upon which he navigated the Logone, found the site pretty. By 1916, the military conquest of Chad was completed, however movements of resistance to the colonial regime took place. It was especially in the southwest of the country that dissensions continued until about 1930. He decided to found the post of Moundou in the centre of the rebellious zone. The rebellious situation did not change much with the arrival of Lieutenant Robert Reverdy. Chief of the district of the Middle Logone in 1925, Reverdy, who became a director in 1927, completed an uninterrupted stay for five years and eight months. He moved the chief town of the district to Moundou in 1927. Riding the country, on horseback and by litter, he subjected the organisation of strong chieftains, first of village then of township.

On 20 April 1930, Governor Georges Prouteaux of Oubangi-Chari (the district was attached to Oubangui-Chari in 1926) signed a decision reorganising the &quot;indigenous of the Middle Logone&quot; by creating 40 cantons, divided into five subdivisions. Reverdy had his right-hand man, local chief Hassan Moundou or Hassan Baguirmi, of Baguirmian or rather Baguirmianised Dekakire Arab origin, installed as chief of the township of Moundou. Not all chiefs were of traditional origin. In the animist country, custom only recognised clan chiefs or war or initiation leaders, who were strictly specialised and temporary. However, the system was accepted by the population, and some chiefs remained in office for more than a quarter of a century. Their descendants are still in place today.

Reverdy (called &quot;Baoguel&quot;, the &quot;Left-Handed&quot;, in the Ngambay language) urbanised the post of Moundou that he established. He planted the flowers (from February to May) that line the roads of Moundou, which became the origin of the nickname of the city during the colonial period, &quot;Moundou-la-Rouge&quot;.

In 1926 the Cotton Company of the Congo installed a ginning factory in Moundou. The cotton company later became Cotonfran in 1928 and then CotonTchad in 1972.

The first cadastral map of the town of Moundou was manufactured on 2 February 1926. Since there were not, at the time, the materials for substantial topographical surveys, the drainage pipeline of the town was facing the river in the belief that the natural inclination would head toward the river, when in reality the river level is higher than the level of the city. In 2012, the mayor of Moundou, Laoukein Kourayo Médard, said that &quot;every time there was a flood, all the waters of the Logone discharged to Lake Wey (in the West), which in turn sprays its water into the city, flooding Moundou entirely.&quot;

<doc id="791763" wikidata="Q2936966" url="?curid=791763" title="Cap-Rouge, Quebec City">
<text>Cap-Rouge () is a former city in central Quebec, Canada, since 2002 within the borough Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge in Quebec City. The site of the first attempted permanent French settlement in North America, Charlesbourg-Royal, is located at the confluence of the Rivière du Cap Rouge and the Saint Lawrence River. Its population was 13,153 as of the Canada 2011 Census.

==First permanent establishments==
In 1635, the first seigneurie was granted on the territory of Cape-Rouge, but revoked the following year by the Company of One Hundred Associates. However, by 1638 Paul Le Jeune, a missionary Jesuit, had noted in &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot; the presence of some families in the valley. Between 1647 and 1652, the seigneuries of Maur, on the west, and Gaudarville, in the east, were established on the territory. From that moment, based on taxable citizens, the settlement on the lands of Cap-Rouge are established. The village formed is served by the parishes of Ancienne-Lorette in (1678) to the north; of Saint-Augustin in (1691) on the west; and of Sainte-Foy (1698) in the east.

==Geography==

The name of Cap-Rouge, meaning &quot;red cape&quot;, comes from its cliffs facing the Saint-Lawrence river and made of schist rock bearing a reddish tint. The other main topographic feature of Cap-Rouge is the Rivière du Cap Rouge valley where are concentrated some historic buildings as well the archeological remains of a pottery workshop active from 1860 to 1892. It is believed that until the end of its operations the workshop mainly used imported clay rather than the local one, which has a rather red hue.

The Cap-Rouge area is located to the south of the Canadian Shield and Laurentian Mountains, at the confluence of the geological regions of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands and of the northern Appalachians. It mostly sits at the western foot of the Quebec promontory, in the way of the Logan&#x27;s Line - an inactive fracture in the Earth&#x27;s crust first documented by William Edmond Logan.

==Attractions==

In addition to its long history, the main attraction of Cap-Rouge is the towering Cap-Rouge trestle () rail-road bridge. Built in 1907-1908, the steel trestle was constructed under the authority of the National Transcontinental as part of the National Transcontinental Railway. It spans 3,335 feet at an average of 172 feet above ground and is still in use today.

<text>Road is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language road thriller film produced by Ram Gopal Varma and directed by Rajat Mukherjee, starring Manoj Bajpayee, Vivek Oberoi and Antara Mali. An eloped couple Arvind (Vivek Oberoi) and Lakshmi (Antara Mali), en route Delhi to Jodhpur on a deserted highway, encounter a mad wayfarer (Vijay Raaz), a hitchhiker Babu (Manoj Bajpayee) who turns out to be a serial psychopathic killer, Inderpal (Makrand Deshpande), a happy-go-lucky, intelligent, and responsible truck driver, and an irresponsible, eccentric cop (Sayaji Shinde).

==Plot==
Arvind (Vivek Oberoi) and Lakshmi (Antara Mali) are in love and want to get married. However, Lakshmi&#x27;s dad, a cop, is against their affair. Hence the two decide to elope from Delhi and travel to get married at Arvind&#x27;s ancestral haveli in Rajgarh, Alwar, Rajasthan, by road, passing by a desert, in a Tata Safari.

After an escape from an aggravated assault by a mad wayfarer (Vijay Raaz), they bump into a smooth-talking hitchhiker Babu (Manoj Bajpayee), who is stranded in the middle of nowhere. Babu convinces the young couple to give him a lift. Travelling with Babu proves a nightmare for Arvind and Lakshmi as Babu turns out to be a psychopath. Soon, Lakshmi finds herself as hostage of an armed Babu. Thanks to the timely intervention of a truck driver Inderpal (Makrand Deshpande) and the highway petrol bunk owner, an aspiring actor Bhanwar Singh (Rajpal Yadav), Arvind rescues Lakshmi from Babu.

After a while, Babu again finds a way, after attacking Inderpal, and again attacks the couple by haunting them on the road via Inderpal&#x27;s truck. But, this time, Babu fails to get hold of the couple. After lodging an FIR, in the nearest police station, the couple finds a motel and they recuperate. The next day Babu again attacks the couple and elopes with Lakshmi.

When the car breaks down on the way, Babu kills another victim, a traveler (Snehal Dabi) attracted to Lakshmi, and elopes in the traveler&#x27;s vehicle. As the cops are on their way to catch hold of him, he manages to evade them.

On the other hand, the cops suspect Arvind as the serial killer, as he first eloped with Lakshmi, who is D.C.P&#x27;s daughter. This irresponsible intervention of the cop (Sayaji Shinde), who fail to trust Arvind, makes it impossible to chase Lakshmi. Finally, a frustrated Arvind, manages to escape with the cops&#x27; jeep. The full focus of the police is now on Arvind as they believe him to have committed a murder and dumped the body in a car and that the story of Babu and Lakshmi is a fabrication. Arvind manages to flee to a small bar where he reunites with Inderpal. He and Inderpal now try to track Babu down with the help of Inderpal&#x27;s truck but are spotted by the police who give a chase. Inderpal is injured in the gunfight and Arvind drives him to a hospital.

Meanwhile, Babu forces his way into a bungalow by attacking its caretaker while the owner was away. There, Lakshmi begins to show signs that she is on Babu&#x27;s side. The caretaker of the house is tied up but manages to call the police on Babu. At the same time, the police also find Arvind&#x27;s vehicle and in it, a photograph of himself and Lakshmi, indicating that Arvind is innocent and was telling the truth. At the hospital, Arvind has an encounter with the police and overcomes a cop and is about to tie him up when that cop gets informed through the radio that Arvind is innocent.

The police reach the bungalow the following morning where Babu kills two policemen before escaping. Arvind, finally having his name cleared, joins the police in chasing down Babu. He takes control of a police bike after its rider was shot down by Babu. Arvind chases Babu into the desert where the vehicle breaks down again. Babu and Lakshmi get out of the car and Arvind too gets off his bike and starts coming for Babu. Babu tells Lakshmi that there is only one bullet left in the gun and that will kill Arvind. However, just as he is about to shoot, Lakshmi attacks Babu, causing the last bullet to miss. Arvind takes advantage of the distraction and attacks Babu. Arvind badly beats Babu and the couple, reunited, leave Babu to die in the desert and continue on their journey on the police bike.

<doc id="791771" wikidata="Q440727" url="?curid=791771" title="The Cramp Twins">
<text>The Cramp Twins is an animated television series created by British cartoonist Brian Wood based on his 1995 graphic novel of the same name. The show was produced by Sunbow Entertainment (in season 1), Telemagination (in season 2), and TV-Loonland AG, in association with Cartoon Network Europe.

==Overview==

The series follows the day-day exploits of Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), fraternal twin brothers who live with their germophobic mother Dorothy (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father Horace (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional, industrial town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucien&#x27;s personalities clash, and they hate one another. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Jayne Peterson) has a crush on him, but he despises her. Wayne&#x27;s and Lucien&#x27;s teacher is Miss Hillary Hissy (Cathy Weseluck). Lucien&#x27;s friends include swamp-dweller Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen) and socially-awkward Mari Phelps (Tabitha St. Germain).

Two seasons of &quot;The Cramp Twins&quot; were made altogether. In the United States, season 1 aired as two separate seasons, and did not get broadcast until long after it had aired in its home country. All episodes were aired 2–3 years earlier in the UK leaving one episode from season 2 (4 in the US) unaired.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Wayne Cramp (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the periwinkle-skinned younger of the twins, but is taller than Lucien.
* Lucien Cramp (voiced by Kath Soucie) is Wayne&#x27;s older twin brother, as the opening credits indicate. Lucien is the smarter of the twins, and is considered an &quot;eco-nerd&quot;.
* Dorothy Cramp (née O&#x27;Neil) (voiced by Nicole Oliver), is the yellow-skinned strict mother to the twins, and wife of Horace Cramp.
* Horace Cramp (voiced by Ian James Corlett) is the green-skinned and inept father of Wayne and Lucien and husband of Dorothy Cramp.
* Tony Parsons (voiced by Terry Klassen) is Lucien&#x27;s best friend and a swamp child.
* Wendy Winkle (voiced by Jayne Paterson) is the only daughter of Walter Winkle. She has a huge crush on Wayne.
* Mari Phelps (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) is Lucien&#x27;s other friend. She often co-operates with Lucien on his environment-conserving efforts, but often can&#x27;t help desiring a bit of power.

===Recurring===
* Dirty Joe Muldoon: (voiced by Lee Tockar) A dim-witted, lonely, middle-aged man who owns the local junkyard frequented by Wayne. He is Wayne&#x27;s best and only friend. He is an unseen character (except for a hand and part of his clothes).
* Walter Winkle: (voiced by Colin Murdock) Mr Cramp&#x27;s boss and Wendy&#x27;s father. He owns the city&#x27;s soap-producing factory.
* Hillary Hissy: (voiced by Cathy Weseluck) Hillary (Miss Hissy) is Wayne&#x27;s, Lucien&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s and Mari&#x27;s oversized teacher.
* Seth Parsons: (voiced by Terry Klassen) Tony&#x27;s father and a swamp person.
* Mr. Pretty: (voiced by Jay Brazeau) is the overly peppy principal of the school introduced in the second season.
* Lillian &quot;Lilly&quot; Parsons: (voiced by Pauline Newstone) Seth&#x27;s wife and the mother of Tony and his siblings.
* Mrs. Phelps (voiced by Kath Soucie): Mari&#x27;s mother. She is the strictest member of the family.
* Mr. Phelps (voiced by Colin Murdock): Mari&#x27;s dad. He works at the opticians.
* Agent X: A mysterious and charismatic character portrayed as an FBI Agent (or similar).

===Minor===
* Mrs. Winkle: (voiced by Cathy Weseluck) Wendy&#x27;s mother and Walter Winkle&#x27;s wife. She behaves more or less like her husband, but ignores/denies the fact they&#x27;re related to Swamp People.
* Barber: Dorothy takes Lucien and Wayne to see him, and due to a number of circumstances, ends up shutting down his shop entirely. He appears to dislike and to be scared of Tony, as Tony did not pay his hair shaving fees.
* Rodeo Rita: (voiced by Kath Soucie) A bull rider and country yodeler who turns out to be a fraud. Horace is a big fan of hers, and has a crush on her; the revelation did almost nothing to affect his opinion of her.
* Big Baby: The boys&#x27; unnamed female cousin. Although she is five years old, she can barely speak or walk.
* Marsha and Tandy: Dorothy&#x27;s so-called friends. Marsha is voiced by Ellen Kennedy and Tandy is voiced by Iris Quinn. They are often seen arguing or insulting each other and often take delight in Dorothy&#x27;s domestic misfortunes (i.e. Wayne and/or Lucien embarrassing her, behaving in an unsanitary manner, etc.).

==Production and development==
&quot;The Cramp Twins&quot; was developed between Sunbow Entertainment and Cartoon Network Europe during the development of their first co-production &quot;Fat Dog Mendoza&quot;. The production of the series was announced in July 1999.

In October 2000, Sony Wonder&#x27;s TV arm was acquired by German company TV-Loonland AG, putting &quot;The Cramp Twins&quot; under the control of Loonland.

In March 2001, TV-Loonland AG pre-sold the British terrestrial rights to the series to the BBC. In September, the series was pre-sold in Germany to KI.KA. By late 2001, the series pre-sold to TF1 in France, and TV-Loonland subsidiary Salsa Distribution pre-sold the series in Latin America to Fox Kids.

In 2002, the second season was produced by Telemagination, a British animation company that TV-Loonland owned. By that time, the series was picked up in over 50 countries worldwide.

==Broadcast==
&quot;The Cramp Twins&quot; premiered in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2001 on Cartoon Network and on BBC One during the CBBC programming block, later airing on the CBBC channel itself in February 2002. The show achieved high popularity with children in the UK, pulling in 1.5 million viewers a week on CBBC and becoming the top-rated weekend series on Cartoon Network during its initial broadcast. Although the series ended, reruns continued to air on CBBC and Cartoon Network for a few years afterwards, with Cartoon Network airing the show well into the mid-2010s at night, in order to fill European content requirements alongside &quot;Skatoony&quot; and &quot;Robotboy&quot;. It was also repeated on Boomerang UK and Cartoon Network Too.

In early 2003, 4Kids Entertainment acquired the exclusive merchandise licensing, television broadcast and home video rights for the series within the United States. The series premiered in the country on the company&#x27;s FoxBox Saturday morning block on Fox on 8 February on the same year. It would continue to air on the block at various intervals until 19 August 2006. The series also aired on Cartoon Network in the US from 14 June 2004 to April 2005.

In Canada, the series aired on YTV, premiering in 2004.

==Home media==
===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the series was released on DVD (with Volume 1 also released on VHS) by Metrodome Distribution, a home video company that TV-Loonland AG majority-owned at the time. Volumes 4 and 5 were released under the distributor&#x27;s &quot;Mini Metro&quot; budget range.

All episodes released on DVD in the country made up the entirety of Series 1. Volume 5 also includes a Season 2 episode.

&quot;Sick Daze / Picket Picket&quot; was also featured on a compilation VHS and DVD called &quot;Boys Stuff&quot; from 2004 which also featured episodes from &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, &quot;Yvon of the Yukon&quot; and &quot;Super Duper Sumos&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, two DVDs containing 11 segments each were released on DVD by Platinum Disc and 4Kids Home Video.

The first, &quot;Twin-Compatible&quot;, was released on 19 April 2005, and the other, &quot;Twin-Sult&quot;, was released on 10 March 2006.

<text>The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU; ) is the governing body of rugby union in Scotland. Now marketed as Scottish Rugby, it is the second-oldest Rugby Union, having been founded in 1873. The SRU oversees the national league system, known as the Scottish League Championship, and the Scottish National teams. The SRU is headed by the President (Keith Wallace) and Chairman (John McGuigan), with Mark Dodson acting as the chief executive officer. Dee Bradbury became the first female president of a Tier 1 rugby nation upon her appointment on 4 August 2018.

==History==
===1873–1920s===
The Scottish Football Union was founded on Monday 3 March 1873 at a meeting held at Glasgow Academy, Elmbank Street, Glasgow. Eight clubs were represented at the foundation, Glasgow Academicals; Edinburgh Academical Football Club; West of Scotland F.C.; University of St Andrews Rugby Football Club; Royal High School FP; Merchistonians; Edinburgh University RFC; and Glasgow University. Five of these clubs were, at the time of founding the Scottish Football Union, already members of the previously instituted Rugby Football Union. Although the RFU now represents exclusively English clubs, in its first few years it had members from outside England, there being no other national union. West of Scotland, Glasgow Academicals and Edinburgh University had joined the RFU in 1871 and Edinburgh Academicals and Royal High School FP had joined in 1872. These five renounced membership of the RFU to join the SFU.

The SFU was a founding member of the one and only International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1886 with Ireland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890.)

In 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union. International games were played at Inverleith from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.

===1990s–present===
The SRU owns Murrayfield Stadium which is the main home ground of the Scottish national team, though in 2004 international rugby games were played at Hampden Park in Glasgow and McDiarmid Park in Perth, as part of the SRU&#x27;s campaign to reach out to new audiences outside the traditional rugby areas.

When the Heineken Cup (now replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup) was suggested SRU officials were concerned that Scottish club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that centrally funded so-called &#x27;super-district&#x27; teams might do better.

The four traditional districts—the South (renamed Border Reivers), Edinburgh, Glasgow and the North &amp; Midlands (rebranded as Caledonia Reds)—were given the go-ahead to take part in Europe. For the first two seasons, players were still released to play for their clubs in domestic competition, but eventually the districts became full-time operations.

Then financial difficulties – the SRU&#x27;s high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield – called for retrenchment. After two seasons, financial difficulties forced the SRU to merge the four teams into two. Edinburgh merged with the Border Reivers to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers. Glasgow merged with Caledonian to form a team to be known as Glasgow Caledonian.

The Borders was resurrected in 2002 and joined the second season of the Celtic League, now known as the United Rugby Championship. As a consequence Edinburgh Reivers became simply Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow became Glasgow Rugby. In 2005, all three teams adopted new names. The Borders readopted the name Border Reivers; Edinburgh became Edinburgh Gunners, but would revert to Edinburgh in 2006 due to Arsenal F.C. owning the &quot;Gunners&quot; trademark; and Glasgow became Glasgow Warriors. Furthermore, the SRU planned to have a world-class rugby side for each city or large town in Scotland, when financial circumstances permitted.

In 2007, The Borders team was disbanded yet again as a result of continuing financial difficulties. In the same year, the SRU began organising the Scotland Sevens, first held in Edinburgh and later in Glasgow. For several years, it was the final event in the annual Sevens World Series, but that distinction now belongs to Madrid.

On 21 November 2009 Scotland beat Australia 9–8 after 17 attempts in 27 years.

===Centenary celebrations===
The SRU celebrated its centenary in 1973 with a number of events. Among these was the 1973 International Seven-A-Side Tournament, the first sevens tournament to have national representative sides. The programme for that event also sported the new coat of arms of the SRU that was granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms on 28 February 1973, for the centenary season. The coat of arms is still in use today, but in the main the SRU use the commercial thistle logo on jerseys and stationery. The coat of arms has the motto &quot;Non Sine Gloria&quot;, meaning &quot;Not Without Glory&quot;.

==Domestic Rugby==
The SRU oversees the national league system, known as the Scottish League Championship, and consisting of:
* a Premiership of 20 teams across 2 divisions.
* a National Leagues of 20 teams across 2 regional divisions.
* Regional Leagues of 150 clubs in 18 divisions across three regions

It also oversees the Scottish Cup. It is not directly responsible for local, university or 2nd XV leagues.

===Women&#x27;s &amp; Girls Rugby===

See also Scottish Women&#x27;s Rugby.

Since the Scottish Women&#x27;s Rugby Union merged with Scottish Rugby in 2009 the governing body also oversees Women&#x27;s Fixtures.

*Tennent&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Premier League 2018–19
*Tennent&#x27;s Women&#x27;s National League 1 2018–19
*Tennent&#x27;s Women&#x27;s National League 2 2018–19
*Tennent&#x27;s Women&#x27;s North League 2018-19
*Women&#x27;s National Development League 2018-19

A National Cup competition:

*Sarah Beaney Cup 2015–16
*BT Women&#x27;s Bowl

Regional Cup Competition:

*Donna Kennedy Cup

==National teams==

The SRU oversees Scotland&#x27;s national teams. The most prominent team is the Scotland national rugby union team, which competes in the Six Nations tournament every year and in the Rugby World Cup every four years. The SRU also oversees the Scotland national sevens team, which competes every year in the World Rugby Sevens Series. And the SRU oversees the Scotland national women&#x27;s rugby team.

The head coach of the Scotland national rugby union team is Gregor Townsend, who began in June 2017. Scott Johnson is Director of Rugby.

The head coach of the Scottish national women&#x27;s rugby team is Shade Munro.

==North American initiatives==
On 28 March 2019, the SRU announced that it had taken a minority stake in Old Glory DC, a team set to begin play in Major League Rugby (MLR), the current top level of the sport in the United States and Canada, in 2020. As MLR operates on a &quot;single-entity&quot; business model similar to the two countries&#x27; Major League Soccer, with the league owning all teams and the team operators being league shareholders, this effectively meant that the SRU had taken a small stake in MLR itself.

==Personnel==

The current president is Keith Wallace, who succeeded Colin Rigby in 2024. John McGuigan was appointed chair in May 2023. The Chief Executive Officer is Mark Dodson.

In May 2014, it was announced that Sheila Begbie had been appointed to the newly created post of Head of Women&#x27;s Rugby, reporting directly to the Director of Rugby and she was due to commence this role in August 2014.

<doc id="791794" wikidata="Q7543734" url="?curid=791794" title="SmarTrip">
<text>SmarTrip is a contactless stored-value smart card payment system managed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) uses a compatible payment system called CharmCard. A reciprocity agreement between the MTA and WMATA allows either card to be used for travel on any of the participating transit systems in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Unlike traditional paper farecards or bus passes, SmarTrip/CharmCard is designed to be permanent and reloadable; the term &quot;SmarTrip&quot; may refer to both payment systems unless otherwise noted.

WMATA began using SmarTrip for payment on Metrorail in 1999 followed shortly by Metrobus and Metro parking lots. It was later extended to other public transit systems throughout the region. Although WMATA initially drew criticism due to the limited number of SmarTrip sales locations, distribution has expanded to local convenience stores and supermarkets. By late 2012 all Metrorail stations were equipped with SmarTrip vending machines.

In October 2010, WMATA announced that it was working on a replacement card system because the company that makes SmarTrip cards had stopped producing the existing generation. A new generation of the card with modernized chip technology was launched in 2012. Beginning in 2021, the first-generation SmarTrip cards are being phased out as new faregates are installed that do not support the earlier technology.

In 2014, WMATA began a pilot program with Accenture to revamp the SmarTrip payments, with the goal of an open payment system working with contactless credit cards, government IDs, new transit cards, and more. However, the pilot was terminated and the full proposal was cancelled due to lower-than-expected mobile payment adoption and budget constraints.

Instead, in 2018, WMATA announced that contactless mobile payments would be coming to Metro, this time through a closed system that emulates the physical smart card and works with current fare collection equipment. The reduced scope of the project lowered costs dramatically, while constraining users to loading a balance on a SmarTrip account instead of paying directly from a credit/debit card. Mobile payments through Apple Pay were added in 2020, with Google Pay support following in 2021.

Since March 6, 2016, SmarTrip cards are the only payment method accepted on Metrorail; paper farecards are no longer valid.

== Overview ==
SmarTrip cards are , the same size as a credit card or driver&#x27;s license. The card is brought into close proximity with a circular target on the top or side of each faregate rather than inserted into a slot. Because the card has a radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip inside, it does not need to be touched directly to the target, just held near it; thus the card can be scanned while still inside a wallet or purse passed over the target, affording some speed and convenience over the paper farecards which were physically inserted into a slot. Unlike some systems in which only the card number is stored on the chip and is linked to an account on a network which contains the remaining value, in this system, the remaining value is stored on the card itself, not on a network. Therefore, the card must be present to reload it, and when adding the card to a smart device, the card must remain in close proximity to the device during a process in which the data is deleted from the card and stored on the device. This means that once the card is added to a device, the physical card becomes unusable, and only one device can carry it at a time. In the Metrorail system, using the card to activate the target by will display the value remaining as the faregate opens, both when entering and exiting. On Metrobuses, the farebox will audibly beep and display the remaining value. In all cases, the appropriate fare is deducted automatically, accounting for any applicable transfers and discounts.

In an effort to reduce fraud and waste, Metro announced in October 2008 that it would be eliminating paper bus transfers effective January 4, 2009. All riders who wished to take advantage of reduced-fare transfers were required to pay using SmarTrip. Paper bus passes were eliminated in January 2011 and passes are now only available on SmarTrip.

For SmarTrip, pass rules are different from CharmCard. All Metrorail passes are now available on SmarTrip. These include One-Day, 7-Day, and 28-Day fast passes valid for unlimited travel on Metrorail. A 7-Day Short Trip Pass is also sold, allowing unlimited off-peak rides, and unlimited peak rides for trips costing up to $3.50, with the difference in fare deducted from the stored value on the card if necessary. CharmCard allows a maximum of two of each pass to be stored, so two day passes and two monthly passes, plus cash, can be stored on the card.

Metro also sells SmarTrip cards that are preloaded with a One-Day rail pass online for the same price as just the pass alone ($14 since July 1, 2012), including all of the commemorative SmarTrip cards issued since 2009.

Standard cards can be purchased at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card: SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.

SmarTrip and CharmCard have different qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored on the card in a separate &quot;purse&quot; from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA even if it was loaded on a CharmCard. This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.

Discounted (half-fare) cards have different rules for SmarTrip and CharmCard. SmarTrip for seniors and the disabled may only be purchased in person from a Metro agent or authorized sales office, and the person must show ID and for a disabled rider, proof of disability (either WMATA Disabled ID or Medicare card) CharmCard for seniors and disabled are only available from the MTA reduced fare office at 6 St. Paul Street in downtown Baltimore, with similar requirements (proof of age or disability). Also, while WMATA charges a $2 fee plus the amount to load in value for senior/disabled SmarTrip card, MTA merely requires at least $2 in value to be initially loaded onto a senior/disabled CharmCard; MTA waives any fee for the card.

&quot;Exit fare&quot; machines (used with paper farecards) previously did not accept SmarTrip, and riders with insufficient value to pay their fare were allowed to exit the system with any negative balance. This negative balance must, however, be paid before the card may be used again to enter the system. In addition, the card must contain sufficient value to pay the full fee in order to exit a Metro parking lot. Since SmarTrip owners were allowed to exit the system with an unlimited negative balance, the Metro Board had previously rejected proposals to reduce the price of SmarTrip cards from $5 down to $2.50.
Starting September 1, 2012, Metro began offering $3 rebates to customers who registered their cards online after purchase. The cards still cost $5, but a $3 credit was refunded to the card five days after first use. Also starting September 1, riders have been required to have a minimum balance of $1.20 on their SmarTrip cards (35¢ for half-fare senior/disabled cards) in order to enter the Metrorail system, which reduced the possible negative balance upon exit.
Effective October 1, 2013, the price of the card was reduced to $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum permitted negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with riders who would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to their cards.

SmarTrip cards comply with the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A microchip contained within the card stores its value, as well as the rider&#x27;s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person&#x27;s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.

The SmarTrip system was built and designed by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of San Diego–based Cubic Corporation. As of October 2010 Cubic is reportedly no longer producing the cards.
In December 2010, WMATA issued a request for proposals for a replacement system. The new payment system is expected to use federal employee badges and certain smart phones in addition to the stored value cards. In January 2014 WMATA announced that the contract for the new system was awarded to Accenture.

In May 2012, the transit agency announced the launch of a new generation of SmarTrips cards after the manufacturer stopped producing the earlier generation. The new cards operate and appear identical to customers except for being slightly thinner and cheaper to produce. The newer generation cards can be identified based on serial numbers beginning with &quot;0167&quot;.

==History==
SmarTrip was the first contactless smart card for transit in the United States when WMATA began selling SmarTrip cards on May 18, 1999. By 2004, 650,000 SmarTrip cards were in circulation. On November 12, 2002, the first SmarTrip readers were used on Metrobuses. In May 2004, SmarTrip readers were introduced at parking garage gates. In December 2010, 1,800,000 SmarTrip cards were in use. In February 2011, WMATA replaced the antennas on all Metrorail faregates to improve the speed and range of its faregates&#x27; SmarTrip processing. On September 1, 2020, Apple and WMATA enabled SmarTrip cards to be added to Apple Pay through the Wallet app. Later on June 8, 2021, Google Pay on Android devices became supported as well.

==Kids Ride Free==

===DC One Card===
In May 2011, WMATA and the District of Columbia Department of Transportation started a pilot project to give students in the DC Public Schools &quot;DC One Cards&quot; which are SmarTrip compatible. The new cards serve as both a student identification card and provide reduced or free Metro fares during student commuting hours. The cards are intended to address youth behavior problems in Metrorail stations.

===SmarTrip Card===
In the summer of 2018, the DC One Card Kids Ride Free program was replaced by the SmarTrip Kids Ride Free Program due to difficulties in activating the DC One Cards. All students who live in the District of Columbia, attend a public, charter, or private school in the District of Columbia, and are between the ages of 5 and 21 are eligible for a Kids Ride Free SmarTrip Card. The Kids Ride Free Card, a normal SmarTrip card with a large silver Kids Ride Free sticker on it, allows students to ride the Washington Metro, Metrobus, and the DC Circulator for free. The DC One Card Program officially terminated on October 1, 2018.

== Design ==
On the front of the standard SmarTrip card is a stylized picture of a Metrorail car and Metrobus in front of representations of the Washington Monument, United States Capitol, and stylized versions of classical architecture found in Washington, D.C. The Metro logo appears in the bottom left. A &quot;Senior&quot; SmarTrip is also available that automatically calculates applicable discounted fares for senior citizens (age 65+). The design is identical to the standard SmarTrip except that the card is printed in shades of bright yellow and brown, instead of blue and green. Since the Senior SmarTrip allows for discounted fares, the card may only be purchased in person with a valid ID from a Metro sales office or authorized vendor.

On March 27, 2016, Metro unveiled a new SmarTrip card design, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Metrorail system opening.

Beginning November 2016, MetroAccess cards, which permit use of Metro Access Paratransit and free trips on Metrobus and Metrorail, were replaced with a special personalized SmarTrip card with the user&#x27;s photograph and the Metro Access logo appearing on the front of the card. A companion SmarTrip card is included to allow a companion to also ride free along with the disabled person.

=== Promotional designs ===
The first two promotional SmarTrip cards were issued in 2008 to commemorate the opening of the newly built stadium of the Washington Nationals, Nationals Park. Special SmarTrip cards commemorating the inauguration of President Barack Obama were issued in January 2009 and 2013. In July 2013, a special July 4 commemorative SmarTrip card was introduced.

In June 2014, Metro celebrated the 125th anniversary of the National Zoo by issuing commemorative SmarTrip cards featuring &quot;popular zoo baby residents.&quot;

In July 2014, a commemorative SmarTrip card was issued to celebrate the opening of the Silver Line.

In March 2022, a promotional SmarTrip card was issued to celebrate the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Cards of different designs were also issued in 2023 and 2024. 

== Criticism ==
An early criticism of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations, online, a few selected retailers, and Metro sales offices. However, in 2008, Metro reached an agreement with CVS/pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC-area locations in an effort to increase SmarTrip use. The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains. In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations.

A number of SmarTrip features that were supposed to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip&#x27;s creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip&#x27;s online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.

All trips made with a SmarTrip card, with the exception of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.

There have been complaints when customers&#x27; cards cease to work as a result of placing the card in proximity to metal or physically damaging the card. In such cases Metro guarantees that the fund balance on the card will be transferred to a new card. However, customers have complained that WMATA has not been processing such balance transfers promptly.

===Parking===
After reports of widespread theft by employees of Metro&#x27;s parking contractor, Penn Parking, WMATA announced that as part of a new cashless parking payment system, SmarTrip would be the only way to pay for parking at Metro-operated garages and lots effective June 28, 2004. The decision prompted complaints that Metro was inconveniencing its many customers, including tourists and other infrequent users, who did not own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target. WMATA has since announced that it will make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.

== Participating systems ==
The following is a list of transit systems that accept the SmarTrip card for payment. The Maryland Transit Administration&#x27;s CharmCard uses a compatible payment system from the same manufacturer. A reciprocity agreement allows patrons to use either payment card to travel on any of the participating systems throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. However, digital SmarTrip cards stored in Apple Wallet will not work on any Baltimore MTA vehicle.
== Other area transportation ==
The following systems serve the Baltimore–Washington Area, but do not currently accept SmarTrip or CharmCard as payment

*Select routes &quot;do&quot; accept SmarTrip.

**SmarTrip can be used to purchase a paper or digital ticket in lieu of a credit or debit card through certain DC area employers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program.

***This service is free to all users and does not collect fares.

<doc id="791855" wikidata="Q6768392" url="?curid=791855" title="Mark Kingwell">
<text>Mark Gerald Kingwell (born March 1, 1963) is a Canadian philosopher, professor and former associate chair at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Department of Philosophy. Kingwell is a fellow of Trinity College. He specialises in theories of politics and culture. He writes widely in both scholarly and mainstream venues, and addresses specific topics in social justice, discourse ethics, aesthetics, film theory, philosophy of architecture and urbanism, philosophy of technology, and cultural theory.

==Early life and education==
Kingwell was born in Toronto but grew up on air force bases across Canada, including the Maritimes and Manitoba, where he graduated from St. Paul&#x27;s High School in Winnipeg in 1980. He studied philosophy, English, and political science at the University of Toronto, editing &quot;The Varsity&quot; through 1983 to 1984 and the &quot;University of Toronto Review&quot; in 1984-85. He received his BA degree from St. Michael&#x27;s College with High Distinction in 1985; his MLitt degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1987 supervised by R. W.

<text>The Seebeck coefficient (also known as thermopower, thermoelectric power, and thermoelectric sensitivity) of a material is a measure of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across that material, as induced by the Seebeck effect. The SI unit of the Seebeck coefficient is volts per kelvin (V/K), although it is more often given in microvolts per kelvin (μV/K).

The use of materials with a high Seebeck coefficient is one of many important factors for the efficient behaviour of thermoelectric generators and thermoelectric coolers. More information about high-performance thermoelectric materials can be found in the Thermoelectric materials article. In thermocouples the Seebeck effect is used to measure temperatures, and for accuracy it is desirable to use materials with a Seebeck coefficient that is stable over time.

Physically, the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient can be approximately understood as being given by the entropy per unit charge carried by electrical currents in the material. It may be positive or negative. In conductors that can be understood in terms of independently moving, nearly-free charge carriers, the Seebeck coefficient is negative for negatively charged carriers (such as electrons), and positive for positively charged carriers (such as electron holes).

==Definition==

One way to define the Seebeck coefficient is the voltage built up when a small temperature gradient is applied to a material, and when the material has come to a steady state where the current density is zero everywhere. If the temperature difference Δ&quot;T&quot; between the two ends of a material is small, then the Seebeck coefficient of a material is defined as:
:formula_1
where Δ&quot;V&quot; is the thermoelectric voltage seen at the terminals. (See below for more on the signs of Δ&quot;V&quot; and Δ&quot;T&quot;.)

Note that the voltage shift expressed by the Seebeck effect cannot be measured directly, since the measured voltage (by attaching a voltmeter) contains an additional voltage contribution, due to the temperature gradient and Seebeck effect in the measurement leads. The voltmeter voltage is always dependent on &quot;relative&quot; Seebeck coefficients among the various materials involved.

Most generally and technically, the Seebeck coefficient is defined in terms of the portion of electric current driven by temperature gradients, as in the vector differential equation
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the current density, formula_4 is the electrical conductivity, formula_5 is the voltage gradient, and formula_6 is the temperature gradient. The zero-current, steady state special case described above has formula_7, which implies that the two electrical conductivity terms have cancelled out and so formula_8

===Sign convention===

The sign is made explicit in the following expression:
:formula_9
Thus, if &quot;S&quot; is positive, the end with the higher temperature has the lower voltage, and vice versa. The voltage gradient in the material will point against the temperature gradient.

The Seebeck effect is generally dominated by the contribution from charge carrier diffusion (see below) which tends to push charge carriers towards the cold side of the material until a compensating voltage has built up. As a result, in p-type semiconductors (which have only positive mobile charges, electron holes), &quot;S&quot; is positive. Likewise, in n-type semiconductors (which have only negative mobile charges, electrons), &quot;S&quot; is negative. 
In most conductors, however, the charge carriers exhibit both hole-like and electron-like behaviour and the sign of &quot;S&quot; usually depends on which of them predominates.

===Relationship to other thermoelectric coefficients===

According to the second Thomson relation (which holds for all non-magnetic materials in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field), the Seebeck coefficient is related to the Peltier coefficient formula_10 by the exact relation
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the thermodynamic temperature.

According to the first Thomson relation and under the same assumptions about magnetism, the Seebeck coefficient is related to the Thomson coefficient formula_13 by
:formula_14
The constant of integration is such that formula_15 at absolute zero, as required by Nernst&#x27;s theorem.

==Measurement==

===Relative Seebeck coefficient===

In practice the absolute Seebeck coefficient is difficult to measure directly, since the voltage output of a thermoelectric circuit, as measured by a voltmeter, only depends on &quot;differences&quot; of Seebeck coefficients. This is because electrodes attached to a voltmeter must be placed onto the material in order to measure the thermoelectric voltage. The temperature gradient then also typically induces a thermoelectric voltage across one leg of the measurement electrodes. Therefore, the measured Seebeck coefficient is a contribution from the Seebeck coefficient of the material of interest and the material of the measurement electrodes. This arrangement of two materials is usually called a thermocouple.

The measured Seebeck coefficient is then a contribution from both and can be written as:

:formula_16

===Absolute Seebeck coefficient===

Although only relative Seebeck coefficients are important for externally measured voltages, the absolute Seebeck coefficient can be important for other effects where voltage is measured indirectly. Determination of the absolute Seebeck coefficient therefore requires more complicated techniques and is more difficult, but such measurements have been performed on standard materials. These measurements only had to be performed once for all time, and for all materials; for any other material, the absolute Seebeck coefficient can be obtained by performing a relative Seebeck coefficient measurement against a standard material.

A measurement of the Thomson coefficient formula_17, which expresses the strength of the Thomson effect, can be used to yield the absolute Seebeck coefficient through the relation: formula_18, provided that formula_17 is measured down to absolute zero. The reason this works is that formula_20 is expected to decrease to zero as the temperature is brought to zero—a consequence of Nernst&#x27;s theorem. Such a measurement based on the integration of formula_21 was published in 1932, though it relied on the interpolation of the Thomson coefficient in certain regions of temperature.

Superconductors have zero Seebeck coefficient, as mentioned below. By making one of the wires in a thermocouple superconducting, it is possible to get a direct measurement of the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the other wire, since it alone determines the measured voltage from the entire thermocouple. A publication in 1958 used this technique to measure the absolute Seebeck coefficient of lead between 7.2 K and 18 K, thereby filling in an important gap in the previous 1932 experiment mentioned above.

The combination of the superconductor-thermocouple technique up to 18 K, with the Thomson-coefficient-integration technique above 18 K, allowed determination of the absolute Seebeck coefficient of lead up to room temperature. By proxy, these measurements led to the determination of absolute Seebeck coefficients for &quot;all materials&quot;, even up to higher temperatures, by a combination of Thomson coefficient integrations and thermocouple circuits.

The difficulty of these measurements, and the rarity of reproducing experiments, lends some degree of uncertainty to the absolute thermoelectric scale thus obtained. In particular, the 1932 measurements may have incorrectly measured the Thomson coefficient over the range 20 K to 50 K. Since nearly all subsequent publications relied on those measurements, this would mean that all of the commonly used values of absolute Seebeck coefficient (including those shown in the figures) are too low by about 0.3 μV/K, for all temperatures above 50 K.

==Seebeck coefficients for some common materials==

In the table below are Seebeck coefficients at room temperature for some common, nonexotic materials, measured relative to platinum.
The Seebeck coefficient of platinum itself is approximately −5 μV/K at room temperature, and so the values listed below should be compensated accordingly. For example, the Seebeck coefficients of Cu, Ag, Au are 1.5 μV/K, and of Al −1.5 μV/K. The Seebeck coefficient of semiconductors very much depends on doping, with generally positive values for p doped materials and negative values for n doping.

==Physical factors that determine the Seebeck coefficient==

A material&#x27;s temperature, crystal structure, and impurities influence the value of thermoelectric coefficients. The Seebeck effect can be attributed to two things: charge-carrier diffusion and phonon drag.

=== Charge carrier diffusion ===

On a fundamental level, an applied voltage difference refers to a difference in the thermodynamic chemical potential of charge carriers, and the direction of the current under a voltage difference is determined by the universal thermodynamic process in which (given equal temperatures) particles flow from high chemical potential to low chemical potential. In other words, the direction of the current in Ohm&#x27;s law is determined via the thermodynamic arrow of time (the difference in chemical potential could be exploited to produce work, but is instead dissipated as heat which increases entropy). On the other hand, for the Seebeck effect not even the sign of the current can be predicted from thermodynamics, and so to understand the origin of the Seebeck coefficient it is necessary to understand the &quot;microscopic&quot; physics.

Charge carriers (such as thermally excited electrons) constantly diffuse around inside a conductive material. Due to thermal fluctuations, some of these charge carriers travel with a higher energy than average, and some with a lower energy. When no voltage differences or temperature differences are applied, the carrier diffusion perfectly balances out and so on average one sees no current: formula_22. A net current can be generated by applying a voltage difference (Ohm&#x27;s law), or by applying a temperature difference (Seebeck effect). To understand the microscopic origin of the thermoelectric effect, it is useful to first describe the microscopic mechanism of the normal Ohm&#x27;s law electrical conductance—to describe what determines the formula_4 in formula_24. Microscopically, what is happening in Ohm&#x27;s law is that higher energy levels have a higher concentration of carriers per state, on the side with higher chemical potential. For each interval of energy, the carriers tend to diffuse and spread into the area of device where there are fewer carriers per state of that energy. As they move, however, they occasionally scatter dissipatively, which re-randomizes their energy according to the local temperature and chemical potential. This dissipation empties out the carriers from these higher energy states, allowing more to diffuse in. The combination of diffusion and dissipation favours an overall drift of the charge carriers towards the side of the material where they have a lower chemical potential.

For the thermoelectric effect, now, consider the case of uniform voltage (uniform chemical potential) with a temperature gradient. In this case, at the hotter side of the material there is more variation in the energies of the charge carriers, compared to the colder side. This means that high energy levels have a higher carrier occupation per state on the hotter side, but also the hotter side has a &quot;lower&quot; occupation per state at lower energy levels. As before, the high-energy carriers diffuse away from the hot end, and produce entropy by drifting towards the cold end of the device. However, there is a competing process: at the same time low-energy carriers are drawn back towards the hot end of the device. Though these processes both generate entropy, they work against each other in terms of charge current, and so a net current only occurs if one of these drifts is stronger than the other. The net current is given by formula_25, where (as shown below) the thermoelectric coefficient formula_26 depends literally on how conductive high-energy carriers are, compared to low-energy carriers. The distinction may be due to a difference in rate of scattering, a difference in speeds, a difference in density of states, or a combination of these effects.

==== Mott formula ====

The processes described above apply in materials where each charge carrier sees an essentially static environment so that its motion can be described independently from other carriers, and independent of other dynamics (such as phonons). In particular, in electronic materials with weak electron-electron interactions, weak electron-phonon interactions, etc. it can be shown in general that the linear response conductance is
:formula_27
and the linear response thermoelectric coefficient is
:formula_28
where formula_29 is the energy-dependent conductivity, and formula_30 is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. These equations are known as the Mott relations, of Sir Nevill Francis Mott. The derivativeformula_31 is a function peaked around the chemical potential (Fermi level) formula_32 with a width of approximately formula_33. The energy-dependent conductivity (a quantity that cannot actually be directly measured — one only measures formula_34) is calculated as formula_35 where formula_36 is the electron diffusion constant and formula_37 is the electronic density of states (in general, both are functions of energy).

In materials with strong interactions, none of the above equations can be used since it is not possible to consider each charge carrier as a separate entity. The Wiedemann–Franz law can also be exactly derived using the non-interacting electron picture, and so in materials where the Wiedemann–Franz law fails (such as superconductors), the Mott relations also generally tend to fail.

The formulae above can be simplified in a couple of important limiting cases:

===== Mott formula in metals =====
In semimetals and metals, where transport only occurs near the Fermi level and formula_29 changes slowly in the range formula_39, one can perform a Sommerfeld expansion formula_40, which leads to
:formula_41
This expression is sometimes called &quot;the Mott formula&quot;, however it is much less general than Mott&#x27;s original formula expressed above.

In the free electron model with scattering, the value of formula_42 is of order formula_43, where formula_44 is the Fermi temperature, and so a typical value of the Seebeck coefficient in the Fermi gas is formula_45 (the prefactor varies somewhat depending on details such as dimensionality and scattering). In highly conductive metals the Fermi temperatures are typically around 104 – 105 K, and so it is understandable why their absolute Seebeck coefficients are only of order 1 – 10 μV/K at room temperature. Note that whereas the free electron model predicts a negative Seebeck coefficient, real metals actually have complicated band structures and may exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients (examples: Cu, Ag, Au).

The fraction formula_46 in semimetals is sometimes calculated from the measured derivative of formula_47 with respect to some energy shift induced by field effect. This is not necessarily correct and the estimate of formula_42 can be incorrect (by a factor of two or more), since the disorder potential depends on screening which also changes with field effect.

===== Mott formula in semiconductors =====

In semiconductors at low levels of doping, transport only occurs far away from the Fermi level. At low doping in the conduction band (where formula_49, where formula_50 is the minimum energy of the conduction band edge), one has formula_51. Approximating the conduction band levels&#x27; conductivity function as formula_52 for some constants formula_53 and formula_54,
:formula_55
whereas in the valence band when formula_56 and formula_57,
:formula_58
The values of formula_54 and formula_60 depend on material details; in bulk semiconductor these constants range between 1 and 3, the extremes corresponding to acoustic-mode lattice scattering and ionized-impurity scattering.
In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors either the conduction or valence band will dominate transport, and so one of the numbers above will give the measured values. In general however the semiconductor may also be intrinsic in which case the bands conduct in parallel, and so the measured values will be

:formula_61

This results in a crossover behaviour, as shown in the figure.
The highest Seebeck coefficient is obtained when the semiconductor is lightly doped, however a high Seebeck coefficient is not necessarily useful on its own. For thermoelectric power devices (coolers, generators) it is more important to maximize the thermoelectric power factor formula_62, or the thermoelectric figure of merit, and the optimum generally occurs at high doping levels.

=== Phonon drag ===

Phonons are not always in local thermal equilibrium; they move against the thermal gradient. They lose momentum by interacting with electrons (or other carriers) and imperfections in the crystal. If the phonon-electron interaction is predominant, the phonons will tend to push the electrons to one end of the material, hence losing momentum and contributing to the thermoelectric field. This contribution is most important in the temperature region where phonon-electron scattering is predominant. This happens for
:formula_63

where formula_64 is the Debye temperature. At lower temperatures there are fewer phonons available for drag, and at higher temperatures they tend to lose momentum in phonon-phonon scattering instead of phonon-electron scattering. At lower temperatures, material boundaries also play an increasing role as the phonons can travel significant distances. Practically speaking, phonon drag is an important effect in semiconductors near room temperature (even though well above formula_65), that is comparable in magnitude to the carrier-diffusion effect described in the previous section.

This region of the thermopower-versus-temperature function is highly variable under a magnetic field.

=== Relationship with entropy ===

The Seebeck coefficient of a material corresponds thermodynamically to the amount of entropy &quot;dragged along&quot; by the flow of charge inside a material; it is in some sense the entropy per unit charge in the material.

<doc id="791882" wikidata="Q1815560" url="?curid=791882" title="Calzone">
<text>Calzone is an Italian oven-baked turnover. A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and stuffed with prosciutto or salami, mozzarella or ricotta, and Parmesan or pecorino, as well as an egg. Different regional variations in or on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings. The term usually applies to an oven-baked turnover rather than a fried pastry (i.e. panzerotti), although calzones and panzerotti are often mistaken for each other.

Stromboli, an Italian-American pizza turnover, is similar to calzone, and the two are sometimes confused. Unlike strombolis, which are generally rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape, calzones are always folded into a crescent shape, and typically do not contain tomato sauce inside.

==In Italy==
Sandwich-sized calzones are often sold at Italian lunch counters or by street vendors, because they are easy to eat while standing or walking. Fried versions of the calzone are typically filled with tomato and mozzarella; these are made in Apulia and are called &quot;panzerotti&quot;. 

In Basilicata, a variety of calzone is known as &quot;pastizz&quot; or &quot;u&#x27; pastizz &#x27;rtunnar&quot;, which originated between the 18th and 19th century. Pork (or, more rarely, goat meat), eggs, and cheese are main ingredients for the filling.

<text>Mont-Saint-Hilaire () is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore of southeastern Quebec, Canada, on the Richelieu River in the Regional County Municipality of La Vallée-du-Richelieu. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 18,859. The city is named after the Mont Saint-Hilaire.

A significant deposit of the semi-precious mineral sodalite is located near Mont-Saint-Hilaire.

==History==

Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville was granted the seignory of the region in 1694. By 1745 a mountain village had been formed with the first chapel being built in 1798 near the Richelieu River. Nearly twenty years later, in 1822, a ferry operating between Beloeil and Mont-Saint-Hilaire came into service. A bridge, enabling Beloeil and St. Hilaire to be connected by rail, was built in 1848 by the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway. The Campbell family, owners of the mountain after that of Rouville, sold the mountain to a British officer, Brigadier-General Andrew Gault, in whose ownership it remained for 45 years. Gault then bequeathed the mountain to McGill University before his death in 1958.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mont-Saint-Hilaire had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Attractions==

*The Gault Nature Reserve on Mont Saint-Hilaire includes over a thousand hectares of primeval forest. Owned by McGill University, the nature reserve is used for research and recreation.
*The Museum of Fine Arts (Le Musée des beaux-arts) of Mont-Saint-Hilaire is the major art museum on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. It was founded in 1993 to promote the work of regional artists Jordi Bonet, Paul-Émile Borduas and Ozias Leduc. Exhibitions also feature art from the area, such as &quot;Saint-Hilaire et les Automatistes&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Leduc, Borduas et le paysage de Saint-Hilaire&quot; in 2008, as well as other Quebec artists such as Jean-Paul Lemieux and Nancy Petry.

==Infrastructure==
Mont-Saint-Hilaire is served by the Mont-Saint-Hilaire commuter rail station on the Réseau de transport métropolitain&#x27;s (RTM) Mont-Saint-Hilaire line. Local bus service is provided by the RTM&#x27;s Vallée du Richelieu sector.

In 1864, Canada&#x27;s worst rail disaster occurred here when a passenger train passed a red signal and fell off an open swing bridge into the Richelieu River, killing around 99 people.

==Education==

The town is home to 4 primary schools: Au-fil-de-l&#x27;eau (659 pupils), de l&#x27;Aquarelle (354 pupils) and de la Pommeraie (383 pupils) and Paul-Émile-Borduas. There are also 2 secondary schools, including Ozias-Leduc, with 1,480 students and Collège Saint-Hilaire, a private high school that receives students from the region.

The South Shore Protestant Regional School Board previously served the municipality.

<doc id="791900" wikidata="Q5509489" url="?curid=791900" title="Furcadia">
<text>Furcadia is a free-to-play MMOSG/MMORPG or graphical MUD, set in a fantasy world inhabited by magical creatures. The game is based on user-created content with emphasis on world building tools, exploring, socializing, and free-form roleplaying. &quot;Furcadia&quot; hosts a large volunteer program called the Beekin Helpers, allowing players to help with community moderation, welcoming new players, handling in-game technical support, running in game events, creating art for the game itself, accessing and updating the game&#x27;s website, and bug hunting. &quot;Furcadia&quot; holds the Guinness World Records title for the longest continuously running social MMORPG and, in addition to being one of the first games to heavily encourage modding and let users build virtual worlds for themselves, it was also one of the first freemium online games. In 2008, &quot;Furcadia&quot; was reported as having over 60,000 players.

==Gameplay==
=== Characters ===
The character, or avatar on &quot;Furcadia&quot; can be set to one of 11 free species, including both humans, insects, and anthropomorphic animals. Players can choose between one of three genders: male, female, and unspecified. These genders modify the default portrait, butler (the large character art), and specitags, icons seen to the left of players&#x27; names in chat.

===Customization===
Players can customize their avatars by choosing colors from a palette. These colors are shown on the butler, walkabout, and portrait. The walkabout has a walking animation with the ability to stand, sit, or lie down. There are default portraits for each avatar, however, players may upload a 95x95 custom portrait for a small fee. 22 Custom avatars (non-gendered) may be added and used inside private dreams, for free.

Each character can also have a written description, which can include character details, external links to websites, or internal links to private dreams. Some players choose to link to third-party websites to extend their descriptions beyond the character-limit the standard Furcadia description allows.

===Dreams===
The primary focus of &quot;Furcadia&quot; is user-generated content. To this end, the &quot;Furcadia&quot; game download includes an art editor, a map creating program, a skin editor, and a script editor. Users are encouraged to create their own virtual worlds, called Dreams, using these free tools. These worlds can be uploaded to the &quot;Furcadia&quot; server for free and used for a variety of purposes, examples being text based role playing, a place to hang out with friends, or playing multiplayer games and quests with other users, etc. Dreams remain open to the public area in which they are uploaded, so long as it is inhabited, and, if unoccupied, it is eventually unloaded automatically.

While there are several types of dreams that are popular, users continue to create new things with the tools they are given. &quot;Furcadia&quot; hosts a variety of roleplaying dreams, ranging from strict-continuity roleplay (in which the dream is its own independent world) to persona play. Roleplaying dreams also come in a number of different forms, ranging from feral (wild animal) to furre (anthropomorphic animal) to human. Many dreams revolve around fantasy plots and themes, based on popular books, television programs, ancient mythology, or original creations of &quot;Furcadia&quot; players.

&quot;Furcadia&quot; itself is basically made up of several dreams, the ones made by its users and the main maps.

===Patches===
Almost all of the 6,000+ default art files shown in &quot;Furcadia&quot; can be patched over and displayed in a Dream, including the skin, buttons, avatars, items, walls, effects, lighting, ambience, portals, and floors. Additional art may be added to a Dream in file types ending with &#x27;e&#x27;, such as iteme, floore, etc., which does not overwrite the default art. Much user created patch art is available for download via third party websites. Dreams can also include the use of audio files in the WMA, Ogg, MOD, S3M, WAV and MIDI (.mid) formats.

===Scripting===
Players may add interactivity to dreams chiefly through a custom scripting language known as DragonSpeak, or &quot;DS&quot;. DragonSpeak commands may be triggered by in-game actions or by custom buttons displayed over the game interface. Other custom scripting tools include PhoenixSpeak, which is used to store information to a permanent database, and an animation scripting language called KitterSpeak.

These scripting languages enable players to script actions ranging from the simple, like opening a door, to the more complex, such as a complete game of chess or laser-tag.

Dream owners are allowed to make and use bots to accomplish things that DragonSpeak cannot, but these are not officially supported by &quot;Furcadia&quot;.

====Dream standards====
Although &quot;Furcadia&quot; itself is unrated, individual dreams may specify a standard which details what kind of behavior, language, and content may be allowed. Before March 2007, &quot;Furcadia&quot; used a rating system akin to the MPAA film rating system. Since March 2007, &quot;Furcadia&quot; uses its own Dream standards system which allows users to define exactly what kind of behavior should be allowed on a per-dream basis. The Dream standards are based on age groups, ranging from Everyone8+ to Adult Only, with specific behavior, language, and content restrictions. Some main maps—FurN and Hawthorn (previously Haven/New Haven)—immediately block the user from entering the main map if they are not within the specified age group and parental controls are enabled.

==Development==

David Shapiro (AKA Dr. Cat), a former employee of Origin Systems, launched &quot;&quot; as one of the Internet&#x27;s first graphics-based multi-user dungeons (MUDs) in 1994. Unlike other graphical video games, &quot;DragonSpires&quot; focused on social relationships and peaceable community-building over combat and violence. The game was free to access. The novelty of the game interested multiple venture capital firms as well as Origin. The developers remade the title as &quot;Furcadia&quot;.

First opened to the public on December 16, 1996, &quot;Furcadia&quot; is developed by Dragon&#x27;s Eye Productions, Inc (DEP) and later, Catnip Studios. At its public release, &quot;Furcadia&quot; featured a graphical improvement: art with a 256 color VGA palette. At the time, &quot;Furcadia&quot; was never intended to be an exclusively &#x27;furry&#x27; game.

New support for 24-bit non-remappable portraits (the first art to extend beyond 256 colors), and Windows Vista support were implemented in the April 6, 2007 &quot;Kitterwing Edition.&quot; On December 16, 2006, &quot;Furcadia&quot; became the first-ever MMORPG to celebrate ten years of continual service.

&quot;Furcadia&quot; was originally designed and programmed by David Shapiro (also known as &quot;Dr. Cat&quot;, or &quot;Felorin&quot; in-game) and &#x27;Manda (known as &quot;Talzhemir&quot; in-game). Additional people have since been included as part owners for their work: game executive producer Emerald Kaiten Catz (known as &quot;Emerald Flame&quot;), who coordinates new development on the game, as well as who developed (and still coordinates) the Beekin volunteers project, Aleksi Asikainen (known as &quot;Fox&quot;, or &quot;sanctimonious&quot;), who created the game&#x27;s editors and was involved in coding the client / server, though he no longer works for &quot;Furcadia&quot;, Ben Jans (known as &quot;Gar&quot;), the game&#x27;s design director, and Michael Vondung (known as &quot;Cironir&quot;), who manages the community. The other DEP staff are involved with the game&#x27;s art and programming development, as well as community affairs.

The iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch client was released on July 19, 2010, though it is no longer available for download.

In 2012 &quot;Furcadia&quot; launched a Kickstarter campaign to renovate the entire game in a series of updates called The Second Dreaming. This campaign was successful, and raised more than $100,000.

In 2016, &quot;Furcadia&quot; released &quot;The Second Dreaming Part 1&quot;, which added new 32bit world building tools, character enhancements, a web based character creator and editor, and other massive updates to the graphics engine.

<text>A television special (often TV special, or rarely television spectacular) is a standalone television show which may also temporarily interrupt episodic programming normally scheduled for a given time slot. Some specials provide a full range of entertainment and informational value available via the television medium (news, drama, comedy, variety, cultural), in various formats (live television, documentary, studio production, animation, film), and in any viewing lengths (short films, feature films, miniseries, telethons).
==Examples==
The types of shows described as television specials include:

*One-time comedy shows
*Extended episodes of TV shows.
*Adaptations of operas, Broadway plays, and other musicals
*Celebrity profiles, interviews, or tribute specials
*Seasonal programs or parades: Christmas television specials, Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, New Year&#x27;s Eve
*Theatrical films and &quot;made-for-TV&quot; movies
*Animated cartoons (shorts, more than two-part episodes)
*Irregular sports events: Olympic Games, Super Bowl
*Beauty pageants: Miss America, Miss Universe
*Award shows: Academy Awards
*Religious specials: Catholic Church&#x27;s Holy Year, Christmas, Holy Masses, New Year, Holy Masses, Holy Week Holy Masses, Urbi et Orbi Blessings at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Vatican City, Rome, Lazio, Italy and Other&#x27;s, etc.
*Fundraising campaigns (telethons, pledge drives)
*On-going breaking news or event coverage such as the funeral of a major public figure or the wedding of a member of a royal family
*Promotional previews of regularly scheduled programming (such as Saturday morning preview specials)

==History==
The production of early television shows was very expensive, with few guarantees of public success, and ongoing (weekly) shows typically required a single, major sponsor to operate. As such, a good deal of programming was one-off shows, accommodating smaller sponsors and not requiring a loyal audience following. As the industry matured, this trend reversed; by the 1950s, most networks aimed to provide stable, routine, and proven content to their audiences. Television executives, such as CBS president James Aubrey, sought to avoid any disruption in viewing habits which might cause viewers to move to another network. These weekly series, though, typically became too expensive for any single sponsor, so stand-alone shows offered a way to continue accommodating the single-sponsor practice, leading to shows like &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; (1951, sponsored by Hallmark Cards as part of the &quot;Hallmark Television Playhouse&quot;) and the &quot;Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot; (1953, a two-hour variety show simulcast on both CBS and NBC).

In 1954, NBC president Sylvester Weaver pioneered an innovative style of programming which he called &quot;spectaculars&quot;. These stand-alone broadcasts, usually 90 minutes in length, were designed to attract large, new audiences and bring prestige to the network. The spectaculars aired on three nights every fourth week - a major gamble because it controversially broke up viewer routines and risked stable weekly sponsorship deals.

To address this, Weaver used his &quot;magazine&quot; style which involved selling segments of each show to a different sponsor, a practice which would evolve into the modern &quot;commercial&quot;. The three initial spectacular blocks were &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; (Sundays, produced by Albert McCleery), &quot;Producer&#x27;s Showcase&quot; (Mondays, produced by Fred Coe), &quot;Max Liebman Presents&quot; (Saturdays, produced by Max Liebman). In time, the term &quot;spectacular&quot; was seen as hyperbolic, and so led to the more modern and modest term, &quot;special&quot;. Weaver&#x27;s strategy was not as successful as CBS&#x27;s predictably scheduled and prefilmed programs, and he was fired in 1956.

In the 1960s, multi-part specials, which aired over several days in a week or on the same day for several weeks, evolved from this format, though these were more commonly called miniseries. The term &quot;TV special&quot; formerly applied more to dramas or musicals presented live or on videotape (such as &quot;Peter Pan&quot;) than to filmed presentations especially made for television, which were (and still are) referred to as made-for-TV movies.

In the era before cable and home video, television audiences often had to wait an entire year or more to see a special program or film that had a great impact on first viewing. Today, streaming media such as video on demand and streaming television, often makes it possible for viewers to watch a television special again almost immediately after it is aired, and home video—which has largely given way to digital downloads—makes it possible for the general public to own copies of television specials and films.

<text>The Calgary Tower is a free standing observation tower in the downtown core of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Originally called the Husky Tower, it was conceived as a joint venture between Marathon Realty Company Limited and Husky Oil as part of an urban renewal plan and to celebrate Canada&#x27;s centennial of 1967. The tower was built at a cost of and weighs approximately 10,884 tonnes, of which 60% is below ground. It opened to the public on June 30, 1968, as the tallest structure in Calgary, and the tallest in Canada outside Toronto. It was renamed the Calgary Tower in 1971.

The building is a founding member of the World Federation of Great Towers.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
The project was originally conceived as a joint venture by Marathon Realty (the real estate subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway) and Husky Oil for their new head offices in Calgary. They proposed building the tower both to honour Canada&#x27;s centennial year of 1967 and to encourage urban renewal and growth of downtown Calgary. The structure was designed by A. Dale and Associates, and was designed to withstand earthquakes and winds of up to .

The urban renewal project was announced to the public on December 10, 1965, and consisted of a transport terminal, hotel, parking, office facility and a &quot;restaurant-observation tower&quot;. The chosen site housed Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Calgary passenger station which was demolished a year after the announcement to make way for the development. The provincial government reviewed the tower proposal for consideration as a publicly funded centennial project, but Public Works Minister Frederick C. Colborne recommended against the use of public funds for the project. The concept of a centennial tower was originally proposed for Edmonton, but the project was opposed by residents near the chosen site. Former Calgary Mayor Grant MacEwan asked the provincial government to move the project to Calgary, until Marathon and Husky decided to build the project independent of public funds. The plan for the tower continued to change as construction delays occurred and the planned height rose from .

Construction began on February 19, 1967, and completed in 15 months at a cost of $3.5 million. The column of the tower was built from an unprecedented continual pour of concrete. Pouring began May 15, 1967, and was completed 24 days later at an average growth of per day, a rate that was praised by industry officials as an &quot;amazing feat of technical and physical workmanship&quot;.

Upon completion, the Husky Tower stood tall and was the tallest structure of its type in North America. It dominated the Calgary skyline, standing well over twice the height of the previous tallest structure in the city, Elveden House. Developers deliberately misled the public, claiming the tower would stand , in the hopes of preventing competing developers from surpassing the Husky Tower&#x27;s height record. Shortly after officials in San Antonio, Texas, attempted to claim the record in announcing the completion of the Tower of the Americas, developers revealed the Husky Tower&#x27;s true height.

The Husky Tower officially opened on June 28–30, 1968, in three separate ceremonies. The observation level featured a lounge/restaurant called the &quot;Hitching Post&quot;.

===Later history===

Marathon Realty acquired a controlling interest in the tower in 1970. The structure was formally renamed the Calgary Tower on November 1, 1971, as a tribute to the citizens of the city. It is still called the Husky Tower by airport officials, however, to distinguish it from the tower at the Calgary International Airport.

The Petro-Canada Centre&#x27;s west tower overtook the Calgary Tower as the tallest structure in Calgary in 1983.

The tower underwent significant renovations between 1987 and 1990. The addition of a souvenir shop and a revolving restaurant were part of a $2.4 million refurbishment of the upper levels of the tower. In 1990 a glass rotunda to serve as the new lobby was added.

A natural gas-fired cauldron was constructed at the top of the tower by Canadian Western Natural Gas in October 1987 as a gift to celebrate the 1988 Winter Olympics. The torch, which consumes per hour, was first lit on February 13, 1988, when the Games opened, and burned 24 hours a day throughout. It continues to be reignited for various special events, including Canada Day.

The tower was a founding member of the World Federation of Great Towers in 1989 along with the Eiffel Tower, among others. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1993, a year in which it topped 500,000 visitors for the first time.

A glass floor extension was constructed on the north side of the tower&#x27;s observation deck and opened on June 24, 2005. When standing on the glass, one can look straight down on 9th Avenue South and Centre Street.

An LED, multicolour exterior lighting system was added and was first tested on August 1, 2014. 12 lights were added to the crown and 24 to the exterior floor. Each light has been programmed to be able to create over 16.5 million combinations of colour and lighting effects. It has been used since October 8, 2014, becoming a more noticeable part of the city skyline at night.

==Architecture==

The Calgary tower features a revolving restaurant, Sky 360. The restaurant does a complete rotation every 45 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes in the evening. The base of the tower is connected through the Plus 15 skyway network to One Palliser Square, Fairmont Palliser Hotel and EnCana Place. Stairs to the observation deck are not opened to the public, but have been used on occasions for publicity, as well as for an annual charity stair-climbing race. There are 802 steps.

The Vertigo Theatre, founded in 1976 originally as Pleiades Theatre, is at the base of the tower. They have been entertaining the city from their location in the Calgary Tower since 2003, providing a full season of plays in the mystery genre, for adult and youth audiences.

The tower also features a carillon that was presented to the city by the local Dutch community in 1975 as part of the city&#x27;s centennial celebrations. It was played daily at noon until removed in 1987 for storage. The carillon has since been refurbished and restored to operation.

<doc id="791931" wikidata="Q517070" url="?curid=791931" title="Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 10 in E♭ major is a hypothetical work, assembled in 1988 by Barry Cooper from Beethoven&#x27;s fragmentary sketches for the first movement. All the sketches assembled were clearly intended for the same symphony, which would have followed the Ninth, since they appear together in several small groups, and there is consensus that Beethoven did intend to compose another symphony. Cooper&#x27;s score was first performed at a concert given in 1988 by the Royal Philharmonic Society, London, to whom Beethoven himself had offered the new symphony in 1827. The score is published by Universal Edition, Vienna, and appeared in a new edition in 2013.
In 2019, artificial intelligence was used to reconstruct the third and fourth movements of the symphony, which premiered 9 October 2021, titled &quot;Beethoven X: The AI Project&quot;.

==Background==

After completing the Ninth Symphony in 1824, Beethoven devoted his energies largely to composing his late string quartets, although there are contemporary references to some work on a symphony (e.g. in his letter of 18 March 1827); allegedly he played a movement of this piece on the piano for his friend Karl Holz, whose description of what he heard matches the sketches identified by Cooper. Cooper claimed that he found over 250 measures of sketches for the first movement, which he wove together to form the first movement, keeping as close as he could to Beethoven&#x27;s compositional method and sketching processes. Cooper&#x27;s reconstruction of the first movement consists of an Andante in E major enclosing a central Allegro in C minor. Cooper claimed to have also found sketches for a Scherzo which he used as a third movement and other later movements, but he deemed them not extensive or developed enough to be assembled into a performing version.

There are a few references to this work in Beethoven&#x27;s correspondence.

Earlier, in 1814 to 1815, Beethoven also began sketches for his 6th piano concerto in D major.

==Recordings==
Two recordings of Cooper&#x27;s reconstruction of the first movement of the symphony were released in 1988, one conducted by Morris and the other by Walter Weller. The Morris recording was also released in 1988 on a disc that included the music and an audio recording of a lecture titled &quot;The story of Beethoven&#x27;s tenth symphony&quot;, by Barry Cooper.

==Unrelated depictions==
An imaginary story of the discovery of Beethoven&#x27;s 10th symphony was depicted by Sue Latham in her novel &quot;The Haunted House Symphony&quot;. A similar concept by Richard Kluger in his novel &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Tenth&quot;, published in 2018, identifies many of the concerns and problems that might follow from the discovery of a lost symphony. Thomas Hauser&#x27;s 1984 suspense novel &quot;The Beethoven Conspiracy&quot; depicts the 10th symphony being secretly reassembled and performed.

Beethoven&#x27;s 10th symphony plays a large plot role in &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot;, an album by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

NPR ran a story on the discovery of Beethoven&#x27;s 10th Symphony on April Fools&#x27; Day 2012.

On the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode &quot;The Dr. Denker Story&quot;, Dr. Denker, played by Theodore Bikel, leads a children&#x27;s &quot;orchestra&quot; in what he refers to as &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 10th Symphony&quot;.

&quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Tenth&quot; is a play by Peter Ustinov. It was first staged on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre in April 1984 under the direction of Robert Chetwyn.

== Brahms First Symphony reference ==
Johannes Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony is sometimes referred to as &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Tenth Symphony&quot;, after a remark by von Bülow.
Both Brahms&#x27; first symphony and Cooper&#x27;s assembly of Beethoven&#x27;s sketches for the tenth feature C-minor  s.

<doc id="791943" wikidata="Q598887" url="?curid=791943" title="French Constitution of 1793">
<text>The Constitution of 1793 (), also known as the Constitution of the Year I or the Montagnard Constitution, was the second constitution ratified for use during the French Revolution under the First Republic. Designed by the Montagnards, principally Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Saint-Just, it was intended to replace the constitutional monarchy of 1791 and the Girondin constitutional project. With sweeping plans for democratization and wealth redistribution, the new document promised a significant departure from the relatively moderate goals of the Revolution in previous years.

The Constitution&#x27;s radical provisions were never implemented, and the government placed a moratorium upon it, ostensibly because of the need to employ emergency war powers during the French Revolutionary War. Those same emergency powers would permit the Committee of Public Safety to conduct the Reign of Terror, and when that period of violent political combat was over, the constitution was invalidated by its association with the defeated Robespierre. In the Thermidorian Reaction, it was discarded in favor of a more conservative document, the Constitution of 1795.

==History==

On 11 December 1792 Brissot, Pétion de Villeneuve, Marquis de Condorcet, Vergniaud, Gensonné, Th. Payne, Sieyès, Barère and Danton were commissioned to prepare a new constitution. The first six people were Girondins and enemies of Robespierre. On 19 December Barère presented their first report. On 15 February 1793 they presented a draft in the convention. On 27 February Robespierre invited the Jacobins to examine the draft. On 15–17 April the Convention discussed the Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1793, a French political document that preceded that country&#x27;s first republican constitution. On 19 April Robespierre opposed article 7. On 22 April the Convention discussed article 29: the right of resistance. On 24 April Robespierre proposed a few important changes on property. On 27 April Robespierre read the Declaration in the Jacobin Club.

==Adoption==
On 2 June 1793 after an insurrection and the fall of the Girondins the National Convention chose Louis Saint-Just and several other deputies to serve on a committee that would draft a new governmental system for the recently established Republic. The new constitution was intended to supersede the Constitution of 1791, which had been based on principles of constitutional monarchy that were now obsolete after the execution of King Louis XVI. The draftsmen were also placed on the elite Committee of Public Safety to maximize their resources. The Convention deemed their work to be of supreme importance, to be completed &quot;in the shortest possible time.&quot;

The work took eight days. A complete constitutional document was submitted to the convention on 10 June 1793. It was subsequently accepted by that body on 24 June and put to a public referendum. Employing universal male suffrage, the vote was a resounding popular victory for the new constitution, which received the approval of 1,784,377 out of approximately 1,800,000 voters.

The Constitution expanded upon the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, to which it added several rights: it proclaimed the superiority of popular sovereignty over national sovereignty. It added several new economic and social rights, including right of association, right to work and public assistance, right to public education, right of rebellion (and duty to rebel when the government violates the right of the people), all written into what is known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793.

==Contents==
Sections 1 through 6 spelled out exactly who should be treated as a French Citizen and under what conditions citizenship could be revoked. All males over the age of 21 who worked, owned land or other property in France, lived in France for over a year, or had family ties to a French person, or those specifically named by the legislative body would be considered citizens. Citizens sentenced to corporal or dishonourable punishment, or who had accepted offices or favors &quot;which do not proceed from a democratic government&quot; would lose their citizenship, which could be suspended if you were under investigation or being held in contempt of court.

Sections 7 through 44 specified the sovereign powers of the People, the Primary Assemblies, the National Representation, of the Electoral Assemblies, and of the Legislative Body. The Primary Assemblies were to comprise between 200 and 600 people, each representing an individual canton, who would vote to accept laws proposed by the Legislative Body, select deputies to the National Representation, and select electors to the Electoral Assemblies. The Constitution made explicit that representation would only be determined by population, not by groups (as in the Estates-General, in which each Estate had its separate representation). In the case of a tied vote in the National Representation, the oldest member would supply the tie-breaking vote.

Sections 45 to 52 laid out specific procedures to be followed by the Legislative Body, specifying a quorum of 200 members.

Sections 53 to 55 specified what issues are matters of law, while 56 through 61 establish the path for a bill to become a law. After being drafted and approved by the Legislative Body, the law would be considered a &quot;proposed law&quot; and voted on by all of the communes of France. No debate was to occur until 2 weeks after this distribution, and the bill would become law provided that no more than 1/10ths of the communes voted to voice objection to the law.

Sections 62 to 74 dealt with the Executive Power, which was to be placed in the hands of a 24-member executive council appointed by the Electoral Assembly. These members were to appoint agents to high administrative offices of the Republic.

The Constitution prescribed the relationship between the Executive Council and the Legislative Body, the governing of the Municipalities. It also established the conduct of the Civil Justice System, mandating that arbitrators be elected and that citizens could select arbitrators for their case, and of the Criminal Justice System, mandating trial by jury and representation for the accused. It specified that no citizen would be exempt from taxation and established regulations for military leadership and conduct and foreign relations.

Article 109 stated: &quot;All Frenchmen are soldiers; all shall be exercised in the use of arms.&quot; From the moment of its acceptance, it was made meaningless, first by the Convention itself, which had been charged to dissolve itself on completion of the document, then by the construction of the working institutions of the Terror. Condorcet, the main author of the first draft, was accused of federalism and had to go into hiding in early July.

The Constitution declared that France was a &quot;friend and ally of free nations&quot;, would not interfere with the government of other nations and would harbor any refugees from &quot;nations ruled by tyrants&quot;. It also forbade the establishment of peace with an enemy that occupied French territory.

Finally, it guaranteed the right to equality, liberty, security, property, the public debt, free exercise of religion, general instruction, public assistance, the absolute liberty of the press, the right of petition, the right to hold popular assemblies, and the &quot;enjoyment of all the Rights of man&quot;. It declared the Republic&#x27;s respect for &quot;loyalty, courage, age, filial love, and misfortune&quot;. Illegitimate children were recognized.

On 4 August the French Constitution of 1793 passed through the Convention. At the end of August rebellious Marseille, Bordeaux and Lyon had not accepted the new Constitution. According to French historian Soboul, Robespierre was against the implementation before the rebellious cantons had accepted it. By mid-September the Jacobin Club suggested that the Constitution should not be published, on the argument that general will was missing, although an overwhelming majority favoured it.

==Suspension==
In light of France&#x27;s internal and external conflicts, the National Convention found sufficient reason to maintain itself as the effective national government, operating in permanent session under emergency powers, until peace was achieved, and postponed the Constitution&#x27;s implementation. Though the Constitution was overwhelmingly popular and its drafting and ratification buoyed popular support for the Montagnards, the convention set it aside indefinitely on 10 October 1793 and declared a &quot;Revolutionary Government&quot; until a future peace. The ensuing Reign of Terror culminated in the disgrace and execution of Robespierre and Saint-Just in 1794. The Thermidorian Reaction shunned the Montagnard Constitution and eventually supplanted it by the Constitution of 1795, which established the Directory.

==Legacy==
The revolutionaries of 1848 were inspired by this constitution, and after 1870 it passed into the ideology of the Third Republic as well. The document represents a fundamental and historic shift in political priorities, one which contributed much to later democratic institutions and developments.

<text>The Saanich or W̱sáneć (, , &quot;Xwsenəč&quot;) are indigenous nations from the north coast of the Gulf and San Juan Islands, southern Vancouver Island and the southern edge of the Lower Mainland in British Columbia.

The W̱SÁNEĆ (weh-saanich) peoples are represented by the Tsartlip (Sart-Lip), Pauquachin (Paw-Qua-Chin), Tsawout (Say-Out), Tseycum (Sigh-Come) and Malahat (Mal-a-hat) Nations. The W̱SÁNEĆ Leadership Council Society consists of three of theses Nations: Tsartlip, Tseycum and Tsawout. These W̱SÁNEĆ First Nations remain on their ancestral lands.

==Saanich bands==
* – Malahat First Nation
* – Pauquachin
* – Tsawout
* – Tsartlip
* – Tseycum First Nation

== Leadership Council ==
On May 7, 2018, the W̱SÁNEĆ Leadership Council was created as a representation of the W̱SÁNEĆ First Nations to the Government. The creation of this council not only brought three Indigenous groups together, but it also established a legal governing body. With this council, came many proposals and projects to benefit the W̱SÁNEĆ First Nations.

Includes:
*January 2018, the submission of a proposal for the Government of Canada to make the council a legal governing body (accepted).
*Submission of funding to the federal government&#x27;s &quot;National Rebuilding&quot; program.
*Negotiations of a government to government project with the Capital Regional District.

== Language ==
The W̱SÁNEĆ language or Saanich dialect is called SENĆOŦEN. This dialect was revitalized by the late John Elliot, an important member of the W̱SÁNEĆ community and peoples.

== Tribal school==

Four of the Saanich First Nations, Tsartlip, Pauquachin, Tseycum and Tsawout, created the Tribal School in 1989. It holds classes from preschool to grade 10, with classes for adults in the adult centre next door to the high school where , the language, and culture are taught along with the provincial curriculum. The school is also a venue for community events.

<doc id="791997" wikidata="Q664271" url="?curid=791997" title="Constitution of the Year III">
<text>The Constitution of the Year III () was the constitution of the French First Republic that established the Executive Directory. Adopted by the convention on 5 Fructidor Year III (22 August 1795) and approved by plebiscite on 6 September. Its preamble is the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and of the Citizen of 1789.

It remained in effect until the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) effectively ended the Revolutionary period and began the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was more conservative than the not implemented, radically democratic French Constitution of 1793.

Largely the work of political theorist Pierre Daunou, it established a bicameral legislature; an upper body known as the Council of Ancients, and a lower house, or Council of 500. This was intended to slow down the legislative process, in reaction to the wild swings of policy resulting from the unicameral National Assembly, Legislative Assembly, and National Convention.

All taxpaying French males over 25 were eligible to vote in primary elections, subject to a one year residence provision; it is estimated these totalled around 5 million, more than the 4 million under the 1791 Constitution. They selected 30,000 electors, over the age of 30 and income equivalent to 150 days taxes, who in turn voted for the Council of 500.

A five-man Directory, chosen by lot each year, constituted the executive branch. The central government retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press and freedom of association. The Declaration of Rights and Duties of Mankind at the beginning of the constitution included an explicit ban on slavery. It was succeeded by the Constitution of the Year VIII, which established the Consulate.

== Background ==

After the fall of Robespierre and the overthrowing of the Revolutionary Government on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), the Thermidorian Convention refused to apply the Constitution of June 1793, also known as the Constitution of the First Year. The Thermidorians decided instead to draft the Constitution of Year III, intended to be more liberal, moderate, and favourable to the bourgeoisie than that of the First Year.

On 4 Floréal Year III (23 April 1795), the Convention delegates the task of drafting a new Constitution to a commission composed of 11 of its members, including Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, future Second Consul Cambacérès, Daunou, Merlin de Douai, and the Abbé Sieyès. A decree (&quot;décret&quot;) of 15 Floréal had declared the position of a member of the Constitutional Commission incompatible with being a member of the Committee of Public Safety. Following this decree, Cambacérès, Merlin, and Sieyès opted to remain members of the Committee, and were replaced by Baudin, Durand-Maillane, and Lanjuinais.

While discussing the project, Sieyès wished to implement a control of the constitutionality of laws, by creating a &quot;Constitutional Jury&quot; (French: Jury Constitutionnaire&quot;). Despite defending this idea in June 1795, it was not implemented, but would later become the basis of the Conservative Senate (&quot;Sénat conservateur&quot;) of the Consulate.

The day after the close of debates, the first day of Fructidor An III, deputy Baudin des Ardennes presented a report on &quot;the means of ending the Revolution&quot;, in which he recommended that two-thirds of the seats on the Conseil des Anciens and the Conseil des Cinq-Cents be reserved for members of the former Convention, amount to 500 of the 750 elected. To justify this &quot;decree of two-thirds&quot; (French: Décret des deux-tiers), he explained that &quot;the fall of the Constituent Assembly taught you well enough that (electing) an entirely new legislature to set in motion a constitution that has not yet been tried is an infallible means of having it overthrown&quot;.

The decree was passed, along with the constitution, on 5 fructidor an III (August 22, 1795). The decree and constitution were then each submitted to a plebiscite and approved on a low turnout, and adopted by the decree of 1st Vendémiaire, An IV (September 23, 1795), proclaiming the French people&#x27;s acceptance of the constitution presented to them by the National Convention.

The royalists responded to the two-thirds decree with the insurrection of 13 Vendémiaire (October 5, 1795). The Thermidorians thus retained the Republic, but re-established two-tier census suffrage out of distrust of universal suffrage.

== Territorial Modifications ==
The new territory of the French Republic is detailed in the first of the three Titles (&quot;Titres&quot;) of the Constitution of the Year III, &quot;Division of the Territory&quot; (French: Division du territoire).

The territory of the Republic is composed of 89 departments, composed of 81 of the 83 departments created in 1790, to which were added the following 8 departments:

* Golo and Liamone, resulting from the partition of Corsica;
* Loire and Rhône, resulting from the partition of Rhône-et-Loire;
* Alpes-Maritimes, resulting from the annexation of the county of Nice;
* Mont-Blanc, resulting from the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy
* Mont-Terrible, resulting from the annexation of the principality of Montbéliard and part of the bishopric of Basel;
* Vaucluse, resulting from the annexation of Avignon and Comtat Venaissin

Colonies are declared “integral parts of the Republic” and “subject to the same constitutional law”, and therefore given the statute of departments. Their departmentalisation is achieved by the creation of 11 to 13 departments:

* four to six departments in Santo Domingo;
* Guadeloupe and its dependencies (Marie-Galante, La Désirade, the Saintes and the French part of Saint-Martin);
* Martinique ;
* French Guiana and Cayenne;
* Saint-Lucia and Tobago;
* Île-de-France, Seychelles, Rodrigues and the establishments of Madagascar;
* Reunion Island;
* The East-Indies, Pondichery, Chandernagor, Mahé, Karical, and other establishments

== Citizenship ==

=== Acquiring of French Citizenship ===
The status of citizen (French: &quot;citoyen&quot;) is reserved for men aged 21 years and above. Every man over the age of 21, born and living in France, having registered his name at the civil register of his canton and having since remained within the territory of the Republic for at least a year, who pays a &quot;direct contribution, land or personal&quot;, is a French citizen.

Citizenship is given, without the condition of &quot;direct contribution&quot;, to those who have &quot;carried out one or multiple campaigns for the establishment of the Republic&quot;.

The conditions for the acquiring of citizenship by foreigners are described in the article 10 as follows:

* Having reached the age of twenty-one,
* Having declared his intention to settle in France, 
* Residing in France for seven consecutive years,

Provided that he pays direct taxes there and that, in addition, he either

* owns property in France,
* owns an agricultural or commercial establishment,
* or that he has married a French woman.

=== Loss of French Citizenship ===
In addition to the conditions of acquiring citizenship, the Constitution also provides the possibility of suspension or revoking of this citizenship.

<doc id="792017" wikidata="Q2916288" url="?curid=792017" title="Liberty dollar (private currency)">
<text>The American Liberty Dollar (ALD) was a private currency produced in the United States.

The currency was issued in minted metal rounds (similar to coins), gold and silver certificates, and electronic currency (eLD). ALD certificates are &quot;warehouse receipts&quot; for real gold and silver owned by the bearer. According to court documents, there were about 250,000 holders of Liberty Dollar certificates. The metal was warehoused at Sunshine Minting in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho prior to a November 2007 raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Until July 2009, the Liberty Dollar was distributed by Liberty Services (formerly known as &quot;National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code&quot; or NORFED), based in Evansville, Indiana. It was created by Bernard von NotHaus, the founder of the Cannabis Spiritual Center in Malibu, California, and the co-founder of the Royal Hawaiian Mint Company.

In May 2009, von NotHaus and others were charged with federal crimes in connection with the Liberty Dollar, and, on July 31, 2009, von NotHaus announced that he had closed the Liberty Dollar operation, pending resolution of the criminal charges. On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was pronounced guilty of &quot;making coins resembling and similar to United States coins&quot;. In late 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that Liberty Dollars seized in the 2007 FBI/USSS operation should be returned to their owners.

== Practices ==

=== Exchange service ===
From 1998 to July 2009, Liberty Services exchanged Federal Reserve Notes (U.S. dollars) for silver Liberty Dollars (and later gold and copper), as well as for Warehouse Receipts in both paper and digital forms.

=== Currency reform ===
Liberty Services&#x27; original name was &quot;National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Code&quot; (NORFED). Since its founding, the organization asserted that the Federal Reserve was unconstitutional and harmful. The company engaged in a series of legal battles both defending their exchange service and challenging exclusivity assertions made by the US Mint (see Legal issues).

=== Politics ===
Ron Paul Dollars were also briefly minted, taking advantage of Ron Paul&#x27;s public favoring of metals backed currency and the Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008. However, this raised issues of its legality amid an FBI raid confiscating two tons of the coins. This briefly caught the attentions of the media, taking note of its novelty over any actual value.

== Function ==

=== Differences from other alternative currencies ===
A number of alternative currencies exist in the United States, including Phoenix Dollars, Goldbacks, Baltimore&#x27;s BNote, Ithaca Hours, Bitcoin, and digital gold currency. Unlike some other alternative currencies, both Liberty Dollars and Phoenix Dollars were denominated by weight and backed by a commodity: Liberty Dollars used gold, silver, platinum, or copper. Other private currencies use different bases, such as tying their value to a specific unit of time; i.e., 1 hour = 1 Time Dollar. Under the most simplistic version of that model, the future value of the currency would depend on the willingness of people to swap their labor, regardless of the market value of the labor provided. However, systems such as Ithaca Hours have introduced more sophisticated models that allow for variations in market value of labor. Liberty Dollars also differed from other alternative currencies in that they carried a suggested US dollar face value.

The only laws that pertain to private currencies are ordinary statutes against fraud. Coining is more technologically difficult than is printing, and inclusion of precious metal in coins has long been seen as a means of &quot;embedding&quot; value into them. The Liberty Dollar consisted of coins and printed notes. Paper and digital Liberty Dollars were legally defined as warehouse receipts and were backed by a physical commodity: a weight in precious metal. 18 USC 486, however, makes it a crime to make, utter, or pass any coin or bar of gold, silver, or any other metal if it is intended to be used as money, so there is a definitive injunction against the minting of coins for that purpose.

=== Liberty Dollar base values, discounts, and commissions ===
The Liberty Dollar &quot;base value&quot; was created by Bernard von NotHaus. , the base value of the Liberty Dollar was Liberty Dollars to one ounce of silver. At the time the Liberty Dollar operation was closed, one ounce Liberty Dollar gold pieces were denominated ,000 with a maximum charge of 10% over spot price with membership. The previous base values were silver ounce, silver ounce and gold ounce. Non-members paid full face value for all currency except for certain Special and Numismatic items. Members&#x27; discounts ranged from 0% to 50%+ (actually, for short periods during crossovers it was possible that even members could not buy Liberty Dollars at face value or less).

Liberty Dollar associates and merchants used to exchange for Liberty Dollars at a discount, so they could &quot;make money when [they] spend money.&quot; To further distinguish how the Liberty Dollar worked, von NotHaus transitioned to a commission structure in June 2007 where associates and merchants received a commission in the form of extra Liberty Dollars when they placed their orders. Regional currency officers received larger discounts; they were the regional distributors and official representatives of Liberty Services.

The Liberty Dollar associate and merchant discounts ranged from 0.0%–50%+ (zero to more than fifty percent) depending on where the price of silver was, relative to the Liberty Dollar base value, the Liberty Dollar base value crossover points, and the time periods during which the price stayed above varying moving-day averages over 30, 60 or 90 days in a fluctuating market, based on Liberty Dollar formulas worked out by von NotHaus.

=== Regional currency office ===
A &quot;regional currency office&quot; was a kind of distributor of Liberty Dollars. In exchange for a fee paid to the Liberty Dollar Organization, they could purchase Liberty dollars for resale at a discount. They were also authorized to purchase, convert, or perhaps exchange Liberty Dollars for Federal Reserve Notes.

== Legal issues ==

=== Federal Government response ===
Numerous individuals within the U.S. Government have been interviewed regarding the Liberty Dollar. The Liberty Dollar organization asserted one Secret Service agent claimed &quot;It&#x27;s not counterfeit money&quot; while remaining &quot;skeptical&quot; of NORFED. Another agent reportedly warned that the Liberty Dollar &quot;appears to be in violation of .&quot; The minting of Liberty Dollar coins also appears to be in violation of :

The promoter of the Liberty Dollar asserts that Claudia Dickens, spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, had previously said American Liberty Currency is legitimate. Dickens was quoted as having said &quot;There&#x27;s nothing illegal about this&quot;, after the Treasury Department&#x27;s legal team reviewed the currency. &quot;As long as it doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;legal tender&#x27; there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.&quot;

In 2006 the U.S. Mint issued a press release stating that prosecutors at the Justice Department had determined that using Liberty Dollars as circulating money is a federal crime. The press release also stated that the &quot;Liberty Dollars&quot; are meant to compete with the circulating coinage (currency) of the United States and such competition consequently is a criminal act. The Justice Department also stated that the Liberty Dollar was confusingly similar to actual U.S. currency, and the language used on NORFED&#x27;s website was deceptive.

The Liberty Dollar organization responded to the Mint&#x27;s press release by stating that &quot;[t]he Liberty Dollar never has claimed to be, does not claim to be, is not, and does not purport to be, &quot;legal tender&quot;.&quot; The promoters of the Liberty Dollar have asserted that the Liberty Dollar is not legal tender, and that legal tender and barter are mutually exclusive concepts. The promoter asserts that the Liberty Dollar is a numismatic piece or medallion which may be used voluntarily as barter.

=== &quot;Bernard von NotHaus v. the U.S. Mint&quot; ===
On March 20, 2007, Liberty Services owner Bernard von NotHaus filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the U.S. Mint&#x27;s claims regarding the Liberty Dollar. Defendants include Henry M. Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury; Alberto R. Gonzales, former Attorney General of the United States; and Edmund C. Moy, Director of the Mint. The suit sought a declaratory judgment that circulating Liberty Dollars as a voluntary barter currency is not a federal crime and an injunction barring the Defendants from publicly or privately declaring the Liberty Dollar an illegal currency and to remove any such declarations from the U.S. Mint&#x27;s website.

=== FBI / Secret Service raid ===
The Liberty Dollar offices were raided by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) on November 14, 2007. Bernard von NotHaus, the owner of Liberty Services, sent an email to customers and supporters saying that the agents took all the gold, silver, and platinum, and almost two tons of Ron Paul Dollars. The agents also seized computers and files and froze the Liberty Dollar bank accounts. Von NotHaus&#x27;s email linked to a signup page for a class action lawsuit so that the victims might recover their assets. At the same time, all forms on his website relating to purchases of Liberty Dollars became nonfunctional.

Copies of the email and the warrant documents have been posted to the website. The seizure warrant was issued for money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, counterfeiting, and conspiracy.

The local &quot;Evansville Courier &amp; Press&quot; reported the email, stating that &quot;FBI Agent Wendy Osborne, a spokeswoman for the FBI&#x27;s Indianapolis office, directed all questions on the raid to the Western District of North Carolina U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office. A spokeswoman there said she had no information on the investigation. Bernard von NotHaus, the group&#x27;s monetary architect and the author of the email, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.&quot;

The Associated Press quoted von NotHaus on November 16, 2007, as saying that the federal government was &quot;running scared right now and they had to do something ... I&#x27;m volunteering to meet the agents and get arrested so we can thrash this out in court.&quot;

===Indictment===
A federal grand jury brought an indictment against von NotHaus and three others in May 2009 in United States District Court in Statesville, North Carolina, and von NotHaus was arrested on June 6, 2009. Bernard von NotHaus was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess and sell coins in resemblance and similitude of coins of a denomination higher than five cents, and silver coins in resemblance of genuine coins of the United States in denominations of five dollars and greater, in violation of , , and ; one count of mail fraud in violation of and ; one count of selling, and possessing with intent to defraud, coins of resemblance and similitude of United States coins in denominations of five cents and higher, in violation of and ; and one count of uttering, passing, and attempting to utter and pass, silver coins in resemblance of genuine U.S. coins in denominations of five dollars or greater, in violation of and .

On July 28, 2009, von NotHaus entered a plea of not guilty.

===Conviction===
On March 18, 2011, von NotHaus was convicted of &quot;making, possessing and selling his own coins&quot;, after a jury in Statesville, North Carolina deliberated for less than two hours. The jury found him guilty of one count under and , one count of violating and , and one count of conspiracy, under , to violate sections 485 and 486. He faces up to 15 years in prison, a ,000 fine, and may be forced to give million worth of minted coins and precious metals to the government, weighing 16,000 pounds. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne M. Tompkins, described the Liberty Dollar as &quot;a unique form of domestic terrorism&quot; that is trying &quot;to undermine the legitimate currency of this country&quot;. The Justice Department press release quotes her as saying: &quot;While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.&quot;

According to the Associated Press, &quot;Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word &quot;dollar&quot; and the motto &quot;Trust in God,&quot; similar to the &quot;In God We Trust&quot; that appears on U.S. coins&quot;.

==Post-conviction==
Since his trial, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has said that his followers describe von NotHaus as &quot;the Rosa Parks of the constitutional currency movement.&quot;

He appealed his conviction, but his appeal was denied on November 10, 2014.

On November 11, 2014, Judge Voorhees denied von NotHaus&#x27;s Motion for Acquittal. On December 2, 2014, despite prosecutor demands that he serve as much as 23 years in Federal prison, he was sentenced to 6 months house arrest, with 3 years probation. As part of his reasoning for delivering a greatly reduced sentence from what Federal Prosecutors demanded, Judge Richard L. Voorhees considered von NotHaus&#x27;s appeal, which stated:

:...if anything is clear from the evidence presented at trial, it is that the last thing Mr. von NotHaus wanted was for Liberty Dollars [to] be confused with coins issued by the United States government...His intention – to protest the Federal Reserve system – has always been plain. The jury&#x27;s verdict conflates a program created to function as an alternative to the Federal Reserve system with one designed to [deceive] people into believing it was the very thing Mr. von NotHaus was protesting in the first place...the Liberty Dollars was not a counterfeit and was not intended to function as such. The verdict is a perversion of the counterfeiting statutes and should be set aside.

The conviction, which was seen as a victory for the government, has now defined as prohibiting the use of silver bullion, or any other metal coin or bar not issued under government authority, from being used as currency in commerce. The Silver Certificates issued by Liberty Services were not considered any form of counterfeiting or violation of law.

Bernard von NotHaus&#x27;s probation officer suggested he file for early release from probation after one year, and recommended the early termination to the court. Termination of probation was formally granted December 9, 2015 by U.S. District Judge Richard L. Voorhees.

When asked about the government&#x27;s motive for accusing him of terrorism, von NotHaus scoffed, &quot;This is the United States government. It&#x27;s got all the guns, all the surveillance, all the tanks, it has nuclear weapons, and it&#x27;s worried about some ex-surfer guy making his own money? Give me a break!&quot;

===Forfeiture trial===
The forfeiture trial was scheduled to resume Monday, April 4, 2011. Federal prosecutors were seeking to take roughly million worth or five tons in Liberty Dollars minted in gold and silver seized in 2007 from a warehouse by the FBI and USSS.

===Liberty Dollars are returned===
In 2017, a significant number of seized Liberty Dollars were returned to their owners after petitions were made to the court for this return. Bernard von NotHaus continues to honor redemption of silver to this day.

<doc id="792022" wikidata="Q1274556" url="?curid=792022" title="United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force">
<text>The United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force (UN ICT TF) was a multi-stakeholder initiative associated with the United Nations which is &quot;intended to lend a truly global dimension to the multitude of efforts to bridge the global digital divide, foster digital opportunity and thus firmly put ICT at the service of development for all&quot;.

==Establishment==
The UN ICT Task Force was created by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in November 2001, acting upon a request by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) dated July 11, 2000, with an initial term of mandate of three years (until the end of 2004). It followed in the footsteps of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Digital Divide Initiative (GDDI), and the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), established in 2000 by the G8 at their annual summit in Okinawa, Japan. By providing it with a home in the United Nations, this accorded the UN ICT Task Force, in the eyes of many developing countries, a broader legitimization than the previous WEF and G8 initiatives, even if these previous initiatives also included a multi-stakeholder approach with broad participation by stakeholders from industrialized and developing countries.

==Aims and objectives==
The Task Force&#x27;s principal aim was to provide policy advice to governments and international organizations for bridging the digital divide. In addition to supporting the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and leading the UN in developing ICT strategies for development, the Task Force&#x27;s objective was to form partnerships between the UN system and states, private industry, trusts, foundations, and donors, and other stakeholders.

==Membership and organization==
The UN ICT Task Force has included the top ranks of the computer industry (Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Nokia, SAP, Siemens, Sun Microsystems), together with global NGOs (e.g., the Association for Progressive Communications), governments and international agencies. Its coordinating body was a multi-stakeholder bureau, assisted by a small secretariat at UN headquarters in New York. Technical advice was provided by a high-level panel of technical advisors.

==Activities==

===United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS)===

Within the Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology (22 May 2000) suggesting a UN ICT Task Force, the panel welcomed the establishment of a United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS), suggested by Kofi Annan in &quot;We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the 21st century&quot; (Millennium Report of the Secretary-General). The panel made suggestions on its configuration and implementation strategy, including that ICT4D volunteering opportunities make mobilizing &quot;national human resources&quot; (local ICT experts) within developing countries a priority, for both men and women. The initiative was launched at the United Nations Volunteers under the leadership of Sharon Capeling-Alakija and was active from February 2001 to February 2005. Initiative staff and volunteers participated in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in December 2003.

===Challenge to Silicon Valley===
In November 2002 Kofi Annan issued a Challenge to Silicon Valley to create suitable systems at prices low enough to permit deployment everywhere. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ran a refugee camp in Tanzania where the Global Catalyst Foundation had placed computers and communications equipment for the use of the Burundian refugees confined there. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) worked with the Kingdom of Bhutan on a Simputer project.

===World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)===
The Task Force was active, inter alia, in the process leading to the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in December 2003 and WSIS II in Tunis, Tunisia, in November 2005. In order to participate in the second phase of the WSIS, the Task Force&#x27;s original three-year mandate was extended by another year and expired on 31 December 2005, with no further extension.

===Working groups===
The Task Force&#x27;s stakeholders, members and the experts on the panel of technical advisors, were active in working groups organized around four broad themes:

* ICT policy and governance
* Enabling environment
* Human resource development and capacity building
* ICT Indicators and MDG mapping

===Regional networks===
Regional activities were carried out in five regional networks—Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, Arab States, and Europe and Central Asia.

===Meetings===
2002, June 17–18: A session of the General Assembly of the United Nations was devoted to information and communication technologies for development, addressing the digital divide in the context of globalization and the development process. The session promoted coherence and synergies between various regional and international information and communication technologies initiatives. The meeting also contributed to the preparation of WSIS. Many countries were represented by high-level officials responsible for communications and for development.

The Task Force held 10 semi-annual meetings in various places that served as important venues for exchange of best practices, and to bring the various stakeholders together to work on common themes. Most successful, in the eyes of the participants, were those meetings that were held in conjunction with a series of Global Forums:
* 1st meeting: at UN headquarters in New York City, NY, (United States) - November 19–20, 2001.
* 2nd meeting: at UN headquarters in New York City, NY, (United States) - February 3–4, 2002.
* 3rd meeting: at UN headquarters in New York City, NY, (United States) - September 30 - October 1, 2002, focused on ICT for development in Africa. It also reviewed the results of the first year of Task Force activities and agreed on an ambitious strategy for the next two years.
* 4th meeting: at UN in Geneva, (Switzerland) - February 21–22, 2004, with a Private Sector Forum.
* 5th meeting: at WIPO in Geneva - September 12–13, 2003, to allow participants to discuss the Task Force&#x27;s contribution to WSIS.
* 6th meeting: at UN headquarters in New York City, NY, (United States) - March 2004, with a Global Forum on Internet Governance.
* 7th meeting: at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin, Germany - November 18–20, 2004, with a Global Forum on an Enabling Environment.
* 8th meeting: in Dublin, Ireland - April 13–15, 2005, with a Global Forum on Harnessing the Potential of ICTs in Education.
* 9th meeting: at ILO in Geneva, Switzerland - October 1, 2005.
* 10th (final) meeting: at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia - November 17, 2005.

In addition, a Global Roundtable Forum on &quot;Innovation and Investment: Scaling Science and Technology to Meet the MDGs&quot; was held in New York City, 13 September 2005. The primary focus of the Forum was on the critical role of science, technology and innovation, especially information and communication technologies, in scaling-up grassroots, national and global responses to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

==WSIS II in Tunis==
Parallel to the booth at the ICT4ALL exhibition, a series of events was held under the auspices of the UN ICT Task Force and its members:

===Measuring the Information Society===
The Partnership for Measuring ICT for Development involves 11 organizations—Eurostat, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations ICT Task Force, the five United Nations Regional Commissions and the World Bank.

===Role of Parliaments in the Information Society===
Key parliament leaders presented their views on the role that national and regional assemblies can play in building the information society at a “High-level Dialogue on Governance, Global Citizenship and Technology”, on 16 November.

===Choosing the Right Technologies for Education===
At this workshop, the Global e-School Initiative presented the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator—a framework for identifying and selecting the right ICT for schools by assessing their benefits, feasibility and costs.

===Building Partnerships for the Information Society===
Two high-level round tables on 16 November focused on “Regional Perspectives for the Global Information Society” and on “Women in the Information Society: Building a Gender Balanced Knowledge-based Economy”.

===Putting ICT to Work for the Millennium Development Goals and the UN Development Agenda===
The 17 November round table examined how ICT can be applied to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, and discussed ways to raise awareness of ICT as an enabler of development.

===Achieving Better Quality and Cost Efficiency in Health Care and Education through ICT===
The 17 November panel demonstrated the potential of ICT to improve quality and cost efficiency of key public services, with specific focus on education and health care.

===Bridging the Digital Divide with Broadband Wireless Internet===
The 17 November round table focused on the critical role that broadband wireless infrastructure deployments play in bridging the digital divide.

==Outcomes from WSIS==

===GESCI===
One of the notable outcomes of the work of the UN ICT Task Force was the creation in 2003 of the Global E-Schools and Communities Initiative (GESCI), an international NGO initially located in Dublin, Ireland, to improve education in schools and communities through the use of information and communication technologies. GESCI was officially launched during the WSIS.

Today GESCI (www.gesci.org) is located in Nairobi, Kenya. It has evolved into an organization engaging with governments and ministries, development partners, the private sector and communities to provide strategic advice, coordinate policy dialogue, conduct research and develop and implement models of good practice for the widespread use and integration of ICTs in formal education and other learning environments, within the context of supporting the development of inclusive knowledge societies and the achievement of the SDGs.

===ePol-Net===
Another outcome is the Global ePolicy Resource Network (ePol-NET), designed to marshal global efforts in support of national e-strategies for development. The network provides ICT policymakers in developing countries with the depth and quality of information needed to develop effective national e-policies and e-strategies. The network was first proposed by the members of the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), who merged their activities with the UN ICT Task Force in 2002. The ePol-Net was also officially launched during the WSIS.

===Global Centre for ICT in Parliament===
Another outcome of the WSIS is the Global Centre for ICT in Parliament. Launched by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) in cooperation with the Inter-parliamentary Union (IPU) on the occasion of the World Summit of the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis in November 2005, the Global Centre for Information and Communication Technologies in Parliament responds to the common desire to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society, where legislatures are empowered to better fulfill their constitutional functions through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament acts as a clearing house for information, research, innovation, technology and technical assistance, and promotes a structured dialogue among parliaments, centres of excellence, international organizations, the civil society, the private sector and the donor community, with the purpose to enhance the sharing of experiences, the identification of best practices and the implementation of appropriate solutions.

==Follow-up==
The task of bridging the digital divide is yet unfinished. The WSIS has called for an Internet Governance Forum to allow for a global multi-stakeholder discussion of issues related to the governance of the global resource that the Internet represents. The WSIS also called for a follow-up and implementation process, for which the principles embodied in the multi-stakeholder composition and workings of the UN ICT TF can provide a useful model.

Work is also being carried on by the UN Group on the Information Society (UN GIS), with a focus on the UN System, and the successor to the UN ICT TF, the Global Alliance for ICT and Development (GAID), with an international development emphasis.

<text>The City of North Vancouver is a city municipality on the North Shore of the Burrard Inlet, in British Columbia, Canada. Anchored by the downtown town centre of Lonsdale, with which its urban core is largely synonymous, it consists of the smallest and most urbanized of the communities situated north of the city of Vancouver, and is part of the Metro Vancouver regional district, though it has significant industry of its ownincluding shipping, chemical production, and film production. The city is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Ambulance Service, and the North Vancouver City Fire Department.

==History==
In the 1880s, Arthur Heywood-Lonsdale and a relation James Pemberton Fell, made substantial investments through their company, Lonsdale Estates, and in 1882 he financed the Moodyville investments. Several locations in the North Vancouver area are named after Lonsdale and his family.

Not long after the District of North Vancouver was formed, an early land developer and second reeve of the new council, James Cooper Keith, personally underwrote a loan to commence construction of a road which undulated from West Vancouver to Deep Cove amid the slashed sidehills, swamps, and burnt stumps. The road, sometimes under different names and not always contiguous, is still one of the most important east-west thoroughfare carrying traffic across the North Shore.

Development was slow at the outset. The population of the district in the 1901 census was only 365 people. Keith joined Edwin Mahon and together they controlled North Vancouver Land &amp; Improvement Company. Soon the pace of development around the foot of Lonsdale began to pick up. The first school was opened in 1902. The district was able to build a municipal hall in 1903 and actually have meetings in North Vancouver (instead of in Vancouver where most of the landowners lived). The first bank and first newspaper arrived in 1905. In 1906 the BC Electric Railway Company opened up a street car line that extended from the ferry wharf up Lonsdale to 12th Street. By 1911 the streetcar system extended west to the Capilano River and east to Lynn Valley.

The owners of businesses who operated on Lonsdale, as part of an initiative led by Keith and Mahon, brought a petition to the district council in 1905, calling for a new, compact city to be carved out of the unwieldy district.

During the ensuing two years there was much and sometimes heated debate. Some thought the new city should have a new name such as Northport, Hillmont or Parkhill. Burrard became the favourite of the new names but majority view was that North Vancouver remain in order to remain associated with the rising credibility of Vancouver in financial markets and as a place to attract immigrants.

Some thought the boundary of the new city should reflect geography and extend from Lynn Creek or Seymour River west to the Capilano River and extend three miles up the mountainside. That the boundary of the city which came into existence in 1907 just happened to match that of the lands owned by the North Vancouver Land &amp; Improvement Company and Lonsdale Estate was no accident. Since the motivation for creating the city was to reserve local tax revenue for the work of putting in services for the property owned by the major developers, there was little reason to take on any of the burden beyond the extent of their holdings.

Residents in west part of the District of North Vancouver now had less reason to be connected with what remained and they petitioned to create the District of West Vancouver (the west part of the North Shore, not the west side of Vancouver) in 1912. The eastern boundary of that new municipality is for the most part the Capilano River and a community that is easily distinguished from the two North Vancouvers has since developed.

The City of North Vancouver continued to grow around the foot of Lonsdale Avenue. Serviced by the North Vancouver Ferries, it proved a popular area. Commuters used the ferries to work in Vancouver. Street cars and early land speculation, spurred interest in the area. Streets, city blocks and houses were slowly built around lower Lonsdale. Wallace Shipyards, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway provided an industrial base, although, the late arrival of the Second Narrows railway bridge in 1925 controlled development.
 The Depression again bankrupted the city, while the Second World War turned North Vancouver into the Clydeside of Canada with a large shipbuilding program. Housing the shipyard workers provided a new building boom, which continued on through the post-war years. By that time, North Vancouver became a popular housing area.

==Geography==

The City of North Vancouver is separated from Vancouver by the Burrard Inlet, and it is surrounded on three sides by the District of North Vancouver. The city has much in common with the district and with West Vancouver; together, the three are commonly referred to as the North Shore.

The City of North Vancouver is relatively densely populated with a number of residential high-rise buildings in the Central Lonsdale and Lower Lonsdale areas.

The North Shore mountains have many drainages: Capilano River, MacKay, Mosquito, and Lynn Creeks, and Seymour River.

===Climate===
North Vancouver has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool, rainy winters and dry, warm summers.

*Lonsdale Quay Market, easily accessible from the Seabus. The Quay has a view of Vancouver&#x27;s skyline and is locally owned and operated.

==Transportation==

The City of North Vancouver is connected to Vancouver by two highway bridges (the Lions Gate Bridge and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) and by a passenger ferry, the SeaBus. That system and the bus system in North Vancouver is operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company, an operating company of TransLink. The hub of the bus system is Lonsdale Quay, the location of the SeaBus terminal. Currently, there is no rail transit service on the North Shore.

The main street in the city is Lonsdale Avenue, which begins at Lonsdale Quay and goes north to 29th Street, where it continues in the District of North Vancouver, ending at Rockland Road.

Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway (often referred to as the &quot;Upper Levels Highway&quot;) passes through the northern portion of the city. It is a freeway for its entire length within the City of North Vancouver. There are six interchanges on Highway 1 within the City of North Vancouver:

*Main Street/Dollarton Highway (Exit 23)
*Mountain Highway and Mt Seymour Parkway (Exit 21/22)
*Lynn Valley Road (Exit 19)
*Lonsdale Avenue (Exit 18)
*Westview Drive (Exit 17)
*Capilano Road (Exit 14)

==Education==

Public schools are managed by the North Vancouver School District, which operates 8 high schools and 30 elementary schools shared by the city and the District of North Vancouver.

The &quot;Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique&quot; operates one Francophone school in that city: &quot;école André-Piolat&quot;, which has both primary and secondary levels.

There are also several independent private elementary and high schools in the area, including Bodwell High School and Lions Gate Christian Academy.

Post-secondary education is available at Capilano University in the district, as well as at Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia in neighbouring communities.

<text>The grapevine is a dance figure in partner dancing that shares a common appearance, with some variation, in ballroom, club, and folk dances. It includes side steps and steps across the support foot. The step is used, for example, in the foxtrot, polka, Electric Slide and hustle as well as in freestyle aerobics. 

Troy and Margaret West Kinney described it in 1914 as part of the One-Step.
==Sequence==
The most basic repeating sequence of steps may be;

* Side step, 
* Step behind the support foot, 
* Side step, 
* Step across support foot.

The sequence may start from any of the four steps and may break wherever it is convenient to move into another dance figure or in the opposite direction. The whole sequence is in the same direction. 

In some dances (e.g., Polka, Hustle, Electric Slide) it is an eight count figure, often split into two, mirroring each other and called &quot;grapevine to the right&quot; and &quot;grapevine to the left&quot;.

# Step right
# Step left foot to the right, crossing in front of right foot
# Step right
# Tap left against right
# Step left
# Step right foot to the left, crossing in front of the left foot
# Step left
# Tap right against left

<text>Lake Sevan () is the largest body of water in both Armenia and the Caucasus region. It is one of the largest freshwater high-altitude (alpine) lakes in Eurasia. The lake is situated in Gegharkunik Province, at an altitude of above sea level. The total surface area of its basin is about , which makes up of Armenia&#x27;s territory. The lake itself is , and the volume is . It is fed by 28 rivers and streams. Only 10% of the incoming water is drained by the Hrazdan River, while the remaining 90% evaporates.

Sevan has significant economic, cultural, and recreational value. Its sole major island (now a peninsula) is home to a medieval monastery. The lake provides some 90% of the fish and 80% of the crayfish catch of Armenia. 

Sevan was heavily exploited for irrigation of the Ararat plain and hydroelectric power generation during the Soviet period. Consequently, its water level decreased by around and its volume reduced by more than 40%. Later, two tunnels were built to divert water from highland rivers, which halted its decline and its level began rising. Before human intervention dramatically changed the lake&#x27;s ecosystem, the lake was at an altitude of above sea level, deep, covered an area of (5% of Armenia&#x27;s entire area), and had a volume of .

== Etymology ==

In the Middle Ages, Sevan was solely the name of the island (now peninsula) and the monastery built on it. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Russian and European sources sometimes referred to the lake as &quot;Sevanga&quot; or &quot;Sevang&quot;, Per folk etymology, &quot;Sevan&quot; is either a combination of &quot;sev&quot; (&quot;black&quot;) and &quot;vank’&quot; (&quot;monastery&quot;), &quot;sev&quot; (&quot;black&quot;) + Van (i.e., Lake Van), or originates from the phrase &quot;sa ē vank&#x27;ə&quot; (&quot;this is the monastery&quot;). 

The scholarly explanation, first suggested by in 1896, is that &quot;Sevan&quot; originated from the Urartian word &quot;suinia&quot;, usually translated as &quot;lake&quot;. It is attested on an 8th-century BC cuneiform inscription by the Urartian king Rusa I, found in Odzaberd, on the southern shore of the lake.

The historical Armenian name of the lake, attested in early medieval texts, is &quot;Sea of Gegham&quot; (classical Armenian: ծով Գեղամայ, &quot;tsov Geghamay&quot;). The historic Georgian name of the lake is &quot;Gelakuni&quot; (გელაქუნი), which is essentially the Georgian transcription of Armenian &quot;Gegharkuni&quot;. In classical antiquity, the lake was known as &quot;Lychnitis&quot; (). John Chardin, who visited the lake in 1673, called it the &quot;Lake of Erivan&quot; and wrote that it was called &quot;Deria-Shirin&quot; (&quot;sweet lake&quot;) by Persians and &quot;Kiagar-couni-sou&quot; by Armenians.

The Turkic name &quot;Gokcha&quot; or &quot;Gökche&quot;, which means &quot;blue lake&quot; was also used in Russian and British sources from the 17th to early 20th centuries.

== Significance ==
=== Cultural ===
Along with Lake Van and Lake Urmia, Sevan is considered one of the three great &quot;seas&quot; of historic Armenia. It is the only one within the boundaries of present-day Republic of Armenia, while the other two are located in Turkey and Iran, respectively. Lake Sevan is considered the &quot;jewel&quot; of Armenia and is &quot;recognized as a national treasure&quot; in the country. The 2001 Law on Lake Sevan defines the lake as &quot;a strategic ecosystem valuable for its environmental, economical, social, scientific, cultural, aesthetic, medical, climatic, recreational, and spiritual value.&quot;

Chardin in 1673 noted the &quot;extraordinary sweetness of the water&quot;, the &quot;small Island in the middle of it; where stands a Monastery built about 600 years ago, of which the Prior is an Archbishop&quot;, and &quot;nine sorts of fish which are there taken; the fairest trouts and carps which are eaten at Erivan being caught in this Lake&quot;.

Naturalist and traveler Friedrich Parrot, best known for ascending Mount Ararat in 1829 for the first time in history, wrote:
=== Economic ===
It is important for the Armenian economy: being the main source of irrigation water, Sevan provides low-cost electricity, fish, recreation, and tourism.

== Origin ==
Sevan originated during the early Quaternary when tectonic formation created a Palaeo-Sevan, ten times larger than the present lake. The current lake was formed some 25 to 30 thousand years ago.

== Human intervention ==

=== Exploitation and reduction ===

==== Background ====
Sevan was recognized as being a major potential water resource in the 19th century. Its high altitude location relative to the fertile Ararat plain and limited energy resources attracted engineers to explore ways of usage of the lake&#x27;s water. In his 1910 book, Armenian engineer Sukias Manasserian proposed using Sevan&#x27;s water for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. He proposed draining the lake by . Major Sevan would completely dry out, while Minor Sevan would have a surface area of .

==== Implementation ====
Manasserian&#x27;s proposal was adopted by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s when, under Joseph Stalin, the country was undergoing rapid industrialization. Works on the project started in 1933. The riverbed of Hrazdan was deepened through excavation. A tunnel was bored around under the lake&#x27;s surface. The tunnel was completed in 1949 and thereafter the Sevan&#x27;s level began to drop significantly, at a rate over per year. The water was used for irrigation and the Sevan–Hrazdan Cascade of six hydroelectric power stations on Hrazdan River.

==== Effects ====
During the second half of the 20th century, the ecological condition of Lake Sevan underwent tangible changes and vast degradation due to reduced water level, increased eutrophication, and detrimental impact of human activity on the biological diversity of the lake. According to Babayan et al. the lake level dropped by by 2002, while the volume decreased by 43.8% (from ). Due to the water level decrease, the quality of the water deteriorated, natural habitats were destroyed that meant loss of biodiversity. Vardanian wrote that drop of the lake level and the economic development in the basin brought about the change in hydro-chemical regime of the lake. The quality of the water deteriorated, water turbidity increased. The inner circulation of the water constituents as well as the circulation of the biological substances altered.

=== Reversal and recovery ===
According to Babayan et al. &quot;by the 1950s it had become evident that the ecological and economic consequences of extensive exploitation of the water of Lake Sevan were too undesirable to continue in the same way.&quot;

==== Arpa–Sevan tunnel ====
In 1964 a project began to divert the Arpa River (from a reservoir near Kechut) through a long tunnel to the lake near Artsvanist. The tunnel, called Arpa–Sevan, was completed in 1981. It brings up to of water to Sevan per year.

It is estimated, that due to climate change by year 2030, the outflow of the Arpa river will decrease by 22%.

==== Vorotan–Arpa tunnel ====
Since the water level in the lake did not rise as fast and as much, on 20 April 1981 the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union made a decision for the construction of the Vorotan–Arpa tunnel. This long tunnel was begun from the Spandarian Reservoir on the Vorotan River further south from Kechut. Due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the 1988 earthquake in northwestern Armenia construction was halted. The tunnel was inaugurated on 26 April 2004. The Vorotan–Arpa tunnel brings an additional to the lake annually.

==== Increase in water level ====
After the construction of the two tunnels the water level began rising significantly since the mid-2000s. In 2007 it was reported that the water level had risen by in the previous six years. It reached in October 2010. The government committee on Sevan forecasts that the level will reach by 2029.

Water level stood at 1900.44 m in November 2019.

== Population ==
The Gegharkunik Province, which roughly corresponds to the lake&#x27;s basin, had a &quot;de facto&quot; population of 211,828 according to the 2011 Armenian census. The largest settlements in the province are: Gavar (20,765), Sevan (19,229), Martuni (12,894), Vardenis (12,685), Vardenik (9,880), Yeranos (6,119), Chambarak (5,660), Lchashen (5,054), Tsovagyugh (4,189).

== Tourism ==
=== Beaches ===
Lake Sevan has the only beaches in Armenia. They are a popular destination for the Armenians. Sevan&#x27;s beaches provide a unique experience within the landlocked country for Armenians. The beaches adjacent to hotels are usually privatized. Numerous beaches are located along the entire lake shore. The most popular of them is a stretch on the northern shore, extending northwest from the peninsula. Resorts include Harsnaqar Hotel, Best Western Bohemian Resort, and numerous smaller facilities. Activities include swimming, sunbathing, jet skiing, windsurfing, and sailing. The area also includes numerous campgrounds and picnic areas for daytime use. A less-developed beach destination stretches along the eastern shore from Tsovagyugh to Shorzha, with numerous small cabins at Shorzha. The Avan Marak Tsapatagh Hotel, a Tufenkian Heritage Hotel, is a luxury resort on the undeveloped southeastern shore of the lake near Tsapatagh.

The Armenian government pledged to &quot;reduce the growing commercialization of rest at Lake Sevan that makes it unaffordable for most citizens struggling to find other beach options during hot Armenian summers.&quot; In 2011 the government established public beaches in the Sevan National Park&#x27;s recreational zone. The first two public beaches were opened in July. Some 100,000 people visited the public beaches in summer of 2011. The beaches have free parking space, children&#x27;s and sports playgrounds, toilets, medical aid stations, and rescue services. They are also equipped with beach couches. By 2014, the number of public beaches reached 11. Some 200,000 people took holiday there in 2014.


=== Sites of interest ===
The most famous cultural monument is the Sevanavank monastery located on the peninsula, which was until the mid-20th century an island. Another prominent monastery at the western shore is Hayravank, and further south, in the village of Noratus, is a field of &quot;khachkars&quot;; a cemetery with about 900 &quot;khachkars&quot; of different styles. Additional &quot;khachkars&quot; are found at Nerkin Getashen on the south coast.

In 2017, a Wikipedia globe was submerged in the lake to create an artificial reef.

== Fauna ==

=== Fish ===
Sevan trout (&quot;Salmo ischchan&quot;) is an endemic species of the lake, but it is endangered as some competitors were introduced into the lake, including common whitefish (&quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;) from Lake Ladoga, goldfish (&quot;Carrasius auratus&quot;), and crayfish (&quot;Astacus leptodactylus&quot;). If the Sevan trout is likely to become extinct in its &quot;home&quot; lake, it seems that it will survive in Issyk-Kul Lake (Kyrgyzstan), where it was introduced in the 1970s.

Due to anthropogenic impact, changes have occurred in all the biological components of the lake, including bacteria, benthos, and of course fish. Thus, the benthic mass increased tenfold in 1940, due to oligochaetes and chrinomices. Today, the former prevail and multiply the oxygen-rich residue at the bottom of the lake.

The &quot;bojak&quot; and winter &quot;bakhtak&quot; species of the Sevan-endemic trout have already disappeared. The summer &quot;bakhtak&quot; occurs rarely; the &quot;gegharkuni&quot; is still capable of reproducing naturally. In 1980s, the quantity of Sevan &quot;koghak&quot; significantly decreased. Numerous reasons for this have been identified:
* The level of the water was lowered, the paths of rivers changed, and the trout (&quot;gegharkuni&quot; and &quot;Aestivalis&quot; species) lost their natural spаwning places. Changes in the areas near the shore (mossing, disappearance of macrophyte plants) also had a negative impact on the trout lays. The trout spawn only in certain areas, with oxygen-rich underground water at the depth of .
* Deoxidization of the bottom is extremely detrimental for salmon, which are used to more than 4 mg/L of O2.
* In the last 10 years, poaching rapidly increased, which significantly reduced the number of fish in the lake.

=== Birds ===

The bird fauna of the lake and its vicinity makes over 200 species, out of which 95 species are breeding. The lake is an important breeding ground for the Armenian gull (&quot;Larus armenicus&quot;) with about 4,000–5,000 pairs. During migration the Lake is visited by wide variety of birds including raptors, such as Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;) and Steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;), waterbirds such as red-crested pochard (&quot;Netta rufina&quot;) and ferruginous duck (&quot;Aythya nyroca&quot;), while during the wintering period the lake hosts another set of species such as Bewick&#x27;s swan (&quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot;) and great black-headed gull (&quot;Larus ichthyaetus&quot;). Sometimes the lake is visited by very rare Armenian migrant lesser white-fronted goose (&quot;Anser erythropus&quot;).

== Culture ==
There are a lot of historical monuments located on the coast of Sevan, ranging from prehistoric petroglyphs to various monasteries. The monasteries include Sevanavank, Vanevan, Kotavank and others. There are also many historical castles and fortresses on the coast, including Berdkunk Fortress, Odzaberd, and others.

== Pollution ==
The rivers feeding Lake Sevan flow through densely populated settlements which produce agricultural, domestic, and industrial waste. It significantly changes the lake&#x27;s ecosystem. According to a 2017 study the lake&#x27;s water contains concentration of metals such as aluminium, nickel, arsenic, cobalt, and lead.

According to Armenian environmental organization EcoLur, the lake is in a critical condition because of the presence of vanadium. Environmental Impact Monitoring Center, an agency of the Armenian Ministry of Nature Protection, reported in 2012 that the average annual concentration of vanadium (64 μg/L) in the samples taken from Lake Sevan exceeded the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) by 6.4 times, while selenium (26 μg/L) exceeded MPC 2.6 times, copper (21 μg/L) 2.1 times, magnesium (60 μg/L) 1.2 times. A 2016 study found that mining and metallurgical industrial activities—namely the Sotk gold mine on the southeastern shore of the lake—caused significant heavy metal, especially vanadium, pollution of the Sotk and Masrik rivers in the Lake Sevan catchment basin. According to the researchers it &quot;may have posed health risks to aquatic life as well as to humans (at least in the case of river water used for drinking purposes).&quot;

<text>Julius Harold Bloedel (March 4, 1864 – September 21, 1957) was an American businessman and entrepreneur who operated primarily in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada.

==Biography==
Born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Bloedel moved from Wisconsin to Fairhaven, Washington (later Bellingham) in 1890, where he became president of Fairhaven National Bank. He engaged in several frontier business ventures, including the Samish Lake Lumber and Mill Company, Blue Canyon Coal Mines, and, as mentioned, the Fairhaven National Bank. He partnered and worked closely with the Bellingham pioneers. Although many of these operations folded eventually, Bloedel&#x27;s financial know-how managed to keep him afloat through a series of boom-and-bust economic trials. In August 1898, he founded the Whatcom Logging Company with fellow frontier businessmen John Joseph Donovan and Peter Larson, which would later become known as the Bloedel-Donovan Lumber Mills. A park with this name exists today in Bellingham, which sits on the site of Bloedel&#x27;s first lumber mill, which he dedicated as a park in 1946.

Using his existing operation in Bellingham as collateral, he began acquiring land in Canada, hoping to expand his lumber operation. In 1911, he and two new partners, John Stewart and Patrick Welch, came to Canada and began acquiring large blocks of forests on British Columbia&#x27;s Vancouver Island. The Bloedel, Stewart and Welch operation eventually overshadowed Bloedel&#x27;s previous ventures and their Franklin River logging camp soon became one of the world&#x27;s largest logging operations. Here, in the 1930s, the Canadian logging industry saw its first steel spar and chainsaw. Welch and Stewart were also contractors on the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, operating with another partner as Foley, Welch &amp; Stewart.

In the fall of 1911, the same year he started his Canadian logging operation, he moved to Seattle, where he lived with his wife, Mina Louise Prentice. He had three children: Prentice, Lawrence, and Charlotte. Julius Bloedel died in Seattle in 1957.

In the 1950s, now under the direction of his son Prentice, Bloedel&#x27;s company merged with the HR MacMillan Company to form one of the largest forest products companies in the world. MacMillan Bloedel Limited, often called just &quot;Mac-Blo&quot;, was eventually taken over by Weyerhaeuser in 1999. Bloedel Hall at the University of Washington in Seattle was named for Julius Bloedel. The Bloedel Conservatory of Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver was named for his son Prentice Bloedel for donating nearly $1.4 million for its construction in 1967. The Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island, Washington, was created by Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia.

His son Lawrence Bloedel was the librarian of Williams College. Upon his death, his collection of 300 artworks was bequeathed to the Whitney Museum of American Art and to the Williams College Museum of Art. After Lawrence&#x27;s death, his widow, Eleanore Bloedel, bequeathed Field Farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts to The Trustees of Reservations. His granddaughter, Virginia Wright, married businessman Bagley Wright and was a prominent art collector and philanthropist who played a key role in the arts scene of the Pacific Northwest.

<doc id="792228" wikidata="Q244319" url="?curid=792228" title="Pygmy cormorant">
<text>The pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmaeus) is a member of the Phalacrocoracidae (cormorant) family of seabirds. It breeds in south-eastern Europe and south-western Asia. It is partially migratory, with northern populations wintering further south, mostly within its breeding range. It is a rare migrant to western Europe.

== Distribution ==
The pygmy cormorant occupies an area from the south-east of Europe (east of Italy) and the south-west of temperate Asia, east to Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The largest distribution is in south-east Europe, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the Balkan countries, Turkey, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq (namely the Tigris–Euphrates river system), Azerbaijan, Israel, Syria.

In Romania, according to studies of Czech ornithologist Robert Ritter von Dombrowski, at the end of the 19th century, the pygmy cormorant was present in large colonies in the Danube Delta, Brăila and Ialomița Pond, on Vederoasa Lake (Constanța County), on certain pools and ponds with reeds and willows in Muntenia. The number of pygmy cormorant pairs was 10,000 without taking in account the breeding population of the Danube Delta. Populations of pygmy cormorant in Romania have dramatically declined, especially in 1960 when, due to the communist agricultural policies, the Great Brăila Island and important parts of Ialomiţa Pond were drained in order to practice agriculture, so the habitats of a great number of aquatic birds were destroyed. The pygmy cormorant can be found in the Danube Delta, Jijia Largă Pond (Iași County), probably on Mața, Rădeanu, Vădeni Ponds (in Galați County), Cârja Pond (Vaslui County), at Vlădești on Prut River (Galați County), on Calinovăț Island from Caraș-Severin County, on Small Brăila Island, on Dunăreni Pond (Mârleanu, Constanța County), in Danubian Plain on Parches Pond-Somova (Tulcea County).

At global scale, it was estimated that the entire population of pygmy cormorants is 85,000-180,000 individuals (a study effectuated by Wetlands International in 2006) and 74-94% of total population lives in Europe. The biggest colony is in the Danube Delta, numbering 4,000 pairs, but this seems certain to plunge due to a massive canalization scheme, which despite the protected status of the delta, commenced in May 2004. According to a study made by BirdLife International in 2004, it was estimated that population of pygmy cormorant in Romania was 11,500-14,000 pairs and during the winter 1,500-4,000 pairs.

== Habitat and ecology ==

Pygmy cormorants like pools with plenty of vegetation, lakes and river deltas. They avoid mountainous and cold and dry areas. They love rice fields or other flooded areas where trees and shrubs can be found. During winter they also go to waters with higher salinity, in estuaries or on barrier lakes. These are birds who can live alone or in groups and they have adapted to human presence. They build nests from sticks and reeds in dense vegetation, in trees, shrubs, willows but occasionally in reeds on small floating islets. At the end of May, beginning of June, both parents incubate for 27–30 days, and nestlings become independent after 70 days. The young are fed by their parents with small fish and other aquatic animals. This bird frequently shares the same type of habitat with egrets, herons and spoonbills.

== Threats ==
The pygmy cormorant is a species with habitats strongly affected by human actions. Threats include the drainage and serious degradation of wetlands and their associated woodland, water pollution, disturbance, and poaching as well as drowning in fishing nets.

Being a great fish consumer and destroyer of fishing nets, it is often persecuted by fishermen. In Romania, pond drainage located on the inferior course of the Danube for agricultural purposes, the accidental death of birds captive in improvised fishing nets, nest destruction by professional fishermen in order to protect fish resources decreased of the number of individuals which put the species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as a vulnerable species. It is also hunted in leisure activities, and in Iran the pygmy cormorant is commercialized for cooking.

This species is distinguished from the great cormorant and the common shag by its much smaller size (length 64-78cm), lighter build, and long tail.

It feeds mainly on fish, often hunting in groups, and perches in trees between fishing expeditions.

The pygmy cormorant is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an intergovernmental international radio telescope project being built in Australia (low-frequency) and South Africa (mid-frequency). The combining infrastructure, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), and headquarters, are located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the United Kingdom. The SKA cores are being built in the southern hemisphere, where the view of the Milky Way galaxy is the best and radio interference is at its least.

Conceived in the 1990s, and further developed and designed by the late-2010s, when completed a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. It will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. If built as planned, it should be able to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than before. With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least from a concentrated central core, it will exploit radio astronomy&#x27;s ability to provide the highest-resolution images in all astronomy.

The SKAO consortium was founded in Rome in March 2019 by seven initial member countries, with several others subsequently joining; there were 14 members of the consortium. This international organisation is tasked with building and operating the facility. The project has two phases of construction: the current SKA1, commonly just called SKA, and a possible later significantly enlarged phase sometimes called SKA2. The construction phase of the project began on 5 December 2022 in both South Africa and Australia.

== History ==
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) was originally conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. This led to the signing of the first Memorandum of Agreement in 2000.

In the early days of planning, China vied to host the SKA, proposing to build several large dishes in the natural limestone depressions (karst) that dimple its southwestern provinces; China called their proposal Kilometer-square Area Radio Synthesis Telescope (KARST).

Australia&#x27;s first radio quiet zone was established by the Australian Communications and Media Authority on 11 April 2005 specifically to protect and maintain the current &quot;radio-quietness&quot; of the main Australian SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory.

The project has two phases of construction: the current SKA1, commonly just called SKA, and a possible later significantly enlarged phase sometimes called SKA2. PrepSKA commenced in 2008, leading to a full SKA design in 2012. Construction of Phase 1 providing an operational array, with Phase 2 
In April 2011, Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester, in Cheshire, England was announced as the location for the project headquarters. In November 2011, the SKA Organisation was formed as an intergovernmental organisation and the project moved from a collaboration to an independent, not for profit, company.

In February 2012, a former Australian SKA Committee chairman raised concerns with South African media about risks at the Australian candidate site, particularly in terms of cost, mining interference and land agreements. SKA Australia stated that all points had been addressed in the site bid. In March 2012 it was reported that the SKA Site Advisory Committee had made a confidential report in February that the South African bid was stronger. However a scientific working group was set up to explore possible implementation options of the two candidate host regions, and on 25 May 2012 it was announced that it had been determined that the SKA would be split over the South African and African sites, and the Australia and New Zealand sites. While New Zealand remained a member of the SKA Organisation in 2014, it appeared that no SKA infrastructure was likely to be located in New Zealand.

In April 2015, the headquarters of the SKA project were chosen to be located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK, officially opened in July 2019.

Initial construction contracts began in 2018. Scientific observations with the fully completed array 

On 12 March 2019, the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) was founded in Rome by seven initial member countries: Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa and the United Kingdom. India and Sweden are expected to follow shortly, and eight other countries have expressed interest to join in the future. This international organisation was tasked with building and operating the facility, with the first construction contracts 

By mid-2019, the start of scientific observations were expected to start no earlier than 2027. In July 2019, New Zealand withdrew from the project.

, five precursor facilities were already operating: MeerKAT and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) in South Africa, the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Western Australia and the International LOFAR Telescope, spread across Europe with a core in the Netherlands.

The construction phase of the project began on 5 December 2022 in Australia and South Africa, with delegations from each of the eight countries leading the project attending ceremonies to celebrate the event. The Australian part of the project comprises 100,000 antennas built across , also in the Murchison region, in the traditional lands of the Wajarri Aboriginal people. Bulldozers The site has been named , which means in the Wajarri language.

The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in India and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) are investigating the possibility of establishing supercomputing facilities to handle data from the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope. The UK and India are part of the team developing the computational processing for the SKA radio telescope. On 3 January 2024, Indian government approved joining the SKA project accompanied by a financial commitment of ₹1,250 crore which marks the initial step towards ratification as a member state.

== Description ==
The SKA will combine the signals received from thousands of small antennas spread over a distance of several thousand kilometres to simulate a single giant radio telescope capable of extremely high sensitivity and angular resolution, using a technique called aperture synthesis. Some of the sub-arrays of the SKA will also have a very large field-of-view (FOV), making it possible to survey very large areas of sky at once. One innovative development is the use of focal-plane arrays using phased-array technology to provide multiple FOVs. This will greatly increase the survey speed of the SKA and enable several users to observe different pieces of the sky simultaneously, which is useful for (e.g.) monitoring multiple pulsars. The combination of a very large FOV with high sensitivity means that the SKA will be able to compile extremely large surveys of the sky considerably faster than any other telescope.

The combined SKA will provide a wide range of coverage, with Australia&#x27;s Murchison Widefield Array providing low-frequency coverage and South Africa&#x27;s MeerKAT providing mid-frequency coverage. There will be continuous frequency coverage from 50 MHz to 14 GHz in the first two phases of its construction.
* Phase 1: Providing ~10% of the total collecting area at low and mid frequencies by 2023 (SKA1).
* Phase 2: Completion of the full array (SKA2) at low and mid frequencies by 2030.

The frequency range from 50 MHz to 14 GHz, spanning more than two decades, cannot be realised using one design of antenna and so the SKA will comprise separate sub-arrays of different types of antenna elements that will make up the SKA-low, SKA-mid and survey arrays:


# SKA-low array: a phased array of simple dipole antennas to cover the frequency range from 50 to 350 MHz. These will be grouped in 40 m diameter stations each containing 256 vertically oriented dual-polarisation dipole elements. Stations will be arranged with 75% located within a 2 km diameter core and the remaining stations situated on three spiral arms, extending out to a radius of 50 km.
# SKA-mid array: an array of several thousand dish antennas (around 200 to be built in Phase 1) to cover the frequency range 350 MHz to 14 GHz. It is expected that the antenna design will follow that of the Allen Telescope Array using an offset Gregorian design having a height of 15 metres and a width of 12 metres.
# SKA-survey array: a compact array of parabolic dishes of 12–15 meters diameter each for the medium-frequency range, each equipped with a multi-beam, phased array feed with a large field of view and several receiving systems covering about 350 MHz – 4 GHz. The survey sub-array was removed from the SKA1 specification following a &quot;rebaselining&quot; exercise in 2015.

The area covered by the SKA – extending out to ~3000 km – will comprise three regions:
# A central region containing about 5 km diameter cores of SKA-mid antennas (South Africa) and SKA-low dipoles (Western Australia). These central regions will contain approximately half of the total collecting area of the SKA arrays.
# A mid region extending out to 180 km. This will contain dishes and pairs of SKA-mid and SKA-low stations. In each case they will be randomly placed within the area with the density of dishes and stations falling off towards the outer part of the region.
# An outer region from 180 km to 3000 km. This will comprise five spiral arms, along which dishes of SKA-mid, grouped into stations of 20 dishes, will be located. The separation of the stations increases towards the outer ends of the spiral arms.

===Costs===
The SKA was estimated to cost €1.8 billion in 2014, including €650 million for Phase 1, which represented about 10% of the planned capability of the entire telescope array. There have been numerous delays and rising costs over the nearly 30-year history of the intergovernmental project.

, the whole project was reported to be worth around A$3 billion.

, there were 16 countries involved in the project.

==SKA locations ==
The headquarters of the SKA are located at the University of Manchester&#x27;s Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, England, while the telescopes will be installed in Australia and South Africa.

Suitable sites for the SKA telescope must be in unpopulated areas with guaranteed very low levels of man-made radio interference. Four sites were initially proposed in South Africa, Australia, Argentina and China. After considerable site evaluation surveys, Argentina and China were dropped and the other two sites were shortlisted (with New Zealand joining the Australian bid, and 8 other African countries joining the South African bid):

===Australia===
The core site is located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) at Mileura Station near Boolardy in the state of Western Australia, north-east of Geraldton

===South Africa===
The core site is located at the Meerkat National Park, at an elevation of about 1000 metres, in the Karoo area of the arid Northern Cape Province. There are also distant stations in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia.

==Precursors, pathfinders and design studies==
Many groups are working globally to develop the technology and techniques required for the SKA. Their contributions to the international SKA project are classified as either: Precursors, Pathfinders or Design Studies.
* Precursor facility: A telescope on one of the two SKA candidate sites, carrying out SKA-related activity.
* Pathfinder: A telescope or programme carrying out SKA-related technology, science and operations activity.
* Design Study: A study of one or more major sub-systems of the SKA design, including the construction of prototypes

===Precursor facilities===
====Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)====

The Australian SKA Pathfinder, or ASKAP, is an A$100 million project which built a telescope array of thirty-six twelve-metre dishes. It employs advanced, innovative technologies such as phased array feeds to give a wide field of view (30 square degrees). ASKAP was built by CSIRO at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site, located near Boolardy in the mid-west region of Western Australia. All 36 antennas and their technical systems were officially opened in October 2012.

==== MeerKAT ====
MeerKAT is a South African project consisting of an array of sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter dishes as a world class science instrument, and was also built to help develop technology for the SKA.

KAT-7, a seven-dish engineering and science testbed instrument for MeerKAT, in the Meerkat National Park near Carnarvon in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa was commissioned in 2012 and was up and running by May 2018 when all sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter (44.3 feet) dish antennae were completed, with verification tests then underway to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly. The dishes are equipped with a number of high performance single pixel feeds to cover frequencies from 580 MHz up to 14 GHz.

====Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)====

The Murchison Widefield Array is a low-frequency radio array operating in the frequency range 80–300 MHz that began upgraded operation in 2018 at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site in Western Australia.

====Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)====

The HERA array is located in South Africa&#x27;s Meerkat National Park. It is designed to study highly redshifted atomic hydrogen emission emitted prior to, and during the epoch of reionization.

===Pathfinders===
* APERture Tile in Focus (Apertif)
* Very Long Baseline Interferometry
* Electronic MultiBeam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt
* e-MERLIN
* Expanded Very Large Array
* Long Wavelength Array
* SKA Molonglo Prototype (SKAMP)
* NenuFAR
* Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope

====Allen Telescope Array====

The Allen Telescope Array in California uses innovative 6.1m offset Gregorian dishes equipped with wide band single feeds covering frequencies from 500 MHz to 11 GHz. The 42-element array in operation by 2017 is to be extended to 350 elements. The dish design has explored methods of low-cost manufacture.

====LOFAR====

The International LOFAR Telescope —a €150 million Dutch-led project— a novel low-frequency phased aperture array spread over northern Europe. An all-electronic telescope covering low frequencies from 10 to 240 MHz, it came online from 2009 to 2011. LOFAR was in 2017 developing crucial processing techniques for the SKA.. Because of its baselines of up to 2000 km, it can make images with sub-arcsecond angular resolution over a wide field of view. Such high-resolution imaging at low frequencies is unique and will be a factor of more than an order of magnitude better than SKA1-LOW.

===Design studies===

* Aperture Array Verification Programme
* Canadian SKA Program
* Preparatory Study for the SKA
* Square Kilometre Array Design Studies (SKADS)
** Electronic MultiBeam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt (EMBRACE)
** BEST

====Data challenges====
The amount of sensory data collected poses a huge storage problem, and will require real-time signal processing to reduce the raw data to relevant derived information. In mid 2011 it was estimated the array could generate an exabyte a day of raw data, which could be compressed to around 10 petabytes. China, a founding member of the project, has designed and constructed the first prototype of the regional data processing centre. An Tao, head of the SKA group of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, stated, &quot;It will generate data streams far beyond the total Internet traffic worldwide.&quot; The Tianhe-2 supercomputer was used in 2016 to train the software. The processing of the project will be performed on Chinese-designed and -manufactured Virtex-7 processors by Xilinx, integrated into platforms by the CSIRO. China has pushed for a unified beamforming design that has led other major countries to drop out of the project. Canada continues to use Altera Stratix-10 processors (by Intel). It is illegal for any US company to export high end Intel FPGAs or any related CSP design details or firmware to China amid the US-embargo which will severely limit cooperation.

====Technology Development Project (TDP)====
The Technology Development Project, or TDP, is a project to specifically develop dish and feed technology for the SKA. It is operated by a consortium of universities and was completed in 2012.

==Project risks and opposition==
Potential risks for priority astronomical sites in South Africa are protected by the Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act of 2007. Put in place to specifically support the South African SKA bid, it outlaws all activities that could endanger scientific operation of core astronomical instruments. In 2010, concerns were raised over the will to enforce this law when Royal Dutch Shell applied to explore the Karoo for shale gas using hydraulic fracturing, an activity that would have the potential to increase radio interference at the site.

An identified remote station location for the southern African array in Mozambique was subject to flooding and excluded from the project, despite the SKA Site Selection Committee technical analysis reporting that all African remote stations could implement flood mitigation solutions.

During 2014, South Africa experienced a month-long strike action by the National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA), which added to the delays of the installation of dishes.

The largest risk to the overall project is probably its budget, which up until 2014 had not been committed.

There has been opposition to the project from farmers, businesses, and individuals in South Africa since the project&#x27;s inception. The advocacy group called Save the Karoo has stated that the radio quiet zone would create further unemployment in the South African region where unemployment is already above 32%. Farmers had stated that the agriculture-based economy in the Karoo would collapse if they were forced to sell their land.

==Key projects==

The capabilities of the SKA will be designed to address a wide range of questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics, cosmology and particle astrophysics as well as extending the range of the observable universe. A number of key science projects that have been selected for implementation via the SKA are listed below.

===Extreme tests of general relativity===

For almost one hundred years, Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity has precisely predicted the outcome of every experiment made to test it. Most of these tests, including the most stringent ones, have been carried out using radio astronomical measurements. By using pulsars as cosmic gravitational wave detectors, or timing pulsars found orbiting black holes, astronomers will be able to examine the limits of general relativity such as the behaviour of spacetime in regions of extremely curved space. The goal is to reveal whether Einstein was correct in his description of space, time and gravity, or whether alternatives to general relativity are needed to account for these phenomena.

===Galaxies, cosmology, dark matter and dark energy===

The sensitivity of the SKA in the 21 cm hydrogen line will map a billion galaxies out to the edge of the observable Universe. The large-scale structure of the cosmos thus revealed will give constraints to determine the processes resulting in galaxy formation and evolution. Imaging hydrogen throughout the Universe will provide a three-dimensional picture of the first ripples of structure that formed individual galaxies and clusters. This may also allow the measurement of effects hypothetically caused by dark energy and causing the increasing rate of expansion of the universe.

The cosmological measurements enabled by SKA galaxy surveys include testing models of dark energy, gravity, the primordial universe, and fundamental cosmology, and they are summarised in a series of papers available online.

===Epoch of re-ionization===
The SKA is intended to provide observational data from the so-called Dark Ages (between 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe became cool enough for hydrogen to become neutral and decouple from radiation) and the time of First Light (a billion years later when young galaxies are seen to form for the first time and hydrogen becomes ionized again). By observing the primordial distribution of gas, the SKA should be able to see how the Universe gradually lit up as its stars and galaxies formed and then evolved. This period of the Dark Ages, culminating in First Light, is considered the first chapter in the cosmic story of creation, and the resolving power required to see this event is the reason for the Square Kilometre Array&#x27;s design. To see back to First Light requires a telescope 100 times more powerful than the biggest radio telescopes currently in the world, taking up 1 million square metres of collecting area, or one square kilometre.

===Cosmic magnetism===
It is still not possible to answer basic questions about the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields, but it is clear that they are an important component of interstellar and intergalactic space. By mapping the effects of magnetism on the radiation from very distant galaxies, the SKA will investigate the form of cosmic magnetism and the role it has played in the evolving Universe.

===Search for extraterrestrial life===
This key science program, called &quot;Cradle of Life&quot;, will focus on three objectives: observing protoplanetary discs in habitable zones, searching for prebiotic chemistry, and contributing to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).
*The SKA will be able to probe the habitable zone of Sun-like protostars, where Earth-like planets or moons are most likely to have environments favourable for the development of life. The signatures of forming Earth-like planets imprinted on circumstellar dust may be the most conspicuous evidence of their presence and evolution, and may even detect planets capable of supporting life.
*Astrobiologists will also use the SKA to search for complex organic compounds (carbon-containing chemicals) in outer space, including amino acids, by identifying spectral lines at specific frequencies.
*The SKA will be capable of detecting extremely weak radio emission &quot;leakage&quot; from nearby extraterrestrial civilizations, if they exist.

<text>Demerara (; , ) is a historical region in the Guianas, on the north coast of South America, now part of the country of Guyana. It was a colony of the Dutch West India Company between 1745 and 1792 and a colony of the Dutch state from 1792 until 1815. It was merged with Essequibo in 1812 by the British who took control. It formally became a British colony in 1815 until Demerara-Essequibo was merged with Berbice to form the colony of British Guiana in 1831. In 1838, it became a county of British Guiana until 1958. In 1966, British Guiana gained independence as Guyana and in 1970 it became a republic as the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. It was located around the lower course of the Demerara River, and its main settlement was Georgetown.

The name &quot;Demerara&quot; comes from a variant of the Arawak word or , which means &quot;river of the letter wood&quot; (wood of &quot;Brosimum guianense&quot; tree). Demerara sugar is so named because originally, it came from sugarcane fields in the colony of Demerara.

==History==
Demerara was first mentioned in 1691 as a trading post. On 18 October 1745, Demerara was created as a separate colony, even though it was located on an unoccupied part of Essequibo, because the people from the province of Holland wanted to settle there and Essequibo was part of Zeeland. In the founding documents, it was mentioned that the colonists should live in peace with the Amerindian population and respect their territories, because they fought with the colony of Essequibo against the French privateers and helped to chase them off. The Amerindians were considered free people, and they were not allowed to enslave them.

The first planter was Andries Pieterse who already owned a plantation in Essequibo. Half a year later, there were 18 large sugar plantations and 50 smaller plantations. The colony was initially governed from Fort Zeelandia by Laurens Storm van &#x27;s Gravesande, the governor of Essequibo. In 1750 he appointed his son Jonathan as Commander of Demerara.

Demerara grew rapidly, and attracted many English planters. The Dutch West India Company, who had a monopoly on the slave trade, was unable to supply them, leading to illegal smuggling from English colonies.

In 1755, Gedney Clarke, a Barbados merchant and plantation owner, requested political representation, therefore the administration was moved to the island of Borsselen, upriver near plantation Soesdyke which was owned by the commander of Demerara. The decision was criticised because the island was hard to defend, and the planters had started to build houses around the guard post near the mouth of the river. That settlement later became known as Stabroek, and in 1782 the capital of the colony. The town was renamed Georgetown in 1812.

In 1763, a slave uprising took place in neighbouring Berbice. Governor van &#x27;s Gravesande formed an alliance with the Amerindian Arawak, Kalina, Warao and Akawaio tribes, and prevented the uprising from spreading to Demerara and Essequibo. 50 soldiers from Demarara were sent to Berbice as assistance. The slave uprisings were a source of concern: in a 1767 letter to Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, which aimed to promote the colony for German planters, a request was added for 100 soldiers.

In 1780, there were almost 200 plantations in Demerara compared to 129 in Essequibo. Demerara had become more successful than Essequibo. The rivalry between the colonies resulted in the creation of a combined Court of Policy in Fort Zeelandia. The majority of the white population of the colony were English and Scottish planters.

===Conquest and reconquest===
In 1781, the American revolution induced the Dutch Republic to join with the Bourbon side against the British. A large fleet under Admiral Lord Rodney&#x27;s command was sent to the West Indies, and after having made some seizures in the Caribbean Islands, a squadron was detached to take possession of the colonies of Essequibo and Demerara, which was accomplished without even a fight. The previous year, the colony produced 10,000 hogsheads of sugar, 5,000,000 pounds coffee and 800,000 pounds cotton.

In 1782 the French took possession of the whole of the Dutch settlements, compelling Gov. Robert Kingston to surrender. The opinion of the Dutch newspapers varied. The &quot;Leeuwarder Courant&quot; called it the loss of our Demerary, while the &quot;Hollandsche historische courant&quot; described it as a pleasant reconquest. The Treaty of Paris (1783) restored these territories to the Dutch.

The British recaptured Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice in 1796. A deal was struck with the colony: all laws and customs could remain, and the citizens were equal to British subjects. Any government official who swore loyalty to the British crown could remain in function. They returned the colony to the Dutch in 1802 under the terms of the Peace of Amiens, but re-took control of it a year later.

On 28 April 1812, the British combined the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. They were ceded to Britain on 13 August 1814. On 20 November 1815, the Netherlands ratified the agreement.

===Slave rebellion===

Large slave rebellions broke out in West Demerara in 1795 and on the East Coast of Demerara in 1823. Although these rebellions were easily and bloodily crushed, according to Winston McGowan, they may have had a long-term impact in ending slavery:

===Dissolution===
On 21 July 1831, Demerara-Essequibo united with Berbice as British Guiana, now Guyana. In 1838, Demerara was made one of the three counties of Guiana, the other two being Berbice and Essequibo. In 1958, the county was abolished when Guiana was subdivided into districts. Historical Demerara was divided in 1958 and are a part of Guyanese administrative regions of Demerara-Mahaica, Essequibo Islands-West Demerara, and Upper Demerara-Berbice.

<text>Guruvayur ) is a municipal temple town in Thrissur district, of Kerala State in India. It is a suburban town of Thrissur city, located from Thrissur towards the north-west. It houses the Guruvayur Shri Krishna Temple. It is located at a distance of from the state capital Trivandrum towards the north-west, from Kochi towards the north, from Calicut towards south.

==Etymology==
According to Hindu legend, the deity Krishna is said to have asked a deity and a sage to take the idol from his temple in Dvaraka before it was destroyed by a flood, and establish it in Kerala. Accordingly, the idol of Krishna is believed to have been brought by the wind deity Vayu and Sage Brihaspati and was placed in Guruvayur. The name Guruvayur is a portmanteau of their names: &quot;Guru&quot; referring to the title of Brihaspati, &quot;Vayu&quot; referring to the deity. &quot;Ur&quot; is a Malayalam suffix that means city or settlement.

==Demographics==
In 2010, the Municipal limits were expanded by merging nearby Pookode and Thaikkad panchayats. The Municipality consists of Perakam (CT) village, Pookode Village, Iringappuram(CT) Village, Thaikkad(CT) Village, Chavakkad Village, and Guruvayur Village part, revenue villages of Chavakkad Taluk. Thus, the total area of Municipality is 29.66 square kilometers comprising 43 wards with 67,006 population and population density of 2,259 per square kilometre.

==Government==

Later the wards were increased to 10 and in 1994 to 20 when the township was upgraded to Municipality status with an area of . In 2010, the electoral wards were increased to 43. Guruvayur is a Grade-1 Municipality. Guruvayur assembly constituency is part of Trichur (Lok Sabha constituency).

===Festivals===

====Guruvayur Ekadashi====
Ekadashi, the eleventh day of every lunar fortnight, is very auspicious to the Hindus. Of the 24 Ekadashis in a year, the Vrishchika Ekadashi (Sukla paksha) has got special significance in Guruvayur temple. A memorial honour for Gajarajan Keshavan is conducted in Guruvayur. The Karanavar or head of the elephant family places a wreath at the statue of Keshavan in front of Sreevalsam guest house and all the other elephants stand around and pay obeisance. On Ekadashi day, the Udayasthamana Pooja (dawn to dusk pooja) is conducted by the Devaswom itself . After the morning seeveli, on Ekadashi there is a grand elephant procession to the Parthasarathi temple since it is regarded as Geethopadesam Day also. On Ekadashi after night pooja, the famous Ekadashi Vilakku with elephant procession takes place and provides a fitting finale to the festival.

===Chembai Sangeetholsavam===

Chembai Sangeetholsavam is an annual Carnatic music festival held in Guruvayur by the Guruvayur Devaswom as a kind of homage to Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, one of the titans of Carnatic Classical Music. Chembai had conducted the festival in the temple town on his own for about 60 years. He used to invite all the great Carnatic Musicians to perform in the temple town and in course of time, the scale of the festival rivalled the Thyagaraja Aradhana at Thiruvaiyaru, which is recognised as one of the most important festivals of homage paid to Saint Thyagaraja.

The Guruvayur Devaswom decided to take charge after his death in 1974, and renamed it as Chembai Sangeetholsavam in his memory. About 2000-2500 musicians participate in this festival every year, and it is held for about 12–15 days culminating on the Guruvayur Ekadashi day, when all the musicians sing 5 favourite songs of Chembai and also the Pancharatna Kritis of Thyagaraja.

<doc id="792289" wikidata="Q7683912" url="?curid=792289" title="Tanunda Liedertafel">
<text>The Tanunda Liedertafel is a 45-member male choir in Tanunda, South Australia. Drawing its four-part (TTBB) singing material from traditional popular German culture. The group&#x27;s origins date back to 1850, based on an entry in &quot;The South Australian&quot; (10 January 1851). Previously, the choir researchers had only been able to confirm back to 1861 based on a surviving music book case with the words &quot;Tanunda Liedertafel 1861&quot; painted on its metal lid, and a report in the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; of a concert in Tanunda dated 22 October 1861 .

The members were also instrumental in the formation of a &quot;German Club&quot; in Tanunda in 1855, proving the continuous nature of the choir from 1850 to World War 1.

The choir was re-organized in 1920 and, aside from an interruption caused by World War II has been active ever since, primarily in Tanunda and Adelaide. Along with third- and fourth-generation German-Australians, the group includes singers with Dutch, British, Polish and Irish backgrounds. Given the nationalities of the members, nearly 50 percent of the material sung is in English or Latin (where tradition dictates).

Many of their performances are for charity. An annual event is the &quot;Kaffee Abend&quot; in mid-November (October 2013 being the only known exception). Over the years, fundraising concerts have raised finances for the (now) Tanunda Hospital, and very substantial funds for the original construction and later extensions for the (now) Tanunda Soldier&#x27;s Memorial Hall. Another worthy recipient was the United Nations Appeal for Children (U.N.A.C.).

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has recorded the Liedertafel several times since 1932. The choir first performed on television in 1961 for its centenary. It has also appeared on programs broadcast in Germany.

In 1963, Tanunda Liedertafel performed for Queen Elizabeth II in Elder Park, Adelaide. In 2001, it performed in Adelaide for US President Bill Clinton.

Awards have included the Zelter Plaque (1980).

The choir also attends Saengerfest(s), this is where groups of choirs (similar to the Tanunda Liedertafel) come together for a weekend of traditional German and Austrian song. The first of these was held in Tanunda in 1874, then again in 1991 and again in 2011. A more recent Saengerfest was held in Canberra, Australia in October 2014.

Practices are held for two hours each Tuesday night, at The Tanunda Soldier&#x27;s Memorial Hall (Barossa Gallery) eleven months out of the year (although members are no longer fined three pence for tardiness, or six pence for non-attendance).

<text>Judith Eva Barsi (June 6, 1978 – July 25, 1988) was an American child actress. She began her career in television, making appearances in commercials and television series, as well as the 1987 film &quot;&quot;. She also provided the voices of Ducky in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; and Anne-Marie in &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;, both released after her death. She and her mother, Maria, were killed in July 1988 in a double murder–suicide committed in their home by her father, József Barsi.

== Early life ==
Barsi was born in Los Angeles County, California, on June 6, 1978, the daughter of József Istvan Barsi and Maria Barsi (née Virovacz), both immigrants to the U.S. who fled the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic following the 1956 uprising. The two immigrated at different times and met at a restaurant in California, where Maria worked as a waitress. Both had been previously married.

== Career ==
Maria Barsi began preparing her daughter to become an actress when Judith was five. Barsi&#x27;s first role was in &quot;Fatal Vision&quot;, playing Kimberley MacDonald. She went on to appear in more than seventy commercials and guest roles on television. As well as her career in television, she appeared in several films, including &quot;.&quot; She provided the voices of Ducky in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, and Anne-Marie in &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;.

By the time she began fourth grade, Barsi was earning an estimated $100,000 per year () allowing her family to buy a three-bedroom house in West Hills, Los Angeles. As she was short for her age—she was at age 10—she began receiving hormone injections at UCLA to encourage her growth. Her petiteness led casting directors to cast her in roles as children who were younger than her actual age. Her agent Ruth Hansen was quoted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as saying that when she was ten, &quot;she was still playing 7, 8 (years of age).&quot;

== Abuse and death ==
As Barsi&#x27;s career success increased, her father József, an alcoholic, became increasingly angry, and repeatedly threatened to kill himself, his wife, and his daughter. He was arrested three times for drunk driving. Before Judith left to film &quot;Jaws: The Revenge&quot;, József reportedly held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her if she didn&#x27;t return. In December 1986, Maria reported his threats and physical violence against her to the police. After the police found no physical signs of abuse, she decided not to press charges against him. 

After the incident with the police, József reportedly stopped drinking, but continued to threaten Maria and Judith with violence, including threats to burn down the house. He also reportedly hid a telegram informing Maria that a relative in Hungary had died, hoping to prevent her from leaving the United States with Judith. The physical violence continued, with Barsi telling a friend that her father threw pots and pans at her, resulting in a nosebleed. As a result of being abused, Judith Barsi began gaining weight and developed compulsive behaviors, such as plucking out her eyelashes and pulling out her cat&#x27;s whiskers. In May 1988, after breaking down in front of her agent, Ruth Hansen, Judith was taken by Maria to a child psychologist, who identified severe physical and emotional abuse and reported her findings to child protective services.

The investigation was dropped after Maria assured the case worker that she intended to begin divorce proceedings against József and that she and Judith were going to move into a Panorama City apartment she had recently rented as a daytime haven from him. Maria&#x27;s friends urged her to follow through on the plan, but she hesitated for fear of losing the family home and belongings.

Months before her murder, Barsi had reportedly told friends, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid to go home [...] My daddy is miserable. My daddy is drunk every day and I know he wants to kill my mother.&quot;

On July 28, 1988, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that three people had been found dead in an apparent murder–suicide and that the bodies were believed to be those of Barsi, her mother Maria, and her father József. József shot Maria in the hallway of their home and Judith in her bed. The article quoted Police Lt. Warren Knowles as saying that a flammable liquid, presumably gasoline, had been poured on the bodies of Maria and Judith by József. József&#x27;s body was found in the garage; he had died from what was determined to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Neighbor Eunice Daly said that she had heard a gunshot around 8:30a.m. on July 27, prompting her to call the police. Barsi and her mother were buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in adjoining plots.
== Since 1988 ==
Both &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; and &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; were released after her death. In an interview, Don Bluth, the director of both films praised her as being &quot;absolutely astonishing. She understood verbal direction, even for the most sophisticated situations&quot;. Bluth had remarked on the difficulty in finding child actors for roles and had intended to continue to feature her extensively in his future productions.

<text>The Federation of the Greens (, FdV), frequently referred to as Greens (&quot;Verdi&quot;), was a green political party in Italy. It was formed in 1990 by the merger of the Federation of Green Lists and the Rainbow Greens.

The FdV was part of the European Green Party and the Global Greens. In July 2021 it was merged into Green Europe.

==History==
===Background and foundation===
The Federation of Green Lists was formed in 1984 by leading environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists, notably including Gianni Mattioli, Gianfranco Amendola, Massimo Scalia and Alexander Langer.

The party made its debut at the 1987 general election and obtained 2.6% of the vote, gaining 13 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and two senators. Later that year, the Greens successfully campaigned for three referendums aimed at stopping nuclear power in Italy, which had been proposed by the left-liberal Radical Party and was eventually supported by the country&#x27;s three main parties (Christian Democrats, Communists and Socialists).

At the 1989 European Parliament election there were two competing green parties: the LV and the Rainbow Greens (VA), formed mainly by Radicals, including Adelaide Aglietta, Franco Corleone, Adele Faccio, Marco Taradash and Francesco Rutelli, as well as splinters from Proletarian Democracy, including Mario Capanna, Guido Pollice, Gianni Tamino and Edo Ronchi. The two lists obtained a combined 6.2% of the vote, of which 3.8% for the LV and 2.4% for the VA, and 5 MEPs.

In 1990 the two parties joined forces to form the Federation of the Greens, which inherited from the LV the Smiling Sun symbol of the northern European anti-nuclear movement, designed by Danish activist Anne Lund in 1975. In the 1992 general election the new party won 2.8% of the vote, returning 16 deputies and 4 senators. The party was briefly a member of the Ciampi Cabinet formed 28 April 1993, its sole minister resigning a day after the cabinet&#x27;s swearing-in ceremony.

===Centre-left coalitions===
In 1993 the Greens joined forces with the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) within the Alliance of Progressives, a broad left-wing coalition. As a result, Rutelli was elected mayor of Rome. The party was also joined by Carlo Ripa di Meana, a former Socialist member of the European Commission and minister of the Environment, who became the party&#x27;s leader.

In the 1994 European Parliament election won 3.2% of the vote and three MEPs, its best result as a joint party.

In 1995 the Greens were a founding member of The Olive Tree coalition and in the 1996 general election, thanks to this alliance and several candidates in single-seat constituencies, they obtained 14 deputies and 14 senators, their highest number ever. Following the election, the Greens the centre-left governments led by Romano Prodi, Massimo D&#x27;Alema and Giuliano Amato. Ronchi was minister of the Environment (1996–2000) and Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio minister of Agriculture (2000–2001).

Since 1996 the party however started a slow decline. Some of its leading members left: Rutelli (who was re-elected mayor of Rome) in 1997 and Ripa di Meana in 1998. The party also suffered the competition of several centre-left parties, some of them new as The Democrats, of which Rutelli was a founding member. In the 1999 European Parliament election the Greens were reduced to 1.8% and two MEPs, prompting the resignation of Luigi Manconi, who had led the party since 1996. The party was thus re-organised under Grazia Francescato, a former president of the Italy&#x27;s section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

At the 2001 general election the Greens formed a joint list with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI): The Sunflower. The combination scored 2.2%, thus failing to surpass the 4% threshold. The Greens elected seven deputies and ten senators in single-member constituencies, as part of The Olive Tree coalition.

===Shift to the far left===
After the alliance with the SDI, a relatively centrist party, the Greens shifted far to the left, prompting the exit of leading members as Ronchi, Mattioli, Scalia, Corleone and Manconi. The Greens were since part of the so-called &quot;radical left&quot;, along with the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC) and the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI).

At the 2004 European Parliament election the Greens obtained 2.5% of the vote and two MEPs.

In February 2005 the Greens joined The Union, the new successor alliance to The Olive Tree, with party secretary Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio receiving 2.2% of the vote in the open primary election for the coalition&#x27;s leader. At the 2006 general election the party was part of the winning coalition The Union, and scored 2.1%, obtained 15 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The Together with the Union list, an alliance of Greens, Communists and Consumers polled 4.2% in the election for the Senate, electing 11 senators, 5 of whom were Greens. In 2006–2008 Pecoraro Scanio served as minister of the Environment, while Paolo Cento, national coordinator of the party and leader of the &quot;no global&quot; faction, was undersecretary of Economy and Finances.

In November 2006 Pecoraro Scanio&#x27;s political line was confirmed in a party congress, but the Greens also tried to re-open the doors to all former members. The attempt of re-uniting the Italian Greens failed as soon as in January 2007, when Mattioli, Scalia and Corleone finally left the party again, citing that it was drifting too much the far left, and announced their intention to participate to the foundation of the Democratic Party (PD). Within the PD, they joined the Democratic Ecologists&#x27; faction, which already included several former Greens (Manconi, Ronchi, Lino De Benetti, Stefano Semenzato, Ermete Realacci, Gianni Vernetti, Franco Piro, Francesco Ferrante, Carla Rocchi, etc.). As a result, &quot;Legambiente&quot;, the largest environmentalist association of Italy, showed more support for the PD than the Greens themselves.

===Out of Parliament===
In the run-up of the 2008 general election, the Greens participated in the foundation of The Left – The Rainbow electoral list with the PRC, the PdCI and Democratic Left (SD). The coalition obtained just 3.1% of the vote and the Greens lost their parliamentary representation.

In the summer of 2008 Grazia Francescato, who had been leader before, represented the party&#x27;s establishment and in the event was supported by Cento&#x27;s left-wing, was elected at the helm of the party, by defeating two modernizers, Marco Boato and Fabio Roggiolani.

For the 2009 election the Greens formed a joint list with the Movement for the Left (MpS) – a moderate split from the PRC –, the Socialist Party (PS) – successor of the SDI –, SD and Unite the Left (UlS): Left and Freedom (SL). The list received just 3.1% of the vote and failed to return any MEPs. After the election, it was decided to transform SL into a permanent federation, that would eventually evolve into the joint party named Left Ecology Freedom (SEL), and Francescato wanted the Greens to join it.

However, during a party congress in October 2009 the party rejected the proposal by narrowly electing Angelo Bonelli, candidate of the liberal faction led by Boato, instead of Francescato&#x27;s candidate, Loredana De Petris. After his election, which marked the end of the dominance of the internal left wing over the party, Bonelli announced that the party will pursue an independent course from SL, and will try to coalesce a new &quot;ecologist constituent assembly&quot; on the model of the French Europe Écologie. Francescato, De Petris and Cento continued to support SL as the Ecologists Association and would eventually leave the Greens.

===New coalitions===
In September 2010 the Greens launched an Ecologist Constituent Assembly. In Bonelli&#x27;s view the new political force would take inspiration both from the French &quot;Verts&quot; and the German &quot;Grünen&quot; and would be open to the contribution of movements and associations, notably including Beppe Grillo&#x27;s Five Star Movement (M5S). Other than the Greens, participants of the new political force included, among others, Massimo Scalia (a former leading Green), Bruno Mellano (president of the Italian Radicals), movie maker Mario Monicelli, writer Dacia Maraini, geologist Mario Tozzi and comedian Giobbe Covatta. As a result, in November 2011 the Ecologists and Civic Networks (&quot;Ecologisti e Reti Civiche&quot;, ERC) coalition was officially launched, but it would be just a short-lived experiment.

In 2012 Bonelli stood as candidate for mayor of Taranto, garnering 11.9% of the vote.

In the 2013 general election the Greens were part of the Civil Revolution coalition, which obtained a mere 2.2% of the vote and no seats. In May the ERC was disbanded and in November, during a party congress, Luana Zanella was elected to serve as co-spokesperson along with Bonelli.

The Greens contested the 2014 European Parliament election with Green Italia (GI), a green party established in 2013 and led by Monica Frassoni and Fabio Granata, within the joint list European Greens – Green Italia. The electoral list received 0.9% of the vote and did not return any MEPs.

In January 2015 senator Bartolomeo Pepe, a former member of the M5S, joined the party, giving it parliamentary representation after seven years. In June another former senator of the M5S, Paola De Pin, joined the Greens and sat with senator Pepe within the Great Autonomies and Freedom group. Both Pepe and De Pin would soon leave the party. Another former M5S senator, Cristina De Pietro, would join the Greens in November 2016 and leave next year.

In November 2015, during a party congress, Covatta was elected spokesperson, succeeding to Bonelli and Zanella. However, Covatta&#x27;s role was soon transformed into that of a testimonial. In February 2017 the party appointed Bonelli and Fiorella Zabatta to serve as day-to-day coordinators and Zanella as international secretary. Later that year, the coordinators were three: Bonelli, Zanella and, representing the party&#x27;s minority, Gianluca Carrabs.

===Return to the centre-left===
In December 2017, in an internal referendum, 73% of Green members voted in favour of their party&#x27;s return to the moderate centre-left coalition led by the PD. Consequently, the Greens formed, along with the Italian Socialist Party and Civic Area, the Together electoral list for the 2018 general election. When the results came in, the list had obtained a mere 0.6% of the vote and no seats; additionally, no Green was elected in single-seat constituencies. After the election, Bonelli resigned from the executive and the remaining two coordinators, Zanella and Carrabs, led the transition.

In December 2018, during a party congress, Matteo Badiali and Elena Grandi, supported by Bonelli and Zanella, were elected co-spokespersons of the party.

In the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament election the party formed Green Europe (EV), a joint electoral list with Italy in Common (IiC) and GI. The alliance was reinforced by Marco Affronte, who had been elected with the M5S in 2014 and had joined as an independent the Greens–European Free Alliance group and the European Green Party, and eventually announced on Facebook that he had joined the FdV. However, IiC soon left the Greens in order to form an alternative alliance with More Europe, a liberal party. The list received 2.3% of the vote, quite an improvement from 2014, but still not enough to exceed the 4% threshold.

In the 2020 Italian regional elections a re-edition of Green Europe won seats in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Marche and Campania. Together with the seat won in Trentino in 2018, the Greens had a total of 5 seats in Regional Councils, their best result in terms of representation in a decade.

In March 2021 Rossella Muroni (GI) left the Free and Equal group in order to establish, along with Lorenzo Fioramonti (GI, former M5S), Alessandro Fusacchia (Italian Radicals, former +E), Andrea Cecconi (ex-M5S) and Antonio Lombardo (ex-M5S), a sub-group of the FdV within the Mixed Group instead.

In July 2021 the FdV was merged into EV.

==Popular support==
In their history the Greens were never able to reach the electoral success of many green parties all around Europe. They had a stable share of vote around 2% and experienced a slight decline in the 2010s. Their characterization as party of the far left did not help them in northern Italy, where they had their best results at the beginning (for instance 7.1% in the 1990 Venetian regional election).

The Greens were stronger in cities and urban areas (Milan, Venice, Rome, Naples, etc.), in northern mountain regions, such as Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (especially in South Tyrol, where they were organised in the local Greens, a broader left-wing party) and Aosta Valley (where the local section, the Alternative Greens, were merged into Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology in 2010), and in some southern regions, such as Basilicata and Campania.

Rhymney is known to many outside Wales as a result of the song &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;, a musical adaptation of a poem by Idris Davies.

== Etymology ==
The town is named after the Rhymney River, whose name derives from the Welsh word &#x27; &quot;auger&quot; + &#x27;, a derivational noun ending.

==History==
The countryside around present day Rhymney would have been very different in the early 17th century. In 1624 the parish of Bedwellty was created which covered the lower division of the Wentloog Hundred, in the county of Monmouth, a hilly district between the river Rumney, on the West and the Sirhowey on the East. The upper Sirhowy Valley at this time would have been a natural well wooded valley, consisting of a few farms and the occasional small iron works where iron ore and coal naturally had occurred together. Later it would have contained the chapelries of Rhymney and Tredegar, the latter being known as a market town. It was not until the 1750s that industrialisation began with the establishment of the Sirhowy Iron Works. 

The town was founded with the establishment of the Union ironworks in 1801, with the Rhymney Iron Company later being founded from a merger between the Bute and Union Ironworks in 1837. The ironworks used local coking coal, iron ore and limestone. From the mid-19th century, steam coal pits were sunk to the south of the town. The ironworks closed in 1891 and by the early 20th century the town&#x27;s collieries employed nearly the entire local population.

The parish church of Rhymney is a Grade II listed building that was constructed in the neo-classical style. It was built by architect Philip Hardwick from London on commission for Andrew Buchan who was the manager of the local Rhymney brewery between 1838–1858. The building was listed in 1990 and was noted for being one of the most &#x27;interesting&#x27; examples of neoclassical architecture in South Wales. Buchan himself is buried in the parish church vaults and is commemorated with a plaque in the nave of the church. The parish is occasionally visited by enthusiasts of Hardwick&#x27;s work who are interested in neo-classical buildings of this type.

The history of Rhymney is described in &quot;Rhymney Memories,&quot; a book by Dr Thomas Jones. Jones was born in the town and his daughter, the Labour Party politician Eirene White, was later granted the title Baroness White of Rhymney.

==Education and transport==
The town&#x27;s secondary school, Idris Davies School, serves a catchment area that includes Fochriw, Pontlottyn and New Tredegar. There is also a Welsh language primary school in Rhymney.

In 1999, Ystrad Mynach College launched its sister campus in Rhymney to serve the top end of the Rhymney Valley under the name The College Rhymney. The College Rhymney underwent rapid growth after its opening, with over 700 students enrolling on various courses in the 2007–2008 academic year. The College Rhymney is now permanently closed.

Rhymney railway station is on the Rhymney Line. Featured on the Rhymney Line is a viaduct that was built by the Rhymney Railway company to facilitate the line in 1857 after the incorporation of the company to build the line to the steel works in 1854. The viaduct which opened in 1858 was designed by English engineer Joseph Cubitt.(1811–1872).

The celebrated Welsh poet Idris Davies (1905–1953) was born in Rhymney. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked as a miner in the nearby Abertysswg and Rhymney Mardy Pits. After participating in the failed General Strike of 1926, Davies moved to London where he worked as a teacher at various schools. Four volumes of his poetry were published during his lifetime: &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; (1938), &quot;The Angry Summer: A Poem of 1926&quot; (1943), &quot;Tonypandy and other poems&quot; (1945), and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1953). He returned to Rhymney in 1947 and died of cancer on 6 April 1953.

General manager and engineer of the Rhymney Railway Cornelius Lundie (1815–1908). For over 40 years, he was, a few years prior to his death, appointed consulting director to the Company, and actively discharged the duties of that office until the very end. As an engineer he designed and constructed many extensions of the system and widenings of the main line, including a double-way tunnel under the Cefn On or Caerphilly mountain, and a masonry viaduct of seven spans over the River Taff, besides new locomotive shops at Caerphilly, and other works. He was 93 when he died in 1908 and is thought to be the oldest railway director of his time.

The professor, civil servant, administrator, and author Dr Thomas Jones (1870–1955) was also born in Rhymney. After leaving school at 14 he became a clerk at the Rhymney Iron and Steel Works. He was admitted to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1890 and later migrated to Glasgow University in 1890. Between 1904 and 1905 he lectured in Ireland and upon returning to Wales in 1910 became Secretary of the Welsh National Campaign against Tuberculosis. He was appointed Secretary of the National Health Insurance Commission (Wales) in 1912 and transferred to London in 1916 as Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet, eventually becoming Deputy Secretary. He suffered a serious fall indoors at his home in Kent in June 1955 and died in a private nursing home on 15 October 1955.

Notable people born in Rhymney include the Major League Baseball trainer John D. Reese, Wales international rugby union Wing Tom James, and Professor W. John Morgan, Commonwealth Scholarship Commissioner, and Chair of the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO.https://www.ukwhoswho.com/

One of the largest employers in Rhymney is Williams Medical Supplies.

The town is home to the Rhymney Silurian Male Choir, which was formed in 1951 to renew the tradition of male voice singing in Rhymney. During its history, the choir has won four National Eisteddfod titles and raised money for a number of charities.

==&quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;==

Rhymney is known to many outside Wales due to folk singer Pete Seeger&#x27;s song &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;. The lyrics to the song are drawn from a poem by Idris Davies, and the poem was first published in Davies&#x27; 1938 anthology &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot;. The poem was inspired by the failure of the 1926 General Strike and by the Marine Colliery disaster of 1 March 1927. In addition to Rhymney, the poem also refers to the bells of Merthyr, Rhondda, Blaina, Caerphilly, Neath, Brecon, Swansea, Newport, Cardiff and the Wye Valley.

The song has been covered by a number of acts over the years, including Judy Collins, Cher, the Alarm, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, John Denver, Robyn Hitchcock, Oysterband and Ralph McTell. Arguably the most widely known rendition of the song, however, was that recorded by the American band the Byrds for their 1965 album &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.

<doc id="792318" wikidata="Q943062" url="?curid=792318" title="Norio Wakamoto">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor affiliated with the Sigma Seven talent agency. He was born in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and was raised in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture. He graduated from Waseda University.

On adult works, like OVAs or dating sims, he goes by the alias .

==Biography==
Wakamoto studied in Waseda University under the Faculty of Law. During his time there, he participated in Shorin Kempo activities.

Wakamoto entered the Nakano Police Academy, intending to become a police officer. He sought advice from a career counselor after his professor did not agree with his plans to do graduate studies. He was later assigned to his first post at the Kuramae Police Station. Later on, he was assigned to be in an anti-riot unit and was deployed to arrest rioters participating the Shinjuku riot in 1968. Wakamoto became disillusioned with his duties and decided to leave.

Wakamoto joined the Consumers Union of Japan after leaving the force. But he got into trouble at times as he did his work without getting approval from his superiors.

According to Wakamoto, he decided to do voice work, starting from dubbing foreign movies, when he saw an ad calling for applications to Ryo Kurosawa&#x27;s training school after he left the union due to a fight with his boss while drunk. Tohokushinsha&#x27;s dubbing director, Kanji Nakano, encouraged him to go into voice acting despite uncertainties if he would be able to get potential work as a voice actor.

<doc id="792360" wikidata="Q182761" url="?curid=792360" title="Hazel grouse">
<text>The hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia), sometimes called the hazel hen, is one of the smaller members of the grouse family of birds. It is a sedentary species, breeding across the Palearctic as far east as Hokkaido, and as far west as eastern and central Europe, in dense, damp, mixed coniferous woodland, preferably with some spruce. The bird is sometimes referred to as &quot;rabchick&quot; (from рябчик) by early 20th century English speaking travellers to Russia.

==Taxonomy==
The hazel grouse was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao bonasia&quot;. Although Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe, this is restricted to Sweden. The hazel grouse is now placed with the Chinese grouse in the genus &quot;Tetrastes&quot; that was introduced in 1840 by Alexander von Keyserling and Johann Heinrich Blasius. The specific epithet &quot;bonasia&quot; is Modern Latin for the hazel grouse, from the Italian name for the species.

Eleven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. b. rhenanus&quot; (Kleinschmidt, 1917) – northeast France, Luxembourg, Belgium and west Germany
* &quot;T. b. styriacus&quot; (von Jordans &amp; Schiebel, 1944) – Alps, south Poland to Hungary
* &quot;T. b. schiebeli&quot; (Kleinschmidt, 1943) – Balkan Peninsula
* &quot;T. b. rupestris&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1831) – south Germany and Czech Rep.
* &quot;T. b. bonasia&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – west, south Scandinavia and central Poland east to the Ural Mountains (Russia)
* &quot;T. b. griseonota&quot; Salomonsen, 1947 – north Sweden
* &quot;T. b. sibiricus&quot; Buturlin, 1916 – northeast Russia, north, central Siberia and north Mongolia
* &quot;T. b. kolymensis&quot; Buturlin, 1916 – east Siberia
* &quot;T. b. amurensis&quot; Riley, 1916 – northeast China to north Korea Peninsula
* &quot;T. b. yamashinai&quot; Momiyama, 1928 – Sakhalin (Russia)
* &quot;T. b. vicinitas&quot; Riley, 1915 – Hokkaido (Japan)

==Description==
This is a relatively small grouse at length. The plumage of this plump bird is finely patterned, but it essentially has grey upperparts, brown wings and chestnut flecked white underparts.

The male has a short erectile crest and a white-bordered black throat. The female has a shorter crest and lacks the black color on the throat. In flight, this species shows a black-tipped grey tail.

The male has a high-pitched &quot;ti-ti-ti-ti-ti&quot; call, and the female a liquid &quot;tettettettettet&quot;. These calls, along with the burr of the flying birds&#x27; wings, are often the only indication of this grouse&#x27;s presence, since its shyness and dense woodland habitat make it difficult to see.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
This bird feeds on the ground, taking mainly plant food, supplemented by insects when breeding.

===Breeding===
These birds nest on the ground, with 3–6 eggs being the normal clutch size. The female incubates the eggs and cares for the chicks alone, as is typical with gamebirds.

<text>Under My Skin is a 1950 American sports drama film directed by Jean Negulesco and starring John Garfield and Micheline Presle. It is based on the 1923 short story &quot;My Old Man&quot;, by Ernest Hemingway, about a jockey being threatened by a mobster after winning a race he had agreed to throw.

The Hemingway story was later adapted for a 1979 CBS television film, &quot;My Old Man&quot;, starring Kristy McNichol, Warren Oates, and Eileen Brennan.

==Plot==
Accused of throwing races back home, American jockey Danny Arnold now rides horses in Italy, where a gangster named Bork insists he deliberately lose a race. Dan double-crosses him, then avoids Bork&#x27;s thugs, taking young son Joe with him to Paris.

Intending to look up an old friend, Dan learns from cafe owner Paule Manet that the friend was murdered by criminals due to unpaid debts. British jockey George Gardner is able to find Dan gainful employment at the racetrack, while Joe persuades his dad that a new horse of theirs called Gilford would make a fine steeplechase racer. Dan disappoints his son by winning money on a fixed race that involved George.

Bork and his henchmen turn up. They threaten to kill Dan if he doesn&#x27;t lose the next steeplechase race. They have their own jockey in the race to make sure things go their way, but Dan defies them, with George&#x27;s help. He wins the race, but when another horse runs into Gilford at the finish line, Dan is thrown off and killed.

<text>Kasdi Merbah (, 16 April 1938 – 21 August 1993), whose real name is Abdallah Khalef, was an Algerian politician who served as Head of Government between 5 November 1988 and 9 September 1989 when he was a member of the National Liberation Front. He was assassinated on August 21, 1993.

==Biography==
Kasdi Merbah was born on the 16th of April 1938 in the province of Beni Yenni. During the 1970s and early 1980s, he was the head of the Sécurité Militaire, the Algerian state intelligence service. Before the 1988 October Riots he had served as Minister of Agriculture and then Minister of Public Health, and the following month he was appointed prime minister. However, during his tenure he had an increasingly fractious relationship with President Chadli Bendjedid, and was removed from office in September 1989.

Public criticism of Bendjedid led to him becoming isolated within the FLN, and in October 1990 he left the party to form the Algerian Movement for Justice and Development, known by its acronym &quot;MAJD&quot;, meaning &quot;glory&quot; in Arabic. However, the party failed to win a seat in the 1991 parliamentary elections, the results of which were annulled after a military coup. Merbah appeared to be a very moderate politician and tried (secretly and overtly) to help in finding a solution for the Algerian Civil War that followed the coup. A great number of analysts attribute his assassination to his past in the security services and the many state secrets he possessed, beside the apparent moderate posture he had adopted with regard to dealing with the Islamist movements, particularly the FIS who went for the armed option.

On August 21, 1993, Kasdi was assassinated in Bordj El Bahri along with his younger son Hakim, his brother Abdelaziz, his driver Hachemi Ait Mekidèche, as well as his bodyguard Abdelaziz Nasri. They were attacked with automatic pistol fire by a band of five men while driving in Alger-Plage, a coastal resort 12 miles east of the capital, police said. The murder was condemned by agents of the FIS in Europe who claimed it was carried out by the Algerian intelligence service, while the responsibility was claimed by the GIA.

<doc id="792474" wikidata="Q4683195" url="?curid=792474" title="Adjustable Ranging Telescope">
<text>The Adjustable Ranging Telescope (ART) is a weapons sighting system typically used as a military rifle scope which was initially designed for service in the Vietnam War. It was developed and patented by James M. Leatherwood. It combines a range-finding scale inside of a telescopic sight with an adjustable cam integrated into the scope&#x27;s mount. This raises or lowers the rear of the outer sight to compensate for the ballistic rise or fall of the projectile. The cam is preset for a specific cartridge, i.e., the 7.62 mm NATO round. Since the range cam is locked to the magnification ring, it automatically sets the range and adjusts for the ballistic drop of the shot. This then allows the shooter to place the optic&#x27;s aiming point directly on the target.

During the Vietnam War, Lieutenant Leatherwood, who already had the patents for his ART system, entered the Army and began working with U.S. Army Ordnance specialists. The combination of the Leatherwood Adjustable Ranging Telescope (ART) with M14 National Match rifles went on to create the M21 Sniper Rifle.

<doc id="792480" wikidata="Q1192158" url="?curid=792480" title="Yasunori Matsumoto">
<text>is a Japanese actor and voice actor affiliated with Sigma Seven. Some of Matsumoto&#x27;s most notable roles are Wataru Akiyama in &quot;Initial D&quot;, Jean Havoc in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, Magnum Ace in &quot;Shippū! Iron Leaguer&quot;, Gourry Gabriev in &quot;Slayers&quot; and Ryo Hibiki in &quot;Sonic Soldier Borgman&quot;. His wife was voice actress Junko Sakuma, who died in March 2011.

==Career==
Matsumoto graduated from the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Law, Chuo University after graduating from Yakuendai High School. He used to be a member of Production Baobab. He was also the vice-chairman of Sugoroku, a theater company led by Kenichi Ogata, and became the chairperson after Ogata retired. He later left the company in 2016.

When Matsumoto was a student, he was the captain of a cycle racing club, and has even participated in the National Athletic Meet. However, he left the club due to a back injury. Originally a science fiction enthusiast, he was a science major until he was in high school. However, after watching a political program on TV at some point, he became interested in the world&#x27;s developments and entered the Department of Political Science in the Faculty of Law at Chuo University with the intention of becoming a bureaucrat. Although he hoped to pursue a career related to politics, he was faced with a harsh reality and spent his school days lost in his career path.

In the midst of all this, Matsumoto was impressed by the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and since all of his friends at the boarding house were film buffs, he decided to become a film production staff member. However, when he graduated from university, the Japanese film industry was in a state of downsizing and there were not many good opportunities for staff, and unlike today, there were few production companies, so the road to film production was difficult. He decided to join a theatrical troupe, hoping to become staff after getting into the world of actors first. When he was about to graduate, a friend of his introduced him to Theater Company Garakuta Kōbō (now Sugoroku), which was recruiting, and he entered the affiliated training school as a fourth-year student.

Although he did not have much experience in voice work, when he went to observe a studio that was recording the voice actors&#x27; dubbing, he was surprised to see how all the cast members at the scene watched the footage only once on the spot and recorded it immediately, although nowadays actors receive rehearsal materials in advance. When he borrowed the script and watched the performance, his eyes could not keep up with the speed of the performers&#x27; work, and he couldn&#x27;t follow where they were at. After that, he had several auditions for voice work, but had no idea what work he was auditioning for. In the midst of that, he was told to read a manuscript according to the feeling of an artwork he was shown, and when he did, he passed his first audition. That was to be his debut work, the anime TV series &quot;Manga Nihon Keizai Nyūmon&quot;.

<text>Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening is a surrealist painting by Salvador Dalí, from 1944. A shorter alternate title for the painting is Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee. The woman in the painting, dreaming, is believed to represent his wife, Gala, a regular presence in his work. The painting is currently in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, in Madrid.

==Description==
It is an oil painting on wood. In this &quot;hand-painted dream photograph&quot;, as Dalí generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps Port Lligat, amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dalí depicts two suspended droplets of water and a pomegranate, a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection. Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.

In the upper left of the painting what seems to be a yelloweye rockfish bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a pouncing tiger that then spews out another pouncing tiger about to attack Gala and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting her in the arm. Above them is Dalí&#x27;s first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony&quot;. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Elephant and Obelisk&quot; in Rome&#x27;s Piazza Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

==Themes and symbolism==

The bayonet, as a symbol of the stinging bee, may represent the woman&#x27;s abrupt awakening from her otherwise peaceful dream. This is an example of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s influence on surrealist art and Dalí&#x27;s attempts to explore the world of dreams in a dreamscape.

The elephant is a distorted version of the Piazza della Minerva sculpture &quot;Elephant and Obelisk&quot; by Gian Lorenzo Bernini facing the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. The smaller pomegranate floating between two droplets of water may symbolize Venus, especially because of the heart-shaped shadow it casts. It may also be used as a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection. This female symbolism may contrast with the phallic symbolism of the threatening creatures.

It has also been suggested that the painting is &quot;a surrealist interpretation of the Theory of Evolution.&quot;

In 1962, Dalí said this painting was intended &quot;to express for the first time in images Freud&#x27;s discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the guillotine blade falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala.&quot; The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by Alfred Maury in &quot;Le sommeil et les rêves&quot; (&quot;Sleep and Dreams&quot;) and related by Freud in his 1899 book &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;.

<text>The Amazonian motmot (Momotus momota) is a colorful near-passerine bird in the family Momotidae. It is found in the Amazon lowlands and low Andean foothills from eastern Venezuela to eastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Amazonian motmot and the blue-capped (&quot;Momotus coeruleiceps&quot;), whooping (&quot;M. subrufrescens&quot;), Trinidad (&quot;M. bahamensis&quot;), Lesson&#x27;s (&quot;M. lessonii&quot;), and Andean motmots (&quot;M. aequatorialis&quot;) were all at one time considered conspecific. The Amazonian motmot has nine recognized subspecies; they are listed in the &quot;Distribution and habitat&quot; section below.

==Description==

The Amazonian motmot&#x27;s plumage varies among the subspecies. The bodies of all are shades of green. All have a long tail that has extended feathers with racquet tips that are green or black. Most have a black eyemask, though their size and shape differ. The central crown is black and surrounded or partially bordered by a blue band. The nominate subspecies has a chestnut nape. &quot;Momotus momota ignobilis&quot; and &quot;M. m. cametensis&quot; have more extensive chestnut on the neck and face.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Amazonian motmot is widely distributed in South America east of the Andes. Nine subspecies are recognized:

*&quot;Momotus momota momota&quot; — eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and northern Brazil
*&quot;M. m. microstephanus&quot; — southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, and northwestern Brazil
*&quot;M. m. ignobilis&quot; — eastern Peru and western Brazil
*&quot;M. m. nattereri&quot; — northeastern Bolivia
*&quot;M. m. simplex&quot; — western to west central Brazil south of the Amazon
*&quot;M. m. cametensis&quot; — north central Brazil
*&quot;M. m. parensis&quot; — northeastern Brazil
*&quot;M. m. marcgravianus&quot; — eastern Brazil
*&quot;M. m. pilcomajensis&quot; — southern Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northwestern Argentina

Throughout its range the Amazonian motmot inhabits the interior and edges of humid lowland forest. It is found up to in Venezuela, to in Ecuador, and to in Peru.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

The Amazonian motmot is omnivorous. It has been documented eating insects and other arthropods, small mammals and reptiles, and fruit.

===Breeding===

Like most Coraciiformes, the Amazonian motmot nests in long tunnels in earth banks. Very little else is known about its breeding phenology.

===Vocalization===

The Amazonian motmot&#x27;s song has been described as &quot;a fast, hollow &quot;hoo-do&quot;&quot; and &quot;a bubbling &quot;whOOP-oo&quot;&quot;. It also makes &quot;a gruff &quot;kak&quot;&quot;, sometimes in a series.

<doc id="792524" wikidata="Q831530" url="?curid=792524" title="Rosacea">
<text>Rosacea is a long-term skin condition that typically affects the face. It results in redness, pimples, swelling, and small and superficial dilated blood vessels. Often, the nose, cheeks, forehead, and chin are most involved. A red, enlarged nose may occur in severe disease, a condition known as rhinophyma.
The cause of rosacea is unknown. Risk factors are believed to include a family history of the condition. Factors that may potentially worsen the condition include heat, exercise, sunlight, cold, spicy food, alcohol, menopause, psychological stress, or steroid cream on the face. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.
While not curable, treatment usually improves symptoms. Treatment is typically with metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, or tetracycline. When the eyes are affected, azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.
Rosacea affects between 1% and 10% of people. Those affected are most often 30 to 50 years old and female. Fair-skinned people seem to be more commonly affected. The condition was described in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in the 1300s, and possibly as early as the 200s BC by Theocritus.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Rosacea typically begins with reddening (flushing) of the skin in symmetrical patches near the center of the face. Common signs can depend on age and sex: flushing and red swollen patches are common in the young, small and visible dilated blood vessels in older individuals, and swelling of the nose is common in men. Other signs include lumps on the skin (papules or pustules) and swelling of the face. Many people experience stinging or burning pain and rarely itching.

Skin problems tend to be aggravated by particular trigger factors, that differ for different people. Common triggers are ultraviolet light, heat, cold, or certain foods or beverages.

=== Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea ===

Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (also known as &quot;vascular rosacea&quot;) is characterized by prominent history of prolonged (over 10 minutes) flushing reaction to various stimuli, such as emotional stress, hot drinks, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, cold or hot weather, or hot baths and showers.

=== Glandular rosacea ===

In glandular rosacea, men with thick sebaceous skin predominate, a disease in which the papules are edematous, and the pustules are often 0.5 to 1.0 cm in size, with nodulocystic lesions often present.

== Cause ==

The exact cause of rosacea is unknown. Triggers that cause episodes of flushing and blushing play a part in its development. Exposure to temperature extremes, strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, cold wind, and moving to a warm or hot environment from a cold one, such as heated shops and offices during the winter, can each cause the face to become flushed. Certain foods and drinks can also trigger flushing, such as alcohol, foods and beverages containing caffeine (especially hot tea and coffee), foods high in histamines, and spicy foods.

Medications and topical irritants have also been known to trigger rosacea flares. Some acne and wrinkle treatments reported to cause rosacea include microdermabrasion and chemical peels, as well as high dosages of isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and tretinoin.

Steroid-induced rosacea is caused by the use of topical steroids. These steroids are often prescribed for seborrheic dermatitis. Dosage should be slowly decreased and not immediately stopped to avoid a flare-up.

=== Cathelicidins ===

In 2007, Richard Gallo and colleagues noticed that patients with rosacea had high levels of cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide, and elevated levels of stratum corneum tryptic enzymes (SCTEs). Antibiotics have been used in the past to treat rosacea, but they may only work because they inhibit some SCTEs.

=== Demodex folliculitis and &quot;Demodex&quot; mites ===

Studies of rosacea and &quot;Demodex&quot; mites have revealed that some people with rosacea have increased numbers of the mite, especially those with steroid-induced rosacea. Demodex folliculitis (demodicidosis, also known as &quot;mange&quot; in animals) is a condition that may have a &quot;rosacea-like&quot; appearance.

A 2007, National Rosacea Society-funded study demonstrated that &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; mites may be a cause or exacerbating factor in rosacea. The researchers identified &quot;Bacillus oleronius&quot; as a distinct bacterium associated with &quot;Demodex&quot; mites. When analyzing blood samples using a peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation assay, they discovered that &quot;B. oleronius&quot; stimulated an immune system response in 79 percent of 22 patients with subtype 2 (papulopustular) rosacea, compared with only 29% of 17 subjects without the disorder. They concluded, &quot;The immune response results in inflammation, as evident in the papules (bumps) and pustules (pimples) of subtype 2 rosacea. This suggests that the &quot;B. oleronius&quot; bacteria found in the mites could be responsible for the inflammation associated with the condition.&quot;

=== Intestinal bacteria ===

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) was demonstrated to have greater prevalence in rosacea patients and treating it with locally acting antibiotics led to rosacea lesion improvement in two studies. Conversely in rosacea patients who were SIBO negative, antibiotic therapy had no effect. The effectiveness of treating SIBO in rosacea patients may suggest that gut bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of rosacea lesions.

== Diagnosis ==

Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never formally diagnosed or treated. No test for rosacea is known. In many cases, simple visual inspection by a trained health-care professional is sufficient for diagnosis. In other cases, particularly when pimples or redness on less-common parts of the face is present, a trial of common treatments is useful for confirming a suspected diagnosis. The disorder can be confused or co-exist with acne vulgaris or seborrheic dermatitis. The presence of a rash on the scalp or ears suggests a different or co-existing diagnosis because rosacea is primarily a facial diagnosis, although it may occasionally appear in these other areas.

=== Classification ===

Four rosacea subtypes exist, and a patient may have more than one subtype:

# Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea exhibits permanent redness (erythema) with a tendency to flush and blush easily. Also small, widened blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) and possibly intense burning, stinging, and itching are common. People with this type often have sensitive skin. Skin can also become very dry and flaky. In addition to the face, signs can also appear on the ears, neck, chest, upper back, and scalp.
# Papulopustular rosacea presents with some permanent redness with red bumps (papules); some pus-filled pustules can last 1–4 days or longer. This subtype is often confused with acne.
# Phymatous rosacea is most commonly associated with rhinophyma, an enlargement of the nose. Signs include thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. Phymatous rosacea can also affect the chin (gnathophyma), forehead (metophyma), cheeks, eyelids (blepharophyma), and ears (otophyma). Telangiectasias may be present.
# In ocular rosacea, affected eyes and eyelids may appear red due to telangiectasias and inflammation, and may feel dry, irritated, or gritty. Other symptoms include foreign-body sensations, itching, burning, stinging, and sensitivity to light. Eyes can become more susceptible to infection. About half of the people with subtypes 1–3 also have eye symptoms. Keratitis is a rare complication which is characterized by blurry vision and vision loss as the cornea is affected.

=== Variants ===

Variants of rosacea include:
* Pyoderma faciale, also known as rosacea fulminans, is a conglobate, nodular disease that arises abruptly on the face.
* Rosacea conglobata is a severe rosacea that can mimic acne conglobata, with hemorrhagic nodular abscesses and indurated plaques.
* Phymatous rosacea is a cutaneous condition characterized by overgrowth of sebaceous glands. &quot;Phyma&quot; is Greek for swelling, mass, or bulb, and these can occur on the face and ears.

== Treatment==
The type of rosacea that a person has will indicate the choice of treatment. Mild cases are often not treated at all, or are simply covered up with normal cosmetics.

Therapy for the treatment of rosacea is not curative, and is best measured in terms of reduction in the amount of facial redness and inflammatory lesions, a decrease in the number, duration, and intensity of flares, and concomitant symptoms of itching, burning, and tenderness. The two primary modalities of rosacea treatment are topical and oral antibiotic agents. Laser therapy has also been classified as a form of treatment. While medications often produce a temporary remission of redness within a few weeks, the redness typically returns shortly after treatment is suspended. Long-term treatment, usually 1–2 years, may result in permanent control of the condition for some patients. Lifelong treatment is often necessary, although some cases resolve after a while and go into a permanent remission. Other cases, if left untreated, worsen over time. Some people have also reported better results after changing diet. This is not confirmed by medical studies, even though some studies relate the histamine production to outbreak of rosacea.

=== Behavior ===
Certain behavioral changes may improve the symptoms of rosacea or help to prevent exacerbations. Keeping a symptoms diary to document potential symptom triggers and avoiding those triggers is recommended. Common exacerbating triggers include ultraviolet light and irritant cosmetics, therefore it is recommended that those with rosacea wear sunscreen (with a sun factor protection (SPF) of 30 or greater) and avoid cosmetics. If using cosmetics or makeup is desired, then oil free foundation and concealer should be used. Skin astringents, products that can dry the skin and impair the skin barrier, including products with alcohol, menthol, peppermint, camphor, or eucalyptus oil, should generally be avoided. People should avoid using exfoliating skin scrubs, cosmetics or soaps containing sodium laureth sulfate, or waterproof makeup to the affected area as these products can compromise the skin barrier protection and be difficult to remove. Using soap-free cleansers and non-oily moisturizers are preferred if used on the affected area. Many skin care products have been specifically formulated for those with sensitive skin or for those with conditions such as rosacea. Ocular rosacea may be treated with daily gentle eyelid washing using warm water, and artificial tears to lubricate the eye.

Managing pre-trigger events such as prolonged exposure to cool environments can directly influence warm-room flushing.

=== Medications ===
Medications with good evidence include topical metronidazole, ivermectin and azelaic acid. Good evidence medications taken by mouth include brimonidine, and doxycycline and isotretinoin. Lesser evidence supports tetracycline by mouth. Isotretinoin and tetracycline antibiotics, which may be used in more severe cases of inflammatory rosacea, are absolutely contraindicated in women who are pregnant, may become pregnant or lactating as they are highly teratogenic (associated with birth defects). Contraception is required for women of child-bearing age who are using these medications.

Metronidazole is thought to act through anti-inflammatory mechanisms, while azelaic acid is thought to decrease cathelicidin production. Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class such as doxycycline, minocycline, and oxytetracycline are also commonly used and thought to reduce papulopustular lesions through anti-inflammatory actions rather than through their antibacterial capabilities.

Topical minocycline applied as a foam is a newer treatment option for rosacea that the FDA has approved. Minocycline shows a targeted approach for managing inflammatory lesions of rosacea while minimizing systemic side effects commonly associated with oral antibiotic use. It is available in foam formulation and is applied to the affected areas once daily. Minocycline belongs to the tetracycline family of antibiotics and exhibits antimicrobial properties and anti-inflammatory activity, similar to other members of this class, such as doxycycline. Topical minocycline reduces inflammatory lesions associated with rosacea; however, rare adverse events such as folliculitis have been reported.

Topical metronidazole is a commonly used treatment for rosacea; it is available in various formulations such as creams, gels, or lotions and applied to clean, dry skin once or twice daily. Topical metronidazole has been shown to effectively reduce inflammatory lesions and perilesional erythema associated with rosacea by inhibiting both microbial growth and pro-inflammatory mediators generated by neutrophils. Benefits of topical metronidazole include its effectiveness in reducing symptoms, extensive clinical experience supporting its use, and generally good tolerability with minimal systemic side effects; still, some patients may experience mild local irritation upon initial use, and it may have limited impact on persistent facial redness (erythema).

Topical azelaic acid is available in gel or cream formulations; it exerts its effects by reducing inflammation through its activity on the cathelicidin pathway, which is upregulated in rosacea-affected skin; it also reduces inflammatory lesions and improves overall symptoms of rosacea; it has been well-studied and shown to be effective in clinical trials; still, some patients may experience mild local irritation during the first few weeks of use.

Using alpha-hydroxy acid peels may help relieve redness caused by irritation, and reduce papules and pustules associated with rosacea.

Oral Beta-blockers are often used for those with flushing due to rosacea. These include nadolol, propranolol or carvedilol. The possible adverse reactions of the oral beta-blockers include low blood pressure, low heart rate or dizziness. The oral α-2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine can also be used for flushing symptoms. The flushing and blushing that typically accompany rosacea may also be treated with the topical application of alpha agonists such as brimonidine which has vasoconstrictor activity and achieves maximal symptom improvement 3–6 hours after application, other topicals used for flushing or erythema include oxymetazoline or xylometazoline.

Topical ivermectin is a treatment option for rosacea that targets Demodex mites, which are associated with inflammation in the skin of patients with rosacea; the cream is applied once daily to clean, dry skin. Topical ivermectin has been shown to reduce Demodex mite density and improve cutaneous inflammatory markers in clinical studies; overall, it decreases Demodex mite density and improves the symptoms of inflammation associated with rosacea; however, some patients may experience transient burning or itching upon application. Topical ivermectin offers a targeted approach for managing rosacea by addressing the role of Demodex mites in the disease process. A review found that ivermectin was more effective than alternatives for treatment of papulopustular acne rosacea. An ivermectin cream has been approved by the FDA, as well as in Europe, for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is based upon the hypothesis that parasitic mites of the genus &quot;Demodex&quot; play a role in rosacea. In a clinical study, ivermectin reduced lesions by 83% over 4 months, as compared to 74% under a metronidazole standard therapy. Quassia amara extract at 4% demonstrated to have clinical efficacy for rosacea. When compared to metronidazole 0.75% as usual care in a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, Quassia amara extract at 4% demonstrated earlier onset of action, including improvement in telangiectasia, flushing, and papules. Quassia amara showed a sustained reduction of symptoms at 42 days of treatment.

Cyclosporin eye drops have been shown to reduce symptoms in those with ocular rosacea. Cyclosporin should not be used in those with an active ocular infection. Other options include topical metronidazole cream or topical fusidic acid applied to the eyelids, or oral doxycycline in more severe cases of ocular rosacea. If papules and pustules persist, then sometimes isotretinoin can be prescribed.

Systemic doxycycline modified-release capsules are commonly used for the treatment of rosacea. The capsules are taken orally once daily, usually in a low dose, to achieve anti-inflammatory effects. Doxycycline acts by inhibiting inflammation and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species associated with rosacea symptoms. The benefits of systemic doxycycline include its effectiveness in reducing inflammatory lesions, improving erythema, and controlling symptoms related to ocular involvement in rosacea patients; it is also well-tolerated at lower doses compared to traditional higher-dose regimens used for other indications. However, potential cons include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea or abdominal pain, photosensitivity reactions that require sun protection measures during treatment, and rare instances of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or bacterial resistance development with long-term use.

Encapsulated benzoyl peroxide (E-BPO) cream, a newly FDA-approved topical agent for inflammatory lesions of rosacea, utilizes porous silica microcapsule technology to slow the absorption of benzoyl peroxide and diminish potential irritation.

=== Laser ===

Evidence for the use of laser and intense pulsed-light therapy in rosacea is poor.

== Outcomes ==
The highly visible nature of rosacea symptoms are often psychologically challenging for those affected. People with rosacea can experience issues with self-esteem, socializing, and changes to their thoughts, feelings, and coping mechanisms.

== Epidemiology ==

Rosacea affects around 5% of people worldwide. Incidence varies by ethnicity, and is particularly prevalent in those of Celtic heritage. Men and women are equally likely to develop rosacea.

<text>Quantum Effect Devices, Inc. (QED), was a microprocessor design company incorporated in 1991 as Quantum Effect Design. It was based in Palo Alto, California.

==History==

The three founders, Tom Riordan, Earl Killian and Ray Kunita, were senior managers at MIPS Computer Systems Inc. They left MIPS at a time when the company was having a difficult time selling entire computer systems (MIPS Magnum) instead of concentrating on building microprocessor chips which was MIPS&#x27; original mission. Soon after, SGI purchased MIPS. IDT was a major funder and customer for the initial QED design.

===Business===
The original product plan for QED was to build a MIPS microprocessor for a laptop computer. This was during the ACE initiative from Microsoft to support multiple RISC architectures for their new Windows NT operating system. System companies like DeskStation Technology and board companies like ShaBLAMM! Computer were building products in the hope that RISC-based personal computers would become mainstream. While that market never materialized, the first product, the R4600 &quot;Orion&quot; microprocessor, proved to be successful in several embedded markets such as networking routers and arcade games. Subsequent projects were designed for companies such as Toshiba and IDT (R4700), IDT &amp; NKK (R4650), SGI and NEC (R5000).

The PowerPC 603q was a PowerPC microprocessor designed for Motorola, meant for Apple Computer&#x27;s home PC and game machine designs. Neither of these designs were productized, so the PowerPC 603q never reached full production.

Several years later, in an attempt to increase product revenue, the company transformed itself to a product company selling its own line of MIPS microprocessors. At that time, the company changed its name to Quantum Effect Devices. After successful products introductions like the RM5200 and the RM7000, under its own &quot;RISCMark&quot; label, the company had its IPO on 1 February 2000. The initial stock price of $16 jumped to $56.50 on the first day of trading. The company was acquired by PMC-Sierra in October 2000; at the time, Quantum Effect Devices was valued in a stock swap worth $2.3 billion according to one estimate. The company became the Microprocessor Products Division of PMC. The acquisition was done by stock exchange and was valued at $2.3 billion. The team completed the RM9x00 product line while at PMC, but that product line was not successful in the marketplace. Most of the microprocessor core development team derived from QED was laid off as a group by PMC-Sierra in June 2005; the last few were laid off in January 2006.

The company name was attributed to Tom Riordan. He believed that the company would survive to the age when semiconductor geometry dimensions would become so small that quantum effects would dominate circuit behavior.

=== Devices ===
The first QED microprocessor was the R4600. The founders of QED, who were previously involved with the R4000, felt that the large device was too complicated and that a simpler implementation would give a better price/performance ratio. For that reason, the R4600 is a re-implementation of the 5-stage Classic RISC pipeline with large (for the time) caches. For a while, this small and low cost device was one of the highest performance microprocessors on the market. While the initial target market of a MIPS laptop computer never materialized, this device found success in several markets. It was the first RISC processor used within a Cisco Systems network router. It was used in several Atari/Midway arcade games such as the first two Killer Instinct games. The R4600 was licensed by IDT and Toshiba who manufactured and sold the devices.

The R4700 was targeted at SGI, who wanted a little more floating point performance. The R4700 improved on the repeat rate of floating point multiply instructions. This device was used inside the SGI Indy low-end workstation. The R4700 was licensed by IDT and Toshiba who manufactured and sold the devices.

The R4650 was commissioned by NKK, who desired a cheaper implementation for a video console game machine. The R4650 achieved a smaller die area by cutting the caches in half, only implementing single precision floating-point. This device was the first QED device that implemented the multiply–accumulate instructions, which enabled software functions such as softmodem. This device was used in the original Microsoft WebTV device. The R4650 was licensed by IDT and NKK who manufactured and sold the devices. The R4640 was the same chip but with the system bus restricted to 32-bits instead of 64-bits.

The R5000 was commissioned by SGI. This device doubled the instruction and data caches to 32 KB. It implemented a high-performance, fully pipelined floating point unit with multiply–accumulate capability and a SRT divider. The device had a limited implementation of superscalar instruction issue in which one integer instruction and one floating-point instruction could be issued in one cycle. This device was used in the SGI O2 and SGI Indy low-end workstations. The design was owned by SGI, which licensed the design to IDT and NEC and eventually to Toshiba.

The PowerPC 603q was commissioned by Motorola and the target market was Apple Computer&#x27;s low-cost accounts including a home computer for students and a home video console game named &quot;Pippen&quot;. The 603q was basically the R4600 pipeline re-targeted for the PowerPC instruction set. Since the PowerPC 603 was then the most power-efficient chip from the AIM alliance, the name of this device was chosen to reflect its low-cost and low-power characteristics. Once those Apple projects were cancelled, Motorola stopped the development of the 603q even though QED had received first silicon samples and they were functional.

The RM52XX series was the first product line sold directly by QED. The first of the series was a cost-reduced version of the R5000 with smaller caches and a different pin-out. The earlier RM52X0 devices had only 16 KB caches while the later RM52X1 devices had 32 KB caches. The RM523X devices had 32-bit system buses while RM526X had 64-bit system buses. This product line was very successful in the laser printer market, winning many accounts at printer companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, Ricoh, Samsung.

The RM70XX series was the second product line sold directly by QED. It implemented a large 256 KB on-chip level 2 cache. The RM7000 was one of the first microprocessors to do so, especially within the embedded microprocessor market segment. It also implemented symmetric superscalar instruction issue with two integer execution units. The RM7061 device was a pin-compatible upgrade for the RM526X series. This product line was a very successful follow-on to the RM52XX products.

The RM9x00 family was the first SOC implemented by QED. The Apollo microprocessor core that was part of the RM9x00 had its pipeline lengthened to 7 stages to enable higher operating frequencies. Dynamic branch prediction was added to ameliorate the longer branch latencies. Within the RM9x00, two Apollo cores were used to implement a dual-core device. These processor cores successfully achieved their operating frequency target of 1 GHz. The SOC system interconnect was an in-house design with centralized storage for the transactions flowing through the SOC. Peripherals included a DDR memory controller, a SysAD bus controller, a boot bus controller, a DMA controller and a Hypertransport controller. A second generation device added a Gigabit Ethernet controller, a PCI controller and cache coherency. This product family was not successful due to being late to the market. The company was financially conservative during the time leading up to and after the company&#x27;s initial public offering and would not fully staff the SOC project. One of the reasons for selling the company to PMC-Sierra was to fund these SOC projects. By that time, competitors like SiByte had already entered the market with equivalent devices.

<text>Julia Verlyn LaMarsh (December 20, 1924 – October 27, 1980) was a Canadian politician, lawyer, author and broadcaster. In 1963, she became the second woman to serve as a federal Cabinet minister. Under Prime Minister Lester Pearson&#x27;s minority governments of the middle and late 1960s, she helped push through the legislation that created the Canada Pension Plan and Medicare. As Secretary of State, she was in charge of Canada&#x27;s Centennial celebrations in 1967. After leaving politics in 1968, she wrote three books, and had her own radio show on CBC Radio. She was stricken with pancreatic cancer in 1979 and was given the Order of Canada at her hospital bed. She died a few days short of the 20th anniversary of her first political election victory, in 1980.

== Early life ==

LaMarsh was born December 20, 1924, in Chatham, Ontario. Of French and English descent, she was raised in Niagara Falls. Although she trained as a teacher, she never taught school. In high school, she was a member of Alpha Chapter, Theta Kappa Sigma Sorority in Niagara Falls. During World War II, she enlisted in the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps, travelled the country from 1943 to 1946, and attained the rank of sergeant. LaMarsh worked with the Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers in Halifax and then, after studying Japanese in Vancouver, served as a Japanese translator in Intelligence with Japanese-Canadian soldiers.

After the war, she attended the University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria College and Osgoode Hall, where she was trained as a lawyer, graduating in 1950. She was called to the Bar of Ontario, and joined her father&#x27;s law practice in Niagara Falls.

==Political career==
After unsuccessful forays into Ontario provincial politics, LaMarsh was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1960 by-election. Sitting as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Niagara Falls, she joined the Canadian Cabinet after the Liberals defeated the Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker in the 1963 election. Serving under Prime Minister Lester Pearson, she was the second female federal cabinet minister in Canadian history, and the first to serve in a Liberal cabinet. LaMarsh served as Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of Amateur Sport from 1963 to 1965, and as Secretary of State for Canada from 1965 to 1968.

Her period as Minister of National Health and Welfare coincided with the introduction of the Canada Pension Plan and the drafting of what was to become Canada&#x27;s Medicare system. Besides shepherding the Medicare bill through parliament, she also became the first major western-world government official to oppose tobacco smoking publicly. On June 17, 1963, she rose to speak on the floor of the House of Commons and declared: &quot;There is scientific evidence that cigarette smoking is a contributory cause of lung cancer and that it may also be associated with chronic bronchitis and coronary heart disease.&quot; As Secretary of State, she presided over the Canadian Centennial celebrations in 1967, presented the Broadcasting Act of 1968 to Parliament, and served on the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.

In the 1968 Liberal leadership convention to choose a successor to Pearson, she supported Paul Hellyer. When it became clear after the first round of voting that Hellyer could not win, she urged him to drop off the ballot and throw his support to another candidate in order to stop Pierre Trudeau. Her words, uttered on the floor of the convention hall: &quot;Paul, you&#x27;ve got to go to [Robert] Winters. Don&#x27;t let that bastard win it, Paul – he isn&#x27;t even a Liberal&quot; were, unbeknownst to her, broadcast live over CBC Television. She retired from politics after Trudeau won the party&#x27;s leadership.

==Post-political career==
After politics, she returned to her work as a lawyer. She often took on civil rights cases, including the defense of the Brunswick Four in a prominent LGBT rights case in 1974.

She published her political autobiography, entitled &quot;Memoirs of a Bird in a Gilded Cage&quot;, in 1969, and the book sold very well. LaMarsh worked as a broadcaster including a part-time job with CBC Radio, hosting &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot; in 1974. From fall 1975 to spring 1976, she hosted her own show called &quot;Judy&quot;. It was broadcast weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to noon, nationally.

In April 1975, Ontario Premier William Davis chose her to head the Ontario government&#x27;s Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry. It spent two years coming up with 68 recommendations, many highly controversial ones like an omnibus government agency controlling all television content, and newspapers to be governed by a national council on ethics, that would police the industry for violations. Civil liberty groups criticized the media recommendations as violations on free speech and freedom of the press grounds.

==Later life and death==
In 1979, she decided to go back into law, and opened a family law practice. In December 1979, LaMarsh was rushed to Sunnybrook Medical Centre where she was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. While receiving treatment for her cancer at Toronto&#x27;s Princess Margaret Hospital, Governor General Edward Schreyer invested her as an Officer of the Order of Canada, at her hospital bed on July 22, 1980. A few months later, just days away from the 20th anniversary of her first federal political victory, she died on October 27, 1980, aged 55.

Her funeral was held in Niagara Falls on October 29, 1980. She had six female pallbearers including: Edith Druggan and Florence Rosberg, of Niagara Falls, broadcaster Barbara Frum, British Columbia Judge Nancy Morrison, lawyer Pamela Verill Walker, and Doris Anderson, president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. It was a short service, attended by 300 friends and dignitaries including Ontario&#x27;s premier William Davis, former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor Pauline McGibbon, and several federal politicians including the man she backed for federal Liberal leader in 1968, Paul Hellyer. She was laid to rest next to her parents, at a graveyard that bordered the historic Canadian battleground, Lundy&#x27;s Lane.

<text>Thievery Corporation is an American electronic music duo consisting of Rob Garza and Eric Hilton. Their musical style mixes elements of dub, acid jazz, reggae, Indian classical, Middle Eastern music, hip hop, electronica, and Brazilian music, including bossa nova.

== History ==
Thievery Corporation was formed in the summer of 1995 at Washington D.C.&#x27;s Eighteenth Street Lounge. Rob Garza and Lounge co-owner Eric Hilton were drawn together over their mutual love of club life, as well as dub, bossa nova, ReggeEDM, and jazz records. They decided to see what would come of mixing all these in a recording studio, and from this, in 1996 the duo started their Eighteenth Street Lounge Music record label.

The duo drew attention with their first two 12-inch offerings, &quot;Shaolin Satellite&quot; and &quot;2001: a Spliff Odyssey&quot;, and with their 1996 debut LP, &quot;Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi&quot;.

In 2001, they released &quot;Sounds From The Verve Hi-Fi&quot;, a &quot;best of&quot; compilation of 1960s–1970s material of Verve Records that includes Jazz, Bossa Nova and Latin Jazz works from artists like Cal Tjader, Wes Montgomery, Sérgio Mendes &amp; Brasil &#x27;66, Luiz Bonfá, among others. 

In 2002 they released &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; on their ESL label. This fifteen-track album is similar in sound and timbre to their earlier 2000 release, &quot;The Mirror Conspiracy&quot;, and features performances by vocalists Emilíana Torrini, Pam Bricker, and Loulou. 

In 2004, they released &quot;The Cosmic Game&quot;, which has a darker, more psychedelic sound than &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;. The album also featured more high-profile guest singers on it, including Perry Farrell, David Byrne, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.

In 2006, the group released &quot;Versions&quot;, a selection of remixes by Thievery Corporation for other artists. They toured around the United States, playing at Lollapalooza. The tour was photographed by Rob Myers, Thievery Corporation&#x27;s sitar and guitar player, in the Blurb photo book &quot;Thievery Corporation 2006&quot;. In 2006, the band also recorded &quot;Sol Tapado&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin Redux&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. As well, in the 2006 release of &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour&quot; for Xbox, their music was featured as the soundtrack to the game. Also in 2006, Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, joined and toured with Thievery Corporation and continues to tour with them today.

The group released their fifth studio album, &quot;Radio Retaliation&quot;, on September 23, 2008. It was nominated for the Grammy for best recording package. Thievery Corporation&#x27;s tour started out with five consecutive sold-out shows at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC.

They were the opening act on August 1, 2009, for Paul McCartney at FedExField in Landover, Maryland.

On July 27, 2010, &quot;Babylon Central&quot;, the cinematic directorial debut of founding member Eric Hilton, was released. Set (and shot) in Washington, D.C., the film follows tripwire events in the interconnected lives of its characters, each influencing power brokers&#x27; schemes to manipulate international currencies.

In June 2011, Thievery Corporation released their sixth album, &quot;Culture of Fear,&quot; which also featured the vocal stylings of Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, on the tracks: &quot;Overstand&quot; and &quot;False Flag Dub.&quot;

In January 2012, Thievery Corporation launched a remixes contest in conjunction with Dubspot. The same year, Eric Hilton from Thievery Corporation produced the debut album, &quot;Archives&quot;, for Washington D.C. based reggae band &quot;The Archives.&quot; 

The band released &quot;Saudade&quot; on March 25, 2014, via ESL Music.

On January 11, 2017, the band released the song &quot;Ghetto Matrix&quot; from their album &quot;The Temple of I &amp; I&quot;, which was released on February 10, 2017, again via their own ESL Music label.

On April 20, 2018, the band released &quot;Treasures from the Temple&quot; via ESL Music.

Throughout their career, the duo has repeatedly expressed their fondness for Brazilian culture in interviews and liner notes of their releases, especially of the 1960s Bossa Nova music movement. Some of their earlier recordings were accompanied by artwork paying specific homage to classic releases by bossa nova artists like João Gilberto (his self-titled 1973 album) or Tom Jobim (&quot;Stone Flower&quot;). Their 1997 debut album is also dedicated to the memory of Brazilian musician Antonio Carlos Jobim, who died three years earlier.

The language of the group&#x27;s lyrics throughout their career include English, Spanish, French, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian and Hindi. This reflects the group&#x27;s world music influences.

== Politics ==
Thievery Corporation has taken liberal political stances on various issues, opposing war and what they regard as exploitative trade agreements, while supporting human rights and food programs.

In September 2005, the group participated in the Operation Ceasefire concert, with the objective of ending the Iraq War.

From their press release regarding their album &quot;Radio Retaliation&quot;, Garza said:

Thievery Corporation are vocal advocates for the World Food Programme, seeing hunger as &quot;...something basic, really elemental, that transcends boundaries around the world.&quot;

As she had hoped to leave a mark for her existence, Yukana chose a career in show business and eventually becoming a voice actress. One of her earliest roles as the title character of &quot;Azuki-chan&quot; left a big impression as she portrayed an elementary school character despite being a student herself at the time of the show&#x27;s recording.

<doc id="792557" wikidata="Q1632941" url="?curid=792557" title="Hubba Bubba">
<text>Hubba Bubba is a brand of bubble gum produced by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated. Introduced in the United States in 1979, the bubble gum got its name from the phrase &quot;Hubba Hubba&quot;, which some military personnel in World War II used to express approval. The main gimmick used to promote the gum is that, as Hubba Bubba is less sticky than other brands of gum, it is easier to peel off the skin after a bubble bursts. When Hubba Bubba was first marketed, the gum&#x27;s flavor (now often referred to as &quot;original&quot;) was similar to that of others but, over time, different flavors have been produced.

==Product description== 
Before its launch, Hubba Bubba had been referred to as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; during product development and early manufacturing at the now-defunct Wrigley plant in Santa Cruz, California. The earliest series of TV commercials for Hubba Bubba that aired in the United States were set in a Wild West town and featured a character known as the Gumfighter, played by actor Don Collier. At the end of each commercial, the Gum Fighter declared, &quot;Big bubbles, no troubles,&quot; followed by a jocular response from Western film veteran Dub Taylor. This was a reference to Hubba Bubba being less sticky than other brands. Hubba Bubba&#x27;s main competition for most of the 1980s was the brand Bubblicious.

The original bubble-gum flavor was discontinued for many years in the United Kingdom, with only apple, strawberry, and cola flavors available. As of June 2012, flavors available in the UK include strawberry, original and apple. (In April 2012, the original flavor returned, with packs proclaiming &quot;chunkier and bubblier&quot;). Flavors available in Australia include cherry, cola, peach, strawberry, lime, pineapple, apple, orange, grape and watermelon. As of 2004, flavors available in Croatia included lime, berry, cherry and generic fruit. Flavors available in Germany included cherry and cola. Flavors available in Norway include orange, apple, strawberry, cola and licorice. Flavors available in Canada included strawberry, grape, orange and blue raspberry. Other flavors seen over the years in various countries include lemon, cream soda, tropical, salty liquorice, and chocolate strawberry.

This product as sold in the US includes bioengineered (Genetically Modified or “GMO”) ingredients and the company labels as such without specifying which ingredients are the un-named GMO’s. 

At first, Hubba Bubba was only available in chunks, typically being sold in packets of five chunks. More recently, it has been produced as shredded pieces (see Big League Chew), rolls of bubble gum tape in the UK (tapes of 1.8 meter strips of mixed flavors), plastic jugs of crystals, boxes of tiny gumballs and stuffed with candy. 

The Hubba Bubba brand was discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1990s but returned in 2004. In the United States, commercials are animated at Aardman in the same stop-motion style used in Wallace and Gromit, the Chevron commercials and &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. In Canada, commercials are animated in 2D traditional animation by Chuck Gammage Animation and use a duo of cartoon characters named Hubba (purple) and Bubba (pink). It was also used in the closing credits sequence on the popular YTV game show &quot;Uh Oh!&quot;.

As of 2012, Hubba Bubba is available in its original flavor called &quot;Outrageous Original&quot; in the U.S. Other flavors are &quot;Strawberry Watermelon,&quot; &quot;Cool Cola,&quot; &quot;Sweet &amp; Sassy Cherry,&quot; and &quot;Mystery Flavor&quot;. Hubba Bubba introduced Mystery Max and Mystery Tape in 2010.

<text>Jona Lewie (born John Lewis; 14 March 1947) is an English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, best known for his 1980 UK hits &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties&quot; and &quot;Stop the Cavalry&quot;.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Jona Lewie joined his first group, the Johnston City Jazz Band, while still at school in 1963, and by 1968 had become a blues and boogie singer and piano player. In 1969, as a singer/songwriter, he contributed compositions and recordings for the compilation album &quot;I Asked for Water She Gave Me... Gasoline&quot; on the Liberty/UA label. Other compositions in 1969 were for the album &quot;These Blues Is Meant to Be Barrel Housed&quot; on the Yazoo/Blue Goose label in New York, still as a solo artist known as John Lewis.

=== Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts ===
In 1969, he became acquainted with the blues band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts, which was holding a residency at London&#x27;s Studio 51 club, joining as a vocalist and piano player. When he and the band all graduated from college in June 1970, the group became professional; Lewie left the band around 1973. Brett Marvin signed to the Robert Stigwood Organisation agency in 1970, and Jona Lewie, as part of the band, appeared on television in Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, and in 1971 performed in a concert with Son House and supported Eric Clapton&#x27;s Derek and the Dominos on a UK tour. 

Lewie stayed with Brett Marvin until 1973, the band&#x27;s mainstream hit single being &quot;Seaside Shuffle&quot;, another Lewie composition, released under the moniker Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs. The record did little on first release in 1971, but in 1972 a re-release reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. A subsequent Lewie-composed Terry Dactyl track, &quot;On a Saturday Night&quot;, reached no. 42 in the UK chart in 1973, and a cover version was a hit in Spain. &quot;She Left, I Died&quot; was the third and last Lewie composition he recorded for the Terry Dactyl catalogue in May 1973, just before leaving the band.

=== Solo career ===
Not wanting his name to be the exact same as a shop on Oxford Street, and also a jazz musician, John Lewis began recording as Jona Lewie in 1974.

After the demise of Terry Dactyl, Lewie continued to write and make records, now as a solo artist for Sonet, between 1974 and 1976 including the titles &quot;Piggy Back Sue&quot; and &quot;The Swan&quot;, which were both played by BBC Radio London disc jockey Charlie Gillett, who would regularly feature them on his &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; radio show. At this time, he also helped form the short-lived band the Jive Bombers that played the established London gig circuit at such venues as the Hope and Anchor, Islington, the Greyhound, the 100 Club and the Marquee Club. The band stayed together for six months and was not able to develop a recording career, despite Ted Caroll&#x27;s offer of a record deal on his own label Chiswick Records. The band members included Iain &quot;Thumper&quot; Thompson, who went on to help form the successful chart act Darts, the guitarist Martin Stone and drummer Wilgar Campbell. This period, however, did culminate in some further recordings that achieved chart activity for Lewie in Europe as a solo recording artist, with two of his Sonet singles, &quot;Cherry Ring&quot; and &quot;Come Away (Bate O Pe)&quot;, leading to solo TV appearances in central and northern Europe.

Despite Lewie&#x27;s continuing development as a songwriter and recording artist, he did not forget his early roots as a blues and boogie-woogie pianist evidenced by Lewie providing blues piano for albums by American blues singer-guitarists Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup (&quot;Roebuck Man&quot; released on United Artists) and Juke Boy Bonner (&quot;Things Ain&#x27;t Right&quot; on Liberty) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Also he accepted Bob Hall&#x27;s invitations to the boogie-woogie piano parties that Hall threw in the seventies before he moved away from London. English boogie-woogie players of the period would often drop in to spend time with him, comparing notes and discussing styles. At one such party, Ian Stewart duetted with Bob Hall along with Lewie himself, all three in emulation of the master American triumvirate popular in the 1940s: Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson.

In August 1977, Lewie was in a pub filled with punk rockers when they learned of the passing of Elvis Presley. Since Presley was considered a musical figure in the &quot;boring old generation&quot;, the room of punkers cheered with joy; Jona, who is a long time Elvis fan, immediately broke down, ran back home, and wrote &quot;Elvis Presley Was the First Punk&quot;.

Lewie&#x27;s career continued to rise when he signed to Stiff Records in 1977. In 1980, following appearances on the Stiff package tours, he had a solo hit with the synthpop number &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties&quot; co-written with fellow Brett Marvin member Keef Trouble, which he occasionally performed live with Kirsty MacColl on backing vocals. The song made the British Top 20. His next single, &quot;Big Shot – Momentarily&quot;, was a hit in Germany but not in the UK. 

By the end of 1980, he was back in the British charts with what became his biggest UK hit, &quot;Stop the Cavalry&quot;. His subsequent 1981 release, &quot;Louise (We Get It Right)&quot; reached No. 2 in Australia, and achieved chart success in other world territories. His next two singles, &quot;Vous et Moi&quot; and &quot;The Seed That Always Died&quot;, both charted in France. Both &quot;Kitchen at Parties&quot; and &quot;Stop the Cavalry&quot; had also been hits in Germany at the times of their original releases in 1980 and 1981 respectively, and remained popular in Germany. In 2010 and 2011, both tracks achieved prominent positions in an all-time German chart that appeared in a high ratings TV show. Lewie performed the two songs on two episodes of &quot;The Ultimate Chart Show&quot; which was broadcast 2010 and 2011. He also talked on the &#x27;chat&#x27; part of the show with the aid of a German interpreter.

During the 1990s, Lewie appeared with solo public performances on a 60-day UK tour as guest of the Blues Band, playing venues such as theatres and civic centres, while occasionally playing one-off gigs such as that at the Hackney Empire, London and taking part in occasional radio and television broadcasts. In December 2005, he appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Bring Back...The Christmas Number One&quot;, along with David Essex and Slade. They only fronted, but did not play on, the studio recording session of &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot;. It failed to secure a recording contract. It was written by ex-Mud star Rob Davis, who also appeared on the show. In 2009, Lewie performed two songs at the London Ukulele Festival. The next year, Lewie joined Captain Sensible and the Glitter Band on their British tour.

== Personal life ==
Lewie was born on 14 March 1947 in Southampton into a Jewish family. His mother was Scottish. He did not know his biological father, but later learned he was a Jewish man who moved to Brooklyn, New York. His grandmother was a classical pianist, who played the piano for young Lewie, who often sang Elvis songs. At eight years old, his step father introduced him to the music of Fats Domino. He lives in Streatham with his wife and child.

<doc id="792644" wikidata="Q534589" url="?curid=792644" title="Locus of control">
<text>Locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces (beyond their influence), have control over the outcome of events in their lives. The concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality psychology. A person&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (plural &quot;loci&quot;, Latin for &quot;place&quot; or &quot;location&quot;) is conceptualized as internal (a belief that one can control one&#x27;s own life) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which the person can not influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life are primarily a result of their own actions: for example, when receiving an exam result, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities. People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the difficulty of the exam.
Locus of control has generated much research in a variety of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and clinical psychology. Debate continues whether domain-specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a personality variable linked with generalized expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept concerning explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.

Locus of control is one of the four dimensions of core self-evaluations – one&#x27;s fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven to have the ability to predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued that locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem factors may have a common core.

==History==

Locus of control as a theoretical construct derives from Julian B. Rotter&#x27;s (1954) social learning theory of personality. It is an example of a problem-solving generalized expectancy, a broad strategy for addressing a wide range of situations. In 1966 he published an article in &quot;Psychological Monographs&quot; which summarized over a decade of research (by Rotter and his students), much of it previously unpublished. In 1976, Herbert M. Lefcourt defined the perceived locus of control: &quot;...a generalised expectancy for internal as opposed to external control of reinforcements&quot;. Attempts have been made to trace the genesis of the concept to the work of Alfred Adler, but its immediate background lies in the work of Rotter and his students. Early work on the topic of expectations about control of reinforcement had been performed in the 1950s by James and Phares (prepared for unpublished doctoral dissertations supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University).

Another Rotter student, William H. James studied two types of &quot;expectancy shifts&quot;:
* &quot;Typical expectancy shifts&quot;, believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a similar outcome
* &quot;Atypical expectancy shifts&quot;, believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a dissimilar outcome

Additional research led to the hypothesis that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy were more likely to attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that people could be divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). Bernard Weiner argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus may relate to whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.

Rotter (1975, 1989) has discussed problems and misconceptions in others&#x27; use of the internal-versus-external construct.

==Personality orientation==
Rotter (1975) cautioned that internality and externality represent two ends of a continuum, not an either/or typology. &quot;Internals&quot; tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have internal locus of control believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. &quot;Externals&quot; attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. A person with an external locus of control will tend to believe that their present circumstances are not the effect of their own influence, decisions, or control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, history, the influence of powerful forces, or individually or unspecified others (such as governmental entities; corporations; racial, religious, ethnic, or fraternal groups; sexes; political affiliations; outgroups; or even perceived individual personal antagonists) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or influence its outcomes. Laying blame on others for one&#x27;s own circumstances with the implication one is owed a moral or other debt is an indicator of a tendency toward an external locus of control. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner&#x27;s work – see below – makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.

Internals were believed by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high achievement motivation and low outer-directedness. This was the basis of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter&#x27;s belief that locus of control is a single construct. Since 1970, Rotter&#x27;s assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one&#x27;s life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner&#x27;s early work in the 1970s suggested that orthogonal to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.

This new, dimensional theory meant that one could now attribute outcomes to ability (an internal stable cause), effort (an internal unstable cause), task difficulty (an external stable cause) or luck (an external, unstable cause). Although this was how Weiner originally saw these four causes, he has been challenged as to whether people see luck (for example) as an external cause, whether ability is always perceived as stable, and whether effort is always seen as changing. Indeed, in more recent publications (e.g. Weiner, 1980) he uses different terms for these four causes (such as &quot;objective task characteristics&quot; instead of &quot;task difficulty&quot; and &quot;chance&quot; instead of &quot;luck&quot;). Psychologists since Weiner have distinguished between stable and unstable effort, knowing that in some circumstances effort could be seen as a stable cause (especially given the presence of words such as &quot;industrious&quot; in English).

Regarding locus of control, there is another type of control that entails a mix among the internal and external types. People who have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as bi-locals. People who have bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People who have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to the internal and external loci of control, respectively.

==Measuring scales==
The most widely used questionnaire to measure locus of control is the 23-item (plus six filler items), forced-choice scale of Rotter (1966). However, this is not the only questionnaire; Bialer&#x27;s (1961) 23-item scale for children predates Rotter&#x27;s work. Also relevant to the locus-of-control scale are the Crandall Intellectual Ascription of Responsibility Scale (Crandall, 1965) and the Nowicki-Strickland Scale . One of the earliest psychometric scales to assess locus of control (using a Likert-type scale, in contrast to the forced-choice alternative measure in Rotter&#x27;s scale) was that devised by W. H. James for his unpublished doctoral dissertation, supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University; however, this remains unpublished.

Many measures of locus of control have appeared since Rotter&#x27;s scale. These were reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) and include those related to health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology and those specifically for children (such as the Stanford Preschool Internal-External Scale for three- to six-year-olds). Furnham and Steele (1993) cite data suggesting that the most reliable, valid questionnaire for adults is the Duttweiler scale. For a review of the health questionnaires cited by these authors, see &quot;Applications&quot; below.

The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) addresses perceived problems with the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to social desirability and heterogeneity (as indicated by factor analysis). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, &quot;they appear to be subject to many of the same problems&quot;. Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter&#x27;s scale, Duttweiler&#x27;s 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal consistency reliability (a Cronbach&#x27;s alpha of 0.85).

==Attributional style==

Attributional style (or explanatory style) is a concept introduced by Lyn Yvonne Abramson, Martin Seligman and John D. Teasdale. This concept advances a stage further than Weiner, stating that in addition to the concepts of internality-externality and stability a dimension of globality-specificity is also needed. Abramson et al. believed that how people explained successes and failures in their lives related to whether they attributed these to internal or external factors, short-term or long-term factors, and factors that affected all situations.

The topic of attribution theory (introduced to psychology by Fritz Heider) has had an influence on locus of control theory, but there are important historical differences between the two models. Attribution theorists have been predominantly social psychologists, concerned with the general processes characterizing how and why people make the attributions they do, whereas locus of control theorists have been concerned with individual differences.

Significant to the history of both approaches are the contributions made by Bernard Weiner in the 1970s. Before this time, attribution theorists and locus of control theorists had been largely concerned with divisions into external and internal loci of causality. Weiner added the dimension of stability-instability (and later controllability), indicating how a cause could be perceived as having been internal to a person yet still beyond the person&#x27;s control. The stability dimension added to the understanding of why people succeed or fail after such outcomes.

==Applications==
Locus of control&#x27;s best known application may have been in the area of health psychology, largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC. The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson&#x27;s earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one&#x27;s doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).

Some of the scales reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer&#x27;s (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff&#x27;s (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak&#x27;s (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley&#x27;s work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control in a number of fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, weight control and preventive-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.

Norman and Bennett note that some studies that compared alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism is linked to increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity has been found in studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and smoking cessation, although they also point out that there are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism is directly related to the strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.

They argue that a stronger relationship is found when health locus of control is assessed for specific domains than when general measures are taken. Overall, studies using behavior-specific health locus scales have tended to produce more positive results. These scales have been found to be more predictive of general behavior than more general scales, such as the MHLC scale. Norman and Bennett cite several studies that used health-related locus-of-control scales in specific domains (including smoking cessation), diabetes, tablet-treated diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, cancer, and heart and lung disease.

They also argue that health locus of control is better at predicting health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important moderator variable in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking internal locus of control with improved physical health, mental health and quality of life in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Whyte correlated locus of control with the academic success of students enrolled in higher-education courses. Students who were more internally controlled believed that hard work and focus would result in successful academic progress, and they performed better academically. Those students who were identified as more externally controlled (believing that their future depended upon luck or fate) tended to have lower academic-performance levels. Cassandra B. Whyte researched how control tendency influenced behavioral outcomes in the academic realm by examining the effects of various modes of counseling on grade improvements and the locus of control of high-risk college students.

Rotter also looked at studies regarding the correlation between gambling and either an internal or external locus of control. For internals, gambling is more reserved. When betting, they primarily focus on safe and moderate wagers. Externals, however, take more chances and, for example, bet more on a card or number that has not appeared for a certain period, under the notion that this card or number has a higher chance of occurring, a belief known as the gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

===Organizational psychology and religion===
Other fields to which the concept has been applied include industrial and organizational psychology, sports psychology, educational psychology and the psychology of religion. Richard Kahoe has published work in the latter field, suggesting that intrinsic religious orientation correlates positively (and extrinsic religious orientation correlates negatively) with internal locus. Of relevance to both health psychology and the psychology of religion is the work of Holt, Clark, Kreuter and Rubio (2003) on a questionnaire to assess spiritual-health locus of control. The authors distinguished between an active spiritual-health locus of control (in which &quot;God empowers the individual to take healthy actions&quot;) and a more passive spiritual-health locus of control (where health is left up to God). In industrial and organizational psychology, it has been found that internals are more likely to take positive action to change their jobs (rather than merely talk about occupational change) than externals. Locus of control relates to a wide variety of work variables, with work-specific measures relating more strongly than general measures. In Educational setting, some research has shown that students who were intrinsically motivated had processed reading material more deeply and had better academic performance than students with extrinsic motivation.

===Consumer research===
Locus of control has also been applied to the field of consumer research. For example, Martin, Veer and Pervan (2007) examined how the weight locus of control of women (i.e., beliefs about the control of body weight) influence how they react to female models in advertising of different body shapes. They found that women who believe they can control their weight (&quot;internals&quot;), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing. In contrast, women who feel powerless about their weight (&quot;externals&quot;), self-reference larger-sized models, but only prefer larger-sized models when the advertisement is for a non-fattening product. For fattening products, they exhibit a similar preference for larger-sized models and slim models. The weight locus of control measure was also found to be correlated with measures for weight control beliefs and willpower.

===Political ideology===
Locus of control has been linked to political ideology. In the 1972 U.S. presidential election, research of college students found that those with an internal locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Republican, while those with an external locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Democratic. A 2011 study surveying students at Cameron University in Oklahoma found similar results, although these studies were limited in scope. Consistent with these findings, Kaye Sweetser (2014) found that Republicans significantly displayed greater internal locus of control than Democrats and Independents.

Those with an internal locus of control are more likely to be of higher socioeconomic status, and are more likely to be politically involved (e.g., following political news, joining a political organization) Those with an internal locus of control are also more likely to vote.

==Familial origins==
The development of locus of control is associated with family style and resources, cultural stability and experiences with effort leading to reward. Many internals have grown up with families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower socioeconomic status. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.

The 1995 research of Schneewind suggests that &quot;children in large single parent families headed by women are more likely to develop an external locus of control&quot; Schultz and Schultz also claim that children in families where parents have been supportive and consistent in discipline develop internal locus of control. At least one study has found that children whose parents had an external locus of control are more likely to attribute their successes and failures to external causes. Findings from early studies on the familial origins of locus of control were summarized by Lefcourt: &quot;Warmth, supportiveness and parental encouragement seem to be essential for development of an internal locus&quot;. However, causal evidence regarding how parental locus of control influences offspring locus of control (whether genetic, or environmentally mediated) is lacking.

Locus of control becomes more internal with age. As children grow older, they gain skills which give them more control over their environment. However, whether this or biological development is responsible for changes in locus is unclear.

==Age==
Some studies showed that with age people develop a more internal locus of control, but other study results have been ambiguous. Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter. Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman&#x27;s claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.

Health locus of control is how people measure and understand how people relate their health to their behavior, health status and how long it may take to recover from a disease. Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality has a lot to do with our locus of control. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected. However, this does not necessarily mean that their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.

Age plays an important role in one&#x27;s internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.

A study published in the journal &quot;Psychosomatic Medicine&quot; examined the health effect of childhood locus of control. 7,500 British adults (followed from birth), who had shown an internal locus of control at age 10, were less likely to be overweight at age 30. The children who had an internal locus of control also appeared to have higher levels of self-esteem.

==Gender-based differences==
As Schultz and Schultz (2005) point out, significant gender differences in locus of control have not been found for adults in the U.S. population. However, these authors also note that there may be specific sex-based differences for specific categories of items to assess locus of control; for example, they cite evidence that men may have a greater internal locus for questions related to academic achievement.

A study made by Takaki and colleagues (2006) focused on the sex or gendered differences with relationship to internal locus of control and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that women who had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advice compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person&#x27;s behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor&#x27;s advice.

==Cross-cultural and regional issues==
The question of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists.

Japanese people tend to be more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry &quot;et al.&quot; pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry &quot;et al.&quot; also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in . Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.

On a less broad scale, Sims and Baumann explained how regions in the United States cope with natural disasters differently. The example they used was tornados. They &quot;applied Rotter&#x27;s theory to explain why more people have died in tornado[e]s in Alabama than in Illinois&quot;. They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their way of thinking about events that occur in their lives. Illinois residents, however, were more internal. Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado. Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.

Later studies find that these geographic differences can be explained by differences in relational mobility. Relational mobility is a measure of how much choice individuals have in terms of whom to form relationships with, including friendships, romantic partnerships, and work relations. Relational mobility is low in cultures with a subsistence economy that requires tight cooperation and coordination, such as farming, while it is high in cultures based on nomadic herding and in urban industrial cultures. 
A cross-cultural study found that the relational mobility is lowest in East Asian countries where rice farming is common, and highest in South American countries.

==Self-efficacy==

Self-efficacy refers to an individual&#x27;s belief in their capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important (see valence) to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining their own health. Self-efficacy plays an important role in one&#x27;s health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.

Smith (1989) has argued that locus of control only weakly measures self-efficacy; &quot;only a subset of items refer directly to the subject&#x27;s capabilities&quot;. Smith noted that training in coping skills led to increases in self-efficacy, but did not affect locus of control as measured by Rotter&#x27;s 1966 scale.

== Stress ==
The previous section showed how self-efficacy can be related to a person&#x27;s locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced within their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. People who report a more external locus of control also report more concurrent and future stressful experiences and higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result, they become more responsive to stress.

Veterans of the military forces who have spinal cord injuries and post-traumatic stress are a good group to look at in regard to locus of control and stress. Aging shows to be a very important factor that can be related to the severity of the symptoms of PTSD experienced by patients following the trauma of war. Research suggests that patients with a spinal cord injury benefit from knowing that they have control over their health problems and their disability, which reflects the characteristics of having an internal locus of control.

A study by Chung et al. (2006) focused on how the responses of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48, and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age does not make a difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened. However, they did mention that age did play a role in the extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.

<doc id="792684" wikidata="Q1246948" url="?curid=792684" title="Granularity">
<text>Granularity (also called graininess) is the degree to which a material or system is composed of distinguishable pieces, &quot;granules&quot; or &quot;grains&quot; (metaphorically).
It can either refer to the extent to which a larger entity is subdivided, or the extent to which groups of smaller indistinguishable entities have joined together to become larger distinguishable entities.

==Precision and ambiguity==
Coarse-grained materials or systems have fewer, larger discrete components than fine-grained materials or systems.
* A coarse-grained description of a system regards large subcomponents.
* A fine-grained description regards smaller components of which the larger ones are composed.

The concepts granularity, coarseness, and fineness are relative; and are used when comparing systems or descriptions of systems. An example of increasingly fine granularity: a list of nations in the United Nations, a list of all states/provinces in those nations, a list of all cities in those states, etc.

==Physics==
A &quot;fine-grained&quot; description of a system is a detailed, exhaustive, low-level model of it. A &quot;coarse-grained&quot; description is a model where some of this fine detail has been smoothed over or averaged out. The replacement of a fine-grained description with a lower-resolution coarse-grained model is called &quot;coarse-graining&quot;. (See for example the second law of thermodynamics)

==Molecular dynamics==
In molecular dynamics, coarse graining consists of replacing an atomistic description of a biological molecule with a lower-resolution coarse-grained model that averages or smooths away fine details.

Coarse-grained models have been developed for investigating the longer time- and length-scale dynamics that are critical to many biological processes, such as lipid membranes and proteins. These concepts not only apply to biological molecules but also inorganic molecules.

Coarse graining may remove certain degrees of freedom, such as the vibrational modes between two atoms, or represent the two atoms as a single particle. The ends to which systems may be coarse-grained is simply bound by the accuracy in the dynamics and structural properties one wishes to replicate. This modern area of research is in its infancy, and although it is commonly used in biological modeling, the analytic theory behind it is poorly understood.

==Computing==
===Parallel computing===

In parallel computing, granularity means the amount of computation in relation to communication, i.e., the ratio of computation to the amount of communication.

Fine-grained parallelism means individual tasks are relatively small in terms of code size and execution time. The data is transferred among processors frequently in amounts of one or a few memory words. Coarse-grained is the opposite: data is communicated infrequently, after larger amounts of computation.

The finer the granularity, the greater the potential for parallelism and hence speed-up, but the greater the overheads of synchronization and communication. Granularity disintegrators exist as well and are important to understand in order to determine the accurate level of granularity.

In order to attain the best parallel performance, the best balance between load and communication overhead needs to be found. If the granularity is too fine, the performance can suffer from the increased communication overhead. On the other side, if the granularity is too coarse, the performance can suffer from load imbalance.

===Reconfigurable computing and supercomputing===
In reconfigurable computing and supercomputing, these terms refer to the data path width. The use of about one-bit wide processing elements like the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in an FPGA is called fine-grained computing or fine-grained reconfigurability, whereas using wide data paths, such as, for instance, 32 bits wide resources, like microprocessor CPUs or data-stream-driven data path units (DPU]) like in a reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) is called coarse-grained computing or coarse-grained reconfigurability.

==Data and information==

The &quot;granularity&quot; of data refers to the size in which data fields are sub-divided. For example, a postal address can be recorded, with &quot;coarse granularity&quot;, as a single field:

# address = 200 2nd Ave S #358, St. Petersburg, FL 33701-4313 USA

or, with &quot;fine granularity&quot;, as multiple fields:
# street address = 200 2nd Ave S #358
# city = St. Petersburg
# state = FL
# postal code = 33701-4313
# country = USA

or even finer granularity:
# street = 2nd Ave S
# address number = 200
# suite/apartment = #358
# city = St. Petersburg
# state = FL
# postal-code = 33701
# postal-code-add-on = 4313
# country = USA

Finer granularity has overheads for data input and storage. This manifests itself in a higher number of objects and methods in the object-oriented programming paradigm or more subroutine calls for procedural programming and parallel computing environments. It does however offer benefits in flexibility of data processing in treating each data field in isolation if required. A performance problem caused by excessive granularity may not reveal itself until scalability becomes an issue.

Within database design and data warehouse design, data grain can also refer to the smallest combination of columns in a table which makes the rows (also called records) unique.

<text>A central heating system provides warmth to a number of spaces within a building from one main source of heat.

A central heating system has a furnace that converts fuel or electricity to heat through processes. The heat is circulated through the building either by fans forcing heated air through ducts, circulation of low-pressure steam to radiators in each heated room, or pumps that circulate hot water through room radiators. Primary energy sources may be fuels like coal or wood, oil, kerosene, natural gas, or electricity.

Compared with systems such as fireplaces and wood stoves, a central heating plant offers improved uniformity of temperature control over a building, usually including automatic control of the furnace. Large homes or buildings may be divided into individually controllable zones with their own temperature controls. Automatic fuel (and sometimes ash) handling provides improved convenience over separate fireplaces. Where a system includes ducts for air circulation, central air conditioning can be added to the system. A central heating system may take up considerable space in a home or other building, and may require supply and return ductwork to be installed at the time of construction.

== Overview ==
Central heating differs from space heating in that the heat generation occurs in one place, such as a furnace room or basement in a house or a mechanical room in a large building (though not necessarily at the geometrically &quot;central&quot; point). The heat is distributed throughout the building, typically by forced-air through ductwork, by water circulating through pipes, or by steam fed through pipes. The most common method of heat generation involves the combustion of fossil fuel in a furnace or boiler.

In much of the temperate climate zone, most detached housing has had central heating installed since before the Second World War. Where coal was readily available (i.e. the anthracite coal region in northeast Pennsylvania in the United States) coal-fired steam or hot water systems were common. Later in the 20th century, these were updated to burn fuel oil or gas, eliminating the need for a large coal storage bin near the boiler and the need to remove and discard coal ashes.

A cheaper alternative to hot water or steam heat is forced hot air. A furnace burns fuel oil or gas, which heats air in a heat exchanger, and blower fans circulate the warmed air through a network of ducts to the rooms in the building. This system is cheaper because the air moves through a series of ducts instead of pipes, and does not require a pipe fitter to install. The space between floor joists can be boxed in and used as some of the ductwork, further lowering costs.
Electrical heating systems occur less commonly and are practical only with low-cost electricity or when ground source heat pumps are used. Considering the combined system of thermal power station and electric resistance heating, the overall efficiency will be less than for direct use of fossil fuel for space heating.

Some other buildings utilize central solar heating, in which case the distribution system normally uses water circulation.

Alternatives to such systems are gas heaters and district heating. District heating uses the waste heat from an industrial process or electrical generating plant to provide heat for neighboring buildings. Similar to cogeneration, this requires underground piping to circulate hot water or steam.

==History==
===Ancient Korea ===

Use of the &quot;ondol&quot; has been found at archaeological sites in present-day North Korea. A Neolithic Age archaeological site, circa 5000 BC, discovered in Sonbong, Rason, in present-day North Korea, shows a clear vestige of gudeul in the excavated dwelling ().

The main components of the traditional &quot;ondol&quot; are an &quot;agungi&quot; (firebox or stove) accessible from an adjoining room (typically kitchen or master bedroom), a raised masonry floor underlain by horizontal smoke passages, and a vertical, freestanding chimney on the opposite exterior wall providing a draft. The heated floor, supported by stone piers or baffles to distribute the smoke, is covered by stone slabs, clay and an impervious layer such as oiled paper.

Early &quot;ondol&quot;s began as &quot;gudeul&quot; that provided the heating for a home and for cooking. When a fire was lit in the furnace to cook rice for dinner, the flame would extend horizontally because the flue entry was beside the furnace. This arrangement was essential, as it would not allow the smoke to travel upward, which would cause the flame to go out too soon. As the flame would pass through the flue entrance, it would be guided through the network of passages with the smoke. Entire rooms would be built on the furnace flue to create ondol floored rooms.

Ondol had traditionally been used as a living space for sitting, eating, sleeping and other pastimes in most Korean homes before the 1960s. Koreans are accustomed to sitting and sleeping on the floor, and working and eating at low tables instead of raised tables with chairs. The furnace burned mainly rice paddy straws, agricultural crop waste, biomass or any kind of dried firewood. For short-term cooking, rice paddy straws or crop waste was preferred, while long hours of cooking and floor heating needed longer-burning firewood. Unlike modern-day water heaters, the fuel was either sporadically or regularly burned (two to five times a day), depending on frequency of cooking and seasonal weather conditions.

===Ancient Rome and Greece===

The ancient Greeks originally developed central heating. The temple of Ephesus was heated by flues planted in the ground and circulating the heat which was generated by fire. Some buildings in the Roman Empire used central heating systems, conducting air heated by furnaces through empty spaces under the floors and out of pipes (called &quot;caliducts&quot;) in the walls—a system known as a &quot;hypocaust&quot;.

The Roman hypocaust continued to be used on a smaller scale during late Antiquity and by the Umayyad caliphate, while later Muslim builders employed a simpler system of underfloor pipes.

After the collapse of the Roman Empire, overwhelmingly across Europe, heating reverted to more primitive fireplaces for almost a thousand years.

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman hypocaust at some places. In Reichenau Abbey a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m2 large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.

In the 13th century, the Cistercian monks revived central heating in Christian Europe using river diversions combined with indoor wood-fired furnaces. The well-preserved Royal Monastery of Our Lady of the Wheel (founded 1202) on the Ebro River in the Aragon region of Spain provides an excellent example of such an application.

===Modern central heating systems===
The three main methods of central heating were developed in the late 18th to mid-19th centuries.

====Hot air====

William Strutt designed a new mill building in Derby with a central hot air furnace in 1793, although the idea had been already proposed by John Evelyn almost a hundred years earlier. Strutt&#x27;s design consisted of a large stove that heated air brought from the outside by a large underground passage. The air was ventilated through the building by large central ducts.

In 1807, he collaborated with another eminent engineer, Charles Sylvester, on the construction of a new building to house Derby&#x27;s Royal Infirmary. Sylvester was instrumental in applying Strutt&#x27;s novel heating system for the new hospital. He published his ideas in &quot;The Philosophy of Domestic Economy; as exemplified in the mode of Warming, Ventilating, Washing, Drying, &amp; Cooking, ... in the Derbyshire General Infirmary&quot; in 1819. Sylvester documented the new ways of heating hospitals that were included in the design, and the healthier features such as self-cleaning and air-refreshing toilets. The infirmary&#x27;s novel heating system allowed the patients to breathe fresh heated air whilst old air was channeled up to a glass and iron dome at the centre.

Their designs proved very influential. They were widely copied in the new mills of the Midlands and were constantly improved, reaching maturity with the work of de Chabannes on the ventilation of the House of Commons in the 1810s. This system remained the standard for heating small buildings for the rest of the century.

====Steam====

The English writer Hugh Plat proposed a steam-based central heating system for a greenhouse in 1594, although this was an isolated occurrence and was not followed up until the 18th century. Colonel Coke devised a system of pipes that would carry steam around the house from a central boiler, but it was James Watt the Scottish inventor who was the first to build a working system in his house.

A central boiler supplied high-pressure steam that then distributed the heat within the building through a system of pipes embedded in the columns. He implemented the system on a much larger scale at a textile factory in Manchester. Robertson Buchanan wrote the definitive description of these installations in his treatises published in 1807 and 1815. Thomas Tredgold&#x27;s work &quot;Principles of Warming and Ventilating Public Buildings&quot;, delineated the method of the application of hot steam heating to smaller, non-industrial buildings. This method had superseded the hot air systems by the late 19th century.

====Hot water====

Early hot water systems were used in Ancient Rome for heating the Thermæ. Another early hot water system was developed in Russia for central heating of the Summer Palace (1710–1714) of Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg. Slightly later, in 1716, came the first use of water in Sweden to distribute heating in buildings. Mårten Triewald, a Swedish engineer, used this method for a greenhouse at Newcastle upon Tyne. Jean Simon Bonnemain (1743–1830), a French architect, introduced the technique to industry on a cooperative, at Château du Pêcq, near Paris.

However, these scattered attempts were isolated and mainly confined in their application to greenhouses. Tredgold originally dismissed its use as impractical, but changed his mind in 1836, when the technology went into a phase of rapid development.

Early systems had used low pressure water systems, which required very large pipes. One of the first modern hot water central heating systems to remedy this deficiency was installed by Angier March Perkins in London in the 1830s. At that time central heating was coming into fashion in Britain, with steam or hot air systems generally being used.
Perkins&#x27; 1832 apparatus distributed water at 200 degrees Celsius (392 °F) through small diameter pipes at high pressure. A crucial invention to make the system viable was the thread screwed joint, that allowed the joint between the pipes to bear a similar pressure to the pipe itself. He also separated the boiler from the heat source to reduce the risk of explosion. The first unit was installed in the home of Governor of the Bank of England John Horsley Palmer so that he could grow grapes in England&#x27;s cold climate.

His systems were installed in factories and churches across the country, many of them remaining in usable condition for over 150 years. His system was also adapted for use by bakers in the heating of their ovens and in the making of paper from wood pulp.

Franz San Galli, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg, invented the radiator between 1855 and 1857, which was a major step in the final shaping of modern central heating. The Victorian cast iron radiator became widespread by the end of the 19th century as companies, such as the American Radiator Company, expanded the market for low cost radiators in the US and Europe.

==Energy sources==
The energy source selected for a central heating system varies by region. The primary energy source is selected on the basis of cost, convenience, efficiency and reliability. The energy cost of heating is one of the main costs of operating a building in a cold climate. Some central heating plants can switch fuels for reasons of economy and convenience; for example, a home owner may install a wood-fired furnace with electrical backup for occasional unattended operation.

Solid fuels such as wood, peat or coal can be stockpiled at the point of use, but are inconvenient to handle and difficult to automatically control. Wood fuel is still used where the supply is plentiful and the occupants of the building don&#x27;t mind the work involved in hauling in fuel, removing ashes, and tending the fire. Pellet fuel systems can automatically stoke the fire, but still need manual removal of ash. Coal was once an important residential heating fuel but today is uncommon, and smokeless fuel is preferred as a substitute in open fireplaces or stoves.

Liquid fuels are petroleum products such as heating oil and kerosene. These are still widely applied where other heat sources are unavailable. Fuel oil can be automatically fired in a central heating system and requires no ash removal and little maintenance of the combustion system. However, the variable price of oil on world markets leads to erratic and high prices compared to some other energy sources. Institutional heating systems (office buildings or schools, for example) can use low-grade, inexpensive bunker fuel to run their heating plants, but capital cost is high compared to more easily managed liquid fuels.

Natural gas is a widespread heating fuel in North America and northern Europe. Gas burners are automatically controlled and require no ash removal and little maintenance. However, not all areas have access to a natural gas distribution system. Liquefied petroleum gas or propane can be stored at the point of use and periodically replenished by a truck-mounted mobile tank.

Some areas have low cost electric power, making electric heating economically practical. Electric heating can either be purely resistance-type heating or make use of a heat pump system to take advantage of low-grade heat in the air or ground.

A district heating system uses centrally located boilers or water heaters and circulates heat energy to individual customers by circulating hot water or steam. This has the advantage of a central highly efficient energy converter that can use the best available pollution controls, and that is professionally operated. The district heating system can use heat sources impractical to deploy to individual homes, such as heavy oil, wood byproducts, or nuclear fission. The distribution network is more costly to build than for gas or electric heating, and so is only found in densely populated areas or compact communities.

Not all central heating systems require purchased energy. A few buildings are served by local geothermal heat, using hot water or steam from a local well to provide building heat. Such areas are uncommon. A passive solar system requires no purchased fuel but needs to be carefully designed for the site.

==Calculating output of heater required ==
Heater outputs are measured in kilowatts or BTUs per hour. For placement in a house, the heater, and the level of output required for the house, needs to be calculated. This calculation is achieved by recording a variety of factors – namely, what is above and below the room you wish to heat, how many windows there are, the type of external walls in the property and a variety of other factors that will determine the level of heat output that is required to adequately heat the space. This calculation is called a heat loss calculation and can be done with a BTU Calculator. Depending on the outcome of this calculation, the heater can be exactly matched to the house.

===Billing===
Heat output can be measured by heat cost allocators, so that each unit can be individually billed even though there is only one centralized system.

== Types of central heating ==

=== Water heating ===
Circulating hot water can be used for central heating. Sometimes these systems are called hydronic heating systems.

Common components of a central heating system using water-circulation include:
* A supply of fuel, electric power or district heating supply lines
* A boiler (or a heat exchanger for district heating) which heats water in the system
* Pump to circulate the water
* Radiators through which the heated water passes in order to release heat into rooms.

The circulating water systems use a closed loop; the same water is heated and then reheated. A sealed system provides a form of central heating in which the water used for heating circulates independently of the building&#x27;s normal water supply.

An expansion tank contains compressed gas, separated from the sealed-system water by a diaphragm. This allows for normal variations of pressure in the system. A safety valve allows water to escape from the system when pressure becomes too high, and a valve can open to replenish water from the normal water supply if the pressure drops too low. Sealed systems offer an alternative to open-vent systems, in which steam can escape from the system, and gets replaced from the building&#x27;s water supply via a feed and central storage system.

Heating systems in the United Kingdom and in other parts of Europe commonly combine the needs of space heating with domestic hot-water heating. These systems occur less commonly in the USA. In this case, the heated water in a sealed system flows through a heat exchanger in a hot-water tank or hot-water cylinder where it heats water from the regular potable water supply for use at hot-water taps or appliances such as washing machines or dishwashers.

Hydronic radiant floor heating systems use a boiler or district heating to heat water and a pump to circulate the hot water in plastic pipes installed in a concrete slab. The pipes, embedded in the floor, carry heated water that conducts warmth to the surface of the floor, where it broadcasts heat energy to the room above. Hydronic heating systems are also used with antifreeze solutions in ice and snow melt systems for walkways, parking lots and streets. They are more commonly used in commercial and whole house radiant floor heat projects, whereas electric radiant heat systems are more commonly used in smaller &quot;spot warming&quot; applications.

===Steam heating===
A steam heating system takes advantage of the high latent heat which is given off when steam condenses to liquid water. In a steam heating system, each room is equipped with a radiator which is connected to a source of low-pressure steam (a boiler). Steam entering the radiator condenses and gives up its latent heat, returning to liquid water. The radiator in turn heats the air of the room, and provides some direct radiant heat. The condensate water returns to the boiler either by gravity or with the assistance of a pump. Some systems use only a single pipe for combined steam and condensate return. Since trapped air prevents proper circulation, such systems have vent valves to allow air to be purged. In domestic and small commercial buildings, the steam is generated at relatively low gauge pressure, less than .

Steam heating systems are rarely installed in new single-family residential construction owing to the cost of the piping installation. Pipes must be carefully sloped to prevent trapped condensate blockage. Compared to other methods of heating, it is more difficult to control the output of a steam system. However, steam can be sent, for example, between buildings on a campus to allow use of an efficient central boiler and low cost fuel. Tall buildings take advantage of the low density of steam to avoid the excessive pressure required to circulate hot water from a basement-mounted boiler. In industrial systems, process steam used for power generation or other purposes can also be tapped for space heating. Steam for heating systems may also be obtained from heat recovery boilers using otherwise wasted heat from industrial processes.

===Electric heating===

Electric heating or resistance heating converts electricity directly to heat. Electric heat is often more expensive than heat produced by combustion appliances like natural gas, propane, and oil. Electric resistance heat can be provided by baseboard heaters, space heaters, radiant heaters, furnaces, wall heaters, or thermal storage systems.

Electric heaters are usually part of a fan coil which is part of a central air conditioner. They circulate heat by blowing air across the heating element which is supplied to the furnace through return air ducts. Blowers in electric furnaces move air over one to five resistance coils or elements which are usually rated at five kilowatts. The heating elements activate one at a time to avoid overloading the electrical system. Overheating is prevented by a safety switch called a limit controller or limit switch. This limit controller may shut the furnace off if the blower fails or if something is blocking the air flow. The heated air is then sent back through the home through supply ducts.

In larger commercial applications, central heating is provided through an air handler which incorporates similar components as a furnace but on a larger scale.

A data furnace uses computers to convert electricity into heat while simultaneously processing data.

===Heat pumps===
An air source heat pump can be used to air condition the building during hot weather, and to warm the building using heat extracted from outdoor air in cold weather. Air-source heat pumps are generally uneconomic for outdoor temperatures much below freezing. In colder climates, geothermal heat pumps can be used to extract heat from the ground. For economy, these systems are designed for average low winter temperatures and use supplemental heating for extreme low temperature conditions. The advantage of the heat pump is that it reduces the purchased energy required for building heating; often geothermal source systems also supply domestic hot water. Even in places where fossil fuels provide most electricity, a geothermal system may offset greenhouse gas production since most of the heat is supplied from the surrounding environment, with only 15–30% as electrical consumption.

== Environmental aspects==
Public and commercial properties are directly and indirectly responsible for 30% of the final energy consumed around the world, including almost 55% of global electricity consumption. Heating is currently responsible for around 45% of building emissions, and still relying on fossil fuels for supplying more than 55% of its final energy consumption.

Around 4.3 Gt of were released to the atmosphere in 2019 for heating in buildings when accounting for emissions from direct fossil fuel combustion as well as from upstream electricity and heat generation. This represents nearly 12% of global energy and process-related emissions.

From an energy-efficiency standpoint considerable heat gets lost or goes to waste if only a single room needs heating, since central heating has distribution losses and (in the case of forced-air systems particularly) may heat some unoccupied rooms without need. In such buildings which require isolated heating, one may wish to consider non-central systems such as individual room heaters, fireplaces or other devices. Alternatively, architects can design new buildings which can virtually eliminate the need for heating, such as those built to the Passive House standard.

However, if a building does need full heating, combustion central heating may offer a more environmentally friendly solution than electric resistance heating. This applies when electricity originates from a fossil fuel power station, with up to 60% of the energy in the fuel lost (unless utilized for district heating) and about 6% in transmission losses. In Sweden proposals exist to phase out direct electric heating for this reason (see oil phase-out in Sweden). Nuclear, wind, solar and hydroelectric sources reduce this factor.

In contrast, hot-water central heating systems can use water heated in or close to the building using high-efficiency condensing boilers, biofuels, or district heating. Wet underfloor heating has proven ideal. This offers the option of relatively easy conversion in the future to use developing technologies such as heat pumps and solar combisystems, thereby also providing future-proofing.

Typical efficiencies for central heating (measured at the customer&#x27;s purchase of energy) are:
* 65–97% for -fired heating;
* 80–89% for -fired and
* 45–60% for -fired heating.

Oil storage tanks, especially underground storage tanks, can also impact the environment.
