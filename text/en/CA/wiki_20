<text>John Nelson (June 1, 1791 – January 18, 1860) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the Attorney General of the United States from 1843 to 1845 under President John Tyler. He served as the first United States Chargé d&#x27;Affaires to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1831 to 1832 and as the U.S. representative for Maryland&#x27;s 4th district from 1821 to 1823.

==Early life==
Nelson was born in Frederick, Maryland on June 1, 1791. He was the fourth child of Roger Nelson and Mary Brooke (née Sim) Nelson (d. 1794). Among his siblings was Madison Nelson, Frederick Stembel Nelson, and Sarah (née Nelson) Maulsby. His father served as Brigadier general during the Revolutionary War (and one of the original members of the Society of Cincinnati) and, later, a U.S. Representative.

He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1811, and was admitted to the bar in 1813, starting practice in Frederick.

==Career==
He held several local offices before being elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Maryland&#x27;s 4th district. He served only one term, March 4, 1821, to March 3, 1823, and was not a candidate for reelection. Nelson received an A.M. degree from Princeton University in 1825.

In 1831, he was appointed Chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Two Sicilies, a position he served in from 1831 to 1832.

President John Tyler appointed him Attorney General of the United States on July 1, 1843. He served in this position until the end of the Tyler administration. He also served as United States Secretary of State ad interim for about a month in 1844 after the sudden death of the previous Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur.

After the end of the Tyler administration, Nelson retired from public life and returned to Baltimore.

==Personal life==
Nelson was married to Frances Harriott Burrows (1798–1836), a daughter of William Ward Burrows I, the second Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the sister of William Ward Burrows II, a decorated officer in the United States Navy. Together, they were the parents of:

* Mary Sim Nelson (1819–1880), who married Alexander Neill (1808–1865).
* Rosa Londonia Nelson (1825–1894), who married Isaac Nevett Steele (1809–1891), brother of John Nevett Steele, and Mary Nevett Steele (the wife of John Campbell Henry, eldest son and heir of Maryland Governor John Henry).

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1836, he married Matilda Tennant (d. 1862), the daughter of Thomas Tennant, on March 13, 1838. Matilda and John were the parents of two children:

* Joseph Story Nelson
* Tennant Nelson

Nelson died in Baltimore, Maryland, on January 8, 1860.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter, he was the grandfather of Charles Steele, who was born in Baltimore and later spent 39 years as a partner in J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in New York City.

<doc id="762752" wikidata="Q164463" url="?curid=762752" title="Larry O'Brien">
<text>Lawrence Francis O&#x27;Brien Jr. (July 7, 1917September 28, 1990) was an American politician and basketball commissioner. He was one of the United States Democratic Party&#x27;s leading electoral strategists for more than two decades. He was Postmaster General in the cabinet of President Lyndon Johnson and chair of the Democratic National Committee. O&#x27;Brien was also commissioner of the National Basketball Association from 1975 to 1984, and the NBA Championship Trophy is named after him.

O&#x27;Brien, son of Irish immigrants, was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. When he was not working in politics, O&#x27;Brien managed his family&#x27;s real estate and worked in public relations.

==Early life and politics==
O&#x27;Brien was born on July 7, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts. He learned about politics at a young age. His father, a local leader of the Democratic Party, recruited him at 11 years old to serve locally as a volunteer in the 1928 presidential campaign of Al Smith. O&#x27;Brien became a passionate Democrat. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law in 1942 at the Northeastern University – Springfield Division, now known as the Western New England University School of Law. O&#x27;Brien was married to the former Elva Brassard in 1945. They had one son, Lawrence F. O&#x27;Brien III, who became a lobbyist.

He was appointed in 1946, 1948, and 1950 by his friend Foster Furcolo to serve locally as the director of his U.S. House of Representatives election campaigns. O&#x27;Brien was appointed in 1952 by John F. Kennedy to serve in Massachusetts as the director of his successful U.S. Senate election campaign and, in 1958, to serve in Massachusetts as the director of his successful reelection campaign. Kennedy&#x27;s elections were largely attributed to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s recruitment, his use of volunteers, and his insistence upon reaching voters in every corner of every state.

In 1959, he built the foundation for Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign by canvassing the United States and working to connect with state Democratic stakeholders. O&#x27;Brien was appointed as Kennedy&#x27;s national campaign director. His election planning in key primary states such as Wisconsin and West Virginia helped to defuse the anxiety of party heavyweights about Kennedy&#x27;s Catholicism.

In 1960, he was appointed by President-elect Kennedy to recruit staff for his administration and subsequently took on the job 1961 as the special assistant to the president for congressional relations and personnel. O&#x27;Brien also had a major role in awarding patronage as one of President Kennedy&#x27;s inner circle of trusted advisers. 

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s grassroots campaign strategies eventually inspired a new trend in Democratic party primary and general election processes, employing his &quot;statewide strategy&quot; as an update to traditional reliance on major city &quot;political machines&quot;. As DNC chair he established a control structure for communications with state delegates and &quot;dignitaries&quot; which exists to this day; an achievement which cemented his role as perennial party leadership candidate. 

O&#x27;Brien accompanied President Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy on their trip to Texas in November 1963 and was riding in the motorcade in Dallas. As such he was an eyewitness to the assassination of President Kennedy. After the president was declared dead, O&#x27;Brien accompanied the coffin and Jackie Kennedy back to Air Force One at Love Field in Dallas. While aboard Air Force One, President Johnson called for O&#x27;Brien and Kenny O&#x27;Donnell, asking both of them to stay on and work with him in the new administration. Although O&#x27;Brien had never been close to Johnson (and many writers, including Johnson biographer Robert Caro, reported that O&#x27;Brien did not like or trust Johnson), he remained at the White House and worked for the new president. 

O&#x27;Brien was appointed as President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s campaign director in 1964. A newly elected Johnson appointed O&#x27;Brien to serve as special assistant to the president for congressional relations and personnel which continued through 1965 when O&#x27;Brien was appointed U.S. Postmaster General.

Then in 1968 after Johnson refused to seek the Democratic nomination again, O&#x27;Brien reclaimed a position as Senator Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign advisor. After RFK was assassinated, Vice President Hubert Humphrey hired O&#x27;Brien to serve as his national presidential campaign director.

O&#x27;Brien was also elected as national DNC chairman in 1968 on the tails of his Humphrey campaign job. He became infamous during the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago by engineering a series of party convention rule changes which served to exclude Eugene McCarthy delegates from certain roles in the convention and disallowed commentary on Humphrey&#x27;s Vietnam War involvement. After re-election as chair in 1970, it was in this role that he became a central figure in both the Watergate scandal and the &quot;Eagleton Affair&quot; in 1972.

The DNC Lawrence O&#x27;Brien Award was created in 1992 by his family and the Democratic Party leaders to acknowledge the many years of service he gave to the party, his belief in the importance of volunteer contribution, and his role as counter-fixer to Cohn, Stone, and Mitchell et al. In his varied roles during the 1960s and early 1970s, O&#x27;Brien defined the role that we now recognize as the modern Democratic Party &quot;Insider&quot;: someone who strategically inter-connects national and state party campaign fund-raising and is rewarded with governmental roles in which he then funnels favors back to those funders (not a new concept, but a modern iteration made more challenging by slowly evolving campaign finance laws.) 

===Government===
His first post in Washington was in 1948 as Rep. Foster Furcolo&#x27;s administrative assistant. 

He lobbied successfully during President Kennedy&#x27;s first year for the expansion of the U.S. House of Representatives Standing Committee on rules to ensure a liberal and moderate majority. O&#x27;Brien also lobbied for increasing the minimum wage. In 1962 he acted as President Kennedy&#x27;s liaison to the Democratic Party during its mid-term election campaigns.

During his tenure as Postmaster General, in September 1967, the Post Office Department cancelled many &quot;mail by rail&quot; contracts, electing to move First Class mail via air and road transport. This had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues and led directly to the end of many passenger rail routes which had relied on mail contracts to supplement their income (see: Railway post office).

The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration Lawrence F. O&#x27;Brien Gallery was named and opened in 2004 in his memory.

==NBA commissioner==
Appointed commissioner in 1975, O&#x27;Brien oversaw the ABA–NBA merger and negotiated a broadcast agreement with CBS Television while seeing game attendance significantly increase. In response to public relations issues after the merger, O&#x27;Brien pushed for an anti-drug agreement with the NBA Players Association to improve the league&#x27;s image. And, although the merger and expansion had solidified the NBA brand and games were broadcast live on weekend days, it still did not have the TV exposure of other pro sports. In the late 70s, and even into 1980 season, CBS was showing only tape-delayed broadcasts of weekday NBA playoff and Finals games after the late news. CBS would ultimately become synonymous with the great NBA Finals battles of the 1980s. 

After retirement (1984), in honor of his service to the sport, the NBA Championship Trophy was renamed as the Larry O&#x27;Brien NBA Championship Trophy.
O&#x27;Brien was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991, located at his birthplace, Springfield, Massachusetts.

<text>PC-1237 was a in the service of the United States Navy. She was later given the name &quot;Abingdon&quot; after the town of Abingdon, Virginia.

&quot;PC-1237&quot;, hull No. 3141, was laid down on 14 February 1943 at Consolidated Shipbuilding Corp., in Morris Heights, New York; launched on 3 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. David Challinor; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 26 July 1943 with Lieutenant J. F. Weller, Jr., USNR, in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
After fitting out, &quot;PC-1237&quot; departed New York on 10 August 1943 for New London, Connecticut, arriving there the following day. The submarine chaser then conducted tests under the auspices of the Bureau of Ships for the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London, Connecticut for the remainder of August. &quot;PC-1237&quot; cleared that port on 1 September 1943 for points south; proceeding via Tompkinsville, the ship reached Miami soon thereafter and commenced shakedown training. She completed these evolutions early in October and, proceeding by way of Key West arrived in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on 12 September.

&quot;PC-1237&quot; began escorting convoys between Guantánamo Bay and Trinidad soon thereafter, occasionally touching at Kingston, Jamaica, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, during that time period. She performed that duty until early in 1945. At the beginning of February 1945, the submarine chaser was reassigned to temporary duty conducting tests at Antigua for the Naval Research Laboratory, an assignment that occupied her through the remainder of World War II and the early months of 1946. Late in this period, she visited Frederikstad, St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, for a port call on Navy Day, 27 October 1945.

===Post-war operations===
On 24 May 1946, &quot;PC-1237&quot; departed San Juan and began a voyage that took her northward along the east coast of the United States, touching at Miami and Norfolk en route, and then up the St. Lawrence River to the Great Lakes. There, the ship began training naval reservists of the 9th Naval District.

&quot;PC-1237&quot; continued naval reserve training duty until she was placed out of commission, in reserve, in October 1949, and was berthed at Norfolk with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet for almost a decade. During that time, in February 1956, she was named &quot;Abingdon&quot;. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1959, but her subsequent fate is not known.

<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 1422, adopted unanimously on 12 July 2002, after noting the recent entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Council granted immunity from prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to United Nations peacekeeping personnel from countries that were not party to the ICC.

The resolution was passed at the insistence of the United States, which threatened to veto the renewal of all United Nations peacekeeping missions (including the renewal of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina passed the same day) unless its citizens were shielded from prosecution by the ICC. Resolution 1422 came into effect on 1 July 2002 for a period of one year. It was renewed for twelve months by Resolution 1487, passed on 12 June 2003. However, the Security Council refused to renew the exemption again in 2004 after pictures emerged of U.S. troops abusing Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib, and the U.S. withdrew its demand.

==Resolution==
===Observations===
In the preamble of the resolution, the Council noted the importance of United Nations operations in the maintenance of peace and security. It noted that not all countries were party to the ICC Statute or had chosen to accept its jurisdiction, and would continue to fulfil their responsibilities within their national jurisdictions with regard to international crimes.

===Acts===
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council requested that the ICC, for a twelve-month period beginning on 1 July 2002, refrain from commencing or continuing investigations into personnel or officials from states not a party to the ICC Statute. It expressed its intention to renew the measure within twelve months for as long as necessary. Furthermore, the resolution asked that states were to take no actions contrary to the measure and their international obligations.

<doc id="762761" wikidata="Q919472" url="?curid=762761" title="British Home Championship">
<text>The British Home Championship (historically known as the British International Championship or simply the International Championship) was an annual football competition contested between the United Kingdom&#x27;s four national teams: England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (the last of whom competed as Northern Ireland starting from the late 1950s). Beginning during the 1883–84 season, it is the oldest international association football tournament in the world and it was contested until the 1983–84 season, when it was abolished after 100 years.

==History==
===Overview===
The first international association football match, between Scotland and England, took place in November 1872. Following that contest, a schedule of international matches between the four home nations gradually developed, the games taking place between January and April of each year. In 1884, for the first time, all six possible matches were played. This schedule (the climax usually being the England v Scotland fixture, the outcome of which was often pivotal in determining the champion) continued without interruption until the First World War.

===Development===
Recognition of the international season as constituting a single tournament came slowly. Early reports focused on the rivalries between the two teams in each match, rather than any overall title. Talk of a &quot;championship&quot; began to emerge gradually during the 1890s, with some writers suggesting the use of a league table between the nations, with 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw (as had been in use for the Football League since 1888). By 1908 a list of &quot;International Champions&quot; extending all the way back to 1884 was published.

The championship, although increasingly recognised as such, had no official prize until 1935 (see below), when a trophy for the &quot;British International Championship&quot; was created in honour of the silver jubilee of King George V.

The dates of the fixtures varied, but they tended to bunch towards the end of the season (sometimes the entire competition was held in a few days at the end of the season), except between the World Wars, when some fixtures were played before Christmas. The rise of other international competitions, especially the World Cup and European Championships, meant that the British Home Championship lost much of its prestige as the years went on.

However, the new international tournaments meant that the Championship took on added importance in certain years. The 1949–50 and 1953–54 Championships doubled up as qualifying groups for the 1950 and 1954 World Cups respectively, and the results of the 1966–67 and 1967–68 Championships were used to determine which team would progress to the second qualifying round of Euro 1968.

The British Home Championship was discontinued after the 1983–84 competition. There were a number of reasons for the tournament&#x27;s demise, including it being overshadowed by the World Cup and European Championships, falling attendances at all but the England v Scotland games, fixture congestion, the rise of hooliganism, the Troubles in Northern Ireland (civil unrest led to the 1980–81 competition being abandoned), and England&#x27;s desire to play against &quot;stronger&quot; teams. The fate of the competition was settled when the (English) Football Association, swiftly followed by the Scottish Football Association, announced in 1983 that they would not be entering after the 1983–84 Championship. The British Home Championship trophy remains the property of the Irish FA, as Northern Ireland were the most recent champions.

The Championship was replaced by the smaller Rous Cup, which involved just England, Scotland and, in later years, an invited guest team from South America. That competition, however, ended after just five years.

Since then, there have been many proposals to resurrect the British Home Championship, with advocates pointing to rising attendances and a significant downturn in football-related violence. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations are keen on the idea, but the English association are less enthusiastic, claiming that they agree in principle, but that fixture congestion makes a revived tournament impractical.

Therefore, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales and the Irish Football Association, with the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Football Association of Ireland, pressed ahead and organised a tournament similar to the British Home Championship. The Nations Cup, between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was launched in Dublin in 2011. It was discontinued after one tournament because of poor attendance.

==Format and rules==

Each team played every other team once (making for a total of three matches per team and six matches in total). Generally, each team played either one or two matches at home and the remainder away, with home advantage between two teams alternating each year (so if England played Scotland at home one year, they played them away the next).

A team received two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The team with the most points was declared the winner. If two or more teams were equal on points, that position in the league table was shared (as was the Championship if it occurred between the top teams). In 1956, uniquely, all teams finished with the same number of points, leading to the Championship being shared between all four home nations. From the 1978–79 Championship onwards, however, goal difference (total goals scored minus total goals conceded) was used to differentiate between teams level on points. If goal difference was equal, then total goals scored was used.

==Trophy==
Early editions of the tournament had no trophy. In 1935, a trophy was presented to King George V by the Football Association in recognition of the monarch&#x27;s silver jubilee. It was first awarded, as the &quot;Jubilee Trophy&quot;, to Scotland, victors of the 1935–36 competition. The trophy was of solid silver, consisting of a pedestal supporting a football surmounted by a winged figure. It bore the words &quot;British International Championship&quot;.

As winners of the final tournament, Northern Ireland retained the trophy, but for many years had no suitable venue in which to display it. It was exhibited in the Scottish Football Museum and then the National Football Museum in Manchester. In 2018 it was finally put in display at the &quot;Northern Ireland Education and Heritage Centre&quot; at the National Stadium.

==Notable moments==

===1902: Tragedy at Ibrox===
The Scotland v England match of 5 April 1902 became known as the Ibrox Disaster of 1902. The match took place at Ibrox Park (now Ibrox Stadium) in Glasgow. During the first half, a section of the terracing in the overcrowded West Stand collapsed, killing 25 and injuring over 500. Play was stopped, but was restarted after 20 minutes, with most of the crowd not knowing what had happened. The match was later declared void and replayed at Villa Park, Birmingham.

===1950–54: World Cup qualification===
The 1949–50 British Home Championship was used as a qualification group for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, with the teams finishing both first and second qualifying. England and Scotland were guaranteed the top two places and World Cup qualification with one match to go, when the Scottish Football Association declared that it would only go to the 1950 World Cup if they were the British champions. Scotland played England at Hampden Park on 15 April in the final game and lost 1–0 to a goal by Chelsea&#x27;s Roy Bentley. Scotland finished second and withdrew from what would have been their first-ever World Cup appearance.

The 1953–54 British Home Championship was used as a qualification group for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with England and Scotland both qualifying.

===1967: Scotland become &#x27;World Champions&#x27;===
The 1966–67 British Home Championship was the first since England&#x27;s victory at the World Cup 1966. Naturally, England were favourites for the Championship title. In the end, the outcome of the entire Championship rested on the final game: England v Scotland at Wembley Stadium in London on 15 April. If England won or drew, they would win the Championship; if Scotland won, they would triumph. Scotland beat the World Cup winners 3–2. The match was followed by a large, but relatively harmless, pitch invasion by the jubilant Scottish fans, who were quick to declare Scotland the &quot;World Champions&quot;, as the game was England&#x27;s first defeat since winning the World Cup. The Scots&#x27; joke ultimately led to the conception of the Unofficial Football World Championships.
===1966–68: European Football Championship qualification ===

One of the qualifying groups for the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship was formed by combining the results of the 1966–67 and 1967–68 editions of the British Home Championship. The group winners were England, who advanced to the UEFA Euro 1968 quarter-finals where they defeated Spain to qualify for the final tournament, hosted by Italy. 

===1977: Wembley pitch invasion===
Again, the 1976–77 Championship came down to the final game between England and Scotland at Wembley on 4 June. Scotland won the game 2–1, making them champions. As in 1967, a pitch invasion by the overjoyed Scottish fans followed, but this time vandalism ensued: the pitch was ripped up and taken back to Scotland in small pieces, along with one of the broken crossbars.

===1981: The unfinished Championship===
The Troubles in Northern Ireland had affected the British Home Championship before, with things turning so hostile that Northern Ireland often had to play their &quot;home&quot; games in Liverpool or Glasgow. The entire 1980–81 Championship was held in May 1981, which coincided with a large amount of civil unrest in Northern Ireland surrounding the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. Northern Ireland&#x27;s two home matches, against England and Wales, were not moved, so both teams refused to travel to Belfast to play. As not all the matches were completed, that year&#x27;s competition was declared void with no winner; only Scotland completed all their matches. It was the only time in the Championship&#x27;s history, apart from during World War I and World War II, that it was not awarded.

===1984: The final Championship===
The Home Championships came to an end, with England and Scotland announcing that the 1983–84 British Home Championship would be their last. They cited waning interest in the games, crowded international fixture lists and a sharp rise in hooliganism for their decision. The final match of the Championship was held at Hampden Park between Scotland and England in which the winners of the game would win the final Championship. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, allowing Northern Ireland to win the Championship on goal difference after all the teams ended on three points each; Wales came second on goals scored.

<text>A baked potato, known in the United Kingdom as a jacket potato, is a preparation of potato originating from Peru. It may be served with fillings, toppings or condiments such as butter, cheese, sour cream, gravy, baked beans and tuna.

Some varieties of potato, such as Russet and King Edward, are more suitable for baking, owing to their size and consistency. Despite the popular misconception that potatoes are fattening, baked potatoes can be part of a healthy diet.

==Preparation==
Potatoes can be baked in a conventional gas or electric oven, a convection oven, a microwave oven, on a barbecue grill, or on (or in) an open fire. Some restaurants use special ovens designed specifically to cook large numbers of potatoes, then keep them warm and ready for service.

Prior to cooking, the potato is ideally scrubbed clean, washed and dried, with eyes and surface blemishes removed, and rubbed with oil or butter and/or salt. Pricking the potato with a fork or knife allows steam to escape during the cooking process and prevent accidental explosions/rupturing of the potato skin and flesh due to accumulate steam pressure inside. Potatoes cooked in a microwave oven without pricking the skin are especially susceptible due to rapid fluctuations in heat. 

It takes between one and two hours to bake a large potato in a conventional oven at . Microwaving takes from six to twelve minutes depending on oven power and potato size, but does not generally produce a crisp skin. Some recipes call for use of both a microwave and a conventional oven, with the microwave being used to vent most of the steam prior to the cooking process.

Wrapping the potato in aluminium foil before cooking in a standard oven will retain moisture, while leaving it unwrapped will result in a crisp skin. Cooking over an open fire or in the coals of a barbecue may require wrapping in foil to prevent burning of the skin. A potato buried directly in coals of a fire cooks well, albeit with a mostly burned and inedible skin. A baked potato is fully cooked when its internal temperature reaches .

Once a potato has been baked, some people discard the skin and eat only the interior, while others enjoy the taste and texture of the skin, which is rich in dietary fiber. Potatoes baked in their skins may lose between 20 and 40% of their vitamin C content, because heating in air is slow and vitamin inactivation can continue for a long time. Small potatoes bake more quickly than large ones and therefore retain more of their vitamin C.

==Variations==
Some people bake their potatoes and then scoop out the interior, leaving the skin as a shell. The white interior flesh can then be mixed with various other food items such as cheese, butter, or bacon bits. This mixture is then spooned back into the skin shells and they are replaced in the oven to warm. These are known variously as loaded potato skins, filled potatoes and twice-baked potatoes. 

In Great Britain, toppings or fillings include baked beans, curried chicken, coronation chicken, chili con carne, shredded cheese, tuna mayonnaise, and coleslaw. In Scotland even haggis is used as a filling for jacket potatoes.

A variation is Hasselback potatoes, in which the potato is cut into thin slices almost down to the bottom, so that the potato still holds its shape, and is then baked in the oven, occasionally scalloped with cheese. The name &quot;Hasselback&quot; refers to the luxurious Hasselbacken hotel and restaurant in Stockholm, which originated this dish.

==Regional variations==


===North America===
Many restaurants serve baked potatoes with sides such as butter, sour cream, chives, shredded cheese, and bacon bits. Sides are usually optional and customers can order as many or as few as they wish. Baked potatoes that are served with a number of these sides are commonly referred to as &quot;loaded potatoes&quot; or &quot;loaded baked potatoes&quot;. These potatoes can themselves be a side item to a steak dinner, or a similar entree. 

Large and stuffed baked potatoes may be served as an entree, usually filled with meat in addition to any of the ingredients mentioned above. Barbecued or smoked meat or chili is substituted. Vegetables such as broccoli may also be added.

====Idaho====
Of US states, Idaho is the major producer of potatoes. The Idaho baked potato was heavily promoted by the Northern Pacific Railroad in the early 20th century, often using Hollywood movie stars.

Hazen Titus was appointed as the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s dining car superintendent in 1908. He talked to Yakima Valley farmers who complained that they were unable to sell their potato crops because their potatoes were simply too large, so they fed them to hogs instead. Titus learned that a single potato could weigh from two to five pounds, with smaller potatoes preferred by the end buyers of the vegetable and that many considered them not to be edible because their thick, rough skin made them difficult to cook.

Titus and his staff discovered the &quot;inedible&quot; potatoes were delicious after baking in a slow oven. He contracted to purchase as many potatoes as the farmers could produce that were more than two pounds in weight. Soon after the first delivery of &quot;Netted Gem Bakers&quot;, they were offered to diners on the North Coast Limited beginning in 1909. Word of the line&#x27;s specialty offering traveled quickly, and before long it was using &quot;the Great Big Baked Potato&quot; as a slogan to promote the railroad&#x27;s passenger service.

When an addition was built for the Northern Pacific&#x27;s Seattle commissary in 1914, a reporter wrote, &quot;A large trade mark, in the shape of a baked potato, 40 ft. long and 18 ft. in diameter, surmounts the roof. The potato is electric lighted and its eyes, through the electric mechanism, are made to wink constantly. A cube of butter thrust into its split top glows intermittently.&quot; Premiums such as postcards, letter openers, and spoons were produced to promote &quot;The Route of the Great Big Baked Potato&quot;. The slogan served the Northern Pacific for about 50 years. The song &quot;Great Big Baked Potato&quot; (words by N.R. Streeter and H. Caldwell, music by Oliver George) was written about this potato.

===United Kingdom===
A baked potato is sometimes called a &quot;jacket potato&quot; in the United Kingdom. The baked potato has been popular in the UK for many years. In the mid-19th century, jacket potatoes were sold on the streets by hawkers during the autumn and winter months. In London, it was estimated that some 10 tons of baked potatoes were sold each day by this method. Common jacket potato fillings (or &quot;toppings&quot;) in the United Kingdom include, roasted vegetables, grated cheddar cheese, baked beans, tuna mayonnaise, chili con carne, and chicken curry. 

Baked potatoes are often eaten on Guy Fawkes Night. Traditionally they were often baked in the glowing embers of a bonfire.

===France===
A baked potato is called &quot;pomme de terre au four&quot; in French. It may be served as an accompaniment to a meat dish, or, in a fast-food restaurant called a &quot;pataterie&quot;, be the centre of a meal.

===Armenia===
A regional variation of the baked potato is known in rural Armenian villages surrounding Lake Sevan as &quot;p&#x27;ur&quot; (). Dried cow dung is stacked and used as fuel to slowly bake unseasoned potatoes which are placed in the center. 

===Turkey===

&quot;Kumpir&quot; (from Bulgarian компир, &quot;potato&quot;), a baked potato with various fillings, is a popular fast food in Turkey. In its basic form, it is made with potatoes that are wrapped with foil and baked in special ovens. The potatoes are sliced down the middle and the insides are mixed with unsalted butter and puréed with kaşar cheese. All sorts of foods can be added to the potato: mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, sweetcorn, sausage slices, carrots, mushrooms and Russian salad. The cafés in Ortaköy, Istanbul, make &quot;kumpir&quot; that are especially popular with the tourists and offer even more ingredients.

===Russia===
Although baked potato with various fillings is not considered a traditional Russian dish, it has recently been gaining popularity as a fast food.

===Brazil===
The baked potato is reasonably popular in Brazil, where it is sometimes known as &quot;batata Inglesa&quot;, lit. translated as &#x27;English potato&#x27;, likely due to the use of an English variety of potato: the &#x27;King Edward&#x27;.

<text>:&quot;See British Home Championship for the football competition.&quot; - 
The British Championship is the most prestigious ice hockey cup competition in the United Kingdom, and also the longest established ice hockey competition.

The competition is effectively the post-season playoffs of the first-tier league in the country to determine the British champions for the season. They are therefore held after the regular season, whereby the positions in the league ladder determine entry and seeding. The first placed team in the league is considered to have won the national league title as a separate title, but the British champion for the season is historically considered to be the winner of the post-season playoffs.

In its current format, the eight highest placed teams in the first-tier Elite Ice Hockey League contest quarter finals, the winners going on to semi finals and then the deciding one-leg final.

==Early years==

There were three instances of an early championship; the first was in the 1929-30 British Ice Hockey season which was the inaugural season of organised league ice hockey in Britain. The championship was won by London Lions when known as the Patton Cup. The second edition the following season was abandoned after Manchester and Glasgow couldn&#x27;t agree on dates for their semi-final tie. The winner was to have met the English Club champions London Lions in the final. The third instance took place during the 1959–60 British National League season.

==Modern edition==

From 1966 it became an annual event when known as the &quot;Icy Smith Cup&quot; and then after 1982 it had several sponsors and names including the &quot;Heineken Championship Cup&quot; and latterly as the &quot;Sekonda Playoff Championship Cup&quot;. Some contests were only recognised as representing the Championship retroactively. At present, the Championship is called the &quot;Twinings Tea Cup&quot;.

<text>The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) was a United States trade union of air traffic controllers that operated from 1968 until its decertification in 1981 following an illegal strike broken by the Reagan administration; in striking, the union violated 5 U.S.C. (Supp. III 1956) 118p (now ), which prohibits strikes by federal government employees.

==Beginnings==
PATCO was founded in 1968 with the assistance of attorney and pilot F. Lee Bailey. On July 3, 1968, PATCO announced &quot;Operation Air Safety&quot; in which all members were ordered to adhere strictly to the established separation standards for aircraft. The resultant large delay of air traffic was the first of many official and unofficial &quot;slowdowns&quot; that PATCO would initiate.

In 1969, the U.S. Civil Service Commission ruled that PATCO was no longer a professional association but in fact a trade union. On June 18–20, 1969, 477 controllers conducted a three-day sick-out.

On March 25, 1970, the newly designated union orchestrated a controller &quot;sickout&quot; to protest many of the FAA actions that they felt were unfair; over 2,000 controllers around the country did not report to work as scheduled and informed management that they were ill. Controllers called in sick to circumvent the federal law against strikes by government unions. Management personnel attempted to assume many of the duties of the missing controllers but major traffic delays around the country occurred. On April 16, the federal courts intervened and most controllers went back to work by order of the court, but the government was forced to the bargaining table. The sickout led officials to recognize that the ATC system was operating nearly at capacity. To alleviate some of this, Congress accelerated the installation of automated systems, reopened the air traffic controller training academy in Oklahoma City, began hiring air traffic controllers at an increasing rate, and raised salaries to help attract and retain controllers.

In the 1980 presidential election, PATCO (along with the Teamsters and the Air Line Pilots Association) refused to back President Jimmy Carter, instead endorsing Republican Party candidate Ronald Reagan. PATCO&#x27;s refusal to endorse the Democratic Party stemmed in large part from poor labor relations with the FAA (the employer of PATCO members) under the Carter administration and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s endorsement of the union and its struggle for better conditions during the 1980 election campaign.

During his campaign, Reagan sent a letter to Robert E. Poli, the new president of PATCO, in which he declared support for the organization&#x27;s demands and a disposition to work toward solutions. In it, he stated &quot;I will take whatever steps are necessary to provide our air traffic controllers with the most modern equipment available, and to adjust staff levels and workdays so they are commensurate with achieving the maximum degree of public safety,&quot; and &quot;I pledge to you that my administration will work very closely with you to bring about a spirit of cooperation between the President and the air traffic controllers.&quot; This letter gave Poli and the organization a sense of security that led to an overestimation of their position in the negotiations with the FAA, which contributed to their decision to strike.

==August 1981 strike==


In February 1981, PATCO and the FAA began new contract negotiations. Citing safety concerns, PATCO called for a reduced 32-hour work week, a $10,000 pay increase for all air-traffic controllers and a better benefits package for retirement. Negotiations quickly stalled. Then, in June, the FAA offered a new three-year contract with $105 million of up front conversions in raises to be paid in 11.4% increases over the next three years, a raise more than twice what was being given to other federal employees, &quot;The average federal controller (at a GS-13 level, a common grade controller) earned $36,613, which was 18% less than private sector counterpart&quot;; with the raise demanded, the average federal pay would have exceeded the private sector pay by 8%, along with better benefits and shorter working hours. However, because the offer did not include a shorter work week or earlier retirement, PATCO rejected the offer.

At 7 a.m. on August 3, 1981, the union declared a strike, seeking better working conditions, better pay (PATCO sought a total raise of $600 million over three years, compared to FAA&#x27;s offer of $105 million) and a 32-hour workweek (a four-day week and an eight-hour day combined). In addition, PATCO wanted to be excluded from the civil service clauses that it had long disliked. In striking, the union violated 5 U.S.C. (Supp. III 1956) 118p (now ), which prohibits strikes by federal government employees. Anthony Skirlick of the Los Angeles Center warned that these &quot;Unrealistic demands in the face of this change is suicide&quot;. Despite supporting PATCO&#x27;s effort in his 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan declared the PATCO strike a &quot;peril to national safety&quot; and ordered them back to work under the terms of the Taft–Hartley Act. Only 1,300 (10%) of the nearly 13,000 controllers returned to work. At 10:55 a.m., Reagan included the following in a statement: &quot;Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, a sworn affidavit, when they accepted their jobs: &#x27;I am not participating in any strike against the Government of the United States or any agency thereof, and I will not so participate while an employee of the Government of the United States or any agency thereof.&#x27;&quot; He then demanded those remaining on strike return to work within 48 hours or officially forfeit their positions.

After PATCO disobeyed a federal court injunction ordering an end to the strike and return to work, a federal judge found union leaders including PATCO President Robert Poli to be in contempt of court, and the union was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine, and certain named members were ordered to pay a $1,000 fine for each day its members were on strike. At the same time, Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis organized for replacements and started contingency plans. By prioritizing and cutting flights severely (about 7,000), and even adopting methods of air traffic management that PATCO had previously lobbied for, the government was initially able to have 50% of flights available.

On August 5, following the PATCO workers&#x27; refusal to return to work, the Reagan administration fired the 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, and banned them from federal service for life. In the wake of the strike and mass firings, the FAA was faced with the difficult task of hiring and training enough controllers to replace those that had been fired. Under normal conditions, it took three years to train new controllers. Until replacements could be trained, the vacant positions were temporarily filled with a mix of non-participating controllers, supervisors, staff personnel, some non-rated personnel, military controllers, and controllers transferred temporarily from other facilities. PATCO was decertified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority on October 22, 1981. The decision was appealed but to no avail, and attempts to use the courts to reverse the firings proved fruitless.

The FAA had initially claimed that staffing levels would be restored within two years; however, it took closer to 10 years before the overall staffing levels returned to normal.

Some former striking controllers were allowed to reapply after 1986 and were rehired; they and their replacements are now represented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which was certified on June 19, 1987, and had no connection with PATCO. The civil service ban on the remaining strike participants was lifted by President Bill Clinton on August 12, 1993. Nevertheless, by 2006 only 850 PATCO strikers had been rehired by the FAA.

==Legacy==
Reagan&#x27;s firing of the government employees encouraged large private employers like Phelps Dodge (1983), Hormel (1985–86), and International Paper (1987) to hire striker replacements instead of negotiating in labor conflicts. In 1970 there were over 380 major strikes or lockouts in the U.S.; by 1980 the number had dropped to under 200, in 1999 it fell to 17, and in 2010 there were only 11.

In 2003, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking on the legacy of Ronald Reagan, noted:
Reagan&#x27;s director of the United States Office of Personnel Management at the time, Donald J. Devine, argued:
In a review of Joseph McCartin&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;Collision Course: Ronald Reagan, The Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike that Changed America&quot; in Review 31, Richard Sharpe stated that Reagan was &quot;laying down a marker&quot; for his presidency: &quot;The strikers were often working-class men and women who had achieved suburban middle class lives as air traffic controllers without having gone to college. Many were veterans of the US armed forces where they had learned their skills; their union had backed Reagan in his election campaign. Nevertheless, Reagan refused to back down. Several strikers were jailed; the union was fined and eventually made bankrupt. Only about 800 got their jobs back when Clinton lifted the ban on rehiring those who went on strike. Many of the strikers were forced into poverty as a result of being blacklisted for [U.S. government] employment.&quot;

Paul Volcker called the strike a &quot;watershed&quot; moment in the fight against inflation:
==Other ATC organizations==
In addition to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, two organizations now claim the name and part or all of the jurisdiction of the original PATCO: Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (AFSCME) and Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization.

<doc id="762768" wikidata="Q203309" url="?curid=762768" title="Vesoul">
<text>Vesoul ( ) is a commune in the predominantly rural Haute-Saône department, of which it is the prefecture, or capital, in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté located in eastern France.

It is the most populated municipality of the department, with inhabitants in 2014. The same year, the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération de Vesoul, which covers 20 municipalities, together had inhabitants, while its urban area, comprising 78 municipalities, had inhabitants. Its inhabitants are known in French as &quot;Vésuliens&quot;.

Built on top of the hill of La Motte in the first millennium under the name of &quot;Castrum Vesulium&quot;, the city gradually evolved into a European commercial and economic center. At the end of the Middle Ages, the city experienced a challenging period beset with plagues, epidemics, and localized conflict.

The main urban center of the department, Vesoul is also home to a major PSA parts manufacturing plant and to the Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema. It was immortalized by Jacques Brel in his 1968 song &quot;Vesoul&quot;.

==History==
Vesoul is first mentioned in a document dated 899. That document describes an elevation with a fortified watchtower and speaks of &quot;Castrum Vesulium&quot;. Castrum is a fortification, and &quot;Vesulium&quot; has the syllable &quot;ves&quot; which meant hill or mountain in a language that was spoken before the Celts. Today, there is a castle that forms the centre of the city. The first houses were built inside the walls of the castle. Newcomers who found no place settled outside the city walls, on the flanks of the hill. Growing wine was popular.

The town was severely affected by the plague in 1586. It became part of France in 1678.

In 1814, after the fall of the empire, a buffer state was created, with Vesoul as capital. The principality was that of Free County, of the Vosges and of Porrentruy.

Today, one of the main factories of PSA Peugeot Citroën is near Vesoul.

==Geography==

Vesoul is located in the eastern part of France, about 100 kilometers away from the Germany and the Switzerland border and between the Jura and the Vosges&#x27;s mountain ranges. Vesoul is also situated in the center of the Haute-Saône, which is in the north of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. In of this region, Vesoul is included in the &quot;Pays de Vesoul et du Val de Saône&quot;, a geographic region composed of the Vesoul&#x27;s area and the northern part of the river Saône.

By road, Vesoul is from Luxeuil-les-Bains, from Lure and from Gray, which are the main towns close to Vesoul. Relative to the bigger cities in the French East region, Vesoul is located from Besançon, from Belfort, from Dijon, and from Nancy. Equidistant from Dijon and Mulhouse, Vesoul is away from the city of Paris. The town of Vesoul is at the intersection of national roads N19 and N57. Vesoul station is on the SNCF Paris–Mulhouse railway line, and has connections with Paris, Belfort, Mulhouse and Chaumont.

The Vesoul area is also included in the &quot;Pôle métropolitain Centre Franche-Comté&quot; which is a government structure unifying the biggest areas of central Franche-Comté. Nine communes border the town of Vesoul.

Vesoul is crossed by four watercourses : two rivers (Durgeon and Colombine) and two streams (Vaugine and Méline). All four are tributaries and sub-tributaries of the Saône, the fourth longest river in France at 473 kilometers long and a tributary of the Rhone, which flows at about ten kilometers from the western side of Vesoul.

=== Library ===
The first public library of Vesoul opened in 1771. The &quot;abbé&quot; (abbot) Bardenet, superior of the Saint-Esprit hospital in Besançon, gave his book collection to the town. There were 1772 books. The collections became a lot larger with the Revolution. At that time, the revolutionaries (people who led the French Revolution) took the books from the monasteries of the town (&quot;capucins&quot;) and even of the region (&quot;Luxeuil&quot; and &quot;Faverney&quot; monasteries). Around 20,000 books were added to the library this way, including some 11th century manuscripts. The Mayor&#x27;s office was responsible for keeping the books.

In 1981, the municipality decided to build a new building to encourage the public to read. The library was recently equipped with computers. There are around 200 manuscripts and 150 incunables.

<doc id="762770" wikidata="Q329618" url="?curid=762770" title="German colonial empire">
<text>The German colonial empire () constituted the overseas colonies, dependencies, and territories of the German Empire. Unified in 1871, the chancellor of this time period was Otto von Bismarck. Short-lived attempts at colonization by individual German states had occurred in preceding centuries, but Bismarck resisted pressure to construct a colonial empire until the Scramble for Africa in 1884. Claiming much of the remaining uncolonized areas of Africa, Germany built the third-largest colonial empire at the time, after the British and French. The German colonial empire encompassed parts of Africa and Oceania. 

Germany lost control of most of its colonial empire at the beginning of the First World War in 1914, but some German forces held out in German East Africa until the end of the war. After the German defeat in World, Germany&#x27;s colonial empire was officially confiscated as part of the Treaty of Versailles between the Allies and German Weimar Republic. Each colony became a League of Nations mandate under the administration, although not sovereignty, of one of the Allied powers. Talk of regaining the colonies persisted in Germany until 1943, but never became an official goal of the German government.

==Origins==
Germans had traditions of foreign sea-borne trade dating back to the Hanseatic League; German emigrants had flowed eastward in the direction of the Baltic littoral, Russia and Transylvania and westward to the Americas; and North German merchants and missionaries showed interest in overseas engagements. The Hanseatic republics of Hamburg and Bremen sent traders across the globe. Their trading houses conducted themselves as successful &quot;Privatkolonisatoren&quot; [independent colonizers], concluding treaties and land purchases in Africa and the Pacific with chiefs and/or other tribal leaders. These early agreements with local entities later formed the basis for annexation treaties, diplomatic support, and military protection by the German government.

However, until their 1871 unification, the German states had not concentrated on the development of a navy, and this essentially had precluded German participation in earlier imperialist scrambles for remote colonial territory. Without a blue-water navy, a would-be colonial power could not reliably defend, supply, or trade with overseas dependencies. The German states before 1870 had retained separate political structures and goals, and German foreign policy up to and including the age of Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898; in office as Prussian Foreign Minister from 1862 to 1890) concentrated on resolving the &quot;German question&quot; in Europe and on securing German interests on the continent. However, by 1891 the Germans were mostly united under Prussian rule. They also sought a more clear-cut &quot;German&quot; state, and saw colonies as a good way to achieve that.

=== German Confederation and the Zollverein ===
In the states of the German Confederation founded in 1815 and the Zollverein established in 1834, there was some call from private and economic interests for the establishment of German colonies, especially in the 1840s. However, governments had no such aspirations. In 1839, private interests founded the , which sought to purchase the Chatham Islands east of New Zealand and settle German emigrants there, but Great Britain had a preexisting claim to the island. Hamburg relied on the Royal Navy for its worldwide shipping interests and therefore gave no political support to the Colonial Society. The Society for the Protection of German Immigrants to Texas, established in Mainz in 1842, sought to expand the German settlements into a colony of &quot;New Germany&quot; (). About 7400 settlers were involved. The venture proved a complete failure. There was a constant lack of supplies and land and around half of the colonists died. The plan was definitively ended with the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845.

Starting in the 1850s German commercial enterprises spread into areas that would later become German colonies in West Africa, East Africa, the Samoan Islands, the unexplored north-east quarter of New Guinea with its adjacent islands, the Douala delta in Cameroon, and the mainland coast across from Zanzibar.

=== First state-sponsored colonial venture (1857–1862) ===
In 1857, the Austrian frigate &quot;Novara&quot; departed from Triest on the Novara Expedition, which aimed to explore and take possession of the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. The &quot;Novara&quot; arrived at the Nicobars in 1858, but the Austrians did not subsequently claim the islands.

The next state-sponsored attempt to acquire a colony occurred in 1859, when Prussia attempted to claim the island of Formosa (modern Taiwan). Prussia had already sought the approval of the French Emperor Napoleon III for the undertaking since France was also seeking to acquire colonies in East Asia at that time. Since French interests focused on Vietnam, not Formosa, Prussia could seek to acquire the island. A Prussian naval expedition, which departed Germany at the end of 1859, was tasked with concluding trade treaties in Asia for Prussia and the other states of the Zollverein and with occupying Formosa. However, this task was not carried out, due to the limited strength of the expedition forces and because they did not wish to preclude a trade treaty with Qing China. In a cabinet order of 6 January 1862, the expedition&#x27;s ambassador, Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg was &quot;released from carrying out the part of his task concerned with the identification of overseas settlements suitable for Prussian settlement.&quot;

Despite this, one ship from the expedition, the &quot;Thetis&quot; was sent to Patagonia in South America to investigate its prospects as a colony, since the Prussian naval command in particular were interested in the establishment of a naval strong point on the South American coast. The &quot;Thetis&quot; had already reached Buenos Aires and the commander of the ship decided to return to Germany due to the exhaustion of the men after the year-long expedition and the need for repairs to the ship.

=== Bismarck&#x27;s rejection of colonization (1862–1871) ===

After the Second Schleswig War in 1864, colonialist societies in Prussia aspired to take possession of the Nicobar Islands which had previously been in Danish possession. For its part, Denmark unsuccessfully proposed to exchange the Danish West Indies for some of the lost territory in Schleswig in 1865. In 1866 and then again in 1876, Jamal ul-Azam, Sultan of the Sulu Islands, located between Borneo and the Philippines, offered to place his islands under Prussian and then Imperial German control, but both times he was rebuffed. Ahmad ibn Fumo Bakari, the Sultan of Wituland asked the Prussian traveler to establish a Prussian protectorate over his lands, but this request was never considered in Berlin.

In the 1867 constitution of the North German Confederation, article 4.1 declared &quot;colonization&quot; as one of the areas under the &quot;oversight of the Confederation&quot;, which remained the case in the Imperial constitution established in 1871.

In 1867/8, Otto von Bismarck dispatched the screw corvette to the Caribbean to show the flag of the North German Confederation. At the personal urging of Prince Adalbert, the commander of the North German Federal Navy, and without Bismarck&#x27;s knowledge, the commander of the &quot;Augusta&quot;, conducted negotiations with José María Castro Madriz, President of Costa Rica with a view to establishing a naval base at Puerto Limón. Bismarck rejected the acquisition, due to the American Monroe Doctrine. This desire to avoid antagonising the United States also led him to reject a Dutch offer to establish a naval base on the Dutch island of Curaçao.

In 1868, Bismarck made his opposition to any colonial acquisitions clear in a letter to the Prussian Minister of War Albrecht von Roon:

He also repeatedly stated &quot;... I am no man for colonies&quot; 
The policy of the North German Confederation at this time focussed on the acquisition of individual naval bases, not colonies. With these it would be able to use gunboat diplomacy to protect the global trade interests of the Confederation through a kind of informal imperialism. In 1867, it was decided to establish five overseas bases. Accordingly, in 1868, land was bought in Yokohama in Japan for a German naval hospital, which remained in operation until 1911. In 1869 the &quot;East Asian Station&quot; (&quot;Ostasiatische Station&quot;) was established there by the navy as the first overseas base, with a permanent presence of German warships. Until the German Empire&#x27;s acquisition of Qingdao in China as a military port in 1897, Yokohama remained the base of the German fleet in East Asia. It later proved useful following the acquisition of colonies in the Pacific and in Kiaochow.

In 1869, the Rhenish Missionary Society, which had been established in southwestern Africa for several decades asked King William of Prussia for protection and suggested the establishment of a naval station at Walvis Bay. William was very interested in this suggestion, but the matter was forgotten following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.

===Debate and tentative steps under the new German Empire (1871–1878)===

A French proposal after the Franco-Prussian War to hand over the French colony of Cochinchina instead of Alsace–Lorraine, was rejected by Bismarck and a majority of the delegates in the North German Reichstag in 1870. After German Unification in 1871, Bismarck maintained his earlier position. During the 1870s, colonialist propaganda achieved increasing public profile in Germany. In 1873, the was established, which considered exploration of Africa its main function. In 1878 the foundation of the was established, which sought to acquire colonies for Germany, and in 1881 was founded, which included the &quot;acquisition of agricultural and commercial colonies for the German Empire&quot; in its founding statute. In 1882, the first was established, which was a lobby group for colonialist propaganda. In 1887, the competing Society for German Colonization was established with the goal of actually undertaking colonization. The two societies merged in 1887 into the German Colonial Society. Generally, four arguments were advanced in favor of the acquisition of colonies:
* Once developed, colonies would offer captive markets for German industrial products and thus provide a substitute for the decreasing consumer demand in Germany following the Panic of 1873.
* Colonies would provide a space for the German diaspora, so that they would not be lost to the nation. Since the diaspora had mainly emigrated to English-speaking areas up to this point, the prominent colonialist held that if they were allowed to leave, the Anglo-Saxon race would irretrievably overtake the German one demographically.
* Germany had, as the theologian put it, a &quot;cultural mission&quot; to spread its supposedly superior culture across the globe.
* The acquisition of colonies provided a possible solution for the Social Question – workers would commit themselves to an absorbing national task and abandon social democracy. Through this and through the emigration of the overly rebellious masses to the colonies the internal unity of the nation would be strengthened.

Moreover, German public opinion in the late-19th century viewed colonial acquisitions as a true indication of having achieved full nationhood, and eventually arrived at an understanding that prestigious African and Pacific colonies went hand-in-hand with dreams of a High Seas Fleet.

Bismarck remained opposed to these arguments and preferred an informal commercial imperialism, in which German companies carried out profitable trade with areas outside Europe and made economic inroads without the occupation of territories or the construction of states. Bismarck and many deputies in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; had no interest in making colonial conquests merely to acquire square miles of territory.

As a result, the first colonial enterprises abroad were extremely hesitant: a was signed in 1876, which provided for the establishment of a coal station on the Tongan island of Vavaʻu, guaranteeing all usage rights of the specified area to the German Empire, but leaving the King of Tonga&#x27;s sovereignty untouched. No actual colonization occurred. On 16 July 1878, the commander of the screw corvette , occupied Falealili and Saluafata on the Samoan island of Upolu &quot;in the name of the Empire&quot;. The German occupation of these places was revoked in January 1879 with the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between the local rulers and Germany. On 19 November 1878, von Werner established a treaty with the leaders of Jaluit Atoll and the Ralik islands of Lebon and Letahalin, granting privileges like the exclusive right to establish a coal station. An official German colony in the Marshall Islands was only established in 1885. Von Werner also acquired a harbor on the islands of Makada and Mioko in the Duke of York Islands in December 1878, which would become a component part of the future protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. On 20 April 1879, the commander of the screw corvette , and the German Consul for the South Seas Islands, Gustav Godeffroy Junior established a treaty of commerce and friendship with &quot;the government&quot; of Huahine, one of the Society Islands, which granted the German fleet the right to anchor at all harbors on the island, among other things.

==Establishment of the empire (1884–1890)==

Although Bismarck &quot;remained as contemptuous of all colonial dreams as ever&quot;, in 1884, he consented to the acquisition of colonies by the German Empire, in order to protect trade, safeguard raw materials and export-markets and to take advantage of opportunities for capital investment, among other reasons. In the very next year Bismarck shed personal involvement when &quot;he abandoned his colonial drive as suddenly and casually as he had started it&quot; – as if he had committed an error in judgment that could confuse the substance of his more significant policies. &quot;Indeed, in 1889, [Bismarck] tried to give German South West Africa away to the British. It was, he said, a burden and an expense, and he would like to saddle someone else with it.&quot;

Following 1884, Germany invaded several territories in Africa: German East Africa (including present-day Burundi, Rwanda, and the mainland part of Tanzania); German South West Africa (present-day Namibia), German Cameroon (including parts of present-day Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria); and Togoland (present-day Togo and parts of Ghana). Germany was also active in the Pacific, annexing a series of islands that would be called German New Guinea (part of present-day Papua New Guinea and several nearby island groups). The northeastern region of the island of New Guinea was called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland; the Bismarck Archipelago to the islands&#x27; east also contained two larger islands named New Mecklenburg and New Pomerania. They also acquired the Northern Solomon Islands. These islands were given the status of protectorate.

=== Bismarck moves towards a colonial policy (1878–1883)===
The shift in Bismarck&#x27;s policy on the acquisition of colonies began as part of his 1878 policy on the protection of the German economy from foreign competition. The beginning of his colonial policy in connection with the Schutzzollpolitik was the acquisition of Samoa, where there were significant German economic interests. In June 1879, as Imperial Chancellor, he acknowledged the &quot;Treaty of Friendship&quot; agreed between the Samoan chiefs and the German consul in Samoa in January 1879, with the result that the consul assumed control of the administration of the city of Apia on the island of Upolu, along with the consuls of Britain and America. In the 1880s, Bismarck would unsuccessfully attempt to annex Samoa several times. The western Samoan islands, which included Apia, the main city, became a German colony in 1899.

In April 1880, Bismarck actively intervened in domestic politics in favor of colonial matters, when he presented the Samoa Bill to the Reichstag. It had been endorsed by the Federal Council, but was rejected by the Reichstag. The bill would have provided German financial support to a private German colonial trade company that had fallen into difficulties.

In May 1880, Bismarck asked the banker Adolph von Hansemann to produce a report on German colonial goals in the Pacific and the possibility of enforcing them. Hansemann submitted his &quot;Memorandum on Colonial Aspirations in the South Seas&quot; to Bismarck in September of the same year. The proposed territorial acquisitions were almost all taken or claimed as colonies four years later. Those Pacific territories that were claimed in 1884 but not taken were finally brought under German colonial administration in 1899. Significantly, Hausemann was a founding member of the New Guinea Consortium for the acquisition of colonies in New Guinea and the Pacific in 1882.

In November 1882, the Bremen-based tobacco merchant Adolf Lüderitz contacted the Foreign Office and requested protection for a trade station south of Walvis Bay on the southwest African coast. In February and November 1883, he asked the British government whether the United Kingdom would provide protection to Lüderitz&#x27;s trade station. Both times the British government refused.

From March 1883, Adolph Woermann, a Hamburg bulkgoods trader, shipowner, and member of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, engaged in extremely confidential negotiations with the Foreign Office, which was headed by Bismarck, for the acquisition of a colony in West Africa. The reason for this was the fear of tariffs that Hamburg traders might have to pay if the whole of West Africa were to come under British or French control. Finally, a secret request from the Chamber of Commerce to Bismarck for the establishment of a colony in West Africa was submitted on 6 July 1883, stating that &quot;through such acquisitions, German trade in Trans-Atlantic lands could only be given a firmer position and a surer support, while without political protection trade cannot now thrive and progress.&quot;

After this, in March 1883, the Sierra Leone Convention between the United Kingdom and France was published, in which the two countries&#x27; spheres of interest were laid out without consideration of other trading nations. In response the German government asked the senates of the cities of Lübeck, Bremen, and Hamburg for their opinions. In their answer, the Hamburg merchants demanded the acquisition of colonies in West Africa. In December 1883, Bismarck let Hamburg known that an Imperial commissioner would be sent to West Africa to secure the safety of German trade and to conclude a treaty with &quot;independent Negro states&quot;. The screw corvette would be sent to provide military protection. Additionally, Bismarck requested suggestions on this plan and asked for Adolph Woermann&#x27;s advice personally on what instructions should be given to the Imperial commissioner. In March 1884, Gustav Nachtigal was named as the Imperial Commissioner for the West African Coast and set sail for West Africa in the gunboat .

=== Colonization under Bismarck (1884–1888)===

The year 1884 marks the beginning of actual German colonial acquisitions, building on the overseas possessions and rights that had been acquired for the German Empire since 1876. In one year, Germany&#x27;s holdings became the third-largest colonial empire, after the British and French empires. Following the British model, Bismarck placed many possessions of German merchants under the protection of the German empire. He took advantage of a period of foreign peace to begin the &quot;colonial experiment&quot;, which he remained skeptical of. The transition to official acceptance of colonialism and to colonial government thus occurred during the last quarter of Bismarck&#x27;s tenure of office.

First, Adolf Lüderitz&#x27;s trading post in the Bay of Angara Pequena (&#x27;Lüderitz Bay&#x27;) and the surrounding hinterland (&quot;) was placed under the protection of the German Empire in April 1884 as German South West Africa. In July, Togoland and Adolph Woermann&#x27;s possessions in Cameroon followed, then the northeastern section of New Guinea (&#x27;Kaiser-Wilhelmsland&#x27;) and the neighboring islands (&#x27;the Bismarck Archipelago&#x27;). In January 1885, the German flag was raised at Kapitaï and Koba on the west African coast. In February, imperialist and &quot;man-of-action&quot; Carl Peters accumulated vast tracts of land for his Society for German Colonization, &quot;emerging from the bush with X-marks [affixed by unlettered tribal chiefs] on documents ... for some of the Zanzibar Sultanate&#x27;s mainland property.&quot; which became German East Africa. Such exploratory missions required security measures that could be solved with small private, armed contingents recruited mainly in the Sudan and usually led by adventurous former military personnel of lower rank. Brutality, hanging and flogging prevailed during these land-grab expeditions under Peters&#x27; control as well as others as no-one &quot;held a monopoly in the mistreatment of Africans&quot;, and in April 1885, the brothers Clemens and Gustav Denhardt acquired Wituland in modern Kenya. With this, the first wave of German colonial acquisitions was largely completed.

The raising of German flags on Pacific islands claimed by Spain between August and October 1885 sparked the Carolines Crisis, in which Germany ultimately backed down.

In October 1885, the Marshall Islands were also claimed and finally several of the Solomon Islands in October 1886. In 1888, Germany ended the civil war on Nauru and annexed the island.

====Causes====
The causes of Bismarck&#x27;s sudden shift to a policy of colonial acquisition remain a matter of controversy among historians. There are two dominant schools of thought: one which focuses on German domestic politics and one which focuses on foreign affairs.

In terms of internal politics, the key aspect is the public pressure which led to the development of a &quot;Colonial fever&quot; (&quot;Kolonialfieber&quot;) among the German populace. Although the colonial movement was not very strong institutionally, it succeeded in bringing its position into the public debate. A memorandum authored by Adolph Woermann and sent to Bismarck by the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce on 6 July 1883 is considered to have been particularly important in this respect. The approach of the 1884 German federal election and Bismarck&#x27;s desire to strengthen his own position and bind the National Liberal Party, which supported colonialism, to himself, have also been proposed as domestic factors in the adoption of the colonial policy. Hans-Ulrich Wehler advanced the social imperialism thesis, which holds that the colonial expansion served to &quot;divert&quot; social tensions created by economic crisis to the foreign sphere and helped to reinforce Bismarck&#x27;s authority. The so-called &quot;Crown-prince thesis&quot; holds that Bismarck was attempting to deliberately worsen the German relationship with the United Kingdom before the anticipated succession of the &quot;anglophile&quot; Frederick III to the German throne in order to prevent him from instituting liberal English-style policies.

In terms of foreign policy, the decision to colonize is seen as an extension of the concept of the European balance of power to a global context. Participating in the Scramble for Africa would also reinforce its position as one of the Great Powers. Improving relations with France through a &quot;colonial entente&quot; that would divert French attention from revanchism related to Alsace-Lorraine, which had been annexed by Germany in 1871, has also been seen as a motive.

==== Company land acquisitions and stewardship====
It is no longer believed that the initiation of colonial expansion represented a radical reversal of Bismarck&#x27;s politics. The liberal-imperialist ideal of an overseas policy grounded in private economic initiatives, which he had held from the beginning, was not changed much by placing German merchants&#x27; possessions under the protection of the Empire.
As Bismarck was converted to the colonial idea by 1884, he favored &quot;chartered company&quot; land management rather than establishment of colonial government due to financial considerations. He used official letters of protection to transfer the commerce and administration of individual &quot;German protectorates&quot; to private companies. The administration of these areas was assigned to the German East Africa Company (1885–1890), the German Witu Company (1887–1890), the German New Guinea Company (1885–1899), and the Jaluit Company in the Marshall Islands (1888–1906). Bismarck would have liked the German colonies in west Africa and southwest Africa to be administered in this way as well, but neither the nor the Syndicate for West Africa were willing to take on the role.
These areas were brought into German possession with extremely unequal treaties following demonstrations of military power. Indigenous rulers ceded vast areas, which they often had no legal claim to, in exchange for vague promises of protection and laughably low purchase prices. Details of the treaties often remained unclear to them due to the language barrier. They engaged with these deals, however, because the long negotiations with the colonizers and the ritual act of signing a treaty enormously enhanced their authority. These treaties were approved by the German government, which granted complete authority without oversight to the colonial companies, while retaining for itself only ultimate sovereignty and a few unspecified rights to intervene. In this way, state financial and administrative engagement with the colonies was kept to a minimum.

However, this strategy failed within a few years. The poor financial situation of almost all of the &quot;protectorates&quot; as well as the precarious security situation (indigenous revolts broke out in South West Africa and East Africa in 1888, while in Cameroon and Togo border conflicts with the neighboring British colonies were feared, and in general the demands of efficient administration overwhelmed the colonial companies) compelled Bismarck and his successors to implement direct and formal rule in all the colonies.

Although temperate zone cultivation flourished, the demise and often failure of tropical low-land enterprises contributed to changing Bismarck&#x27;s view. He reluctantly acquiesced to pleas for help to deal with revolts and armed hostilities by often powerful rulers whose lucrative slaving activities seemed at risk. German native military forces initially engaged in dozens of punitive expeditions to apprehend and punish freedom fighters, at times with British assistance. The author Charles Miller offers the theory that the Germans had the handicap of trying to colonize African areas inhabited by aggressive tribes, whereas their colonial neighbors had more docile peoples to contend with. At that time, the German penchant for giving muscle priority over patience contributed to continued unrest. Several of the African colonies remained powder kegs throughout this phase (and beyond).

===Halt to colonial acquisitions (1888–1890)===
After 1885, Bismarck opposed further colonial acquisitions and maintained his policy focus on maintaining good relationships with the Great Powers of England and France. In 1888, when the journalist Eugen Wolf urged him to acquire further colonies for Germany, so that it would not fall behind in the scramble with the other Great Powers for colonies, which he understood in a social Darwinian sense, Bismarck replied that his priority was rather the protection of the recently won national unity, which he considered to be under threat due to Germany&#x27;s central location:
In 1889, Bismarck considered withdrawing Germany from colonial policy, wishing to entirely end Germany&#x27;s activities in East Africa and Samoa, according to eyewitnesses. It was further reported that Bismarck wanted nothing more to do with the administration of the colonies and intended to hand them over to the admiralty. In May 1889, Bismarck offered to sell the German possessions in Africa to the Italian Prime Minister, Francesco Crispi – who countered with an offer to sell Italy&#x27;s colonies to Germany.

Bismarck also found the colonies useful as bargaining chips. At the Congo Conference held in Berlin from 1884 to 1885, Africa was divided up between the Great Powers. In 1884, a treaty was concluded in the name of Lüderitz with the Zulu king Dinuzulu, which would have given Germany a claim to St Lucia Bay in Zululand. However, the claim was dropped as part of a concession to Britain in May 1885, along with a claim to Pondoland. Also in 1885, Germany waived its claim to the west African territories of Kapitaï and Koba and Mahinland, in favor of France and Britain respectively. In 1886, Germany and Britain agreed on the boundaries of their spheres of interest in East Africa.

After Bismarck had ended the policy of colonial acquisition in March 1890, he concluded the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty with Britain on 1 July 1890, in which Germany renounced all remaining claims north of German East Africa. In this way, he established a balance with Great Britain. Renouncing the German claims to the Somali coast between Burgabo and Alula also improved relations with Italy, one of Germany&#x27;s partners in the Triple Alliance. In exchange for this, Germany acquired the Caprivi Strip, which extended German South West Africa east to the Zambezi River (it was hoped that the river would enable overland transport between German South West Africa and German East Africa). In these circumstances, further German colonial aspirations in South East Africa were brought to an end.

German interest in African colonies was accompanied by a growth of scholarly interest in Africa. In 1845, the orientalist Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer of Leipzig University and others founded the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft. The linguist Hans Stumme, also of Leipzig, researched African languages. Leipzig established a professorship of Anthropology, Ethnography, and Pre-history in 1901 (Karl Weule, who established an ethnological and biological determinist school of African research) and a professorship for &quot;Colonial geography and colonial policy&quot; in 1915. The researcher Hans Meyer was director of the &quot;Institute for Colonial Geography&quot;. In 1919, the Seminar for Colonial geography and colonial policy&quot; was established.

== The empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II (1890–1914)==
Kaiser Wilhelm II (1888–1918) was keen for Germany to expand its colonial holdings. Bismarck&#x27;s immediate successor in 1890, Leo von Caprivi, was willing to maintain the colonial burden of what already existed, but opposed new ventures. Others who followed, especially Bernhard von Bülow, as foreign minister and chancellor, sanctioned the acquisition of further Pacific Ocean colonies and provided substantial treasury assistance to existing protectorates to employ administrators, commercial agents, surveyors, local &quot;peacekeepers&quot; and tax collectors. This accorded with the expansionistic policy and a forced upgrade of the Imperial German Navy. Colonial acquisition became a serious factor in German domestic politics. The German colonial society was joined in 1891 by the extremely nationalistic Pan-German League. In addition to the arguments previously made in support of colonialism, it was now argued that Germany had a duty to end the slave trade in the colonies and free indigenous people from their Muslim enslavers. These abolitionist demands, with their clear anti-Muslim bias turned the 1888 &quot;Arab revolt&quot; on the East African coast into a holy war. Pre-eminent, however, was the matter of German national prestige and the belief that Germany was locked in a Social Darwinist competition with the other Great Powers, in which Germany as a &quot;late-comer&quot; had to claim her due share.

Wilhelm himself lamented his nation&#x27;s position as colonial followers rather than leaders. In an interview with Cecil Rhodes in March 1899 he stated the alleged dilemma clearly: &quot;... Germany has begun her colonial enterprise very late, and was, therefore, at the disadvantage of finding all the desirable places already occupied.&quot; Under the new Weltpolitik (&quot;Global policy&quot;), a &quot;place in the Sun&quot; was sought for the &quot;latecoming nation&quot; (as the chancellor Bernhard von Bülow put it in a speech to the Reichstag on 6 December 1897), which entailed the possession of colonies and a right to have a say in other colonial matters. This policy focussed on national prestige sharply contrasted with the pragmatic colonial policy advanced by Bismarck in 1884 and 1885.

===Acquisitions after 1890===

After 1890, Germany succeeded in acquiring only relatively minor territories. In 1895, concessions were acquired from Qing China in Hankau and Tientsin (modern Wuhan and Tianjin). Following the Juye Incident of 1 November 1897, in which two German missionaries from the Society of the Divine Word were murdered, Kaiser Wilhelm dispatched the East Asia Squadron to occupy Jiaozhou Bay and its chief port Qingdao on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula. This became the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory and the area within 50 km of Jiaozhou Bay became a &quot;Neutral Zone&quot; in which Chinese sovereignty was limited in favor of Germany. Furthermore, Germany received mining and railway concessions in Shandong province.

Through the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899, Germany acquired the Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, and Palau in Micronesia for 17 million gold marks. Through the Tripartite Convention of 1899, the west part of the Samoan islands became a German protectorate. Simultaneously, the control of existing colonies was extended inland; for example the kingdoms of Burundi and Rwanda were added to German East Africa. However, from 1891, German efforts in this regard encountered sharp resistance in the Bafut Wars in Cameroon and the conflict with the Hehe in East Africa.

On 6 March 1901, as part of preparatory work by the Imperial postal service for laying a German underwater telegraph cable, the colonial official took possession of Sonsorol island. The next day, he also claimed the islands of Merir and Pulo Anna, followed on 12 April by the island of Tobi and the Helen Reef. These islands were placed under the administration of German New Guinea.

In 1900, the Imperial Navy attempted to lease the island of Langkawi from the Sultan of Kedah for fifty years through the Behn Meyer company, based in Singapore. The deal fell through when the British government intervened based on a secret 1897 treaty with Siam which gave England the right to veto any Siamese concessions to a third power, so Kedah, which was a vassal of the Bangkok government, was prevented from loaning Langkawi to the German government. The Kaiser&#x27;s attempt to acquire the Baja California peninsula from Mexico as another naval base for the German fleet in the Pacific also failed.

During the Agadir Crisis in 1911, the German government attempted to get the whole of French Congo as compensation for German recognition of the French protectorate in Morocco. In the end they were given parts of northwestern French Congo, which were added to German Cameroon and dubbed Neukamerun. This acquisitive German colonial policy led to the increasing isolation of Germany among the Great Powers, seen in Germany as an &quot;encirclement&quot;.

For the academic development of the colonies, the was established in 1896. In 1898, the was established in Witzenhausen, to provide agricultural training to people for settlement in the colonies. It is now part of the University of Kassel. In 1900, the Institute for Naval and Tropical Medicine was established in Hamburg to train naval and colonial doctors.

Of the German colonies, only Togoland and German Samoa became profitable and self-sufficient; the balance sheet for the colonies as a whole revealed a fiscal net loss for Germany. Despite this, the leadership in Berlin committed the nation to the financial support, maintenance, development and defense of these possessions.

=== Anticolonial Resistance (1897–1905) ===

The forcefulness with which the German colonial rulers imposed their claim to control led to ever more revolts by the indigenous population. The native population was forced into unequal treaties by the German colonial governments. This led to the local tribes and natives losing their influence and power and eventually forced some of them to become slave laborers. The result was several military and genocidal campaigns by the Germans against the natives. Both the colonial authorities and settlers were of the opinion that native Africans were to be a lower class, their land seized and handed over to settlers and companies, while the remaining population was to be put in reservations; the Germans planned to make a colony inhabited predominantly by whites: a &quot;new African Germany&quot;.

Since the Germans were materially and technologically superior but had only a minimal military presence, the indigenous peoples largely adopted guerrilla tactics. The German colonial forces reacted similarly to other cases of asymmetric warfare involving colonial powers: they waged war against the whole population. In a scorched earth strategy, they destroyed villages, prevented economic activity, and withheld any protection against wild animals. Through these actions, they forced the population to flee into inhospitable regions, where many starved to death. Through this conscious strategy, the Germans caused lasting changes to the whole landscape, making it uninhabitable for decades.

The most significant of these actions against local populations were reprisals against the Chinese following the Boxer Rebellion in 1901–1902, the Herero and Namaqua genocide in 1904–1905, and the suppression of the Maji Maji Rebellion in 1905–1907.
After the outbreak of a cattle disease in South West Africa in 1897, the Herero spread their surviving cattle out over the area of the colony. However, these new pastures had been bought by settlers, who now claimed the Herero&#x27;s cattle for themselves. In 1904, the situation finally escalated into the revolt of the Herero and the Nama, which the understaffed Imperial Schutztruppe for German South West Africa were not able to quell. The German government therefore dispatched a naval expeditionary force and subsequently reinforcement Schutztruppe. In total, around 15,000 men under Lieutenant-general Lothar von Trotha defeated the Herero forces in August 1904 at the Battle of Waterberg. Von Trotha issued the so-called &quot;extermination order&quot; (&quot;Vernichtungsbefehl&quot;), under which the surviving Herero were driven into the wilderness. 1800 of the survivors had reached British Bechuanaland by the end of November 1904, while thousands more fled to the northernmost parts of South West Africa, and into the desert. The Herero population is estimated at 50,000, of which around half had died by 1908. The Nama suffered 10,000 deaths, also around half of their population. They had fought on the German side against the Herero until the end of 1904. This was the first genocide of the 20th century.

The Maji-Maji rebellion broke out in German East Africa in 1905/6 and its suppression led to an estimated 100,000 native deaths, many from famine resulting from German scorched earth tactics.

The lack of any true war in Togoland led some in Europe to call it Germany&#x27;s &quot;model colony.&quot; But it saw its own share of bloodshed. The Germans used forced labor and harsh punishment to keep the Africans in line.

To minimize dissent the German Colonial Press Law (written 1906–1912) kept the pugnacious settler press under control with censorship and prohibition of unauthorized publications. However, in Togoland, African writers avoided the law by publishing critical articles in the adjacent British Gold Coast Colony. In the process they built an international network of sympathizers. Exposés followed in the print media throughout Germany of the Herero rebellions in 1904 in German South West Africa (Namibia today) where in military interventions between 50% and 70% of the Herero population perished, known as the Herero and Namaqua Genocide. The subduing of the Maji Maji uprising in German East Africa in 1905 was prominently published. The rejection of a supplementary budget to provide further funding for colonial conflicts at the end of 1906 led to the dissolution of the Reichstag and new elections. &quot;A wave of anti-colonial feeling began to gather momentum in Germany&quot; and resulted in large voter turnouts in the so-called &quot;Hottentot election&quot; for the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in January 1907. The conservative Bülow government barely survived, but in January 1907 the newly-elected &quot;Reichstag&quot; imposed a &quot;complete overhaul&quot; upon the colonial service.

=== New colonial policies (1905–1914) ===
As a result of the colonial wars in South West Africa and East Africa, which had been caused by poor treatment of native peoples, it was considered necessary to change the German colonial administration, in favor of a more scientific approach to the employment of the colonies that improved the lives of the people in them. Therefore, the highest authority in colonial administration, the Colonial Department (&quot;Kolonialabteilung&quot;) was separated from the Foreign Office and, in May 1907, it became its own ministry, the Imperial Colonial Office (&quot;Reichskolonialamt&quot;).

The creator of the new colonial policy was a successful banker and private-sector restructurer, Bernhard Dernburg from Darmstadt, who was placed in charge of the Colonial Department in September 1906 and retained the role as Secretary of State of the revamped Colonial Office until 1910. Entrenched incompetents were screened out and summarily removed from office and &quot;not a few had to stand trial. Replacing the misfits was a new breed of efficient, humane, colonial civil servant, usually the product of Dernburg&#x27;s own creation, the ... Colonial Institute at Hamburg.&quot; In African protectorates, especially Togoland and German East Africa, &quot;improbably advanced and humane administrations emerged.&quot; Dernburg went on tours of the colonies, to learn about their problems first-hand and find solutions. Capital investments by banks were secured with public funds of the imperial treasury to minimize risk. Dernburg, as a former banker, facilitated such thinking; he saw his commission to also turn the colonies into paying propositions. He oversaw large-scale expansion of infrastructure. Every African protectorate built rail lines to the interior. Dar es Salaam evolved into &quot;the showcase city of all of tropical Africa,&quot; Lomé grew into the &quot;prettiest city in western Africa&quot;, and Qingdao in China was, &quot;in miniature, as German a city as Hamburg or Bremen&quot;. Whatever the Germans constructed in their colonies was made to last. Scientific and technical institutions for colonial purposes were established or expanded, in order to develop the colonies on these terms. Two of these, the Hamburg Colonial Institute and the German Colonial School are predecessor organizations of the modern universities of Hamburg and Kassel.

Dernburg declared that the indigenous population in the protectorates &quot;was the most important factor in our colonies&quot; and this was affirmed by new laws and initiatives. Corporal punishment was abolished. Every colony in Africa and the Pacific established the beginnings of a public school system, and every colony built and staffed hospitals. In some colonies, native agricultural holdings were encouraged and supported. In January 1909, Derburg said &quot;The goal must be colonies closely bound to the Fatherland, administratively independent, intellectually self-sufficient, and healthy.&quot;

Wilhelm Solf, who was Colonial Secretary from 1911 until 1918, also undertook tours in Africa in 1912 and 1913. The resulting impressions informed his colonial plans, which included an expansion of the powers of the governors and a ban on forced labor for Africans. As governor of Samoa, he had referred to the islanders as &quot;unsere braunen Schützlinge&quot; (our brown charges), who could be guided but not forced. Similarly, Heinrich Schnee, governor of East Africa from 1912, proclaimed that &quot;the dominant feature of my administration [will be] ... the welfare of the natives entrusted into my care.&quot; Solf also advocated a network of motorways in the colonies. He secured support for this comparatively peaceful colonial policy, instead of the highly militarized approach that had been taken up to this point, from all parties in the Reichstag, except for the right.

There were no further major revolts in the German colonies after 1905 and the economic efficiency of the overseas possessions rapidly increased, as a result of these new policies and improvements in shipping, especially the establishment of scheduled services with refrigerated holds, increased the amount of agricultural products from the colonies, exotic fruits and spices, that were sold to the public in Germany. Between 1906 and 1914, the production of palm oil and cocoa in the colonies doubled, the rubber production of the African colonies quadrupled, and the cotton exports from German East Africa increased tenfold. The total trade between Germany and its colonies increased from 72 million marks in 1906 to 264 million marks in 1913. Due to this economic growth, the income from colonial taxes and duties increased sixfold. Instead of being dependent on financial support from Germany, the colonies became or were on track to become financially independent. By 1914, only German New Guinea, Kiautschou, and the African Schutztruppen were subsidized. &quot;The colonial economy was thriving ... and roads, railways, shipping and telegraph communications were up to the minute.&quot;

The colonies were romanticized. Geologists and cartographers explored what were then unmarked regions on European maps, identifying mountains and rivers, and demarcating boundaries. Hermann Detzner and one Captain Nugent, R.A., had charge of a joint project to demarcate the British and German frontiers of Cameroon, which was published in 1913. Travelers and newspaper reporters brought back stories of black and brown natives serving German managers and settlers. There were also suspicions and reports of colonial malfeasance, corruption and brutality in some protectorates, and Lutheran and Roman Catholic missionaries dispatched disturbing reports to their mission headquarters in Germany.

Idealists often volunteered for selection and appointment to government posts; the commercially minded, to grow dividends at home for the Hanseatic trading houses and shipping lines. Subsequent historians would commend German colonialism in those years as &quot;an engine of modernization with far-reaching effects for the future.&quot;
==End of the German colonial empire (1914–1918)==
===Conquest in World War I===

In the years before the outbreak of the World War, British colonial officers viewed the Germans as deficient in &quot;colonial aptitude&quot;, but &quot;whose colonial administration was nevertheless superior to those of the other European states&quot;. Anglo-German colonial issues in the decade before 1914 were minor and both the British and German empires took conciliatory attitudes toward one another. Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey—still considered a moderate in 1911—was willing to &quot;study the map of Africa in a pro-German spirit&quot;. Britain further recognized that Germany really had little of value to offer in territorial transactions; however, advice to Grey and Prime Minister H. H. Asquith hardened by early 1914 &quot;to stop the trend of what the advisors considered Germany&#x27;s taking and Britain&#x27;s giving.&quot;

Once war was declared in late July 1914 Britain and its allies promptly moved against the colonies. The public was informed that German colonies were a threat because &quot;Every German colony has a powerful wireless station – they will talk to one another across the seas, and at every opportunity they [German ships] will dash from cover to harry and destroy our commerce, and maybe, to raid our coasts.&quot; The British position that Germany was a uniquely brutal and cruel colonial power originated during the war; it had not been said during peacetime. The German overseas Colonies began to fall one by one to the allied forces. The first to go was Togoland to the British and to the French. Germany&#x27;s colonies put up a stout fight but by 1916 Germany lost most of its colonies, except German East Africa, where a German force of General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck held out against the Allies until the end of the war.

In the Pacific, Britain&#x27;s ally Japan declared war on Germany in 1914 and quickly seized several of Germany&#x27;s island colonies, the Mariana, Caroline and Marshall Islands, with virtually no resistance. One reason these colonies fell so easily is because of the departure of Admiral von Spee&#x27;s fleet. In other parts of the Pacific Western Samoa, another German colony fell without a fight to a New Zealand force. Later on an Australian invasion of Neu-Pommern beat the Germans seizing the entire colony within a few weeks.

South Africa&#x27;s J. C. Smuts, now in Britain&#x27;s small War Cabinet, spoke of German schemes for world power, militarization and exploitation of resources, indicating Germany threatened western civilization itself. While propaganda was said about both sides it was here in Africa where Germany saw a crushing defeat. It was at Togoland where the Germans were quickly outnumbered leaving them to flee the capital which led to a large pursuit of German forces by allied armies leading to the eventual surrender of German forces on 26 August 1914. Smuts&#x27; warnings were repeated in the press. The idea took hold that they should not be returned to Germany after the war.

===Confiscation===
Germany&#x27;s overseas empire was dismantled following defeat in World War I. With the concluding Treaty of Versailles, Article 22, German colonies were transformed into League of Nations mandates and divided between Belgium, the United Kingdom and certain British Dominions, France and Japan with the determination not to see any of them returned to Germany – a guarantee secured by Article 119.

In Africa, the United Kingdom and France divided German Kamerun (Cameroons) and Togoland. Belgium gained Ruanda-Urundi in northwestern German East Africa, the United Kingdom obtained by far the greater landmass of this colony, thus gaining the &quot;missing link&quot; in the chain of British possessions stretching from South Africa to Egypt (Cape to Cairo), and Portugal received the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa. German South West Africa was taken under mandate by the Union of South Africa. In terms of the population of 12.5 million people in 1914, 42 percent were transferred to mandates of Britain and its dominions, 33 percent to France, and 25 percent to Belgium.

In the Pacific, Japan gained Germany&#x27;s islands north of the equator (the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands) and Kiautschou in China. German Samoa was assigned to New Zealand; German New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and Nauru went to Australia as mandates.

British placement of surrogate responsibility for former German colonies on white-settler dominions was at the time determined to be the most expedient option for the British government – and an appropriate reward for the Dominions having fulfilled their &quot;great and urgent imperial service&quot; through military intervention at the behest of and for Great Britain. It also meant that British colonies now had colonies of their own – which was very much influenced at the Paris proceedings by W. M. Hughes, William Massey, and Louis Botha, the prime ministers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The principle of &quot;self-determination&quot; embodied in the League of Nations covenant was not considered to apply to these colonies and was &quot;regarded as meaningless&quot;. To &quot;allay President [Woodrow] Wilson&#x27;s suspicions of British imperialism&quot;, the system of &quot;mandates&quot; was drawn up and agreed to by the British War Cabinet (with the French and Italians in tow), a device by which conquered enemy territory would be held not as a possession but as &quot;sacred trusts&quot;. But &quot;far from envisaging the eventual independence of the [former] German colonies, Allied statesmen at the Paris Conference regarded 1919 as the renewal, not the end, of an imperial era.&quot; In deliberations the British &quot;War Cabinet had confidence that natives everywhere would opt for British rule&quot;; however, the cabinet acknowledged &quot;the necessity to prove that its policy toward the German colonies was not motivated by aggrandizement&quot; since the Empire was seen by America as a &quot;land devouring octopus&quot; with a &quot;voracious territorial appetite&quot;.

President Wilson saw the League of Nations as &quot;&#x27;residuary trustee&#x27; for the [German] colonies&quot; captured and occupied by &quot;rapacious conquerors&quot;. The victors retained the German overseas possessions and did so with the belief that Australian, Belgian, British, French, Japanese, New Zealand, Portuguese and South African rule was superior to Germany&#x27;s. Several decades later during the collapse of the then existing colonial empires, Africans and Asians cited the same arguments that had been used by the Allies against German colonial rule – they now simply demanded &quot;to stand by themselves&quot;.

==Colonialism after 1918==

In Germany after the First World War, the general public opinion was that the seizure of the colonies had been unlawful and that Germany had a right to its colonies. Nearly all the parties elected to the Weimar National Assembly on 19 January 1919, voted in favor of a resolution which demanded the return of the colonies on 1 March 1919, i.e. while the Paris Peace Conference was still in progress. Only seven delegates from the USPD voted against it. The charge that Germany had failed to &quot;civilize&quot; the peoples under its control was seen as particularly outrageous – this had played a central role in German colonialism&#x27;s self-legitimation. This protest achieved nothing – in the final version of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was required to give up all its colonies. With the exception of German Southwest Africa, where some descendants of German settlers still live today (the German Namibians), all Germans were required to leave the colonies.

=== Weimar Republic ===
Even in the early phase of the Weimar Republic, there were voices calling for the return of the colonies – among them Konrad Adenauer, who was then mayor of Cologne. Adenauer was Deputy President of the German Colonial Society from 1931 to 1933. From 1924 there was a Colonial Office in the Federal Foreign Office, directed by Edmund Brückner, the former Governor of Togo. Brückner&#x27;s policy was that the return of Togo, Cameroon, and German East Africa were the most likely. In 1925, the Colonial Imperial Society (&#x27;Korag&#x27;) was established as an umbrella organization, from which the Reichskolonialbund emerged in 1933. Also in 1925, Johannes Bell, who had been Colonial Minister in the Scheidemann cabinet, founded the &quot;Interparty Colonial Union&quot;, which included members of the whole political spectrum, from the Nazi party to the SPD. In 1925, some settlers also returned to their plantations in Cameroon, which they had bought the previous year with financial support from the Foreign Office. In anticipation of the recovery of the colonies, the Colonial Women&#x27;s School of Rendsburg was founded in 1926. In 1931, an Institute for Foreign and Colonial Forestry was founded at the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry.

The treaty of Versailles attributed war guilt to Germany, but most Germans did not accept this and many saw the confiscation of the colonies by the Allies as a theft, especially after the South African premier Louis Botha stated that all allegations which the Allies had published during the war about the German colonial empire were, without exception, baseless fabrications. German colonial revisionists spoke of a &quot;Colonial Guilt Myth.&quot;

=== Nazi period 1933–1945 ===
Chancellor Adolf Hitler&#x27;s speeches sometimes did mention return of the lost colonies, as a bargaining point, but at all times his real target was Eastern Europe. In 1934, the Nazi Party established its own Office of Colonial Policy, which was led by Heinrich Schnee, and then Franz Ritter von Epp and was a very active grass roots organization. The Reichskolonialbund, established in 1936, under Franz Ritter von Epp absorbed all colonial organizations and was meant to raise procolonial sentiments, and build public interest in former German colonies. However, no new overseas colonial enterprises took place and with the onset of World War II in 1939 the organization entered a decline. It was disbanded by decree in 1943 for &quot;activity irrelevant to the war&quot;. Although it tolerated the colonialists, the Nazi government focused on territorial gains inside Europe. At no time did it negotiate or demand from London or Paris the return of any lost colony. According to Willeke Sandler: &quot;Between 1933 and 1943, Rudolf Hess, Martin Borman, and Joachim von Ribbentrop, among others, hindered colonialists&#x27; publicity activities, seeing them as representative of a discarded past and as irrelevant when compared with Eastern European &#x27;Lebensraum.

==Administration and colonial policies==
===Colonial administration===


Between 1890 and 1907, the uppermost leadership of the empire&#x27;s protectorates (&quot;Schutzgebiete&quot;) was the Colonial Division (&quot;Kolonialabteilung&quot;) of the Foreign Office (&quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;), which was headed by the Imperial Chancellor. In 1907, the Colonial Division was separated from the Foreign Office and became its own ministry (&quot;Amt&quot;), called the Imperial Colonial Office (&quot;Reichskolonialamt&quot;), with Bernhard Dernburg as its state secretary.

By an Imperial decree of 10 October 1890, the Colonial Council (&quot;Kolonialrat&quot;) was placed alongside the Colonial Division. It contained representatives of the Colonial Societies and experts appointed by the Chancellor.

The German treaty port of Kiautschou was administered by the Imperial Naval Office (&quot;Reichsmarineamt&quot;), not the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office.

The highest legal authority for the colonies was the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) in Leipzig.

The legal situation in the colonies was first regulated by the 1886 law concerning the legal relationships of the German protectorates, which became the (&quot;Schutzgebietsgesetz&quot;) in 1900 after further changes. It introduced German law in the German colonies for Europeans, through consular jurisdiction. The Consular Jurisdiction Law (&quot;Konsulargerichtsbarkeitsgesetz &quot;) of 1879 had granted German consuls overseas jurisdiction over German citizens in specific circumstances. The Protectorate Law specified that the regulations on consular jurisdiction would also apply in the colonies. In so far as they were relevant to consular jurisdiction, therefore, various important legal provisions of civil law, criminal law, legal procedure, and due process also came into force in the colonies. Alongside this, over time, further special provisions of colonial law were established. For indigenous people in the colonies, the Kaiser initially held all legislative power. Over the following years, the Imperial Chancellor and other officials empowered by him were also given the authority to regulate the administration, jurisdiction, policing, etc. of the colonies. Thus, in the German colonies there was, at a fundamental level, a dual legal structure, with different laws for the Europeans and the indigenous people. No colonial criminal law code was codified during German colonial rule.

==== Administration of individual colonies ====

At the top of the administration of each colony was the Governor, who was aided by a chancellor (as deputy and assistance in legal matters), secretaries, and other officials.

The districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), the largest administrative subdivisions of a colony, were administered by a District Officer (&quot;Bezirksamtmann&quot;). In turn, a district was divided into district branches (&quot;Bezirksnebenstellen&quot;). Another form of administration in the colonies was the Resident (&quot;Residentur&quot;). These were comparable to the districts in size, but the native rulers were allowed far more power in residencies than in districts, helping to keep the costs of German administration as low as possible.

Schutztruppen were stationed in the colonies of Cameroon, Southwest Africa, and East Africa for internal military security. The police forces in the colonies were police troops (&quot;Polizeitruppen&quot;), organized on military lines. In the Kiautschou Leased Bay Territory, which was under the control of the German Imperial Naval Office, marines of the 3rd Sea Battalion were stationed as police.

In the colonies, there were Protectorate Courts (&quot;Schutzgebietsgerichte&quot;), modeled on consular courts. Jurisdiction over indigenous peoples, especially in criminal cases, was invested in the colonial officials in the colonies. In noncriminal matters, indigenous authorities were granted jurisdiction over their communities and could render judgment in accordance with local law.

For Germans and other Europeans, the district court (&quot;Bezirksgericht&quot;) had jurisdiction in first instance and there was a right of appeal to an upper court (&quot;Obergericht&quot;). In Togo, the size of the European population made an upper court impractical, so the upper court of Kamerun also acted as the appellate court for Togo.

===German colonial population===
The German colonial population numbered 5,125 in 1903, and about 23,500 in 1913. The German pre–World War I colonial population consisted of 19,696 Germans in Africa and the Pacific colonies in 1913, including more than 3,000 police and soldiers, and 3,806 in Kiaochow (1910), of which 2,275 were navy and military staff. In Africa (1913), 12,292 Germans lived in Southwest Africa, 4,107 in German East Africa and 1,643 in Cameroon. In the Pacific colonies in 1913 there were 1,645 Germans. After 1905 a ban on marriage was enacted forbidding mixed couples between German and native population in South West Africa, and after 1912 in Samoa.

After World War I, the military and &quot;undesired persons&quot; were expelled from the German protectorates. In 1934 the former colonies were inhabited by 16,774 Germans, of whom about 12,000 lived in the former Southwest African colony. Once the new owners of the colonies again permitted immigration from Germany, the numbers rose in the following years above the pre–World War I total.

=== Relationship between German and indigenous populations ===
==== Legal inequality ====
The relationship between the Germans and the indigenous populations in the German colonies was characterized by legal and social inequalities. There were two separate legal systems and people were assigned to one or the other on the basis of racial criteria. The &quot;whites&quot; (i.e. the German and European inhabitants of the colonies) formed a small, highly privileged minority – rarely reaching even 1% of a colony&#x27;s total population. They enjoyed all the rights, privileges, and duties of normal German law. Non-German Europeans were legally their equals.

The 13 million or so &quot;natives&quot; of the German colonial empire did not become German citizens in 1913, when German citizenship was first introduced. They were not considered Imperial citizens, but only subjects or wards of Germany. German laws applied to them only if explicitly stated by the individual statute. In particular, they were shut out of the court system. They had no right of appeal against decisions of the colonial authorities or first-instance judgments. For the 10,000 or so people of Arab and Indian descent who lived in German East Africa, the governors had the ability to issue special regulations. According to the Protectorate Law, however, it was possible for &quot;natives&quot; to be granted Imperial citizenship and to pass that citizenship on to their children. The cause of this was the fact that the children of mixed marriages automatically received German citizenship. This was perceived as a threat to the &quot;German body politic&quot; and its &quot;racial purity.&quot; As sexual relationships between the population groups had grown increasingly common, the colonies gradually banned &quot;civil marriage between whites and natives&quot; from 1905. Extra-marital sexual relationships were socially unacceptable, as leading to &quot;Kaffirization&quot; (&quot;Verkaffirung&quot;). In 1912, the Reichstag held a debate about the possibility of interracial relationships, resulting in most parties agreeing that such relationships should be legalized. However, no law on this was ever enacted. The ban remained in effect until the end of the German Empire.

==== Evangelism, education, and healthcare ====

The German colonizers conceived of the indigenous populations as &quot;children&quot;: people at a lower level of development, who had to be protected, educated, and raised up. German missionary societies were already concerning themselves with the education and conversion of overseas populations in the 1820s. Protestant organizations included the Berlin Missionary Society, Rhenish Missionary Society, , and the North German Missionary Society. After the Kulturkampf had subsided, Catholic missionary societies were allowed to operate in the colonies too.

These missionary societies established stations in the colonies, where they instructed the indigenous people in basic education, modern agricultural techniques, and Christianity. They had substantial success, since the breakdown of precolonial society, which the German land seizures and colonial wars had engendered, often brought a spiritual crisis with it and the indigenous people sought comfort and support from the god of the new rulers, who appeared to have proven his superiority. Since the goal of the missionaries was the conversion of the indigenous peoples and they emphasized the virtue of neighborly love, they often had cause to protest against their abuse and exploitation by the colonial administration and plantation owners. In order to support themselves and to model good behavior, the missionaries themselves often had plantations, which were dependent on the indigenous people&#x27;s skill and willingness to work. These goals often came into conflict. The missionaries were generally rather tolerant regarding traditional customs and practices. For example, they often allowed polygamy, which was widespread in Africa and the Pacific. The exception to this was the Islamic culture of the East African coast, which the missionaries strongly opposed.

===Medicine and science===
In her African and South Seas colonies, Germany established diverse biological and agricultural stations. Staff specialists and the occasional visiting university group conducted soil analyses, developed plant hybrids, experimented with fertilizers, studied vegetable pests and ran courses in agronomy for settlers and natives and performed a host of other tasks. Successful German plantation operators realized the benefits of systematic scientific inquiry and instituted and maintained their own stations with their own personnel, who further engaged in exploration and documentation of the native fauna and flora.

Research by bacteriologists Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich and other scientists was funded by the imperial treasury and was freely shared with other nations. More than three million Africans were vaccinated against smallpox. Medical doctors the world over benefited from pioneering work into tropical diseases and German pharmaceutical discoveries &quot;became a standard therapy for sleeping sickness and relapsing fever. The German presence (in Africa) was vital for significant achievements in medicine and agriculture.&quot;

By the late 1880s German physicians identified venereal disease as a public health threat to Germany and its colonies. To fight it in Germany doctors used biopolitics to educate and regulate the bodies of likely victims. Propaganda campaigns did not work well in the colonies, so they imposed a much greater degree of supervision and coercion over targeted groups such as prostitutes.

During the Herero genocide Eugen Fischer, a German scientist, came to the concentration camps to conduct medical experiments on race, using children of Herero people and multiracial children of Herero women and German men as test subjects. Together with Theodor Mollison he also experimented upon Herero prisoners. Those experiments included sterilization, injection of smallpox, typhus as well as tuberculosis.
The numerous cases of mixed offspring upset the German colonial administration, which was concerned with maintaining &quot;racial purity&quot;. Eugen Fischer studied 310 multiracial children, calling them &quot;Rehoboth bastards&quot; of &quot;lesser racial quality&quot;. Fischer also subjected them to numerous racial tests such as head and body measurements, and eye and hair examinations. In conclusion of his studies he advocated genocide of alleged &quot;inferior races&quot;, stating that &quot;whoever thinks thoroughly the notion of race, can not arrive at a different conclusion&quot;.
Fischer&#x27;s actions (at the time considered) scientific and his torment of the children were part of a wider history of abusing Africans for experiments, and echoed earlier actions by German anthropologists who stole skeletons and bodies from African graveyards and took them to Europe for research or sale. An estimated 3000 skulls were sent to Germany for study. In October 2011, after three years of talks, the first skulls were due to be returned to Namibia for burial.
Other experiments were made by Doctor Bofinger, who injected Herero who were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium. Afterward, he researched the effects of these substances by performing autopsies on dead bodies.

===Social Darwinism===

Social Darwinism is the theory &quot;that human groups and races are subject to the same laws of natural selection as Charles Darwin had perceived in plants and animals in nature.&quot; According to numerous historians, an important ideological component of German nationalism as developed by the intellectual elite was Social Darwinism. It gave an impetus to German assertiveness as a world economic and military power, aimed at competing with France and the British Empire for world power. German colonial rule in Africa 1884–1914 was an expression of nationalism and moral superiority that was justified by constructing an image of the natives as &quot;Other&quot;. German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of &#x27;culture&#x27; and &#x27;civilization&#x27;. Techniques included genocide in parts of Africa. Furthermore, the wide acceptance among intellectuals of social Darwinism justified Germany&#x27;s right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27;, according to historian Michael Schubert.
On the other hand, Germany&#x27;s cultural-missionary project boasted that its colonial programs were humanitarian and educational endeavors. Colonial German physicians and administrators tried to make a case for increasing the native population, in order to also increase their numbers of laborers. Eugene Fischer, an anthropologist at the University of Freiburg, agreed with that notion saying that they should only be supported as necessary and as they prove to be useful. Once their use is gone, Europeans should &quot;allow free competition, which in my (Fischer&#x27;s) opinion means their demise.&quot;

The Duala people, a Bantu group in Cameroon, readily welcomed German policies. The number of German-speaking Africans increased in four West African German colonies prior to 1914. The Duala leadership in 1884 placed the tribe under German rule. Most converted to Protestantism and were educated along German lines. Colonial officials and businessmen preferred them as inexpensive clerks to German government offices and firms in Africa.

==Legacy==
===Continuity thesis===

In recent years scholars have debated the &quot;continuity thesis&quot; that links German colonialist brutalities to the treatment of Jews, Roma, Poles and Russians during World War II. Some historians argue that Germany&#x27;s role in southwestern Africa gave rise to an emphasis on racial superiority at home, which in turn was used by the Nazis. They argue that the limited successes of German colonialism overseas led to a decision to shift the main focus of German expansionism into Central and Eastern Europe, with the Mitteleuropa plan. German colonialism, therefore, turned to the European continent.

While a minority view during the &quot;Kaiserzeit&quot;, the idea developed in full swing under Erich Ludendorff and his political activity in the Baltic states, Ukraine, and Poland. Subsequently, after the defeat of Russia during World War I, Germany acquired vast territories with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and created several administrative regions like Ober Ost. Here also the German settlement would be implemented, and the whole governmental organization was developed to serve German needs while controlling the local ethnically diverse population. While the African colonies were too isolated and not suitable for mass settlement of Germans, areas in Central and Eastern Europe offered better potential for German settlement. Other scholars are skeptical and challenge the continuity thesis. Additionally, however, only one former colonial officer gained an important position in the Nazi administrative hierarchy.

===Federal Republic===

Regaining the former German colonies played no significant role in the politics of Post-war Germany. However, individual West German politicians proposed undertaking late or postcolonial enterprises, especially the management of trusts in Tanganyika or Togo. Even within the African freedom movement, these suggestions co-existed with calls for decolonization. At the end of 1952, members of the Ewe people submitted in a memorandum to the United Nations Trusteeship Council proposing that the territories of German Togoland taken by the British and the French be reunited and led towards independence together. While this initiative was not accepted, in 1960, Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburg, the last Imperial German governor of Togo, was invited to Togo&#x27;s independence celebrations by Sylvanus Olympio, President of Togo.

Efforts to revive the Colonial War League after the Second World War led to the establishment in Hamburg in 1955 of a &quot;Union of Former Colonial Troops,&quot; ancestor of the current .

The final remains of the Protectorate Law survived until the legal expiration of the Colonial Society in 1975 and fiscal adjustments in 1992. Colonial history continues to be commemorated by colonial monuments, street names, and buildings related to German colonial history. In many places this has led to discussions about cultural memory and to calls for modification or renaming.

Representatives of the Herero and Nama, whose ancestors were killed in their thousands in German-administered Southwest Africa between 1904 and 1908, have taken legal action against Germany in the American courts. In January 2017, a class action against the German government was submitted to a court in New York. The statement of claim speaks of over 100,000 fatalities. In March 2017, it became known that the Namibian government was considering an action against Germany in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It was said that damages were sought in the region of 30 billion dollars.

The publication of edited volumes on the themes of colonialism (2012) and German Colonial History (2019) by the Federal Agency for Civic Education aimed to bring about &quot;revived awareness of colonialism in political, legal, and psychological spheres&quot; to a wider group of readers and scholars, as the editor Asiye Öztürk put it. In 2015, Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf and the University of Dschang in Cameroon established a joint-research project on &quot;Colonial links&quot;, which culminated in an exhibition in Düsseldorf in 2017. After that, the exhibition traveled to Dschang and to various German cities, where it was augmented with aspects of local relevance. Finally, a volume on the exhibition was published in 2019.

===Impact===

Unlike other colonial empires such as the British, French, Portuguese or Spanish, the Germans left very few traces of their own language, institutions or customs in its former colonies. 

Currently, no country outside Europe uses German as an official language, although in Namibia, it is a recognized national language and there are numerous German placenames and architectural structures in the country. A 30,000 German ethnic minority resides in the country. In a long-term legacy of the East German Stasi&#x27;s covert backing of the SWAPO guerrillas during the 1967–1989 South African Border War, a significant German-speaking minority exists among the Black population, who were brought up as children in Cold War era East Germany before the Peaceful Revolution in 1989.

After the end of World War II, many of the activists for Tanganyika&#x27;s independence were the sons of Schutztruppe Askaris, who had fought for the last Kaiser during the East African Campaign. According to his biographers Leonard Mosley and Robert Gaudi, these activists often travelled to West Germany, during the last decades before the Decolonisation of Africa, to seek the advice of their fathers&#x27; former commanding officer, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.

According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; journalists Heinz Höhne and Hermann Zolling, the premature end of the German colonial empire in 1918 placed West Germany&#x27;s Cold War foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) and its founding chief Reinhard Gehlen at a considerable advantage in dealing with the newly independent governments of post-colonial Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This is why many Third World militaries and foreign intelligence services were largely trained by BND military advisors. This made it possible for the BND to easily receive highly detailed and accurate intelligence reports from these regions in which the Central Intelligence Agency and especially the former colonialists&#x27; intelligence services could not acquire without recruiting local spy rings. BND covert activities in the Third World also laid the groundwork for friendly relations that Gen. Gehlen attempted to use to steer local governments into taking an anti-Soviet and Pro-NATO stance during the ongoing Cold War and further assisted the West German economic miracle by both encouraging and favoring West German trade and corporate investment. 

At the same time, however, when West Germany&#x27;s Goethe Institute was founded to encourage German-language learning and cultural diplomacy worldwide, the first foreign branches were founded in 1961, in the last Kaiser&#x27;s former African colonies of Cameroon and Togo. Tanzania opened a Goethe Institute branch immediately after achieving independence from the British Empire later in that same year. 

In post-World War I Rwanda, German colonial rule was nostalgically glorified and positively contrasted with the region&#x27;s subsequent rule by the Belgian colonial empire. Close relations with West Germany were restored immediately following Rwandan independence and German military advisors helped train the Rwandan armed forces. The Goethe-Institute opened in the capital city of Kigali in 2009 and has since expanded into a separate building.

The German language remains a popular subject of study for students in all three nations. Furthermore, a lasting legacy of Imperial German rule remains in the significant number of German language borrowings in the Tanzanian dialect of Kiswahili. Examples include as &quot;shule&quot; (school), &quot;hela&quot; (money) and &quot;nusu kaputi&quot; (literally: half broken = full anesthesia).

<doc id="762774" wikidata="Q858993" url="?curid=762774" title="Castle Rock (Stephen King)">
<text>Castle Rock (sometimes referred to as the Rock) is a fictional town appearing in Stephen King&#x27;s fictional Maine topography, providing the setting for a number of his novels, novellas, and short stories. Castle Rock first appeared in King&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and has since been referred to or used as the primary setting in many other works by King.

As a native of Durham, Maine, King was inspired by his hometown when creating Castle Rock. The town name is taken from the fictional mountain fort in William Golding&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.

Other notable fictional towns that King has used as the central setting in more than one work include Derry and Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot.

== Population and geographical location ==
The population of Castle Rock was 1,280 by 1959 and around 1,500 in &quot;Needful Things&quot;. According to the book cover, &quot;Needful Things&quot; was &quot;The Last Castle Rock Story&quot;. However, the town later served as the setting for the short story &quot;It Grows on You&quot;, published in King&#x27;s 1993 collection &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;. This story, according to King, serves as an epilogue to &quot;Needful Things&quot;.

In &quot;Needful Things&quot;, Castle Rock is placed 18 miles southwest of South Paris. In &quot;The Body&quot;, Harlow is 30 miles east of Castle Rock. In the anthology film &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), written by King, a sign at the end of &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; puts Portland at 37 miles, and Boston at 188 miles. &quot;Weeds&quot;, the 1976 short story on which &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; was based, was set in New Hampshire.

Geographically, this puts Castle Rock within 37 miles of Portland, Maine. This region could include real places such as Durham, Lisbon, Danville, Auburn, Lewiston, Bridgton, and maybe even Sabattus. 

In the short story Mrs. Todd&#x27;s Shortcut Castle Rock is described as being 79 miles from Bangor, Maine as the crow flies, with the most common driving route being 156.4 miles: Route 97 to Mechanic Falls, then Route 11 to Lewiston, and then the Interstate to Bangor.

A map on King&#x27;s official website places Castle Rock in Oxford County, in the vicinity of Woodstock. The works in which Castle Rock appears place the town in the fictional &quot;Castle County&quot;, which also includes such fictional towns as Castle Lake, Castle View, and Harlow. The location of Castle Rock may also be related to Marblehead, which has a park by the same name, but most likely not.

Part of the Castle Rock area is underlain by limestone. It makes the water hard and hosts at least one bat-infested cave unknown to the inhabitants, as noted in &quot;Cujo.&quot;

Besides Castle Rock and the oft-used Derry and Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot, King has created other fictional Maine towns. These include Chamberlain in &quot;Carrie;&quot; Chester&#x27;s Mill in &quot;Under the Dome;&quot; Haven in &quot;The Tommyknockers;&quot; Little Tall Island in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; and &quot;Storm of the Century;&quot; Harlow in &quot;Revival&quot;; Tarkers Mills in &quot;Cycle of the Werewolf&quot;, and Ludlow (unrelated to the real Maine town of Ludlow) in &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; and &quot;The Dark Half.&quot;

== Characters of Castle Rock ==

===George Bannerman===
George Bannerman is the sheriff of Castle Rock, appearing in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, and &quot;The Body&quot;. In &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, Bannerman, after years of failing to catch the local serial killer the Castle Rock Strangler, approaches Johnny Smith to help catch the Strangler. Bannerman is horrified to learn the Strangler is, in reality, Deputy Frank Dodd, whom he viewed as a surrogate son. The two men corner Dodd in his house, where he commits suicide. In &quot;Cujo&quot;, Bannerman helps organize the search for Donna and Tad Trenton, who are currently missing, and unbeknownst to anyone, trapped at the Camber house by the titular rabid Saint Bernard. Suspicious when there are no leads to their location and inspired by his previous investigation with Smith and the Dodd case, Bannerman checks at the Camber house and discovers Donna and Tad. Before he can phone in this discovery, Cujo appears and viciously mauls and disembowels him.

Bannerman was portrayed by Tom Skerritt in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and Sandy Ward in &quot;Cujo&quot;. In the television adaptation of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, Bannerman is merged with the character of Walt Hazlett to form the character Sheriff Walt Bannerman, portrayed by Chris Bruno.

===Joe Camber===
Appeared in the novel &quot;Cujo&quot; (1981) and portrayed by Ed Lauter in the film adaptation of the same name (1983), Joe is an alcoholic, controlling man who frequently abuses his wife Charity and is generally hostile to everyone around him; the only two exceptions are his son Brett and his friend Gary Pervier. The townspeople are aware of his hard drinking but consider him a competent, honest mechanic. Joe is mauled to death by his own dog, Cujo, once he becomes rabid.

===Alan Pangborn===
Alan Pangborn appears in the novel &quot;The Dark Half&quot; (1989), the novella &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; (1990), and the novel &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1991). He is also a primary character in the &quot;Castle Rock&quot; television series based on King&#x27;s novels. In &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, Pangborn is introduced as the Sheriff of the town Castle Rock. He has a wife Annie and two children, Toby (&quot;Al&quot;) and Todd. The story establishes that Pangborn has a penchant for magic tricks. Pangborn re-appears again as the main protagonist of &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which establishes him as a widower dating Polly Chalmers. The story reveals that Annie and Todd died in a car crash soon after the events of &quot;The Dark Half&quot;. Pangborn was portrayed by Michael Rooker in the film adaptation of &quot;The Dark Half&quot; and Ed Harris in the film &quot;Needful Things&quot;, both released in 1993. Alan and Polly are also briefly mentioned in &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; (1998) in a conversation between author Michael Noonan and the then-Castle County Sheriff Norris Ridgewick. Ridgewick mentions they are &quot;doing real well&quot; after having relocated to New Hampshire, though Polly still suffers from arthritis.
In the television series &quot;Castle Rock&quot;, which features an original story set around established Stephen King characters and stories, Alan Pangborn worked as town sheriff in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, but is now retired. He is in a romantic relationship with town resident Ruth Deaver and has pursued her since at least 1990. He is said to be a widower and shown to have an interest in magic and sleight of hand, but no mention is made in regards to Polly ever being in his life. Since the show and its characters regularly discuss the town&#x27;s history with murder and strange events, but do not ever reference the destruction the town suffered in &quot;Needful Things&quot;, the main events of that novel perhaps did not happen in the continuity of the show, and this version of Pangborn never met Polly. The younger Pangborn of the 1980 and 90s is portrayed by actor Jeffrey Pierce while the Pangborn of 2018 is portrayed by Scott Glenn.

=== Ace Merrill===
John &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill is a psychopathic, cruel bully who appears in &quot;The Body&quot;, &quot;The Sun Dog&quot;, &quot;Nona&quot;, and &quot;Needful Things&quot;. In &quot;The Body&quot;, Ace is the leader of some bullies who torment Gordie Lachance, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio. He later attempts to murder them after they find the body of Ray Browers, so that Ace and his gang will get the credit. Chris scares Ace and his gang off by threatening them with a handgun. As an adult, Gordie sees that Ace has become an alcoholic, overweight millworker and takes pleasure in seeing his tormentor so miserable. By the time of &quot;The Sun Dog&quot;, Ace has been sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary and disowned by his only remaining family, his uncle Pop Merrill. In &quot;Needful Things&quot;, Ace returns to his hometown, on the run to avoid being murdered by two drug dealers over unpaid debts. Ace now holds a grudge against Sheriff Alan Pangborn for being the one to arrest him. Ace becomes the right-hand man of Leland Gaunt, a demon who provides Ace with cocaine and the implications of buried treasure in exchange for procuring guns for him. In the climax of the novel, Ace and Buster Keeton team up at Gaunt&#x27;s behest to wreak havoc. Merrill holds Pangborn&#x27;s girlfriend Polly Chalmers at gunpoint when Gaunt and Pangborn confront each other, only to be shot in the head by Norris.

Merrill is played by Kiefer Sutherland in &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and Paul Sparks in the television series &quot;Castle Rock&quot;.

===Pop Merrill===
Reginald Marion &quot;Pop&quot; Merrill is a loan shark and the owner of the Emporium Galorium, a local junk store, who appears in &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; and is mentioned in &quot;Needful Things&quot;. Pop is a greedy, cruel, and miserly man, who often scams his customers and is disliked by the rest of the town. In spite of this, Pop is extremely wealthy and well-connected and serves a variety of clients, from desperate people he takes advantage of to renowned billionaires. In &quot;The Sun Dog&quot;, Kevin Delevan takes his haunted Sun 660 Polaroid camera (which only produces photos of a malevolent dog standing in front of a white picket fence that becomes increasingly monstrous as more photos are taken with it) to Pop, who is unable to uncover anything wrong with the camera. Kevin and his father John (who had previously been the victim of Pop&#x27;s outrageous interest rates) resolve to destroy the camera, but Pop, sensing the opportunity for money, swaps the camera with another Sun 660 and keeps the haunted one. All of Pop&#x27;s clients balk at it, either believing it to be a fraud or being overcome with dread when they see it. The dog also begins to gradually drive him mad, allowing it to take control of him and force him to take photos on the Sun 660, which Pop believes to be a broken cuckoo clock he is repairing. Kevin and John, who had caught on to Pop&#x27;s scam, attempt to stop him from releasing the dog, but they are too late; the dog breaks free, causing molten plastic to slice Pop&#x27;s throat open. The dog is trapped once again by Kevin, and the Emporium burns down. &quot;Needful Things&quot; shows that the reason for Pop&#x27;s death is unknown to the general public, though everyone, even his nephew Ace Merrill, is happy that he is dead. Gaunt later convinces Ace that Pop had buried part of his fortune to gain his assistance and cause a feud between him and Sheriff Pangborn.

Pop was portrayed by Tim Robbins in the television series &quot;Castle Rock&quot;. 

===Gary Pervier===
Gary Pervier is the closest neighbor to Joe Camber, and a local WWII veteran and alcoholic, who appears in &quot;Cujo&quot;. During WWII, Gary charged a German machine gun nest before retreating his squadron to safety. Gary wins a DSC award afterwards for this event. In the summer of 1980, Gary is living just outside of Castle Rock in a dilapidated house and is an alcoholic. Gary&#x27;s best friend is his neighbor, Joe Camber. After Joe&#x27;s wife Charity wins a large sum of lottery money, Joe convinces Gary to go on a trip with him down to Boston while Charity and Joe&#x27;s son Brett are visiting Charity&#x27;s sister in Connecticut. On the morning they are supposed to leave for Boston, Joe&#x27;s rabid Saint Bernard Cujo attacks Gary while he is going through a hangover in his yard. Cujo bites Gary on the shoulder before kicking Cujo away. Gary runs into his house to get his shotgun, but Cujo breaks through the screen door and charges at Gary, ripping his throat out. 

Gary was portrayed by Mills Watson in &quot;Cujo&quot; (film).

===Kevin Delevan===
Kevin Delevan is a local teenager who appears in &quot;The Sun Dog&quot;. On his 15th birthday, Kevin receives a Sun 660 Polaroid camera as a gift. The camera quickly proves to be supernatural in nature, as it only produces photographs of a malevolent dog in front of a white picket fence, that becomes closer to the photograph and increasingly monstrous as more photos are taken with the camera. For lack of a better option, Kevin takes the camera to Pop Merrill, and both quickly conclude that the camera is haunted. Kevin&#x27;s father John learns about this, as well, and the two decide to destroy the camera; however, Pop swaps the camera with another Sun 660. Kevin experiences psychic dreams where he enters “Polaroidville”, an odd dimension that exists within photographs; Kevin comes to the conclusion that the dog is a predator from Polaroidsville that sees the real world as a new hunting ground, and that he is receiving the messages from Polaroidsville&#x27;s &quot;dogcatcher&quot;, who, through cryptic clues, reveals to Kevin that the only way to stop the dog is to take another photo of it and that Pop kept the camera. John and Kevin go to stop Pop from freeing the dog, but are too late; the dog breaks loose and kills Merrill, but Kevin is able to trap it within another Sun 660. A year later, on his 16th birthday, Kevin is given a computer as a gift. When he turns it on, he receives a message from the dog, which reveals that the dog is loose again and is eager to get revenge against Kevin.

===Frank Dodd===
Frank Dodd is a deputy serving under Sheriff George Bannerman, while also moonlighting as the Castle Rock Strangler, a serial killer who rapes and murders women, who appears in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; novel, and is referenced in almost all stories set in Castle Rock. Dodd uses his involvement in the investigation to keep track of its progress and avoid capture. Dodd murders 6 women and girls from 1970 to 1975. Dodd&#x27;s first victim is a young waitress whom he rapes and strangles in the Castle Rock town common. After Dodd murders a nine-year-old girl, who is found in the same location as his first victim, Bannerman brings in psychic Johnny Smith to assist in the investigation. Smith discovers Dodd is the killer, and Bannerman and Smith corner Dodd in his home, where he commits suicide and writes “I CONFESS” in lipstick on his neck. By the time of &quot;Cujo&quot;, Frank has become a local boogeyman to the children of Castle Rock. Tad Trenton&#x27;s closet is haunted by a malevolent spirit that claims to be Dodd&#x27;s ghost and threatens to murder the boy. The ghost later appears before the boy&#x27;s father Vic while he sits in Tad&#x27;s room. When Cujo attacks Sheriff George Bannerman, he imagines that the dog is possessed by the ghost of Dodd, and mentally inquires if he came back because Hell was too hot for him.

Dodd is portrayed by Nicholas Campbell in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; film and by Michael Rogers in the television series.

===Cujo===
Cujo is a Saint Bernard owned by the Camber family and the titular character of &quot;Cujo&quot;, and is referenced in several of King&#x27;s other works. Cujo is initially a playful dog that is friendly to every person he meets, although rabbits drive him wild. One day he chases a rabbit into a cave and is bitten by a rabid bat. No one notes much significance to the wound, but as it festers Cujo becomes depressed and occasionally ill-tempered (people think he&#x27;s just bothered by the summer heat or, as observed by two delivery men, &quot;going bad&quot;), then goes mad. He becomes convinced that humans are responsible for his pain, and this prompts him to go on a murderous rampage. After murdering Joe Camber and Gary Pervier, Cujo traps Donna and Tad Trenton inside their broken-down car after they come for auto repairs. Cujo refuses to allow them to leave, and continually tries to break in and kill them. When Donna leaves the car to escape, Cujo bites her repeatedly, though she manages to evade death, and Cujo continues to keep a watchful eye over the car. Eventually, Sheriff George Bannerman arrives and attempts to phone in his discovery of the two, only for Cujo to disembowel him. Donna impales him in the eye with a broken baseball bat, killing him.

=== Television ===
In February 2017, Hulu announced they were partnering with J. J. Abrams and Stephen King to create a limited series entitled &quot;Castle Rock&quot;. Later that month, Hulu issued a ten-episode order for the series, with production set to begin at a later date. It was also revealed that the series would bring together characters and situations from throughout King&#x27;s entire canon. Filming for the series began in August 2017. The small Western Massachusetts town of Orange served as a stand in for filming scenes set in Castle Rock.

The series premiered on Hulu on July 25, 2018. In August 2018, Hulu announced that they have renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on October 23, 2019.

=== Film ===
The town of Castle Rock made its first onscreen appearance in the 1983 film &quot;Cujo&quot;. In that film, Mendocino and Santa Rosa, California stood in for Castle Rock. That same year, Castle Rock appeared onscreen again in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. This time, the Maine town was portrayed by locations in and around Niagara Falls, Ontario, including the Screaming Tunnel and Queen&#x27;s Royal Park in neighboring Niagara-on-the-Lake.

&quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), a film adaptation of King&#x27;s 1982 novella &quot;The Body&quot;, was the next film in which Castle Rock appeared. However, in this version of the story, Castle Rock is located in the state of Oregon. Filming took place in Oregon as well as California, with locations including Brownsville, Oregon and Lake Britton in Shasta County, California. Director Rob Reiner later named his production company Castle Rock Entertainment, which subsequently produced several adaptations of King&#x27;s works.

In addition to appearing onscreen, the town of Castle Rock is also referenced in several films. The first such reference came in the 1982 film &quot;Creepshow&quot;, which was Stephen King&#x27;s first produced screenplay. At the end of the film&#x27;s &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill&quot; segment, a directional sign shows Castle Rock located five miles away.

In the 1990 film adaptation of &quot;Graveyard Shift,&quot; the character Jane Wisconsky tells John Hall she is originally from Castle Rock.

The screenplay to the 1992 film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; was also written by King. In the film, the sheriff calls for backup from Castle Rock. However, this version of Castle Rock is located in Indiana.

The town of Gibsons, British Columbia, Canada serves as the location of Castle Rock in the 1993 film Needful Things.

In the 2007 film adaptation of King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Mist&quot; (1980), David Drayton reads a newspaper called &quot;The Castle Rock Times&quot;.

<text>Nicholas Scott Lachey ( ; born November 9, 1973) is an American actor, singer-songwriter, producer, TV personality and host. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the multi-platinum-selling boyband 98 Degrees and later starred in the reality series &quot;&quot; with his then-wife, Jessica Simpson. He has released four solo albums: &quot;SoulO&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot;, &quot;A Father&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, and &quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot;. He also had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Charmed&quot;. He hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Sing-Off&quot;, co-hosted VH1&#x27;s &quot;Big Morning Buzz Live&quot; from 2014 to 2015, and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Most Musical Family&quot;, and co-hosts the Netflix shows &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; and &quot;The Ultimatum&quot; with his wife Vanessa Lachey. He is also the sole host of &quot;Perfect Match&quot; for Netflix. In 2021, Lachey won the fifth season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

==Early life==
Lachey was born in Harlan, Kentucky, to Cathalyn (née Fopma) and John Lachey. He is the brother of singer and actor Drew Lachey, alongside whom he has worked closely. His maternal grandfather, Robert James Fopma, was of Dutch descent. Nick&#x27;s other ancestry is English, Scottish, German, and distant Welsh, Yiddish and French. He attended Clovernook Elementary School in the Cincinnati suburb of North College Hill, Ohio, and the School for Creative and Performing Arts in Cincinnati. He attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon. In the fall of 1992, he allegedly enrolled at the University of Southern California, according to a &quot;statement&quot; he made during his guest appearance on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; on December 12, 2013.

==Career==
Lachey started his professional singing career at Kings Island with close &amp; very best friend Justin Jeffre in the mid-1990s singing in a do-wop singing group quartet throughout the park and water park. Lachey was a member of the boyband 98 Degrees along with his brother, Drew, Justin Jeffre, and Jeff Timmons. Their debut album was the self-titled &quot;98 Degrees&quot;; however, the band&#x27;s first real success came with their follow-up album &quot;98 Degrees and Rising&quot;. 98 Degrees has sold over 10 million records. 98 Degrees performed a one-off summer reunion show in Hershey, Pennsylvania, at the Summer Mixtape Festival on August 18, 2012, their first concert in more than a decade.

During the summer of 2003, the reality show &quot;&quot;, starring Lachey and then-wife Jessica Simpson, began airing on MTV. The couple starred in the television special &quot;The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour&quot;, which aired in 2004 and was compared to &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Show&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Newlyweds&quot; won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Reality Show before wrapping shortly after. On November 11, 2003, his solo debut album, &quot;SoulO&quot;, was released. Despite being released during the success of &quot;Newlyweds&quot;, the album was a commercial failure. Lachey took a recurring role in the series &quot;Charmed&quot; where he played a dyslexic ghostwriter between 2004 and 2005.
&quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot; was released on May 9, 2006, and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified Gold, after selling more than 500,000 copies domestically. The first single from the album was the title track, &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot;, released on February 21, 2006. The song became a hit, reaching a peak position of number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The video for &quot;What&#x27;s Left Of Me&quot; featured former MTV VJ, Vanessa Minnillo. Lachey recorded &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; for the Oprah Winfrey-produced film, &quot;For One More Day&quot;. Lachey began working on his third solo album in 2007. Lachey also starred in a well-known TV series, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, as a singer at Red Bedroom Productions. It was announced in January 2010 that Jive Records had put his new album on hold indefinitely. In June 2010, Lachey confirmed that he had parted ways with Jive Records. In July 2010, Jive Records confirmed they had parted ways with Lachey.

&quot;Taking the Stage&quot;, a musical reality show documenting the personal lives of high school students at the School for Creative and Performing Arts, premiered on MTV in March 2009. It was produced by Lachey. In December 2009, he hosted &quot;The Sing-Off&quot;, a long form four-part American singing competition featuring a cappella groups, a role he reprised in December 2010 for the show&#x27;s second and third seasons on NBC. Lachey was a contestant in the NBC celebrity reality competition series called &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot;.

On January 16, 2014, VH1 announced Lachey would resume hosting Big Morning Buzz Live, upon its return on March 3, 2014. On September 6, 2017, Lachey was announced as one of the celebrities who will take part in the 25th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, competing against his wife Vanessa. He was paired with professional dancer Peta Murgatroyd. Murgatroyd&#x27;s husband, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, was paired with Vanessa. On October 23, Lachey and Murgatroyd were the fifth couple to be eliminated from the competition, leaving in ninth place.

Lachey hosted a musical competition on Nickelodeon titled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Musical Family&quot; which premiered on November 1, 2019.

Lachey and his wife currently co-host the Netflix reality shows &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; and &quot;The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On&quot;. Lachey also hosts &quot;Perfect Match&quot; for Netflix, solo.

==Other ventures==
Lachey is part owner of the Hollywood Fame, a team in the American Basketball Association that began play in fall 2006, and was part of an ownership group of the Tacoma Rainiers, the Seattle Mariners&#x27; Triple-A affiliate. Lachey is also a die-hard Cincinnati Bengals, Cincinnati Reds and Cincinnati Bearcats fan. On April 7, 2009, Lachey threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the MLB Opening Day game in Cincinnati, Ohio. On July 9, 2011, Lachey sang the National Anthem for the inaugural NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, Kentucky.

Lachey was among a group of investors that placed a marijuana legalization initiative on the Ohio ballot in 2015. The initiative sought exclusive grow rights for the group members while prohibiting all other cultivation except small amounts for personal use. Lachey appeared in a TV ad advocating for passage of the initiative, but it was ultimately defeated.

Lachey is on the Entertainment Council of the hunger-relief organization Feeding America.

In 2021, Lachey competed on season five of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Piglet&quot;. He was declared the winner of the season.

==Personal life==

In December 1998, Lachey and fellow singer Jessica Simpson were introduced by their shared manager at a Christmas event. They subsequently began dating after meeting again at a &quot;Teen People&quot; event in January 1999, but broke up for five months beginning in April 2001 until getting back together following the September 11 attacks. They became engaged in February 2002, and married on October 26, 2002, in Austin, Texas. In November 2005, after months of tabloid speculation, Lachey and Simpson announced they were separating. Simpson filed for divorce on December 16, 2005, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The couple&#x27;s divorce was highly publicized worldwide and was reportedly finalized on June 30, 2006.

Soon after the release of &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot;, Lachey&#x27;s 2006 music video starring Vanessa Minnillo, he and Minnillo began dating. They briefly broke up in June 2009, but had reunited by October 2009. Lachey and Minnillo became engaged in November 2010, and married on July 15, 2011, on Sir Richard Branson&#x27;s private Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. The wedding was filmed and televised on TLC. They have three children, born in September 2012, January 2015, and December 2016.

<doc id="762779" wikidata="Q1112475" url="?curid=762779" title="Horizon (British TV series)">
<text>Horizon is an ongoing and long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy.

==History==
The programme was first broadcast on 2 May 1964 with &quot;The World of Buckminster Fuller&quot;, which explored the theories and structures of inventor Richard Buckminster Fuller and included the &quot;Horizon&quot; mission statement: &quot;The aim of &quot;Horizon&quot; is to provide a platform from which some of the world&#x27;s greatest scientists and philosophers can communicate their curiosity, observations and reflections, and infuse into our common knowledge their changing views of the universe&quot;. &quot;Horizon&quot; continues to be broadcast on BBC Two, and in 2009 added a series of films based on the rich &quot;Horizon&quot; archive, called &quot;Horizon Guides&quot;, on BBC Four.

In December 2016, it was announced that &quot;Horizon&quot; would no longer be made exclusively by the BBC&#x27;s in-house production division, BBC Studios, and the BBC invited independent production companies to pitch to make episodes of the strand.

==Episodes==

There have been 57 series and more than 1,200 episodes produced.

==Broad coverage of science topics==
&quot;Horizon&quot; has investigated an eclectic mix of subjects and controversial topics. It opened the awareness of consumers to the use of whale meat in pet food in 1972 (&quot;Whales, Dolphins, and Men&quot;), and produced award-winning documentary-dramas such as &quot;Life Story&quot; in 1987, which dramatised the discovery of the structure of DNA. A 1978 programme about the silicon chip documented the decline of the Swiss watch industry. In 1993, an Emmy-winning episode about decreasing male fertility (&quot;Assault on the Male&quot;) was given a special screening at the White House.

== Format ==
The format of the series has varied over the years.

===1960s–1980s===
The first ever &quot;Horizon&quot; was &quot;The World of Buckminster Fuller&quot;, produced and directed by Ramsay Short, was shown on 5 February 1964. It set the style; running time 50 minutes, no in-vision presenter, interviewees speaking off camera (in practice, almost always to the producer/director whose questions were usually edited out). Until the 1980s &quot;Horizon&quot;, in common with all BBC documentaries, was shot on 16 mm film. Only rare programmes had a specialist writer – in most cases the producer/director was also the writer.

The first &quot;Horizon&quot; in colour was &quot;Koestler on Creativity&quot;, produced by Robert Vas, was shown on 5 December 1967.

The Public Broadcasting Service&#x27;s (PBS) &quot;Nova&quot; series was created in 1974, after Michael Ambrosino, who had served a year-long fellowship with the BBC, was inspired to create an American program based on the same model.

===1990s===
Since the early 1990s, &quot;Horizon&quot; has developed a distinctive narrative form, typically employing an underlying &quot;detective&quot; metaphor, to relate scientific issues and discoveries to the lives of its viewers. Many episodes of &quot;Horizon&quot; are structured in a format that starts with a tease or menu laying out what the show has in store, followed by two &quot;acts&quot; with a &quot;plot twist&quot; around 25–35 minutes into the show. The twist frequently propels the story line from a focus on an individual scientist&#x27;s human and intellectual journey of discovery through to explore the impact of that insight while, at the same time, providing a change of &quot;texture&quot; and filmic pace. Often, episodes of &quot;Horizon&quot; end up with a montage of &quot;talking heads&quot; as experts and people affected by the implications of the science covered are intercut to create a sense of summary.

===2000s===
Until early 2008, the length was standardised at 50 minutes, which was extended in the latter half of 2008 to 60 minutes. Some episodes are adapted from documentaries by other broadcasters such as PBS&#x27;s &quot;Nova&quot;, and episodes of &quot;Horizon&quot; are in turn adapted by PBS (to American English) and other broadcasters around the world in their own languages.

No new episodes were broadcast between July 2022 and 2024. In January 2024, a special episode on the Artemis program in conjunction with the American series &quot;Nova&quot; and the Open University was announced.

==Popularity==
&quot;Horizon&quot; has enjoyed high viewing figures, even though it covered subjects as complex as molecular biology and particle physics. It has shown a change of direction since June 2006, offering a more light-hearted approach, though the subjects it covers remain serious. For instance, an episode broadcast in 2019 entitled &quot;We Need To Talk About Death&quot; features Kevin Fong talking to palliative care clinician Mark Taubert and some of his patients who are facing terminal illness.

==Criticism==
The down-side to &quot;Horizon&quot;″s recent focus on &quot;Pure Science, Sheer Drama&quot; and the occasionally forced narrative this engenders has led to some accusations of dumbing down in recent years, with one former editor writing a newspaper article about how the programme concentrates too much on human stories, and not enough on the science.

One programme &quot;Chimps are people too&quot; was entirely presented by a non-scientist, Danny Wallace. Editor Andrew Cohen addressed the reasons why the programme went down this route on the &quot;Horizon&quot; web page.

In October 2014, a three-part special – &quot;Cat Watch: the New Horizon Experiment&quot; – was broadcast, following up on &quot;Horizon&quot;″s 2013 &quot;The Secret Life of the Cat&quot;. At the end of the first hour-long broadcast the findings of the experiment so-far were summarised on screen by presenter Liz Bonnin as: &quot;Our cats can cope with change but you have to introduce them to it gently&quot;. &quot;Private Eye&quot; was critical of the scientific value of the programme saying: &quot;By all means, if the BBC wants to, make a series called &quot;The Secret Life of Cats&quot;; but don&#x27;t insult the history of television by branding it, however obliquely, as a &quot;Horizon&quot;&quot;.

==Awards==

In the period of &quot;Pure Science, Sheer Drama&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot; won an unprecedented series of the world&#x27;s top awards, including a BAFTA, an Emmy for Best Documentary, a Royal Television Society Award and a Grierson Trust Award. Other Emmy winning programmes are: &quot;Chernobyl&#x27;s Sarcophagus&quot; (1991), &quot;Assault on the Male&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Fall of the World Trade Centre&quot; (2003). In 1988, &quot;Horizon&quot; won a BAFTA for Best Drama, &quot;Life Story&quot; (about the elucidation of the structure of DNA), another in 1996 for Best Documentary, &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot; (which also won a Prix Italia) and another in 2001 for Best Factual Series or Strand.

==Home media==
Three &quot;Horizon&quot; episodes were included on The Wonders Collection Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray. The episodes were &quot;Do You Know What Time It Is?&quot;, &quot;Can We Make A Star On Earth?&quot; and &quot;What on Earth is Wrong With Gravity?&quot;

<doc id="762794" wikidata="Q4111625" url="?curid=762794" title="Rainforest Action Network">
<text>Rainforest Action Network (RAN) is an environmental organization based in San Francisco, California, United States. The organization was founded by Randy &quot;Hurricane&quot; Hayes and Mike Roselle in 1985, and first gained national prominence with a grassroots organizing campaign that in 1987 succeeded in convincing Burger King to cancel $31 million worth of destructive Central American rainforest beef contracts. Protecting forests and challenging corporate power has remained a key focus of RAN’s campaigns since, and has led RAN into campaigns that have led to transformative policy changes across home building, wood purchasing and supplying, automobile, fashion, paper and banking industries.

==History==
Rainforest Action Network was founded in San Francisco, California in 1985 by Mike Roselle and Randy &quot;Hurricane&quot; Hayes. Early on, RAN worked with Herbert Chao Gunther, the founder of the Public Media Center in San Francisco, a marketing firm exclusively on social justice and environmental issues. This partnership with Gunther included new branding and campaigns against large multinational corporations in the 1990s, using grassroots activism and savvy media work. They gained national prominence with a grassroots organizing campaign that in 1987 succeeded in convincing Burger King to cancel $31 million worth of destructive Central American rainforest beef contracts.

In 1989, RAN called for a boycott of products and services from Mitsubishi and companies owned by Mitsubishi—including Kirin beer and Nikon cameras—because at the time, Mitsubishi was involved in rainforest destruction through its forestry activities; in 1996, Mitsubishi Motors America and Mitsubishi Electric America facilitated negotiations between RAN activists and Mitsubishi executives which resulted in an end to this boycott in 1998.

Along with Global Exchange and the Ruckus Society, RAN played a central role in organizing the 1999 mass actions against the WTO (World Trade Organization) summit in Seattle. Although the organization once had RAGS (Rainforest Action Groups) around the country, today its operations are centralized in San Francisco.

RAN&#x27;s executive director, Rebecca Tarbotton, drowned on December 26, 2012, at age 39, while swimming in the Pacific Ocean. Lindsey Allen was subsequently named executive director on August 21, 2013. Allen departed RAN in 2019 and on February 10, 2020, the board elected Ginger Cassady as the new Executive Director.

== About ==

===Organizational mission===
Rainforest Action Network preserves forests, protects the climate and upholds human rights by challenging corporate power and systemic injustice through frontline partnerships and strategic campaigns.

===Activities and structure===
RAN drives change through grassroots organizing, media stunts, the use of non-violent civil disobedience, and inside-the-boardroom negotiations to confront and positively influence industry-leading corporations to publicly adopt environmental policies that address issues ranging from deforestation to climate change. Their corporate campaigning strategies have prompted a number of academic case studies reflecting on the relationship between activists and businesses. RAN works in close alliance with an increasingly well coordinated movement of NGOs (non-governmental organizations).

The organization&#x27;s board of directors includes André Carothers; Anna Hawken McKay; Allan Badiner, Anna Lappé of the Small Planet Institute; and James Gollin, board president and a founding member of the Social Venture Network. Honorary members of RAN&#x27;s board include Ali MacGraw, Bob Weir, Bonnie Raitt, Chris Noth, John Densmore and Woody Harrelson.

==Programs==

===Tropical Forests Program===
RAN’s Tropical Forests Program focuses on stopping rainforest deforestation and degradation and the oppression of forest peoples in Indonesia. As a result of deforestation and the destruction of peatland for the agribusiness and pulp and paper industries, Indonesia is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

====Rainforest Agribusiness: palm oil====

RAN&#x27;s Rainforest Agribusiness campaign, The Problem With Palm Oil, centers around the social and environmental impact of palm oil plantations in the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. Palm oil plantations in these areas result in the clearcutting of tropical hardwoods, the killing of local wildlife, the displacement of local communities and a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The campaign’s main target has been Cargill, a privately owned agribusiness company and the largest supplier of palm oil to the United States. While still applying pressure to Cargill, in 2010 RAN began campaigning for responsible use of palm oil by food production giant General Mills through direct action tactics, negotiation and membership engagement; eight months later General Mills issued a strong palm oil policy and committed to getting all of its palm oil from responsible sources by 2015. The campaign simultaneously collaborated with teenagers Madison Vorva and Rhiannon Tomtishen to help them in their campaign to make Girl Scout Cookies palm-oil free. The two young women were awarded the prestigious Brower Youth Award for their work.

===Energy and Finance program===
The Energy and Finance campaign targets financial institutions involved in the financing of destructive forestry and fossil fuels projects. Historically, the campaign has succeeded in obtaining strong environmental policies from banks such as Citi, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and others. Currently, the campaign focuses on discouraging banks&#x27; financing of coal projects, and especially mountaintop removal mining (MTR), principally within the United States. This form of surface mining uses millions of tons of explosives to blow apart mountain peaks in order to access the coal seam below. According to Rainforest Action Network, eight of nine banks that previously funded MTR have now established policies and criteria to restrict their funding of this devastating form of coal mining. Beginning in the Fall of 2011, the Energy and Finance Program has been campaigning to move Bank of America, whom they name as the leading US financier of the coal industry, to divest from their coal investments and invest in renewable energy sources.

===We Can Change Chevron: toxic waste oil===
Launched in December 2009, the We Can Change Chevron campaign targets the California-based oil corporation for their subsidiary Texaco&#x27;s dumping of of waste oil into the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. We Can Change Chevron aims to pressure Chevron into paying for the cleanup of the waste oil pits abandoned by their subsidiary, and to develop an environmental and human rights policy that will prevent future scenarios like this from occurring in the future. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001, and asserts that Texaco completed its agreement to clean up its share of the waste generated by the joint venture between Texaco and Petroecuador, the state run oil company. The company claims it cleaned up one third of the waste, more than its share of the agreement with Petroecuador, and the rest of the responsibility lies with the state who has had sole ownership of the oil fields since 1992. The case resulted in a historic ruling against the oil giant, who was ordered to pay $18 billion in damages to the plaintiffs. After an appeal by Chevron, the judgement was upheld by an Ecuadorian court in January 2012.

==Controversies==
In 2003, the RAN organization was subpoenaed by the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means to hand over every document and piece of footage relating to all protests the organization participated in since 1993, in order to investigate whether they should be entitled to the tax-exempt status. The organization’s then-Executive Director Michael Brune labeled this investigation &quot;the latest attempt to intimidate RAN&#x27;s supporters, and a part of a larger and more disturbing effort by corporate interests to stifle dissent and control free speech.&quot;

The organization has come under fire from environmentalists opposed to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for its membership in that group, though RAN maintains that their engagement is necessary to push for stronger protection of forests and the rights of forest communities by the FSC.

<doc id="762798" wikidata="Q167334" url="?curid=762798" title="Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem">
<text>There were six major officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem: the constable, the marshal, the seneschal, the chamberlain (which were known as the &quot;Grand Offices&quot;), the butler and the chancellor. At certain times there were also bailiffs, viscounts and castellans. 

Essentially these offices developed from the typical officials that existed in northern France in the 11th century, the homeland of the first kings of Jerusalem. The offices continued to develop in France and England, but in Jerusalem they tended to develop more slowly or not at all, taking on different roles than their European counterparts.

The lists given below are incomplete, as the specific names and dates of the officers are sometimes unknown. After the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the offices were sometimes awarded as honors by the kings of Cyprus and Jerusalem.

== Constable ==
The constable commanded the army, paid mercenaries and judged legal cases pertaining to the military. He was the most important officer in the kingdom, due to the almost constant state of warfare that existed between the Christian and Muslim states. The constable was officially the second-in-command of the army, in which he exercised police authority and commanded a division twice as large as all others. In addition, constables also determined the boundaries and borders of the kingdom. During the coronation the constable would hold the king&#x27;s horse.

*Simon (1108–1115)
*Hugh Caulis (c. 1120)
*Eustace Grenier (c. 1123-1123)
*William I of Bures (1123–1141?)
*Manasses of Hierges (1144–1151)
*Humphrey II of Toron (1152–1179)
*Amalric of Lusignan (1179–1194)
*John of Ibelin (1194–1205)
*Walter of Montbéliard (1206–1211)
*Odo of Montbéliard (1220–1244)
*Philip of Montfort (c. 1244)
*John of Ibelin (1251–1258)
*William of Botron (1258–1262)
*Balian of Arsuf (1268–1277)
*Richard of Neublans (c. 1277)
*Simon of Montolif (c. 1284?)
*Baldwin of Ibelin (c. 1286)
*Amalric of Lusignan (1285–1300)
*Philip of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (c. 1359?)
*Peter of Lusignan (c. 1415?)

== Marshal ==
The marshal was next-in-command (and, apparently, a literal vassal) to the constable. He led the mercenaries and was in charge of the army&#x27;s horses, and distributed the spoils of a victorious battle. On coronation day the marshal would assist the constable.

*Sado (1125–1154)
*Eudes of St. Amand (1155–1156)
*Joscelin III of Edessa (1156–1159)
*William (1159–1171)
*Gerard of Pugi (1169–1174)
*John (c. 1179)
*Gerard of Ridefort (c. 1179)
*Walter Durus (1185–1192)
*Hugh Martin (c. 1191)
*Arnulf (c. 1193)
*John (1194–1200)
*Aymar de Lairon (c. 1206)
*James of Dournai (1211–1217)
*Riccardo Filangieri (1231–1242)
*Philip of Cossie (c. 1250)
*Geoffrey of Sergines (c. 1254)
*John of Gibelet (1261–1262)
*William Canet (1269–1273)
*James Vidal (c. 1277)

== Seneschal ==
The office of seneschal in Jerusalem never achieved the prominence of its European counterparts but was important nonetheless. The seneschal administered the coronation ceremony, oversaw the Haute Cour in the king&#x27;s absence, administered royal castles, and managed the royal finances and revenue. The seneschal&#x27;s power was over only viscounts and not castellans, and the constable was still superior to the seneschal due in part to the kingdom&#x27;s constant state of war. During coronations the seneschal would hold the royal sceptre and oversee the coronation feast. 

The office was similar to, but not as developed as, the English office of the exchequer.

*Hugh of St. Omer (c. 1100–1104)
*Gervase of Bazoches (c. 1104)
*Hugo Chostard (c. 1112)
*Anscherius (c. 1122?)
*Isaac (c. 1149)
*John (c. 1151)
*Guy of Milly (c. 1164)
*Miles of Plancy (c. 1168–1174)
*&quot;Ralph (c. 1176)&quot;
*Joscelin III of Edessa (1176–1190)
*&quot;Obertus Nepos (1187–1192?)&quot;, possibly only personal under Conrad of Montferrat
*Ralph of Tiberias (1194–1220)
*Raymond of Gibelet (c. 1240)
*Baldwin of Ibelin (c. 1256)
*Geoffrey of Sergines (1254–1267?)
*Robert of Cresque (c. 1269)
*Olivier de Termes (1269)
*Jean I de Grailly (1272–1276)
*Odo Poilechien (1278–1286)
*Philip of Ibelin (?–?)

== Chamberlain ==
The chamberlain administered the royal household and its servants, and had other honorary duties such as administering oaths. On coronation day the chamberlain would robe the king. He had his own fief from which he drew his salary.

*Strabulon (c. 1099)
*Geoffrey (c. 1099)
*Gerard (1108–1115)
*John (1119–1128)
*Ralph (1129–1130)
*Joscelin (c. 1138)
*Miles (c. 1138)
*Nicholas (1150–1152)
*Gauvain de la Roche (c. 1156)
*Gerard of Pugi (c. 1169)
*Amalric of Lusignan (1175–1178)
*John (c. 1179)
*Raymond (c. 1184)
*Balian of Ibelin (1183–1185)
*Thomas (1190–1197)
*Henry of Canelli (c. 1192)
*John (c. 1194)
*Rohard of Caiphas (1201–1220)
*Renaud of Caiphas (1230–1232)
*John of Cossie (1232–1250)
*Philip of Cossie (1250–1269)

== Butler ==
The butler was in charge of the royal table and also administered the kingdom&#x27;s vineyards.

*Winric (c. 1099)
*Gervais (c. 1107)
*Pagan (1120–1136)
*Robert Crispin (1145–1146)
*Odo of St Amand (1164–1167)
*Miles (1185–1186)

== Chancellor ==
The chancellor drew up deeds and charters and managed the kingdom&#x27;s diplomatic service. The chancellery is an interesting example of the fossilization of 11th century offices. It consisted of only a few secretaries and scribes, and never became the large administrative bureaucracy that had developed elsewhere in Europe. Chancellors tended to be clergymen who often became bishops or archbishops, sometimes while still holding the chancellery. The relative unimportance of the chancellor reflects the relative decentralization of royal authority as compared to states like France or England that were at the same time becoming more centralized.

*Arnoul (?–?)
*Pagan (1115–1128)
*Amelinus (c. 1130)
*Franco (1133–1135?)
*Helias (1136–1142)
*Ralph, bishop of Bethlehem (1146–1174)
*Frederick, Archbishop of Tyre (c. 1150)
*William, archbishop of Tyre (1174–1183)
*Lambert (c. 1177)
*Bandinus (for Conrad of Montferrat (&quot;de jure&quot; Conrad I from 1190), in Tyre) (1188–1192)
*Peter, bishop of Tripoli (1185–1192)
*Eudes (c. 1190)
*Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre (1192–1200)
*Raoul of Mérencourt (1206–1215)
*Simon of Maugastel (1226–1227)
*Maregnan (c. 1234)

== Bailiff ==

The bailiff (or &quot;bailli&quot;) administered the kingdom in the absence or minority of the king, in the capacity of a regent; for example, during the captivity of Baldwin II, and the youth and illness of Baldwin IV. In the 13th century the bailiff ruled essentially as a king himself, and was the most powerful man in the kingdom, as the kings were usually foreign monarchs who did not live permanently in the kingdom.

*Eustace Grenier (1123)
*William I of Bures (1123–1124)
*Miles of Plancy (1173)
*Raymond III of Tripoli (1173–1177)
*Raynald of Châtillon (1177)
*Guy of Lusignan (1183–1185)
*Raymond III of Tripoli (1186)
*John of Ibelin (1206–1210)
*Odo of Montbéliard (1223–1227)
*Thomas of Aquino (1227–1228)

*Jean Fuinon (1248–1249)
*John of Arsuf (1249–1254)
*John of Ibelin (1254–1256)
*John of Arsuf (1256–1258)
*Geoffrey of Sergines (1259–1261)
*Balian of Ibelin (1276–1277)
*Roger of San Severino (1277–1281)
*Odo Poilechien (1281–1286)
*Baldwin of Ibelin (1286–1287)

== Viscount and castellan ==
These two offices were sometimes held by one person and sometimes held by two separate people; sometimes one or the other was not held at all. They were named by the king and occupied the Tower of David, but their specific duties are mostly unknown and were probably not particularly important; one of the duties of the viscount was apprehending criminals and administering justice in the lower-class burgess court. Like the office of butler, these offices may not have survived the move to Acre.

*Anselm (castellan, c. 1110)
*Pisellus (viscount, c. 1110)
*Anscatinus (viscount, 1120–1135?)

<doc id="762801" wikidata="Q7720651" url="?curid=762801" title="The Burkiss Way">
<text>The Burkiss Way is a BBC Radio 4 sketch comedy series, originally broadcast between August 1976 and November 1980. It was written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, with additional material in series 1 and 2 by John Mason, Colin Bostock-Smith, Douglas Adams, John Lloyd, Tom Magee Englefield and Liz Pollock.

The first series of the show starred Denise Coffey, Chris Emmett, Nigel Rees and Fred Harris. From series 2 onwards the show starred Jo Kendall, Chris Emmett, Nigel Rees and Fred Harris. The series had three producers, announced as &quot;Simon Brett of Stepney&quot;, &quot;John Lloyd of Europe&quot; and &quot;David &#x27;Hatch of the BBC&#x27; Hatch&quot;.

The show&#x27;s humour was based on surrealism and literary and media parodies, sprinkled with puns.

==Format==
The series had its roots in two half-hour sketch shows entitled &quot;Half-Open University&quot; which Marshall and Renwick had written with Mason for Radio 3 as a parody of Open University programmes. The first, broadcast on 25 August 1975, spoofed science, the second, on 1 January 1976 and repeated on 1 December that year, history.

In a similar vein, &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; was styled around fictional correspondence courses by &quot;Professor Emil Burkiss&quot; entitled &quot;The Burkiss Way to Dynamic Living&quot;, and each episode or &quot;lesson&quot; had a number and a title based on one of the course&#x27;s subjects: &quot;Lesson 1: Peel Bananas the Burkiss Way&quot;, &quot;Lesson 2: Pass Examinations the Burkiss Way&quot; and so on. Although the numbers and titles were maintained throughout the run, a significant change of style early in the second series saw the radio correspondence course become a hook rather than a narrative device, and it was mentioned only in passing.

From here on the programme continued in a more conventional sketch format, though it was to use increasingly Pythonesque devices including surreal, stream-of-consciousness linking, back-referencing and aggregation. Like the Pythons before them, the writers lampooned and tinkered with the medium on which the show was broadcast, including spoofs of Radio 4&#x27;s continuity style. Many later episodes had false endings, sometimes disguised as genuine continuity announcements. The opening and closing credits might be anywhere within the show. One show ran backwards from the closing to the opening credits, whilst another was allegedly dropped, broken and glued together with a tube of BBC coffee, resulting in disjointed running order with many sketches beginning and ending in mid-sentence. For one pair of shows, one sentence was split over two programmes, with &quot;Eric ...&quot; ending lesson 37 and &quot;... Pode of Croydon&quot; starting lesson 38.

As time went on the show became increasingly surreal and in several sketches the writers seemed to see how many strange ideas they could cram into a sketch. For example, one later episode contains a sketch about an amoeba employed by the Department of Civil Service Staff Recruitment and Fisheries as a token Desmond Dekker and the Aces but who keeps reproducing asexually by mitosis while singing a Lee Dorsey song.

==Contributors==
In the first series Chris Emmett made several appearances as a dirty old man; in episode 2, his character became prime minister thanks to the &quot;Burkiss Way&quot;. The fourth episode of series one, &quot;Solve Murders the Burkiss Way&quot;, featured the voice as &quot;Eric Pode of Croydon&quot; as a disguise of mass-murderess &quot;Beatrice Crint of Chingford&quot;. The same voice was used in the next episode, &quot;Keep Unfit the Burkiss Way&quot;, as &quot;Ron Pode of Hackney&quot; and from series 2 this voice resumed as Eric Pode of Croydon, becoming one of the show&#x27;s few recurring characters and the only one not a parody of a real person. He is a man with unsavoury habits, inspired by &quot;Round the Horne&#x27;s&quot; &quot;J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock&quot;. Each week he is interviewed by Fred Harris&#x27;s character, who calls him Mister Croydon, is disgusted by his habits and puns, and always remarks, &quot;isn&#x27;t he a panic&quot;. This was one of the show&#x27;s two catchphrases, the other being &quot;there will now be a short intermission&quot;. There was usually a series of linked sketches through each episode, the intermission sketches providing a break.

The fact that Douglas Adams had written for the show did not prevent his becoming a target for satire. He was parodied as Mister Different Adams whose catchphrase is &quot;I see comedy as a kind of...&quot;. Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was also a target; the 1979 Christmas show (&quot;Eric Pode of Croydon&#x27;s Easter Special&quot;) closes with Peter Jones as his HHGTTG character, &quot;The Book&quot;, attempting to vilify BBC Radio 4 for broadcasting &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;, but in typical fashion, he is cut off in mid-sentence.

==Broadcast history==

&quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; ran to 47 episodes in six series, but the episode and series numbering are derailed by &quot;Lesson 31&quot; and &quot;Lesson 32&quot;, which are a single episode masquerading as two half-episodes, the first of which ends series 3 and the second of which begins series 4. There are two &quot;Lesson 39&quot;s, both entitled &quot;Repeat Yourself the Burkiss Way&quot;, which have identical beginnings. The consequence is that &quot;Lesson 33&quot; to the first &quot;Lesson 39&quot; inclusive have lesson numbers that are one greater than the cumulative number; from the second &quot;Lesson 39&quot; onward the correct numbering is restored. (The second Lesson 39 is never broadcast today as, although it was certainly not written with that intention, the last 5-6 minutes are now seen as very racist.) 

A sketch in Lesson 28 featuring unsubtle references to newscaster Reginald Bosanquet&#x27;s alcoholism was cut following the first broadcast and was never reinstated. The last episode was cut short by 6 minutes on its first repeat transmission, on the instructions of the controller of BBC Radio 4. The missing material lampooned the grovelling approach of Radio 4 to the Queen Mother&#x27;s 80th birthday celebrations. Repeats on BBC7 remained censored until a restored version was first broadcast in &quot;Celebrate The Burkiss Way&quot; on BBC7 on Saturday 4 April 2009.

The show gained a cult following and has several reruns on BBC 7 / BBC Radio 4 Extra. Listeners complained about some omissions, which may indicate that episodes have been lost or wiped – notably Lesson 6 – and episodes 7 to 27 inclusive have been broadcast in mono, suggesting the original stereo masters were wiped. The suggestion is, however, false as the BBC is known to have all episodes in its archive, though it is unusual for the early shows to be made in stereo and then some later shows to be only in mono. Lesson 6 is unique in being only 15 minutes long, which makes it difficult to accommodate in R4 Extra&#x27;s schedule.

==Episode list==

† Lessons 31 and 32 were in fact a single 30-minute show masquerading as two 15-minute episodes.

‡ The two lessons numbered 39 with identical titles were different, but started exactly the same way. 

Because of these anomalies, all of the episodes between Lesson 33 and the first Lesson 39 have lesson numbers that are one greater than the actual half-hour episode numeration.

==Releases and other media==

A book, &quot;Bestseller! The Life and Death of Eric Pode of Croydon&quot;, was published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1981, loosely based on sketches from the series.

A BBC Radio Collection in 1994 contained excerpts rather than complete episodes.

A BBC Radio Collection in 2010 contained the complete first series.

==Reception==
In his 1981 book, &quot;Laughter in the Air: An Informal History of British Radio Comedy&quot;, Barry Took described &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; as &quot;an irreverent, surreal romp through the conscious and unconscious mind&quot; and, on presenting extracts from the scripts, wrote &quot;you really need a full half-hour to absorb the constant shifts of attitude and changes of direction.&quot;

In 2018, Rob Grant claimed he &quot;really admired &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;,&quot; saying &quot;it was a terrifically funny show and I loved it.&quot;

<text>Gamaliel the Elder (; also spelled Gamliel; &quot;Rabban Gamlīʾēl hazZāqēn&quot;; &quot;Gamaliēl ho Presbýteros&quot;), or Rabban Gamaliel I, was a leading authority in the Sanhedrin in the early first century CE. He was the son of Simeon ben Hillel and grandson of the great Jewish teacher Hillel the Elder. He fathered Simeon ben Gamliel, who was named for Gamaliel&#x27;s father, and a daughter, who married a priest named Simon ben Nathanael.
In the Christian tradition, Gamaliel is recognized as a Pharisaic doctor of Jewish Law. Gamaliel was named as a member of the Sanhedrin in the fifth chapter of Acts and the teacher of Paul the Apostle in . Gamaliel encouraged his fellow Pharisees to show leniency to the apostles of Jesus in .

In the Talmud, Gamaliel is described as bearing the titles Nasi (Hebrew: נָשִׂיא &quot;Nāśīʾ&quot; &quot;prince&quot;) and &quot;Rabban&quot; (&quot;our master&quot;) as the president of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; it is not doubted that he held a senior position in the highest court in Jerusalem. 
Gamaliel holds a reputation in the Mishnah for being one of the greatest teachers in all the annals of Judaism: &quot;Since Rabban Gamaliel the Elder died, there has been no more reverence for the law, and purity and piety died out at the same time&quot;.

Gamaliel&#x27;s authority on questions of religious law is suggested by two Mishnaic anecdotes in which &quot;the king and queen&quot; ask for his advice about rituals. The identity of the king and queen in question is not given, but is generally thought to either be Herod Agrippa and his wife Cypros the Nabataean, or Herod Agrippa II and his sister Berenice.

As rabbinic literature always contrasts the school of Hillel the Elder to that of Shammai and only presents the collective opinions of each of these opposing schools of thought without mentioning the individual nuances and views of the rabbis within them, these texts do not portray Gamaliel as being knowledgeable about the Jewish scriptures, nor do they describe him as a teacher. For this reason, Gamaliel is not listed as part of the chain of individuals who perpetuated the Mishnaic tradition. Instead, the chain is listed as passing directly from Hillel to Yohanan ben Zakkai.

Nevertheless, the Mishnah mentions Gamaliel&#x27;s authorship of a few laws about community welfare and conjugal rights. He argued that the law should protect women during divorce and that, for the purpose of remarriage, a single witness was sufficient evidence for the death of a husband.

Various pieces of classical rabbinic literature additionally mention that Gamaliel sent out three epistles, designed as notifications of new religious rulings, and which portray Gamaliel as the head of the Jewish body for religious law. Two of these three were sent, respectively, to the inhabitants of Galilee and &quot;the Darom&quot; (southern Judea), and were on the subject of the first tithe. The third epistle was sent to the Jews of the diaspora and argued for the introduction of an intercalary month.
Since the Hillelian school of thought is presented collectively, very few other teachings are clearly identifiable as Gamaliel&#x27;s. There is only a cryptic dictum comparing his students to classes of fish:

: A ritually impure fish: one who has memorized everything by study, but has no understanding, and is the son of poor parents
: A ritually pure fish: one who has learnt and understood everything, and is the son of rich parents
: A fish from the Jordan River: one who has learnt everything, but doesn&#x27;t know how to respond
: A fish from the Mediterranean Sea: one who has learnt everything, and knows how to respond

In some manuscripts of Dunash ibn Tamim&#x27;s tenth-century Hebrew commentary on the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, the author identifies Gamaliel with the physician Galen. He claims to have seen an Arabic medical work translated from Hebrew entitled &quot;The Book of Gamaliel the Prince (Nasi), called Galenos among the Greeks&quot;. However, since Galen lived in the second century and Gamaliel died during the mid-first century, this is unlikely.

===Quotes===
In &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;, Gamaliel is credited as saying:
== In the New Testament and in Apocrypha ==
The Acts of the Apostles introduces Gamaliel as a Pharisee and celebrated doctor of the Mosaic Law in . In the larger context (vs.), Peter and the other apostles are described as being prosecuted before the Sanhedrin for continuing to preach the gospel despite the Jewish authorities having previously prohibited it. The passage describes Gamaliel as presenting an argument against executing the apostles, reminding them about the previous revolts of Theudas and Judas of Galilee, which had collapsed quickly after the deaths of those individuals. Gamaliel&#x27;s advice was accepted after his concluding argument:

The Book of Acts later goes on to describe Paul the Apostle recounting that though &quot;born in Tarsus&quot;, he was brought up in Jerusalem &quot;at the feet of Gamaliel, &quot;[and]&quot; taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers&quot; (). No details are given about which teachings Paul adopted from Gamaliel, as it is assumed that as a Pharisee, Paul was already recognized in the community at that time as a devout Jew. Also, how much Gamaliel influenced aspects of Christianity is unmentioned. However, there is no other record of Gamaliel ever having taught in public, but the Talmud does describe Gamaliel as teaching a student who displayed &quot;impudence in learning&quot;, which a few scholars identify as a possible reference to Paul. The relationship of Paul the Apostle and Judaism continues to be the subject of scholarly debate. Helmut Koester, Professor of Divinity and Ecclesiastical History at Harvard University, questions if Paul studied under Gamaliel at all, arguing that there is a marked contrast in the tolerance that Gamaliel is said to have expressed toward Christianity with the &quot;murderous rage&quot; against Christians that Paul is described as having before his conversion (). However, Richard Bauckham, a scholar at Ridley Hall at Cambridge, argues that Paul was indeed connected to Gamaliel. 

===Alleged Gospel of Gamaliel===
The &quot;Gospel of Gamaliel&quot; is a hypothetical book speculated to exist by some scholars, perhaps a part of Pilate apocrypha. While no ancient sources directly refer to such a gospel, Paulin Ladeuze and Carl Anton Baumstark first proposed that such a book existed in 1906. Scholars who believe such a book once existed have reconstructed it from a homily, the &quot;Lament of Mary&quot; (&quot;Laha Maryam&quot;) by a bishop named Cyriacus. They believe &quot;Laha Maryam&quot; extensively quotes the Gospel of Gamaliel; the Lament includes a section that leads with &quot;I, Gamaliel&quot;, which caused speculation that these sections were actually quoting an existing gospel. Other scholars believe such inference that the author was &quot;plagiarizing&quot; a lost gospel is unwarranted, and these sections are simply written by Cyriacus from the perspective of Gamaliel.

Reasonably complete manuscripts of &quot;Laha Maryam&quot; exist in both Ge&#x27;ez and Garshuni versions. Regardless of whether &quot;Laha Maryam&quot; is quoting a lost gospel, Gamaliel does feature in it. He witnesses a miracle of healing in raising a dead man at Jesus&#x27;s tomb; Jesus&#x27;s abandoned grave cloths have miraculous powers. Gamaliel also talks with Pontius Pilate, who is portrayed highly positively as a Christian himself.

===Veneration===
Ecclesiastical tradition claims that Gamaliel had embraced the Christian faith, and his tolerant attitude toward early Christians is explained by this. According to Photios I of Constantinople, he was baptised by Saint Peter and John the Apostle, together with his son Abibon (Abibo, Abibas, Abibus) and Nicodemus. The Clementine Literature suggested that he maintained secrecy about the conversion and continued to be a member of the Sanhedrin to assist his fellow Christians covertly. Some scholars consider the traditions to be spurious, and the passage in which Gamaliel is mentioned does not state that he became a Christian either implicitly or explicitly.

The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Gamaliel as a saint, and he is commemorated on August 2, the date when tradition holds that his relics were found, along with those of Stephen the Protomartyr, Abibon (Gamaliel&#x27;s son), and Nicodemus. The traditional liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church celebrates the same feast day of the finding of the relics on August 3. It is said that in the fifth century, his body had been discovered and taken to Pisa Cathedral by a miracle.

Gamaliel is referred to in the 15th-century Catalan document, &quot;Acts of Llàtzer&quot;.

<doc id="762804" wikidata="Q7458483" url="?curid=762804" title="Sex assignment">
<text>Sex assignment (also known as gender assignment) is the discernment of an infant&#x27;s sex, typically made at birth based on an examination of the baby&#x27;s external genitalia by a healthcare provider such as a midwife, nurse, or physician. In the vast majority of cases (99.95%), sex is assigned unambiguously at birth. However, in about 1 in 2000 births, the baby&#x27;s genitalia may not clearly indicate male or female, necessitating additional diagnostic steps, and deferring sex assignment. 

In most countries the healthcare provider&#x27;s determination, along with other details of the birth, is by law recorded on an official document and submitted to the government for later issuance of a birth certificate and for other legal purposes.

The prevalence of intersex conditions, where a baby&#x27;s sex characteristics do not conform strictly to typical definitions of male or female, ranges between 0.018% and 1.7%. While some intersex conditions result in genital ambiguity (approximately 0.02% to 0.05% of births), others present genitalia that are distinctly male or female, which may delay the recognition of an intersex condition until later in life. 

Societally and medically, it is generally assumed that a person&#x27;s gender identity will align with the sex assigned at birth, making them cisgender. However, for a minority, assigned sex and gender identity do not coincide, leading to transgender identity experiences. When assigning sex to intersex individuals, some healthcare providers may consider the gender identity that most people with a similar intersex condition develop, although such assignments may be revised as the individual matures.

The use of surgical or hormonal interventions to reinforce sex assignments in intersex individuals without informed consent is considered a violation of human rights, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

==Terminology==
Sex assignment refers to the identification of an infant&#x27;s sex at birth, typically based on observable physical characteristics. This is also known as gender assignment.

In clinical and medical contexts, terms such as &quot;birth-assigned sex&quot; or &quot;birth-assigned gender&quot; are used to describe the sex identified at birth, while &quot;assigned sex&quot; and &quot;assigned gender&quot; may also refer to any subsequent reassignments, especially common among intersex individuals.

The terminology has evolved across various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) maintained by the American Psychiatric Association. Initially, the third edition of the DSM referred to &quot;anatomic sex&quot;. By the fourth edition in 1994, the term &quot;assigned sex&quot; was introduced, with subsequent editions also using &quot;biological sex&quot; and &quot;natal gender&quot;. The latest revision in 2022 streamlined the language to consistently use &quot;sex assignment&quot;.

A 2006 consensus statement on intersex conditions also adopted the terms &quot;assigned sex&quot; and &quot;assigned gender&quot;. Sex is assigned as either male or female, leading to specific terms:




More visible adoption of the terminology of sex assignment has led to public debate and criticism. Mathematician Alan Sokal and biologist Richard Dawkins have argued against the &quot;assigned at birth&quot; terminology. In a 2024 op-ed for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, they contended that sex is an &quot;objective biological reality&quot; determined at conception and observed at birth, rather than assigned. They say that using &quot;assigned&quot; terminology, which they view as an example of &quot;social constructionism gone amok&quot;, distorts scientific facts and could undermine trust in medical institutions.

There is a consensus in the use of the term &quot;sex assignment&quot; for newborns with intersex conditions; observed chromosomal sex and assigned sex may intentionally differ for medical reasons (based upon predictions of psychosocial and psychosexual health in later life).

==Assignment in cases of infants with intersex traits, or cases of trauma==
Observation or recognition of an infant&#x27;s sex may be complicated in the case of intersex infants and children and in cases of early trauma. In such cases, the infant may be assigned male or female, and may receive intersex surgery to confirm that assignment. These medical interventions have increasingly been seen as a human rights violation due to their unnecessary nature and the potential for lifelong complications.
Cases of trauma include the famous John/Joan case, where sexologist John Money claimed successful reassignment from male to female of a 17-month-old boy whose penis was destroyed during circumcision. However, this claim was later shown to be largely false. The subject, David Reimer, later identified as a man.

The number of births with ambiguous genitals is in the range of 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 4,500 (0.05% to 0.02%). Typical examples would be an unusually prominent clitoris in an otherwise apparently typical girl, or complete cryptorchidism in an otherwise apparently typical boy. In most of these cases, a sex is tentatively assigned and the parents told that tests will be performed to confirm the apparent sex. Typical tests in this situation might include a pelvic ultrasound to determine the presence of a uterus, a testosterone or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone level, and/or a karyotype. In some of these cases a pediatric endocrinologist is consulted to confirm the tentative sex assignment. The expected assignment is usually confirmed within hours to a few days in these cases.

Some infants are born with enough ambiguity that assignment becomes a more drawn-out process of multiple tests and intensive education of the parents about sexual differentiation. In some of these cases, it is clear that the child will face physical difficulties or social stigma as they grow up, and deciding upon the sex of assignment involves weighing the advantages and disadvantages of either assignment. Intersex activists have criticised &quot;normalising&quot; procedures performed on infants and children, who are unable to provide informed consent.

=== History ===
In European societies, Roman law, post-classical canon law, and later common law, referred to a person&#x27;s sex as male, female, or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female. The 12th-century &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot; states that &quot;Whether a hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails&quot;. The foundation of common law, the 16th Century &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, described how a hermaphrodite could inherit &quot;either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile.&quot; Legal cases where sex assignment was placed in doubt have been described over the centuries.

With the medicalization of intersex, criteria for assignment have evolved over the decades, as clinical understanding of biological factors and diagnostic tests have improved, as surgical techniques have changed and potential complications have become clearer, and in response to the outcomes and opinions of adults who have grown up with various intersex conditions.

Before the 1950s, assignment was based almost entirely on the appearance of the external genitalia. Although physicians recognized that there were conditions in which the apparent secondary sexual characteristics could develop contrary to the person&#x27;s sex, and conditions in which the gonadal sex did not match that of the external genitalia, their ability to understand and diagnose such conditions in infancy was too poor to attempt to predict future development in most cases.

In the 1950s, endocrinologists developed a basic understanding of the major intersex conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), androgen insensitivity syndrome, and mixed gonadal dysgenesis. The discovery of cortisone allowed survival of infants with severe CAH for the first time. New hormone tests and karyotypes allowed more confident diagnosis in infancy and prediction of future development.

Sex assignment became more than choosing a sex of rearing, but also began to include surgical treatment. Undescended testes could be retrieved. A greatly enlarged clitoris could be amputated to the usual size, but attempts to create a penis were unsuccessful. John Money and others controversially believed that children were more likely to develop a gender identity that matched sex of rearing than might be determined by chromosomes, gonads, or hormones. The resulting medical model was termed the &quot;Optimal gender model&quot;.

==Challenges to requirements for sex assignment==
In recent years, the perceived need to legally assign sex is increasingly being challenged by transgender, transsexual, and intersex people. A report for the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice states &quot;Gender increasingly seems to be perceived as a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; identity feature, but so far is not regarded, nor protected as such in privacy regulations&quot;. Australian government guidelines state that &quot;departments and agencies that collect sex and/or gender information must not collect information unless it is necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of the agency&#x27;s functions or activities&quot;

Sex registration was introduced in the Netherlands in 1811 due to gender-specific rights and responsibilities, such as military conscription. Many gender-specific provisions in legislation no longer exist, but the provisions remain for rationales that include &quot;speed of identification procedures&quot;.

<text>Maurice Hubert Stans (March 22, 1908April 14, 1998) was an American accountant, civil servant, and political organizer who served as the 19th United States Secretary of Commerce from 1969 to 1972. He served as the finance chairman for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, working for the re-election of Richard Nixon. He pleaded guilty to five counts for technical violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act that were revealed during the larger investigation into the Watergate scandal.

==Early life and education==
Stans was born on March 22, 1908, in Shakopee, Minnesota, the son of James Hubert Stans and Mathilda Stans (nee Nyssen). His father was the only child of Jan Hendrik Stans and Maria Catharina Crijns, a Belgian couple who immigrated to the United States in 1880. Stans graduated from Shakopee High School in 1925. He worked at a local foundry before traveling to Chicago to find work with friend, Otto F. Schultz. The same year, he began work as a stenographer and bookkeeper for a Chicago importer, while attending evening classes at Northwestern University. In 1928 he joined the Chicago-based firm of Alexander Grant and Company, certified public accountants, and continued his part-time studies at Columbia University while working at the firm&#x27;s New York City office. He attended Columbia from 1928 to 1930. 

== Career ==
Stans was an executive partner with the Alexander Grant &amp; Co. accounting firm in Chicago from 1940 until 1955. He was a Certified Public Accountant, licensed in New York, Ohio and Virginia. He was President of the American Institute of Accountants from 1954 to 1955 and won the Gold Medal for Distinguished Service to the Profession in 1954. He was inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame in 1960.

=== Public servant under Eisenhower and Nixon ===
He later served as U.S. deputy postmaster general from 1955 to 1957, in the Dwight Eisenhower administration. He served as deputy director of the Bureau of the Budget from 1957 to 1958, and director of the Bureau of the Budget from 1958 to 1961, still under Eisenhower. He joined the Nixon administration as secretary of commerce from 1969 to 1972. 
In 1961, Stans was one of the founders of the African Wildlife Foundation.

=== Watergate ===

In mid-February 1972, Stans resigned as the secretary of commerce to chair the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), Richard Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign. Money that he raised for the campaign was clearly used to finance some of the illegal Watergate activities. Stans denied any knowledge of what the money was used for, only that it was authorized to be spent. 

On March 12, 1975, Stans pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the reporting sections of the Federal Election Campaign Act and two counts of accepting illegal campaign contributions. He was fined $5,000. The convictions were related to improperly giving campaign funds to G. Gordon Liddy, though Stans insisted that his guilt ended there and that he was not aware of Liddy&#x27;s plan to use the money for what became the Watergate break in.

He later authored a book, &quot;The Terrors of Justice: The Untold Side of Watergate&quot;, in which he detailed his side of the Watergate story. Stans also wrote a book called &quot;One of the Presidents&#x27; Men: Twenty Years With Eisenhower and Nixon&quot; about his time serving in the Cabinets of two different presidential administrations.

==Personal life==
Stans died at the Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California, on April 14, 1998, at age 90, from complications of congestive heart failure.

<text>Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) is a unit of the Florida Department of Transportation that operates toll roads in Florida. The current executive director is Nicola Liquori.

==History==

The Florida State Turnpike Authority was authorized by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Dan McCarty as the Turnpike Authority Act on June 11, 1953. The Authority was reorganized and incorporated into the newly formed Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in July 1969. The Turnpike’s functions became part of the FDOT pursuant to the reorganization of the State Government Act. At that time, individual FDOT Districts managed the Turnpike work program, operations, and maintenance in their areas. In 1988, the Florida Legislature created the Office of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike.

In 1990, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1316, authorizing the expansion of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to include construction of non-contiguous road projects as an alternative to assist in meeting the state’s backlog of needed highway facilities. The Legislature set environmental and financial feasibility standards, authorized toll increases on the existing system, and allowed higher rate per mile tolls on the new projects through Chapter 339.2275(3) of the Florida Statutes. The Legislature approved expansion projects and new interchanges subject to verification of economic feasibility, determination that the projects are consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with approved local government comprehensive plans were projects are located, and completion of a statement of the project’s significant environmental impacts. Fifty road projects were submitted for consideration and, ultimately, ten new roads were identified for possible construction, subject to meeting the feasibility requirements, and 15 new interchanges.

On April 11, 2002, Gov. Jeb Bush signed House Bill 261, creating Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise, and directing the Turnpike to pursue innovation and best private-sector business practices, to improve cost-effectiveness and timeliness in project delivery, to increase revenues and expand its capital program, and to improve quality of service to its customers. At that time, the Office of Toll Operations, formerly a separate division of the State of Florida, was folded into the FTE and is exempt from FDOT policies, procedures, and standards, subject to the secretary having the authority to apply any such policies, procedures, and standards to the FTE from time to time as deemed appropriate.

==System description==
The flagship route of the FTE is Florida&#x27;s Turnpike along with the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. The FTE also operates Polk Parkway (SR 570), Suncoast Parkway (SR 589), Veterans Expressway (SR 589), Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869), the Seminole Expressway and Southern Connector portions of SR 417, the southern of Daniel Webster Western Beltway (SR 429) and the western eight miles (13 km) of Beachline Expressway (SR 528), known as Beachline West.

The FTE collects tolls on the portion of Interstate 75 known as Alligator Alley, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the Pinellas Bayway System and the Beachline East (State Road 528), all FDOT-owned roads and bridges. It also provides toll collection services for the Garcon Point and Mid-Bay Bridges and the Walter Francis Spence Parkway in Florida&#x27;s Panhandle.

<doc id="762814" wikidata="Q7866980" url="?curid=762814" title="USS Abnaki">
<text>USS &quot;Abnaki&quot; (ATF-96) was the lead ship of the of fleet ocean tugs in the service of the United States Navy, named after the Abenaki tribe of Native Americans. She was laid down on 28 November 1942 at Charleston, South Carolina by Charleston Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock, launched on 22 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. James Mayon Jones, and commissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard on 25 November 1943. &quot;Abnaki&quot; earned three battle stars for service during the Korean War and 10 battle stars during the Vietnam War.

==Operational history==
===1944–1949===
The fleet ocean tug completed shakedown in Chesapeake Bay on 10 December and began operating with the Atlantic Fleet. She conducted towing operations up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States until the spring of 1944. On 12 April, she was in a collision off the Azores with the repair tug USS &quot;ATR-98&quot; which resulted in the sinking of the latter.

On 28 May of that year, she got underway from Norfolk, Virginia, bound for Oran, Algeria. On 4 June, however, while in the vicinity of the Azores, &quot;Abnaki&quot; received orders to rendezvous with Captain Daniel V. Gallery&#x27;s Task Group (TG) 22.3 built around USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;. That task group had just succeeded in capturing the , and &quot;Abnaki&quot; was to tow her to Bermuda. She arrived there with the prize on 19 June and remained 10 days before shaping a course for New York.

The tug spent the early days of July in New York and stood out to sea on the 11th, towing two covered lighters, &quot;YF-445&quot; and &quot;YF-447&quot;, in an Oran-bound convoy. She returned to New York on 19 August, having towed the battle damaged Free French warship &quot;Senegalaise&quot; from Oran. From 19 September to 5 December 1944, &quot;Abnaki&quot; made a round-trip voyage to Britain. During that mission, she towed barges and tank landing ships. On the return leg of that voyage, the ship made stops at Reykjavík, Iceland; and NS Argentia, Newfoundland; before returning to Norfolk. During January and February 1945, she again steamed to Oran and returned to Norfolk for repairs in preparation for duty with the Pacific Fleet.

On 24 April 1945, &quot;Abnaki&quot; passed between Capes Henry and Charles on her way to her new assignment. She arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 9 May, transited the canal, and continued her voyage from Balboa, Panama, on the 16th with an Army dredge in tow. The tug arrived in San Diego, on 2 June and remained for five days. On the 7th, she took the dredge in tow once again and weighed anchor for the Central Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the fleet tug entered the lagoon at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 25 July and discharged her tow. The following day, she got underway again and proceeded to Eniwetok Atoll, also in the Marshalls.

&quot;Abnaki&quot; remained there through the end of hostilities. Early in October, she shifted north to join the forces occupying Japan. That mission lasted through the end of 1945 and the first six months of 1946. On 6 July, the fleet tug departed Japanese waters and proceeded to China. Following a stop at Okinawa en route, she arrived at Shanghai on 16 July and began operations between that port and Tsingtao in support of American forces in China. On 24 October, she received orders sending her to the Mariana Islands. She arrived at Guam during the second week in November and provided towing service between the Marianas and the Admiralties through the end of the year. After February 1947, the Commander, Service Force, Pacific Fleet, expanded her sphere of operations to include ports in Japan and in China. The latter ports, however, were closed to her after the communist revolution in 1949.

===1950–1959===
The tug continued to operate in Far Eastern waters while the communist tide swept over the Asian mainland engulfing not only China but also the northern half of Korea where the Soviet occupation forces had established a puppet regime under Kim Il Sung on 1 May 1948. Just over two years later, that event led to the invasion of South Korea by communist forces from the north late in June 1950. Though American units, under the auspices of a Soviet-boycotted United Nations, moved into the breach quickly, &quot;Abnaki&quot; did not enter the zone of combat operations for over a year. In July 1951, however, she joined Service Division (ServDiv) 31 in providing mobile logistics support to the United Nations naval task forces engaged in the conflict. &quot;Abnaki&#x27;s&quot; direct support for United Nations forces in Korea ended in February 1952, and she resumed service in Western and Central Pacific waters somewhat removed from the designated combat zone.

Save for an overhaul or two at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, her service in the Far East and in the waters of the Central Pacific continued unbroken until 1955. After participating in evacuation of Nationalist Chinese troops and civilians from the Tachen Islands in March of that year, the tug served in the Orient for a little over three months more. On 15 July 1955, she got underway from Sasebo, Japan, for Hawaii. En route to Hawaii, the fleet tug encountered an Army ship, FS-179, in distress and took her in tow. The two ships arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 August. For the next 17 months, &quot;Abnaki&quot; operated from that base in the mid-Pacific operating area, voyaging only as far as such outlying islands as Midway and Johnston.

Her itinerary changed late in February 1957 when she steamed to San Francisco, to take in tow for the first leg of her journey to the east coast for her conversion to a guided missile cruiser. The two ships departed San Francisco on 2 March and arrived at Rodman in the Panama Canal Zone on the 29th. There, &quot;Abnaki&quot; turned her charge over to and headed back to Oahu for operations in Hawaiian waters through the summer. On 17 September, the fleet tug set sail for the Far East and provided support services for units of the 7th Fleet until returning to Pearl Harbor on 27 February 1958 and resuming mid-Pacific operations. On 18 November, she stood out of Pearl Harbor for another deployment with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific.

Upon her return to Hawaii midway through 1959, &quot;Abnaki&quot; took up the familiar chore of towing various types of vessels between locations in the islands and to the more distant Johnston and Midway.

===1960–1969===
On 6 February 1960, she stood out of Pearl Harbor and shaped a course just a few degrees west of north. The tug arrived at Adak, Alaska, on the 14th and assisted in the salvage of before sailing for Oahu on 5 May. Arriving in Pearl Harbor on 12 May, the ship resumed her mid-Pacific duties. On 3 April 1961, she embarked upon another deployment to the western Pacific. After four months of towing duties between such ports as Sasebo and Yokosuka in Japan, Ream in Cambodia, Naha and Buckner Bay at Okinawa, and Subic Bay in the Philippines, &quot;Abnaki&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 August.

Following a leave, upkeep, and repair period, she once again began mid-Pacific duties early in September and continued the task through the year&#x27;s end. On 24 January 1962, she departed Pearl Harbor and arrived in Adak on 1 February. The fleet tug conducted local operations in the Aleutians until 20 April when she shaped a course for Seattle, Washington. Following a six-day layover there, &quot;Abnaki&quot; headed for Oahu on 4 May and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 12th. That summer, between 23 July and 7 September, she again deployed to the Aleutians. A return to mid-Pacific operations came early in September and lasted until she moved to the western Pacific on 21 May 1963.

That four-month tour of duty consisted of the normal round of port visits and of towing services to units of the 7th Fleet. Similarly, her return to Pearl Harbor brought the familiar towing and salvage operations in the mid-Pacific operating area. That routine was broken only once, during late January and early February 1964 when she made a round-trip voyage to San Francisco. &quot;Abnaki&quot; spent much of 1964 in operations out of Pearl Harbor and concluded the year preparing to deploy to the western Pacific.

During the latter part of 1964, American involvement in South Vietnam began to escalate as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. That development heralded a change in the nature of &quot;Abnaki&#x27;s&quot; western Pacific deployments over the ensuing eight years. She departed Pearl Harbor with a dredge in tow on 4 January 1965 bound for Yokosuka, Japan. The dredge sank on the 19th; and, the following day, &quot;Abnaki&quot; entered Subic Bay in the Philippines. She operated locally out of Subic Bay until 5 March when she sailed for Vietnam. The tug served in Vietnamese waters as tender for a squadron of minecraft and conducted some patrols. She completed that assignment on 31 March and headed back to Subic Bay where she arrived on 4 April.

After eight days of upkeep at Subic Bay, she put to sea for a second tour of duty in Vietnamese waters. That mission concluded, &quot;Abnaki&quot; shaped a course for Hong Kong on 30 April for a liberty call from 3 to 8 May. Following a visit to Yokosuka from 14 to 20 May, the ship began the voyage back to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 June. After a 16-day leave and upkeep period, she resumed mid-Pacific operations out of her home port.

Following a three-month overhaul, three weeks of refresher training, and almost two months of local operations, &quot;Abnaki&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1966 for the western Pacific. She stopped at Guam along the way, before arriving in Nagasaki, Japan, late in April. The fleet tug towed an Army power barge from Nagasaki to Naha, Okinawa, for 12 days of upkeep. She departed that port on 19 May and arrived in Da Nang, South Vietnam, on the 22d. Between 23 May and 20 June, &quot;Abnaki&quot; operated in the South China Sea in support of 7th Fleet ships assigned to Yankee Station and made an overnight stop at Da Nang on 20 and 21 June before getting underway for Hong Kong. The ship remained in Hong Kong from 25 June to 2 July and then headed for Subic Bay for an upkeep period which occupied her for the bulk of July. On 26 July, she put to sea for Yokosuka and – after a stop at Buckner Bay, Okinawa – arrived at that port on 5 August. The tug stood out of Yokosuka a week later, towing LSSL-102, and moored at the Army pier at Sattahip, Thailand, on the 29th. She remained in Thailand, making one liberty call at Bangkok, until 22 September. Getting underway that day, the tug shaped a course for Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After nine days of upkeep at Kaohsiung, she set sail for Guam on 8 October and picked up her final tow of the deployment there on 16 October before steaming on toward Vietnam. She anchored off Vung Tau on Navy Day 1966, transferred her charge, and then got underway on 28 October to return home via Sasebo and Yokosuka.

The beginning of 1967 saw her resume local operations between Hawaii and the outlying islands. During the first three weeks in May, the fleet tug made a round-trip voyage to Seattle, Wash. After returning, &quot;Abnaki&quot; carried out mid-Pacific towing duties until mid-August. On the 18th, she exited Pearl Harbor on her way back to the Far East. Following stops at Guam and Subic Bay, the ship arrived at Danang on 15 September, took up duty on trawler surveillance patrol on Yankee Station, and spent most of the following month shadowing the Soviet trawler &quot;Ampermetr&quot;. Relieved on 15 October, &quot;Abnaki&quot; proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. On the way, however, she encountered Typhoon &quot;Carla&quot; and had to detour. Later, she went to the assistance of an Army tug towing a crane. When the Army vessel suffered mechanical difficulties that forced her to cut loose the crane to save herself, &quot;Abnaki&quot; brought the crane in safely. Next, she spent six days of rest and relaxation at Hong Kong before returning to Subic Bay for a three-week upkeep period.

&quot;Abnaki&quot; departed Subic Bay on 25 November and set course for Vietnam. On the 27th, the fleet tug joined and near Đức Phổ, South Vietnam, to assist in salvaging . After much labor, they refloated the tank landing ship on 1 December. On 7 December, she relieved as trawler surveillance unit. Relieved of that mission on the 23d, &quot;Abnaki&quot; steamed to My Tho where she picked up a tow on the 27th and shaped a course for Sasebo. However, the fleet tug stopped at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, from 6 to 19 January 1968 to have the patch on the hull of the barge she was towing replaced. Continuing on, &quot;Abnaki&quot; towed her charge into Sasebo on the 24th. On 30 January, she stood out of Sasebo on her way back to Pearl Harbor.

The ship reentered her home port on 12 February and began over a month of post-deployment stand down. From 18 March to 8 July, the ship resumed her familiar mid-Pacific duties. On 8 July, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which lasted until 25 October. For the next month, she completed refresher training and preparations for overseas movement. On 26 November, &quot;Abnaki&quot; returned to sea, again bound for the Far East.

The voyage west brought stops at Guam and Subic Bay – where &quot;Abnaki&quot; delivered floating crane YD-127 – before she reentered the combat zone off Vietnam. The tug arrived at Da Nang on 31 December 1968. On the morning of New Year&#x27;s Day 1969, she departed Danang to pick up garbage lighter YG-52 at Subic Bay. The ship arrived there on the 3rd, departed the next morning with her charge in tow, and delivered it at Da Nang on the 8th before heading back toward Subic Bay that same day. En route, she received orders to Naha, Okinawa, to assist in the salvage of a grounded tank landing ship. She completed that mission on 19 January, reentered Subic Bay on the 24th, and headed back toward Danang on the 29th. The ship arrived there on the 31st and, on 1 February, put to sea for a 21-day tour of duty on Yankee Station. Late in the month, she towed from Cam Ranh Bay to Yokosuka. In March, she visited Tsoying, Taiwan, to train members of the Taiwanese Navy in salvage techniques. After a liberty call at Hong Kong early in April, the ship returned to Subic Bay until late in the month. She got underway on the 26th bound for Guam with the medium auxiliary floating dry dock in tow. She and her charge reached Apra Harbor on 15 May; and, on the 16th, &quot;Abnaki&quot; continued on toward Hawaii.

===1970–1978===
The fleet tug arrived in Pearl Harbor on 28 May and began post-deployment stand down and a restricted availability. She commenced local operations on 1 July and that assignment continued into 1970. Late in January of that year, &quot;Abnaki&quot; headed for the western Pacific and arrived in Subic Bay toward the end of the second week in February. Although most of that deployment was devoted to operations out of Subic Bay followed by visits to Sasebo and Hong Kong, the fleet tug made a voyage into the Vietnam combat zone when she visited Da Nang late in May. In mid-June, she headed back to Pearl Harbor where she arrived at the end of the month for operations out of that port into the spring of the following year.

On 29 April 1971, she pointed her bow westward once more to deploy with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. She made a stop at Guam before arriving in Subic Bay in mid-May. Later in the month, she voyaged to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, apparently to deliver a tow, because she departed the Vietnamese port on the same day she arrived. The Vietnam War does not appear to have played a major role in her 1971 deployment since she made only a few brief stops there—mostly at Vung Tau. She spent a large proportion of her time in and around Subic Bay and made port visits to Hong Kong; Singapore; and Ream, Cambodia. Following the grounding of the on Kau I Chau Island, Hong Kong, on the night of 16–17 August 1971 during Typhoon Rose, &quot;Abnaki&quot; was the first U.S. Navy vessel to arrive on scene to begin salvage operations. Late in September, &quot;Abnaki&quot; stood out of Subic Bay for Apra Harbor, Guam, on her way back to Pearl Harbor. After an eight-day layover at Apra Harbor, she continued her voyage to the Oahu base where she arrived on 20 October to resume Hawaiian operations.

Towing and training missions occupied her time until she put to sea on 21 August 1972 to rejoin the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. Towing one Philippine minesweeper, escorting another, and making stops at Midway and Guam, Abnaki took over a month to make the voyage to Subic Bay. She arrived there on 28 September and remained until 3 October when she returned to sea to tow a floating crane to Vietnam. She arrived in Da Nang on 7 October, delivered her charge, and began duty as the standby salvage ship there. That duty involved staying in Da Nang harbor during the day to provide salvage services and putting to sea each night because of the threat posed by Viet Cong sapper-swimmers. She concluded that assignment on 20 October and then visited Hong Kong and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The tug returned to Subic Bay in mid-November and then ended the year visiting such ports as Ream, Singapore, and Bangkok.

During the latter portion of this deployment, &quot;Abnaki&quot; made no voyages to Vietnam. Instead, she operated exclusively out of Subic Bay, breaking that routine but once during the second half of January 1973 for missions to Kaohsiung and Tsoying in Taiwan. On 20 February, she departed Subic Bay to return home. Along the way, the tug made stops at Guam and Kwajalein before reentering Pearl Harbor on 13 March. Renewed operations out of Pearl Harbor lasted until 25 June 1973 when she got underway for a new home port – San Diego, California. The ship stood into her new base on 13 July and spent the remainder of the year either in port at San Diego or making tows to various points along the California coast. That employment continued into the New Year 1974. On 19 February, the ship entered the Fellows &amp; Stuart Shipyard for a seven-month overhaul.

&quot;Abnaki&quot; completed the overhaul on 19 September and returned to San Diego the next day. Refresher training followed in October; and, at the beginning of November, she resumed west coast operations out of San Diego. During December 1974 and the first part of January 1975, she prepared for overseas duty. On the 11th, the tug weighed anchor to begin her voyage to the Far East. She made only one stop – at Pearl Harbor from 20 to 22 January – before arriving in Subic Bay on 9 February. Two days later, she got underway to participate in Readex 1–75 conducted in the South China Sea. Following that exercise, &quot;Abnaki&quot; visited Yokosuka and Sasebo in Japan. In March, she made a four-day liberty call at Hong Kong followed by a visit to Singapore. She returned to Subic Bay early in April but, on the 10th, got underway for Vung Tau where she salvaged the cargo door of a C-5A cargo plane which had crashed shortly after takeoff from Tan Son Nhut Air Base. After participation in Operation Frequent Wind – the evacuation of Saigon – &quot;Abnaki&quot; returned to Yokosuka on 15 May for three weeks of upkeep before heading for the Marianas on 8 June. The tug arrived at Guam on 13 May, loaded supplies destined for the natives of the Marshall Islands, and put to sea again on the 16th. After dropping the supplies off at several of the smaller atolls in the Marshalls, she continued on via Pearl Harbor to San Diego where she arrived on 13 July.

Operations along the California coast kept the tug busy until the beginning of October when she began an extended restricted availability at San Diego. The new year began with the ship still in port at San Diego. However, she embarked upon her first tow on 2 January 1976 and remained active – shuttling tows between various California ports for the first seven months of 1976. On 7 August, the ship left San Diego to join a Fijian minesweeper at Seattle, Wash., for the voyage to Fiji. The two ships got underway on 16 August and set a course for Pearl Harbor where they arrived on 24 August and remained a week for repairs to the minesweeper&#x27;s communications equipment. En route to Suva, Fiji, &quot;Abnaki&quot; assisted a civilian auxiliary sailboat grounded on a reef at Palmyra Island and towed it to Christmas Island. &quot;Abnaki&quot; and the Fijian minesweeper arrived at Suva, Fiji, on 17 September. The American ship remained at Suva until the 21st when she got underway for Subic Bay. En route, she stopped at Kapingamarangi Atoll to drop off cargo for the natives and at West Fayu Island to investigate a suspected violation of territorial waters by a Japanese fishing trawler. She finally arrived in Subic Bay on 4 October.

The fleet tug conducted operations out of Subic Bay over the following month. On 7 November, she stood out of Subic Bay bound for Borneo. She made a five-day visit at Kuching and then got underway on 16 November for Puerto Princesa on Palawan in the southwestern Philippines. &quot;Abnaki&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 22 November and remained there until the 26th when she shaped a course for Hong Kong. At the crown colony from 29 November to 9 December, she combined business with pleasure, serving as station submarine service ship while portions of her crew enjoyed liberty ashore. The ship returned to Subic Bay on 11 December and remained until the 19th. On the latter day, she shaped a course for the Marianas. &quot;Abnaki&quot; arrived at Guam on Christmas Eve day 1976. On 29 December, she headed for Kwajalein to embark Rear Admiral Carroll, Commander, Naval Forces, Marianas, for transportation to Kusaie Atoll for its independence celebration. The round-trip voyage from Kwajalein to Kusaie took from 2 to 6 January 1977. On 8 January, &quot;Abnaki&quot; sailed to Guam where she picked up two-yard craft to tow to Pearl Harbor. Departing Guam on 12 January 1977, she dropped off her charges at Pearl Harbor on 13 February, resumed her voyage to the west coast the following day, and reached San Diego on 22 February.

&quot;Abnaki&quot; spent the remainder of her Navy career operating along the west coast. Following post-deployment stand down and an extended availability, in May, she resumed towing and other operations along the California coast including surveillance operations, other fleet services, and training evolutions. At the beginning of 1978, &quot;Abnaki&quot; towed a cable-laying ship to Panama. During that voyage, she also made a call at Esmeraldas, Ecuador, before returning to San Diego on 12 February 1978. Normal operations along the west coast occupied her time from mid-February until April. The first week in April brought fleet exercises followed by a resumption of fleet services. During the first half of June, &quot;Abnaki&quot; participated in another series of fleet exercises and then resumed her usual west coast missions.

On 15 August 1978, &quot;Abnaki&quot; began preparations for decommissioning and transfer to the Mexican Navy. She was placed out of commission on 30 September 1978 and was simultaneously transferred to the Mexican Navy. Her name was struck from the Navy list that same day, and she was commissioned in the Mexican Navy as &quot;Yaqui&quot; (A-18), Lt. Guttierez .

<text>Sears Cook Walker (March 28, 1805 – January 30, 1853) was an American astronomer.

Born at Wilmington, Massachusetts son of Benjamin Walker and Susanna Cook, he graduated from Harvard University in 1825, he was a teacher till 1835, was an actuary in 1835-1845 for the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities, and then became one of several assistants at the United States Naval Observatory following orders from Superintendent Matthew Fontaine Maury. Sears C. Walker was fired by Maury for publishing United States Naval Observatory findings on the planet Neptune in a foreign nation&#x27;s scientific news through the help of Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution. But it was too late and Walker got personal credit for work that he was only partially involved in. In 1847 he took charge of the longitude department of the United States Coast Survey, where he was among the first to make use of the electric telegraph for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between two stations, and he introduced the method of registering transit observations electrically by means of a chronograph. He also investigated the orbit of the newly discovered planet Neptune. He died near Cincinnati in 1853.

Walker learned to read at least seven languages. Using his knowledge of German he read the work of German astronomers. The annotations in his copy of Astronomische Nachrichten show that he was interested in data reduction and computation of orbits. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1837.

His brother Timothy Walker (1802-1856) was a leader of the Ohio bar.

<doc id="762827" wikidata="Q7282876" url="?curid=762827" title="Raggadeath">
<text>Raggadeath was a Canadian rock band that enjoyed moderate success in the mid-1990s. The band fused heavy metal with dancehall reggae-style rhythms and vocals.

The band&#x27;s core members and founders were producer/dj/drummer Stephen Kendall and producer/engineer/bassist/keyboardist Walter Sobczak.

Steve Major played all the guitars on the records. Dean Bentley on drums and Darren Quinn on guitar of Monster Voodoo Machine were added for the live shows. The band utilized a variety of vocalists, most notably rapper Michie Mee. Rapper Koze Kozma was also an early band member, but was deported to the United Kingdom after disappearing for six weeks and then turning up weeks later as a Hare Krishna. All of the band&#x27;s recordings were produced by Walter Sobczak and Stephen Kendall, and engineered by Walter Sobczak.

The band&#x27;s biggest Canadian hit was &quot;One Life&quot; in 1995, achieving high rotation on MuchMusic, and being voted Favourite Song in &quot;Chart&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end reader&#x27;s poll. &quot;One Life&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 1995 MuchMusic Video Awards. The 1995 album &quot;Why Ask Why&quot;, containing the singles &quot;One Life&quot; and &quot;Why Ask Why&quot;, was also released by Virgin in several European markets. Due to the band members&#x27; other commitments and Kozma&#x27;s disappearance the album was not supported by a concert tour, with an appearance on the MuchMusic Video Awards in 1995 being the band&#x27;s only major live performance to support the album.

Raggadeath also achieved moderate international success with its self-titled 1997 album, which featured &quot;Dance with the Devil&quot; and a cover of Eddy Grant&#x27;s &quot;Electric Avenue&quot;. At this time the band undertook its first significant tour. The self-titled 1997 album was licensed by Attic Records to Edel AG in Germany, Roadrunner Records in the Netherlands, and TWA in Australia. None of the band&#x27;s work was released in the USA.

With their popularity faltering due to popular culture&#x27;s shift from alternative rock toward electronica in the late 1990s, the band broke up following the 1997 album. Sobczak continued with record engineering/production, later becoming chief engineer at The Studio at Puck&#x27;s Farm, and Kendall returned to his career as a DJ later DJing at the Swan in England. Major returned to studio work with Toronto&#x27;s Wellesley Sound studio, while Quinn and Mee continued to collaborate under the band name The Day After.

<doc id="762829" wikidata="Q1437106" url="?curid=762829" title="Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act">
<text>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA, , ) is a United States federal law that establishes procedures for the surveillance and collection of foreign intelligence on domestic soil.

FISA was enacted in response to revelations of widespread privacy violations by the federal government under president Richard Nixon. It requires federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to obtain authorization for gathering &quot;foreign intelligence information&quot; between &quot;foreign powers&quot; and &quot;agents of foreign powers&quot; suspected of espionage or terrorism. The law established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants.

Although FISA was initially limited to government use of electronic surveillance, subsequent amendments have broadened the law to regulate other intelligence-gathering methods, including physical searches, pen register and trap and trace (PR/TT) devices, and compelling the production of certain types of business records.

FISA has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks, with several added provisions garnering political and public controversy due to privacy concerns.

==History and background==
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was introduced on May 18, 1977, by Senator Ted Kennedy and was signed into law by President Carter on 25 October 1978. The bill was cosponsored by nine Senators: Birch Bayh, James O. Eastland, Jake Garn, Walter Huddleston, Daniel Inouye, Charles Mathias, John L. McClellan, Gaylord Nelson, and Strom Thurmond.

The FISA resulted from extensive investigations by Senate Committees into the legality of domestic intelligence activities. These investigations were led separately by Sam Ervin and Frank Church in 1978 as a response to President Richard Nixon&#x27;s usage of federal resources, including law enforcement agencies, to spy on political and activist groups. The law itself was crafted in large part in closed door meetings between legislators and members of the Justice Department.
The act was created to provide judicial and congressional oversight of the government&#x27;s covert surveillance activities of foreign entities and individuals in the United States, while maintaining the secrecy needed to protect national security.

===Warrantless domestic wiretapping program===
FISA came into public prominence in December 2005 following an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that described a program of warrantless domestic wiretapping ordered by the Bush administration and carried out by the National Security Agency since 2002; a subsequent &quot;Bloomberg&quot; article suggested this may have already begun by June 2000. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later confirmed the existence of the program, which was codenamed Stellar Wind.

Without obtaining a FISA warrant, the NSA monitored phone calls, Internet activities, text messages, and other forms of communication involving any party it believed to be outside the U.S., regardless of whether part of the communication took place domestically. The Bush administration initially defended the program as an extension of executive authority; amid public, political, and legal pressure, the program was ended in January 2007 and the government announced it would seek warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). 

=== Section 702 ===
Following the controversy over Stellar Wind, Congress later legalized a form of that program in Section 702.

==Provisions==
The subchapters of FISA provide for:

* Electronic surveillance ()
* Physical searches ()
* Pen registers and trap &amp; trace devices for foreign intelligence purposes ()
* Access to certain business records for foreign intelligence purposes ()
* Reporting requirement ()

===Electronic surveillance===
Generally, the statute permits electronic surveillance in two different scenarios.

====Without a court order====
The President may authorize, through the Attorney General, electronic surveillance without a court order for the period of one year, provided that it is only to acquire foreign intelligence information, that it is solely directed at communications or property controlled exclusively by foreign powers, that there is no substantial likelihood that it will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party, and that it be conducted only in accordance with defined minimization procedures.

The code defines &quot;foreign intelligence information&quot; to mean information necessary to protect the United States against actual or potential grave attack, sabotage or international terrorism.

&quot;Foreign powers&quot; means a foreign government, any faction of a foreign nation not substantially composed of U.S. persons, and any entity directed or controlled by a foreign government. The definition also includes groups engaged in international terrorism and foreign political organizations. The sections of FISA authorizing electronic surveillance and physical searches without a court order specifically exclude their application to groups engaged in international terrorism.

A &quot;U.S. person&quot; includes citizens, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, and corporations incorporated in the United States.

&quot;Minimization procedures&quot; limit the collection of information concerning United States persons by protecting their identities and requiring a court order to retain the communications for longer than 72 hours. The communications can be retained without court order if there is evidence of a crime. Identification of a US person, known as &quot;unmasking&quot;, may also be authorized if an agency believes it is necessary in order to understand the intelligence or believes that the person was committing a crime.

The Attorney General is required to make a certification of these conditions under seal to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and report on their compliance to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Since (a)(1)(A) of this Act specifically limits warrantless surveillance to foreign powers as defined by 50 U.S.C. §1801(a) (1),(2),(3) and omits the definitions contained in 50 U.S.C. §1801(a) (4),(5),(6) the act does not authorize the use of warrantless surveillance on: groups engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation thereof; foreign-based political organizations, not substantially composed of United States persons; or entities that are directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments. Under FISA, anyone who engages in electronic surveillance except as authorized by statute is subject to both criminal penalties and civil liabilities.

Under 50 U.S.C. § 1811, the President may also authorize warrantless surveillance at the beginning of a war. Specifically, he may authorize such surveillance &quot;for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress&quot;.

====With a court order====
Alternatively, the government may seek a court order permitting the surveillance using the FIS court. This is called the traditional intelligence collection, because it is &quot;the targeted monitoring of a suspected clandestine operative of a foreign power.&quot; Approval of a FISA application requires the court find probable cause that the target of the surveillance be a &quot;foreign power&quot; or an &quot;agent of a foreign power&quot; inside the United States and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent. In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain &quot;minimization requirements&quot; for information pertaining to U.S. persons. If the foreign power&#x27;s suspected agent communicates with Americans, the communications of U.S. citizens are incidentally intercepted even though they are not the targets of the surveillance.

Depending on the type of surveillance, approved orders or extensions of orders may be active for 90 days, 120 days, or a year. FISA warrants require renewal depending on the type of surveillance and type of warrant either every 90 days (if targeting a U.S. person) or 120 days (if targeting a non-U.S. person).

===FISA court===
The Act created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and enabled it to oversee requests for surveillance warrants by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies (primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency) against suspected foreign intelligence agents inside the U.S. The court is located within the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C. The court is staffed by eleven judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States to serve seven-year terms.

Proceedings before the FISA court are &quot;ex parte&quot; and non-adversarial. The court hears evidence presented solely by the Department of Justice. There is no provision for a release of information regarding such hearings, or for the record of information actually collected. The USA Freedom Act (Section 402), however, requires the government to declassify and publicly release &quot;to the greatest extent practicable&quot; each order, decision and opinion of the court if it contains a &quot;significant construction or interpretation of law.&quot;

FISC meets in secret, and approves or denies requests for search warrants. Only the number of warrants applied for, issued and denied, is reported. In 1980 (the first full year after its inception), it approved 322 warrants. This number has steadily grown to 2,224 warrants in 2006. In the period 1979–2006, a total of 22,990 applications for warrants were made to the Court of which 22,985 were approved (sometimes with modifications; or with the splitting up, or combining, of warrants for legal purposes), and only 5 were definitively rejected.

Denials of FISA applications by the FISC may be appealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. The Court of Review is a three-judge panel. Since its creation, the court has come into session twice: in 2002 and 2008.

===Physical searches===
In addition to electronic surveillance, FISA permits the &quot;physical search&quot; of the &quot;premises, information, material, or property used exclusively by&quot; a foreign power. The requirements and procedures are nearly identical to those for electronic surveillance.

===Telephone metadata===
In the 2020 case, &quot;United States v. Moalin&quot;, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the federal government violated FISA, and possibly the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, when it collected the telephony metadata of millions of Americans.

===Remedies for violations===
Both the subchapters covering physical searches and electronic surveillance provide for criminal and civil liability for violations of FISA.

Criminal sanctions follows violations of electronic surveillance by &quot;intentionally&quot; engaging in electronic surveillance under the color of law or through disclosing information known to have been obtained through unauthorized surveillance. The penalties for either act are fines up to US$10,000, up to five years in jail, or both.

In addition, the statute creates a cause of action for private individuals whose communications were unlawfully monitored. The statute permits actual damages of not less than $1,000 or $100 per day. In addition, that statute authorizes punitive damages and an award of attorney&#x27;s fees. Similar liability is found under the subchapter pertaining to physical searches. In both cases, the statute creates an affirmative defense for law enforcement personnel acting within their official duties and pursuant to a valid court order. Presumably, such a defense is not available to those operating exclusively under presidential authorization.

==Constitutionality==
===Before FISA===
In 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the requirements of the Fourth Amendment applied equally to electronic surveillance and to physical searches. &quot;Katz v. United States&quot;, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). The Court did not address whether such requirements apply to issues of national security. Shortly after, in 1972, the Court took up the issue again in &quot;United States v. United States District Court, Plamondon&quot;, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), where the court held that court approval was required in order for the domestic surveillance to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. Justice Powell wrote that the decision did not address this issue that &quot;may be involved with respect to activities of foreign powers or their agents&quot;.

Immediately preceding FISA, a number of courts squarely addressed the issue of &quot;warrantless wiretaps&quot;. In both &quot;United States v. Brown&quot;, 484 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1973), and &quot;United States v. Butenko&quot;, 494 F.2d 593 (3rd Cir. 1974), the courts upheld warrantless wiretaps. In &quot;Brown&quot;, a U.S. citizen&#x27;s conversation was captured by a wiretap authorized by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence purposes. In &quot;Butenko&quot;, the court held a wiretap valid if the primary purpose was for gathering foreign intelligence information.

A plurality opinion in &quot;Zweibon v. Mitchell&quot;, 516 F.2d 594 (D.C. Cir. 1975), held that a warrant was required for the domestic surveillance of a domestic organization. In this case, the court found that the domestic organization was not a &quot;foreign power or their agent&quot;, and &quot;absent exigent circumstances, all warrantless electronic surveillance is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional.&quot;

===Post-FISA===
There have been very few cases involving the constitutionality of FISA. Two lower court decisions found FISA constitutional. In &quot;United States v. Duggan&quot;, 743 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1984), the defendants were members of the Irish Republican Army. They were convicted for various violations regarding the shipment of explosives and firearms. The court held that there were compelling considerations of national security in the distinction between the treatment of U.S. citizens and non-resident aliens.

In the &quot;United States v. Nicholson&quot;, 955 F. Supp. 588 (E.D. Va. 1997), the defendant moved to suppress all evidence gathered under a FISA order. The court affirmed the denial of the motion. There, the court flatly rejected claims that FISA violated Due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, Equal protection, Separation of powers, nor the Right to counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment.

However, in a third case, the special review court for FISA, the equivalent of a Circuit Court of Appeals, opined differently. In &quot;In re Sealed Case&quot;, 310 F.3d 717, 742 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002), the special court stated &quot;[A]ll the other courts to have decided the issue [have] held that the President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information . ... We take for granted that the President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the President&#x27;s constitutional power.&quot;

==Criticism==

K. A. Taipale of the World Policy Institute, James Jay Carafano of The Heritage Foundation, and Philip Bobbitt of Columbia Law School, among others, have argued that FISA may need to be amended to include, among other things, procedures for programmatic approvals, as it may no longer be adequate to address certain foreign intelligence needs and technology developments, including: the transition from circuit-based communications to packet-based communications; the globalization of telecommunication infrastructure; and the development of automated monitoring techniques, including data mining and traffic analysis.

John R. Schmidt, associate attorney general (1994–1997) in the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton, expressed a need for programmatic approval of technology-enabled surveillance programs. He recalled early arguments made by then-Attorney General Edward Levi to the Church Committee that foreign intelligence surveillance legislation should include provisions for programmatically authorizing surveillance programs because of the particular needs of foreign intelligence where &quot;virtually continuous surveillance, which by its nature does not have specifically predetermined targets&quot; may be required. In these situations, &quot;the efficiency of a warrant requirement would be minimal.&quot;

In a 2006 opinion, Judge Richard Posner wrote that FISA &quot;retains value as a framework for monitoring the communications of known terrorists, but it is hopeless as a framework for detecting terrorists. [FISA] requires that surveillance be conducted pursuant to warrants based on probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a terrorist, when the desperate need is to find out who is a terrorist.&quot;

The ACLU considers the FISA Act to be unconstitutional for several reasons including: the law was designed to mainly address terrorism threats, but in fact intercepts communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind; and that &quot;the government can create huge databases that contain information about U.S. persons obtained without warrants and then search these databases at a later point.&quot;

==Amendments==
===USA PATRIOT Act===
The Act was amended in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, primarily to include terrorism on behalf of groups that are not specifically backed by a foreign government.

===Lone wolf amendment===
In 2004, FISA was amended to include a &quot;lone wolf&quot; provision. . A &quot;lone wolf&quot; is a non-U.S. person who engages in or prepares for international terrorism. The provision amended the definition of &quot;foreign power&quot; to permit the FISA courts to issue surveillance and physical search orders without having to find a connection between the &quot;lone wolf&quot; and a foreign government or terrorist group. However, &quot;if the court authorizes such a surveillance or physical search using this new definition of &#x27;agent of a foreign power&#x27;, the FISC judge has to find, in pertinent part, that, based upon the information provided by the applicant for the order, the target had engaged in or was engaging in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor&quot;.

===Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006===
On March 16, 2006, Senators Mike DeWine (R-OH), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 (S.2455), under which the President would be given certain additional limited statutory authority to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States subject to enhanced Congressional oversight. Also on March 16, 2006, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) introduced the National Security Surveillance Act of 2006 (), which would amend FISA to grant retroactive amnesty for warrantless surveillance conducted under presidential authority and provide FISA court (FISC) jurisdiction to review, authorize, and oversight &quot;electronic surveillance programs&quot;. On May 24, 2006, Senator Specter and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act of 2006 () asserting FISA as the exclusive means to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance.

All three competing bills were the subject of Judiciary Committee hearings throughout the summer. On September 13, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve all three mutually exclusive bills, thus, leaving it to the full Senate to resolve.

On July 18, 2006, U.S. Representative Heather Wilson (R-NM) introduced the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act (). Wilson&#x27;s bill would give the President the authority to authorize electronic surveillance of international phone calls and e-mail linked specifically to identified terrorist groups immediately following or in anticipation of an armed or terrorist attack on the United States. Surveillance beyond the initial authorized period would require a FISA warrant or a presidential certification to Congress. On September 28, 2006, the House of Representatives passed Wilson&#x27;s bill and it was referred to the Senate.

===Protect America Act of 2007===
On July 28, 2007, President Bush called on Congress to pass legislation to reform the FISA in order to ease restrictions on surveillance of terrorist suspects where one party (or both parties) to the communication are located overseas. He asked that Congress pass the legislation before its August 2007 recess. On August 3, 2007, the Senate passed a Republican-sponsored version of FISA (S. 1927) in a vote of 60 to 28. The House followed by passing the bill, 227–183. The Protect America Act of 2007 (, ) was then signed into law by George W. Bush on August 5, 2007.

Under the Protect America Act of 2007, communications that begin or end in a foreign country may be wiretapped by the U.S. government without supervision by the FISA Court. The Act removes from the definition of &quot;electronic surveillance&quot; in FISA any surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. As such, surveillance of these communications no longer requires a government application to, and order issuing from, the FISA Court.

The Act provides procedures for the government to &quot;certify&quot; the legality of an acquisition program, for the government to issue directives to providers to provide data or assistance under a particular program, and for the government and recipient of a directive to seek from the FISA Court, respectively, an order to compel provider compliance or relief from an unlawful directive. Providers receive costs and full immunity from civil suits for compliance with any directives issued pursuant to the Act.

A summary of key provisions follows. The Act empowers the Attorney General or Director of National Intelligence (&quot;DNI&quot;) to authorize, for up to one year, the acquisition of communications concerning &quot;persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States&quot; if the Attorney General and DNI determine that each of five criteria has been met:

* There are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States;
* The acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance (meaning it does not involve solely domestic communications);
* The acquisition involves obtaining the communications data from or with the assistance of a communications service provider who has access to communications;
* A significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information; and
* Minimization procedures outlined in the FISA will be used.

This determination by the Attorney General and DNI must be certified in writing, under oath, and supported by appropriate affidavit(s). If immediate action by the government is required and time does not permit the preparation of a certification, the Attorney General or DNI can direct the acquisition orally, with a certification to follow within 72 hours. The certification is then filed with the FISA Court.

Once the certification is filed with the FISA Court, the Attorney General or DNI can direct a provider to undertake or assist in the undertaking of the acquisition.

If a provider fails to comply with a directive issued by the Attorney General or DNI, the Attorney General may seek an order from the FISA Court compelling compliance with the directive. Failure to obey an order of the FISA Court may be punished as a contempt of court.

Likewise, a person receiving a directive may challenge the legality of that directive by filing a petition with the FISA Court. An initial review must be conducted within 48 hours of the filing to determine whether the petition is frivolous, and a final determination concerning any non-frivolous petitions must be made – in writing – within 72 hours of receipt of the petition.

Determinations of the FISA Court may be appealed to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Appeals, and a petition for a writ of certiorari of a decision from the FICA can be made to the U.S. Supreme Court.

All petitions must be filed under seal.

The Act allows providers to be compensated, at the prevailing rate, for providing assistance as directed by the Attorney General or DNI.

The Act provides explicit immunity from civil suit in any federal or state court for providing any information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with a directive under the Act.

Within 120 days, the Attorney General must submit to the FISA Court for its approval the procedures by which the government will determine that acquisitions authorized by the Act conform with the Act and do not involve purely domestic communications. The FISA Court then will determine whether the procedures comply with the Act. The FISA Court thereafter will enter an order either approving the procedures or directing the government to submit new procedures within 30 days or cease any acquisitions under the government procedures. The government may appeal a ruling of the FISA Court to the FICA and ultimately the Supreme Court.

On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General shall inform the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate of incidents of noncompliance with a directive issued by the Attorney General or the DNI, incidents of noncompliance with FISA Court-approved procedures by the Intelligence Community, and the number of certifications and directives issued during the reporting period.

The amendments to FISA made by the Act expire 180 days after enactment, except that any order in effect on the date of enactment remains in effect until the date of expiration of such order and such orders can be reauthorized by the FISA Court. The Act expired on February 17, 2008.

====Subsequent developments====
Legal experts experienced in national security issues are divided on how broadly the new law could be interpreted or applied. Some believe that due to subtle changes in the definitions of terms such as &quot;electronic surveillance&quot;, it could empower the government to conduct warrantless physical searches and even seizures of communications and computer devices and their data which belong to U.S. citizens while they are in the United States, if the government contended that those searches and potential seizures were related to its surveillance of parties outside the United States. Intelligence officials, while declining to comment directly on such possibilities, respond that such interpretations are overly broad readings of the act, and unlikely to actually occur.

In a September 10, 2007 address at a symposium on modernizing FISA held at Georgetown University Law Center&#x27;s National Security Center, Kenneth L. Wainstein, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, argued against the current six-month sunset provision in the Protect America Act of 2007, saying that the broadened surveillance powers the act provides for should be made permanent. Wainstein proposed that internal audits by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Division of the Justice Department, with reporting to select groups of Congressmen, would ensure that the expanded capability would not be abused.

Also on September 10, DNI Mike McConnell testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He mistakenly claimed that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany.

Speaking at National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland on September 19, 2007, President George W. Bush urged Congress to make the provisions of the Protect America Act permanent. Bush also called for retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies who had cooperated with government surveillance efforts, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s particularly important for Congress to provide meaningful liability protection to those companies now facing multibillion-dollar lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in efforts to defend our nation, following the 9/11 attacks&quot;.

On October 4, 2007, the bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee of the Constitution Project, co-chaired by David Keene and David D. Cole, issued its &quot;Statement on the Protect America Act&quot;. The Statement urged Congress not to reauthorize the PAA, saying the language of the bill &quot;runs contrary to the tripartite balance of power the Framers envisioned for our constitutional democracy, and poses a serious threat to the very notion of government of the people, by the people and for the people&quot;. Some in the legal community have questioned the constitutionality of any legislation that would retroactively immunize telecommunications firms alleged to have cooperated with the government from civil liability for having potentially violated their customers&#x27; privacy rights.

In an article appearing in the January/February 2008 issue of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers journal of Security and Privacy, noted technology experts from academia and the computing industry found significant flaws in the technical implementation of the Protect America Act which they said created serious security risks, including the danger that such a surveillance system could be exploited by unauthorized users, criminally misused by trusted insiders, or abused by the government.

On October 7, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that House Democrats planned to introduce alternative legislation which would provide for one-year &quot;umbrella&quot; warrants, and would require the Justice Department Inspector General to audit the use of those warrants and issue quarterly reports to a special FISA court and to Congress. The proposed bill would not include immunity for telecommunications firms facing lawsuits in connection with the administration&#x27;s NSA warrantless surveillance program. House Democrats said that as long as the administration withholds requested documents explaining the basis for the program that they cannot consider immunity for firms alleged to have facilitated it. On October 10, 2007, comments on the White House South Lawn, President Bush said he would not sign any bill that did not provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications corporations.

On October 18, 2007, the House Democratic leadership put off a vote on the proposed legislation by the full chamber to avoid consideration of a Republican measure that made specific references to Osama bin Laden. At the same time, the Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly reached a compromise with the White House on a different proposal that would give telephone carriers legal immunity for any role they played in the National Security Agency&#x27;s domestic eavesdropping program approved by President Bush after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

On November 15, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–9 along party lines to send an alternative measure to the full Senate other than the one the intelligence committee had crafted with the White House.

On the same day, the House of Representatives voted 227–189 to approve a Democratic bill that would expand court oversight of government surveillance inside the United States while denying immunity to telecom companies.

In February 2008, the Senate passed the version of the new FISA that would allow telecom companies immunity. On March 13, 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives held a secret session to discuss related information. On March 14, the House voted 213–197 to approve a bill that would &quot;not&quot; grant telecom immunity – far short of the 2/3 majority required to override a Presidential veto. The Senate and House bills are compared and contrasted in a June 12, 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service.

On March 13, 2008, the House of Representatives held a secret, closed door meeting to debate changes to the FISA bill.

===FISA Amendments Act of 2008===
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 passed by the United States Congress on July 9, 2008. The amendments added a new Title VII to the Act, which was slated to expire at the end of 2012 pending reauthorization; Congress subsequently extended the provision to December 31, 2017. The 2008 amendments gave telecoms immunity, increased the time allotted for warrantless surveillance, and adds provisions for emergency eavesdropping. On June 20, 2008, the House of Representatives passed the amendment with a vote of 293 to 129. It passed in the Senate 69 to 28 on July 9, 2008 after a failed attempt to strike Title II from the bill by Senator Dodd. On July 10, 2008, President Bush signed it into law.

===2015 USA Freedom Act===
First proposed in response to the disclosures of NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which revealed mass surveillance undertaken by the agency, the USA Freedom Act was intended by its sponsors to provide a &quot;balanced approach&quot; to intelligence gathering. The law restored and modified several provisions of the Patriot Act, overhauled the NSA, and required the U.S. government to undergo standard court procedures in order to gather data regarding suspicious activities.

===FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017===
After months of congressional hearings and some public controversy, following a short-term extension of three weeks, Congress passed a six-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which was signed into law in January 2018.

Beginning in late 2016, the government initiate efforts to persuade Congress to extend the surveillance authority in Title VII of the Act, which, pursuant to the 2008 and 2012 amendments, was slated to expire on December 31, 2017. Tom Cotton, a Republican Senator from Arkansas, introduced a bill to permanently extend the provisions of Title VII with no changes, but the bill did not advance, as many in Congress were seeking reforms to address privacy concerns. The U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary introduced an extension bill with significant proposed reforms, as did the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, but ultimately a version of the extension with less significant reforms was advanced by U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and in effect that version, through a complex series of amendments was ultimately enacted into law. The Senate agreed to a House amendment on January 18, 2018, and the President signed the legislation, S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–118), into law on January 19, 2018.

FISA Section 702 allows the National Security Agency to conduct searches of foreigners&#x27; communications without any warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans. Section 702 of FISA more specifically &quot;brings under FISC jurisdiction various intelligence-collection programs that target categories of non-Americans outside the United States. These foreigners also communicate with Americans, so the latter are incidentally intercepted.&quot; The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 extends Section 702 for six years, to December 31, 2023, and most notably included new restrictions on querying surveillance databases, prohibited the resumption of certain types of collection about a target that were not directly addressed to or from that target, unless Congress approved such collection within 30 days of having been notified of the resumption, and provided for additional reporting by the Executive Branch of surveillance activities. Many privacy and civil liberties advocates argued that the reforms enacted by the extension bill were inadequate, but their arguments were successfully opposed by the government.

The January 2018 law also made unauthorized removal and retention of classified information of the United States government a felony crime punishable by five years imprisonment and/or a fine.

===2023 short-term reauthorization===
Pursuant to the most recent reauthorization in 2017, Section 702 of FISA was set to expire by the end of 2023. At the beginning of 2023, several Biden administration officials began urging Congress to renew the provision, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, and NSA Director Paul M. Nakasone. Federal authorities and other advocates have argued that Section 702 is critical to national security, whereas critics have reaffirmed ongoing concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Several lawmakers, particularly among House Republicans, have called for any reauthorization to be contingent on several reforms, including limiting the scope of who can be investigated, requiring a warrant for surveillance in all instances, and restricting the amount of time collected data can be stored. According to an expected clarification report on US espionage released on April 21, 2023, the number of times the FBI looked up information about Americans in a repository of information collected under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2022, decreased by more than 95% in 2022. The cuts follow a series of reforms the FBI made in the summer of 2021 to limit database searches for information about Americans who correspond with foreigners under surveillance. On December 14, 2023, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a short-term extension of Section 702 until April 19, 2024.

=== Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act of 2024 ===
On April 10, 2024, Donald Trump urged Congress to &quot;kill FISA&quot; based on claims of FBI surveillance during his 2016 presidential campaign, leading libertarian Republicans to join progressive Democrats in opposing Section 702&#x27;s reauthorization on privacy-related grounds. To secure its passage, House Speaker Mike Johnson reduced the reauthorization to two years, rather than the typical five-year term, to allow Trump to veto a hypothetical 2026 reauthorization if he wins the 2024 presidential election. After Congress rejected various privacy-related amendments to minimize the gap in Section 702 authorization, the Senate approved the bill by a 60–34 vote with bipartisan support, and President Joe Biden signed the two-year reauthorization on April 20, 2024.

<text>The Champs are an American rock and roll band, most famous for their Latin-tinged 1958 instrumental single &quot;Tequila&quot;. The group took their name from that of Gene Autry&#x27;s horse, Champion, and was formed by studio executives at Autry&#x27;s Challenge Records to record a B-side for the Dave Burgess single, &quot;Train to Nowhere&quot;. The intended throwaway track became more famous than its A-side, as &quot;Tequila&quot; went to No. 1 in just three weeks, and the band became the first group to go to the top spot with an instrumental that was their first release. The song was recorded at Gold Star Studios in fall 1957, and in 1959 won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

== History ==
=== Success with their 1958 song &quot;Tequila&quot; ===
&quot;Tequila&quot; was written by the saxophonist Danny Flores, although he was credited as Chuck Rio because he was under contract to another record label (RPM Records) at the time. Flores, who was of Mexican heritage and died in September 2006, was known as the &quot;Godfather of Latino rock&quot;. Flores&#x27; &quot;dirty sax&quot; and his low-voiced &quot;Tequila&quot; are the hallmarks of the song. Flores signed away the US rights to the song but retained worldwide rights until his death.

There are many cover versions of the tune, including a jazz version by guitarist Wes Montgomery in 1966. It has also been recorded by rappers A.L.T. and XL Singleton. The Champs also had success with instrumentals such as &quot;Limbo Rock&quot; and &quot;El Rancho Rock&quot;. In 1985, &quot;Tequila&quot; featured prominently in the film &quot;Pee Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. The Champs also recorded a sequel to &quot;Tequila&quot; entitled &quot;Too Much Tequila&quot;.

=== 2020 band reunion ===
In 2020, group leader Burgess resurrected The Champs for a new album, &quot;Tequila Party&quot;, scheduled for November release. The LP contains 12 newly recorded tracks including a &quot;party&quot; rendition of their signature hit plus seven new compositions.

<text>Roger François Jouret (born 24 February 1954), better known as Plastic Bertrand, is a Belgian musician, songwriter, producer, editor and television presenter, best known for the 1977 international hit single &quot;&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and bands===

Jouret was born in Brussels to a French father and Ukrainian mother. At the age of nine, he became a singer and drummer in the Buffalo Scouts Band, a group he formed with the Boy Scouts, which performed covers of Rolling Stones songs. He then formed a band called The Pelicans, which performed at parties. They changed their name to Passing the Time, presenting their act in bars, in clubs and at festivals along the Dutch and Belgian coasts. Later he was hired by pirate radio station Radio Veronica.

Meanwhile, he continued his education at the Music Academy studying music theory and percussion, passing his degree at the Athénée Adolphe Max. Whilst awaiting admission to the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, he spent a year at the Saint-Luc Institute studying design.

In 1973, he entered the Conservatory to study music theory, percussion and music history. Influenced by the punk movement, he formed the band Hubble Bubble in 1974, sharing his time between study at the Conservatory, rehearsals and concerts with the band, and work as stage manager at the Theatre des Galeries. In 1975, Hubble Bubble released their first of two albums, also titled &quot;Hubble Bubble&quot;. Jouret is credited as the songwriter, singer and drummer under the name Roger Junior. The group&#x27;s bass player was killed in an accident returning from a rehearsal, and the group disbanded.

===As Plastic Bertrand===
In 1977, the manager of Hubble Bubble, Bernard Schol, introduced Roger Jouret to Lou Deprijck, who had just written the music for what would become two songs, &quot;Jet Boy, Jet Girl&quot; with English lyrics, and &quot;Ça plane pour moi&quot; with French lyrics. The French version became an international hit for Jouret, launching him as a solo artist under the new stage name of Plastic Bertrand. 

In addition to being the song&#x27;s co-writer and producer, Deprijck always maintained that he provided the vocals for the original recording, and the question remains controversial. In 2006 the Brussels court of appeal, upholding the decision of a lower court, found that Bertrand was the sole interpreter of the song. In 2010 an expert opinion produced for another case suggested the 1977 vocalist had a picard accent, like Deprijck&#x27;s. This did not, however, alter the 2006 ruling, and media statements by Deprijk to the effect that his claim to be the singer had been &quot;recognised by the justice system&quot; were ill-founded. (All of the proceedings between 2006 and 2010 arose from disputes between the record company AMC, which owned the catalogue of Plastic Bertrand&#x27;s Belgian label RKM, and Deprijck, whom it believed to be making inappropriate use of the material. Deprijck never took the question of who sang what to court himself.)

In an interview prompted by the 2010 episode, Bertrand appeared to admit that he was not the vocalist, but in a follow-up interview the next day he denied this, saying he was being ironic and had been trapped, and threatening legal action. This echoed a similar incident in the 1990s when Bertrand seemed to tell journalist Gilles Verlant that he was not the singer before quickly retracting. Since 2010, Bertrand has consistently said that he is the performer on the original recording, and this remains the position in law.

The song was recorded with the engineer Phil Delire for RKM/Vogue at Studio Morgan in Brussels. The English version, &quot;Jet Boy, Jet Girl&quot;, with totally unrelated lyrics by Alan Ward — soon to become Elton Motello — appeared around the same time. Both recordings featured the same core group of session musicians.

Plastic Bertrand toured Europe, Japan, Australia and North America with Lou Deprijck, becoming one of the few French-speaking artists to appear in the Billboard chart. He also appeared on a number of major television shows, presenting &quot;Jackpot&quot; on TF1, &quot;Destination Noël&quot; on France 2, &quot;Due per tutti&quot; on Rai 2 and &quot;Supercool&quot; on RTBF, which he also produced.

Between 1982 and 1985, he lived in Milan, and millions of Italians followed his adventures in a photo-story of which he was the star. With Daniel Balavoine and ABBA&#x27;s Anni-Frid Lyngstad, he recorded &quot;Abbacadabra&quot;, a musical tale for children. In the early 1980s, he appeared in movies such as &quot;Légitime violence&quot; and the short film &quot;Baoum&quot;. Working with Vladimir Cosma, he wrote several film scores, including &quot;Astérix et la surprise de César&quot; (&quot;Asterix Versus Caesar&quot;).

In 1987, he represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Amour, Amour&quot;. This failed to impress the juries, however, scoring only four points and placing 21st out of twenty-two entries.

During the 1990s, Bertrand explored other facets of music, including songwriting and producing, and also recorded the album &quot;Suite Diagonal&quot; for Sony in 1994 with Jacques Lanzmann. Forming the company MMD with Pierrette Broodthaers, he produced two albums for David Janssen, an album of classical music with a Turkish contemporary influence for harpsichord and organ with Leila Pinar, an album of traditional Balkan music with the Kazansky choir, and a single for Noël Godin, &quot;Chantilly c&#x27;est parti&quot;. Bertrand&#x27;s track &quot;Stop ou encore&quot; featured prominently in the 1999 film &quot;Three Kings&quot;.

&quot;&quot; is featured in the 1985 picture &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, in Danny Boyle&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;127 Hours&quot;, in 2011 as the opening title theme for &quot;Jackass 3.5&quot; (2011), in the 2012 film &quot;Ruby Sparks&quot;, in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, and in the trailer for the 2018 film &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;. The song is also used as the soundtrack for a commercial spot for Time Warner Cable in the United States (April 2011). A cover version was used in the 2018 video game, &quot;Just Dance 2019&quot;.

In 2023, Bertrand was a guest celebrity in the episode &quot;Snatch Game — Belgique Season 1&quot; of the Belgian French-language reality television series &quot;Drag Race Belgique&quot; broadcast on the Tipik.

===Comeback===
Twenty years after &quot;Ça plane pour moi&quot;, Bertrand returned to the public eye as MTV declared him the &quot;most wanted comeback artist&quot;. He made a guest appearance on the album &quot;Get Ready!&quot;, and rerecorded the 1982 song &quot;Stop ou encore&quot;, which went originally platinum in Belgium. A &quot;best of&quot; album was released in 1998 on the Universal-AMC label, Bertrand himself handling the remastering process.

Aside from a resurgence in his musical career, Plastic Bertrand made numerous guest appearances on European television, and presented the fortnightly show &quot;Duel&quot; for two seasons at RTBF. He also worked with Pierrette Broodthaers to open the &quot;Broodthaers &amp; Bertrand&quot; art gallery, and worked with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Valenciennes and Belgian artist Jacques Charlier to produce 120 Andy Warhol-style portraits.

In 2001, Bertrand toured Belgium, France, Switzerland and Germany with a series of concerts, and composed a number of new songs. He also made appearances on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Eurotrash&quot; show and BBC Two&#x27;s chat show &quot;Clarkson&quot;.

In 2002, he signed a new contract and recorded his eighth album &quot;Ultra terrestre&quot;, released in Belgium in 2002. In September and November the same year, he managed the TV talent contest &quot;Star Academy&quot; on RTL-TVI.

In March 2003, to celebrate 25 years since the beginning of his successful solo career, Bertrand performed a concert at the Cirque Royal in Brussels, performing new songs and past hits with a philharmonic orchestra, and singing in duet with guest singers.

From July to September 2003, he presented the TV show &quot;Hit Story&quot; on France 3. During his comeback, he appeared on a special 1980s edition of Le Maillon Faible, the French equivalent of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. He won €1,150 for charity. He appeared at the Countdown Spectacular 2 Tour from 18 August to 5 September 2007 in all major capital cities of Australia.

<doc id="762839" wikidata="Q3506776" url="?curid=762839" title="Sycan River">
<text>The Sycan River is a tributary, about long, of the Sprague River in the U.S. state of Oregon. The headwaters are in highlands in the Fremont National Forest south of Summer Lake. The river runs northwest into the Sycan Marsh in southern Lake County, from which it flows generally southwest to join the Sprague River near Beatty, in Klamath County. The uppermost of the stream are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

==Course==
Near its headwaters, the Sycan River, flowing west, receives Boulder Creek from the and the South Fork Sycan River from the . The Hanan Trail, a hiking path, runs roughly parallel to the river along this stretch, which is part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Turning northwest, the Sycan receives Rock, Kelly, and Nixon creeks from the right before turning west again. Over the next stretch, Cummings Creek enters from the right, Rifle Creek from the left, and the Sycan leaves Lake County and enters Klamath County. Skull Creek then enters from the left and Currier Creek from the right.

Downstream of Currier Creek, Paradise Creek enters from the left, and the Sycan turns northwest and then north, leaving Klamath County and re-entering Lake County. Slightly north of the border, Long Creek enters from the right. After turning west and southwest, the river enters Sycan Marsh, a wetland of about . Continuing southwest through the marsh, the river leaves Lake County and re-enters Klamath County. Further downstream, Merritt Creek enters from the left. Meandering west and then south, the Sycan receives Blue Creek from the left, enters Sprague River Valley, receives Snake Creek from the left, and enters the Sprague River north of Beatty.

==Recreation==
The river supports rainbow, brook, brown, and bull trout. The upper river offers good fly fishing for small brook trout, while brown trout are found only in the lower river downstream of the marsh. Rough forest roads provide access to parts of the lightly fished river. The lower is generally bordered by privately owned land, where permission is needed for access.

The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that owns most of the Sycan Marsh and some of the surrounding forest, offers self-guided automobile tours of the marsh. No hunting, fishing, camping, or pets are allowed in the preserve, which has no services and few opportunities for hiking. However, the marsh, attracting thousands of migrating tundra swans, sandhill cranes, yellow rails, black tern, white-faced ibises, and other species, offers opportunities for bird-watching. Access to the preserve is by unpaved forest roads.

<text>Carlton George Douglas (born 10 May 1942) is a Jamaican-British singer best known for his 1974 disco single &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;. Based in the United Kingdom, Douglas released three studio albums, including &quot;Kung Fu Fighting and Other Great Love Songs&quot; (1975).

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Kingston. He later lived in the U.S. state of California before relocating to London as a teenager. He spent his childhood in England playing football, and vocal training. In his youth, he developed a passion for soul music (citing Sam Cooke and Otis Redding as his biggest influences) and a trained tenor voice, which he would display in church singing various religious songs.

==Career==

Douglas&#x27;s career was based in the United Kingdom. His disco single &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;, produced by British-Indian songwriter, composer, and producer Biddu, ranked number one on both the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1974. The single sold 11 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The single was later certified gold by the RIAA on 27 November 1974.

The single, which is a homage to martial arts films, overshadowed the rest of Douglas&#x27; career, and has led to his appearance on other artists&#x27; versions of the song. In the United States, Douglas is considered a one-hit wonder, since he is commonly known only for &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; (its follow-up &quot;Dance the Kung Fu&quot; stalled at number 48). In the United Kingdom, two of his other singles made it into the top 40: &quot;Dance the Kung Fu&quot;, which peaked at number 35 in the charts, and &quot;Run Back&quot;, which peaked at number 25.

Douglas was once managed by Eric Woolfson, who later became the primary songwriter behind the Alan Parsons Project.

In 1998, a re-recording of &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;, performed by British dance act Bus Stop and which featured Douglas&#x27; vocals, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.

The single &quot;Dance the Kung Fu&quot; was sampled on &quot;Cuda nie widy&quot; from the 2001 album &quot;Nibylandia&quot; by Polish group Ego, and later by DJ Premier on his 2007 remix of Nike&#x27;s 25th Air Force One anniversary single &quot;Classic (Better Than I&#x27;ve Ever Been)&quot;, featuring Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One, and Rakim.

Douglas is represented by music publisher Schacht Musikverlage (SMV) in Hamburg, Germany.

<doc id="762841" wikidata="Q1780510" url="?curid=762841" title="Pseudo Echo">
<text>Pseudo Echo are an Australian New wave band formed in 1982 by Brian Canham (vocals, guitar, and keyboards), Pierre Gigliotti (bass keyboards and bass guitar), and Tony Lugton (keyboards). Later members included Anthony Argiro (drums), Vince Leigh (drums), and James Leigh (keyboards). In the 1980s, Pseudo Echo had multiple Australian top 20 hits with &quot;Listening&quot;, &quot;A Beat for You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Love an Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Living in a Dream&quot;. Their 1986 cover of &quot;Funky Town&quot; (a 1979 Disco hit by Lipps Inc.) was an international success, peaking at No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand and becoming a top ten hit in Sweden, Canada, the United States, and in the United Kingdom.

Their 1984 debut album, &quot;Autumnal Park&quot;, peaked at No. 11 on the Australian Kent Music Report. &quot;Love an Adventure&quot; followed in 1985 and reached No. 14. Their third album, &quot;Race&quot; (1988), peaked at No. 18. In 1990, the group disbanded. They reformed in 1998 and released the albums &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; (2014), &quot;Acoustica&quot;, and &quot;After Party&quot; (both 2020). Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane described the band as &quot;combin[ing] flash clothes, blow-wave hairstyles, youthful exuberance and accessible synth-pop to arrive at a winning combination&quot;.

==Biography==
=== 1982–1984: Formation and &quot;Autumnal Park&quot; ===

Pseudo Echo was formed in Melbourne in 1982 by two high school friends Brian Canham on vocals, guitars, and keyboards, and Pierre Gigliotti (as Pierre Pierre) on bass guitar and keyboards. They were later joined by Tony Lugton (ex-Steeler, James Freud &amp; the Radio Stars) on guitars and keyboards. The group were named for a sound effect available on their keyboards and were initially influenced by New Romantics bands, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Ultravox. Molly Meldrum, television presenter and talent co-ordinator for the pop music series &quot;Countdown&quot;, saw the group at a gig and aired them on his show with a demo version of &quot;Listening&quot; in June 1983. Originally the three-piece group had used a drum machine until Anthony Argiro joined on drums in July.

The band were signed to EMI Records and &quot;Listening&quot; – re-recorded and produced by Peter Dawkins – was issued in November as their debut single. It peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Their debut album, &quot;Autumnal Park&quot;, produced by Dawkins and John Punter, was released in June 1984 and peaked at No. 11 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. The album was released as &quot;Pseudo Echo&quot; for the North American market. It yielded the singles &quot;A Beat for You&quot; (No. 12 in April), &quot;Dancing Until Midnight&quot;, and &quot;Stranger in Me&quot;. Another track from &quot;Autumnal&quot;, &quot;His Eyes&quot;, was used in the horror film, &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot; (1985). In October 1984, Tony Lugton left the band due to musical differences, and was replaced by James Leigh (aka James Dingli) on keyboards. Lugton eventually joined synth rock band Talk That Walk.

=== 1985–1990: &quot;Love an Adventure&quot;, &quot;Funky Town&quot;, &quot;Race&quot;, and disbandment===

In November 1985, Pseudo Echo released their second album, &quot;Love an Adventure&quot;. It was co-produced by Brian Canham and Mark S. Berry. Another line-up change occurred after its recording with Argiro replaced by James&#x27; brother Vince Leigh (aka Vincent Dingli) on drums. The album reached No. 14 in Australia. Three of its singles reached the Top 20 including &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (No. 4 in October), &quot;Love an Adventure&quot; (No. 6 in January 1986), and &quot;Living in a Dream&quot; (No. 15 in May). A fourth single, &quot;Try&quot; (August), peaked at No. 60. In November 1985, Canham was part of the supergroup the Incredible Penguins, who recorded a cover of the John Lennon and Yoko Ono hit &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; for charity; it peaked at No. 10 in December. 

In November 1986, Pseudo Echo released a cover version of the Lipps Inc. disco song &quot;Funky Town&quot;, which spent seven weeks at number one from December. &quot;Funky Town&quot; brought Pseudo Echo their biggest international chart success. It reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1987, No. 1 in Canada, (No. 17 on Canadian 1987 Year End) and No. 1 in New Zealand. While not initially included on &quot;Love an Adventure&quot;, &quot;Funky Town&quot; was included on reissues of the album that were released following the success of the single. In September 1986, James and Vince Leigh appeared in the music video for John Farnham&#x27;s single, &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; despite not contributing to its audio recording.

In 1987, the band re-released their 1983 debut single &quot;Listening&quot; for the movie &quot;North Shore&quot;. In October, they won the 1987 World Popular Song Festival with &quot;Take on the World&quot;, which provided a prize of US$10,000. They released the compilation album &quot;Long Plays 83–87&quot;, re-titled &quot;Funky Town - The Album&quot; in New Zealand, where it peaked at No. 1. In 1988, they released their third studio album &quot;Race&quot;. It was produced by Canham, Brian Malouf and Julian Mendelsohn. It spawned the Australian singles &quot;Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Over Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;. The album reached No. 18 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart and No. 32 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Pseudo Echo disbanded after touring in support of &quot;Race&quot; in 1990.

=== 1990–1997: Other projects ===
After Pseudo Echo disbanded, in 1990, bassist Pierre Gigliotti joined All the Young Dudes with former Geisha lead singer Chris Doheny. Lead singer Brian Canham moved into record production, and produced Chocolate Starfish&#x27;s 1994 debut album, &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The Leigh brothers had a stint backing Tina Arena before forming Vertigo (later renamed as Invertigo) in 1996 with a third brother, Gerry Leigh on guitar. In 1997, Canham formed Brill with Darren Danielson (ex-Chocolate Starfish) on drums. Andy McIvor was added on bass guitar and Dave Stuart on keyboards, and they toured as Brill, which issued a self-titled album in August 1997.

=== 1998–2011: Reformation, &quot;Teleporter&quot; &amp; the return of Vince &amp; James Leigh ===

Pseudo Echo reunited in March 1998, with Canham and Gigliotti joined by Danielson on drums and Tony Featherstone on keyboards (ex-the Badloves), and toured Australia. In late 1999, Ben Grayson replaced Featherstone on keyboards. In 2000, they released &quot;Funkytown Y2K: RMX&quot; which included six new remixes of &quot;Funky Town&quot;. In February of that year, they supported international visitors Culture Club and Village People on the Retro Event of the New Millenium tour. In 2000, Pseudo Echo released &quot;Teleporter&quot;, a compilation of new tracks, remixes, and live performances. During 2002 Canham and Grayson were part of the dance pop group Origene with vocalist Matilda White. Their debut single, &quot;Suddenly, Silently&quot; (March 2002), peaked at No. 51 on the ARIA Singles chart.

In 2005, Pseudo Echo toured extensively with Idols of the 80s and released &quot;Autumnal Park – Live&quot;. In 2006, Canham performed at the &quot;Countdown Spectacular&quot;. In 2007, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Pseudo Echo, Canham and Gigliotti were joined by previous members James and Vince Leigh for a sold-out show at the Crown Casino, Melbourne. This performance was followed by a short Australian tour before Canham and Gigliotti were rejoined by latter day members, Danielson and Grayson.

=== 2012–2021: &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, &quot;Acoustica&quot;, &quot;After Party&quot;, &amp; &quot;1990: The Lost Album Demos&quot; ===

In 2012, co-founder Gigliotti resigned from the band and was replaced by Simon Rayner (bass keys, backing vocals).
In July 2012, Pseudo Echo released &quot;Suddenly Silently&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Fighting the Tide&quot; in 2013. In 2014, the band undertook a successful crowd-funding campaign which enabled them to release their fourth studio album, &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;. The band toured &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; extensively across Australia and to New Zealand. In January 2015, the group recorded a live performance in Hollywood&#x27;s Viper Room in front of a sold-out crowd. This was released as &quot;Live at the Viper Room&quot; in June 2015. In December 2017, the group released a cover of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;.

In May 2020, the group released their fifth studio album, the acoustic album &quot;Acoustica&quot;, which was followed by the release of their sixth studio album &quot;After Party&quot; in September of the same year. In June 2021, the group released the album &quot;1990: The Lost Album Demos&quot;, a compilation of songs that Brian Canham demoed in 1989 for what would have been Pseudo Echo&#x27;s fourth studio album.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Ultimate&quot; &amp; &quot;New lineup&quot; ===
In late 2022, Pseudo Echo tour entitled &quot;The Ultimate Tour&quot; to promote the compilation album released on that year. In July 2024, the lineup consists of Brian Canham, Matty Ray, James Mudd, Abigail Lula, &amp; new backing vocalist Valentina Taylor.

<text>Joseph Dolce (, originally ; born October 13, 1947) is an American-Australian singer, songwriter, poet and essayist.

Dolce achieved international recognition with his multi-million-selling novelty song, &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot;, released worldwide under the name of his one-man show, Joe Dolce Music Theatre, in 1980–1981. The single reached number one in 15 countries. It has sold more than 450,000 copies in Australia and continues to be the most successful Australian-produced single worldwide, selling an estimated six million copies. It reached No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart for eight weeks from November 1980.

==Life and career==
===1947–1977: Early years===
Dolce was born in 1947 in Painesville, Ohio, the eldest of three children to Italian-American parents. He graduated from Thomas W. Harvey High School in 1965. During his senior year, he played the lead role of Mascarille in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Précieuses Ridicules&quot; for a production staged by the French Club of Lake Erie College, which was his first time on stage, acting and singing an impromptu song he created from the script. The play was well-received and his performance was noted by director Jake Rufli, who later invited him to be part of his production of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Eurydice&quot;.

His co-star in &quot;Les Précieuses Ridicules&quot; was a sophomore on a creative writing scholarship at Lake Erie College, Carol Dunlop, who introduced him to folk music, poetry and the writings of William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Dunlop later married the Argentine novelist Julio Cortázar. Dolce attended Ohio University, majoring in architecture, from 1965 to 1967 before deciding to become a professional musician.

While attending college at Ohio University, in Athens, Ohio, he formed various bands including Headstone Circus, with Jonathan Edwards who subsequently went on as a solo artist to have a charting hit song in the US (&quot;Sunshine&quot;). Edwards subsequently recorded five Dolce songs including, &quot;Athens County&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Along&quot;, &quot;King of Hearts&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Upsy Daisy&quot; and &quot;My Home Ain&#x27;t in the Hall of Fame&quot;, the latter song becoming an alt country classic, also recorded by Robert Earl Keen, Rosalie Sorrels, JD Crowe &amp; the New South and many others.

===1978–1984: Move to Australia, &quot;Boat People&quot; and &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot;===
Dolce relocated to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, in 1978 and his first single there was &quot;Boat People&quot;—a protest song on the poor treatment of Vietnamese refugees—which was translated into Vietnamese and donated to the fledgling Vietnamese community starting to form in Melbourne. His one-man show, Joe Dolce Music Theatre, was performed in cabarets and pubs with various line-ups, including his longtime partner, Lin Van Hek.

In July 1980, he recorded the self-penned &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot;, for the Full Moon Records label, at Mike Brady&#x27;s new studios in West Melbourne. When in Ohio, Dolce would sometimes visit his Italian grandparents and extended family—they used the phrases &quot;What&#x27;s the matter, you?&quot; and &quot;Eh, shaddap&quot;, which Dolce adapted and used in the song. He wrote the song about Italians living in Australia and first performed it at Marijuana House, Brunswick Street, Fitzroy in 1979. It became a multi-million-selling hit, peaking at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart for eight weeks from November 1980, in the UK from February 1981 for three weeks, and also No. 1 in Germany, France, Fiji, Puerto Rico, the Canadian province of Quebec, Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland. Dolce received the Advance Australia Award in 1981. The song has had hundreds of cover versions over the decades including releases by artists as diverse as Lou Monte, Sheila (France), Andrew Sachs (Manuel, of Fawlty Towers), actor Samuel L. Jackson and hip-hop legend KRS-One. In 2018, the first Russian language version was released by two of Moscow&#x27;s most popular singers, Kristina Orbakaite and Philipp Kirkorov. The song has been translated into fifteen languages, including an aboriginal dialect.

By February 1981, it had become Australia&#x27;s best-selling single ever selling 290,000 copies, entering the Guinness Book of World Records and surpassing the previous record of 260,000 copies by Brady&#x27;s own &quot;Up There Cazaly&quot;.

&quot;Shaddap You Face&quot; has continued to be licensed and recorded by other artists and companies since its release in 1980 with its most recent appearance, in 2021, as part of the US series &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (aka, &quot;Morning Wars&quot; in Australia.)

Follow up single, &quot;If You Wanna Be Happy&quot; was released in 1981 and charted in Australia and New Zealand. In December 1981, Dolce released the album &quot;Christmas in Australia&quot;, which peaked at number 92 on the Australian chart.

===1984–present===
With Lin Van Hek, he formed various performance groups including Skin the Wig, La Somnambule (1984) and the ongoing Difficult Women (1993). Van Hek and Dolce co-wrote &quot;Intimacy&quot;, for the soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot;, now part of the US Library of Congress collection. He was a featured lead actor in the Australian film &quot;Blowing Hot and Cold&quot; (1988). He has continued to perform solo and with Van Hek as part of their music-literary cabaret Difficult Women.

In 2010, two of his photos were selected for publication in the US journal, &quot;Tupelo Quarterly&quot;.

Since 2009, he has been a prolifically published poet in Australia. In 2010, he won the 25th Launceston Poetry Cup at the Tasmanian Poetry Festival. His poems were selected for Best Australian Poems 2014 &amp; 2015. He was the winner of the 2017 University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Health Poetry Prize, for a choral libretto, longlisted in the same year for the University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Poetry Prize and included in the Irises anthology. He longlisted for the 2018 University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Poetry Prize and was included in the Silence anthology. He was Highly Commended for the 2020 ACU Poetry Prize and included in the Generosity anthology. He was selected as the August 2020 City of Melbourne Poet Laureate.

Since 2018, he has been the television and film reviews editor for &quot;Quadrant&quot; magazine.

<doc id="762846" wikidata="Q233377" url="?curid=762846" title="Amerie">
<text>Amerie Mi Marie Rogers Nicholson (born January 12, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and writer. She has released four studio albums to date: &quot;All I Have&quot; (2002), &quot;Touch&quot; (2005), &quot;Because I Love It&quot; (2007), &quot;In Love &amp; War&quot; (2009). She is best known for her 2005 single &quot;1 Thing&quot;.

== Early life ==
Rogers was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, to a Korean mother named Mi Suk and an African American father, Charles Rogers. A few months after she was born, the Rogers family moved to South Korea, where Amerie lived for three years. Her father was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. military, so the family lived in many different places, including Alaska, Texas, Virginia and Germany. She has a younger sister, Angela Rogers, who is now her lawyer.

Amerie has described her parents as conservative, protective, traditional Christians. Growing up, she and her sister were forbidden to leave the house or use the phone on school days. The singer enrolled at Georgetown University to study literature, and was in Navy ROTC: &quot;My dad didn&#x27;t force me into it or anything. I joined so I could afford an education.&quot; She quit ROTC after her sophomore year and graduated with a B.A. in English and a Fine Arts minor in design.

While studying at Georgetown, Amerie befriended a Washington, D.C., club promoter who eventually put her in touch with producer Rich Harrison. During an interview with Maxim Magazine, Amerie said she agreed to meet up with Rich at a public location because she did not know Rich. The chosen location was a McDonald&#x27;s parking lot, where Rich played his tracks and Amerie sang along. Instantly they knew it was something special.

Harrison, who had just worked on Mary J. Blige&#x27;s albums &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;No More Drama&quot;, began recording and developing demos with Amerie. This led to her first record deal with Columbia Records. According to Amerie, she and Harrison immediately hit it off. In a 2002 Interview with Hip Online, she said: &quot;For some reason we had a very special chemistry. When we would work together something great would happen.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 2001–2003: &quot;All I Have&quot; ===

Amerie recorded the chorus for the 2001 single &quot;Rule&quot;, performed by Nas. The single peaked at number 67 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart in the United States. She recorded a song with Detroit rapper Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;, titled &quot;Life&quot;, the third and final single from his album &quot;Rock City (Version 2.0)&quot;. In 2002, her debut single, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Fall in Love&quot;, was released and peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming a top ten hit on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts. The song was an urban top-20 hit in Australia and reached the top 40 in the UK.

Amerie&#x27;s debut album, &quot;All I Have&quot; (produced and co-written in its entirety by Rich Harrison), was released in 2002 to generally positive reviews. It peaked at number nine on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 89,000 copies in its first week of release; the album has since been certified gold by the RIAA and had sold 657,000 copies by 2009, according to Nielsen SoundScan. To promote the album, Amerie went on tour with Usher and Nas—on the former&#x27;s Evolution 8701 Tour—and with rapper Nelly. The second and final single from &quot;All I Have&quot; was &quot;Talkin&#x27; to Me&quot;, a top-20 entry on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, although it peaked outside the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2003, Amerie won the Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist and was also nominated for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album (&quot;All I Have&quot;) and Best R&amp;B Soul Single – Female (&quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Fall in Love&quot;). She received a BET Award nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Artist and an Image Award nomination for Outstanding New Artist. Amerie lent her vocals to the LL Cool J song &quot;Paradise&quot;, which reached number 14 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and became the singer&#x27;s second top-40 Hot 100 entry. She was featured on DJ Kayslay&#x27;s &quot;Too Much for Me&quot;, on his 2003 album &quot;The Streetsweeper Vol. 1&quot;, which peaked at number 53 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Amerie appeared on Bow Wow&#x27;s third album, &quot;Unleashed&quot;, singing the hook on the song &quot;To My Mama&quot;. She was also featured on the Rodney Jerkins-produced track &quot;When I Think of You&quot; from the soundtrack to the Jessica Alba dance film &quot;Honey&quot;.

=== 2004–2005: &quot;Touch&quot; ===

Amerie gained additional recognition from her first acting role, in the 2004 film &quot;First Daughter&quot; (directed by Forest Whitaker), in which she starred alongside Katie Holmes. Also in 2004, she began working on her second album, &quot;Touch&quot;. As with &quot;All I Have&quot;, the album was co-written and produced by friend Rich Harrison, who contributed seven new tracks to the record; additional production came from Lil Jon, Bryce Wilson, Red Spyda, and Dre &amp; Vidal. Unlike her first album, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, &quot;Come with Me&quot;, which Harrison wrote. She assumed more creative control over the visual imagery accompanying the album, such as videos and artwork—&quot;I feel like when you do a record, you have a vision in your mind and you want to carry it across and it doesn&#x27;t end with the studio&quot;, she has said.

In 2005, Amerie released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;1 Thing&quot;. The dance-pop song, which sampled The Meters&#x27;s 1970s funk recording &quot;Oh, Calcutta!&quot;, became Amerie&#x27;s biggest hit to date. In the United States, it reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The RIAA certified the single gold. The song was a top-five hit in the UK, where it became one of the year&#x27;s best-selling singles, and attained top-ten and top-twenty positions across Continental Europe.

&quot;Touch&quot; was released in 2005 and peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 124,000 copies in its first week. The album was certified gold by the RIAA, having sold 406,000 copies in the United States as of 2009. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Touch&quot;, was released as the second single and peaked at number 95 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States, although it was a top-20 entry in the UK. A third single, &quot;Talkin&#x27; About&quot;, was released in America only; an official music video was planned but eventually scrapped. Later in 2005, Amerie was featured alongside Fat Joe on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, the lead single from Ricky Martin&#x27;s album &quot;Life&quot;. The single entered the top 20 in several European countries and Australia.

The success of &quot;1 Thing&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot; led to two Grammy Award nominations for Amerie in 2006: Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance (for &quot;1 Thing&quot;), and Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album (for &quot;Touch&quot;). &quot;1 Thing&quot; earned nominations at the MTV Video Music Awards—for Best Female Video and Best Choreography—and Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards— for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Solo; R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year; Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video; and Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Dance Cut. At the 2005 &quot;VIBE&quot; Awards, Amerie won Club Banger of the Year for her hit. &quot;1 Thing&quot; was adapted into a variety of remixes by rappers such as Eve, Fabolous, and Jay-Z. In 2009, &quot;1 Thing&quot; was sixth on &quot;The Root&quot;″s list of Top 10 Hip-Hop/R&amp;B Songs of the 2000s.

=== 2006–2007: &quot;Because I Love It&quot; ===

In 2006, Amerie returned to the studio to work on her third album, &quot;Because I Love It&quot;, with producers such as The Buchanans, One Up, and Mike Caren. The album was her first not to feature writing and production from producer Rich Harrison. She cited music of the 1980s as a major influence on the album, saying &quot;I love 80s music period! That&#x27;s why I did &quot;Because I Love It&quot;, since it had mostly R&amp;B, soul, and 80s new wave. When I said I wanted to do that in 2006, people were like, &#x27;what?!&#x27; [...] but I love it.&quot;

&quot;Because I Love It&quot;&#x27;s first single, &quot;Take Control&quot;, (co-produced by Mike Caren and co-written by Cee-Lo Green), became a top-10 hit in the UK in 2007. &quot;Because I Love It&quot; was released in 2007 in Europe, Asia, and Australasia and reached the top 20 in the UK, where the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Gotta Work&quot;, peaked at number 21. The album has been certified silver by the BPI. During 2007, the impending U.S. release of &quot;Because I Love It&quot; made &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;25 Reasons to Love &#x27;07&quot;. The official release date was delayed several times and the singles &quot;Take Control&quot; and &quot;Gotta Work&quot; were given little promotion (with the former peaking at number 66 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart). Amerie spoke of her difficulties with Columbia Records in a late 2007 interview, stating that the label was not promoting &quot;Because I Love It&quot; adequately.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;In Love &amp; War&quot; ===
In 2008, Amerie announced she had signed a label/production deal through the Island Def Jam Music Group, which allowed her to release her music under her own label, Feenix Rising. Later that year, Columbia Records released the compilation album &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Amerie&quot;; in 2009, the label released a second compilation album, &quot;Best 15 Things&quot;, in Japan only.

Amerie described her fourth album, &quot;In Love &amp; War&quot;, as &quot;a fusion of hip-hop, soul, and rock&quot; with elements of music of the 1970s, and &quot;a direct extension of my first album [&quot;All I Have&quot;]&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Why R U&quot;, reached number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the U.S. &quot;Heard &#x27;Em All&quot;, which featured rapper Lil Wayne, peaked at number 81 on the same chart; it did, however, enter the top 10 on the Korean pop charts. With little radio support—the third single, &quot;Pretty Brown&quot; (featuring Trey Songz), was released only two weeks before the album—and hindered by distribution problems, &quot;In Love &amp; War&quot; peaked at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

In 2010, Amerie announced that she had changed the spelling of her stage name to Ameriie, explaining: &quot;I operate on vibes and intuition, and I believe everything is energy; the vibration of the double I is right for me. Slightly different spelling, completely same pronunciation!&quot; Later that year, she premiered a new song titled &quot;Outside Your Body&quot;.

=== 2011–present: &quot;BILI&quot;, &quot;Cymatika&quot; trilogy and independent releases ===
In 2011, it was reported that Amerie was in the studio working on her fifth studio album, titled &quot;Cymatika Vol. 1&quot;. The album&#x27;s title is based on the word &quot;cymatics&quot;, the study of visible sound and vibration. The production lineup consisted of Riley Urick, The Buchanans, and Andre Harris (of Dre &amp; Vidal), among others; Amerie said that she may reunite with Rich Harrison for the project but that it would be &quot;a matter of when and in what way.&quot; &quot;Cymatika Vol. 1&quot; was also to include special guest appearances from Drunken Tiger&#x27;s Tiger JK and Tasha Reid. According to Amerie, &quot;Cymatika&quot; would explore freedom, androgyny, and the New world order, and was influenced by trance music, electronica, house music, and New wave music. Second and third volumes of &quot;Cymatika&quot; were planned.

In 2012, Amerie announced a forthcoming &quot;mini-LP&quot; titled &quot;The Prelude&quot;. In 2013, she stated that she had been working on a new project, &quot;Because I Love It Vol. II&quot;, a follow-up to her 2007 album. She said this album, &quot;BILI&quot;, stemmed from songs that did not fit sonically or thematically onto &quot;Cymatika&quot;—&quot;songs that are heavy in percussion, but have a very aggressive, soulful element to them. They don&#x27;t exist in any one time, or sound of the moment&quot;. &quot;BILI&quot; and &quot;Cymatika&quot; were both slated for release in 2015. A single, &quot;What I Want&quot; (which samples &quot;Apache&quot; by Incredible Bongo Band), was released from &quot;BILI&quot; in 2014. Later in 2014, she premiered the track &quot;Mustang&quot; and announced a UK tour for 2015. In 2015, Amerie collaborated with producer Rich Harrison on a new single, &quot;Out Loud&quot;.

In 2016, Amerie appeared on the radio show The Breakfast Club, 105.1 and announced an EP titled &quot;Drive&quot;, a second untitled EP due later in the year, and that she was still at work on her album &quot;Cymatika&quot; (which was to be part of a trilogy). &quot;Drive&quot; was initially released on the streaming service SoundCloud. In 2017, Amerie released the single &quot;REDRUM&quot;, which was set to be featured on an upcoming album titled &quot;MA3&quot;.

In 2018, Amerie simultaneously released two albums, &quot;4AM Mulholland&quot; and &quot;After 4AM&quot;; this was her first full-length album since 2009 and her second independent release (following &quot;Drive&quot;). In 2019, she performed alongside Nelly and Craig David at R&#x27;n&#x27;B Vine Days, a one-day music festival in Australia.

In August 2022, it was announced that Amerie&#x27;s children&#x27;s picture book, &quot;You Will Do Great Things&quot;, was due to be published by Macmillan in March 2023.

== Artistry ==
Since the start of her career, Amerie has been heavily involved within the creative process of her music, receiving not only writing credits but production and instrumentation credits as well. Amerie is a soprano.

In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: &quot;I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. I would start by recording myself on the first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, I would play it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them on the second tape. I&#x27;d just keep repeating the process, going back and forth between tapes until I had a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!&quot;.

Amerie listed diverse musical influences in a 2014 interview, including the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, Motown era soul music, late 1960s rock and roll, Heavy metal music, 1980s pop music and new wave music, music of Germany, Korean traditional music, R&amp;B, and hip hop music. She cited film score as an inspiration, describing them as &quot;that very surround-sound, immersive experience&quot;.

While she almost exclusively releases English-language songs, Amerie has recorded with Korean artists such as 4minute on &quot;Heard &#x27;em All&quot;, a performance of which aired on KBS and Mnet.

== Other projects ==
In 2003, Amerie was the presenter of the BET teen/youth lifestyle series &quot;The Center&quot;, which she also helped to develop. In 2004, Amerie earned her first acting role, portraying the role of Mia Thompson, a college student who rooms with the president&#x27;s daughter, in the film &quot;First Daughter&quot;, alongside Katie Holmes.

In 2014, Amerie launched a YouTube video blog titled &quot;Books Beauty Ameriie&quot; and said that she was writing two novels, one young adult and one fantasy.

In 2017, Amerie published an anthology book via Bloomsbury Publishing titled &quot;Because You Love to Hate Me&quot; and a sci-fi trilogy novel series.

In 2019, Amerie started her own Book Club, &quot;Amerie&#x27;s Book Club&quot; where she highlights diverse and unique perspectives and voices.

In 2019, Amerie performed on tour with other artists such as Ashanti, Keri Hilson, and Monica for the Femme It Forward movement.

== Personal life ==
In 2007, Amerie began dating her manager, Sony Music executive Lenny Nicholson. It was officially announced that Amerie and Nicholson were engaged on February 27, 2010, and the couple married on June 25, 2011, in an oceanfront ceremony in Anguilla. She now goes by Amerie Nicholson or Amerie Rogers Nicholson. On May 15, 2018, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a son.

In 2024, Amerie became a Muslim and celebrated Eid Al-Fitr, with fans speculating her advocacy for Palestine inspired her to embrace the religion.

<text>Stargate (often stylized in all caps) is a military science fiction media franchise owned by Amazon MGM Studios. It is based on the film directed by Roland Emmerich, which he co-wrote with producer Dean Devlin; production company StudioCanal owns the rights to the original film. The franchise is based on the idea of an alien wormhole (specifically an Einstein–Rosen bridge) device (the Stargate) that enables nearly instantaneous travel across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film &quot;Stargate&quot;, released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197million worldwide. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; in 2004, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; in 2009, and a prequel web series, &quot;Stargate Origins&quot;, in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies &quot;Stargate: Children of the Gods&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.

In 2011, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, the last &quot;Stargate&quot; program on television ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran for more than 15 years, including 18 seasons (364 episodes) of programming, and 22 comic book issues as of January 2020. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or reset it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;.

In 2017, the franchise was briefly revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, &quot;Stargate Origins&quot;. Episodes premiered on a central &quot;fan hub&quot; for the franchise called Stargate Command, with a single season of ten 10-minute episodes.

== Premise ==

The &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise is built around the in-universe titular device of the Stargate, a ring-shaped device built by an ancient intergalactic race of beings that allows almost instantaneous travel across vast distances via wormholes that can be &quot;dialed&quot; between any two Stargates on the network. The shows themselves are typically set contemporaneous to when they were made, featuring real-world or &quot;realistic&quot; technologies in an otherwise science-fiction setting. Most incarnations of the franchise follow a similar structure, following the exploits of the lead expeditionary team of the show&#x27;s setting on various one-off or season-arc continuing episodes, with major differences being the principal setting and main villains faced.

== Franchise releases ==
Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various &quot;Stargate&quot; productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official canon, the largest following exists for the three live-action series.

=== Game releases ===

* &quot;Stargate: Timekeepers&quot; is a live strategy video game in development since May 2021 for the PC from Slitherine and CreativeForge Games.

* In 2021, Wyvern Gaming produced another Stargate SG-1 RPG, built on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e system. Similar to the Alderac-produced game, it and the adventure modules published for it were considered canon, but again a purchase - this time Amazon Studios&#x27; purchase of MGM - interrupted or killed the licensing and subsequent development of game expansions.

* A Stargate pinball game was produced by Gottlieb.

== &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise timeline ==
== Theatrical films ==

=== &quot;Stargate&quot; ===

The titular 1994 film &quot;Stargate&quot;, directed by Roland Emmerich and co-written by Emmerich and Dean Devlin, focuses on the initial &quot;re-discovery&quot; of the Stargate on Earth and the first expedition off-world. The film sees a team led by Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neil (Kurt Russell) and including Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) venture through the Stargate to the planet of Abydos, finding a society of ancient Egyptian-speaking humans ruled by a space-faring alien posing in the role of the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra. The expedition eventually liberates the society from the control of the alien, killing it in the process, before the survivors (bar Daniel, who had ingrained himself with the locals) return to Earth.

== Television ==

=== &quot;SG-1&quot; ===
In 1997, Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright co-developed &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O&#x27;Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra &quot;L&quot;). The setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to Stargate Command which was based in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The show for the first eight seasons initially focused on efforts by Stargate Command to combat the Goa&#x27;uld, the race of beings to whom the alien calling itself Ra had belonged to, and their leaders known as the System Lords while liberating both the human populations they had enslaved throughout the galaxy as well as their enslaved armies of mutated humans known as the Jaffa. For the final two seasons the show moved to a new threat, the Ori, which were inspired by Arthurian legend.

The series debuted on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci-Fi Channel after its fifth season. It starred Richard Dean Anderson (as O&#x27;Neill) and Michael Shanks (as Jackson), alongside Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis respectively playing the new characters Samantha Carter, Teal&#x27;c and George Hammond. The cast remained fairly regular for most of &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s run, but experienced some changes. Michael Shanks left the show at the end of Season5 and was replaced by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season7 Davis left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season9 saw the departure of Anderson, but added new regulars Beau Bridges and Ben Browder. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, Claudia Black&#x27;s popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.

MGM put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regarded it as one of its most important franchises. &quot;SG-1&quot; was taken off air in 2007; however, two direct-to-DVD movies entitled &quot;The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum&quot; were made to tie up loose ends.

==== &quot;The Ark of Truth&quot;, &quot;Continuum&quot; and &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; ====

&quot;&quot; is a direct-to-DVD movie written and directed by Robert C. Cooper. The film is the conclusion of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;&#x27;s Ori arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. &quot;The Ark of Truth&quot; was released as a Region1 DVD release on March 11, 2008. Sky One has broadcast the film on March 24, 2008, to be followed by the Region2 DVD release on April 28, 2008, with the Region4 DVD release on April 9, 2008.

&quot;&quot; is a direct-to-DVD movie written by Brad Wright and directed by Martin Wood. Some scenes for this movie were already shot at the end of March 2007, but the original start date was set for May 22 at Vancouver&#x27;s Bridge Studios. The production budget was $7million. The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008. The Region4 DVD was released on August 6, 2008, with the Region2 DVD released on August 18, 2008; followed by possible TV broadcasts. The film is a time-travel adventure and is the second sequel to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, after &quot;Stargate: The Ark of Truth&quot;.

&quot;Stargate: Children of the Gods&quot; is a direct-to-DVD movie written by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright and directed by Mario Azzopardi.
The &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; pilot episode was re-cut as a third &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; direct-to-DVD special and released on July 21, 2009, by MGM Home Entertainment in 16:9 widescreen format. A few months before its release, executive producer Brad Wright announced it would be enhanced with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version. The beginning was to be slightly altered, a new scene added, and the nudity scene taken out to make this episode suitable for children, with the final movie roughly seven minutes shorter than the original episode.

=== &quot;Atlantis&quot; ===

&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was a spin-off television series from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of &quot;SG-1&quot;. Later, &quot;SG-1&quot; was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season. Finally, when &quot;SG-1&quot; was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part season finale episode &quot;Lost City&quot;, and the setting of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was moved to the Pegasus galaxy. This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same fictional universe, and later the two shows even become interconnected. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as &quot;SG-1&quot;.

The series follows the adventures of the &quot;Atlantis expedition&quot;, an international combination of military forces and civilian scientists who travel to the Pegasus Galaxy in search of the Lost City of Atlantis, built by the ancient race of beings who had built the Stargates. Throughout the five-year run the show mostly focused on the expedition fighting an alien species known as the Wraith, who are required to periodically feed on humans to survive and for thousands of years terrorised the humans of the galaxy, all while preventing their new foes from reaching the Milky Way.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring Joe Flanigan and Torri Higginson in the lead roles, with Rainbow Sun Francks, David Hewlett, and Rachel Luttrell alongside. Hewlett and Higginson&#x27;s characters had previously appeared in &quot;SG-1&quot; (though Higginson inherited the role from actress Jessica Steen). In &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; second season, Paul McGillion and Jason Momoa (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and Jewel Staite in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for Season5 to concentrate on &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, and was replaced by Robert Picardo, who reprised his role as Richard Woolsey from both &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;. However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.

=== &quot;Universe&quot; ===
&quot;Stargate Universe&quot; is the third live-action &quot;Stargate&quot; series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the Sci Fi Channel in the fall of 2007, just before the writer&#x27;s strikewhich put a hold on the project. &quot;The pitch was received very well,&quot; according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered &quot;Universe&quot; after announcing the cancellation of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Syfy announced on December 16, 2010, that they would not pick the show up for a third season. The final episode aired May 9, 2011.

The shows focuses on an expedition being stranded several billion light years from Earth on board an Ancient ship called &quot;Destiny,&quot; which has been traveling through the universe uncrewed for millions of years. The show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board &quot;Destiny&quot; with no apparent way home. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors and delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other.

=== &quot;Stargate Origins&quot; ===
In July 2017, a web series called &quot;Stargate Origins&quot; was announced at a San Diego Comic-Con Panel celebrating the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It focuses on the character of Catherine Langford and is a prequel both to the television continuity and to the original feature film. The shooting began in August 2017 and series premiered online at the Stargate Command website on February 15, 2018.

The cast includes Ellie Gall as the young Catherine Langford, Connor Trinneer as Catherine&#x27;s father, Professor Paul Langford, Aylam Orian as Dr. Wilhelm Brücke, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Philip Alexander as Captain James Beal, British officer stationed in Egypt, and Shvan Aladdin as Wasif, a native Egyptian and a lieutenant in the British army.

=== &quot;Infinity&quot; ===

&quot;Stargate Infinity&quot; is an American animated science fiction television series created by Eric Lewald and Michael Maliani as a spin-off from its sister show, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. The story arc in &quot;Infinity&quot; is set 30 years into the future and follows Gus Bonner and his team. Bonner&#x27;s team was created after he was framed for a crime he did not commit. He escaped from Stargate Command (SGC) after the hostile alien race Tlak&#x27;kahn attacked the SGC to find the chrysalis. Together with his team he escapes through the Stargate with the chrysalis. From that point forward they go from planet to planet until they find the evidence to clear their names while learning about the unique cultures in the galaxy, so that they can one day return to Earth. The story arc was never resolved because of low viewership ratings and the show was cancelled in 2003.

&quot;Stargate Infinity&quot; premiered in September 2002 as part of 4Kids Entertainment&#x27;s FOX BOX Saturday morning line-up on FOX and went off the air in June 2003. Due to its lack of popularity the show is almost completely unrecognized. The series was cancelled before any of its story arcs could be resolved. The show was of low budget, which was constantly noted by the media. DIC Entertainment released a 4-episode DVD on October 7, 2003, in Region1. MGM Home Entertainment released a five disc season box set on August 13, 2007, in Region2. Shout! Factory, a company known for releasing cult animated series, acquired the rights to the show and released the entire series to DVD on May 13, 2008, in Region1. , there is yet to come a release of &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot; package in Region4, namely Oceania and Latin America.

The writers and producers of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; and the main canon of the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise were not involved with &quot;Infinity&quot;, and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of &quot;Stargate&quot; consider &quot;Infinity&quot; to be an official part of the &quot;Stargate&quot; universe. According to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; co-creator Brad Wright, the animated series should not be considered official &quot;Stargate&quot; canon. Commenting on it, he stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. I&#x27;m just not involved.&quot;

== Reception ==

&quot;Stargate&quot; took in $16.7million on its opening weekend and $196.6million overall, and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as Roger Ebert, several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy, Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels. In the intervening time, copyright-holder MGM succeeded the film with the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; has won the Saturn Award for &quot;Best Syndicated Television Series&quot; on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting. More recently, it received acclaim for its visual effects, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget. On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the Nielsen ratings. Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating websites in reaction to exhibit their commitment to the series. Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of &quot;SG-1&quot; are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told the fansite GateWorld exclusively that he was working to continue &quot;SG-1&quot;. Currently, no network or company has ordered new episodes of &quot;SG-1&quot;, so the show is on hold until a new buyer can be found. However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing its original exclusive contract with MGM. &quot;Atlantis&quot; proved to be as successful as &quot;SG-1&quot;, with Nielsen ratings and viewership. The &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise in 2009 won a Constellation Award in the category of Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008.

The average viewership to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; was around ten million a week worldwide. According to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; co-creator Brad Wright, the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in homeland Canada. About thirty million &quot;Stargate&quot; DVDs were sold worldwide by 2006.

The DVD release of &quot;&quot; in the US earned MGM/Fox $1.59million in rentals in the first week after the release, and another $1.38million in rentals in the second week. In its third week it earned US$1.19million in rentals totaling $4.16million. The DVD has also earned $9million in sales. &quot;&quot; would go on to gross over $8million United States dollars in the United States. The film sparked mostly positive reviews with movie critics. A third &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; movie was planned to follow &quot;Continuum&quot;, but the third movie was put on hold with any other future Stargate movies; the film would have centered around the character of Jack O&#x27;Neill.

In 2010 &quot;Stargate&quot; was estimated to have injected $1 billion in to the economy of British Columbia.

== Literature ==

There are three series of novels based on the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, one based on the original &quot;Stargate&quot; film and two based in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; television shows. A series of books written by Bill McCay, published from 1995 to 1999, were unofficial sequels to the film.

From 1999 to 2001, ROC published four novels based in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; written by Ashley McConnell. In 2004, UK-based Fandemonium Press started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Due to the conflict with ROC&#x27;s license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official &quot;Stargate Magazine&quot;, produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

A series of comic books, based on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, began to be published by Avatar Press in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa. In February 2008, it was announced that Big Finish Productions would release officially licensed audiobooks featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are &quot;Gift of the Gods&quot; read by Michael Shanks and &quot;A Necessary Evil&quot; read by Torri Higginson.

== Future ==

=== &quot;Stargate&quot; (1994) continuity ===
After Bill McCay had written a series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the &quot;Stargate&quot; television series, in 2006, Dean Devlin said: &quot;He has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original.&quot; According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first film already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would have then tied all the mythologies together. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that &quot;Devlin can wish to do a sequel to &quot;Stargate&quot; all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they&#x27;ll ask him to do it. He knows better.&quot; These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; if they are ever produced.

On July 4, 2011, Dean Devlin spoke out again saying he had not given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three. His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three:

However, Devlin told &quot;Empire&quot; in November 2016 that the plans to make a reboot of a potential new series were stalled.

=== &quot;SG-1&quot;/&quot;Atlantis&quot;/&quot;Universe&quot; continuity ===
In September 2018, it was reported that &quot;SG-1&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot; showrunner Brad Wright had been approached by MGM about continuing the franchise. The following year, &quot;SG-1&quot; stars Amanda Tapping and Richard Dean Anderson further confirmed that they&#x27;d spoken to Wright and expressed their own interest in returning to the franchise in some capacity. In January 2019, Wright elaborated that his conversations with MGM pertained to continuing the television franchise in a way that fully acknowledged the &quot;several hundred hours of show that&#x27;s already out there&quot; and not simply honouring it. In July 2020, &quot;SG-1&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot; writer-producer Joseph Mallozzi teased Wright&#x27;s project, commenting that &quot;we&#x27;ve never been closer to a fourth &quot;Stargate&quot; series.&quot; This continued in September 2020, when it was reported that whilst not currently involved in writing, Mallozzi had spoken to Wright about the development, confirming it to be a fourth television series which would continue on from where &quot;SG-1&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot; left off and include characters from those shows.

On November 21, 2020, Brad Wright confirmed that he was developing a television series of &quot;Stargate&quot; with MGM and that it would be a continuation, not a reboot. He also confirmed that whilst things were progressing, the industry shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic was slowing aspects of the development. In a series of podcasts in March and May 2021, Wright continued to offer small updates on the project, including that his script features the &quot;SG-1&quot; characters of Daniel Jackson, Cameron Mitchell, Samantha Carter and Jack O&#x27;Neill, with the hope that Michael Shanks, Ben Browder and Amanda Tapping all return in some capacity to their respective roles. Wright also expressed that if the series does go ahead, he would want Tapping to direct, with it being clarified by Tapping that the series was not in active production, but still being worked on by Wright.

In March 2022, Amazon completed a purchase of MGM, its library, and assets, including &quot;Stargate&quot;. Around that time, writer and producer on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Universe&quot; Joseph Mallozzi teased Wright&#x27;s pilot script for the new project on social media. However, in November 2022, Wright announced that his revival project was likely dead following Amazon&#x27;s purchase.

=== New continuity/reboot ===
In December 2022, Amazon Studios and MGM were reported to be taking pitches on a reboot of the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise. The creators of &quot;The Expanse&quot;, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, were on the short list of possible showrunners for the new &quot;Stargate&quot;.

<text>Jerrold Laurence Samuels (May 3, 1938 – March 10, 2023) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and talent agent. Under the pseudonym Napoleon XIV, he achieved one-hit wonder status with the #3 hit novelty song &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot; in 1966. Samuels occasionally revisited the Napoleon XIV character to record other songs, usually comedy records with an insanity theme.

Under the name Scott David (his son&#x27;s name), he cowrote &quot;As If I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot; with Larry Kusik, a top-10 hit for Adam Wade in 1961. Samuels also wrote &quot;The Shelter of Your Arms&quot;, a top-20 hit for Sammy Davis Jr. in 1964.

==Biography==

=== Childhood and early career ===
Jerrold Laurence Samuels was born in Manhattan and was raised in the Bronx. He played the piano and wrote music throughout his childhood, and began his recording career in 1956 when he cut the single &quot;Puppy Love&quot; for the Vik Records subsidiary of RCA Victor Records.

Samuels was an acclaimed songwriter during the early 1960s. Under the name Scott David (his son&#x27;s name), he cowrote &quot;As If I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot; with Larry Kusik, a top-10 hit for Adam Wade in 1961. Samuels also wrote &quot;The Shelter of Your Arms&quot;, a top-20 hit for Sammy Davis Jr. in 1964.

=== Napoleon XIV ===
In 1966, Samuels concocted &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot; while working at Associated Recording Studios in New York. The public found out his true identity when Cousin Brucie of WABC revealed his name. The record quickly climbed the charts, reaching the top ten nationally in just its third week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It peaked at #3 and sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In the Cash Box Top 100 the record even climbed to No. 1 for one week in its second week on the charts.

The success of the single inspired a Warner Bros. album of the same name in 1966 (reissued by Rhino in 1985), most of which continued the mental illness theme, for example: &quot;Bats in My Belfry&quot; and &quot;I Live in a Split Level Head&quot;, the latter of which features different vocal parts in each stereo speaker. A second single of two recordings from that album went relatively unnoticed. His manager was Leonard Stogel.

In the following years, Samuels would occasionally revisit the Napoleon XIV character to record other songs, usually comedy records with an insanity theme.

His songs were often played on Dr. Demento&#x27;s radio show.

=== Later career ===
In his later years, Samuels worked as a singer and agent who booked various performers in the Delaware Valley. In 1984, he founded the Jerry Samuels Agency, and later operated it with his second wife, Bobbie. They retired in 2021.

In February 2022, Needlejuice Records teased the release of &quot;an album that&#x27;s 50 years old&quot;. The following year, they announced it was Samuels&#x27; long-lost second studio album, &quot;For God&#x27;s Sake, Stop the Feces!&quot; Recorded between April 1968 and December 1970, the album was rejected by Warner Bros. for its macabre content; notably, the eighth track, &quot;Rape&quot;, which provides a graphic account of a sexual assault, and the fourteenth, &quot;The Note&quot;, which portrays a man writing a suicide note. &quot;Stop the Feces&quot; was released on April 20, 2023, one month after Samuels&#x27; death.

=== Personal life and death ===
Samuels was married twice: first to Rosemary Djivre, divorcing in 1968, and then to Bobbie Simon from 1996 until his death. He was also in a relationship with Petra Vesters from 1973 to 1987. He had a son from his first marriage and another from his relationship with Vesters. Another son predeceased him. Samuels was a longtime resident of the Oxford Circle neighborhood of Philadelphia, though he moved to an assisted living facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, after retiring.

Samuels died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia at a hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, on March 10, 2023, at the age of 84.

<text>Dorrel Norman Elvert &quot;Whitey&quot; Herzog (; November 9, 1931 – April 15, 2024) was an American professional baseball outfielder and manager, most notable for his Major League Baseball (MLB) managerial career.

Herzog made his major league debut as a player in 1956 with the Washington Senators. After his playing career ended in 1963, Herzog went on to perform a variety of roles in Major League Baseball, including scout, manager, coach, general manager, and farm system director.

As a scout and farm system director, Herzog helped the New York Mets win the 1969 World Series. As a big-league manager, he led the Kansas City Royals to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1976 to 1978. Hired by Gussie Busch in 1980 to helm the St. Louis Cardinals, the team made three World Series appearances, winning the 1982 World Series over the Milwaukee Brewers and falling in 1985 and 1987.

Herzog was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 2010, and was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum on August 16, 2014.

==Early life==
Herzog was born on November 9, 1931, in New Athens, Illinois, to Edgar and Lietta Herzog. His father worked at a brewery and his mother at a shoe factory. Whitey attended New Athens High School where he played basketball and baseball. He drew interest from the college basketball programs at Saint Louis University and Illinois. As a youth, Herzog delivered newspapers, sold baked goods from a truck, dug graves, and worked at the brewery with his father. He was known as &quot;Relly&quot; — a diminutive of Dorrel, his given first name.

His older brother Therron played a year of minor league baseball in 1954 in the Cotton States League.

==Baseball career==
===Playing career===
Herzog both batted and threw left-handed. He was originally signed by the New York Yankees by scout Lou Maguolo. While playing for the McAlester Rockets in the Sooner State League in 1949 and 1950, a sportscaster gave Herzog the nickname &quot;Whitey&quot; due to his light blonde hair and resemblance to blonde Yankees pitcher Bob &quot;The White Rat&quot; Kuzava, (rather than the light blonde Yankee starter and future Hall of Famer Whitey Ford, then on the way to a 9–1 rookie season). In 1953, during the Korean War, Herzog served the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, during which time he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri and managed the camp&#x27;s baseball team.

While he was still a minor league prospect, the Yankees traded Herzog to the Washington Senators on April 2, 1956, to complete a February trade in which the Yankees had sent Lou Berberet, Bob Wiesler, Dick Tettelbach, and Herb Plews to Washington for Mickey McDermott. He made his major league debut with the Senators in 1956 and played for them until May 15, 1958, when he was sold to the Kansas City Athletics. Before the 1961 season, the Athletics traded Herzog and Russ Snyder to the Baltimore Orioles for Wayne Causey, Jim Archer, Bob Boyd, Clint Courtney, and Al Pilarcik. After the 1962 season, the Orioles traded Herzog and Gus Triandos to the Detroit Tigers for Dick Brown. Herzog retired after playing for the Tigers in the 1963 season. In 634 games spread over eight seasons, Herzog batted .257 with 25 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 213 runs scored, 60 doubles, 20 triples, and 13 stolen bases. In reference to his relative success as a player versus being a manager, Herzog said, &quot;Baseball has been good to me since I quit trying to play it.&quot;

===Player development===
After his playing career ended, Herzog rejoined the Athletics for two seasons, as a scout in 1964 and a coach in 1965.

His next seven years were spent with the New York Mets, the first, in 1966, as the third-base coach for manager Wes Westrum. Beginning in 1967 Herzog then made his mark with the club during his six-year tenure as its director of player development. On his watch, the Mets produced young talent that either appeared on one or both of its 1969 and 1973 World Series teams or were dealt and had successful major league careers elsewhere. Among this crop of players was Gary Gentry, Wayne Garrett, Jon Matlack, John Milner, Amos Otis, and Ken Singleton. Herzog was a candidate to become the Mets&#x27; manager after the death of Gil Hodges prior to the 1972 season, but was passed over in favor of first-base coach Yogi Berra, a future Yankee Hall of Fame catcher and brief ex-Met player, by chairman of the board M. Donald Grant. He had been ordered to not attend Hodges&#x27; funeral by Grant&#x27;s associates to avoid speculation.

==Managerial career==
===Rangers and Angels===
Perceiving Grant&#x27;s actions as a snub, Herzog left the Mets to accept the first managerial assignment of his career. On November 2, 1972, he signed a two-year contract to lead the Texas Rangers, the only major league team to have 100 losses in 1972. Hired based on recommendations from general manager Joe Burke to owner Bob Short, he&#x27;d been given the understanding that he was to help develop the team&#x27;s young prospects. He immediately abandoned the platoon system used heavily by his predecessor Ted Williams.

Herzog debuted with a 3–1 Rangers loss to the Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium on April 7, 1973. His first victory was a 4–0 triumph over the Kansas City Royals five nights later on April 12 at Royals Stadium.

He never got the chance to finish the 1973 season. With the team at 47–91, he was fired on September 7, three days after a home field 14–0 defeat at Comiskey Park. Coach Del Wilber replaced him for one game, followed by Billy Martin, who had been fired by the Detroit Tigers on August 30. Short defended the change by telling reporters, &quot;If my mother were managing the Rangers and I had the opportunity to hire Billy Martin, I&#x27;d fire my mother.&quot;

Herzog joined the California Angels as their third-base coach in 1974. He was named the team&#x27;s interim manager on June 27, 1974, the same day that his predecessor Bobby Winkles was fired and also Hall of Fame bound successor Dick Williams was hired. The first game he managed was a 5–0 win for the Angels, who split a four-game weekend series against the Rangers at Anaheim Stadium during his brief 4-game stint.

===Kansas City Royals===
Herzog succeeded Jack McKeon as manager of the Kansas City Royals on July 24, 1975, and managed the team from 1975 to 1979. At the time he took over in 1975, the team was in second place in the American League West but trailed the defending and eventual division champion Oakland Athletics by 11 games. The Royals went on to win three straight American League Western division titles from 1976 to 1978. However, each of those seasons ended with losses to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series, with each one having their own particular brand of sting. In the 1976 American League Championship Series, the two teams traded wins to see an even series by the time of the decisive Game 5 in New York. The Royals trailed by three runs in the eighth before rallying to tie the game. On the first pitch of the bottom of the ninth, Chris Chambliss hit a series-ending walk off home run off closer Mark Littell. In the 1977 series, the teams traded wins again in the first four, but the Royals had a chance to clinch it at home. Game 5 saw them lead 3–1 going into the eighth inning, but the Yankees narrowed it to a run with a pinch-hit RBI. Now going with Dennis Leonard (who had pitched a complete game two days earlier), it all sputtered. He allowed a hit and a walk before being pulled, but the Yankees continued to hit the ball and scored three runs in the inning before Kansas City went down in the bottom half as the Yankees went to the World Series again. In the 1978 series, the Royals won Game 2 and played competitive in Game 3, but Herzog&#x27;s decision to go with Doug Bird in the eighth inning to face Thurman Munson resulted in him belting a go-ahead two-run shot as the Yankees won 6-5. The Royals scored a run in first inning of Game 4 but the Yankees led by the end of the 5th and never looked back in a 2-1 victory.

Herzog and general manager Joe Burke clashed during the 1979 season over personnel moves, and he openly chafed at being offered one-year contracts by owner Ewing Kauffman, who in turn did not like the treatment given to first baseman John Mayberry, whose lackadaisical play in Game 4 of the 1977 series had led to Herzog benching him for Game 5 before blaming him for the series loss and then demanding him to be traded. After the 1979 season saw the team finish second to the California Angels, Herzog was fired, and he actually expressed criticism of Burke for not doing it sooner to try and give the team a spark during the season.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

On June 8, 1980, Herzog was hired by St. Louis Cardinals (under general manager John Claiborne) to manage the team to replace Ken Boyer. Herzog was quoted almost immediately as the leader when asked, stating “I’m going to take this dang team and run it like I think it should be run. I don’t think I’ve ever had trouble with players hustling. I understand that’s been a problem here. I think you’ll see the Cardinals running out groundballs.” He won the 1982 World Series, and both won the National League pennant and appeared in the Series again in 1985 and 1987.

Herzog&#x27;s style of play, based on the strategy of attrition, was nicknamed &quot;Whiteyball&quot; and concentrated on pitching, speed, and defense to win games rather than on home runs. Herzog&#x27;s lineups generally consisted of one or more base-stealing threats at the top of the lineup, with a power threat such as George Brett or Jack Clark hitting third or fourth, protected by one or two productive hitters, followed by more base stealers. This tactic kept payrolls low, while allowing Herzog to win consistently in stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were characteristics of Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium) and Busch Memorial Stadium during his managerial career.

A less noticed (at the time) aspect of Herzog&#x27;s offensive philosophy was his preference for patient hitters with high on-base percentages: such players included Royals Brett, Hal McRae, and Amos Otis, and Cardinals Clark, Keith Hernandez, José Oquendo, and Ozzie Smith, as well as Darrell Porter, who played for Herzog in both Kansas City and St. Louis. However, in St. Louis, Herzog also employed free-swinging hitters who were less patient, but speedy runners and fielders, such as six-time NL stolen base champion Vince Coleman and 1985 NL MVP Willie McGee.

Herzog&#x27;s final season with the Cardinals, and in his managerial career, was the 1990 season; he resigned on July 6 of that year with the team at 33–47 and in last place in the NL East. He jokingly stated, &quot;I came here in last place and I leave here in last place. I left them right where I started.&quot; His overall Cardinals record is 822 wins and 728 losses.

==General managing career==
With his extensive background in player development, Herzog also was a major league general manager with both the Cardinals (1980–82) and the California Angels (1993–94).

Herzog succeeded interim manager Jack Krol as manager of the Cardinals on June 9, 1980, managed for 73 games, then moved into the club&#x27;s front office as general manager on August 26, turning the team over to Red Schoendienst. During the off-season, Herzog reclaimed the manager job, then held both the general and field manager posts with St. Louis for almost two full seasons, during which he acquired or promoted many players who would star on the Cardinals&#x27; three World Series teams of the 1980s. In a 1983 poll of major league players by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Herzog was voted best manager in baseball.

Herzog served as general manager of the California Angels from 1993 to 1994. During his tenure, the Angels went 118–159, missing the 1993 postseason (with the 1994 playoffs cancelled due to a players&#x27; strike).

Herzog&#x27;s tenure was overshadowed by a feud with owner Jackie Autry over the team&#x27;s budget constraints, a power struggle with team Vice-President Dave O&#x27;Brien, and the loss of key free agents like Dave Winfield and Wally Joyner.

==Later years==
Herzog expressed an interest in becoming President of the National League when that job opened in 1986. The role eventually went to Yale University President A. Bartlett Giamatti, who also became the Commissioner of baseball in 1989. In a nationally televised interview on NBC, after Giamatti accepted the job of NL President, Marv Albert jokingly asked Herzog if he would be interested in the job opening for president of Yale University. Herzog replied, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re trying to be funny now, Marv. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s funny at all.&quot;

Both Herzog and Jim Leyland were candidates to become manager of the Boston Red Sox following the 1996 season. Both rejected offers from the Red Sox, so the team hired Jimy Williams instead.

==Managerial record and legacy==

Herzog was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans&#x27; Committee on December 7, 2009, receiving 14 of a possible 16 votes. The Cardinals retired the jersey number 24, which he wore during his managerial tenure with the club, following his induction. Rick Ankiel was the last Cardinal to wear number 24.

In total, Herzog led six division winners, three pennant winners, and one World Series winner in compiling a 1,281–1,125 (.532) career record.

==Personal life==
Herzog married his high school sweetheart, Mary Lou (), in 1953. They had three children.

Herzog resided in St. Louis, Missouri. His younger brother, Codell (&quot;Butz&quot;) died on February 20, 2010, at 76. He made out Whitey&#x27;s first lineup with the Cardinals in 1980. His grandson John Urick was a minor league first baseman and outfielder from 2003 until 2010 who played for managers and former Herzog-era Cardinals Garry Templeton and Hal Lanier.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Herzog among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

Herzog died in St. Louis on April 15, 2024, at the age of 92. Upon his death, Commissioner Rob Manfred released a statement:

<text>Lakemba () is a suburb in Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Lakemba is located 12 kilometres south west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown.

==Geography==
Lakemba is in the Cooks River watershed. This river is tidal up to the edge of Lakemba. A bike and walking trail takes walkers and cyclists all the way from nearby Belfield to the east along the Cooks River, to where it flows into Botany Bay. In the opposite direction the bike and walking trail goes north to Olympic Park and Homebush Bay on the Parramatta River.

Canterbury Road winds its way high along the ridge, which is the boundary of the watersheds of Cooks River and Wolli Creek to the south. It is near the shopping centre on Haldon Street.

==History==
The area was at an early time in its colonial history originally known as Potato Hill because potatoes were cropped there. Land grants by the new colonial government began in Lakemba about 1810. Samuel Hockley was granted , which he called Essex Hill Farm, after his home county in England. The suburb was known as Belmore South until 1910.

Benjamin Taylor had a 22 hectare property in the 1880s. He named his property &quot;Lakeba&quot; (pronounced Lakemba) after the Lakeba island in the Lau Islands group of Fiji, where his second wife&#x27;s grandparents, Rev and Mrs Cross, were missionaries from 1835. One of the original streets is Oneata Street, named after another small Fijian Island, close to Lakeba. Benjamin Taylor was variously an entomologist, town clerk, Alderman and Mayor of Canterbury Council. The railway line was built to the neighbouring suburb of Belmore in 1895 and extended to Lakemba and beyond, in 1909. The station was built on Benjamin Taylor&#x27;s property and was named after his &#x27;Lakemba Cottage&#x27;.

The first school opened here as Belmore School in April 1869 and became known as Belmore South in September 1907 until it was changed to Lakemba Public School in July 1969. The post office opened on 1 July 1920.

After World War II, Lakemba, like other western suburbs, became home to many of these new arrivals. Immigrants from Greece, Italy, and later, from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, began to settle in the area. From the 1950s, Lakemba&#x27;s population became increasingly multicultural, with many different ethnic enclaves in the area. The diversity transformed Lakemba into a vibrant, multi-ethnically diverse suburb, in which its trend continues in the present day.

In the 21st century, Lakemba diversified its population, especially with newer waves of immigrants in conflict zones from Iraq and Syria.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census, there were 17,092 people in Lakemba.

Lakemba has had a diverse demographic history. Like most of the rest of Australia, its first non-Aboriginal inhabitants in the nineteenth century were British and Irish settlers. By the mid-twentieth century, the suburb had absorbed large numbers of Greek and Italian arrivals. Local businesses and clubs reflected this in Mediterranean delicatessens, take-away shops and the Greek Orthodox Club.

From the mid-1970s, Lakemba became very popular with migrants from Lebanon and by the mid-1990s the area was considered a centre of Lebanese Australian life. The founding of the Lakemba Mosque and the establishment of specialised restaurants, take-away shops, grocery shops, clothing and book sellers catering to Arab and Muslim cultural needs has encouraged a general perception of Lakemba as a &quot;predominantly&quot; Arab and Muslim suburb. However, as of the 2021 census, the ethnic make-up of Lakemba is much more diverse, with only 6.4% of residents identifying as Lebanese by ancestry. The largest group by reported ancestry is instead Bangladeshi.

In 2021, 32.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Bangladesh (15.0%), India (8.8%), Pakistan (5.3%), Myanmar (4.3%) and Lebanon (3.4%). The most common reported ancestries were Bangladeshi (14.3%), Indian (10.7%), Australian (8.3%), English (6.8%) and Lebanese (6.4%).

16.6% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Bengali (18.5%), Urdu (13.2%), Arabic (10.5%), Vietnamese (3.8%) and Rohingya (3.2%).

In the 2021 census, the most common responses for religion were Islam (61.2%), Not stated (10.1%), Catholic (8.8%), No religion (6.7%) and Eastern Orthodox (3.4%).

==Transport==

Lakemba railway station is located on the Bankstown railway line. The line was extended to Lakemba in 1909 and electrified in 1926. The station was temporarily closed on 30 September 2024 to allow for the line to be converted to Sydney Metro standards as part of the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest project. These works are to be completed by 2025, after which Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line services will run every 4 minutes during peak hour, with travel times between Lakemba and decreased from 28 minutes to 22.

For details of bus services see Lakemba station.

==Residential area==
Lakemba is mentioned heavily in news reports in regards to its affordability compared to the Sydney market being as close to the city as it is. The area was the best performing suburb over the last 10 years from 2020 with further growth expected with the construction of the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest which will reduce city travel times and bring new residential and commercial development to the area. Additionally Lakemba receives media coverage as one of the last areas of Sydney where it is cheaper to buy than rent.

==Commercial area==
Lakemba has many shops, on and around Haldon Street, where a wide range of international and local foods can be purchased. There are also commercial developments along Canterbury Road. The Lakemba Palms shopping centre, is located on the corner of Haldon Street and Lakemba street. On 3 December 2007, a fire gutted the Lakemba Palms shopping centre and faced demolition.

==Lakemba Ramadan Markets==
Lakemba Ramadan Markets at Haldon St is a nightly food market in the month of Ramadan. According to visitors, the Camel burger is the best dish from the Ramadan night market in Lakemba. One month a year, people across Australia visit Lakemba for the Ramadan Market Nights. The popularity of the Ramadan markets and its offerings throughout the year eventually attract thousands of people every week.

==Places of worship==

Lakemba has many places of worship to cater for the different religions of its population, including St Therese Catholic Church, Lakemba Uniting Church, Lakemba Presbyterian Church and several Mosques including the Darul Ulum Sydney, Lakemba Mosque, Ernest Street Masjid, Lakemba Musalla, and Ahl Al Sunna Wal Jamaah Association Musallah.

The St. Andrews Anglican Church, located at the corner of Quigg and Lakemba Street, was built in 1923 as a brick building with a significant collection of stained glass windows. The original church was a wooden building, later extended to become the parish hall.

==Schools==
Lakemba contains multiple private and public schools including:

* Lakemba Public School
* Hampden Park Public School
* Canterbury Vale School
* St Therese Primary School
* Holy Spirit College
* Rissalah College
* AlHikma College

==Politics==
Lakemba is the name of one of the parliamentary constituencies of New South Wales. The Electoral district of Lakemba is currently occupied by Jihad Dib, from the Australian Labor Party. The Federal Member of Parliament is Tony Burke.

==Lakemba Fire Station==

The fire station was built in 1921 by the Board of Fire Commissioners of New South Wales. It was originally staffed by a combination of permanent and volunteer members. The station was built for a total cost of $13,950.00. It is located at 208 Haldon Street.

<doc id="762859" wikidata="Q2569728" url="?curid=762859" title="Dalal Mughrabi">
<text>Dalal Mughrabi (, ; &quot;c.&quot; 1959 – 11 March 1978) was a Palestinian militant who was a member of the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and participated in the 1978 Coastal Road massacre in Israel. The attack resulted in the death of 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children. Mughrabi and eight other militants were also killed in the course of the operation. While she has been hailed as a martyr and a national hero among many Palestinians, Israel and the United Nations have described her as a terrorist.

==Early life==
Mughrabi was born and raised in the Palestinian refugee camp of Sabra in Beirut, Lebanon. Her father was a Palestinian refugee whose family home prior to the 1948 Palestine war was in Jaffa, Palestine. Her mother was Lebanese.

Originally educated as a nurse, Mughrabi decided to devote her life to politics when the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975. She joined Fatah and began working within the organization&#x27;s communications service. She took part in the fighting against the Syrian army in the mountains southeast of Beirut when Syrian forces entered Lebanon in 1976 to assist the Phalangists and their allies. In 1977 she completed a three-month training course attaining her the rank of lieutenant. She was offered a post in Italy by Fatah as political officer working at the PLO office, but she declined choosing instead a military career.

==1978 operation==

Mughrabi was part of a group of eleven Palestinian and Lebanese militants who landed on March 11, 1978, on the coastal plain near Tel Aviv. Mughrabi allegedly led the group, though reports differ. The timing was aimed at scuttling peace talks between Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat, and the intent was to attack the ministry of defence in Tel Aviv or to &quot;reach the Knesset and demand the release of Palestinian prisoners&quot; or to &quot;kill as many Israelis as possible&quot;.

===Murder of Gail Rubin===
Landing at the beach, Mughrabi&#x27;s group met American photographer Gail Rubin, who was taking nature photographs on the beach, and asked her where they were, after which they killed her. Both surviving members of the group later confirmed that it was Mughrabi who killed Rubin, who was the niece of US Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff.

===Hijacking===
The militants opened fire at passing traffic and hijacked a taxi, killing its occupants. They seized a bus and headed to Tel Aviv, and then hijacked another bus, moving the hostages (now numbering 71) to the first bus.

Israeli forces stopped the bus, and a shooting battle ensued before it exploded. During the shootout Mughrabi allegedly raised the Palestinian flag and declared the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the bus exploded after Mughrabi blew it up with a grenade, while Palestinians say it was struck by fire from an Israeli helicopter gunship. A total of 38 Israelis, including 13 children, were killed and 72 were wounded; Mughrabi and eight other militants died as well.

==Release of remains==
As part of the 2008 Israel–Hezbollah prisoner exchange, Mughrabi&#x27;s remains were supposed to be exhumed and returned to Lebanon. She was buried in a &quot;cemetery for enemy dead&quot; but the Israel Defense Forces apparently could not locate the body due to underground currents moving the coffins in the cemetery. Mughrabi&#x27;s sister told Ma&#x27;an News Agency that the family received a coffin that contained &quot;just dirt and stones&quot;.

==Commemoration as a martyr==
Among many Palestinians, Mughrabi is viewed as a martyr in the struggle for the liberation of Palestine. Among Israelis, she is viewed as a terrorist responsible for one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the history of the State of Israel.

Numerous Palestinian sites and institutions, some inaugurated by the Palestinian Authority, bear her name, including a public square, schools, a computer center, a soccer tournament, and a summer camp.

The dedication of the public square in the city of al-Bireh was controversial. It was initially scheduled for March 2010 on the 32nd anniversary of the Coastal Road attack, and would also have coincided with a visit to the region by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.

Public condemnation came from Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister, who said the honoring of Mughrabi was anti-Israel incitement that &quot;encourages terrorism&quot;, and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said such actions were &quot;provocations... needlessly inflaming tensions and imperiling prospects for a comprehensive peace.&quot; Dozens of Palestinian teenagers from Fatah&#x27;s youth division and a senior Fatah official gathered at the square.

In March 2011, an official ceremony was held, installing a plaque that depicted Mughrabi cradling a rifle against a map of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

In addition, the PA launched a seminar called &quot;Martyr Dalal Mughrabi Camp,&quot; to be held in Jericho.
In May 2017, the Palestinian Authority via its organisation Women&#x27;s Affairs Technical Committee (WATC) named a women&#x27;s center in the town of Burqa after Mughrabi and celebrated her as a role model.

The center was built with the aid of the government of Norway and UN Women. Norway&#x27;s Foreign Minister demanded that Norway&#x27;s funding for the building be repaid and its logo removed from the building. He said that &quot;Norway will not allow itself to be associated with institutions that take the names of terrorists in this way&quot;.

The United Nations also condemned the naming as &quot;glorification of terrorism&quot; and demanded its logo be removed from the building.

The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs started its own investigations of WATC and found it had withheld central information about the naming of the centre and terminated the working relationship with WATC. As a result of the findings, Denmark ceased funding 23 other NGOs in Palestine.

<doc id="762860" wikidata="Q1130522" url="?curid=762860" title="Operation Mincemeat">
<text>Operation Mincemeat was a successful British deception operation of the Second World War to disguise the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. Two members of British intelligence obtained the body of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison, dressed him as an officer of the Royal Marines and placed personal items on him identifying him as the fictitious Captain (Acting Major) William Martin. Correspondence between two British generals that suggested that the Allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, with Sicily as merely the target of a feint, was also placed on the body.

Part of the wider Operation Barclay, Mincemeat was based on the 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division, and his personal assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the American military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began by transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine and releasing it close to shore, where it was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read and Ultra decrypts of German messages showed that the Germans fell for the ruse. German reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.

The full effect of Operation Mincemeat is not known, but Sicily was liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in &quot;Operation Heartbreak&quot;, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the intelligence officers who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu&#x27;s book formed the basis for the 1956 British film &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;. A second British film was released in 2021, titled &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot;.

==Background==

===Inspiration for Mincemeat===

On 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the Second World War, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, circulated the Trout memo, a paper that compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The journalist and author Ben Macintyre observes that although the paper was published under Godfrey&#x27;s name, it &quot;bore all the hallmarks of ... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming&quot;, Godfrey&#x27;s personal assistant. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was titled: &quot;A Suggestion (not a very nice one)&quot;; it was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.

The deliberate planting of fake documents to be found by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British and others in the First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map, and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.

In September 1942 an aircraft flying from Britain to Gibraltar crashed off Cádiz. All aboard were killed, including Paymaster-Lieutenant James Hadden Turner – a courier carrying top secret documents – and a French agent. Turner&#x27;s documents included a letter from General Mark Clark, the American Deputy Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, to General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, British Governor and Commander in Chief of Gibraltar, informing him that General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander, would arrive in Gibraltar on the eve of Operation Torch&#x27;s &quot;target date&quot; of 4November. Turner&#x27;s body washed up on the beach near Tarifa and was recovered by the Spanish authorities. When the body was returned to the British, the letter was still on it, and technicians determined that the letter had not been opened. Other Allied intelligence sources established that the notebook carried by the French agent had been copied by the Germans, but they dismissed it as being disinformation. To British planners, it showed that some material that was obtained by the Spanish was being passed to the Germans.

===British Intelligence and the inspiration for the plan===

A month after the Turner crash, the British intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley outlined his own variation of the Trout memo plan, codenamed Trojan Horse, after the Achaean deception from the Trojan War. His plan was:

Cholmondeley was a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who had been seconded to MI5, Britain&#x27;s domestic counter-intelligence and security service. He had been appointed as the secretary of the Twenty Committee, a small inter-service, inter-departmental intelligence team in charge of double agents. In November 1942 the Twenty Committee turned down Cholmondeley&#x27;s plan as being unworkable, but thought there may have been some potential in the idea. As there was a naval connection to the plan, John Masterman, the chairman of the committee, assigned Ewen Montagu, the naval representative, to work with Cholmondeley to develop the plan further. Montagu – a peacetime lawyer and King&#x27;s Counsel who had volunteered at the outbreak of the war – worked under Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Division, where he ran NID 17(M), the sub-branch which handled counter-espionage work. Godfrey had also appointed Montagu to oversee all naval deception involving double agents. As part of his duties, Montagu had been briefed on the need for deception operations to aid the Allied war aims in a forthcoming invasion operation in the Mediterranean.

===Military situation===

In late 1942, with the Allied success in the North African campaign, military planners turned their attention to the next target. British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944 and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, wanted to use the Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe&#x27;s &quot;soft underbelly&quot;. There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack. The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy. The second option was to go into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces between the British and American invaders and the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed Operation Husky – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July. There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said &quot;Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it&#x27;s Sicily&quot; – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected.

Adolf Hitler was concerned about a Balkan invasion, as the area had been the source of raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler&#x27;s fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, diverting resources from Sicily. The deception reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. False communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using landlines wherever possible.

==Development==
===Examining the practicalities; locating a corpse===

Montagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan. Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist. Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water. He added that &quot;Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance&quot;. Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy. Montagu later wrote

This meant that not only would they have a better degree of success than they previously thought, but that there would be a larger number of corpses potentially available for selection when the time came. When Montagu discussed the possibility of obtaining a corpse with Bentley Purchase, the coroner for the Northern District of London, he was told there would be practical and legal difficulties: &quot;I should think bodies are the only commodities not in short supply at the moment [but] even with bodies all over the place, each one has to be accounted for&quot;. Purchase promised to look out for a body that was suitable, with no relatives who would claim the corpse for burial.

On 28 January 1943 Purchase contacted Montagu with the news he had located a suitable body, probably that of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison that contained phosphorus. Purchase informed Montagu and Cholmondeley that the small amount of poison in the system would not be identified in a body that was supposed to have been floating in the sea for several days. When Montagu commented that the under-nourished corpse did not look like a fit field officer, Purchase informed him that &quot;he does not have to look like an officer – only a staff officer&quot;, more used to office work. Purchase agreed to keep the body in the mortuary refrigerator at a temperature of – any colder and the flesh would freeze, which would be obvious after the body defrosted. He warned Montagu and Cholmondeley that the body had to be used within three months, after which it would have decomposed past the point of usefulness.

====Identity of the corpse====
Montagu refused to identify the individual and only described him as &quot;a bit of a ne&#x27;er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did he did after his death&quot;. In 1996 Roger Morgan, an amateur historian from London, uncovered evidence in the Public Record Office that the identity of the corpse was Michael. An alternative theory to the corpse&#x27;s identity was suggested in the history book &quot;The Secrets of HMS Dasher&quot; (2004) that in March 1943 there was an explosion on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion and observes that the official records of the operation state that Glyndwr Michael was the body.

===Developing the plan; the corpse&#x27;s new identity===
Montagu selected the code name Mincemeat from a list of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley&#x27;s Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to co-operate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.

Montagu and Cholmondeley began to create a &quot;legend&quot; – a fictitious background and character – for the body. The name and rank chosen was Captain (Acting Major) William Martin, of the Royal Marines assigned to Combined Operations Headquarters. The name &quot;Martin&quot; was selected because there were several men with that name of about that rank in the Royal Marines. As a Royal Marine, Major Martin came under Admiralty authority, and it would be easy to ensure that all official inquiries and messages about his death would be routed to the Naval Intelligence Division. Additionally, Royal Marines would wear battledress, which was easily obtainable and came in standard sizes. The rank of acting major made him senior enough to be entrusted with sensitive documents, but not so prominent that anyone would expect to know him.
To reinforce the impression of Martin being a real person, Montagu and Cholmondeley provided corroborative details to be carried on his person – known in espionage circles as wallet or pocket litter. These included a photograph of an invented fiancée named Pam; the image was of an MI5 clerk, Jean Leslie. Two love letters from Pam were included in the pocket litter, as was a receipt for a diamond engagement ring costing £53 10s 6d from a Bond Street jewellery shop. Additional personal correspondence was included, consisting of a letter from the fictitious Martin&#x27;s father – described by Macintyre as &quot;pompous and pedantic as only an Edwardian father could be&quot; – which included a note from the family solicitor, and a message from Lloyds Bank, demanding payment of an overdraft of £79 19s 2d. To ensure that the letters would remain legible after immersion in seawater, Montagu asked MI5 scientists to conduct tests on different inks to see which would last longest in the water, and they provided him with a suitable list of popular and available ink brands.

Other items of pocket litter placed on Martin included a book of stamps, a silver cross and a St. Christopher&#x27;s medallion, cigarettes, matches, a pencil stub, keys and a receipt from Gieves for a new shirt. To provide a date that Martin had been in London, ticket stubs from a London theatre and a bill for four nights&#x27; lodging at the Naval and Military Club were added. Along with the other items placed on him, an itinerary of his activity in London could be constructed from 18 to 24 April.
Attempts were made to photograph the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and it was obvious that the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing a Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed to look not too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.

===Deception documents===
Montagu outlined three criteria for the document that contained the details of the falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.

The main document was a personal letter from Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Nye, the vice chief of the Imperial General Staff – who had a deep knowledge of ongoing military operations – to General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the Anglo-American 18th Army Group in Algeria and Tunisia under General Eisenhower. After several attempts at drafting the document did not generate something that was considered natural, it was suggested that Nye should draw up the letter himself to cover the required points. The letter covered several purportedly sensitive subjects, such as the (unwanted) award of Purple Heart medals by US forces to British servicemen serving with them and the appointment of a new commander of the Brigade of Guards. Montagu thought the result was &quot;quite brilliant&quot;; the key part of the letter stated that

The letter went on to identify Sicily and the Dodecanese as &quot;cover targets&quot; for the assaults, along with justifications for their selection.
There was also a letter of introduction for Martin from his putative commanding officer, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the chief of Combined Operations, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, the commander-in-chief Mediterranean Fleet and Allied naval commander in the Mediterranean. Martin was referred to in the letter as an amphibious warfare expert on loan until &quot;the assault is over&quot;. The document included a clumsy joke about sardines, which Montagu inserted in the hope that the Germans would see it as a reference to a planned invasion of Sardinia. A single black eyelash was placed within the letter to check if the Germans or Spanish had opened it.

Montagu considered that there would be a possible &quot;Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses&quot;, which could miss the documents stored in the corpse&#x27;s pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten&#x27;s staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet&#x27;s US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle clutched in the corpse&#x27;s hand, held in place by &quot;rigor mortis&quot;, but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.

===Technical considerations; strategic approval===

Montagu and Cholmondeley gave consideration to the location of the corpse&#x27;s delivery. It had long been assumed by the pair that the western coast of Spain would be the ideal location. Early in the planning they investigated the possibility of Portuguese and French coasts, but rejected those in favour of Huelva on the coast of southern Spain, after advice was taken from the Hydrographer of the Navy regarding the tides and currents best suited to ensure the body landed where it was wanted. Montagu later outlined that the choice of Huelva was also made because &quot;there was a very active German agent ... who had excellent contacts with certain Spaniards, both officials and others&quot;. The agent – Adolf Clauss, a member of the – was the son of the German consul, and operated under the cover of an agriculture technician; he was an efficient and effective operative. Huelva was also chosen because the British vice-consul in the city, Francis Haselden, was &quot;a reliable and helpful man&quot; who could be relied upon, according to Montagu.
The body was supposed to be the victim of an aeroplane crash, and it was decided that trying to simulate the accident at sea using flares and other devices could be too risky and open to discovery. After seaplanes and surface ships were dismissed as being problematic, a submarine was chosen as the method of delivering the corpse to the region. To transport the body by submarine, it needed to be contained within the body of the boat, as any externally mounted container would have to be built with a skin so thick it would alter the level of the waterline. The canister needed to remain airtight and keep the corpse as fresh as possible through its journey. Spilsbury provided the medical requirements and Cholmondeley contacted Charles Fraser-Smith of the Ministry of Supply to produce the container, which was labelled &quot;Handle with care: optical instruments&quot;.

On 13 April 1943 the committee of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – that he needed to obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that &quot;in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim&quot;. Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower&#x27;s headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.

==Execution==

In the early hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, although there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen. Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric heater was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly. The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached. The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with of dry ice and sealed up. When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration. The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver, St John &quot;Jock&quot; Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war. Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in the back of the van, which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine , which was preparing for a deployment to the Mediterranean. &quot;Seraph&quot;″s commander, Lt. Bill Jewell, and crew had previous special operations experience. Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret meteorological device to be deployed near Spain.

On 19 April &quot;Seraph&quot; set sail and arrived just off the coast of Huelva on 29 April after having been bombed twice en route. After spending the day reconnoitring the coastline, at 4:15 am on 30 April, &quot;Seraph&quot; surfaced. Jewell had the canister brought up on deck, then sent all his crew below except the officers. They opened the container and lowered the body into the water. Jewell read Psalm 39 and ordered the engines to full astern; the wash from the screws pushed the corpse toward the shore. The canister was reloaded and the submarine travelled out where it surfaced and the empty container was pushed into the water. As it floated, it was riddled with machine gun fire so that it would sink. Because of the air trapped in the insulation, this effort failed, and the canister was destroyed with plastic explosives. Jewell afterwards sent a message to the Admiralty to say &quot;Mincemeat completed&quot;, and continued on to Gibraltar.

==Spanish handling of the corpse and the ramifications==
The body of &quot;Major Martin&quot; was found at around 9:30 am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge. Haselden, as vice-consul, was officially informed by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found. A series of pre-scripted diplomatic cables were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days. The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were encrypted, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played out the story that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important.

At midday on 1May an autopsy was undertaken on Michael&#x27;s body; Haselden was present and – in order to minimise the possibilities that the two Spanish doctors would discover that the body was a three-month-old corpse – asked if, in the heat of the day and smell of the corpse, the doctors should bring the post mortem to a close and have lunch. They agreed and signed a death certificate for Major William Martin for &quot;asphyxiation through immersion in the sea&quot;; the body was released by the Spanish and, as Major Martin, was buried in the San Marco section of Nuestra Señora cemetery in Huelva, with full military honours on 2May.
The Spanish navy retained the briefcase and, despite pressure from Adolf Clauss and some of his agents, neither it nor its contents were handed over to the Germans. On 5May the briefcase was passed to the naval headquarters at San Fernando near Cadiz, for forwarding to Madrid. While at San Fernando the contents were photographed by German sympathisers, but the letters were not opened. Once the briefcase arrived in Madrid, its contents became the focus of attention of Karl-Erich Kühlenthal, one of the most senior agents in Spain. He asked Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the , to personally intervene and persuade the Spanish to surrender the documents. Acceding to the request, the Spanish removed the still-damp paper by tightly winding it around a probe into a cylindrical shape, and then pulling it out between the envelope flap – which was still closed by a wax seal – and the envelope body. The letters were dried and photographed, then soaked in salt water for 24 hours before being re-inserted into their envelopes, without the eyelash that had been planted there. The information was passed to the Germans on 8May. This was deemed so important by the agents in Spain that Kühlenthal personally took the documents to Germany.

On 11May the briefcase, complete with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt, the documents were forensically examined, and the absence of the eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet by the time they returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.

Final proof that the Germans had been passed the information from the letters came on 14May when a German communication was decrypted by the Ultra source of signals intelligence produced by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park. The message, which had been sent two days previously, warned that the invasion was to be in the Balkans, with a feint to the Dodecanese. A message was sent by Brigadier Leslie Hollis – the secretary to the Chiefs of Staff Committee – to Churchill, then in the United States. It read &quot;Mincemeat swallowed rod, line and sinker by the right people and from the best information they look like acting on it.&quot;

Montagu continued the deception to reinforce the existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.

==German reaction==
On 14 May 1943 Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz met Hitler to discuss Dönitz&#x27;s recent visit to Italy, his meeting with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini and the progress of the war. The Admiral, referring to the Mincemeat documents as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon order&quot;, recorded

Hitler informed Mussolini that Greece, Sardinia and Corsica must be defended &quot;at all costs&quot;, and that German troops would be best placed to do the job. He ordered that the experienced 1st Panzer Division be transferred from France to Salonika, Greece. The order was intercepted by GC&amp;CS on 21 May. By the end of June, German troop strength on Sardinia had been doubled to 10,000, with fighter aircraft also based there as support. German torpedo boats were moved from Sicily to the Greek islands in preparation. Seven German divisions transferred to Greece, raising the number present to eight, and ten were posted to the Balkans, raising the number present to eighteen.

On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals intercepted by GC&amp;CS showed that even four hours after the invasion of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that an attack on the Balkans was imminent, and in late July he sent General Erwin Rommel to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, it was too late to make a difference.

==Aftermath==

On 25 July 1943, as the battle for Sicily went against the Axis forces, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted to limit the power of Mussolini, and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King Victor Emmanuel III. The following day Mussolini met the King, who dismissed him as prime minister; the former dictator was then imprisoned. A new Italian government took power and began secret negotiations with the Allies. Sicily fell on 17August after a force of 65,000 Germans held off 400,000 American and British troops long enough to allow many of the Germans to evacuate to the Italian mainland.

The military historian Jon Latimer observes that the relative ease with which the Allies captured Sicily was not entirely because of Mincemeat, or the wider deception of Operation Barclay. Latimer identifies other factors, including Hitler&#x27;s distrust of the Italians, and his unwillingness to risk German troops alongside Italian troops who may have been on the point of a general surrender. The military historian Michael Howard, while describing Mincemeat as &quot;perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war&quot;, considered Mincemeat and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler&#x27;s &quot;congenital obsession with the Balkans&quot;. Macintyre writes that the exact impact of Mincemeat is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded in the first week of fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12. The predicted 90-day campaign was over in 38.

Smyth writes that as a result of Husky, Hitler suspended the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.

==Legacy==

Montagu was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948. Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel &quot;Operation Heartbreak&quot; (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure &quot;the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception ... with Mincemeat being presented as a &#x27;wild&#x27; one-off caper&quot;. In 1977 Montagu published &quot;Beyond Top Secret U&quot;, his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations. In 2010 the journalist Ben Macintyre published &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot;, a history of the events.

A 1956 episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, titled &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, was set during the Second World War, and referred to a microfilm washed up on a beach inside a German boot. The play &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot;, written by Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh, was first staged by the Cardboard Citizens theatre company in 2001. The work focused on Michael&#x27;s homelessness. In his book &quot;The Double Agents&quot;, the writer W. E. B. Griffin depicts Operation Mincemeat as an American operation run by the Office of Strategic Services. Fictional characters are blended with Ian Fleming and the actors David Niven and Peter Ustinov. 

The story was the basis for the 2014 musical &quot;Dead in the Water&quot;, performed at the Camden, Brighton and Guildford Fringe Festivals in 2014. In 2015 the Welsh theatre company Theatr na nÓg produced (&quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;), a musical based on the operation and Glyndwr Michael&#x27;s upbringing in Aberbargoed. The musical was performed by primary school children from Caerphilly County Borough during that year&#x27;s Eisteddfod yr Urdd. Another musical, &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot;, is based on the operation; it was initially staged in 2019 at the New Diorama Theatre, London, then moved to the Fortune Theatre in 2023. In 2014 a BBC television miniseries, &quot;&quot;, dramatised some aspects of Operation Mincemeat, and Fleming&#x27;s connection to the operation. In 2022 the film &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot; was released, with Colin Firth as Montagu and Matthew Macfadyen as Cholmondeley.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission took responsibility for Major Martin&#x27;s grave in Huelva in 1977. In 1997 the Commission added the postscript &quot;Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin RM&quot;. In November 2021 the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, working with the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women and the London Borough of Hackney, placed a memorial at the Hackney Mortuary.

<text>Parkdale—High Park is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1979. It was created during the 1976 electoral boundaries redistribution from parts of Parkdale, High Park—Humber Valley, Davenport and Spadina districts. As of the October 19, 2015, Canadian general election, the current Member of Parliament (MP) is Liberal member Arif Virani.
According to the 2016 census, Parkdale—High Park has the lowest percentage of visible minorities (26.2%) among all City of Toronto ridings; it also has the highest percentage of people of Irish (20.0%), German (9.8%), and French (8.9%) ethnic origin of all City of Toronto ridings.

After the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution process, the 2023 representation orders renamed the electoral district Taiaiako&#x27;n—Parkdale—High Park. They will come into effect upon the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election.

==Geography==
It is located in the central-west part of Toronto on the lakefront. It has 106,559 residents. It is composed of the seven neighbourhoods surrounding High Park. Including the park and portions west, between the north and south borders of the park is the neighbourhood of Swansea; north of the park are the neighbourhoods of High Park North and the south half of The Junction; north-west of the park are the neighbourhoods of Runnymede-Bloor West Village and Lambton Baby Point; to the east of the park is Roncesvalles; and Parkdale directly to the south and to the south-east.

It consists of the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by Lake Ontario, on the west by the Humber River, and on the north and east by a line drawn from the Humber River east along the Canadian Pacific Railway, southeast along the Canadian National/Canadian Pacific Railway, west along Queen Street West, south along Dufferin Street, west along Dufferin Street, and south along the southerly production of Spencer Avenue.

==History==
Prior to the 2023 representation orders from the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution process, the electoral district was named Parkdale—High Park. The electoral district was created in 1976 from parts of Parkdale, High Park—Humber Valley, Davenport and Spadina electoral districts.

In 1976, it was defined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by the shore of Lake Ontario,
on the north and west by the city limits, on the east by a line drawn from north to south along Runnymede Road, east along Annette Street, south along Keele Street, east along Humberside Avenue, southeast along the Canadian National Railway, south along Bathurst Street; thence southerly along Bathurst Street to the Western Channel of Toronto Harbour.

In 1987, it was defined to consist of the parts of the cities of Toronto and York bounded on the west by the city limits of Toronto and York, and on the north, east and south by a line drawn east along the Canadian Pacific Railway line, south along Runnymede Road, east along Annette Street, southeast along Dundas Street West, east along Dupont Street, southwest along the Canadian National Railway line immediately east of Dundas Street West, south along Atlantic Avenue, west along the Gardiner Expressway, south along the southerly production of Spencer Avenue.

In 1996, it was defined to consist of the parts of the cities of Toronto and York bounded on the west by the city limits of Toronto and York, and on the north, east and south by a line drawn east along the Canadian Pacific Railway, southeast along the Canadian National Railway, south along Atlantic Avenue, west along the Gardiner Expressway, and south along the southerly production of Spencer Avenue.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above. This riding was unchanged after the 2012 electoral redistribution. However, the 2023 representation orders did change the name by adding &quot;Taiaiako&#x27;n&quot; to the beginning of the name, and the boundaries had significant changes in the north, including much of traditional area of the old City of West Toronto that was part of the old High Park electoral district pre-1976.

<doc id="762869" wikidata="Q2471500" url="?curid=762869" title="Rous Cup">
<text>The Rous Cup was a short-lived football competition in the second half of the 1980s, contested between England, Scotland and, in later years, a guest team from South America. It was named after Sir Stanley Rous, an English football administrator.

==Overview==

The Rous Cup arose from the ashes of the British Home Championship, which had been discontinued in 1984. Initially, the competition (which was named after Sir Stanley Rous, a former secretary of The Football Association and president of FIFA) was merely a replacement for the annual England v Scotland match that had been lost due to the end of the British Home Championship. Thus, the competition consisted of just one game between England and Scotland (with home advantage alternating annually) with the winner claiming the Cup (a format identical to the Calcutta Cup in rugby union).

After two years under this format, it was decided to invite a different South American team to compete each year to create more excitement and to fulfil England and Scotland&#x27;s desire to regularly play stronger teams, which had been one of their reasons for leaving the British Home Championship in the first place. As there were now three teams competing, a league system, just like the one used in the British Home Championship, was introduced. Each team would play the other two once, receiving two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss, with goal difference being used to differentiate between teams level on points. England and Scotland continued to play each other home and away in alternating years, but the guest South American team would play both their games away.

Though large numbers of travelling Scots to London had been a feature of England-Scotland games for many years, travelling English support to Glasgow was negligible in comparison until 1987 when minor scuffles broke out on the Hampden Park terracing. In 1989, major disturbances across Glasgow were reported as significant numbers of English hooligans appeared at this fixture for the first time. With English club sides banned from European football at the time, the FA were anxious not to see the national side banned too and the Scotland-England match was a high-profile game that brought interest from across the world. This was a major factor in the demise of the fixture.
The cup was discontinued, after five years, in 1989. The annual England vs Scotland fixture was also abandoned at this point. For many years since then, the oldest rivalry in world football was only renewed when the two nations were drawn together in the Euro 96 group stage and in a two-match qualification play-off for Euro 2000. In the 21st century, the teams have only played each other in two friendly matches (August 2013 and November 2014), in two 2018 World Cup qualifying group matches and in the group stage of the UEFA Euro 2020 finals tournament.

In 1986, the England vs Scotland match was played in April, restoring it to the time of the year when it had generally been played in the post-war years before the Home Internationals were concentrated in May from 1969. In every other year, the Rous Cup was played in May. This usually fell just after the domestic seasons in each country had finished. In 1989, it coincided with the end of the English domestic season, which had been extended after fixtures were postponed following the Hillsborough disaster.

<doc id="762870" wikidata="Q590919" url="?curid=762870" title="Genital stage">
<text>The genital stage in psychoanalysis is the term used by Sigmund Freud to describe the final stage of human psychosexual development. The individual develops a strong sexual interest in people outside of the family.

==In Freud and later thinkers==
The notion of the genital stage was added to the &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; (1905), by Sigmund Freud in 1915. In order, these stages of psychosexual development are the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latency stage, and the genital stage. This stage begins around the time that puberty starts, and ends at death. According to Freud, this stage reappears along with the Oedipus complex. The genital stage coincides with the phallic stage, in that its main concern is the genitalia; however, this concern is now conscious.

The genital stage appears when the sexual and aggressive drives have returned. The source of sexual pleasure expands outside of the mother and father. If during the phallic stage, the child was unconsciously attracted to the same-sex parent, then homosexual relationships can occur during this stage. However, this interpretation of the phallic stage, from the following viewpoint, is incongruous with what the primarily understood phallic stage entails. The Oedipus complex, which is one of the most significant components of the phallic stage, can be explained as the need to have the utmost of a response from the parental figure that is the main object of the libido. It must be clarified that it is more often the mother who is giving the gratification in response to a discharge and or manifestation of libido and is therefore the object of the infantile libido—not the father. It is less likely that the subject will have any unconscious sexual attraction to the father because the father is the source of the subject&#x27;s incapability to possessing the mother: the subject is still focused on receiving attention from the mother. Furthermore, all sexual attraction during the phallic stage is purely unconscious.

During the genital stage, the ego and superego have become more developed. This allows the individual to have more realistic ways of thinking and establish an assortment of social relations apart from the family. The genital stage is the latest stage and is considered the highest level of maturity. In this stage, the adult becomes capable of the two signs of maturation: work and love.

The stage is initiated at puberty, but may not be completed until well into the adult years. Otto Fenichel considered genital primacy was the precondition for overcoming ambivalence and for whole-object love.

In 1960, Robert W. White extended Freud&#x27;s genital stage to not only include instinctual needs but effectance. His stage extension included one beginning to decide what role one will play in society and dating for social and sexual satisfaction.

==Prognoses==
The degree to which an individual has reached the genital level was seen by Freudians as inversely correlated with susceptibility to neurosis; conversely, fixation on earlier psychosexual levels will hamper the development of normal sexual relationships.

It is important to note that although oral, anal, and genital are all distinct stages they can occur simultaneously and indefinitely.
Freud argued that an individual could become stuck in any of these stages if overindulgence or underindulgence occurs. If the adult did not successfully complete a stage, fixation may occur later in life.

==Criticism==
While the normal genital character was theoretically recognised as an ideal construct, in practice the concept of the genital level could be fetishized into an addictive goal or commodity, not an experiential reality.

Jacques Lacan wrote of &quot;this absurd hymn to the harmony of the genital&quot; in vulgar Freudianism.

<doc id="762883" wikidata="Q2002465" url="?curid=762883" title="Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Québec">
<text>The Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Québec (&quot;Our Lady of Quebec City&quot;), located at 16, rue de Buade, Quebec City, Quebec, is the primatial church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the oldest church in Canada and was the first church in Canada to be elevated to the rank of minor basilica, by Pope Pius IX in 1874. Four governors of New France and the bishops of Quebec are buried in the crypt, including François de Laval, Quebec&#x27;s first bishop.

The church is a National Historic Site of Canada, and located within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Historic District of Old Québec.

== History ==
The cathedral is located on the site of a chapel, &quot;Notre Dame de la Recouvrance&quot;, constructed by Samuel de Champlain in 1633. Construction of the first cathedral building began in 1647, and it was given the name &quot;Notre-Dame de la Paix&quot;.

The cathedral has twice been destroyed by fire, the first time being during the Siege of Quebec in 1759. It was rebuilt from plans by Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry draughted in 1743. The belltower, however, was designed by Jean Baillairgé, who also oversaw construction. The interior was designed by Jean Baillairgé and his son François from 1786 to 1822. In 1843, François&#x27; son, Thomas, suggested a reconstruction of the façade to resemble the church of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, resulting in the finest Neo-classic façade in Québec. The cathedral was richly decorated with impressive works of art: baldaquin, canopy, episcopal throne dais, stained glass windows, paintings, and chancel lamp (a gift of Louis XIV). 
In 1922 the church was again gutted by fire; the Ku Klux Klan was initially suspected of arson. In 1927, an American career criminal, Ray Marsden confessed in prison to a series of church arsons, including Notre-Dame, that were done to cover his burglaries. The church was restored by architects Maxime Roisin and Raoul Chenevert. Raoul Chenevert added a presbytery beside the cathedral in 1931–1932. From 1961-1993 Claude Lagacé was organist and choirmaster at the cathedral.

In 2014 the cathedral celebrated its 350th anniversary. As part of the celebrations, a holy door was constructed—the second outside Europe and only the eighth in the world. The holy door was opened on December 8, 2013, and remained open until December 28, 2014. It again opened from December 8, 2015, to November 20, 2016, for the Year of Mercy after which it was sealed. It was reopened in 2024 for the 350th anniversary of foundation of the Quebec diocese and sealed again in December of that year, and would not be reopened during the 2025 Jubilee.

The cathedral was designated as a national historic site of Canada in 1989 because &quot;...of its long and close associations with the history of New France; its influence on subsequent ecclesiastical architecture and interior decoration in Québec.&quot;

<doc id="762893" wikidata="Q1050603" url="?curid=762893" title="Deadwood (TV series)">
<text>Deadwood is an American Western television series that aired on the premium cable network HBO from March 21, 2004, to August 27, 2006. The series is set in the 1870s in Deadwood, South Dakota, before and after the area&#x27;s annexation by the Dakota Territory, and charts Deadwood&#x27;s growth from camp to town. The show was created, produced, and largely written by David Milch. &quot;Deadwood&quot; features a large ensemble cast headed by Timothy Olyphant and Ian McShane, playing the real-life Deadwood residents Seth Bullock and Al Swearengen, respectively. Many other historical figures appear as characters, including George Crook, Wyatt Earp, E. B. Farnum, George Hearst, Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Sol Star, A. W. Merrick, Jack McCall, and Charlie Utter. The plot lines involving these characters include historical truths as well as fictional elements. Milch used actual diaries and newspapers from 1870s Deadwood residents as reference points for characters, events, and the look and feel of the show.

&quot;Deadwood&quot; received critical acclaim, particularly for Milch&#x27;s writing and McShane&#x27;s performance, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time. It also won eight Emmy Awards (in 28 nominations) and one Golden Globe. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #8 on its 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;, while the Writers Guild of America ranked it #32 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series. The show was produced by Red Board Productions and Roscoe Productions in association with HBO and Paramount Network Television.

After several years of discussion and pre-production, &quot;&quot; began filming in October 2018. The film is set ten years after the end of the third season and premiered on HBO on May 31, 2019.

==Cast==


==Production==
The first book that the show&#x27;s creator, David Milch, purchased as research for the series was &quot;Deadwood: The Golden Years&quot; by Watson Parker, a historian who specialized in the history of the Black Hills. Milch and his colleagues later bought many of Parker&#x27;s books and papers as references for &quot;Deadwood&quot;.

===Writing===
====Themes====
Milch has pointed out repeatedly in interviews that the intent of the show was to study the way that civilization comes together from chaos by organizing itself around symbols (in &quot;Deadwood&quot; the main symbol is gold). Initially, he intended to study this within Roman civilization (the central symbol was to be the religious cross), but HBO&#x27;s &quot;Rome&quot; series was already in development and Milch was asked by the network if he could stage the story in another place. Although the series touches on a variety of issues including race, prostitution, violence, politics, and immigration, most of the major story lines are grounded in the issue of bringing order from chaos.

====Use of profanity====
From its debut, &quot;Deadwood&quot; drew attention for its extensive profanity. The historical accuracy and dramatic intent of its use of obscenities has been the subject of controversy and discussion. The word &quot;fuck&quot; is said 43 times in the first hour of the show. It has been reported that the series had a total count of 2,980 &quot;fucks&quot; and an average of 1.56 utterances of &quot;fuck&quot; per minute of footage.

==Plot==

===Season 1 (2004)===

The first season takes place in 1876, six months after the founding of the camp, soon after Custer&#x27;s Last Stand. Seth Bullock leaves his job as a marshal in Montana to establish a hardware business in the gold-mining camp of Deadwood, along with his friend and business partner, Sol Star. Wild Bill Hickok, the infamous gunslinger of the west, is on a separate journey to Deadwood, accompanied by Charlie Utter and Calamity Jane. Al Swearengen is the owner of The Gem, a local saloon and brothel. Other notable residents include Dr. Amos Cochran; A. W. Merrick, owner and editor of the local newspaper &quot;The Pioneer&quot;; and E. B. Farnum, proprietor of The Grand Central Hotel.

Bullock encounters a man of an unknown name, who claims that Indians had killed an immigrant family along the road, and he and Hickok along with others ride out to investigate. Swearengen at his saloon offers bounties for Indian scalps, in apparent revenge for the murders, and discounts on booze and women. Bullock and Hickok investigate and find the wagon turned over and all but one of the immigrant family killed. Before sunrise they confront the unknown man and point to holes in his story, saying the raid appeared to be a setup by whites. When he draws his weapon both men draw in defense, and Hickok&#x27;s bullet kills him. Swearengen wakes to hear of these new events as told by Farnum, and is particularly unhappy hearing that one of the immigrant party survived, suspecting that his road agents may have been responsible for the raid.

Brom Garret, a wealthy businessman from New York City, lives at The Grand Central Hotel with his wife, Alma, who nurses a secret laudanum habit. Aware that Garret is interested in prospecting, Swearengen and Farnum deceive him into purchasing a gold claim in a confidence game. Newly arrived Cy Tolliver and his entourage purchase an abandoned hotel across from The Gem and begin renovations, then open the Bella Union Saloon, a luxurious gambling house and brothel. Brom Garret soon learns that his gold claim is worthless and demands Swearengen reimburse his money. Swearengen orders Dan Dority to kill Garret and &quot;make it look like an accident.&quot; Dority throws Garret off a cliff, only to discover that the claim is actually a rich one after all. Newly widowed Alma Garret asks Wild Bill Hickok for guidance regarding the gold claim and Swearengen&#x27;s renewed interest. Hickok asks Bullock to advise Garret; Bullock agrees. Bullock suggests that Garret hire Whitney Ellsworth, a trustworthy and experienced prospector. Alma Garret takes custody of young Norwegian speaking Sofia Metz, whose family was murdered on the way back to Minnesota.

During a poker game, Wild Bill Hickok is murdered by Jack McCall in Tom Nuttall&#x27;s #10 Saloon. When McCall is put on trial, Swearengen leans on the acting magistrate, suggesting that McCall must be acquitted to avoid scrutiny from Washington, D.C. The judge cuts the trial short and the jury acquits McCall, who leaves town immediately after the verdict. Bullock pursues McCall, determined to bring him to justice. Bullock and Charlie Utter later find McCall hiding at a boarding house and take him to Yankton for trial.

Smallpox spreads in Deadwood, creating an urgent need for vaccines. The afflicted are segregated from the main camp in plague tents. Calamity Jane aids Doctor Cochran in caring for the sick.

The senior members of the community form a municipal government to prepare for future annexation, as well as to bribe the territorial legislature, thereby ensuring the security of existing titles, claims and properties. Swearengen bribes local magistrate Clagett to quash a murder warrant.

Alma&#x27;s father Otis Russell arrives with plans to secure Alma&#x27;s new-found wealth in order to pay off his endless debts and fulfill his own greed. The U.S. army arrives in Deadwood and a parade is organized. Bullock confronts a self-confident Otis Russell in The Bella Union. When Russell threatens the safety of his own daughter should Bullock stand in the way of his acquiring the gold claim, Seth unceremoniously beats him and orders Russell to leave the camp.

The increasingly addled Reverend Smith, dying from an apparent brain tumor, is smothered to death by Al Swearengen in a mercy killing. Tolliver attempts to bribe General Crook to leave a garrison in Deadwood but is indignantly refused. When Magistrate Clagett attempts to extort Swearengen further over the murder warrant, Swearengen responds by enlisting Clagett&#x27;s &quot;toll collector&quot;, Silas Adams, to murder Clagett. Silas performs the deed and allies himself with Swearengen, becoming his agent. As Sheriff Con Stapleton has been compromised by Cy Tolliver, Bullock volunteers to become the new sheriff as the cavalry rides out of town.

===Season 2 (2005)===

Season two begins in 1877, seven months after the events of season 1, and the camp has become somewhat more orderly and civilized.

When Swearengen publicly disparages Bullock&#x27;s abilities as sheriff, intimating that Bullock&#x27;s focus is not on his job due to his affair with Alma Garret, Bullock removes his gun and badge and Swearengen and Bullock fight, accidentally falling over the Gem balcony. Al is about to slit Bullock&#x27;s throat in the muddy street, but stops after looking up to see Bullock&#x27;s wife Martha and her son William arriving in camp. Bullock tells Alma they must either leave camp or stop seeing one another. Garret agrees that it is better to end the relationship and remain in town. Calamity Jane resurfaces and manages to support Bullock and Utter in persuading Swearengen to return Bullock&#x27;s gun and badge. A truce is made. Garret discovers she is pregnant by Bullock and confides in Trixie, who persuades Ellsworth to make a marriage proposal to Garret and influences Garret to accept the proposal in order to save her the humiliation of unwed motherhood.

Swearengen collapses in his office with the door locked. His concerned associates assume that he wants to be left alone, but as the day passes their alarm grows and they finally break into the office. Dr. Cochran diagnoses Al with kidney stones and performs a draining procedure. Swearengen eventually passes the stones but has a small stroke in the process.

Joanie Stubbs opens her own brothel, The Chez Amis, with her newly arrived partner Maddie. Francis Wolcott, a geologist working for George Hearst, arrives in Deadwood and soon makes his presence felt at the Chez Amis. Wolcott has paid for the transportation of most of the prostitutes, in order to cater to his selective tastes. Cy Tolliver learns of Wolcott&#x27;s sexual proclivities and baits him, resulting in Wolcott murdering Carrie and Doris, two of Joanie Stubb&#x27;s prostitutes. When Maddie attempts to extort money from Wolcott, he kills her too. Cy Tolliver has the bodies removed and pardons Wolcott. Joanie sends the remaining girls away so that they will be safe from Wolcott. Joanie confides in Charlie Utter regarding the murders, extracting a promise that he never repeats the information.

Alma fires Miss Isringhausen, Sofia&#x27;s tutor. Isringhausen turns to Silas Adams under the pretext of fear for her life at the hands of the Widow Garret, and they embark upon a relationship. Isringhausen convinces Adams to allow her to meet with Swearengen. At the meeting, she admits to being an agent of the Pinkertons under the employ of Brom Garret&#x27;s family, who instructed Isringhausen to frame Alma for soliciting Swearengen to murder her husband. Swearengen agrees to play along, but later reveals to Garret that he intends to blackmail Isringhausen due to his hatred for the Pinkerton agency.

Samuel Fields, &quot;The Nigger General&quot;, returns to camp. He tries to enlist Hostetler in his schemes. Bullock is forced to rescue him from an angry mob headed by Steve, a virulently racist drunk. Later, Hostetler catches a drunken Steve in the livery stable masturbating on Bullock&#x27;s horse in revenge. Fields and Hostetler manage to coerce Steve into signing a written confession of bestiality. The admission will be publicized should Steve make any trouble for either of the livery workers in the future.

Hugo Jarry, a Yankton commissioner, tries to persuade Swearengen and Tolliver that Deadwood should become part of Dakota territory rather than Montana. He ends up siding with Swearengen.

Alma Garret enlists the help of Sol Star to establish a bank in the camp.

Wolcott&#x27;s agent Lee burns the bodies of captive Chinese prostitutes who have died from malnourishment while under his control. Mr. Wu is enraged and requests Swearengen&#x27;s help to stop Lee. Because Lee is employed by Wolcott, who is in turn employed by George Hearst, Swearengen refuses any help until after negotiations over the town&#x27;s future have been resolved. Mr. Wu escapes Swearengen&#x27;s house arrest at The Gem, but Johnny Burns stops him from exacting his revenge on Lee or being killed himself.

William Bullock is trampled by a horse that escapes during a failed gelding and dies several hours after. His funeral is attended by many of Deadwood&#x27;s citizens and the service is conducted by former card sharp Andy Cramed, who has returned to Deadwood an ordained minister.

George Hearst arrives in Deadwood and when he learns of the murders committed by Wolcott, confronts and fires him. Hearst purchases the Grand Central hotel from E. B. Farnum. The shamed Wolcott hangs himself. Tolliver claims to be in possession of a letter of confession in which Wolcott states that Hearst was aware of his murderous ways, yet continued his employment. Tolliver blackmails Hearst for 5% of every gold claim he has acquired in Deadwood.

Al Swearengen negotiates with George Hearst on behalf of Mr. Wu, and they agree that Wu can regain his status if his people prove to be better workers than those of the &quot;San Francisco cocksucker&quot; Lee. Mr. Wu and Swearengen&#x27;s henchmen plan vengeance in Deadwood&#x27;s Chinatown. The operation is successful and Wu slits the throat of his rival.

Alma Garret and Ellsworth marry at a ceremony conducted by Andy Cramed at the Grand Central hotel. After much dealing and double-dealing on the part of Swearengen and Silas Adams, the official papers confirming Deadwood&#x27;s annexation into Yankton territory are signed by Bullock and Swearengen with Hugo Jarry present. Andy Cramed stabs Tolliver outside the Bella Union.

===Season 3 (2006)===

Season three begins less than six weeks after the events of season 2. Government and law, as well as the interests of powerful commercial entities, begin to enter the town as Deadwood prepares itself for entry into Dakota Territory.

Hearst has several of his own Cornish miners murdered when they attempt to unionize. Elections are announced: Star and Farnum run for Mayor, while Bullock and barman Harry Manning compete for Sheriff. Angered that Hearst had someone killed in the Gem, Al cancels the election debates in an attempt to reassert his position in the camp. To teach Al a lesson and force him to help Hearst buy Alma&#x27;s claim, Hearst has his lead henchman Captain Turner restrain Al, then chops off one of his fingers.

Over Ellsworth&#x27;s strong objections, Alma meets with Hearst to discuss buying her claim. Hearst becomes furious when she offers him a merely non-controlling interest and behaves menacingly towards Alma, but then allows her to leave without following through on his implied threat of rape.

Tolliver slowly recovers after being stabbed and gets back on his feet. Hearst knows Cy is lying about having a letter from Wolcott but decides to employ Cy to help deal with the members of the camp. Traveling actor Jack Langrishe arrives in Deadwood with his theatre troupe. He is an old friend of Swearengen&#x27;s and eventually buys the former Chez Amis (now a school house) from Joannie Stubbs on condition that he build a new school for the camp&#x27;s children. Alma undergoes a D &amp; C by Doc Cochran when her pregnancy threatens her health.

Hostetler and Samuel Fields return to the camp to find that Steve has taken over the livery. Bullock mediates between them, eventually getting Hostetler to agree to sell the Livery to Steve. Steve&#x27;s ranting, racial slurs and impugning of Hostetler&#x27;s honor finally drive the latter over the edge and he shoots himself.

Another miner is killed. Already angry from the Hostetler/Steve ordeal, Bullock arrests Hearst, drags him by the ear through the public thoroughfare and puts him in jail overnight.

Alma is once again using dope. Leon confesses to Cy that he is Alma&#x27;s supplier. Cy relays this news to Hearst but Hearst is still angry from his encounter with Bullock and believes that if Tolliver had told him this useful news beforehand he might not have provoked the sheriff. A furious Tolliver tells Leon to do nothing, but Leon, afraid of being implicated in Alma&#x27;s murder, has already cut her off. Suspecting that Alma&#x27;s return to drugs is due to her unhappiness at being married to a man she doesn&#x27;t love, Ellsworth moves out of their house. They later agree to separate and Alma is able to stop taking the laudanum.

Hearst brings a large force of Pinkertons to the camp and encourages them to stir up trouble. Swearengen holds a meeting to decide what to do about Hearst. The town leaders are unable to decide on any direct action, other than to publish a letter from Bullock to the wife of one of the murdered miners that subtly highlights Hearst&#x27;s callousness. Hearst has Merrick beaten for publishing it.

Alma is shot at in the street. Swearengen takes her into the Gem and orders Dan to kidnap and restrain Ellsworth. Al guesses, correctly, that Hearst ordered the shooting, in an attempt to provoke then kill Ellsworth when he comes to Alma&#x27;s aid. Hearst sends his second, the same man that beat Merrick and possibly also shot at Alma, to negotiate with Swearengen; Al kills him after extracting information. The town unites to protect Alma as she returns to work at the bank. Hearst has Ellsworth assassinated in his tent at Alma&#x27;s mine. Trixie shoots Hearst in revenge for Ellsworth&#x27;s death but fails to kill him. Fearing for her and Sofia&#x27;s lives and unwilling to make the camp responsible for her protection, Alma sells her claim to Hearst to avoid further bloodshed.

Bullock receives discouraging news about the county election returns in his race for sheriff against Harry Manning, all the while knowing Hearst may have manipulated the results using Federal soldiers brought in to vote for his handpicked candidate elsewhere in the county.

Hearst demands that the whore who shot him be executed. Swearengen and Wu gather a militia in case a war breaks out. Al murders the prostitute Jen, despite Johnny&#x27;s objections, in the hope of passing her corpse off as Trixie and placating Hearst. The ruse works and Hearst leaves Deadwood, giving over control of &quot;all his other-than-mining interests&quot; to Tolliver. Tolliver points a gun at Hearst from his balcony and wants to shoot him but instead watches as Bullock sees a smirking Hearst out of the camp. Enraged that Hearst is cutting him off, Tolliver takes his frustrations out on Leon by stabbing him in the femoral artery. Johnny and Al speak briefly of Jen&#x27;s death, before Al returns to scrubbing her bloodstain.

===&quot;Deadwood: The Movie&quot; (2019)===

In 1889, past and present residents of Deadwood are reunited to celebrate South Dakota&#x27;s impending entrance into the Union as the 40th state.

==Film continuation==

Following the cancellation of the series, it was reported on June 7, 2006, that HBO and creator David Milch had agreed to make two two-hour television films in place of a fourth season, after Milch declined a short-order of six episodes. This was because in the show&#x27;s original format, each season portrayed two weeks in the life of Deadwood, with each episode representing one day. The final two-hour format would release these time restraints and allow for a broader narrative to finish off the series. In an interview on January 13, 2007, Milch stated that he still intended to finish the two films, if possible. On July 12, 2007, HBO executives admitted that producing the telefilms would be difficult and put the chances of their ever being made at &quot;50–50&quot;.

In an interview on October 1, 2007, actor Ian McShane claimed that the show&#x27;s sets were due to be dismantled, and the movies would not be made; however, he was referring to the show-related set pieces, i.e., front added to the buildings, props, etc., the set as itself, &quot;Melody Ranch&quot;, being unchanged at least as of 2010. Actors Jim Beaver and W. Earl Brown commented a day later that they considered the series to be over. In the March 17, 2009, episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, McShane repeated that &quot;&quot;Deadwood&quot; is dead.&quot; In a January 14, 2011, interview in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Milch said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know that the last word has been said on the subject ... I still nourish the hope that we&#x27;re going to get to do a little more work in that area.&quot; In a March 21, 2012, interview, Milch was asked if the movies would ever be produced and replied, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think so. We got really close about a year ago. Never say never, but it doesn&#x27;t look that way.&quot;

On August 12, 2015, it was reported that talks between HBO and Milch had resumed regarding a &quot;Deadwood&quot; film. In January 2016, HBO gave Milch the green-light to write a script for the film. On August 1, 2016, Casey Bloys, HBO&#x27;s new head of programming, stated that Milch was writing the script for a &quot;Deadwood&quot; movie. On April 19, 2017, McShane announced that Milch submitted a script for a two-hour &quot;Deadwood&quot; movie to HBO, saying: &quot;[A] two-hour movie script has been delivered to HBO. If they don&#x27;t deliver [a finished product], blame them.&quot; McShane said that he hoped to discuss the film with Milch further, and said of the original cast returning that &quot;we&#x27;d all love to do it ... It would be nice to see all of the old gang again.&quot; On November 12, 2017, TVLine reported that the &quot;Deadwood&quot; movie was set to begin production in fall 2018, although HBO had not officially green-lit the project.

In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on July 20, 2018, Robin Weigert said that a &quot;Deadwood&quot; film would likely be filmed in the fall of 2018: &quot;It&#x27;s safe enough to say [the film] is happening this fall.&quot; She explained: &quot;There&#x27;s a set being built and tax incentives to get it done. A lot of [actors] have signed on. There&#x27;s a 90% chance it&#x27;ll finally happen.&quot; Five days later, on July 25, HBO confirmed that a &quot;Deadwood&quot; movie had been greenlit and that Dan Minahan, who directed four episodes in the series&#x27; original run, would direct the film, with production set to begin in October 2018. On August 21, 2018, W. Earl Brown gave his thoughts on the final draft of the script saying, &quot;in the course of those two hours, my emotions ricocheted in every fucking direction: exhilaration to melancholy; hoots of joy to screams of despair. The Maestro has topped himself. The structure is essentially the same as the first version I read a year and a half ago, but the complexities of the relationships, the emotional peaks and depths, are all sharpened to a razor fine edge. It&#x27;s gut wrenching.&quot;

Brown also confirmed that, &quot;Everyone from the main cast who still draws air, with the exception of Silas Adams (Titus Welliver)&quot;, would return. Some members of the original series&#x27; cast, including Powers Boothe, Ricky Jay, and Ralph Richeson, died between the conclusion of the series&#x27; first run and production of the film continuation. Boothe&#x27;s small role in an early version of the script was written out, and the characters played by Jay and Richeson were not recast. Welliver was unable to appear in the film due to scheduling conflicts, as he was filming his Amazon Prime series &quot;Bosch&quot;. Garret Dillahunt and Larry Cedar, who played characters who were killed in the original series, returned as background characters; Dillahunt plays a drunk who throws something at Hearst, yelling: &quot;Hope you die in the street, like my dad did!&quot;

Production on the film began on October 5, 2018, according to Brown. On November 5, 2018, HBO announced that the film had begun production, confirming the returns of several cast members. The film premiered on HBO on May 31, 2019, and received critical acclaim.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Deadwood&quot; received widespread praise from critics over the course of its three-year run. On Metacritic, the first season has an 80 out of 100 score sampled from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The second season scored 93 out of 100 based on 15 critics, and third season scored 85 out of 100 based on 20 critics, both indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, with only one mixed review of the third season coming from &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Verne Gay.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 85% based on 39 reviews, with an average score of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Deadwood&quot;″s absorbing first season presents a vivid, un-sanitized depiction of a frontier town that stakes its claim alongside other classic entries in the Western genre.&quot; The second season has an approval rating of 96% based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 9.5/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Amid the grit and lawlessness, season two of &quot;Deadwood&quot; offers a richly textured portrait of an Old West community buoyed by its talented ensemble cast.&quot; The third season has an approval rating of 95% based on 38 reviews, with an average score of 9/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Deadwood&quot;″s final season ends with a frustrating lack of closure, but that ambiguous final note doesn&#x27;t detract from an outstanding series that ranks among the best the genre has to offer.&quot;

The praise generally centered on the strength of the writing and Milch&#x27;s unique style of dialogue. &quot;Time Out New York&quot;&#x27;s Andrew Johnston listed &quot;Deadwood&quot; in his top ten TV shows for both 2005 and 2006, commenting: &quot;If history is written by the victors, &quot;Deadwood&quot; is all about giving the losers their due. In the first season, magnificent bastard Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) came off as a villain; this year, his inevitably doomed campaign to save the lawless town from annexation by the United States and exploitation by robber barons served as a brilliant allegory for the evolution of American capitalism.&quot; Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz considers &quot;Deadwood&quot; to be &quot;the greatest TV show ever&quot; and he wrote a 2022 book detailing the making of the series titled &quot;The Deadwood Bible: A Lie Agreed Upon&quot;. Matt Zoller Seitz and Alan Sepinwall listed &quot;Deadwood&quot; as the ninth greatest series of all time in their &quot;TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="762899" wikidata="Q521020" url="?curid=762899" title="Huahine">
<text>Huahine is an island located among the Society Islands, in French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France in the South Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Leeward Islands group &quot;(Îles sous le Vent).&quot; At the 2022 census it had a population of 6,263.

==History==
Human presence on Huahine dates back to at least a millennium ago, as evinced by the numerous Marae on the island. Archaeologists estimate that the ancient Tahitian Maohi people colonized Huahine from at least the 9th century AD. Huahine is home to one of the largest concentrations of Polynesian archaeological remains dated between 850 AD and 1100 AD.

=== Independent kingdom===
Until the late 19th century Huahine was an independent kingdom, also called the Huahine and Maiao Kingdom. According to tradition, three main dynasties succeeded each other:

The Hau-moo-rere dynasty was founded in the 17th century; its last representative was Queen Tehaapapa I, whom Captain Cook met in 1769. She maintained the cohesion and independence of her kingdom.

The Tamatoa dynasty has its origin in Tehaapapa I and her husband Mato a Tamatoa, member of the Tamatoa family of Raiatea. They were the founders of the Tamatoa branch of Huahine. This dynasty reigned until 1854.

The Teururai dynasty descends from Ariimate Teururai, a Huahine chief, and his wife Teriiteporouarai Tamatoa, member of the Tamatoa family of Raiatea, great-granddaughter of Queen Tehaapapa I of Huahine. This dynasty reigned from 1854 to 1895.

The Polynesian prince Teriifaatau Marama could lay claim to the thrones of Huahine and Raiatea at the same time. However, the union of these two thrones under one scepter was unacceptable to both kingdoms so it was agreed that his younger brother would inherit the throne of Raiatea. In 1884, Teriifaatau Marama obtained the position of prime minister, a post previously held by his younger brother, who had become King that year. Teriifaatau Marama became a principle figure in the annexation of the kingdom of Huahine and Maiao by France. It was in 1895 that the regent, on behalf of Queen Tehaapapa, and the principal chiefs of the kingdom fully renounced their powers and privileges in favor of France, in a treaty of abdication dated 15 September of that year. After the annexation he was elected chief of Tefarerii, a position he held until his death.

=== European exploration and colonization===
The name Huahine literally means &quot;woman&#x27;s sex&quot;. It could probably be translated as &quot;pregnant woman&quot; since the profile of Mount Tavaiura makes one think of a pregnant woman lying down. 

Captain James Cook arrived in Fare Harbour on 16 July 1769, with Tupaia navigating . They met with leading chief Ori (Mato). Cook returned on 3 September 1773 and met with Ori&#x27;s son Teriitaria, the new arii rahi of the island.

Missionary Auna served as a deacon on Huahine prior to his work in Hawaii.

The Spaniard Domingo Bonaechea in 1775, called the island &quot;La Hermosa&quot; (The Beautiful). Today it is known by the nickname &quot;the island of the woman&quot;.

In 1846 the island successfully resisted French rule, the inhabitants never resigned themselves to the idea of being colonized and in 1847 the island proclaimed itself an independent state under the name of the Kingdom of Huahine.

On 20 April 1879, the commander of the SMS Bismarck, Karl Deinhard, and the German Empire&#x27;s consul for the South Sea Islands, Gustav Godeffroy Junior, signed a treaty of friendship and commerce with the island&#x27;s government on behalf of the German Empire.

In 1888 the French finally established a protectorate over the Island. The island was formally annexed on 18 April 1888. French warships bombarded the two largest villages, causing some loss of life, in September 1890. The last queen, Te-haapapa III, was deposed, and the island incorporated into the French Establishments of Oceania, in 1895.

==Geography==
Huahine measures in length, with a maximum width of . It is made up of two main islands surrounded by a fringing coral reef with several islets, or &quot;motu.&quot; Huahine Nui (Big Huahine) lies to the north and Huahine Iti (Little Huahine) to the south. The total land area is . The two islands are separated by a few hundred metres of water and joined by a sandspit at low tide. A small bridge was built to connect Huahine Nui and Huahine Iti. Its highest point is Turi, at 669 m elevation.

In the northwest of Huahine Nui lies a brackish lake known as Lac Fauna Nui (Lac Maeva). This lake is all that remains of the ancient atoll lagoon. Air transportation is available via Huahine airport, located on the northern shore of Huahine Nui.

=== Flora and fauna===

The island is covered with lush vegetation, much of which consists of coconut palms. There are also two important botanical gardens: the Ariiura Garden Paradise, which houses traditional Polynesian medicinal plants, and l&#x27;Eden Parc, where fruit trees from the rest of the world are cultivated.

The fauna is especially rich in fish and birds. Among the latter is a species that became extinct centuries ago, the Huahine starling (&quot;Aplonis diluvialis&quot;), whose fossils found on the island date its disappearance some seven centuries ago (although the German naturalist Georg Forster depicted in the 18th century a bird on the island of Raiatea very similar to the animal in question). In 2019 the &quot;Partula rosea&quot; and &quot;Partula varia&quot; snails were reintroduced to the island.

In February 2024 the Ornithological Society of Polynesia reintroduced the Tahitian Striated heron to the island.

==Administration==

Administratively Huahine is a commune (municipality) part of the administrative subdivision of the Leeward Islands. Huahine consists of the following associated communes:
* Faie
* Fare
* Haapu
* 
* 

The administrative centre of the commune is the settlement of Fare, on Huahine Nui.

== Demographics==
The total population was 5,999 inhabitants in the 2007 census, which increased to 6,263 inhabitants in 2022, distributed in eight villages: Fare (the capital), Maeva, Faie, Fitii, Parea, Tefarerii, Haapu and Maroe.

The main activities are vanilla cultivation, copra production, fishing and tourism.
=== Sport===
In terms of sports, Huahine is, along with neighboring Bora Bora, Tahaa and Raiatea, one of the four islands among which the , an international Polynesian canoe (vaa) competition, is held.

=== Religion===
Most of the population follows Christianity as a result of the activity of missionaries from both the Catholic Church and various Protestant groups, and European colonization.

In 1809 the island had its first contact with Protestant Christian missionaries. In 1815 the Protestant mission ordered the destruction of the idols of the ancient gods of the local religion. In the following decades, Catholic missionaries arrived. Between 1819 and 1820 the first chapel was built on the island.

Catholics, under the direction of the Archdiocese of Papeete, administer one religious building, the Church of the Holy Family (&quot;Église de la Sainte-Famille&quot;) which was reopened in the town of Fare (northwest of the island) on 30 October 2010. The original church had been established however between 1906 and 1909.

== Economy==

The inhabitants of the island are engaged in activities such as agriculture and fishing. Agricultural products include vanilla (&quot;Vanilla × tahitensis&quot; species) and various types of melons. Thanks to the lush coconut forest, copra production is also a very important activity for the local economy.

=== Tourism===
Tourism through cruise ship passengers calling at the atoll and the airport is another important economic sector.

One of the famous attractions on Huahine is a bridge that crosses over a stream with long freshwater eels. These eels are deemed sacred by the locals, by local mythology. While viewing these slithering creatures, tourists can buy a can of mackerel and feed the eels. The Faahia archaeological site in the north of the island has revealed subfossil remains of several species of extinct birds exterminated by the earliest Polynesian colonists of the island.

==Transportation==

The island has scheduled passenger airline flights operated by Air Tahiti with ATR turboprop aircraft via the Huahine - Fare Airport.

<text>Columbia Park or Columbia Avenue Grounds was a baseball park in Philadelphia. It was built in 1901 as the first home of the Philadelphia Athletics, who played there for eight seasons, including two games of the 1905 World Series.

Columbia Park fell into disuse after the Athletics&#x27; move in 1909 to the larger Shibe Park, and was demolished in the 1910s.

==Home of the Philadelphia Athletics==
 
During their tenure at Columbia Park, the Athletics won the American League pennant twice. The first time was in 1902, before the institution of the modern World Series. 

Columbia Park was built in 1901 by the Philadelphia Athletics when the team was established, in the creation of the American League. The site was a vacant lot on which manager and part-owner Connie Mack obtained a ten-year lease. It occupied the block bordered by 29th Street, Oxford Street, 30th Street, and Columbia Avenue (later renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue, in honor of the civil rights leader). 

The park was built by contractor James B. Foster, at a cost of $35,000, equal to $ today. In contrast to the Phillies&#x27; Philadelphia Ball Park built in 1887 and rebuilt in 1894 with non-union labor, the Athletics employed exclusively union labor in Columbia Park&#x27;s 1901 construction. This drew the praise of Philadelphia&#x27;s union leaders who declared in April 1901, &quot;[we] welcome [the Athletics] amongst us as brother unionists, and promise them our support and assistance, and bespeak for them the hearty goodwill, favor and patronage of all self-respecting citizens of Philadelphia.

The stadium was small and originally had a seating capacity of only 9,500. This was increased to 13,600 by the addition of bleacher seating in the outfield. During some sold out games, unofficial additional seating could be found on top of the adjoining homes. There was only one dressing room, for the home team; visiting teams had to change at their hotels. Although the ballpark was in Philadelphia&#x27;s Brewerytown section, beer sales were prohibited.

The A&#x27;s practiced at the park for the first time on April 5, 1901, with 600 fans in attendance. The first game at the ballpark was on April 8, 1901; the A&#x27;s defeated Frank Moss&#x27; Professionals 8–1 in front of 1,000 fans on a cold and bleak day. Bill Bernhard started for the Athletics and his first pitch to Arlie Latham was a strike. 

The first official game in Columbia Park was held on April 26, 1901, after the first two games were rained out. The Athletics played the Washington Senators in front of a crowd of 10,524, with some fans standing on the outfield walls and the roofs of nearby houses. The Athletics lost 5–1, despite three hits by second baseman Nap Lajoie.

Following their successful 1902 season, the Athletics built a narrow upper deck on the rooftop of the ballpark.

The Phillies&#x27; Philadelphia Ball Park had suffered a fatal collapse of its left field bleachers in 1903. Prior to the 1905 season, the Athletics reinforced Columbia Park&#x27;s seating and grandstands with heavy yellow pine joists which received the approval of the City of Philadelphia&#x27;s Chief of the Bureau of Building Inspections.

The Athletics won their second pennant in 1905, and faced the New York Giants in the 1905 World Series. The Giants won the series 4 games to 1. Games 1 and 3 were held at Columbia Park. Both were shutout victories for Giants future hall of famer Christy Mathewson.

The Athletics reconstructed the left and right bleachers prior to the 1906 season. The bleachers had previously run straight from the grandstand along 30th Street to Columbia Avenue. They were angled in such way that spectators at the Columbia Avenue end were unable to see the infield over fans in front of them. The club rebuilt the bleachers in a semi-circle, the seats reaching to the left field foul line and facing the infield and home plate, using heavy Florida yellow pine timber.

==Other teams==
The Philadelphia Phillies temporarily called Columbia Park home in 1903 while Baker Bowl was repaired after a balcony collapse on August 8, 1903. The Phillies played sixteen games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.

The stadium also briefly served as the home of the Philadelphia Athletics football club, before the team folded in 1902.

The Athletics leased the ballpark to the independent Negro league club the Philadelphia Giants. The Giants played at the ballpark while the Athletics were on the road. The Giants were the first club to play night baseball in Philadelphia when they played under portable lights on June 4, 1902.

==Disuse and demolition==
The final game played at the park took place on October 3, 1908; the visiting Boston Americans defeated the Athletics 5–0 in the second game of a doubleheader. The lack of seating at Columbia Park was the main reason the Athletics left for Shibe Park. The sod from Columbia Park was transplanted to Shibe Park after the 1908 season.

After the Athletics left, the park was almost entirely abandoned. Columbia Park was eventually demolished in the 1910s to make way for new homes.

<text>Charles Cadman (February 21, 1948 – July 9, 2005) was a Canadian politician and Member of Parliament (MP) from 1997 to 2005, representing the riding of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia.

Originally a Canadian Alliance MP, Cadman won re-election as an independent after losing a nomination race in his own riding. This history garnered him national media attention when, on May 19, 2005, Cadman cast a deciding tie vote to save a minority Liberal government supported by the NDP that the Conservative party at the time was trying to defeat to trigger an election.

== Early life ==
Cadman was born in Kitchener, Ontario, and grew up in North Bay, Ontario. He was a guitarist with a band called &quot;The Fringe&quot;, which toured Canada. He also played backup to The Guess Who on CBC Television. He eventually settled in Surrey, British Columbia. He attended the British Columbia Institute of Technology and became a certified electrical and electronics engineering technician. He worked for ten years as a microfiche camera technician for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. He married Dona Cadman in 1969; they had two children: Jodi and Jesse.

== Political career ==
On October 18, 1992, Cadman&#x27;s 16-year-old son Jesse was stabbed to death in a random street attack by a group of young people. In response to Jesse&#x27;s death, Cadman and his wife Dona created the group CRY – Crime Responsibility and Youth – and counselled teens likely to become violent. He also campaigned for a tougher Young Offenders Act. His activism against youth violence propelled him into politics, first to carry on his fight against youth violence and for victims&#x27; rights. He was first elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1997 election as a member of the Reform Party of Canada. He introduced a private members bill which proposed to raise the maximum jail term for parents whose children commit crimes while under their supervision. This bill was later incorporated into Canada&#x27;s Youth Criminal Justice Act in November 2000. He was also known for wearing a ponytail and blue jeans in Parliament.

He was re-elected under the banner of the Canadian Alliance in the 2000 election, and was appointed Justice Critic. However, prior to the 2004 election Cadman lost the nomination for the Conservative Party to Jasbir Singh Cheema, a former television news anchor who brought a very large number of new party members to the vote. Cadman was also diagnosed with cancer in early May 2004 and underwent surgery to remove a tumour from his groin. He then ran as an independent in that election and was elected. He heard about the election call from his hospital bed.

He was the only candidate not affiliated with a party to win a seat in the 2004 election, and remained an independent, refusing offers to rejoin the Conservatives. Originally sitting as the only independent in a minority government, Cadman held considerable power. (Carolyn Parrish, David Kilgour, and Pat O&#x27;Brien – all elected as Liberals – would later sit as independents.)

===2005 budget vote===

On May 19, 2005, Cadman flew to Ottawa for a confidence vote not long after undergoing chemotherapy treatment for malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Cadman voted with the government on the 2005 budget, which had incorporated amendments proposed by the NDP, and forced a tie in the House of Commons. The tie was broken by Peter Milliken the Speaker of the House of Commons, who voted in favour of the Liberal budget (who explained he simply did so because the Speaker traditionally votes to continue a government). The budget was later passed in Cadman&#x27;s absence on June 23, 2005. In an interview after the budget vote, Cadman said he voted in favour of the budget simply because he was obeying the wishes of constituents who did not want to face another election a year after giving the minority Liberals their shaky mandate.

=== Allegations of bribery, the tape, the lawsuit ===
Dona Cadman says that her husband told her that prior to the vote, two Conservative Party officials, later suggested to be Tom Flanagan and Doug Finley, offered her husband a million-dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote against the Liberal budget in May 2005, the rationale being replacement of the life insurance that is part of an MP&#x27;s compensation package (since Cadman was not running for re-election and would thus not die an MP if he voted down the government). An audio tape suggests then-opposition leader Stephen Harper was not only aware of a financial offer to Chuck Cadman but gave it his personal approval. According to Dona Cadman, Harper &quot;looked me straight in the eyes and told me he had no knowledge of an insurance policy offer. I knew he was telling me the truth; I could see it in his eyes.&quot; Cadman&#x27;s daughter also acknowledged that her father had been disturbed by the offer. Harper later stated in an August 2008 court deposition that he personally authorized an offer made to Cadman in 2005; however, this offer was of the normal amount offered to a candidate running in an election campaign. The Conservative Party, based upon analysis by forensic experts who concluded that the tape was edited, asked an Ontario court to order to Liberals to stop using the tape. But neutral expert testimony showed that the tape has not been edited.

Under section 119 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, it is illegal to bribe an MP. Accordingly, Opposition Liberal party Intergovernmental Affairs critic Dominic LeBlanc asked the RCMP in February 2008 to investigate the allegation that the Conservatives had offered Cadman a million-dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his support on the budget vote. In May 2008, the RCMP announced that there was no evidence to support charges.

James Moore, Conservative MP for Port Moody—Westwood—Port Coquitlam told a news conference June 4, 2008, that two top audio specialists found that the tape in which PM Stephen Harper confirms financial considerations had been offered to Chuck Cadman had been altered. But LeBlanc said on June 5, 2008, that the Tories have not been clear about what they claim was doctored on the tape. He said the Tories have also forgotten a huge part of the allegations – the testimony of Cadman&#x27;s widow, Dona Cadman. In her affidavit, Dona Cadman &quot;repeats very clearly her recollection of her husband&#x27;s words to the effect that two Conservative operatives ... offered him a million dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote&quot;, said LeBlanc.

Tom Zytaruk, the reporter who made the recording said &quot;I know I didn&#x27;t doctor any tape. So in a sense all this stuff that [Conservative MP] James Moore is saying is meaningless. I know what happened.&quot;

In early July 2008, Dona Cadman swore an affidavit that challenged some of Tom Zytaruk&#x27;s assertions. She denied specific public accounts by Zytaruk of how he came to meet Harper that day, and he professed himself &quot;extremely surprised, disappointed and deeply distressed&quot; by her statement.

=== Political libel chill ===
Liberals redoubled their use of the Cadman material – some argued that the RCMP inaction was possibly due to political interference while others argued that the standard of proof for criminal law was too high to satisfy when an official was willing to commit perjury. Neither of these allegations were made through official channels.

However, the bold statement that &quot;Harper knew of Conservative bribery&quot; did appear as the title of a press release. In a rare political libel case, Prime Minister Harper filed a libel lawsuit against the Liberal Party over statements on the party&#x27;s website regarding the Chuck Cadman affair published under this title.

With the filing of the suit, open political comment on the case effectively stopped, an example of libel chill.

The suit was settled in February 2009 after Michael Ignatieff took over leadership of the Party.

== Death ==
On July 9, 2005, Cadman died at his home after a two-year-long bout with malignant melanoma. Cadman&#x27;s memorial service was held on July 16, 2005, at Johnston Heights Church in Surrey. Over 1,500 people were in attendance: in addition to family, friends, and politicians of all parties in the church itself, Cadman&#x27;s constituents packed the neighbouring assembly hall and courtyard to pay their last respects by watching the service on television screens. Speeches honouring Cadman as a family man, parliamentarian, and advocate for victim&#x27;s rights were made by Cadman&#x27;s daughter, Jodi, Prime Minister Paul Martin, BC MLA Kevin Falcon, BC MLA Dave Hayer, Surrey City Councillor Penny Priddy and several others.

On 15 March 2008, Vancouver journalist Tom Zytaruk published a biography of Cadman entitled &quot;Like A Rock: The Chuck Cadman Story&quot;, in which the bribery allegations are explored in depth.

His widow, Dona, endorsed Penny Priddy as Cadman&#x27;s successor in the 2006 federal election. Priddy, a longtime member of the New Democratic Party, had been friendly with the Cadmans for many years despite their sharp political differences. Dona Cadman subsequently reconciled with the Conservatives and was elected to her husband&#x27;s seat in 2008. She only held it for one term before it fell to the NDP in 2011.

<text>The Greens ( ) is a political party in Poland.

It was formed in 2003 under the name &quot;Greens 2004&quot; and formally registered itself in February 2004. It supports principles of green politics, and it is positioned on the centre-left and leans towards the left-wing. The party is an international member of the Global Greens, European member of European Green Party and cooperates with the European Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament.

== History ==

The party was established in 2003 by activists of several social movements. Among its founding members were environmentalists, feminists, LGBT people and anti-war activists. The first political campaign of the emerging party concerned the Polish European Union membership referendum, the Greens campaigned for a &quot;yes&quot; vote.

Greens 2004 took part in the movement against the Iraq War in 2003 and participated in Equality Parades and other social protests in the time of &quot;Fourth Republic&quot; (2005–2007). Since 3 March 2013, the official name of the party is Partia Zieloni (The Greens), while Greens 2004 is a historical name and can still be used.

During the late 2000s and the early 2010s, the party cooperated with various socialist parties in the elections.

The party was represented in the Sejm between 2014 and 2015 by Anna Grodzka (she was elected as Palikot&#x27;s Movement member in 2011). By the mid-2010s, the party lost many members (e. g. Marcelina Zawisza), who formed new party called Razem (Together).

Since 2018, the party began to cooperate with Civic Platform and Modern parties. In 2019, as part of Civic Coalition, it won three seats in Sejm. These representatives became members of Civic Coalition parliamentary group. On 8 March 2023, Klaudia Jachira, previously independent representative within Civic Platform, joined The Greens.

== Electoral History ==

=== European Parliament election of 2004 ===
In the 2004 European Parliament election, the Greens received 0.27% of the votes.

=== Polish presidential election of 2005 ===
In the 2005 presidential election, the Greens supported Marek Borowski, the chairman of the SDPL, who received 10.33% of the votes.

=== Polish local elections of 2006 ===
In the 2006 local elections, the Greens structured themselves and decided on the formula for the start of elections (because the party&#x27;s national authorities rejected the invitation to the alliance of the Left and Democrats). The independent list of the Greens in Warsaw received 11 210 votes (1.68%) and 7th place out of 14. Less than 1% of support was obtained in Wrocław and Gdańsk by the local committees co-created by the Greens with Young Socialists. In other cities, people associated with the party were candidates from local, mainly non-party lists or the Left and Democrats coalition.

=== Polish parliamentary election of 2007 ===
In the 2007 parliamentary election, the Greens contested one district in the Senate.

=== European Parliament election of 2009 ===
In February 2009, the Greens formed a coalition called Alliance for the Future &quot;(Porozumienie dla Przyszłości - CentroLewica)&quot; with the social liberal Democratic Party and the social democratic SDPL, forming a common list for the 2009 European Parliament election.

=== Polish presidential election of 2010 ===
In the 2010 presidential election, the Greens supported Grzegorz Napieralski based on the analysis of the programs of the most important candidates. The SLD candidate obtained the highest score in the Green Index ranking: 78 on a scale from -200 to +200 points. In the second round, the party members encouraged to vote, but they did not support any of the candidates, pointing to their conservatism and economic neoliberalism.

=== Polish local elections of 2010 ===
In the 2010 local elections, members of the Greens ran in most cases from the lists of Democratic Left Alliance. In these elections, the Greens won five seats in local councils and regional parliaments.

=== Polish parliamentary election of 2011 ===
In the 2011 parliamentary election, representatives of the party again found themselves on the lists of the Democratic Left Alliance, but they did not obtain any seats in the Sejm. The Green candidates themselves gained 23 421 votes, which gave 0.16% of the votes. The only one of the Greens was their chairman Dariusz Szwed opening the list in the Chrzanów constituency, in which he obtained 3 842 votes.

=== European Parliament election of 2014 ===
In the 2014 European Parliament election, the Greens formed their own Election Committee of the Greens. The representatives of the Women&#x27;s Party, the Polish Socialist Party and Young Socialists have announced the start of the Green Committee&#x27;s lists. The Committee registered lists in five districts. The Committee of the Greens obtained 22 221 votes (0.32%) in the elections, taking the 10th place (ahead of, among others, the Direct Democracy committee, whose lists were registered in six districts).

=== Polish local elections of 2014 ===
In the 2014 local elections, the Greens issued their own letters to the city council in Warsaw and Wrocław, in Warsaw, issuing Joanna Erbel as their own candidate for the city&#x27;s presidency, and in Wrocław supporting the SLD candidate. In Kraków, together with trade unions and city movements, they co-founded the Kraków Against the Olympic Committee. In Opole, the current councilor of the Greens, Beata Kubica (elected in 2010 from the SLD list) ran for the city council from the list of German Minorities. In the Lubuskie voivodeship, the Greens together with the Social Justice Movement, trade unions and civic movements, co-founded the Nowy Ład Committee in the elections to the regional council. The Greens also issued a dozen or so candidates in the One-National Electoral Circumscriptions in Poland.

As a result of the elections, the independent lists of the Green Party in Warsaw received 2.55% of votes to the city council. A similar result (2.48%) was received by the candidate for the mayor of the city, Joanna Erbel. The Wrocław Green list received 1.97% of the votes to the city council. In Kraków, the Kraków Against the Olympic Committee, co-created by the Greens, received 6.7% of the votes, which did not translate into mandates, with Tomasz Leśniak receiving 4.84% of the votes in the elections for the city president. The Electoral Committee New Deal, co-created by the Greens, received 0.62% of support in the elections to the Lubusz Regional Assembly (it was the 10th result from among 11 committees). No Green candidate for a councilor in the single-member district has obtained a seat.

=== Polish presidential election of 2015 ===
In the 2015 presidential election, the candidate for the party was the deputy Anna Grodzka, who, however, did not collect the required number of 100 000 signatures.

=== Polish parliamentary election of 2015 ===
Greens joined the Zjednoczona Lewica (United Left) electoral alliance for the 2015 parliamentary election in July 2015. In the election the alliance received 7.6% of the vote, below the 8% electoral threshold leaving the alliance with no parliamentary representation. It was officially dissolved in February 2016.

=== Polish local elections of 2018 ===
In the 2018 local elections, the Greens, without any electoral alliance, managed to obtain the highest ever result in their party history of 1.15% of the votes, with their highest result as a percentage in Lubusz voivodeship (2.62%), and the highest local Gmina result being in Gmina Żary (10.0%).

This concludes that the Greens achieved better overall results in Western Poland areas which are near to the borders of Germany.

=== Sejm and European Parliament elections of 2019 ===
On 6 November 2018, at a press conference, the Greens officially announced preparations for the 2019 elections both at the national and European level. Announced at the end of July 2019, the party will participate in the 2019 Polish parliamentary election as part of the Civic Coalition.

== Principles and policies ==
The framework for Green policies, called &quot;The Green Manifesto&quot;, was adopted by the founding congress of the party on 6 and 7 September 2003. The Green Manifesto outlined the principles of green politics in seven areas: social justice and solidarity, civil society and reclaiming the state for citizens, environmental protection and sustainable development, gender equality, respect for national, cultural and religious diversity, protecting minority rights, and non-violent conflict resolution.

At the 4th Congress in April 2011, the Greens 2004 adopted elaborated policy documents concerning the principles of social policy, education policy, and health care policy.

<doc id="762913" wikidata="Q1062810" url="?curid=762913" title="Chaps">
<text>Chaparreras or Chaps () are a type of sturdy over-pants (overalls) or leggings of Mexican origin, made of leather, without a seat, made up of two separate legs that are fastened to the waist with straps or belt. They are worn over trousers and were originally intended for protecting the rider from the rain and mud, and from tears and injuries. They were created to replace &quot;Armas de Agua&quot; (Water shields) or simply &quot;Armas&quot; (Shields), a set of leather flaps that hung from the Mexican saddle to protect the rider&#x27;s legs from the rain. The word &quot;chaparreras&quot; is believed to have come from either “chaparrón”, a cloudburst or sudden, heavy rain, or from “chaparros” a Mexican colloquial name for brush, and a type of shrub. Due to the difficult pronunciation, Americans shortened the word to &quot;Chaps&quot;, originally spelled and pronounced &quot;schaps&quot; or &quot;shaps&quot;. &quot;Chivarras&quot;, from &quot;chivo&quot; (goat), is the name for Chaparreras made of goatskins tanned with the hair on.

There were other similar garments worn by the Mexican riders, including, &quot;Botas Huastecas&quot;, a set of wide leggings of pre-Hispanic origin used in the lowlands along the Gulf of Mexico; &quot;Mitazas&quot;, leggings similar to Chaparreras but that were not attached to the waist, only reaching up to the thigh; and &quot;Cuadrilera&quot; a small apron that predates Chaparreras made of leather that only covered the hip and part of the thigh used for roping.

In the modern world, they are worn for both practical work purposes and for exhibition or show use. Chaparreras or &quot;Chaps&quot; have also been adopted for use on motorcycles, particularly by cruiser-style motorcycle riders. 

==Etymology==
The most accepted etymology of “chaparreras&quot; is that it comes from &quot;chaparros&quot; a Mexican colloquial generic name for brush, and a specific type of shrub, &quot;chaparral&quot; (thick, thorny, low brush), from which it’s believed they were designed to protect the legs while riding on horseback. Another, equally plausible etymology is that it comes from &quot;chaparrón&quot;, which means cloudburst or downpour, a heavy rain, itself from the onomatopoeic &quot;chap&quot; which is the sound of rain hitting the ground. In most 19th century texts, chaparreras are described as trousers worn to protect the pants underneath from the rain and mud. Due to the difficult pronunciation, Americans shortened the word to &quot;Chaps&quot;, originally spelled and pronounced &quot;Shaps&quot;. By 1884, the Dictionary of American Regional English notes use of the word in Wyoming, spelled &quot;schaps&quot;. &quot;Chaparejos&quot;, misspelled by Americans as &quot;chaparajos&quot;, is a blend of the words &quot;chaparreras&quot; and &quot;aparejo&quot; (rig or equipment for horseback riding).

==History==

The precise history of Chaparreras is uncertain. They appeared on the scene in Mexico between the late 1830s and early 1840s. The first mention of them that historians have been able to find is from 1843. Before this, there is no evidence of their existence, as they were absent from writings and paintings from that time. Before the appearance of Chaparreras, the Mexican horsemen used a set of leather flaps called &quot;Armas&quot; or &quot;Armas de Agua&quot; that hung from the pommel of their saddles. These &quot;armas&quot; or “shields” were used to protect the riders pants and boots from the rain, hence their name “Armas de Agua” or “water shields”. Armas also have a recent history as there is no evidence of their existence prior to the 19th century, neither in writings nor in paintings.

The first documented evidence of Chaparreras is in an 1843 article titled —“Cartas Sobre México: Alameda y Bucareli”— in the magazine “El Museo Mexicano” about life in the Mexico City promenade Alameda Central, although the writer doesn’t go into detail about them. It would be the following year 1844 in the article —“Costumbres y Trajes Nacionales: Los Rancheros”— about the life and customs of Mexican Rancheros, that readers would get a description. The writer, Don Domingo Revilla, states that Chaparreras are “in vogue everywhere” in Mexico implying that they were something recent and new. Revilla describes Chaparreras as “trousers with buttons on the sides and no seat” and goes on to say that they are “widely used in El Jaral and in Tierra-Adentro” referring to the great hacienda “El Jaral de Berrio” in Guanajuato and “Tierra-Adentro” or hinterland. One popular song from that time tells that people go to “El Jaral” to buy chaparrreras. El Jaral de Berrio, known for their fine leather production, might be a possible place of origin of Chaparreras. 

The first Chaparreras were actually pants made out of leather with no seat and with buttons on the sides, as Revilla described, that was worn over the riders’ cloth or suede pants to protect them from the rain and mud. Don Carlos Rincón Gallardo states that those early Chaparreras were distinct from the most recent ones (20th century) in that they were never unbuttoned, so that, to put them on, the rider had to remove his shoes and place one leg into each pant-leg one at a time like any other pants. These first Chaparreras were in disuse in Mexico by the early 20th century being replaced by a new model that remains the standard today, two separate leather pant-legs that are united at the top by a strap or clasp that serves as a belt, with buttons or laces on the side that could be undone making it possible to wear them without having to take your boots off 

One common belief today is that chaparreras derived from Spanish &quot;zahones&quot;, a leather apron used by shepherds, hunters, workers, herdsmen and others, to protect the front of pants from tears. But there is no evidence to support this. Zahones are not and have never been trousers like chaparreras but rather aprons, known in Spanish as &quot;delantal&quot; or &quot;delantera&quot;, two pieces of leather or cloth that only protect the front of each leg and are tied around the waist. Prior to the 20th century, zahones were shorter only covering the front of the thigh down to the knees. In all 19th century Spanish dictionaries, zahones are defined as either leather or cloth aprons or short opened breeches that are tied around the waist and behind each thigh covering the front down to the knees or never going beyond the calves. Zahones, of Arabic origin, are also older than chaparreras dating back to at least the 16th century and were originally gregüescos (zaragüelles), very distinct from the styles of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Chaparreras, on the contrary, are not aprons but trousers that cover the entire leg, front and back, and were originally intended to protect the rider&#x27;s pants from the rain and, unlike zahones, were introduced in the 19th century and have no known connection to gregüescos. In Mexico, no mention of anything resembling zahones has been found in any text (or painting) from the 19th century or earlier and in all descriptions of chaparreras made by foreigners they never compared or linked them to zahones. In the accounts of Spanish travelers who described chaparreras, they never mentioned any similarity with zahones or inferred that they were derived from them and never indicated that it was a known garment in Spain; on the contrary, they always implied that chaparreras were something unknown or “exotic” to them. The Spanish writer and poet, Juan Martínez Villergas, who visited Mexico in the 1850’s, found Chaparreras to be interesting or amusing, suggesting they were unknown to him as a Spaniard, and criticized the opulence, stating:


Likewise, the Spanish journalist and historian, Niceto de Zamacois, never mentioned Chaparreras as being derived from Spanish zahones nor did he claim they were similar to them when he described them to Spanish readers, implying that they were unknown in Spain, stating: 

One possible origin of Chaparreras might be the pre-Hispanic “calzas” or leggings used by the indigenous people of Mexico. Leather leggings, called calzas by the Spanish, made out of deerskin or wild dog, were part of the traditional outfit of the Chichimecas of Central Mexico. &quot;Botas Huastecas&quot;, wide leather leggings or pants that were attached around the waist and were used by the herdsmen of Veracruz might also be a possible origin, as they were similar to and predated chaparreras. The name “Huastecas”, referring to the Huastec people and the peculiar way of manufacture by tanning deerskins with rotten brains and smoking them with burnt corncobs to generate a pungent smell to repel bugs and other critters, indicates an indigenous origin. “Mitazas”, a set of leggings similar to chaparreras but that were not attached at the waist, only reaching up and attaching to each thigh, are also credited to indigenous leggings.

There is also evidence in the United States that certain design features may derive from the mountain men, who copied them from the leggings worn by Native Americans. According to David Hackett Fischer (1989), the leather bottoms worn among frontiersmen had Scotch-Irish and Northern English predecessors, giving 18th century records of sheepskin leggings in Westmorland and gaiters known as &quot;leather stockings&quot; in Carlisle as evidence. Different styles developed to fit local climate, terrain and hazards. Designs were also modified for purely stylistic and decorative purposes. The time of actual appearance of the garment on American cowboys is uncertain. By the late 1870s, however, most Texas cowboys wore them as the cattle industry moved north.

The first chaparreras were made out of cowhide and goatskin tanned with the hair on, the latter being the most sought after because the hair repels water better. These chaparreras made of goatskins are called &quot;chivarras&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;chivo&quot; (goat) and chaparreras. The more expensive ones were made out of leopard skin, bear and otter fur. Many were embossed with intricate designs and patterns and richly decorated with gold and silver buttons, brooches and buckles.

===Armas===

The &quot;Armas de Agua&quot; (Water Shields), &quot;Armas de Pelo&quot; (Hairy Shields), or simply &quot;Armas&quot; (Shields), are two large leather flaps, commonly goat, deer or calf skin, sometimes embossed, that are attached to and hung from the pommel, on both sides, of the Mexican saddles to cover and protect, from the rain, the Calzoneras (trousers), legs and feet of the Charro. When they are being used, they each are pulled over the legs and feet, and are tied behind the waist. When they are not, they remain hanging on each side of the saddle, just in front of the rider’s legs. When the Charro camped outside, they could be removed from the saddle and be used as a sleeping mat and blanket. Some of the more expensive kind were richly decorated, made of “tiger” (leopard), puma, bear or otter fur. &quot;Armas&quot;, like most of the equipment of the Charro, arose in Central Mexico and later, through migration and necessity, they passed on to the rest of the country, to north and south.

Armas, like chaparreras, are also absent from texts and paintings from before the 19th century. Some people have also argued that armas originated in Spain and were brought to Mexico by the Spaniards. But, just like chaparreras, there is no evidence of their existence in Spain, and those Spaniards that described armas to a Spanish audience found them strange and, in some cases, described them as simple “trifles”, indicating they were unknown in their country. Spanish lawyer and monarchist, Luis Manuel del Rivero, not only derided the Mexican vaquero saddle and armas as “grotesque” but also never mentioned chaparreras as part of the Ranchero attire, which would show that they were either not common or didn&#x27;t exist yet around the time he visited Mexico (1842): “The Ranchero is a man of higher thoughts, very strong, great horseman, […] His attire, boots made of leather with which the leg is wrapped several times; spurs, as I have said, colossal; wide leather or cloth pants over cloth underwear; cotton shirt; a sash with which the waist is secured; a cotona, that is, a short leather jacket that is worn over the head, and a very large and heavy chambergo or Jarano hat. For overdress, a Manga or Serape. His horse&#x27;s trappings are no less grotesque, since the Vaquero saddle with its large stirrups and flaps, especially if it is complemented by an anquera, Armas de Agua, and other trifles, is a world in the midst of which the Ranchero finds himself in his world, and he believes himself superior to all the powerful men of the earth, executing extremely difficult spins and movements.” 

&quot;Armas&quot; began to be replaced by chaparreras around the 1840s, although they didn&#x27;t provide all the services and protection that the Armas did, since they cannot be used as a sleeping mat nor protect the foot. Today Armas continue to exist and are still used in certain regions of the country both for work, as in Baja California Sur, and for ceremonial or ornamental purposes in Central and Southern Mexico.

===Mitazas===

Mitazas are similar to chaparreras, except they only go up to the thigh. The first ones were fastened at the thigh but later ones were fastened at the sides with small buckles. These Mitazas that reached up to the thigh are no longer in use. Today, what people refer to as “mitazas” are more like half-chaps, only covering the calves.

According to Mexican writer and journalist Manuel Payno, mitazas were more common in the northern areas of Mexico:

===Botas Huastecas===
In the lowlands of Veracruz, the country horsemen that worked in the haciendas of the state were called Jarochos, specifically those dedicated to the job of vaquero (cowherd) and everything related to cattle ranching. Their customs, traditions and costume were very distinct from the herdsmen of the highlands, the Rancheros. They didn&#x27;t wear any type of footwear, riding their horses barefooted. When they were herding cattle out in the woods and mountains, their only protection on their legs was a pair of leggings called “Botas Huastecas” (Huastec Boots), a kind of wide leggings or breeches that were fastened at the waist, similar to chaparreras, made of deer-skin tanned with putrefied brains and smoked with corn cobs, to protect them from thorns and snakes, and repel chiggers, ticks and other bugs with the putrid smell.

The manufacturing process for making &quot;Botas Huastecas&quot; consisted, according to an article published in 1869, in: 

Botas Huastecas no longer exist since at least the late 19th century.

===Cuadrilera or Rozadera===
Cuadrilera also known as Rozadera, is a piece of leather in the form of an apron, that only covers part of the hip and thigh, and has four straps, two that attach to the waist and the other two are fasten around the thigh. It is made of cowhide or suede, and were used for roping, prior to the existence of Chaparreras, and used today when chaparreras are not worn, to protect the pants and legs from the chafing of the rope. It goes on the right leg for roping on horseback, and on the left when roping on foot. Cuadrileras can be used together with Chaparreras by wearing it underneath to provide extra protection when doing more heavy roping. Most Chaparreras today come with built in rozaderas.

The Cuadrilera also functions as a cover to protect the saddle seat from wear and tear and to prevent it from getting hot by attaching it on the front of the saddle; if there is a need to dismount, leaving the saddled horse in the sun, the charro can lift the cuadrilera like a lid over the saddle horn and when he remounts he can put it back in its place. The cuadrilera is the most traditional and Charro way to protect the saddle seat.

==American style Chaps==
Shotgun chaps, sometimes called &quot;stovepipes&quot;, were so named because the legs are straight and narrow. They were the earliest design used by Texas cowboys, in wide use by the late 1870s. Each leg is cut from a single piece of leather. Their fit is snug, wrapping completely around the leg. Modern versions may have full-length zippers running along the outside of the leg from the thigh to just above the ankle. The edge of each legging is usually fringed and the bottom is sometimes cut with an arch or flare that allows a smooth fit over the arch of a boot. Shotguns do not flap around the way the batwing design can, and they are also better at trapping body heat, an advantage in windy, snowy or cold conditions, though unpleasant in very hot or humid weather. Shotgun chaps are more common on ranches in the northwest, Rocky Mountains and northern plains states, as well as Canada, and are the design most commonly seen in horse show competition for western riders, especially western equitation. English riders who wear full-length chaps also usually wear a shotgun style, sometimes without fringe.


Batwing chaps are cut wide with a flare at the bottom. Generally made of smooth leather, they have only two or three fasteners around the thigh, thus allowing great freedom of movement for the lower leg. This is helpful when riding very actively, and makes it easier to mount the horse. This design also provides more air circulation and is thus somewhat cooler for hot-weather wear. Batwing chaps are often seen on rodeo contestants, particularly those who ride bucking stock. They are also seen on working ranches, particularly in Texas. They were a later design, developed after the end of the open range. Although by definition the chaps that rodeo contestants wear are considered batwing chaps, contestants do not refer to them as batwings. They are simply called rodeo chaps. There are a few differences in design between working ranch batwing chaps and rodeo chaps. Rodeo chaps are usually more colorful and decorated, whereas ranch cowboys need toughness over style. Rodeo chaps have long flowing fringe which can be the same or a different color as the main body.

Chinks are half-length chaps that stop two to four inches (5 to 10 cm) below the knee, with very long fringe at the bottom and along the sides. They are usually fringed along the outside edge and bottom, making their apparent length appear about 4 inches (10 cm) longer. The leg shape is cut somewhere between batwings and shotguns, and each leg usually has only two fasteners, high on the thigh. They are cooler to wear and hence a design that is suitable for very warm climates. They are occasionally called &quot;half-chaps&quot; (not to be confused with gaiters-style half chaps described &quot;below&quot;). The original etymon may have been or , and may have originally referred to . Chinks are most often seen on cowboys in the Southwestern and Pacific states, most notably on those who follow the California or &quot;buckaroo&quot; tradition.

 believed to be an early style of chaps, supposedly developed by the Spanish in colonial Mexico and became associated with the &quot;buckaroos&quot; or vaqueros of the Great Basin area of what is now the United States, although there is no evidence of these and other types of chaparreras in Colonial Mexico. They are a short legging with completely closed legs that have to be put on in a manner similar to pants. They are sometimes a bit longer than chinks, but still stopping above the top of the boot, fringed on the sides and on the bottom to reach the boot tops, attached by a fringed belt.

A farrier&#x27;s apron is a specialized style of chinks without fringe, also known as horse shoeing chaps. They protect the upper legs of farriers from getting scratched or cut up in the process of shoeing or otherwise treating the hooves of horses. Some designs have a breakaway front for safety while working. Farrier&#x27;s aprons are also sometimes used by ranch hands when stacking hay to reduce wear on clothing.
Woolies are a variation on shotgun chaps, made with a fleece or with hair-on cowhide, often angora, lined with canvas on the inside. They are the warmest chaps, associated with the northern plains and Rocky Mountains. They appeared on the Great Plains somewhere around 1887.

==South American==

 somewhat resemble batwing chaps, in that the leggings are closely fitted at the thigh and flare out below the knee, but unlike batwings, the leggings extend far below the boot with a distinctive triangular flare. or Zamarra, from the Basque language meaning &quot;sheep fleece&quot;, was originally applied back in Spain to the wool coats and vests used by Spanish shepherds in the mountains of the Basque country. The term was introduced to the Americas with that definition, but around the 1840&#x27;s (no mention of them before) the term was applied to the leggings made of wool or llama used by some horsemen in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, and were originally intended, just like Mexican chaparreras, to protect the rider from the rain.

Modern are commonly made of cowhide, either plain tanned leather or hides with the hair on. They are popular with Paso Fino aficionados, and are derived from styles seen in Colombia. Historically, the word simply referred to a basic shotgun-like style of either smooth or hair-on chaps worn by Colombian riders.

===Iberian Zahones===

Zahones, from the Arabic &quot;safn&quot; or &quot;sufun&quot; meaning apron or tablecloth, are aprons, not trousers, made of leather, that cover just the front of the legs to protect it from scratches. Before the 20th century, zahones were a lot shorter only covering the frontal area of the thighs down to the knees. They are distinct from chaparreras.

According to Sebastián de Covarrubias, zahón and its variants zafón, safón or çahon, of Arabic origin, is a “wide, legging (...) or calzón or gregüesco ..&quot; The Arabic origin of the word is confirmed by Joan Coromines when citing the Portuguese word &quot;açafôes.&quot; The Arabic etymology of the word zahón or zafón could be “safn” or “sufun”, which designates a “leather tablecloth and apron.“ In Spanish, apron (mandil) and tablecloth (mantel) have the same etymology. The first Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language (1726-1739) defines Zahón as : &quot;A type of wide breeches, also called zafón. In some parts, it only corresponds to the front, for riding a horse.&quot; Leopoldo Eguílaz defines it as: &quot;Breeches open on both sides, that do not go beyond the calf, made of sheepskin, cowhide, deerskin.&quot; Luis Marty Caballero defines it as: &quot;A kind of leather apron tied at the waist and on each of the thighs.
Zahones worn by campinos in Portugal during the 1950s were sheepskin or goatskin with the wool or hair on and of a &quot;drainpipe&quot; style, while in Spain, zahones were without hair and feature intricately worked designs called &quot;poker-work.&quot; In Spain today, rejoneadores wear smooth zahones attached with a single strap behind the knee. They are also worn in monterías, either in their leather or Grazalema variations.

===Uses===
Chaps are intended to protect the legs of cowboys from contact with daily environmental hazards seen in working with cattle, horses and other livestock. They help to protect riders&#x27; legs from scraping on brush, injury from thorns of cacti, sagebrush, mesquite and other thorny vegetation. Chaps are also useful for other types of riding. Leather chaps stick to a leather saddle or a bareback horse better than do fabric trousers and thus help the rider stay on. They are worn by rodeo competitors in &quot;rough stock&quot; events, including bull riding, saddle bronc and bareback riding. Riders in other disciplines, including various styles of English riding, sometimes wear chaps while schooling horses.

Chaps are commonly worn by western riders at horse shows, where contestants are required to adhere to traditional forms of clothing, albeit with more decorative touches than seen in working designs. Currently chaps are also worn as a fashion choice for equestrian training and clinics. Chaps may now include contrast seams, elastic for better fit and crystal detailing. Chaps are often required by show rules, and even when optional under the rules are often worn to give a &quot;finished&quot; look to an outfit. Fashions change periodically and styles vary between the assorted sub-disciplines within western-style riding

==Non-equestrian chaps==
Chainsaw chaps are a component of chainsaw safety clothing. They are made of strong materials like kevlar and protect the legs from injury. A similar style, though of different materials, is sold to hunters and other outdoor sportsmen for protection from rattlesnake bites. Outside of snake country, bird hunters often wear &quot;upland chaps&quot; made of waxed cotton or nylon to protect their legs from briars and thorns. Use of upland chaps allows any type of pants to be worn in the field and they are also used to protect rain suits.

Motorcycle chaps are a type of motorcycle safety clothing and are an example of the shotgun style. They are usually made of leather with the smooth side out, and generally provide all-around protection for the leg and have side zippers to allow them to be put on easily. They are popular in the biker subculture, providing protection from the wind and cold as well as partial protection from cuts and scrapes in the event of a fall to the roadway.

Chaps are also popular in fetish fashion and the leather subculture, where they often are tightly fitted and worn without jeans or other garments layered beneath them other than a codpiece. They can be made of leather, patent leather, rubber, or vinyl and are worn for decoration serving no protective purpose. Worn in this manner, they are colloquially referred to as &quot;assless&quot; chaps, despite the redundancy of the term (all chaps are &quot;assless&quot;; chaps with a seat would be called trousers). More often, this style of chaps are referred to as &quot;bar&quot; chaps.

==Materials and construction==

Equestrian chaps, with the exception of woolies, are traditionally made of cowhide. Woolies, some Zamorros, and a few other historic or ethnic styles may be made with the hair or wool still on the hide, usually cowhide, sheepskin, or Angora goat skin. Historically, they also included seal, bear, and buffalo.

Leather for chaps is tanned and dyed, and the hide is usually &quot;split&quot; so that the leather is supple and can be made into a garment that allows easy movement. There is a rough side, what is today called suede or &quot;roughout&quot;, and a smooth side. Chaps are made in both &quot;roughout&quot; and &quot;smooth out&quot; (smooth side out) designs. Most batwings and chinks are made smooth side out, most shotguns are suede, or roughout. For horse shows, where fashions may change from year to year and durability is not as great a concern, lighter, synthetic materials such as ultrasuede and vinyl may be used, though leather suede or a smooth split predominates due to durability and proper fit. In Australia, chaps may be made of oilskin rather than leather.

Most chaps, with the exception of Armitas (which have no metal parts), usually have a small metal buckle in front to attach around the waist, and have lacing on the back of the belt area to allow adjustment in size. A few designs lace in the front and buckle in the back, but they are not often seen. The sides of some designs, particularly the batwing style, either have straps and relatively small metal buckles or snaps to attach the legging around the rider&#x27;s leg. Other styles, particularly shotguns, usually use full-length heavy-duty metal zippers. Some historic styles of riding chaps used a single break-away leather string or lace instead of a front buckle. The original purpose was to break away if a rider&#x27;s chaps&#x27; belt somehow became hooked over the saddle horn.

Except for the batwing design, most chaps are fringed along the edge of the leg, usually a fringe of the same leather as the legging, though occasionally a contrasting color of leather may be added. Chinks and Armitas have fringe on the bottom of the leg as well. The belt that holds on a pair of the chaps may be the same color of leather or of a contrasting color, sometimes is fringed in the back for show, but usually not on a working outfit. Decorative leather designs or fancy stitching may be added along the edge of bottom of the leg or to the belt, and even sterling silver pieces may be used for buckles, and on round decorative metal conchos placed to cover the lacing on the back of the belt, or occasionally even at the bottom of the legging, by the heel.

==Half chaps==
Half chaps, also known as chapettes, are a popular style of equestrian gaiters that extend from the ankle to just below the knee. When worn over a short paddock boot they give the protection and some of the appearance of a tall riding boot, but at lower cost. They are widely worn by children in horse shows and by trail riders. Half chaps usually are made of leather, and have a zipper or hook and loop closure on the outside. They provide grip for the rider, and protection from sweat and the stirrup leather. They are commonly used over the paddock boots of English-style riders in place of tall boots. While not true chaps, some Western-style riders use half chaps, particularly in hot weather, but gaiter-style half chaps are not traditional cowboy gear.

==Fitting==
Chaps are usually worn over denim jeans or other trousers of heavy material. They have their own belt, and usually are fitted around the hips, resting below the belt loops of the trousers. Except for chinks and , which are designed to fit above the boot, most chaps are long, fitting over the boot and draping slightly over the vamp of the boot (see shoe). Some designs are cut to hang long at the heel and nearly cover the entire boot except for the toe. Batwings, chinks, and shotgun chaps fit firmly but comfortably around the thigh, with shotguns continuing to fit closely all the way down the calf, though not so snug as to limit free knee movement. The shotgun design is a bit flared at the ankle to allow for the rider&#x27;s boot. Batwings and chinks are not attached around the leg below the knee.

<text>The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday (often abbreviated as TMWSIY) is a 1988 concept album written by Trey Anastasio, the guitarist and lead vocalist of the American rock band Phish, as his senior thesis while attending Goddard College. Completed in July 1988, the thesis included an essay piece and collection of songs (recorded by Phish) relating an epic tale from the band&#x27;s fictional land of Gamehendge.

==Background and concept==
On the album, the story of Gamehendge is told in nine parts, with short spoken narration in between. The saga can be compared to rock concept album projects like The Doors&#x27; &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; or Rush&#x27;s &quot;2112&quot; suite.

The story&#x27;s primary protagonist is Colonel Forbin. Other major characters include Tela, the &quot;jewel of Wilson&#x27;s foul domain&quot; and the &quot;evil&quot; Wilson himself. Several of the album&#x27;s spoken narrative sections are accompanied by background music borrowed from sections of the Phish songs &quot;Esther&quot; and &quot;McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters&quot;. The final track, &quot;Possum&quot;, is the only song on the album not written by Anastasio, having been written by former Phish member Jeff Holdsworth and later added to the Gamehendge cycle.

Many of the album&#x27;s tracks have long been included in Phish&#x27;s regular song rotation and played during the band&#x27;s live performances. In addition, various versions of the entire Gamehendge saga have been performed, complete with narration, on five occasions in the band&#x27;s history, usually as the entire first set of a live show. Many other Phish songs also relate in some way to the Gamehendge saga, and appear on later albums and in live performances, including &quot;Llama&quot;, &quot;Punch You in the Eye&quot; and &quot;The Divided Sky&quot;.

The Mockingbird Foundation, a charity founded by Phish fans to fund music education, is named for the &quot;famous mockingbird&quot; in the saga.

==Official releases==
Though the album was recorded, it has never been released officially. Phish circulated the studio recording of the suite in 1987 and 1988 and it quickly became a collector&#x27;s item. At one time Anastasio announced plans in &quot;Doniac Schvice&quot;, Phish&#x27;s newsletter, to release the material as an interactive CD-ROM. However, this never happened and the album can only be found in bootleg or in fan-traded form.

The only officially released version of the Gamehendge suite is as part of the band&#x27;s July 8, 1994 concert, which was released in August 2020. This version of the suite does not include &quot;Possum&quot;, but features &quot;Llama&quot;, &quot;McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters&quot; and &quot;Divided Sky&quot;, all of which are connected to the Gamehendge mythology or the story of Colonel Forbin, as well as &quot;NO2&quot;, an experimental instrumental that was the B-side to the &quot;Down with Disease&quot; single and is used during the performance to soundtrack Anastasio&#x27;s introductory narrative.

On December 31, 2023, Phish performed their annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show at Madison Square Garden, playing music from &quot;The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday&quot; with live actors, including Annie Golden, who played the part of the grandmother of Jimmy from &quot;Harpua&quot;.

<doc id="762919" wikidata="Q247318" url="?curid=762919" title="Records of the Three Kingdoms">
<text>The Records of the Three Kingdoms is a Chinese official history written by Chen Shou in the late 3rd century CE, covering the end of the Han dynasty (220 CE) and the subsequent Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE). It is regarded as to be the authoritative source text for these periods. Compiled following the reunification of China under the Jin dynasty (266–420), the work chronicles the political, social, and military events within rival states Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu into a single text organized by individual biography.

The &quot;Records&quot; are the primary source of information for the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, considered to be one of the four classic novels emblematic of written vernacular Chinese.

While large subsections of the work have been selected and translated into English, the entire corpus has yet to receive an unabridged English translation.

==Origin and structure==
The &quot;Book of Han&quot; and &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; join the original Han-era universal history &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; to constitute the first three entries in the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; canon, with each work cementing the new genre&#x27;s literary and historiographical qualities as established by Sima Qian. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; consist of 65 fascicles divided into three books—one per eponymous kingdom—totaling around 360,000 Chinese characters in length. The &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, &quot;Book of Shu&quot;, and &quot;Book of Wu&quot; receive 30 fascicles, 15 fascicles, and 20 fascicles respectively. Each fascicle is organised in the form of one or more biographies.

The author Chen Shou was born in present-day Nanchong, Sichuan, then in the state of Shu Han. After the Conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, he became an official historian under the government of the Jin dynasty, and created a history of the Three Kingdoms period. After the Conquest of Wu by Jin in 280, his work received the acclaim of senior minister Zhang Hua.

Prior to the Jin dynasty, both the states of Cao Wei and Wu has already composed their own official histories: the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; by Wang Chen, Xun Yi, and Ruan Ji; and the &quot;Book of Wu&quot; by Wei Zhao, Hua He, Xue Ying, Zhou Zhao (), and Liang Guang (). Additionally, Yu Huan had completed his privately compiled history of Wei, the &quot;Weilüe&quot;. Chen Shou used these texts as the foundation of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. However, since the state of Shu lacked an official history bureau, the &quot;Book of Shu&quot; in the &quot;Records&quot; was composed by Chen Shou himself based on his earlier personal notes about events in Shu and other primary sources he collected, such as his previously compiled writings of Zhuge Liang.

The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; used the year 220 CE—when the last emperor of the Han dynasty was forced to abdicate to Cao Pi—as the year in which the Wei dynasty was established. The &quot;Records&quot; refer to the rulers of Wei as &#x27;Emperors&#x27; and those of Shu and Wu as &#x27;Lords&#x27; or by their personal names.

==Dates==
Due to the biographical rather than primarily annalistic arrangement of the work, assigning dates to the historical content is both imprecise and non-trivial. Certain fascicles contain background information about their subjects&#x27; forebears which date back centuries before the main record. For example, the biography of Liu Yan begins with discussing his ancestor Liu Yu&#x27;s enfeoffment at Jingling (present-day Tianmen, Hubei) in around 85 CE. The first event to receive detailed description throughout the work is the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184. Many biographies make passing mention of the event, but more concrete information such as correspondence and troop movements during the uprising can be found in fragmentary form in at least four fascicles: the biographies of Cheng Yu, Yu Jin, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian.

The three books in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; end at different dates, with the main section of the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; ending with the abdication of Cao Huan in February 266, the &quot;Book of Shu&quot; ending with the death of Liu Shan in 271, and the &quot;Book of Wu&quot; ending with the death of Sun Hao in 284.

One abstract regarding the chronology is translated as follows: 

==Contents==

===&quot;Book of Wei&quot; (魏書)===
===&quot;Book of Shu&quot; (蜀書)===
===&quot;Book of Wu&quot; (吳書)===
==Annotations==
During the fifth century, the Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi (372–451) extensively annotated Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; using a variety of other sources, augmenting the text to twice the length of the original. This work, completed in 429, became one of the official histories of the Three Kingdoms period, under the title &quot;Sanguozhi zhu&quot; (三国志注 &quot;zhu&quot; meaning &quot;notes&quot;). Bibliographical records indicate that up until Pei&#x27;s own Liu Song dynasty, Chen Shou&#x27;s three books had circulated individually rather than as a single work.

Pei collected other records to add information he felt should be added. He provided detailed explanations to some of the geography and other elements mentioned in the original. He also included multiple accounts of the same events. Sometimes, the accounts he added contradicted each other, but he included them anyway since he could not decide which version was the correct one. If Pei added something that sounded wrong, he would make a note or even offer a correction. In regard to historical events and figures, as well as Chen Shou&#x27;s original text, he added his own commentary. Crucially, he cited his sources in almost every case.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; was the main source of inspiration for the 14th century &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, one of the four great Classic Chinese Novels. As such the records is considered one of the most influential historical and cultural texts in Chinese history. In addition, the records provide one of the earliest accounts of Korea and Japan. Chen&#x27;s &quot;Records&quot; set the standard for how Korea and Japan would write their official histories as well.

=== Influence on Asia ===
Chen&#x27;s &quot;Records&quot; is the chronologically final text of the &quot;Four Histories&quot; (), which together influenced and served as a model for Korean and Japanese official histories.

The &quot;Records&quot; are important to the research of early Korean ( &quot;Samguk ji&quot;) and Japanese history (三国志 Sangokushi). It provides, among other things, the first detailed account of Korean and Japanese societies such as Goguryeo, Yemaek and Wa. The passages in Fascicle 30 about the Wa, where the Yamatai-koku and its ruler Queen Himiko are recorded, are referred to as the &quot;Wajinden&quot; in Japanese studies. The Japanese did not have their own records until more than three centuries later, with the earliest extant native record being the &quot;Kojiki&quot; of 712.

=== &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ===
The text forms the foundation on which the 14th-century novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong is based. In addition, Chen Shou&#x27;s literary style and vivid portrayal of characters have been a source of influence for the novel.

The &quot;Records&quot; include biographies of historical figures such as Cao Cao and Guan Yu who feature prominently in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, though the &quot;Romance&quot; also includes a number of characters and stories that are fictional. However, most of the historical facts were drawn from Chen&#x27;s &quot;Records&quot;.

==Translations==
The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; has not been fully translated into English. William Gordon Crowell alludes to a project to translate Chen Shou&#x27;s work with Pei Songzhi&#x27;s commentary in full, but it was apparently discontinued. Parts of that project are published by Robert Joe Cutter and William Gordon Crowell under the title &quot;Empresses and Consorts: Selections from Chen Shou&#x27;s Records of the Three States With Pei Songzhi&#x27;s Commentary&quot; (University of Hawaii Press, 1999), which includes the translations for fascicles 5, 34, and 50.

Other translations include Kenneth J. Dewoskin&#x27;s &quot;Doctors Diviners and Magicians of Ancient China: Biographies of Fang-Shih&quot; (Columbia University Press, 1983), which includes a full translation of fascicle 29. Rafe de Crespigny, in addition to his translation of Sun Jian&#x27;s biography (Fascicle 46), also translated excerpts of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; in his translation of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; that deals with the last years of the Han dynasty, as does Achilles Fang, who translated the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; fascicles that deal with the Three Kingdoms period proper. The &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; fascicles in question draw heavily from &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Further excerpts of the &quot;Records&quot; can be found in various sourcebooks dealing with East Asian history.

<text>In computer programming, an aspect of a program is a feature linked to many other parts of the program, but is not related to the program&#x27;s primary function. An aspect crosscuts the program&#x27;s core concerns, therefore violating its separation of concerns that tries to encapsulate unrelated functions. For example, logging code can crosscut many modules, yet the aspect of logging should be separate from the functional concerns of the module it cross-cuts. Isolating such aspects as logging and persistence from business logic is at the core of the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm.

Aspect-orientation is not limited to programming since it is useful to identify, analyse, trace and modularise concerns through requirements elicitation, specification, and design. Aspects can be multi-dimensional by allowing both functional and non-functional behaviour to crosscut any other concerns, instead of just mapping non-functional concerns to functional requirements.

One view of aspect-oriented software development is that every major feature of the program, core concern (business logic), or cross-cutting concern (additional features), is an aspect, and by weaving them together (a process also called composition), one finally produces a whole out of the separate aspects. This approach is known as pure aspect programming, but hybrid approaches are more common. It is possible for functional concerns to crosscut non-functional or functional concerns (e.g., the need for more features harms mobility). A uniform approach to representation and composition, similar to the pure approach in AOP, is termed multidimensional representation.
