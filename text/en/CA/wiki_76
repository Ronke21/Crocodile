<text>Mount Pleasant is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., located in Northwest D.C. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with restaurants and stores centered along a commercial corridor on Mt. Pleasant Street. Mount Pleasant is known for its unique identity and multicultural landscape, home to diverse groups such as the punk rock, the Peace Corps and Hispanic Washingtonian communities.

The neighborhood was initially developed around the Mount Pleasant Hospital, which was built and operated during the American Civil War. Following the war, the largely rural was subdivided for real estate development. Following the advent of the D.C. streetcar system, Mt. Pleasant became Washington&#x27;s first streetcar suburb and burgeoned as an affluent residential area until the mid-1940s. The neighborhood entered a period of decay following the white flight and the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots. Since the 2000s, Mount Pleasant has undergone increasing urban redevelopment and levels of gentrification.

==History==
=== 18th century ===
In 1727, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, then governor of the Province of Maryland, awarded a land grant for present-day Mount Pleasant to James Holmead. This estate, later named &quot;Pleasant Plains&quot;, included the territory of present-day neighborhoods of Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Meridian Hill, and Pleasant Plains (which only covers a portion of the original estate of the same name).

After the creation of the District of Columbia in 1791, Pleasant Plains estate became part of Washington County, but not part of the City of Washington.

In 1794 and 1796, noted Georgetown businessman Robert Peter conducted the first land surveys in the area and created maps for tracts of some of his land in Mount Pleasant for transactions with commissioners of the city.

=== 19th century ===

In 1861, William Selden, former Treasurer of the United States, owned of land north of Pierce Mill Road, but having been a Confederate sympathizer, was forced was forced to sell his land at a low price and move back to Virginia. The purchaser was New England native Samuel P. Brown, who built a house and also allowed the Mount Pleasant General Hospital to be constructed on his land.

After the American Civil War, Brown began selling his land in parcels. He named the area &quot;Mount Pleasant Village&quot; because it contained the land having the highest elevation within the original Pleasant Plains estate. Brown sold all of his land except for the parcel he retained around his house at 3351 Mount Pleasant Street, NW.

In the 1870s, a horse-drawn streetcar began traveling between the Fourteenth and Park intersection to downtown Washington city, making this the first streetcar suburb in the District of Columbia. In 1878, Mount Pleasant merged into Washington when the city&#x27;s boundaries became with those of the District.

=== 20th century ===

In 1901, 16th Street NW was extended north of Florida Avenue, establishing the boundary of the neighborhood. Mount Pleasant developed rapidly as a streetcar suburb after the expansion of the mechanized Washington streetcars along 16 1/2 Street (now Mount Pleasant Street) in 1903. In 1907, developer Fulton R. Gordon purchased large sections of the neighborhood, marketing lots as &quot;Mount Pleasant Heights&quot; with Robert E. Heater. Many houses and apartment buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1925, primarily marketed to middle- to upper middle class people.

In 1925, the city built the Mount Pleasant Library, designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and partially funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.

By 1927, all homeowners in the neighborhood had signed restrictive covenants forbidding sale to African Americans. By the time of World War II, many of the row houses were converted to boarding houses, many of which were occupied by single women.

The neighborhood changed after the 1948 decision by the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, which struck down the restrictive covenants. After a Black Howard University professor moved into a prestigious Park Road home in 1950, some white residents began to leave the neighborhood. This White flight increased after the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots and by 1970 the neighborhood was 65% black.

Beginning in the 1960s and increasing through the 1980s, immigrants from Central America, particularly from Intipucá, El Salvador, settled in the neighborhood. The new residents developed businesses catering to Hispanic and Latino Americans along commercial portions of Mount Pleasant Street. The neighborhood also attracted former Peace Corps workers.

In 1973, the Community of Christ, a lay-led Lutheran group dedicated to social justice, bought a large building on Mount Pleasant Street and made it available rent-free to peace activists, pro-immigrant groups and musicians. In the 1980s, the group house scene flourished.

However, from the 1970s to the 1990s, the neighborhood suffered from the crack epidemic and the illegal drug trade was rampant. 

In 1987, the neighborhood was designated as a historic district. The neighborhood was majority-minority in 1990, with African Americans making up 36% of the population, Latinos 26%, and whites 35%.

In May 1991, the Washington, D.C. riot of 1991 erupted following the shooting of Daniel Enrique Gómez by an MPD officer. The riot, which injured twelve people and destroyed several buildings in the neighborhood, was a pivotal moment in the emergence of Latino activism in DC. In response, MPD Chief Isaac Fulwood, and city government began an outreach effort to the Latino population.

=== 21st century ===
The 2010 United States census, the ZIP Code 20010, which includes Mount Pleasant, was one of the &quot;most whitened&quot; areas of the country, with the percentage of non-Hispanic white residents increasing from 22% in 2000 to 46.7% in 2010.

As of 2021, housing prices had risen significantly.

Structures in this area are primarily row houses of Neoclassical architecture with rear porches. The eastern side of the neighborhood, along 16th Street NW and Mount Pleasant Street, is marked by mid-rise apartment buildings.

The Eighteen Hundred Block Park Road, NW is notable for its 10 detached &quot;suburban&quot; houses on terraces overlooking the street.

<doc id="780894" wikidata="Q645084" url="?curid=780894" title="Virgin America">
<text>Virgin America Inc. was a low-cost airline headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, in the U.S. state of California. It primarily focused on operating low-fare, higher-quality service between cities on the West Coast of the United States and other major metropolitan areas. It operated both domestic and international flights, with hubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas, Texas.

Originally established in 2004, the airline began operations in 2007 as an independent airline company using branding licensed from the United Kingdom–based Virgin Group, which also controls the brand of the Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia airlines. The Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in April 2016, at a cost of approximately $4 billion and continued to operate Virgin America under its own name and brand until the airline was fully merged into Alaska Airlines on April 24, 2018.

==History==
===Founding (2004–2007)===
In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States–based, low-fare airline called &quot;Virgin USA&quot;. At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid 2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters. The airline changed its name from &quot;Virgin USA&quot; to &quot;Virgin America&quot; and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid 2005 to early 2006.

Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005. Once the new owners were on board, Virgin&#x27;s General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005. Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired in a debate between the supportive city and state representatives from California and New York and the opposing national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as a potential competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America&#x27;s application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, a subsidiary of the United Kingdom–based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.

In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America&#x27;s General Counsel David Pflieger and CEO Fred Reid filed a revised application that proposed a restructuring of the airline in January 2007; voting shares would be held by a Department of Transportation–approved trust and only two Virgin Group directors would be on the eight-person board. Additionally, Virgin America was open to removing Richard Branson from the airline&#x27;s board of directors and possibly removing the &quot;Virgin&quot; brand from the title altogether. Virgin America was tentatively cleared to fly by the U.S. Department of Transportation on March 20, 2007, on the condition that the airline would alter its business structure, including the limitation of foreign ownership shares to 25% and the replacement of Fred Reid (who had been hired by Virgin Group). The airline protested the stipulation concerning Reid&#x27;s removal to the federal regulators, arguing that the other stipulations ensured that the business would not be ruled by foreign interests. The Department of Transportation&#x27;s final agreement allowed Reid to remain involved with Virgin America until February 2008, after which he was required to leave the company.

===Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)===

Virgin America began selling tickets in July 2007. On August 8, 2007, the airline made its inaugural New York and Los Angeles to San Francisco flights — the aircraft was named &quot;Air Colbert&quot;, after comedian Stephen Colbert. In December 2007, C. David Cush replaced Reid as CEO of the airline. From the beginning of operations, Virgin America reported losses, beginning with $270 million in its first month, until the third quarter of 2010, when it achieved its first profit of $7.5 million.

On May 21, 2009, Virgin America became the first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access on every flight, via Gogo Inflight Internet. Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google. On December 17, 2014, Virgin America announced that it would offer faster fleet-wide ATG-4 in-flight WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.
In March 2010, Virgin America announced its intention to start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline&#x27;s first international destination. Following the Department of Transportation&#x27;s approval of Virgin America&#x27;s proposal to fly to Canada, international service began with flights to Toronto Pearson International Airport on June 29, 2010. However, due to high operating costs, response from competitors, slower growth than anticipated, and higher demand for Dallas/Fort Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011. Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after the repeal of the Wright Amendment in October 2014, when the airline leased two gates and established a focus city at Dallas Love Field and enhanced the number of connecting destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.

Virgin America announced in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, that would be delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010, though in November 2012 the airline deferred delivery of the aircraft to 2020. In April 2011, Virgin America&#x27;s hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines. In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre&#x27;s global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program. On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport.

===Alaska Airlines acquisition (2016–2018)===

Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3 million shares to raise $307 million for the company.

A number of airlines interested in a takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day&#x27;s closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, they would have been contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.

Virgin America&#x27;s founder Richard Branson expressed disappointment with the merger between Alaska Airlines and the airline he founded. In July 2016, Virgin America&#x27;s shareholders approved the merger, leaving the approval by the United States Department of Justice as the only foreseeable hurdle. In September 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Alaska Airlines by consumers to block the merger between the two carriers, which the Alaska Air Group settled in court in December 2016. Subsequently, the Department of Justice approved the acquisition, which was completed on December 14. Following the acquisition, the former chief financial officer of Alaska Airlines, Peter Hunt, became the president of Virgin America, while the former chief operating officer and president of Alaska Airlines, Ben Minicucci, became the chief executive officer.

Virgin America became the launch customer for the Airbus A321neo, with the airline placing a firm order for 10 aircraft through leasing company GE Capital Aviation Services. The first A321neo was delivered in Hamburg to Virgin America and entered service on May 31, 2017; a total of five A321neos were delivered to Virgin in 2017 and five in 2018. In early February 2017, Alaska Air Group said it was working with GE on an arrangement where it would not take delivery of all 10 ordered jets, in favor of keeping a predominantly Boeing fleet. A presentation given by Alaska Airlines&#x27; chief financial officer in March 2017 indicated that Alaska would take delivery of all 10 leased A321neos, and would absorb and operate Virgin America&#x27;s existing A319 and A320 fleet through at least 2024.

As part of the merger, some of Virgin&#x27;s amenities would be integrated into Alaska&#x27;s product. As Alaska Group was licensing the Virgin brand from Virgin Group, Branson indicated a willingness to relaunch the airline after the Virgin America brand was retired.

Virgin America made its final revenue flight under its callsign &quot;Redwood&quot; on January 10, 2018. The next day, on January 11, 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a single operating certificate for a combined Alaska Airlines and Virgin America.

Virgin America flights continued to operate using Virgin America aircraft, crew, and brand name until April 25, 2018, when the airlines merged into the same passenger service system. The final Virgin America revenue departure was Flight 1948 at 9:32 PM, traveling from the airline&#x27;s San Francisco headquarters to its other hub in Los Angeles, while the true final Virgin America departure was an employee charter operating as Flight 1947 from Los Angeles to San Francisco, which departed at 9:35 PM and operated under Virgin America&#x27;s original &quot;Redwood&quot; callsign. Overnight, the customer-facing portions of the company (including flight numbers, website, and airport check-in kiosks) were converted to use the Alaska Airlines brand.

From April 25, 2018, passengers could only see the Alaska Airlines brand online and in airports, and &quot;virginamerica.com&quot; would redirect to &quot;alaskaair.com&quot;. Prior to the brand cutover, livery repainting of Virgin America&#x27;s Airbus aircraft began in January 2018. Additionally, the interiors of the Airbus aircraft underwent refitting with seats similar to those in Alaska&#x27;s Boeing aircraft from September 2018, in another project expected to take several months to complete, with the first aircraft refit and unveiled in early 2019. The last plane wearing the Virgin America livery, the one that operated Flight 1948, was repainted in Alaska Airlines livery on June 2, 2019. Following the completion of the repainting of Virgin America&#x27;s aircraft, &quot;virginamerica.com&quot; instead redirected to Virgin Group&#x27;s website &quot;virgin.com&quot; rather than to &quot;alaskaair.com&quot;, and Virgin America&#x27;s social media profiles, such as its Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were subsequently either merged with those of Alaska Airlines, had their accounts closed, or otherwise had their content largely removed.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business trends===
The key trends for Virgin America over its later years were as follows (as at year ending December 31):
===Offices===
Virgin America leased of space at Bay Park Plaza II (formerly known as the Forbes Building), a building at 555 Airport Boulevard in Burlingame, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area, owned, leased, and managed by EQ Office. Virgin America occupied suite 500 in the building, which was located across a lagoon from U.S. Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway). Some of the space had since been repurposed as an Alaska Airlines office.

==Destinations==

As of April 2018, Virgin America flew to a total of 31 destinations, consisting of 28 domestic destinations and three in Mexico. In addition, the airline served five destinations that were terminated prior to the merger, consisting of four domestic destinations and one in Canada. Its primary hub was located at San Francisco International Airport, with its secondary hub at Los Angeles International Airport. Virgin America also maintained a focus city at Dallas Love Field, and operated a route between Las Vegas and New York JFK.

===Codeshare agreements===
The airline had codeshare agreements with the following airlines at the time of its acquisition:

* Alaska Airlines 
* Hawaiian Airlines
* Singapore Airlines
* Virgin Atlantic
* Virgin Australia
==Fleet==

As of January 11, 2018, at the time of the merger, Virgin America&#x27;s all-Airbus fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

==Cabin==

===In-flight entertainment===
Virgin America offered dual-class service on all flights it operated. Both cabins featured mood lighting and all seats were equipped with a Panasonic Avionics in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called &quot;Red&quot;. In July 2010, the &quot;Red&quot; software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities. The &quot;Red&quot; system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing the new Android seatback touch screen service, and a new position mapping system by Flightpath 3D.

===Seating===
First Class seats offered of pitch and were wide. The seats featured power-ports, adjustable headrests, a massage function, tablet friendly tray table (with two positions), and various recline controls. Passengers seated in first class received complimentary meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages, small amenity kit, long-haul guests received a large duvet &amp; pillow and received dedicated airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding. In first class, &quot;Red&quot; offered free live satellite television, free on-demand movies, free on-demand television programming and a selection of games. Guests could also utilize GoGo for limited, but free messaging on certain platforms. The front lavatory was for first class guests only.

Main Cabin Select was Virgin America&#x27;s premium economy product. It was not a distinct class; instead, on the A319-100 and A320-200, the service was located at Main Cabin seats in the exit row and behind the bulkheads. On their A321neo, the service was located in the first three rows of the Main Cabin. Passengers were offered more conveniences than in normal Main Cabin seats and had of seat pitch, of width and dedicated luggage bins. Like in first class, meals, refreshments and alcoholic beverages were free, as were the premium television channels and movies. Airport check-in, security screening, and aircraft boarding were prioritized over Main Cabin passengers. Guests could also utilize GoGo for limited, but free messaging on certain platforms. The lavatories in the back were for all passengers flying in economy, including Main Cabin Select.

Main Cabin seats offered of pitch and were wide with power-ports and adjustable headrests. Following the merger with Alaska Airlines, &quot;Red&quot; mirrored Alaska&#x27;s in-flight service by offering live satellite television, on-demand movies, on-demand television shows, and a selection of games for free. In aligning further with Alaska Airlines, all movies and content were free for all guests, regardless of cabin. Furthermore, in addition to the free beverage service, passengers could order more complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, or purchase snacks, meals, special-branded amenity kit, pillow/blanket, and alcoholic beverages from their seats via &quot;Red&quot;. Guests could also utilize GoGo for limited, but free messaging on certain platforms.

Alaska Air Group had stated that as part of the reconfiguration, the Virgin America First Class seats would be removed and replaced with a different model to streamline the product with the Alaska Airlines product. The seats, while considered a downgrade from the current seats, would have only 41&quot; of seat pitch, slightly more recline than the current Alaska Airlines 737 First Class product, retaining the Virgin America foot rests, and different placement of the powerports. The number of First Class seats would increase from 8 to 16 seats on the A321neo, and from eight to twelve seats on both the A319 and A320.

Alaska also reconfigured the Virgin America Airbus fleet to include at least three rows of Main Cabin Select, which was a significant change as the current configuration included the emergency exit row (or second row in Airbus A320 fleet) as part of Main Cabin Select; these seats would now just be considered preferred seats/extra legroom after integration.

In April 2020, in response to COVID-19 pandemic impacts, Alaska indefinitely stored all aircraft that retained Virgin America interiors, and none had flown for Alaska again.
==Frequent-flyer program==
Virgin America&#x27;s frequent-flyer program was Elevate, which allowed passengers to earn five points for every dollar spent on a flight&#x27;s base fare, which excluded taxes and other fees. The program was discontinued on January 1, 2018. Elevate members were given the option to manually convert Elevate points into Alaska Airlines&#x27; Mileage Plan miles until January 31, 2018, with any remaining Elevate points automatically converted by February 8, 2018.

Following the discontinuation of Elevate in January 2018, flights operated by Virgin America continued to earn credit on Alaska Airlines&#x27; Mileage Plan and the frequent flyer programs of partner airlines (including Hawaiian Airlines‘ HawaiianMiles, Emirates Skywards, Singapore Airlines’ KrisFlyer, or Virgin Australia&#x27;s Velocity Frequent Flyer) until Virgin America was integrated into Alaska Airlines on April 25, 2018.

<doc id="780896" wikidata="Q1508669" url="?curid=780896" title="George Zoritch">
<text>George Zoritch (born Yuri Zorich; Russian: Юрий Зорич; 6 June 1917 – 1 November 2009), was a Russian-born American ballet dancer who starred in performances by Ballet Russe companies on stages all over the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s. Internationally known, he was one of the most glamorous figures and striking personalities in mid-twentieth-century ballet.

==Early life and training==
George Zoritch was born in Moscow during the Russian Revolution in June 1917. He was the youngest of two sons. When he was a year old, the two boys were taken by their mother Elena, an opera singer, to the quieter city of Kovno (Kaunas), the provisional capital of Lithuania to live with her mother after she left her husband due to his infidelities. Known as &quot;Little Paris&quot; because of its rich cultural and academic life, the city offered refuge from the revolutionary strife of Moscow. There, Madam Zoritch joined the opera company at the National Opera and Ballet Theater, while Yuri and his older brother began their first dance lessons. When Yuri was 14 years old, the family relocated to Paris to advance his training. A promising student, he won a scholarship to study with one of the most prominent teachers in the city, Olga Preobrajenskaya, a former star of the Russian Imperial Ballet. In later years, he would polish his classical technique through study with such famous pedagogues as Anatole Vilzak, Anatole Oboukhoff, and Bronislava Nijinska.

==Professional career==
After only nine months&#x27; study with Preobrajenskaya, young Yuri, was given his first professional job in 1932 by the dancer and actress Ida Rubenstein, who had a short season booked at the Paris Opera featuring ballets created by Michel Fokine. Following this engagement, Zoritch rapidly became a sought-after performer in a number of companies linked with former stars of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s famous Ballets Russes.

===Ballet Russe companies===
An engagement with Nijinska&#x27;s Ballets de Paris in 1935 led to his long-time membership in the two Ballets Russes offshoots formed after Diaghilev&#x27;s death in 1929: Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, directed by René Blum, and Original Ballet Russe, directed by Colonel Wassily de Basil. In the de Basil company, the 18-year-old Zoritch became a favorite of the choreographer Léonide Massine, who cast him in no fewer than eleven ballets, notably &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; (1936), set to the hallucinatory music of Hector Berlioz. Massine and Tamara Toumanova took the lead roles of the Young Musician and the Beloved. Zoritch danced in the Melancholy &quot;pas de trois&quot; in the first movement (Reveries), as the Young Shepherd in the third movement (Scene in the Fields), and, with Roman Jasinski and Paul Petroff, as one of the three Monsters in the fifth movement (Dream of the Night of the Sabbath).

In 1938, after a dispute with Colonel de Basil, René Blum won legal rights to the name Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, which he soon sold to wealthy American businessmen. With Massine as artistic director, they created a company expressly to tour the United States and to present occasional seasons in Monte Carlo and London. Yuri Zoritch, now known as George, was one of its principal male dancers, along with Igor Youskevitch and Frederic Franklin. They often danced with ballerinas Alexandra Danilova, Rosella Hightower, and Nathalie Krassovska. During the company&#x27;s American tours over the next few years, Zoritch&#x27;s startling good looks and winning personality on stage attracted increased attention to his dancing. &quot;It is impossible for him to make a bad line, to move unrhythmically,&quot; wrote one critic, &quot;for there is a catlike smoothness about everything he does.&quot;

Zoritch was notable in two new roles in vastly different works by Massine: in &quot;Bogatyri&quot; (1938), set to music by Alexander Borodin, he portrayed Khan, the fearsome Mongol leader, and in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1940), set to music by George Gershwin, he was the magazine&#x27;s signature character of the effete Eustace Tilley. Neither of these works enjoyed much success, however, and both were soon dropped from the repertory. Between these two, Zoritch appeared in a more substantial ballet, as the Fiancé in Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Devil&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, a major work in a prologue and three scenes set to music by Vincenzo Tommasini on themes of Niccolo Paganini. Presented at the Metropolitan Opera House in October 1939. it had a star-studded cast and a complicated love story that required the Devil himself to sort out. Hence Ashton&#x27;s alternate title: &quot;Le Diable s&#x27;Amuse&quot;.

===Broadway and Hollywood===

During the 1940s, Zoritch had a parallel career in Broadway musicals and Hollywood movies.
* 1943. &quot;Early to Bed&quot;. A musical comedy with book and lyrics by George Mason Jr., music by Thomas &quot;Fats&quot; Waller, and dances by Robert Alton. Zoritch appeared as Pablo, dancing with Jane Deering to &quot;Slightly Less Than Wonderful.&quot;
* 1944. &quot;Rhapsody&quot;. An operetta with book by Leonard Louis Levenson and Arnold Sundgaard, music by Fritz Kreisler, and choreography by David Lichine. Zoritch danced with Patricia Bowman in &quot;Chinese Porcelain Ballet&quot; in act 1 and &quot;Midnight Ballet&quot; in act 2.
* 1946. &quot;Night and Day&quot;. A fictionalized biopic of Cole Porter, directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith. Zoritch danced with Milada Mladova in a sultry &quot;Begin the Beguine.&quot;
* 1947. &quot;Escape Me Never&quot;. A musical love story set in 1900 Venice, with Errol Flynn, Ida Lupino, Eleanor Parker, and Gig Young, who plays a composer of a ballet score. Zoritch dances the male lead in the ballet.
* 1949. &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. A Cecil B. DeMille epic, starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr as the biblical lovers. Zoritch was eye-catching as the Sword Dancer.
*1949. &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;. A fictionalized biopic of vaudeville and Broadway star Marilyn Miller, starring June Haver, Ray Bolger, and Gordon MacRae. Zoritch appears in a balletic &quot;pas de trois&quot; with June Haver and Oleg Tupine while Gordon MacRae sings the waltz song &quot;A Kiss in the Dark,&quot; written by Victor Herbert with lyrics by Buddy da Sylva.
* 1950. &quot;Pardon Our French&quot;. A musical revue with sketches by Ole Olson and Chic Johnson, music by Victor Young and Harry Sukman, and dances by various choreographers. Zoritch appeared as the Shadow Dancer in the opening number to the title tune; as the First Lover of Patricia Denise in &quot;Venezia and Her Three Lovers,&quot; choreographed by Ernst Matray; and as a dancer in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; and &quot;The Polker Polka.&quot;
* 1956. &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;. A Technicolor epic directed by Robert Wise, with Rossana Podestá in the title role. Zoritch appears as an uncredited dancer.

Of Zoritch&#x27;s performance in &quot;Night and Day&quot;, a writer in the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented, &quot;If the handsome Zoritch can act the way he dances and looks, there is another new-name star from this film.: Unfortunately, Zoritch never shed his thick Russian accent, which doomed his chances of ever taking speaking parts.

In 1951, Zoritch went to France and joined Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas. Based in Cannes in summer and Deauville in winter, this company had regular seasons in Paris and often toured in France and other countries of western Europe. Wherever it performed, it was extremely popular with audiences. It had an illustrious roster of ballerinas, including Tamara Toumanova, Alicia Markova, and Nathalie Krassovska, and a strong repertory of Russian classics as well as works by Harold Lander, George Balanchine, George Skibine, and John Taras. Zoritch danced the princely roles but was often cast in works that showcased the beauty of his physical features rather than the artistry of his dancing. He once took eighteen curtain calls after a performance of &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot;, in a new version choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska. Costumed as the Spectre in a sheer, rose-colored body stocking with a single strand of small roses trailing across his bare chest and over one shoulder, his beautifully proportioned figure was perfectly revealed. It is little wonder at the audience&#x27;s prolonged applause. There is a famous photograph by Maurice Seymour of Zoritch in this role, standing in repose with arms curved softly aloft, that has been much admired and frequently reproduced.

In 1957, at age 40, Zoritch returned to the United States and rejoined Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, then under the direction of Sergei Denham. He soon demonstrated that he was, in the words of Walter Terry, &quot;the perfect cavalier&quot; for the company&#x27;s current ballerinas and distinguished guests such as Alicia Alonso and Yvette Chauviré. Ann Barzel supported this judgment, claiming that Zoritch&#x27;s &quot;elegance was the backbone of the classics&quot; in the company repertory. These included &quot;Giselle, The Nutcracker, Raymonda,&quot; and act 2 of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. Basides these Russian classics, Zoritch excelled in other works in the repertory. He was particularly acclaimed as the Poet in Michel Fokine&#x27;s Romantic reverie &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, set to the music of Frédéric Chopin.

In the course of his long career, Zoritch&#x27;s most famous role, however, was in a revolutionary work created in the early twentieth century: Vaslav Nijinsky&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot;, set to Claude Debussy&#x27;s symphonic poem in 1912. Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot; (1894), inspired by an 1876 poem of Stéphane Mallarmé, was considered by some music historians as &quot;the beginning of modern music.&quot; Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography was certainly new and modern, very different from previously seen forms of theatrical dance. George Zoritch was ideally suited to reinterpret Nijinsky&#x27;s vision of a lusty young woodland creature lounging in the heat of a summer afternoon. With a figure that had been likened to &quot;a Greek youth sculpted by Praxiteles,&quot; he projected an elegant eroticism particularly suited to the role.

==Later years==
Having become an American citizen, Zoritch settled down in his new, adopted country and moved gradually from performing to teaching. He played an important part in the growth of regional ballet across the United States but remained associated with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo until 1962, when the company was dissolved. In 1964, he opened a ballet school in West Hollywood, California, where he exercised strict discipline and often employed sarcasm in giving corrections to his pupils. Finding children disagreeable, he preferred older students, to whom he gave master classes. Leaving California, he joined the dance faculty at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He established a home there and taught at the university from 1972 to 1987. He never really stopped teaching. Amazingly spry and upright even in old age, he had been known to teach from a wheelchair if the opportunity arose. In 1994, he was a recipient of a Vaslav Nijinsky Medal, sponsored by the Polish Artists Agency in Warsaw, for work in honor of Nijinsky, referring to his performances of Nijinsky&#x27;s roles in &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot;.

In his memoir, Zoritch readily acknowledged that he was not a bravura technician. Declaring that artistry was more important than technique for dancers like him, he wrote, &quot;Good ballet dancing is not simply a gathering of a vocabulary of steps; it is more like a good conversation, having theme and meaning. None of us older dancers enjoyed the phenomenal techniques displayed by today&#x27;s dancers. We enjoyed, however, a mood, a quality, and artistry, which comes from keen individual perception.&quot;

Zoritch&#x27;s personality, charm, and wisdom survive delightfully in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;, a priceless reunion of the survivors from the post-Diaghilev days. Four years later, in 2009, he was hospitalized after a fall in his home in Tucson. He died in November, at age 92, beloved by former colleagues and students alike.

==Further information==

There is a memorial to Walter Napleton Stone in Greenwich Cemetery, south-east London. About thirty yards in front of the War Memorial is a group of graves of the Stone family. On the largest are the names of Walter&#x27;s parents, and underneath the inscription:

:&quot;also in memory of Lt Col Arthur Stone DSO, 16th Lanc Fusiliers, second son of the above, killed 2 October 1918...; and Capt Walter Napleton Stone VC, 17th Royal Fusiliers, fifth son of the above, killed Bourlon Wood, France, 30 November 1917, presumed buried by the Germans near Moeuvres.&quot;

<text>The long bones are those that are longer than they are wide. They are one of five types of bones: long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid. Long bones, especially the femur and tibia, are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis, with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage (&quot;articular cartilage&quot;). The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate. Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (GH), a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.

The long bone category includes the femora, tibiae, and fibulae of the legs; the humeri, radii, and ulnae of the arms; metacarpals and metatarsals of the hands and feet, the phalanges of the fingers and toes, and the clavicles or collar bones. The long bones of the human leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height are the vertebrae and skull.

The outside of the bone consists of a layer of connective tissue called the periosteum. Additionally, the outer shell of the long bone is compact bone, then a deeper layer of cancellous bone (spongy bone) which contains in the medullary cavity the bone marrow.

==Structure==
The outer shell of the long bone is made of cortical bone also known as compact bone. This is covered by a membrane of connective tissue called the periosteum. Beneath the cortical bone layer is a layer of spongy cancellous bone. Inside this is the medullary cavity which has an inner core of bone marrow, it contains nutrients and help in formation of cells, made up of yellow marrow in the adult and red marrow in the child.

==Clinical significance==
There are two congenital disorders of the long bones. In a disorder known as &quot;rachitis fetalis anularis&quot; the ends of the long bones (epiphyses) are enlarged. Another disorder, &quot;rachitis fetalis micromelica&quot;, is a deficiency in the growth (as a shortness) of the bones.

There is a surgical procedure called distraction osteogenesis which is used to lengthen long bones.

<text>Duet is an American sitcom that aired on Fox from April 19, 1987, to May 7, 1989. Originally, the story centered on the romance of a novelist (Matthew Laurance) and a caterer (Mary Page Keller), but gradually the focus shifted to their yuppie friends (Chris Lemmon, Alison LaPlaca) and the show was rebranded as &quot;Open House&quot;. The series was created by Ruth Bennett and Susan Seeger, and was produced by Paramount Television.

==Synopsis==
Ben Coleman is a struggling mystery novelist, while his girlfriend Laura Kelly is a caterer with her younger sister Jane (Jodi Thelen). Richard and Linda Phillips were a high-powered yuppie couple. He was in the family patio-furniture business and she was a studio executive. Linda&#x27;s boss at World Wide Studios was Cooper Hayden (Larry Poindexter), who eventually became infatuated with Jane. Richard later quit his job to become a professional pianist. Geneva (Arleen Sorkin) was the Phillipses&#x27; wisecracking, sexy maid who sometimes fraternized with the sisters.

Near the end of season 2, Linda gave birth to a daughter, Amanda. When the show returned for season 3, Amanda was now a four-year-old (Ginger Orsi). Also at the start of season 3 Ben and Laura had married, and Linda lost her job at World Wide Studios. Linda then sought a partnership in Laura&#x27;s catering business. Just prior to the end of that season, Linda met real estate mogul Ted Nichols, played by guest star and LaPlaca&#x27;s then-boyfriend, Philip Charles MacKenzie. Ted schmoozed her into joining his realty firm, selling upscale properties to snobs just like herself.

When the show returned for a 4th season, it was now retitled &quot;Open House&quot;, and was centered around Linda and Ted. The characters of Laura, Richard, Amanda and Geneva all returned for &quot;Open House&quot;, but Amanda and Geneva were written out after only a few episodes. Eventually so was Richard. The spin-off lasted for one season.

==Production==
The series was among the first to appear on the Fox network when they launched a Sunday night prime-time TV lineup in 1987, alongside &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and &quot;Mr. President&quot;. Loosely based on the love lives of creators Bennett and Seeger, the show was originally noted for being serialized, with events unfolding in succession from week to week.

Matthew Laurance was the first actor hired, but they couldn&#x27;t find a leading lady that sparked with him in Los Angeles, so they held auditions in New York, where they finally found Mary Page Keller. Keller and Jodi Thelen met at the audition and had such an instantaneous sisterly rapport that they were both cast within days. Alison LaPlaca was originally hired to appear as the undefined wife of a supporting character in two episodes, but a pregnancy was written into the next script, requiring her to stick around. Acting wasn&#x27;t Chris Lemmon&#x27;s primary career goal—he had studied extensively as a pianist—but his musical dreams and abilities were eventually utilized in the show.

There was a period of adjustment as the actors became familiar with one another, but once things began to click, there was a fun atmosphere on the set, and little interference from the network. Susan Seeger got her whole family into the act, with brother David and their famous father Hal Seeger creating the opening title sequence, sister Mindy portraying Ben&#x27;s publicist Nina, and sister Charbie Dahl (aka Charlene Seeger) writing a few of the scripts.

Although the first season focused squarely on Ben and Laura, season two became an ensemble with ongoing stories revolving around Jane, Richard, and Linda. As the meaning of the show&#x27;s title blurred, Fox tried to spin it in promotion claiming, &quot;Duet means two, so why is it about five people, a dog, and a baby? Because it&#x27;s a show you shouldn&#x27;t watch alone!&quot; By the third season, Fox executives began forcing changes. Noticing the popularity of Alison LaPlaca&#x27;s character, they pushed Ben, Laura, and Jane into the background as stories became exclusively centered on Linda and Richard. They also flashed ahead three years so they could turn the Phillipses daughter into a talking toddler, which was proving popular with audiences on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Full House&quot;. The Phillipses also eclipsed the newlywed Colemans in the network&#x27;s promotion.

The theme music over the opening titles was composed by Buddy Budson, and in the first two seasons performed by Ursula Walker and Tony Franklin.

Beginning in season two, the opening titles changed to begin featuring clips of the characters in scenes from the show. These were book-ended by the show&#x27;s title appearing in gold on a maroon leather-textured photo album cover, which opened to reveal the series of episode clips, and the photo album closing, with creators Ruth Bennett and Susan Seeger being credited in gold on the album cover. (In season one, the show title was displayed over the beginning of the opening scene.) In season three, the same sequence style remained, but the theme music was rearranged into a complete saxophone/electric guitar instrumental, with the instruments taking the place of the notes sung by vocalists Walker and Franklin.

Note: * Ben&#x27;s dog (live animal actor)

==Broadcast history==
==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1987)===
Note: Many of the titles that appear on-screen differ from those found in TV listings. Only the first season featured on-screen title cards, as well as music-themed names.

===Season 2 (1987–1988)===
===Season 3 (1988–1989)===
==Reception==
The show received a largely positive reception. TV Guide compared it to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, noting that it &quot;manages to balance whimsy and reality.&quot; Remarking on the Sunday night schedule, which included a movie-of-the-week on two of the three other broadcast networks, &quot;The Houston Post&quot; said, &quot;If you are tired of movie after movie on the networks, &quot;Duet&quot; is for you.&quot; The &quot;South Florida Sentinel&quot; hailed it as Fox&#x27;s &quot;best series to date&quot;, and &quot;The Journal News&quot; remarked that &quot;producers Ruth Bennett and Susan Seeger choreograph this mating dance beautifully.&quot;

Despite good reviews, the show remained ratings-challenged. The Fox network was initially regarded as a joke in Hollywood and ratings weren&#x27;t published until the second season, which found &quot;Duet&quot; near the bottom of the yearly TV ratings list in 118th place. The third season didn&#x27;t fare much better, with it ranking in 104th place.

<text>In mathematical analysis, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem is a theorem proved by the Danish mathematicians Harald Bohr and Johannes Mollerup. The theorem characterizes the gamma function, defined for by

:formula_1

as the &quot;only&quot; positive function , with domain on the interval , that simultaneously has the following three properties:

* , and
* for and
* is logarithmically convex.

A treatment of this theorem is in Artin&#x27;s book &quot;The Gamma Function&quot;, which has been reprinted by the AMS in a collection of Artin&#x27;s writings.

The theorem was first published in a textbook on complex analysis, as Bohr and Mollerup thought it had already been proved.

The theorem admits a far-reaching generalization to a wide variety of functions (that have convexity or concavity properties of any order).

==Statement==
:Bohr–Mollerup Theorem.     is the only function that satisfies with convex and also with .

==Proof==
Let be a function with the assumed properties established above: and is convex, and . From we can establish

:formula_2

The purpose of the stipulation that forces the property to duplicate the factorials of the integers so we can conclude now that if and if exists at all. Because of our relation for , if we can fully understand for then we understand for all values of .

For , , the slope of the line segment connecting the points and is monotonically increasing in each argument with since we have stipulated that is convex. Thus, we know that
:formula_3
After simplifying using the various properties of the logarithm, and then exponentiating (which preserves the inequalities since the exponential function is monotonically increasing) we obtain
:formula_4
From previous work this expands to
:formula_5
and so
:formula_6
The last line is a strong statement. In particular, &quot;it is true for all values of&quot; . That is is not greater than the right hand side for any choice of and likewise, is not less than the left hand side for any other choice of . Each single inequality stands alone and may be interpreted as an independent statement. Because of this fact, we are free to choose different values of for the RHS and the LHS. In particular, if we keep for the RHS and choose for the LHS we get:

:formula_7

It is evident from this last line that a function is being sandwiched between two expressions, a common analysis technique to prove various things such as the existence of a limit, or convergence. Let :

:formula_8

so the left side of the last inequality is driven to equal the right side in the limit and

:formula_9

is sandwiched in between. This can only mean that

:formula_10

In the context of this proof this means that

:formula_11

has the three specified properties belonging to . Also, the proof provides a specific expression for . And the final critical part of the proof is to remember that the limit of a sequence is unique. This means that for any choice of only one possible number can exist. Therefore, there is no other function with all the properties assigned to .

The remaining loose end is the question of proving that makes sense for all where

:formula_11

exists. The problem is that our first double inequality

:formula_13

was constructed with the constraint . If, say, then the fact that is monotonically increasing would make , contradicting the inequality upon which the entire proof is constructed. However,

:formula_14

which demonstrates how to bootstrap to all values of where the limit is defined.

<text>Fawn Hall (born September 15, 1959) is a former secretary to Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North who gained fame for her role in the Iran–Contra affair by helping North shred confidential documents.

==Early life==
Born in Annandale, Virginia, in 1959, Hall graduated from Annandale High School in 1977. She began working part-time in a clerical position for the United States Navy, beginning in January 1976 while she was in high school. After graduating, she began working full-time for the Navy at the Pentagon.

In 1987, Hall lived in Annandale, with her mother and stepfather.

==Involvement in Iran–Contra==
Hall was detailed from the Navy to work at the National Security Council on February 26, 1983, as Oliver North&#x27;s secretary. She worked for North until she was fired on November 25, 1986, at the height of the scandal. Hall&#x27;s mother, Wilma Hall, was secretary to Robert McFarlane, Reagan&#x27;s national security advisor, North&#x27;s superior and a major player in the Iran–Contra affair.

In one mishap, Hall transposed the digits of a Swiss bank account number, resulting in a contribution from the Sultan of Brunei to the Contras being credited to a Swiss businessman&#x27;s bank account instead of the intended account.

In June 1987, Hall, herself, began two days of testimony in front of the United States Congress. She confessed to altering, shredding a large number of documents (so much was destroyed, she said, that the office shredder jammed), and smuggling others in her boots and inside her clothing and giving them to North on November 25, 1986, who was fired after his role in orchestrating potentially illegal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras became public. Among her other testimony was an assertion that, &quot;Sometimes you have to go above the law.&quot; Journalist Bob Woodward recorded that her legal defense justification was summarized in her words: &quot;We shred everything&quot;. In 1989, in exchange for her testimony against North for the Iran–Contra affair, she was granted immunity from prosecution.

==Life after the Iran–Contra affair==
After the Iran–Contra affair broke, Hall briefly went back to work for the Navy in 1987 for less than 6 months. She was invited to the 1987 White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner by journalist Michael Kelly. After her congressional testimony in June 1987, she left government service and signed with the William Morris Agency and unsuccessfully pursued a media career in the Washington, D.C., area. 

&quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; offered six-figure payments for nude photoshoots to Hall, as well as two other women involved in high-profile 1987 scandals, Donna Rice and Jessica Hahn. Hall and Rice declined all offers, whereas Hahn agreed to appear in &quot;Playboy&quot;.

In April 1990, Hall was a freelance TV reporter in Pittsburgh.

In 1992, Hall worked for a law firm in Los Angeles, California, and she pursued a modeling career for several years. Hall dated the actor Rob Lowe who tracked her down after seeing her at the Oliver North trial, and the couple attended Jack Lemmon&#x27;s AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony in 1988. 

In April 1993, Hall married Danny Sugerman, former manager of The Doors. The Sugermans lived in the Hollywood Hills. She was a cocaine user when she held jobs on the National Security Council staff and at the Pentagon. It was reported that Sugerman introduced Hall to crack cocaine shortly after their marriage. She developed a crack cocaine addiction and suffered a non-lethal overdose in 1994, following which she went into rehab. Sugerman died in 2005 of lung cancer, and in 2007 Hall listed the house for sale for almost $2.5 million, and in 2014, it was acquired for only $1.96 million.

As of 2012, Hall was living in West Hollywood, working at a bookstore and staying out of the public eye.

<text>The blastocoel (), also spelled blastocoele and blastocele, and also called cleavage cavity, or segmentation cavity is a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity that forms in the blastula during very early embryonic development. At this stage in mammals the blastula is called the blastocyst, which consists of an outer epithelium, the trophectoderm, enveloping the inner cell mass and the blastocoel .

It develops following cleavage of the zygote after fertilization. It is the first fluid-filled cavity or lumen formed as the embryo enlarges, and is the essential precursor for the differentiated gastrula. In the &quot;Xenopus&quot; a very small cavity has been described in the two-cell stage of development.

After fertilization, the zygote undergoes several rounds of cleavage divisions forming daughter cells known as blastomeres. At the 8- or 16-cell stage, the embryo undergoes compaction and forms the morula. Eventually, the morula is a solid ball of cells that has a small group of internal cells surrounded by a larger group of external cells. Then blastomeres undergo cellular differentiation with internal cells adopting the inner cell mass fate and the external layer becoming trophectoderm. The inner cell mass will go on to become the actual embryo. The external, surrounding cells develop into trophoblast cells, which only contribute to extra-embryonic tissues. At this stage there is no lumen within the embryo. In a process called cavitation, trophectoderm cells transport fluid into the embryo to create a blastocoel, the fluid-filled lumen. The membranes of the trophectoderm cells contain sodium (Na+) pumps, Na+/K+- ATPase and Na+/H+ exchangers, that pump sodium into the embryo. The oviduct cells stimulate these trophoblast sodium pumps as the fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. The accumulation of sodium pulls in water through osmosis. The accumulation of water breaks open cell-cell contacts via hydraulic fracturing. To form a single lumen, the fluid from multiple water pockets collects into a single entity in process akin to Ostwald ripening. The blastocoel further expands and the inner cell mass becomes positioned on one side of the trophoblast cells forming a mammalian blastula, called a blastocyst. The axis formed by the inner cell mass and the blastocoel is the first axis of symmetry of mammalian embryo and determines its attachment point to the uterus.

== In amphibians ==
An amphibian embryo in the 128- cell stage is considered a blastula as the blastocoel in the embryo becomes apparent during this stage. The fluid-filled cavity forms in the animal hemisphere of the frog. However, the early formation of the blastocoel has been traced back to the very first cleavage furrow. It was demonstrated in the frog embryo that the first cleavage furrow widens in the animal hemisphere creating a small intercellular cavity that is sealed off via tight junctions. As cleavage continues, the cavity expands to become the developed blastocoel. The blastocoel is a crucial component of amphibian embryo development. It permits cell migration during gastrulation and prevents the cells beneath the blastocoel from interacting prematurely with the cells above the blastocoel. For instance, the blastocoel prevents the vegetal cells destined to become endoderm from coming in contact with those cells in the ectoderm fated to give rise to the skin and nerves.

=== Damage to blastocoel ===
The blastocoel can be damaged and abolished if the adhesion between blastomeres, provided by cell adhesion molecules like EP-cadherin, is destroyed as mRNA by oligonucleotides. If the mRNA is destroyed, then there’s no EP-cadherin, little to no blastomere adhesion and the blastocoel is non-existent. During the next stage of embryonic development, amphibian gastrulation, the blastocoel is displaced by the formation of the archenteron, during mid-gastrulation. At the end of gastrulation, the blastocoel has been obliterated.

== In sea urchins ==
At the 120- cell stage, the sea urchin embryo is considered a blastula because of its developed blastocoel, which every embryonic cell surrounds and touches. Every cell is in contact with the proteinaceous fluid of the blastocoel on the inside and touches the hyaline layer on the outside. The loosely connected blastomeres are now tightly connected because of tight junctions that create a seamless epithelium that completely encircles the blastocoel. Even as the blastomeres continue to divide, the blastula remains one-cell thick and thins out as the embryo expands outward. This is accomplished in part due to the influx of water that expands the blastocoel and pushes the cells surrounding it outwards. At this point, the cells have become specified and are ciliated on the opposite side of the blastocoel. The vegetal plate and animal hemisphere develop and secrete a hatching enzyme that digests the fertilization envelope and allows the embryo to now become a free-swimming hatched blastula.

=== Development of primary mesenchyme ===
Important to the sea urchin blastula is the ingression of the primary mesenchyme. After the blastula hatches from the fertilization envelope, the vegetal side of the blastula begins to flatten and thicken as a small cluster of these cells develop long, thin processes called filopodia. These cells then dissociate and ingress into the blastocoel and are called the primary mesenchyme. The cells move randomly along the inside of the blastocoel, until they become localized in the ventrolateral region of the blastocoel.

== In birds ==
Similar to mammals, fertilization of the avian ovum occurs in the oviduct. From there the blastodisc, a small cluster of cells in the animal pole of the egg, then undergoes discoidal meroblastic cleavage. The blastoderm develops into the epiblast and hypoblast and it is between these layers that the blastocoel will form. The shape and formation of the avian blastodisc differs from amphibian, fish, and echinoderm blastulas, but the overall spatial relationship of the blastocoel remains the same.

=== Formation of primitive streak ===
The avian blastocoel is important during the development of the primitive streak. The ingression of the endodermal precursor cells form the epiblast into the blastocoel and the migration of lateral cells of the posterior epiblast towards the center form the early primitive streak. As these cells converge inward, a depression forms called the primitive groove and functions as an opening through which cells travel into the blastocoel. As cells migrate into the blastocoel, they undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation.

== In zebrafish ==
Unlike amphibian, echinoderm, mammalian, and avian embryos, zebrafish do not have a defined blastocoel. Rather, they have small, irregular extracellular spaces that are formed between the cells of the blastodisc sitting atop the yolk.

<text>In Brazil, public holidays may be legislated at the federal, statewide and municipal levels. Most holidays are observed nationwide.

Apart from the yearly official holidays (listed below), the Constitution of Brazil also establishes that election days are to be considered national holidays as well. General elections are biennially held on the first Sunday of October in the first round, and on the last Sunday of October in the second round. Numerous religious and ethnic holidays are also celebrated in Brazil.


==Secondary holidays==
* Fat Tuesday, The day of Carnival. 
* Ash Wednesday Wednesday after Carnival, the last Carnival day.
* Good Friday, the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, is a municipal holiday in many places.
* Dia das Mães, the Brazilian observation of Mother&#x27;s Day, is celebrated every second Sunday in May.
* Corpus Christi is celebrated on the Thursday, 60 days after Easter Sunday.
* Dia dos Namorados, the Brazilian equivalent of St. Valentine&#x27;s Day, is observed on June 12. On this day, boyfriends and girlfriends, husbands and wives, exchange gifts, cards, or a flower bouquet. It is celebrated on the eve of St. Anthony of Padua&#x27;s day, because, in Brazil, he is considered the patron of those who wants a loving companion.
* Festas Juninas, the Catholic feasts of Santo Antônio, São João and São Pedro are celebrated June 13, 24, and 29 respectively in many Brazilian cities, especially in the Northeast region.
* Dia dos Pais, the Brazilian observation of Father&#x27;s Day, is celebrated every second Sunday in August.
* Dia das Crianças, the Brazilian Children&#x27;s Day, is celebrated on October 12, coinciding with the feast of Our Lady of Aparecida.

==Regional holidays==

Federal law gives each state the right to create one state holiday, and each municipality to create up to four municipal holidays. Some of the more notable ones are:
* January 12: Founding of Belém, City of Belém only.

The first 14 teams in the UCI ranking at 31 January 2004 were automatically invited. These were: Wildcards were sent to a further seven teams.

Initially the organisers had an option for a 22nd team, which would be Kelme, but after Jesús Manzano exposed doping use in that team, Kelme was not invited, and the race started with 21 teams of nine cyclists.

<text>The Surreal Life is an American reality television series that records a group of celebrities as they live together for a limited number of weeks. Initial seasons took place in Glen Campbell&#x27;s former mansion in the Hollywood Hills for two weeks. The format of the show resembles that of &quot;The Real World&quot; in that the cameras not only record the castmates&#x27; participation in group activities assigned to them, but also their interpersonal relationships and conflicts. The show&#x27;s first two seasons aired on The WB, and subsequent seasons were shown on VH1.

On September 13, 2023, it was reported that the series would move to MTV for its eighth season. The season, titled &quot;Villa of Secrets&quot;, premiered on July 23, 2024.

==Production history==
&quot;The Surreal Life&quot; creators, Cris Abrego, Mark Cronin, and Rick Telles, met with their agents (Chris Coelen and Sara Chazen at UTA) who pitched the idea to them as a possible reality show concept and suggested the title &quot;Surreal World&quot; (after MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World&quot;). The name was later changed to &quot;Surreal Life&quot; to avoid legal issues.

==Casting==
===Season 1===
The first season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on January 9, 2003, and starred Gabrielle Carteris, MC Hammer, Corey Feldman, Emmanuel Lewis, Jerri Manthey, Vince Neil, and Brande Roderick. Throughout the two-week production, the cast participated in a &quot;Survivor&quot;-inspired camping trip, a trip to Las Vegas, and a drama-creating Corey Feldman, who married his girlfriend in the season finale.

===Season 2===
The second season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on January 11, 2004, and starred Traci Bingham, Trishelle Cannatella, Erik Estrada, Tammy Faye Messner, Ron Jeremy, and Vanilla Ice. Some episode plots involved Ron Jeremy&#x27;s topless porn-star pool party and Tammy Faye&#x27;s book signing with members of the gay and transgender community. In one episode, the cast works at a local retro diner under the management, Vanilla Ice hoists Gary Coleman above the deep fryer, and insists on having the former child star say his catchphrase, &quot;What&#x27;chu talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout, Willis?&quot; in public after Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Strokes&quot; co-star Todd Bridges shows up. These acts led the former sitcom star to &quot;fire&quot; Ice and then quit. The season also introduced &quot;Dirty Laundry,&quot; &quot;The&quot; &quot;Surreal Life&quot; talk show hosted by Sally Jessy Raphael. Raphael focused on Cannatella, making several unflattering remarks about her drinking problem, including that she acted &quot;like a slut.&quot; Other moments included a surprise stop at the Desert Shadows Inn, a nudist resort (from which Tammy Faye fled in tears), and the production of a children&#x27;s play.

===Season 3===
The third season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on September 5, 2004, and starred Charo, Dave Coulier, Flavor Flav, Jordan Knight, Brigitte Nielsen, and Ryan Starr. Memorable moments included Date Night, an agonizing recording session for the group to produce an original song, and Flavor&#x27;s insistence that he drive the group&#x27;s RV despite not having a license. Flavor also caused a brief disconnection with the cast, when it was revealed during &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; that he had hit &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; puppy. &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; puppy lived in Long Beach, California after being given to friends of Dave Coulier after the show. The puppy was named Winger after the Detroit Red Wings. Throughout the two weeks, Nielsen and Flav began a relationship which would have a dramatic influence on VH1&#x27;s programming over the next five years, as it indirectly spawned 14 spinoffs and sequels to date. The romance first continued in &quot;Strange Love&quot; and snowballed from there, after the success of the &quot;Flavor of Love&quot; series.

===Season 4===
The fourth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on January 9, 2005, and starred Da Brat, Adrianne Curry, Christopher Knight, Chyna, Marcus Schenkenberg, Verne Troyer, and Jane Wiedlin. Notable moments included conflict between Da Brat and Wiedlin that stemmed from comments made by Da Brat about Wiedlin that were shown during &quot;Dirty Laundry,&quot; and the strained relationship between Chyna and her now-ex-boyfriend Sean Waltman. More memorable moments included Troyer getting drunk on the first day and urinating in the weight room, and Wiedlin getting upset about the group being asked to brand a cow. Like the season prior, another romance-themed spin-off, &quot;My Fair Brady&quot;, was developed around the romantic escapades of Curry and Knight.

===Season 5===
The fifth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on July 10, 2005, and starred Caprice Bourret, Jose Canseco, Sandy &quot;Pepa&quot; Denton, Janice Dickinson, Carey Hart, Omarosa Manigault, and Bronson Pinchot. This season played up on the show&#x27;s namesake surreality by having the house decorated with a circus/carnival theme and the cast was given circus-style taglines during the introduction. This was enhanced with the introduction of a three-legged dog named Lucky. An ongoing feud between Manigault and Dickinson was a key focus point in the season, which ended with Dickinson leaving the house during the final dinner.

===Season 6===
The sixth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; began airing on March 19, 2006, and starred Alexis Arquette, C.C. DeVille, Steve Harwell, Sherman Hemsley, Maven Huffman, Tawny Kitaen, and Andrea Lowell. Florence Henderson (&quot;Dr. Flo&quot;) assisted the cast as the house therapist. Throughout the two weeks, the cast shot a music video, produced and broadcast a live news program, booked and hosted their own talk-show pilots, and participated in a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; competition. During the talk-show episode, Marla Gibbs makes a cameo appearance with Hemsley, and the two recreate their retorts and putdowns as Florence and George from &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Arquette brings the transgender community increased visibility and awareness with her appearance in the series. And, struggling with memory and enunciation problems that grow worse, Kitaen is inexplicably left crawling on the floor of a closet by the final episode.

===Season 7===
Announced in July 2021, the seventh season starred August Alsina, CJ Perry, Dennis Rodman, Frankie Muniz, Kim Coles, Manny MUA, Stormy Daniels, and Tamar Braxton living together and competing in a series of challenges.

===Season 8===
On September 13, 2023, it was reported that the series would move to MTV for its eighth season, and would star Macy Gray, Chet Hanks, Ally Brooke, O.T. Genasis, Kim Zolciak, Josie Canseco, Johnny Weir, and Tyler Posey, with production scheduled to start that month.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;The Surreal Life&quot; is one of VH1&#x27;s most spun-off shows, with a complex web of reality series which have had spin-off shows themselves. The first spin-off from &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; was &quot;Strange Love&quot;, starring Flavor Flav and Brigitte Nielsen, both of season three. It premiered in January 2005 and ran for 11 episodes. The second spin-off, &quot;My Fair Brady&quot;, starred Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight. It ran its first season in 2005, concluding with the couple&#x27;s engagement. The second season debuted in the spring 2006, concluding with a wedding. The third season premiered on January 20, 2008, and detailed the newlyweds&#x27; lives as they prepared to expand their family.

&quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot; reunited cast members of the original &quot;Surreal Life&quot; series in a competition for cash and prizes.

Pepa received her own two shows stemming from her popularity on VH1. She teamed up with her old partner Cheryl &quot;Salt&quot; James for &quot;The Salt-N-Pepa Show&quot;, which showcased the two distinct personalities clash on many issues from their break-up as a group in the 1990s to their current reformation. The series spanned two seasons. In 2010, Pepa also received her own show on VH1 that documented her search for her Mr. Right, titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Pep&quot;.

===&quot;Of Love&quot; series===
&quot;Strange Love&quot; itself produced a spin-off show, titled &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;, which lasted for three seasons, ending with Flav&#x27;s announcement that he had found his one true love. Due to the show&#x27;s great success, it spawned a successful franchise with &quot;Rock of Love with Bret Michaels.&quot;

====Contestant dating shows====
Some contestants went on to star in their own dating show spinoffs. The first was &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;″s Tiffany Pollard, a.k.a. New York, with &quot;I Love New York&quot; (two seasons). Three of her suitors got their own show: Brothers Kamal &quot;Chance&quot; and Ahmad &quot;Real&quot; Givens starred in &quot;Real Chance of Love&quot; (two seasons) and Frank &quot;The Entertainer&quot; Maresca starred in &quot;Frank the Entertainer in a Basement Affair&quot;.

====Game shows====
Contestants from &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;, &quot;Rock of Love with Bret Michaels&quot;, and &quot;Real Chance of Love&quot; were offered to participate in &quot;Charm School&quot;, which lasted three seasons, with the premise of bettering themselves and a chance at a cash prize.

Contestants from &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;, &quot;Rock of Love&quot;, &quot;I Love New York&quot;, &quot;Real Chance of Love&quot;, &quot;For the Love of Ray J&quot;, &quot;Rock of Love Bus&quot;, &quot;Daisy of Love&quot;, and &quot;Megan Wants a Millionaire&quot; were allowed to take part in &quot;I Love Money&quot;, a &quot;Survivor&quot; elimination-style show held in a Mexican mansion. Four seasons were produced but the third never aired due to the involvement of Ryan Jenkins.

====Unscripted shows====
Contestants New York, Real and Chance later starred in additional unscripted shows. &quot;New York Goes to Hollywood&quot; followed Pollard&#x27;s attempt at becoming an actress, &quot;New York Goes to Work&quot; saw Tiffany Pollard perform various jobs as voted by the viewers on a weekly basis, and &quot;Real and Chance: The Legend Hunters&quot; followed the Givens brothers in their quest to find legendary monsters such as Bigfoot.

<text>Warcraft is a franchise of video games, novels, and other media created by Blizzard Entertainment. The series is made up of six core games: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, and &quot;Warcraft Rumble&quot;. The first three of these core games are in the real-time strategy genre, where opposing players command virtual armies in battle against each other or a computer-controlled enemy. The fourth and best-selling title of the franchise is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), where players control their character and interact with each other in a virtual world.

Expansion sets were released for &quot;Warcraft II&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Dark Portal&quot;), &quot;Warcraft III&quot; (&quot;The Frozen Throne&quot;) and multiple expansions were released for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; (&quot;The Burning Crusade&quot;, &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot;, &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot;, &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot;, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, and &quot;The War Within&quot;). &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;&#x27;s eleventh and twelfth expansions, &quot;Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Last Titan&quot;, were announced in late 2023.

At BlizzCon 2018 on November 2, 2018, Blizzard announced a remaster of &quot;Warcraft III&quot; entitled &quot;Warcraft III: Reforged&quot; featuring remodeled characters and graphics with a prospective release in 2019. The game was officially released on January 28, 2020.

All games in the series have been set in and around the high fantasy world of Azeroth. Initially, the start of the series focused on the human nations that make up the Eastern Kingdoms, and the Orcish Horde, which arrived in Azeroth via a dark portal, beginning the great wars. The Orcs came from another world, referred to as Draenor, the world that will be shattered into pieces by demonic magics during the events of &quot;Warcraft II&quot;, thereafter being known as Outland. Later on in the series the world of Azeroth was expanded, revealing the new continents of Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, Kul Tiras, Zandalar, and the Dragon Isles, allowing the introduction of the Night Elves, Tauren, Pandaren, and other major races into the universe. The world of Azeroth also contains the traditional fantasy setting races of elves, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and trolls. Unusually for the genre, all of these races are available to be played, whereas trolls and full-blooded orcs are usually presented in fantasy fiction as being solely antagonists for protagonists of the more &quot;human-friendly&quot; races.

The series spawned several books and other media, covering a broad range of characters and timelines in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe. A collectible card game was published, which offered those who bought booster packs a chance to gain access codes to limited in-game content in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Comics have been released alongside the books, further covering parts of the universe&#x27;s storyline. A short-lived, online subscription only magazine was available but later ceased publication after five issues. A film adaptation, &quot;Warcraft&quot;, was released in 2016.

==Video games==

The first three games in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series, including their expansion packs, were all released on both the PC and Macintosh. All of these games were of the real-time strategy genre. Each game proceeded to carry on the storyline of the previous games, and each introduced new features and content to improve gameplay. The name &quot;Warcraft&quot; was proposed by Blizzard developer Sam Didier. It was chosen because &quot;it sounded super cool&quot;, according to Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham, without any particular meaning attached to it.

&quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot; was the first game in the series to feature play over the internet using Battle.net, although this was not included until a later release of the game. &quot;Warcraft II&quot; was also the first in the series to be re-released as a &quot;Battle Chest&quot;, a bundled copy of the game containing both the original and expansion. &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; was the first game in the series to feature a Collector&#x27;s Edition, which all subsequent games have released as well. &quot;Warcraft III&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also have both had &quot;Battle Chests&quot; released for them subsequent to their initial release. The &quot;Battle.net&quot; edition of &quot;Warcraft II&quot; was also the first to introduce the use of CD keys to the series, requiring each user online to have their own copy of the game in order to be able to connect.

In 1998, an adventure game in the series, &quot;Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans&quot;, was announced as being canceled, having been previously delayed from a 1997 release.

In 2004, Blizzard Entertainment moved the series away from the real-time strategy genre and released &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Requiring a subscription fee to be paid to play, it also introduced regular additional content to the series in the form of patches. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; gained popularity worldwide, becoming the world&#x27;s largest subscription-based MMORPG in 2008. The game reached a peak 12 million subscribers worldwide in October 2010. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; has had ten expansions as of 2024, with two more announced. During the production of &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;, Blizzard co-founder Frank Pearce stated that &quot;If there&#x27;s a team that&#x27;s passionate about doing another &quot;Warcraft&quot; [real-time strategy], then that&#x27;s definitely something we would consider. It&#x27;s nothing that we&#x27;re working on right now, we have development teams working on &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;, &quot;Diablo III&quot;, and when those teams are all off the projects they&#x27;re working on, they&#x27;ll be intimately involved in the discussions about what&#x27;s next&quot;.

In 2013, Blizzard announced a new free-to-play online digital collectible card game, originally titled &quot;&quot;, with the beta being available in summer of 2013. In March 2014, &quot;Hearthstone&quot; was released. In addition to free-to-play basic gameplay &quot;Hearthstone&quot; contains fee-based features such as additional card packs.

On May 3, 2022, Blizzard announced a new &quot;Warcraft&quot; free-to-play mobile game called &quot;Warcraft Arclight Rumble&quot;.

In 2022, Blizzard and NetEase cancelled an unannounced &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; mobile spin-off game.

On November 3, 2023, Blizzard released the free-to-play mobile tower defense and action strategy game &quot;Warcraft Rumble&quot;. At BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard Entertainment unveiled three forthcoming expansions to &quot;World of Warcraft: The War Within&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Last Titan&quot;. These expansions collectively constitute the Worldsoul saga, a narrative continuum led by Chris Metzen. Blizzard also announced &quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Classic&quot; and confirming their commitment to a more accelerated timeline for future content drops.

===Magazine===
In 2009, Blizzard announced that it would be releasing a magazine with Future US Ltd. This magazine would be purchasable by online subscription, and not for sale in newsagents or stores, making them collector&#x27;s items. The magazine released quarterly, and each contained 148 pages. No advertisements were included in the magazine. In September 2011, Blizzard announced that the magazine was ceasing publication. Refunds, plush toys or in-game pets were given to subscribers depending on the outstanding length of subscription.

===Film adaptation===

In a May 9, 2006 press release, Blizzard Entertainment and Legendary Pictures announced that they would develop a live-action film set in the &quot;Warcraft universe&quot;. At BlizzCon 2008, according to Mike Morhaime, a script was being written.

In January 2013, Duncan Jones was announced to direct the adaptation, from a script by Charles Leavitt. The film was set to begin principal photography in early 2014 with a plot based on the novel &quot;&quot;. On July 20, 2013, Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment unveiled a sizzle reel during their San Diego Comic-Con 2013 panel, with Duncan Jones hopping on stage briefly to discuss the project. Production on the film started shooting on January 13, 2014. The first full-length trailer for the film was released on November 6, 2015. &quot;Warcraft&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on June 6, 2016, and was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on June 10, 2016. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and grossed $439 million worldwide.

===&quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;===
In 2015, Blizzard released &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, a crossover multiplayer online battle arena video game in which players can control various characters from Blizzard&#x27;s franchises as playable heroes, the majority of which come from the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe. The game also features numerous mounts based on mounts or other creatures from &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; as well as a battleground based on the PvP zone Alterac Pass. A number of &quot;Warcraft&quot;-themed skins have been introduced for &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; in the “Echoes of Alterac” event in June 2018. Various soundtracks from &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, such as &quot;Obsidian Sanctum&quot; from &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, &quot;The Wandering Isle&quot; from &quot;Mists of Pandaria,&quot; and &quot;Stormwind&quot; theme, are present as background music in the game. &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; is inspired by &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot;, a community-created mod based on &quot;Warcraft III&quot;.

==Setting==
===Location===
Most of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series takes place on the planet of Azeroth. Other planets in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe include: Draenor (and its sundered remnants, known as Outland), Argus, K&#x27;aresh, Mardum (also known as the Shattered Abyss), Xoroth, Rancora, and Nathreza. There are also several metaphysical areas mentioned, including the Emerald Dream, the Elemental Planes, the Twisting Nether, the Great Dark Beyond, and the Shadowlands. &quot;Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans&quot;, the first game in the series, takes place in Azeroth.

====Azeroth====

Azeroth has four known continents, named the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, and recently rediscovered Pandaria. All continents are separated by the Great Sea. Three major archipelagos also reside in the Great Sea: the Broken Isles; Zandalar, the birthplace of the troll civilization; Kul Tiras, a maritime human nation; and the Dragon Isles, the birthplace of the dragons. In the center of the Great Sea is an enormous, everlasting vortex called the &quot;Maelstrom&quot; beneath which lies the aquatic city of Nazjatar, home of the amphibious Naga. Near the Maelstrom lies the volcanic Isle of Kezan, home of the goblins.

The Eastern Kingdoms are the primary setting of the first two games (and their expansions) and the first half of &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;. It is made up of 22 areas or zones. The kingdom of Stormwind lies at the south of the Eastern Kingdoms, south of the dwarven kingdom of Khaz Modan and north of the jungle known as Stranglethorn Vale. The capital city of Stormwind, Stormwind City, is nestled into the northwest of Elwynn Forest, a large forest at the center of the kingdom. The Dwarven capital in Khaz Modan, called Ironforge, is located in Dun Morogh.

The former human kingdom of Lordaeron, which successfully headed the human Alliance in &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot; but later fell to the Scourge in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos,&quot; is located north of the southern kingdoms. Underneath the ruined city of Lordaeron now lies the Undercity, capital of the Forsaken, a rebel band of the undead Scourge. The area is now known as Tirisfal Glades and is threatened by the Western Plaguelands held back at The Bulwark. Northeast of Lordaeron is the elven nation of Quel&#x27;Thalas and its capital city, Silvermoon, both of which were conquered by the Scourge in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;.

The continent of Kalimdor was introduced in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; and is made up of 18 zones. Whereas the Eastern Kingdoms can be described as the equivalent of medieval Europe, with traditional kingdoms and advanced cities, Kalimdor can be compared to the Americas at the time of the first arrivals of Europeans, full of wild lands. The geography and topography of Kalimdor are similar to North America and Africa, with massive, ancient forests and mountains covering the North and vast deserts and savannahs in the South. The Night Elven kingdom is located in the northwest region of Kalimdor, also including the island Teldrassil (actually a giant tree, similar in lore and spelling to Yggdrasil) off the northwest coast, which contains the city of Darnassus.

To the south, past the Ashenvale Forest, is a stretch of land known as The Barrens, situated between the grasslands of Mulgore to the west, and Durotar, the land settled by the Orcs, to the east. Mulgore is home to the Tauren capital of Thunder Bluff, a large city of tepees and lodges built on top of a conglomerate of high plateaus which are only accessible by air travel and a great series of lifts built down to the ground. In the north of Durotar is the fortress-city of Orgrimmar, the capital of the Orcs.

The third continent, Northrend, is located in the northern polar region of Azeroth and is the primary stronghold of the malevolent Undead Scourge. Northrend is featured in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; and its expansion set &quot;Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne&quot;, and is the main location featured in &quot;World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, the second expansion pack to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

In the expansion &quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm&quot;, Azeroth has been changed permanently in-game, even for players without the expansion set installed. The corrupted Black Dragon Aspect, Deathwing the Destroyer (formerly Neltharion, the Earth-Warder) has broken free from imprisonment in Deepholm, part of the Elemental Plane, and caused major changes and destruction in the land. In addition, many new parts of the continents of Azeroth that have previously been inaccessible have become key parts in the new world.

Lorewise, this is the second major change to the face of Azeroth, the first being the Sundering. The Sundering was caused as a result of the War of the Ancients where demons of the Burning Legion invaded the ancient Kalimdor. It caused a massive explosion that split the one continent into the four seen in-game and created the Maelstrom.

&quot;World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria&quot; was the fourth expansion released and it focuses on the mythical and long-forgotten lands of Pandaria, a continent far to the south that has until now been shrouded in magical mists. It has been inhabited by the Pandarens (a race of humanoid giant pandas). With both factions landing on Pandaria, adventurers rediscover the ancient Pandaren people, whose wisdom will help guide them to new destinies; the Pandaren Empire&#x27;s ancient enemy, the Mantid; and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic Mogu. The storyline for &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; is split into multiple chapters. The story arc that introduces Pandaria—where players discover the continent and level up, helping to solve problems and figure out what happened for the past 10,000 years and why—was included entirely within the initial expansion release. Later chapters in the storyline brought the war between the Horde and the Alliance back into focus, including changing parts of Pandaria (via phasing) to show additional settlements, and eventually returning the players back to Kalimdor for a final showdown, dethroning Warchief Garrosh Hellscream.

&quot;World of Warcraft: Legion&quot; was the sixth expansion released and it focuses on the Broken Isles, a continent and group of islands located northeast of the Maelstrom in the middle of the Great Sea; one of the islands contains the Tomb of the Dark Titan, Sargeras. The Burning Legion has started an invasion of Azeroth and the player characters must find powerful artifacts to stop the invasion. Having thwarted the Burning Legion&#x27;s attempts to invade Azeroth, the players and other significant lore characters traveled to Argus, the homeworld of the Burning Legion, in order to end its threat. While successful, they couldn&#x27;t stop Sargeras entirely. Before being banished and imprisoned, he thrust a magical sword into the surface of Azeroth, leaving the planet wounded and bleeding a magical substance called &quot;Azerite&quot;.

&quot;World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth&quot; was the seventh expansion released and it focuses on the islands of Kul Tiras and Zandalar, two islands which are home to their respective kingdoms. This is the first expansion that introduces two new continents on initial release. During this expansion, the Horde and Alliance seek the aid of the kingdoms of Zandalar and Kul Tiras, respectively, for the reignited war between the factions. Throughout campaigns on both continents, adventurers learn the history of both kingdoms and uncover plots involving the Old Gods. Events influenced by N&#x27;Zoth and his followers lead to the discovery of the continents of Nazjatar, the underwater kingdom of Azshara, and Mechagon, an island inhabited by the Mechagnomes. The final patch of &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot; takes players back to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and Uldum to cure them of the corruption of N&#x27;Zoth, and ultimately face the Old God himself in his empire of Ny&#x27;alotha. The story of &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot; is also the first time players are given choices that can have a significant impact on their own adventures. One significant choice is whether to join the orc Varrok Saurfang in his rebellion against the Horde Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner. Another choice that players are given is whether to become a servant of N&#x27;Zoth. Both choices lead to unique dialogue, cinematics, and quests, depending on the choices made.

The ninth expansion, &quot;World of Warcraft: Dragonflight&quot;, centers around the reappearance of the Dragon Isles, home of the Dragons and their many aspects, including the humanoid Dracthyr. The various Dragon groups and subspecies are referred to as &quot;Dragonflights&quot;, and are all descendants of the original proto-dragons who chose to become empowered by the magic of a race of god-like beings called the Titans. The plot of &quot;Dragonflight&quot; deals with the awakening of the Dracthyr after 20,000 years in response to the threat of Raszageth the Storm-Eater, a &quot;Primalist&quot; proto-dragon who seeks to separate the rest of her kind from the Dragonflights and retake Azeroth for themselves. The Dracthyr are divided into two groups, one that allies with the Alliance and one the Horde, to deal with this threat. Raszageth eventually falls to both groups, but not before she releases her three siblings: Fyrakk the Blazing, Vyranoth the Frozenheart, and Iridikron the Stoneheart.

====Draenor (Outland)====
Draenor, which is featured in &quot;Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal&quot;, is the original homeland of the Orcs and past home of the Draenei.

Draenor was torn apart when the Orcish leader, Ner&#x27;Zhul (later the first Lich King) opened dozens of portals to other worlds in an attempt to escape the invading Alliance Armies from Azeroth. The sheer number and combined power of the portals ripped Draenor into fragments and cast the remainder into the mysterious parallel dimension called the Twisting Nether, Home of the Demons. The remnants of the world are now known as Outland, and feature in the last mission of the human campaign of &quot;Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal&quot; (though, without any actual terrain changes), &quot;Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne&quot; and more prominently in &quot;World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade&quot;.

An intact Draenor is the main feature of the fifth &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; expansion, &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot;, which takes place 35 years earlier in an alternate timeline.

===Major races and factions===
The following races have been sorted into their respective factions:

====The Alliance====
The Alliance has been present in some form in all &quot;Warcraft&quot; games. In all three real-time strategy games, the Alliance are the protagonists of their campaign, and are one of the two main protagonist factions in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. They are also the primary antagonists of &quot;&quot; and the orc campaigns in &quot;Warcraft II&quot;. The Alliance began in &quot;Warcraft II&quot; when the human kingdoms and demihumans strategically united to fend off the conquering Horde. Thus they are enemies to the Horde. The Alliance has evolved over the course of the franchise, losing allies and gaining new members, but the Alliance has endured over the years. They are united to uphold their common noble ideals and are bound together by a sense of brotherhood forged by all the battles they&#x27;ve endured together.

The major races of the Alliance are the humans of Stormwind, the High Elves, the Night Elves of Teldrassil, and the Dwarves of Ironforge. Other races who have joined or allied with the Alliance include the Gnomes of Gnomeregan, the Draenei of Outland, the Dracthyr Obsidian Warders group (a race of dragonoids), the Worgens of Gilneas (creatures that resemble hunched over werewolves), and the Tushui Pandaren.

The Alliance is led by a military commander who coordinates the military actions of all the races in the Alliance. The title for this position depends on the rank of the individual (e.g., Anduin Lothar was a knight and his title was Supreme Allied Commander. Varian Wrynn is a king and his title is High King). This title may require an aspect of diplomacy or has strong political clout as the other leaders can choose not to commit their forces to the commander if they dislike the commander&#x27;s leadership. Though how much forces and resources are contributed to the war effort is left to each individual leader&#x27;s discretion, when the military commander issues a call to arms, all races of the Alliance are expected to contribute.

====The Horde====
In the first two Warcraft games, the Horde is made of the orcs under the command of the Burning Legion and are enemies of the human led Alliance. The orcs attempt in both games to conquer the human kingdoms. Eventually the Horde was defeated, most of its leaders killed, and the orcs placed in internment camps.

The third Warcraft game, Reign of Chaos, details the orcs shaking off both the chains of the Alliance, and the corruption of the Burning Legion. The Horde expanded their ranks by forging alliances with the Blood Elves, the Dracthyr Dark Talons group, the Forsaken, the Goblins, the Huojin Pandaren, the Tauren (which resemble Minotaurs), and the Trolls. The Horde later made alliances with the Highmountain Taurens (a subspecies of the Tauren who possess moose-like antlers after one of their own was earlier blessed by the druid patron Cenarius), the Hozen (a race of monkey-like creatures), the Nightborne elves, the Taunka (a subspecies of Tauren that resemble bison-like Minotaurs), and the Vulpera (a nomadic race of fox-like creatures).

====Burning Legion====
==Reception==
In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Warcraft&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; as number 32 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;While &quot;Warcraft&quot; did not create the realtime strategy genre, it made it appealing to a broad audience. &quot;Warcraft II&quot; went on to refine the genre. Easy to play, nuanced in design, a pleasure to look at, and often a laugh riot, &quot;Warcraft II&quot; was nearly perfect.&quot;

<doc id="780951" wikidata="Q60721" url="?curid=780951" title="Ferdinand II of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Ferdinand II (; 29 October 1816 – 15 December 1885), also known as Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was King of Portugal from 16 September 1837 to 15 November 1853 as the husband and co-ruler of Queen Maria II.

In keeping with Portuguese law, Ferdinand only became king after the birth of his first son, Prince Pedro, in 1837. Ferdinand&#x27;s reign came to an end with the death of his wife in 1853, but he served as regent for his son and successor, King Pedro V, until 1855.

He retained the style and title of king even after the death of Maria II and her succession by their children Pedro V and then Luís I. His sons were reigning kings, while Ferdinand himself was a king-father during their reigns.

==Early life==
Born Ferdinand August Franz Anton in Vienna on 29 October 1816, he was the eldest son of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya, heiress to the House of Koháry. The younger Ferdinand grew up in several places: the family estates in modern-day Slovakia, the imperial court of Austria, and Germany. He was a nephew of King Leopold I of Belgium, and thus a first cousin to Leopold II of Belgium and Empress Carlota of Mexico, as well as Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1826, his title changed from Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, following the re-arrangement of the Saxon duchies.

==King of Portugal==

According to Portuguese law, the husband of a queen regnant could only be titled king after the birth of an heir from that marriage; this was the reason Maria II&#x27;s first husband, Auguste de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, never acquired the title of king. After the birth of their eldest son and heir, the future Pedro V of Portugal, Ferdinand was proclaimed King Dom Fernando II.

Although it was Maria who reigned by right, the royal couple formed an effective team during their joint reign, with Ferdinand reigning by himself during his wife&#x27;s pregnancies.

Eventually, Maria II died as a result of the birth of their eleventh child, and Ferdinand II&#x27;s reign ended. However, he would assume the regency of Portugal from 1853 to 1855, during the minority of his son King Pedro V.

==Later life==

Ferdinand was an intelligent and artistically minded man with modern and liberal ideas. He was adept at etching, pottery and painting aquarelles. He was the president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and the Arts, Lord Protector of the University of Coimbra and Grand-Master of the Rosicrucians.

In 1838, he acquired the former Hieronymite monastery of Our Lady of Pena, which had been built by King Manuel I in 1511 on the top of the hill above Sintra and had been left unoccupied since 1834, when the religious orders were suppressed in Portugal. The monastery consisted of the cloister and its outbuildings, the chapel, the sacristy and the bell tower, which today form the northern section of the Pena National Palace (the &quot;Old Palace&quot;).

Ferdinand began by making repairs to the former monastery, which, according to the historical sources of that time, was in poor condition. He refurbished the whole of the upper floor, replacing the fourteen cells used by the monks with larger-sized rooms and covering them with the vaulted ceilings that can still be seen today. In 1843, the king decided to enlarge the palace by building a new wing (the New Palace) with even larger rooms (one of them being the Great Hall), ending in a circular tower next to the new kitchens. The building work was directed by the Baron von Eschwege, a wild architectural fantasy in an eclectic style full of symbolism that could be compared with the castle Neuschwanstein of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. The palace was built in such a way as to be visible from any point in the park, which consists of a forest and luxuriant gardens with over five hundred different species of trees originating from the four corners of the earth. Ferdinand would spend his last years in this castle with his second wife, receiving the greatest artists of his time.

===Death===
When he was 60, Ferdinand suffered from facial cancer that severely disfigured him and kept him away from public life. On 12 December 1885, due to double vision caused by the tumor, he tripped when going down the stairs to the foyer of the São Carlos Theater, violently hitting his head against a wall and fell into a coma, dying three days after. In his will, he left almost all his assets to his second wife, which caused a public comotion.

He rests next to Mary II, his first wife, in the Pantheon of the House of Braganza, in São Vicente de Fora, Lisbon.

==Marriages and descendants==

On 9 April 1836, Ferdinand married Queen Maria II of Portugal. Eleven children were born to the royal couple before Maria died of complications due to childbirth in 1853. Ferdinand was destined to outlive eight of his eleven children. In late 1861, an attack of cholera or typhoid fever struck the royal family and Ferdinand suffered the tragedy of witnessing the death of three of his five surviving sons.

Later in his life, Ferdinand married again in Lisbon on 10 June 1869 to actress Elisa Hensler (Neuchâtel, 22 May 1836 – Lisbon, Coração de Jesus, 21 May 1929). Just before the marriage, she was styled &quot;Gräfin&quot; (Countess) von Edla by Ferdinand&#x27;s cousin Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The couple had no children.

<doc id="780956" wikidata="Q614454" url="?curid=780956" title="Efrem Zimbalist">
<text>Efrem Zimbalist (April 21 [O.S. April 9], 1889 – February 22, 1985) was a Russian and American concert violinist, composer, conductor and director of the Curtis Institute of Music.

==Early life==
Efrem Zimbalist was born on April 9, 1889, O.S., equivalent to April 21, 1889, in the Gregorian calendar, as reported in many newspaper obituaries, in the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the son of Jewish parents Maria (née Litvinoff) and Aron Zimbalist (Цимбалист, ), who was a conductor. By the age of nine, Efrem Zimbalist was first violin in his father&#x27;s orchestra. At age 12 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and studied under Leopold Auer. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1907 after winning a gold medal and the Rubinstein Prize, and by age 21 was considered one of the world&#x27;s greatest violinists.

==Career==

After graduation he debuted in Berlin (playing the Brahms Concerto) and London in 1907 and in the United States in 1911, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, when he gave the first American performance of the Glazunov Violin Concerto.
In 1912, he played the Glazunov Concerto in a concert marking Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s first appearance with the London Symphony Orchestra. He then settled in the United States. He did much to popularize the performance of classical music in his adopted country. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. He retired as a violinist in 1949, but returned in 1952 to give the first performance of the Violin Concerto by Gian Carlo Menotti. He retired again in 1955. He served as a juror of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1962 and 1966.

Early in his career Zimbalist owned the &quot;Titian&quot; Stradivarius violin. He purchased the violin while on a trip with friend and world renowned violinist Jascha Heifetz for $33,000. At the time, around August 1923, the Titan was 208 years old, being created by Antonio Stradivari in 1715. It was ranked among the four finest violins in the world by European experts. The violin was later purchased by Felix M. Warburg as a quartet purchase that included &quot;Viola Mac Donald&quot; (1701), the &quot;La Belle Blondine&quot;, and a recently restored (at the time) &quot;Red&quot; Stradivari, for $200,000. Mr. Warburg loaned all four to Sascha Jacobsen, Bernard Ocko, and Louis Kaufman, whose teacher was Franz Kneisel, as well as Marie Roemaet-Rosanov, a pupil of the great Pablo Casals, to play at Manhattan&#x27;s Aeolian Hall.

===Curtis Institute===

In 1928, Zimbalist began teaching at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was its director from 1941 to 1968. His pupils included such distinguished musicians as Lynn Blakeslee, Aaron Rosand, Oscar Shumsky, Norman Carol, Toshiya Eto, Joseph Silverstein, Jascha Brodsky, John Dalley, Michael Tree, Felix Slatkin, Shmuel Ashkenasi, Harold Wippler, Leonid Bolotine, Takaoki Sugitani, Helen Kwalwasser, and Hidetaro Suzuki.

===Compositions===
His own compositions include a violin concerto, a piano concerto (1959), the &quot;American Rhapsody&quot;, a tone poem called &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, a Fantasy on themes from &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a Fantasy on Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1936), and a piece called &quot;Sarasateana&quot;, for viola and piano. He also wrote an opera, &quot;Landara&quot;, which premiered in 1956.

=== Dedications ===
Several composers dedicated their works to Zimbalist, including:

* František Drdla&#x27;s &quot;Guitarrero&quot;
* Victor Küzdő&#x27;s &quot;Promenade Grotesque&quot;
* Cyril Scott&#x27;s &quot;Tallahassee&quot;
* Willem Willeke&#x27;s &quot;Chant Sans Paroles&quot;

===Public life===
Pablo Casals writes in his biography, &quot;Joys and Sorrows&quot;, that Zimbalist was a member of the Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, chaired by Casals and founded by him in 1936.

==Personal life==


Zimbalist married the famous American soprano Alma Gluck and they toured together for a time. She died in 1938. In 1943 he married the Curtis Institute of Music&#x27;s founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, daughter of publisher Cyrus Curtis and Louisa Knapp Curtis, and 14 years his senior.

Although he continued to consider himself ethnically Jewish, he found himself attracted, along with his wife Alma, to Anglican Christianity, and they regularly attended the Episcopal Church in New Hartford. Efrem Jr. and Maria were both christened there, and the couple placed Efrem in an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. Efrem Jr. later became active in evangelical circles and was one of the founders of Trinity Broadcasting Network.

He died in 1985, at the age of 95. His and Alma&#x27;s son, Efrem Jr., and their granddaughter, Stephanie Zimbalist, both became popular actors, primarily in television. Efrem Jr. portrayed Dandy Jim Buckley in &quot;Maverick&quot; opposite James Garner, and the lead characters in the television series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and &quot;The FBI&quot;. Granddaughter Stephanie played the female lead in &quot;Remington Steele&quot; opposite Pierce Brosnan.

<text>Software maintenance is the modification of software after delivery.

Software maintenance is often considered lower skilled and less rewarding than new development. As such, it is a common target for outsourcing or offshoring. Usually, the team developing the software is different from those who will be maintaining it. The developers lack an incentive to write the code to be easily maintained. Software is often delivered incomplete and almost always contains some bugs that the maintenance team must fix. Software maintenance often initially includes the development of new functionality, but as the product nears the end of its lifespan, maintenance is reduced to the bare minimum and then cut off entirely before the product is withdrawn.

Each maintenance cycle begins with a change request typically originating from an end user. That request is evaluated and if it is decided to implement it, the programmer studies the existing code to understand how it works before implementing the change. Testing to make sure the existing functionality is retained and the desired new functionality is added often comprises the majority of the maintenance cost.

Software maintenance is not as well studied as other phases of the software life cycle, despite comprising the majority of costs. Understanding has not changed significantly since the 1980s. Software maintenance can be categorized into several types depending on whether it is preventative or reactive and whether it is seeking to add functionality or preserve existing functionality, the latter typically in the face of a changed environment.

==History==
In the early 1970s, companies began to separate out software maintenance with its own team of engineers to free up software development teams from support tasks. In 1972, R. G. Canning published &quot;The Maintenance &#x27;Iceberg, in which he contended that software maintenance was an extension of software development with an additional input: the existing system. The discipline of software maintenance has changed little since then. One twenty-first century innovation has been companies deliberately releasing incomplete software and planning to finish it post-release. This type of change, and others that expand functionality, is often called software evolution instead of maintenance.
==Software life cycle==

Despite testing and quality assurance, virtually all software contains bugs where the system does not work as intended. Post-release maintenance is necessary to remediate these bugs when they are found. Most software is a combination of pre-existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open-source software components with custom-written code. COTS and open-source software is typically updated over time, which can reduce the maintenance burden, but the modifications to these software components will need to be adjusted for in the final product. Unlike software development, which is focused on meeting specified requirements, software maintenance is driven by events—such as user requests or detection of a bug. Its main purpose is to preserve the usefulness of the software, usually in the face of changing requirements.

If conceived of as part of the software development life cycle, maintenance is the last and typically the longest phase of the cycle, comprising 80 to 90 percent of the lifecycle cost. Other models consider maintenance separate from software development, instead as part of the software maintenance life cycle (SMLC). SMLC models typically include understanding the code, modifying it, and revalidating it. 
===Transition from release to maintenance to end of the lifespan===

Frequently, software is delivered in an incomplete state. Developers will test a product until running out of time or funding, because they face fewer consequences for an imperfect product than going over time or budget. The transition from the development to the maintenance team is often inefficient, without lists of known issues or validation tests, which the maintenance team will likely recreate. After release, members of the development team are likely to be reassigned or otherwise become unavailable. The maintenance team will require additional resources for the first year after release, both for technical support and fixing defects left over from development. 

Initially, software may go through a period of enhancements after release. New features are added according to user feedback. At some point, the company may decide that it is no longer profitable to make functional improvements, and restrict support to bug fixing and emergency updates. Changes become increasingly difficult and expensive due to lack of expertise or decaying architecture due to software aging. After a product is no longer maintained, and does not receive even this limited level of updating, some vendors will seek to extract revenue from the software as long as possible, even though the product is likely to become increasingly avoided. Eventually, the software will be withdrawn from the market, although it may remain in use. During this process, the software becomes a legacy system.

===Change cycle ===
The first step in the change cycle is receiving a change request from a customer and analyzing it to confirm the problem and decide whether to implement the change. This may require input from multiple departments; for example, the marketing team can help evaluate whether the change is expected to bring more business. Software development effort estimation is a difficult problem, including for maintenance change requests, but the request is likely to be declined if it is too expensive or infeasible. If it is decided to implement the request, it can be assigned to a scheduled release and implemented. Although agile methodology does not have a maintenance phase, the change cycle can be enacted as a scrum sprint. 

Understanding existing code is an essential step before modifying it. The rate of understanding depends both on the code base as well as the skill of the programmer. Following coding conventions such as using clear function and variable names that correspond to their purpose makes understanding easier. Use of conditional loop statements only if the code could execute more than once, and eliminating code that will never execute can also increase understandability. Experienced programmers have an easier time understanding what the code does at a high level. Software visualization is sometimes used to speed up this process. 

Modification to the code may take place in any way. On the one hand, it is common to haphazardly apply a quick fix without being granted enough time to update the code documentation. On the other hard structured iterative enhancement can begin by changing the top-level requirements document and propagating the change down to lower levels of the system. Modification often includes code refactoring (improving the structure without changing functionality) and restructuring (improving structure and functionality at the same time). Unlike commercial software, free and open source software change cycles are largely restricted to coding and testing, with minimal documentation. Open-source software projects instead rely on mailing lists and a large number of contributors to understand the code base and fix bugs efficiently.

An additional problem with maintenance is that nearly every change to code will introduce new bugs or unexpected ripple effects, which require another round of fixes. Testing can consume the majority of maintenance resource for safety-critical code, due to the need to revalidate the entire software if any changes are made. Revalidation may include code review, regression testing with a subset of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests. The goal of the testing is to verify that previous functionality is retained, and the new functionality has been added. 

==Categories of software maintenance==
The key purpose of software maintenance is ensuring that the product continues to meet usability requirements. At times, this may mean extending the product&#x27;s capabilities beyond what was initially envisioned.

According to the ISO/IEC 14764 specification, software maintenance can be classified into four types:
* Corrective maintenance: modification of software to fix a bug or other failure to meet requirements, typically reported by an end user.
* Preventive maintenance: forward-looking modification of software after delivery to ensure it continues to meet requirements or fix problems that have not manifested yet. This type of maintenance is performed especially on systems that are required to be highly safe or available. Software rejuvenation is one form of preventative maintenance to clean up state and prevent future problems.
* Adaptive maintenance: modification of software performed after delivery to ensure its continuing usability in a changed or changing environment.
* Perfective maintenance: enhancement of software after delivery to improve qualities such as user experience, processing efficiency, and maintainability. Perfective maintenance is necessary if other types of maintenance are carried out, because modification of an existing code base will otherwise increase complexity and cause the existing structure to deteriorate. Perfective maintenance may include rewriting documentation, code refactoring, and performance tuning.
According to some estimates, enhancement (the latter two categories) comprises some 80 percent of software maintenance.
==Maintainability==

Maintainability is the quality of software enabling it to be easily modified without breaking existing functionality. According to the ISO/IEC 14764 specification, activity to ensure software maintainability prior to release counts as part of software maintenance. Many software development organizations neglect maintainability, even though doing so will increase long-term costs. Technical debt is incurred when programmers, often out of laziness or urgency to meet a deadline, choose quick and dirty solutions rather than build maintainability into their code. A common cause is underestimates in software development effort estimation, leading to insufficient resources allocated to development. One important aspect is having a large amount of automated software tests that can detect if existing functionality is compromised by a change. 

A challenge with maintainability is that many software engineering courses do not emphasize it, and give out one-and-done assignments that have clear and unchanging specifications. Software engineering courses do not cover systems as complex as occur in the real world. Development engineers who know that they will not be responsible for maintaining the software do not have an incentive to build in maintainability.

==Workforce==
Maintenance is often considered an unrewarding job for software engineers, who, if assigned to maintenance, were more likely to quit. It often pays less than a comparable job in software development. The task is often assigned to temporary workers or lesser-skilled staff, although maintenance engineers are also typically older than developers, partly because they must be familiar with outdated technologies. In 2008, around 900,000 of the 1.3 million software engineers and programmers working in the United States were doing maintenance.

Companies started separate teams for maintenance, which led to outsourcing this work to a different company, and by the turn of the twenty-first century, sometimes offshoring the work to another country—whether as part of the original company or a separate entity. The typical sources of outsourcing are developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, while destinations are usually lower-cost countries such as China, India, Russia, and Ireland. Reasons for offshoring include taking advantage of lower labor costs, enabling around-the-clock support, reducing time pressure on developers, and to move support closer to the market for the product. Downsides of offshoring include communication barriers in the form of such factors as time zone and organizational disjunction and cultural differences. Despite many employers considering maintenance lower-skilled work and the phase of software development most suited to offshoring, it requires close communication with the customer and rapid response, both of which are hampered by these communication difficulties. 

==Alternatives to maintenance==
In software engineering, the term legacy system does not have a fixed meaning, but often refers to older systems which are large, difficult to modify, and also necessary for current business needs. Often legacy systems are written in obsolete programming languages, lack documentation, have a deteriorating structure after years of changes, and depend on experts to keep it operational. When dealing with these systems, at some point so much technical debt accumulates that maintenance is not practical or economical. Other choices include:
*Freezing—do no more work on the legacy system. This option may be chosen if the vendor wants to continue to extract revenue as long as possible while avoiding maintenance costs.
*Outsourcing functionality of the legacy system to a different company, especially if it is not considered a core business function.
*Discarding the existing legacy system and redeveloping a new application from scratch to fulfill the same purpose as the legacy system. However, this approach is inefficient due to discarding a working system, and with this approach there is a danger that the new system will not fulfill changing business requirements.
*Wrapping the legacy application in an abstraction layer to simplify outdated interfaces. The source code is not modified but the new interface allows a tried and tested component to be accessed by newer applications. This approach does not fix any of the issues with maintaining a legacy system. Databases, functions, and entire applications may be wrapped in this way.
*Migrating the legacy system to a new platform, which can reduce the expense of new software development by reusing the implementation, design, specification, and requirements of the legacy system. Migration can take 5 to 10 years, but results in greater flexibility and long-term savings in software maintenance. As much as 80 percent of the expense is in testing; that is, ensuring that the new system has the same output as the old system. After the new system is finished, there needs to be a transition from the old system to the new system with minimum disruption to business functions.

==Research==
Despite taking up the lion&#x27;s share of software development resources, maintenance is the least studied phase of software development. Much of the literature has focused on how to develop maintainable code from the outset, with less focus on motivating engineers to make maintainability a priority. , automated solutions for code refactoring to reduce maintenance effort are an active area of research, as is machine-learning enhanced maintainability assessment.

<text>Samuel Freedman, (16 April 1908 – 6 March 1993), was a Canadian lawyer and judge, who served as Chief Justice of Manitoba from 1971 to 1983.

==Personal life and education==

Born on 16 April 1908, to Nathan and Ada (Foxman) Freedman in Zhytomyr, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), Freedman moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, when he was three years old. He lived with his family in Winnipeg&#x27;s north end, attending Aberdeen School and St. John&#x27;s Technical High School.

In 1934, Freedman married Brownie Udow. The two were parents to Martin Freedman, a former Justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal whose first judicial appointment was to a position once held by his father.

=== University education and activities ===

Freedman earned a scholarship that allowed him to enter the 5-year arts program at the University of Manitoba in 1924. He earned five scholarships during the course of his university career. With his studies focused on the subjects of Latin and Greek, he planned to pursue his study of the classics had he been awarded the Rhodes Scholarship in 1928. Instead, he pursued his second choice—law—thereby entering the Manitoba Law School in 1929.

At that time, legal education in Manitoba comprised two parts—classes at the law school (which was located in the downtown courthouse) and practical training with practicing lawyers. Freedman completed his practicum with the firm of Steinkopf and Lawrence, a partnership of Winnipeg lawyers Max Steinkopf and W. D. Lawrence.

==== Extra-curriculars ====
During his time at university, Freedman was also involved with the Jewish club on campus, known as the Menorah Society. He also served as editor of the University of Manitoba yearbook, the Brown and Gold, in 1929–1930 (during his first year of law school).

Freedman was also a skilled public speaker and enjoyed participating in debates, which likely helped hone his oratorical skills. He was an active debater at St. John&#x27;s High School, and continued to debate in university through his involvement with the Debating Union. In November 1930, he participated in the Imperial Debate with Andrew Stewart, Trevor Lloyd and John Mitchell. That year, he also won the McGoun Coup for Manitoba, partnered with W. L. Morton. After graduation, he remained active with the Debating Union, as well as the League of Nations Society.

==Career==

Freedman received his call to the bar in 1933, then joined Steinkopf &amp; Lawrence in practice, where he became a partner in 1935. In later years, he acknowledged the influence of criminal law practitioners R. A. Bonner and A. J. Andrews and civil litigators Isaac Pitblado, A. E. Hoskin, W. Parker Fillmore, R. D. Guy, and E. K. Williams as being important to his development as a lawyer.

In 1941, Freedman was elected to the executive of the Manitoba Bar Association (MBA), representing the Eastern Judicial District. In 1942, he became the editor of the &quot;Manitoba Bar News&quot;, a position he held for 4 years.

In 1944, he was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel. Shortly thereafter, he formed a new law partnership with David Golden. In 1951, Freedman was elected President of the MBA, becoming the first Jewish lawyer in the province to hold the position. In April 1952, Freedman was appointed to the Manitoba Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, and as result, dissolved his firm with Golden.

Moreover, Freedman was Chairman of the Rhodes Scholarship Selections Committee from 1956 to 1966.

In March 1960, Freedman was elevated to the Manitoba Court of Appeal. A decade later, in 1971, upon the retirement of Chief Justice Smith, he took over the position of Chief Justice of Manitoba and remained in that position until his retirement at age 75 on 16 April 1983.

In 1964, Freedman was called upon to conduct an inquiry and public hearings into a railway workers&#x27; dispute regarding technological changes. The Freedman Commission issued its report in early December 1965.

On 25 June 1984, Freedman was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada by the Governor General of Canada, Jeanne Sauvé. He has also received numerous honorary degrees.

The following quotation has been attributed to Freedman:
They say that during the first five years every judge delivers his judgment with a lurking suspicion in his mind that he is wrong. During the next five years he delivers every judgment absolutely convinced that he is right. Thereafter he delivers his judgments with a growing indifference as to whether he is right or wrong. And they say that when the indifference becomes habitual, he should retire.
== Philanthropy ==
Freedman served as president of the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association, and was active with the Winnipeg committee in support of the Hebrew University, and with the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. He later served as President of the Manitoba chapter of Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University until 1969. In 1978, on his 70th birthday, Freedman was honoured with the establishment of a chair in legal advocacy at the Faculty of Law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

In 1941, Freedman became a part-time lecturer with the Manitoba Law School, teaching civil procedure, agency, partnership and, later, family law. He held this post until his appointment as Chancellor of the university in June 1959, which required him to give up his teaching position. He remained Chancellor of the university until 1968.

<text>Joybubbles ( – ), born Josef Carl Engressia Jr. in Richmond, Virginia, was an early phone phreak. Born blind, he became interested in telephones at age four. He had absolute pitch, and was able to whistle 2600 hertz into a telephone, an operator tone also used by blue box phreaking devices. Joybubbles said that he had an IQ of &quot;172 or something&quot;. Joybubbles died at his Minneapolis home on . According to his death certificate, he died of natural causes with congestive heart failure as a contributing condition.

==Whistler==
As a five-year-old, Joybubbles discovered he could dial phone numbers by clicking the hang-up switch rapidly (&quot;tapping&quot;), and at the age of 7 he accidentally discovered that whistling at certain frequencies could activate phone switches.

A student at the University of South Florida in the late 1960s, he was given the nickname &quot;Whistler&quot; due to his ability to place free long-distance phone calls by whistling the proper tones with his mouth. After a Canadian operator reported him for selling such calls for $1 at the university, he was suspended and fined $25 but soon reinstated. He later graduated with a degree in philosophy and moved to Tennessee.

==Later life==

In 1982, he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. He lived on his Social Security disability pension and a job as a test subject for scent-intensity research. He was an ordained minister of his own Church of Eternal Childhood, and ran a one-man nonprofit support organization for people rediscovering and re-experiencing childhood, called &quot;We Won&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;. He tried to remain an active member of the children&#x27;s community around his home, giving readings at the local library and setting up phone calls to terminally ill children around the world. He often contributed to the Bulletin Board section of the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; newspaper.

Sexually abused as a child by one of his teachers, Joybubbles &quot;reverted to his childhood&quot; in May 1988 and remained there until his death, claiming that he was five years old. He legally changed his name to Joybubbles in 1991, stating that he wanted to put his past, specifically the abuse, behind him. He was listed in the local phone directory as &quot;Joybubbles, I Am&quot;.

An avid fan of Mister Rogers, Joybubbles was mentioned in a November 1998 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine article about children&#x27;s television host Fred Rogers. In the summer of 1998, Joybubbles traveled to the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; Archives and watched several hundred episodes over a span of six weeks.

An active amateur radio operator with the call sign WB0RPA, he held an amateur extra class license, the highest grade issued. As shown in the Federal Communications Commission database, he also earned both a General radiotelephone operator license and a commercial radiotelegraph operator&#x27;s license, as well as a ship radar endorsement on these certificates. He was one of the few to qualify for the now-obsolete aircraft radiotelegraph endorsement on the latter license.

==Presence in the media==
* In 1971, just after his arrest, Joybubbles was featured in an &quot;Esquire&quot; article by Ron Rosenbaum (&quot;Secrets of the Little Blue Box&quot;) which exposed the phone phreak scene to a general public and led to further media coverage of Joybubbles, who became a cultural icon.
* The 1992 movie &quot;Sneakers&quot; had a character called &quot;Whistler&quot;, who seemed to combine traits of both Joybubbles and John Draper. The character is played by David Strathairn.
* The 2001 documentary film &quot;The Secret History of Hacking&quot; features archive footage of Joybubbles.
* In Steve Wozniak&#x27;s book &quot;iWoz&quot;, Steve Wozniak mentions Joybubbles as an early inspiration during his college years.
* On February 21, 2012, WNYC&#x27;s &quot;Radiolab&quot; aired a segment on Joybubbles in an episode titled &quot;Escape!&quot;
* Chapter 9 of the book &quot;Exploding the Phone&quot; by Phil Lapsley details his successful plan to get a job by purposely getting arrested for phreaking.
* Phone phreaking and specifically Joybubbles were the subject of &quot;A Call from Joybubbles&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, on March 13, 2017 and March 17, 2018.

==Phone services==
Joybubbles ran a weekly telephone story line called &quot;Stories and Stuff&quot;, which was usually updated at the weekend.

In the early and mid-1980s, he ran a phone line called the &quot;Zzzzyzzerrific Funline&quot;, which had the distinction of being the very last entry in the phone book. During the Zzzzyzzerrific Funline days, calling himself Highrise Joe, he would go on various rants about how much he loved Valleyfair amusement park and would also regularly play and discuss Up with People.9201664299 hacking.com

<doc id="780977" wikidata="Q84239" url="?curid=780977" title="Maria Leopoldina of Austria">
<text>Dona Maria Leopoldina of Austria (22 January 1797 – 11 December 1826) was the first Empress of Brazil as the wife of Emperor Dom Pedro I from 12 October 1822 until her death. She was also Queen of Portugal during her husband&#x27;s brief reign as King Dom Pedro IV from 10 March to 2 May 1826.

She was born in Vienna, Austria, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Among her many siblings were Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte.

The education Maria Leopoldina had received in childhood and adolescence was broad and eclectic, with a higher cultural level and more consistent political training. Such education of the little princes and princesses of the Habsburg family was based on the educational belief initiated by their grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who believed &quot;that children should be inspired from an early age to have high qualities, such as humanity, compassion and the desire to make people happy&quot;. With a deep Christian faith and a solid scientific and cultural background (which included international politics and notions of government) the Archduchess had been prepared from an early age to being a proper royal consort.

In the 21st century, it has been proposed by some historians that she was one of the main articulators of the process of Independence of Brazil that took place in 1822. Her biographer, historian Paulo Rezzutti, maintains that it was largely thanks to her that Brazil became a nation. According to him, the wife of Dom Pedro &quot;embraced Brazil as her country, Brazilians as her people and Independence as her cause&quot;. She was also adviser to Dom Pedro on important political decisions that reflected the future of the nation, such as the &quot;Dia do Fico&quot; and the subsequent opposition and disobedience to the Portuguese courts regarding the couple&#x27;s return to Portugal. Consequently, for governing the country on Dom Pedro&#x27;s trips through the Brazilian provinces, she is considered the first woman to become head of state in an independent American country.

==Early years==
===Birth and parentage===

Maria Leopoldina was born on 22 January 1797 at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria. She was the sixth (but third surviving) child of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor (who from 1804, became Emperor of Austria with the title of Francis I, because Napoleon Bonaparte demanded that he renounce the title of Holy Roman Emperor when he was crowned Emperor of the French) but the fifth (third surviving) child and fourth (second surviving) daughter born from his second marriage with Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Her paternal grandparents were Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Luisa of Bourbon, Infanta of Spain and her maternal grandparents were King Ferdinand IV &amp; III of Naples and Sicily (later King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies) and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria. Through both parents (who are double first-cousins), Maria Leopoldina was descended from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (one of the oldest and most powerful dynasties in Europe, which reigned over Austria from 1282 to 1918, among other territories that reigned and was the oldest reigning house in Europe at the time of Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s birth) and from the House of Bourbon (a royal dynasty who at the time of her birth reigned over Spain, Naples, Sicily and Parma; the main branch of the family, who reigned in France since 1589, was dethroned after the French Revolution in 1792 but briefly restored during 1814–1830). 
She was given the name &quot;Caroline Josepha Leopoldine Franziska Ferdinanda&quot;, according to her main biographer Carlos H. Oberacker Júnior in his work &quot;A Imperatriz Leopoldina: Sua Vida e Sua Época&quot;, and confirmed by Bettina Kann in her work &quot;Cartas de uma Imperatriz&quot; and other authors. In one of the essays presented in his work, Oberacker Júnior showed an excerpt of the publication made by the Austrian newspaper &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot; on 25 January 1797, who gave the news of the birth of the Archduchess three days before with her full name; he also mentioned that the name &quot;Maria&quot; wasn&#x27;t present in the preserved baptismal record of the Archduchess, which is in fact true. According to Oberacker Júnior, the Archduchess started using it already on his trip to Brazil, when dealing with some private businesses. In Brazil, she started to sign only Leopoldina, or using the first name Maria, as can be seen in her oath to the Constitution of Brazil in 1822. According to another theory presented by Oberacker Júnior, the Archduchess probably began to use the name &quot;Maria&quot; due to her great devotion to the Virgin Mary and to invoke her protection, and also because all her sisters-in-law used this name.

Maria Leopoldina was born during a turbulent period in European history. In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte became First Consul of France, and later became Emperor. He then began a series of conflicts and established systems of alliances known as &quot;Coalitions&quot; over Europe that frequently redefined the continent&#x27;s borders. Austria was an active participant in all of the Napoleonic Wars, against France, her historical enemy. Napoleon shook the old European royal institutions, and fierce battles began through the Holy Roman Empire. Her older sister, Archduchess Maria Ludovika, married Napoleon in 1810, seeking to strengthen the ties between France and Austria. This union was undoubtedly one of the most serious defeats of the House of Habsburg; their maternal grandmother, Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily (who deeply hated everything about France after execution of her beloved sister Queen Marie Antoinette in 1793), grunted with her son-in-law&#x27;s attitude: &quot;It was precisely what I lacked, to now become the devil&#x27;s grandmother&quot;.

===Education===
On 13 April 1807, the 10-year-old Archduchess lost her mother after she suffered complications due to childbirth. A year later (6 January 1808), her father remarried to the woman Maria Leopoldina would later describe as the most important person in her life, Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este.

First-cousin of her husband and granddaughter of Empress Maria Theresa, the new Empress was well-educated and surpassed her predecessor in culture and intellectual brilliance. Muse and personal friend of the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, she was responsible for the intellectual formation of her stepdaughter, developing in Maria Leopoldina a taste for literature, nature and music by Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Because she had no children of her own, she willingly adopted those of her predecessor; Maria Leopoldina always considered her stepmother to be her mother and she grew up with Empress Maria Ludovika as her &quot;spiritual mother&quot;. Thanks to her, the Archduchess had the chance of meeting Goethe in 1810 and 1812, when she went to Carlsbad with her stepmother.

Maria Leopoldina was raised according to the three Habsburg principles: discipline, piety and sense of duty. Her childhood was marked by a strict education, diverse cultural stimulation and successive wars that threatened her father&#x27;s domains. She and her siblings were raised in accordance with the educational principles laid down by their grandfather, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, who preached equality between men, treating everyone with courtesy, the need to practise charity, and above all, the sacrifice of their own desires for the needs of the State. Among these principles was the habit of exercising their handwriting by writing the following text:
The study program for Maria Leopoldina and her siblings included subjects such as reading, writing, dance, drawing, painting, piano, riding, hunting, history, geography and music; and in an advanced module, mathematics (arithmetic and geometry), literature, physics, singing and crafts. From an early age, Maria Leopoldina showed a greater inclination towards the disciplines of natural sciences, being mainly interested in botany and mineralogy. The Archduchess also inherited the habit of collecting from her father: she began collections of coins, plants, flowers, minerals and shells. Between October and December 1816, she was successful in quickly learning the Portuguese language; by December, the Archduchess was already speaking fluently with Portuguese diplomats, and lived &quot;surrounded by maps of Brazil and books containing the History of this Kingdom, or Memories related to it&quot;. Language learning was part of the family formation, and Leopoldina became a notorious polyglot, speaking 7 languages: her native German, as well as Portuguese, French, Italian, English, Greek and Latin.

Leopoldina and her siblings were taken on frequent visits to museums, botanical gardens, factories and agricultural fields. And, not infrequently, they participated in dances, performed in plays and played instruments for an audience, with the intention of getting the children used to ceremonies and public exposure. The Habsburg Archudukes and Archduchesses were encouraged to attend the theatre in order to develop public speaking abilities, greater articulation and oratory skills.

==Negotiations and Marriage==
For centuries, royal marriages in Europe served primarily as political alliances. Through marriage, the geopolitical cartography of the European continent was shaped by a complex web of shared interests and solidarity between royal houses. The marriage between Maria Leopoldina and Dom Pedro de Alcântara, Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, was a strategic alliance between the monarchies of Portugal and Austria. With this union, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine fulfilled the famous motto: &quot;Bella gerant alii, tu, felix Austria, nube&quot; (&quot;Let others wage war, thou, happy Austria, marry&quot;).

On 24 September 1816, it was announced by Emperor Francis I that Dom Pedro de Alcântara, wished to take a Habsburg Archduchess as his wife. Prince Klemens von Metternich suggested that it should be Maria Leopoldina to go get married, as it was &quot;her turn&quot; to become a wife. The Marquis of Marialva played an enormous role in the wedding negotiations, the same one who had negotiated, advised by Alexander von Humboldt, the coming to Brazil of the French Artistic Mission. King John VI did everything to include the Infanta Dona Isabel Maria (who would be regent of the Kingdom of Portugal from 1826 to 1828 and would die unmarried) in the negotiations. The Marquis of Marialva made a guarantee that the Portuguese royal family was determined to return to the continent as soon as Brazil demonstrated that it had surely &quot;escaped the flames of the wars of independence that were advancing in the Spanish colonies&quot;, thus obtaining Austrian consent to marriage. Once this was secured, the contract was signed in Vienna on 29 November 1816.

Two ships were prepared, and in April 1817, scientists, painters, gardeners and a taxidermist, all with assistants, travelled to Rio de Janeiro ahead of Maria Leopoldina, who, in the meantime, studied the history and geography of her future home and learned Portuguese. During these weeks, the Archduchess compiled and wrote a vade mecum, a unique document the like of which has never been produced by any other Habsburg princess.

The marriage &quot;per procuram&quot; (by proxy) between Maria Leopoldina and Dom Pedro took place on 13 May 1817 at the Augustinian Church in Vienna. The groom was represented by the bride&#x27;s uncle, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen.

Through this marriage, King John VI saw the opportunity to counteract the excessive influence of England in its domains by forging new alliances with traditional dynasties. Austria, on the other hand, saw the new Portuguese-Brazilian Empire as an important transatlantic ally that fit perfectly with the reactionary, absolutist ideals of the Holy Alliance. In this way, the marriage was a purely political act, not a sentimental one.

==From Austria to the New World and the Scientific Mission==
===The crossing of the Atlantic===

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s trip to Brazil was difficult and time-consuming. The Archduchess left Vienna for Florence on 2 June 1817, where she awaited further instructions from the Portuguese court, since monarchical authority remained tenuous in Brazil since the Pernambucan revolt.

On 13 August 1817, Maria Leopoldina was finally allowed to embark on her journey from Livorno, Italy, on the Portuguese fleet composed of the ships &quot;D. João VI&quot; and &quot;São Sebastião&quot;. With her luggage and a large entourage, she faced 86 days of crossing the waters of the Atlantic. Forty boxes the height of a man contained her trousseau, books, collections and gifts for the future family. She brought also an impressive household: court ladies, a chambermaid, a butler, six ladies-in-waiting, four pages, six Hungarian nobles, six Austrian guards, six chamberlains, a chief Almoner, a chaplain, a private secretary, a doctor, a performer, a mineralogist and her painting teacher. The Archduchess definitively parted for Brazil two days later, on 15 August. The differences in habits and customs, already noticed in the period since she embarked, foreshadowed the difficulties that she would face in Rio de Janeiro. The first time she set foot on Portuguese territory, however, it was not on Brazilian land, but on Madeira Island, on 11 September.
On 5 November 1817, Maria Leopoldina arrived to Rio de Janeiro, where she finally met her husband and his family. The next day, the official marriage ceremony took place at the &quot;Capela Real&quot; of Rio de Janeiro Cathedral amidst celebrations all over the city.
Upon her arrival, the physical appearance of Maria Leopoldina surprised the Portuguese royal family, who were awaiting a beautiful Archduchess. Instead, she was overweight, though with a beautiful face. However, she was also extraordinarily cultured for her time, with a keen interest in botany. The arrival provided Jean-Baptiste Debret with an occasion for his first commission, where he had 12 days to decorate the city. He had a studio in the Catumbi neighborhood, where as a naturalist, he later made drawings of plants and flowers for Maria Leopoldina. He would say: &quot;I was in charge of graciously executing some drawings for her that she dared to ask for&quot;, he said, &quot;in the name of his sister, former Empress of the French &quot;. In his atelier, Debret designed the great gala uniforms of the court, in green and gold, the decorations of the new state, and previously designed the crown created by Napoleon in 1806 for the Kingdom of Italy. Debret also designed the insignia of the Order of the Southern Cross, comparable to the Medal of the Legion of Honor, and years later he also designed the Imperial Order of the Rose, instituted in honor of Dom Pedro&#x27;s second wife, Amélie of Leuchtenberg.

From a distance, the Portuguese Royal Prince initially appeared to his new wife as a perfect, well-educated gentleman, but the reality was very different. Dom Pedro was a year younger than Maria Leopoldina and rarely measured up to the descriptions she had been given by the matchmakers. His temperament was impulsive and choleric, and his education modest. Even spoken communication between the young married couple proved difficult, as Pedro spoke very little French and his Portuguese could only be described as vulgar. In addition, keeping with Portuguese tradition, the 18-year-old Dom Pedro not only had a string of amorous adventures behind him and was principally interested in horse racing and love affairs, but by the time of his marriage he was living as if in wedlock with French dancer Noemie Thierry, who was finally removed from the court by his father a month after Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s arrival in Rio de Janeiro.

The young married couple took up residence in six relatively small rooms in the Palace of São Cristóvão. The inner courtyard and path to the stables were unpaved and the tropical rainfall quickly turned everything to mud. There were insects everywhere, including in their clothing, for the uniforms and court regalia made of velvet and plush rotted and turned mouldy in the heat and humidity. The Prince von Metternich would intercept a letter from the Baron von Eschwege to his partner in Vienna in which he said: &quot;Speaking of the Crown Prince, since he is not without natural intelligence, he is lacking in formal education. He was raised among horses, and the princess sooner or later you will realize that he is not able to coexist in harmony. Furthermore, the court of Rio is very boring and insignificant, compared to the courts of Europe&quot;.

In the wake of Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s arrival, the first wave of immigrants arrived in Brazil; Swiss settlers who settled in the vicinity of the court, founding Nova Friburgo and settling in the future Petrópolis, the later Imperial summer residence. From 1824, due to the Brazilian campaign in Europe organized by Major Georg Anton Schäffer, the Germans arrived more numerous and settled again in Nova Friburgo and in the temperate regions of the provinces of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, where the colony of São Leopoldo was created in the new Royal Princess&#x27;s honour. Some from Pomerania went to Espírito Santo, living until the 1880s in such complete isolation that they didn&#x27;t even speak Portuguese.

===Austrian Scientific Mission===

Brazil had the privilege of being portrayed and studied by European artists and scientists of the first order long before other American countries. Still in the 17th century, in the context of the Dutch occupation of northeastern Brazil, Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen brought to Brazil a significant group of collaborators, among which we can mention Willem Piso, a doctor who came to study tropical diseases; Frans Post, famous painter, then in his early twenties; Albert Eckhout, also a painter; cartographer Cornelius Golijath; the astronomer Georg Marggraf, who, with Piso, would be the author of &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot; (Amsterdam, 1648), the first scientific work on Brazilian nature. The Prince of Nassau-Siegen was also concerned with perpetuating the political events of his administration, entrusting Caspar Barlaeus with a history of his government in Brazil.

Once the Dutch were expelled, the Portuguese became aware that the recovery of the territory was the result of a series of happy circumstances, which could no longer be repeated, in the event of a new invasion of the territory of Portuguese America. In view of this situation, Portugal has taken the policy of the State to prohibit the access of its overseas possessions to any and all foreigners, even prohibiting the publication of any news or reference to American lands. This State policy was effectively followed by several generations, from the middle of the 17th century until the arrival of the royal family to Brazil and the consequent opening of Brazil to the world, symbolized by the Decree of Opening Ports to Friendly Nations (&quot;Decreto de Abertura dos Portos às Nações Amigas&quot;), first act signed by Prince Regent John, during his stay in Salvador, in 1808.

The opening of the ports and the consequent revocation of the ban on the landing of foreigners in Brazilian lands, which coincided with a difficult time for European naturalists, as their transit through Europe was significantly hampered by the Napoleonic Wars, coupled with the lack of knowledge about this immense portion of the globe&#x27;s territory, aroused enormous scientific interest in Europe. Parallel to this world context, Maria Leopoldina, since her first youth (around 14 years old), started to show a special interest in the natural sciences, especially in geology and botany. This fact did not go unnoticed by her teachers and by her father, Emperor Francis I of Austria, who surprised the young Archduchess&#x27;s interests (they thought it would be more natural for such inclinations to arise in one of her brothers), but did nothing to hinder the young Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s studies.

Therefore, in 1817, when the forthcoming announcement of the wedding of Maria Leopoldina and Dom Pedro, immediately was organized, under the auspices of the Austrian court, (but also integrated by Bavarian scientists) what would become the main scientific expedition into the unknown (for science) Brazilian lands.

In 1815 King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria was already planning a great scientific expedition through South America, but some setbacks occurred and the expedition was not carried out. So when in 1817 Maria Leopoldina embarked to Brazil for her wedding with Dom Pedro, the Bavarian sovereign took the opportunity and sent two of his subjects: Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, doctor and botanist, and Johann Baptist von Spix, zoologist, with the retinue of the Archduchess.

In addition to these, Karl von Schreibers, Director of the Natural History Museum, under orders from Chancellor Prince von Metternich, prepared a mission with notable scientists who would accompany the Archduchess&#x27;s entourage. Among the scientists were: Johann Christof Mikan, a botanist and entomologist; Johann Emanuel Pohl, physician, mineralogist and botanist; Johann Buchberger, flora painter; Johann Natterer, zoologist; Thomas Ender, painter; Heinrich Schott, gardener; and the Italian naturalist Giuseppe Raddi, this group aimed to collect specimens and make illustrations of people and landscapes for a museum to be founded in Vienna.

The greatest interest was to trace the New World by researching plants, animals and Indians. All this fascination was due to the publication of the first volume of the book by the German geographer Alexander von Humboldt, &quot;Le voyage aux régions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent, fait en 1799–1804&quot; (&quot;The voyage to the equinoctial regions of the New Continent, made in 1799–1804&quot;) and Aimé Bonpland. Humboldt influenced several artists, for example Johann Moritz Rugendas, and the striking feature of his research, as well as that of Humboldtian artists, was to represent everything he saw in an encyclopedic way, that is, explaining in detail everything they saw.

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s well-known interest in sciences was noted in 1818 when she influenced her father-in-law to create the Royal Museum (the now National Museum of Brazil). Just a few months after her arrival in Brazil, was also created the first Brazilian Natural History Museum, which promoted scientists to explore Brazil. In September 1824, the British well-travelled and published writer Maria Graham arrived to Boa Vista and was given a friendly reception by Dom Pedro and Maria Leopoldina and granted full authority over the upbringing of their eldest daughter Maria da Glória, whose education at that time was widely neglected; soon Maria Leopoldina and her daughter&#x27;s governess relationship quickly grew into an affectionate friendship, moreover because both shared a common interest in the sciences. Although after only six weeks Maria Graham was dismissed from her post by Dom Pedro, to Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s dismay, both women&#x27;s common interest allowed them to stay close to each other up until Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s death: they wanted to get information that they were not privileged to because they were living in a male dominated world.

==Regent and Empress of Brazil==
===Background of the Independence===

The year 1821 was decisive in Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s life. Belonging to one of the most conservative and enduring families in Europe (the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) she came from a careful education based on the molds of the absolutist monarchies of the time. In June 1821, a frightened Maria Leopoldina wrote to her father &quot;My husband, God help us, loves the new ideas&quot;, suspicious of the new constitutional and liberal political values; she personally witnessed the events that took place in Europe years before, in which Napoleon Bonaparte systematically altered the political power of the continent, having a certain influence on his way of seeing these new political concepts. The conservative and traditional education of which the Archduchess had been disciplined also adds to this aspect.

Maria Leopoldina, previously lacking in affection and approval, quickly gives way to the adult woman who faces life without illusions. As the friction between Portugal and Brazil unfolded, she became increasingly involved in the turmoil of political events that preceded the Independence of Brazil. Her involvement with Brazilian politics would lead her to play a fundamental role in the later Independence, alongside José Bonifácio de Andrada. In this phase, she distances herself from the conservative (absolutist) ideas of the Vienna court and adopts a more liberal (constitutional) discourse in favor of the Brazilian cause.

As a result of the Liberal Revolution that took place in Portugal in 1820, on 25 April 1821 the court was forced to return to Portugal. A squadron of eleven ships took King John VI, the court, the royal house and the royal treasury back to the continent, and only Dom Pedro remained in Brazil as regent of the country, with ample powers counterbalanced by a regency council. At first, the new Regent was incapable of dominating the chaos: the situation was dominated by the Portuguese troops, in anarchic conditions. The opposition between Portuguese and Brazilians became increasingly evident. It can be clearly seen in Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s correspondence that she warmly espoused the cause of the Brazilian people and came to desire the country&#x27;s Independence.

===The conspirator of São Cristóvão===

Maria Leopoldina grew up fearing popular revolutions due to the example of her great-aunt Marie Antoinette, the last Queen of France, guillotined during the French Revolution. However, the fear of revolutions that would diminish the powers of the monarchs by popular revolt as happened in France in 1789 and recently in Portugal in 1820 was not seen in Brazil: &quot;As soon as the autonomist movement and then the independence movement won Dom Pedro and Dona Leopoldina as protagonists, the Brazilians saw them as allies for the first time, and not as tyrants who should be defeated to give up power&quot;.

Prepared to maintain fidelity to the absolutist monarchy, Maria Leopoldina did not imagine that she would be Regent in the troubled moments that preceded the break with Portugal, nor that she would defend the Independence of Brazil even before Dom Pedro, in a clear attitude contrary to the education she received. The Austrian Archduchess was always on the side of the Brazilian cause and, in several letters written to her friends in Europe, began to distinguish between Portuguese and Brazilians, making it clear what she thought about Portuguese domination over the colony. With the return of the court to Portugal and the appointment of Dom Pedro as Prince Regent of Brazil (25 April 1821), Maria Leopoldina conceived that staying in America was the solution for the defense of dynastic legitimacy against the liberal excesses that threatened the power of the Houses of Habsburg and Bragança in Brazil. Dom Pedro, by the other hand, without any political experience and overwhelmed by the current unstable situation, constantly asked his father to release him from the regency and allow him and his family to return to Portugal—in September 1821, six months after King John VI&#x27;s departure, he wrote: &quot;I beg Your Majesty most urgently to release me from this onerous task&quot;.

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s determination to stay became even more staunch thanks to the support of José Bonifácio de Andrada, and educated man from São Paulo; with his help, she decisively convinced her husband that maintaining the territorial integrity of Brazil was only possible if they both remained there. Finally, on 9 January 1822 Dom Pedro solemnly declared: &quot;Fico!&quot; (&quot;I am staying&quot;). At the age of 24, Maria Leopoldina made a political decision that sentenced her to indefinite stay in America and would deprive her for the rest of her life from living near her father, siblings and other family members. Just as her sister Marie Louise married Napoleon Bonaparte with the intention of bringing political relations between the Austrian and the French Empires closer through this wedding, for Maria Leopoldina a role was kept in history much more relevant than that of her sister.

Two days later, the decision of the Prince-Regent to remain in Brazil caused outraged among the &quot;Cortes&quot; (the elected parliamentary representatives of the Brazilian people, who wanted that the whole royal family leave the country, after which Brazil would have been divided up into separate regions): government offices and buildings were burned—a revolution broke out. Dom Pedro and Maria Leopoldina were at the theatre at that moment; while he rode out with his troops against the &quot;Cortes&quot;, Maria Leopoldina went onto the stage and announced: &quot;Remain calm, my husband has everything under control!&quot;. With this announcement (who was greeted with jubilation) she placed herself firmly on the side of the Brazilian people.

However, Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s knew that her life was in danger; she hurriedly back to Boa Vista. Seven months pregnant at that moment, she took both her children, three-year-old Maria da Glória and eleven-month-old João Carlos, into a coach and fled with them to Santa Cruz, in a perilous twelve-hour journey. The political situation soon calmed down and she was able to return with her children to Boa Vista. However, the young Prince João Carlos never recovered from the strain and died on 4 February 1822.

At the end of 1821, a letter of Maria Leopoldina addressed to her secretary Schäffer makes it clear that she was, since that time, more decided by Brazil and by the Brazilians than Dom Pedro: it was necessary to stay in Brazil and go against the demands of the Portuguese court. Her &quot;Dia do Fico&quot; was earlier than that of her husband.

In the Manifesto to the Friendly Nations, signed by Dom Pedro on 6 August 1822, the despotism of the courts of Lisbon was denounced in relation to Brazilian affairs and called upon the friendly nations of Brazil to deal directly with matters with Rio de Janeiro and no longer with the Portuguese government, explaining its cause and events from the point of view of Brazilians. In the same document, however, it is possible to observe that, even on the eve of the Proclamation of Independence, the prince regent did not wish to dissolve the ties between Portugal and Brazil, but did not promise to defend the links between the two countries. That would be an ineffective measure of neutrality, since a month later the country would become independent. As a woman was not well regarded in the political environment, Maria Leopoldina acted by means of &quot;specific advice and influencing others to her husband, [so] she was achieving her conquests&quot;. Dom Pedro, at first, avoided contact with the Brazilian idea of freedom, trying to maintain neutrality, aiming to avoid the probable punishment of losing his inheritance to the Portuguese throne if he disobeyed the courts. Maria Leopoldina realized that Portugal, dominated by the courts, was already lost and that Brazil still lay like a blank canvas, which could become a future power, much more relevant than the old metropolis: the court orders, if enforced, would eventually shatter Brazil into dozens of republics, as had happened with the Spanish colonies in South America. According to Ezekiel Ramirez, the signs of a nascent Brazilian unit as an independent nation in the southern provinces were visible, but the north supported the Lisbon Cortes and called for regional independence. If the Prince Regent had left the country at that moment, Brazil would be lost to Portugal because the courts of Lisbon repeated the same error that led the Spanish courts to lose the colonies, seeking to establish direct contacts with each province in particular.

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s attitude, defending Brazilian interests, is eloquently stamped in the letter he wrote to Dom Pedro, on the occasion of Brazil&#x27;s independence:

In Rio de Janeiro, thousands of signatures collected required the regents to remain in Brazil. &quot;José Bonifácio de Andrada&#x27;s courageous attitude toward Portuguese arrogance greatly encouraged the aspirations for unity that existed in the southern provinces, especially in São Paulo. A highly educated men led this movement.&quot; After the &quot;Dia do Fico&quot; a new ministry was organized under the leadership of José Bonifácio, &quot;a strictly monarchist&quot;, and the Prince-Regent soon won the trust of the people. On 15 February 1822 the Portuguese troops left Rio de Janeiro, and their departure represented the dissolution of the ties between Brazil and the metropolis. Dom Pedro was triumphantly received in Minas Gerais.

===Regency===
When her husband traveled to São Paulo in August 1822 to pacify politics (which culminated in the proclamation of Brazil&#x27;s Independence in September), Maria Leopoldina was appointed as his official representative, that is, as Regent in his absence. Her status was confirmed with a document of investiture dated 13 August 1822 in which Dom Pedro appointing her head of the Council of State and Acting Princess-Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, giving her complete authority to take any necessary political decisions during his absence. Great was her influence in the process of independence. The Brazilians were already aware that Portugal intended to call Dom Pedro back, relegating Brazil again to the status of a simple colony rather than a kingdom united to that of Portugal. There were fears that a civil war would separate the Province of São Paulo from the rest of Brazil.

The Princess-Regent received a new decree with demands from Lisbon arrived in Rio de Janeiro and, without time to wait for Dom Pedro&#x27;s return, Maria Leopoldina, advised by José Bonifácio de Andrada, and using her attributes as interim head of government, met in the morning of 2 September 1822 with the Council of State and signed the Decree of Independence, declaring Brazil separate from Portugal. Maria Leopoldina send Dom Pedro a letter, along with another letter from José Bonifácio, as well as comments from Portugal criticizing the actions of her husband and King John VI. In her letter to her husband, the Princess-Regent suggests her husband to proclaim the Independence of Brazil, with the warning: &quot;The fruit is ripe, pick it up, otherwise it will rot&quot; (&quot;O pomo está maduro, colha-o já, senão apodrece&quot;).

Dom Pedro declared the Independence of Brazil upon receiving the letter of his wife on 7 September 1822 at São Paulo. Maria Leopoldina had also sent papers received from Lisbon, and comments from Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada, deputy to the courts, for which the Prince-Regent learned of criticism of him in the metropolis. The position of John VI and all his ministry, dominated by the courts, was difficult.

While awaiting the return of her husband, Maria Leopoldina, the interim ruler of an already independent country, idealized the flag of Brazil, in which she mixed the green of the House of Braganza and the golden yellow of the House of Habsburg. Other authors say that Jean-Baptiste Debret, the French artist who designed what he saw in Brazil in the 1820s, was the author of the national pavilion that replaced that of the old Portuguese court, symbol of the oppression of the old regime. Debret is the design of the beautiful imperial flag, in collaboration with José Bonifácio de Andrada, in which the green rectangle of the Braganza represented the forests and the yellow rhombus, color of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, represented the gold. After that, Maria Leopoldina committed herself deeply in the recognition of the autonomy of the new country by the European courts, writing letters to the father, the Emperor of Austria, and to her father-in-law, the King of Portugal.

Maria Leopoldina became Brazil&#x27;s first Empress consort, being acclaimed as such on 1 December 1822, at the coronation ceremony and consecration of her husband as Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. Due to Brazil&#x27;s status as at the time the only monarchy in South America, Maria Leopoldina was the first Empress of the New World.

===Bahia&#x27;s participation in the independence process===

First headquarters of the government, radiating center for metropolitan policies and strategic port, Bahia only lost its privileged situation in Brazil with the discovery of gold in the Hereditary Captaincy of Espírito Santo, and the region where the deposits were discovered by &quot;Bandeirantes&quot; was dismembered from the said captaincy and transformed in the province of Minas Gerais (dismemberment that was repeated as new deposits were discovered, causing the Captaincy of Espírito Santo to narrow Minas Gerais, in an ill-fated containment barrier against gold smuggling) and the subsequent transfer of the capital to Rio de Janeiro, in 1776. Salvador did not want to welcome the passing court, as it did in 1808, but permanently. In the process of separating from Portugal, Bahia hosted antagonistic currents: the pro-independence interior and the capital loyal to the court of Lisbon. After 7 September 1822, there was an armed struggle that gave victory to the imperial troops on 2 July 1823.

Bahian women actively participated in the patriotic battle. Maria Quitéria, enlisted clandestinely as a loyal soldier to the Brazilian cause, was described by Maria Graham and decorated by the Order of the Southern Cross by Emperor Pedro I. The oral tradition of Itaparica Island also records the role of Afro-Brazilian Maria Felipa de Oliveira, who would have led more than 40 black women and defending the Island. Already Sister Joana Angélica, Abbess of the Convent of Lapa, prevented with her own life the entry of Portuguese troops in the cloister.

Women&#x27;s political awareness is also highlighted in the &quot;Carta das senhoras baianas à sua alteza real dona Leopoldina&quot;, who congratulates the Princess-Regent for her part in the patriotic resolutions on behalf of her husband and the country. In the letter of 186 Bahian ladies, delivered by hand in August 1822, was express their gratitude for Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s stay in Brazil. The Princess-Regent writes to her husband to express her views on the presence of women in politics, telling him that the attitude of those ladies &quot;proves that women are more cheerful and are more adherent to the good cause&quot;. Despite not returning to host the government, Bahia played an important role in the regional political balance in favor of the Brazilian Empire. In recognition of the support obtained in the Independence process, the Emperor and Empress visited Salvador between February and March 1826.

==Decline in health and death==
===Popular commotion===
King John VI of Portugal died on 10 March 1826; Dom Pedro in consequence inherited the Portuguese throne as King Pedro IV, while remaining Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Maria Leopoldina thus became both Empress consort of Brazil and Queen consort of Portugal. However, aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, less than two months later, on 2 May, Dom Pedro hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal in favor of their eldest daughter Maria da Glória, who became Queen Dona Maria II.

The Emperor&#x27;s scandalous relationship with Domitila de Castro Canto e Melo, Marchioness of Santos, the public recognition of their illegitimate daughter, the appointment of the mistress as lady-in-waiting to the Empress, and the trip of the imperial couple together with the Marchioness of Santos to Bahia in the beginning of 1826 were events that left Maria Leopoldina totally humiliated, shaking her morally and psychologically. The daughter that the Emperor had with his mistress in May 1824 (only three months later, the Empress also gave birth) was officially legitimized by him, named Isabel Maria de Alcântara Brasileira and granted the title of Duchess of Goiás with the style of Highness and the right to use the honorific &quot;Dona&quot;. In a letter to her sister Marie Louise, the Empress says: &quot;The seductive monster is the cause of all my misfortunes&quot;. Solitary, isolated, devoted only to giving birth to an heir to the throne (the future Emperor Dom Pedro II would be born in 1825), Maria Leopoldina became increasingly depressed. Since the beginning of November 1826, the Empress&#x27; health rapidly waned: cramps, vomiting, bleeding and delusions were frequent in her last weeks of her life, worsened by a new pregnancy.

Maria Leopoldina was loved by all the Brazilian people, and her popularity was even greater and more expressive than that of Dom Pedro. Rio de Janeiro began to monitor the severity of the Empress&#x27; disease. The ambassador of the Kingdom of Prussia, Theremim, related with respect the public demonstrations of love for the Empress to the court of Berlin:

On 7 December 1826, the &quot;Diário Fluminense&quot; reported that the people of Rio de Janeiro continued, in their anxiety, to seek at all times to know the &quot;afflictive state&quot; of the Empress:

On the afternoon of the previous day (6 December), as reported by the same newspaper (and later confirmed by Father Sampaio&#x27;s sermon) several processions accompanying &quot;the Sacred Images of the respective churches&quot; were destined for the Imperial Chapel. According to Father Sampaio:

===Cause of death===
There are disagreements about the real cause of death of the first Empress of Brazil. For some authors, Maria Leopoldina would have died as a result of puerperal sepsis, while the Emperor was in Rio Grande do Sul, where he had inspected the troops during the Cisplatine War.

The version that Maria Leopoldina died as a result of the attacks on her during a tantrum of her husband, is a widespread theory corroborated by historians such as Gabriac, Carl Seidler, John Armitage and Isabel Lustosa. The perception of real violence as the cause of death suffered a certain setback —even if a fatal assault did not necessarily reach the skeleton— with the recent exhumation of the Empress&#x27; remains where there was no bone fracture. This would have happened on 20 November 1826, when Maria Leopoldina would take over the regency so that the Emperor could travel to the South to deal with the war against Uruguay. Wanting to prove that the rumors about his extramarital relations and the bad climate between the Imperial couple were lies, Dom Pedro I decided to hold a large farewell reception where he demanded that both the Empress and his mistress the Marchioness of Santos appear together with him before the ecclesiastical and diplomatic dignitaries for the protocolary hand-kissing. With the fulfillment of this demand, Maria Leopoldina would have officially recognized her husband&#x27;s mistress, and for this she defied Dom Pedro I&#x27;s orders and refused to appear at the reception. The Emperor, known to have a volatile genius, had a bitter argument with his wife, and even tried to drag her around the palace, attacking her with words and kicks. At the end, he attended the hand-kissing ceremony accompanied only by the Marchioness of Santos and departed to the war with no resolution to the situation. There is no other witness of the aggression other than the three, and that the suspicions about the aggressions suffered were raised by the ladies and doctors who supported Maria Leopoldina afterwards. The reality of the facts was perhaps different:

The Empress, who had been in severe depression for months and in the 12th week of pregnancy, had a profoundly damaged health. Reportedly, she send a last letter to her sister Marie Louise, dictated to the Marchioness of Aguiar, in which she mentions the terrible attack she had suffered at the hands of her husband in the presence of his mistress; however, recent studies show that this last letter from Maria Leopoldina can be a fraud. The original, in French, was never found in any file, in Brazil or abroad. The copy in the Historical Archives of the Imperial Museum in Petrópolis, is written in Portuguese, with a single sentence in French saying that the transcription was made according to an original issued on 12 December 1826. This copy, used by all scholars until then, only appeared in Rio de Janeiro on 5 August 1834 (almost eight years after the Empress&#x27;s death) to be registered with the notary Joaquim José de Castro. They served as witnesses to certify the origin of the letter César Cadolino, J. M. Flach, J. Buvelot and Carlos Heindricks. Of these, evidently two, Cadolino and Flach, were greatly indebted to Maria Leopoldina and for them was nothing better than to have a &quot;confession&quot; made by the Empress herself.

===Reactions===
During Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s agony, the most diverse rumors arose: that the Empress was a prisoner at the Quinta da Boa Vista, that she was being poisoned by her doctor at the behest of the Marchioness of Santos, among others. Domitila de Castro&#x27;s popularity, which was no longer the best, worsened, with her house in São Cristóvão being stoned and her brother-in-law, a butler of the Empress, received two shots. The Marchioness&#x27; right to preside over medical appointments of the Empress, as her lady-in-waiting, was denied, and ministers and officials of the palace suggested that she should not continue to attend court.

The statement issued on 11 December to the Emperor about his wife&#x27;s death reports seizures, high fever and delusions. Enjoying a great appreciation for the population, who admired her much more than her husband, her death was mourned by much of the nation.

This version of events was propagated to Europe, and Dom Pedro I&#x27;s reputation was so tarnished that his second marriage became very difficult. It is said that the first recipient of the Imperial Order of Dom Pedro I, Emperor Francis I of Austria, would have received the condecoration as an apology from the Brazilian emperor, his son-in-law.

Luiz Roberto Fontes —coroner who accompanied the forensic analysis of the imperial family carried out between March and August 2012—, said that a serious illness caused the miscarriage and death of Maria Leopoldina, and not a fight between the Imperial couple at Quinta da Boa Vista, in Rio de Janeiro, as he mentioned to the public in a lecture at the MusIAL (Museu do Instituto Adolfo Lutz):

The first threat of miscarriage occurred on 19 November, when the Empress had a small bleed. With the worsening of the condition during the week, she also suffered from fever and severe diarrhea, which indicate a dangerous intestinal hemorrhage for a pregnant woman.

On 30 November, the delusions were added until medical records indicated the Empress miscarried a male fetus of about three-months-old of gestation on 2 December, days before her death. Even after losing the baby, Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s health did not improve and started to have more and more delusions, fever and hemorrhages, &quot;that is, she was in a clear septic picture, a picture of death&quot;, said the coroner.

===Death and preservation of memory===

Maria Leopoldina died at the São Cristóvão Palace in the Quinta da Boa Vista, located in the neighborhood of São Cristóvão, in the northern part of the city of Rio de Janeiro on 11 December 1826, five weeks before her 30th birthday. The funeral ceremony was chaired by Francisco do Monte Alverne, official preacher of the Empire of Brazil.

Her body, covered with the imperial mantle, was placed in three urns: the first made of Portuguese pine, the second made of lead (with its own Latin inscription, on which there was a skull with two crossed tibias, and on this, the imperial coat silver) and the third of cedar.
She was buried on 14 December 1826 in the church of the Ajuda Convent (currently the Cinelândia). When the convent was demolished in 1911, her remains were transferred to the Santo Antônio Convent, also in Rio de Janeiro, where a mausoleum was built for her and some members of the imperial family. In 1954, her remains were definitively transferred to a green granite sarcophagus decorated with gold, in the Imperial Crypt and Chapel, under the Ipiranga Monument, in the city of São Paulo.

==Legacy==
Although she is portrayed as a melancholic woman and humiliated by the scandals and extramarital relations of Dom Pedro I (representing her as the fragile link in the love triangle), the most recent historiography has claimed to Maria Leopoldina a less passive image in national history.

Maria Leopoldina had great prominence in Brazilian politics, either when the Portuguese court returned to Portugal, or behind the scenes of the friction between Brazil and Portugal until the moment of Independence in 1822. While Dom Pedro I still maintained the possibility of maintaining the United Kingdom with Portugal, Maria Leopoldina had already found that the most prudent path was the total emancipation of the metropolis. Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s intellectual and political education, combined with her strong sense of duty and sacrifice on behalf of the State, were fundamental to Brazil, especially after King John VI, under Portuguese pressure, was forced to return to Lisbon. Since she was an Archduchess of Austria and member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and who had been educated under an aristocratic and absolutist regime, Maria Leopoldina did not hesitate to defend ideals and more representative forms of government for Brazil, influenced by liberalism and constitutionalism.

Brazilians had great respect and admiration for Maria Leopoldina from the first moments when she set foot in Brazil. Very popular (a view even stronger among the poorest and slaves), from the moment of her death she had started to be called the &quot;Mother of Brazilians&quot;. Petitions were made for the Empress to receive the title of &quot;Guardian Angel of this nascent Empire&quot;. During the period in which she was ill in her last days of life, processions were carried out on the streets of Rio de Janeiro; churches and chapels filled with people in deep sadness. The news of her death caused a stir throughout the city. The people took to the streets in tears, and there are reports of slaves who lamented with screams: &quot;Our mother died. What will become of us? Who will take sides with blacks?&quot;. With her death, the popularity of Dom Pedro I, allied to the problems of the first reign, declined considerably. The writer and biographer of her life, Carlos H. Oberacker Júnior, says that &quot;rarely has a foreigner been so dear and recognized by a people like her&quot;.

During her life, Maria Leopoldina looked for ways to end slavery. In an attempt to change the type of labor in Brazil, the Empress encouraged European immigration to the country. Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s arrival in Brazil fostered the beginning of German immigration to the country, first coming from the Swiss, settling in Rio de Janeiro and founding the city of Nova Friburgo. Then, to populate southern Brazil, the Empress encouraged the Germans to come. The presence of Maria Leopoldina in South America attracted attention as a way to &quot;propagandize&quot; Brazil among the Germanic milieu.
The importance and relevance of the Empress on Brazilian soil is also due to the fact of the scientific mission that accompanied her on a journey from the Italian Peninsula, composed of European painters, scientists and botanists. As Maria Leopoldina was interested in botany and geology, two German scientists came with her: botanist Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius and zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix, known names in the natural sciences of the 19th century, in addition to the traveling painter Thomas Ender. The research of this mission resulted in the works &quot;Viagem pelo Brasil&quot; and &quot;Flora Brasiliensis&quot;, a compendium of approximately 20,000 pages with classification and illustration of thousands of species of native plants. Together, the scientists traveled another 10,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to the borders with Peru and Colombia.

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s stance in refusing to return to Portugal still divides opinions, because while for a group of writers that was a revolutionary attitude, for others the Archduchess was just a strategist. For Maria Celi Chaves Vasconcelos, a professor at UERJ and a specialist in the education of noble women, there is not the slightest trace of rebellion in any writing by or about Maria Leopoldina: &quot;Would it be revolutionary because it influenced Dom Pedro in the Proclamation of Independence? I don&#x27;t think there is any revolutionary trait there; I think she was, perhaps, knowledgeable enough about political history to make the correct judgment about the moment lived and how much he was conducive to Independence&quot;, defends the researcher. &quot;Regardless of the reasons that made Maria Leopoldina stay in Brazil, the Empress must be interpreted as a revolutionary woman because she was the first to make politics in the high sphere of Brazilian decisions&quot;, defends historian Paulo Rezzutti.

==Depictions in culture==
Empress Maria Leopoldina has already been portrayed as a character in cinema and television, being played by Kate Hansen in the film &quot;Independência ou Morte&quot; (1972), by Maria Padilha in the miniseries &quot;Marquesa de Santos&quot; (1984) and by Érika Evantini in the miniseries &quot;O Quinto dos Infernos&quot; (2002).

Maria Leopoldina&#x27;s life was also the subject of the 1996 plot of the samba school &quot;Imperatriz Leopoldinense&quot;, whose name already derives indirectly from her (because the school is based in the area of the Estrada de Ferro Leopoldina, named in honor of the Empress). On the occasion, the carnival designer and professor Rosa Magalhães received support from the Austrian government for the parade.

In 2007, the actress Ester Elias gave life to Maria Leopoldina in the musical &quot;Império&quot;, by Miguel Falabella, which tells part of the history of the Empire of Brazil.

In 2017, actress Letícia Colin played the Empress Maria Leopoldina in the telenovela Novo Mundo.

In 2018, Maria Leopoldina and &quot;Imperatriz Leopoldinense&quot; were honored by the &quot;Tom Maior&quot; samba school, at the São Paulo carnival.

== Children ==

By June 1818 Maria Leopoldina became pregnant, and her first child, Maria da Glória, was born after a difficult delivery on 4 April 1819. Her next pregnancy ended in a miscarriage in November 1819, and on 26 April 1820 she suffered her second miscarriage; the child, a son, was named Miguel in honor of his paternal uncle and died almost immediately. These failed pregnancies had a profound effect on Maria Leopoldina, who, conscious of her primary duty to produce an heir to the House of Bragança, became depressed and withdrew from society for a time. Her first living son, João Carlos, Prince of Beira, was born on 6 March 1821, to the joy of the court and the people, but died on 4 February 1822 aged 11 months. Her next three pregnancies resulted in three daughters, Januária (born 11 March 1822), Paula (born 17 February 1823) and Francisca (born 2 August 1824) until the birth of the long-hoped for son and heir, the future Emperor Dom Pedro II, on 2 December 1825. Her ninth and last pregnancy was fatal to her: she died from complications following a miscarriage.

<text>U.S. Route 240 is a defunct designation for a short, but once very important, segment of highway between Frederick, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. It is now commonly known as Wisconsin Avenue, Maryland Route 355 (MD 355), and Interstate 270 (I-270).

==Route description==
This route description features US 240 as it existed in 1945, with references to today&#x27;s highways to provide context.
===Washington, D.C.===
US 240 began at the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and 14th Street, NW, near the White House in Washington, D.C. US 240 headed west on Pennsylvania Avenue to 15th Street, then headed west from that intersection on Treasury Place for one block (entering an area now closed to the public and known as President&#x27;s Park). The U.S. Highway curved around the south side of the South Lawn on South Executive Avenue past the Zero Milestone Marker to continue onto E Street west one block to 17th Street. US 240 followed 17th Street north to Farragut Square, where the highway intersected K Street, which carried US 50.

US 240 continued north along Connecticut Avenue to Dupont Circle, which did not have an underpass for Connecticut Avenue when US 240 was designated. At the circle, the U.S. Highway met US 29, which used New Hampshire Avenue on both sides of the circle, and US 240 Alternate, which headed north on Connecticut Avenue. US 240 continued northwest on Massachusetts Avenue. The highway passed through Sheridan Circle, crossed Rock Creek on what is now named the Charles C. Glover Memorial Bridge, and passed along part of Observatory Circle on the edge of the circular U.S. Naval Observatory grounds. US 240 followed Massachusetts Avenue to its intersection with Wisconsin Avenue next to Washington National Cathedral. There, the U.S. Highway turned north and followed Wisconsin Avenue through Tenleytown to the District of Columbia boundary at Western Avenue in Friendship Heights.

By 1959, the starting point and routing of US 240 south of Massachusetts Avenue and 22nd Street (one block east of Sheridan Circle) had changed. The southern terminus was at the traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial (which carried US 50) heading north on 23rd Street, NW, passing through Washington Circle where it intersected with US 29 which headed west on K St. and northeast on New Hampshire Avenue. Due to one-way roads the north and southbound lanes of US 240 ran on different streets for the next six blocks. Northbound US 240 followed New Hampshire Avenue (and US 29) northeast for one block and then turning directly north on 22nd Street (one way northbound) to Massachusetts Avenue, where it turned northwest. Southbound from Massachusetts Avenue on 22nd it forked onto 23rd Street (one way southbound) to Washington Circle. The southern terminus of US 240 Alternate was rerouted down Florida Avenue from Connecticut Avenue to connect with US 240 at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue, 22nd Street, and Florida Avenue.

===Maryland===

US 240 followed a divided highway north to its intersection with MD 191, which as today headed west as Bradley Boulevard, a divided highway, and east as Bradley Lane. The U.S. highway became undivided and intersected MD 82 (Leland Street) and crossed over the Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad before meeting the southern and western ends of MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road) and MD 410 (East–West Highway), respectively, in the center of Bethesda. This intersection also served as the northern end of US 240 Alternate, which headed east along MD 410 to Connecticut Avenue, which was then MD 193 and is now MD 185. North of Bethesda, US 240 met the western end of MD 702 (Jones Bridge Road) just south of the National Naval Medical Center. The highway descended into the valley of Rock Creek then left the valley and met the western end of MD 547 (Strathmore Avenue).

US 240 intersected Montrose Road and then the northern end of MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road) at the village of Montrose. The highway began to parallel the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision) as it approached the town of Rockville. US 240 entered the county seat at Dodge Street and had an acute intersection with MD 28 (Viers Mill Road). The two highways ran concurrently northwest along a street that no longer exists to Montgomery Avenue, then west on Montgomery Avenue to Washington Street. There, MD 28 continued west on Montgomery Avenue and US 240 continued out of town on Washington Street. The U.S. Highway paralleled the railroad to Derwood, where the highway intersected MD 688 (Redland Road) just north of Indianola Drive. US 240 intersected Shady Grove Road and entered the town of Gaithersburg at Summit Avenue. The highway crossed over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad between a pair of oblique intersections with MD 124 (West and East Diamond Avenue), which ran concurrently with US 240 across the railroad.

US 240 continued north from Gaithersburg across Great Seneca Creek to the hamlets of Middlebrook and Neelsville. In the latter location, the highway met the northern end of MD 118 (Germantown Road) at what is now Boland Farm Road and the southern end of MD 27 (Ridge Road) at what is presently Henderson Corner Road. US 240 crossed Little Seneca Creek and had a pair of staggered intersections with MD 121 (Clarksburg Road); the latter highway followed what are now Spire Street and Redgrave Place north and south, respectively. The U.S. Highway crossed Little Bennett Creek just south of the village of Hyattstown, where the highway intersected Old Hundred Road; MD 109 did not yet extend to Hyattstown. Just north of Hyattstown, US 240 crossed the Montgomery–Frederick county line and met the southern end of MD 75 (Green Valley Road).

US 240 crossed Bennett Creek as it approached Urbana, through which the highway ran concurrently with MD 80 (Fingerboard Road). The U.S. Highway descended into the valley of the Monocacy River, which the highway crossed just south of its bridge across the Old Main Line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Frederick Junction. South of the city limits of Frederick, US 240 had an oblique intersection with US 15 (Buckeystown Pike) just south of the modern intersection of MD 355 and MD 85. US 15 and US 240 entered Frederick together along Market Street. The U.S. Highways crossed Carroll Creek before US 240 ended at US 40 (Patrick Street) in the center of downtown Frederick. US 15 continued north along Market Street toward Gettysburg.

==History==

U.S. 240&#x27;s original route between Maryland Route 109 and Maryland Route 85 (then part of U.S. 15) was supplanted by a new freeway alignment in 1953; U.S. 240 was diverted away from its original route onto the new freeway as it was completed south to the future alignment of the Capital Beltway. In 1956, with the arrival of the Interstate Highway System, the route gained the designation Interstate 70S (now Interstate 270).

In Maryland, the whole of U.S. 240 was redesignated as Maryland Route 355 around 1970. U.S. 240 crossed into Washington, D.C., on Wisconsin Avenue, it turns southwest onto Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.) and then south-southwest onto Connecticut Avenue at Dupont Circle. It reached U.S. Route 50 at K Street and by 1968 extended to the area around the Lincoln Memorial . Signs for U.S. 240 within Washington existed at least into the early 1970s, when the route was deleted in its entirety, leaving I-70S (now I-270) as the sole route following the original freeway.

In addition, Alternate U.S. 240 ran along Connecticut Avenue through Washington, D.C., and Maryland inside the Washington Beltway with its southern end at the intersection with U.S. 240 at Dupont Circle.

<text>Koinonia Farm is a Christian farming intentional community in Sumter County, Georgia.

==History==
The farm was founded in 1942 by two couples, Clarence and Florence Jordan and Martin and Mabel England, as a &quot;demonstration plot for the Kingdom of God.&quot; For them, this meant following the example of the first Christian communities as described in the Acts of the Apostles, amid the poverty and racism of the rural South. The name Koinonia is an ancient Greek word, used often in the New Testament, meaning deep fellowship. Koinonia members divested themselves of personal wealth and joined a &quot;common purse&quot; economic system. They envisioned an interracial community where blacks and whites could live and work together in a spirit of partnership.

Based on their interpretation of the New Testament, Koinonia members committed to the following precepts:

# Treat all human beings with dignity and justice
# Choose love over violence
# Share all possessions and live simply
# Be stewards of the land and its natural resources

Other families joined, and visitors came to &quot;serve a period of apprenticeship in developing community life on the teachings and principles of Jesus.&quot; Koinonians, visitors, and neighbors farmed, worshipped and ate together, attended Bible studies and held summer youth camps. When resources allowed the hiring of seasonal help, black and white workers were paid equally. Additional spiritual stewards of the community in the earlier years included Conrad (Con) Browne and Will Wittkamper.

=== During the Civil Rights Movement ===
These practices were a break with the prevailing culture of Jim Crow-era Georgia, and were challenged by many citizens of Sumter County, most intensely during the 1950s, and with diminishing intensity for years thereafter. A boycott of the farm occurred during the mid-1950s. The local Chamber of Commerce met with the Full Members of The Farm to request that Koinonia sell its property and disband. The 1950s also saw acts of terrorism such as dynamiting Koinonia&#x27;s roadside produce stand, firing shots into the compound, and threatening phone calls and letters. The local Ku Klux Klan drove a 70+ car motorcade to the farm as an act of intimidation. Koinonia members discerned that their religious views called them to bear these acts nonviolently; members responded by writing editorials to the local newspaper clarifying the farm&#x27;s position, maintaining an unarmed watch at the entrance to the community during the nights, and other acts of nonviolent witness.

As a way to survive in hostile surroundings, Koinonia members created a small mail-order catalog to sell their farm&#x27;s pecans and peanuts around the world. The business&#x27;s first slogan was &quot;Help us ship the nuts out of Georgia!&quot; The business evolved to include treats made in the farm&#x27;s bakery. The Koinonia Catalog business continued after the boycott concluded, and still constitutes the largest source of earned income for Koinonia.

=== Habitat for Humanity International ===

Threats of physical violence dwindled in the late 1960s, but the population of Koinonia Farm was greatly diminished due to the stress of previous years. Koinonia members searched for a new focus, and considered closing the farm experiment if none were found.

Millard and Linda Fuller had spent a month at Koinonia several years earlier. Millard had been an extremely successful businessman before he and his wife Linda rededicated their lives to Christianity, divested of their wealth, and sought ways to live out their faith. Clarence Jordan, Millard Fuller, and other allies of Koinonia engaged in a series of meetings, out of which emerged a new direction for Koinonia.

Changing its name from Koinonia Farm to Koinonia Partners, the community refocused itself as a social service organization. The organization initiated several programs in partnership with its neighbors, chief among them Koinonia Partnership Housing, which organized the construction of affordable houses for low-income neighboring families previously living in shacks and dilapidated residences. Using volunteer labor and monetary donations, Koinonia built 194 homes from 1969 to 1992, which families bought with 20-year, no-interest mortgages. Mortgage payments were placed in a revolving Fund for Humanity. Payments into this fund were used to finance the construction of more houses. Of the houses built, 62 houses sit on Koinonia&#x27;s property, forming two neighborhoods that surround the central community area; the remaining houses are located in the towns of Americus and Plains, all within Sumter County.

The Fullers guided the first four years of Koinonia Partnership Housing, and then moved to Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) for three years to establish a similar program there. In 1976, they returned to Americus and founded the non-profit organization Habitat for Humanity International. Modeled after the Koinonia Partnership Housing program, this organization builds houses with families in need, then sells the houses to the families at no profit and no interest. Habitat for Humanity volunteers and homeowners have built more than 500,000 houses in more than 100 countries.

=== Clarence Jordan&#x27;s works while at Koinonia ===

Founding member Clarence Jordan held an undergraduate degree in agriculture from the University of Georgia and wanted to use his knowledge of scientific farming &quot;to seek to conserve the soil, God&#x27;s holy earth&quot; and to assist Koinonia&#x27;s neighbors, most of whom were African-American sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Jordan and fellow founding member Martin England were ordained ministers and professors. Jordan held a doctorate in New Testament Greek. Part of their vision for Koinonia was to offer training to African-American ministers living in the area. For the first few years of the Koinonia experiment, Jordan in particular was welcomed to preach and teach in local churches. Though the demands of farming in those early years did not allow time for formal training of others, Jordan used these visits to both black and white churches to offer guidance.

In addition to his work on the farm, Jordan penned many works of theology in his writing shack, a small one-room structure set near the &quot;Bottom Garden&quot;, now in one of the farm&#x27;s pecan orchards. Among the works penned there were four volumes collectively known as the &quot;Cotton Patch Version&quot;. These four volumes were a collective work blending Clarence&#x27;s translations of the New Testament Gospels from the original Greek into the Georgia vernacular and discussions of the full membership of Koinonia on the translations and meanings. He also prepared for his nationwide speaking engagements there. Jordan&#x27;s writing and speaking engagements brought the existence of Koinonia Farm (and later Koinonia Partners) to the awareness of many Christians, theologians, students, and others. Jordan&#x27;s Cotton Patch Version of Matthew and John was the inspiration for a musical theater work by Harry Chapin, &quot;The Cotton Patch Gospel&quot;.

=== Ministries and structure since 1969 ===

On October 29, 1969, Clarence Jordan died of a heart attack at age 57, while working on a sermon in his writing shack. After Jordan&#x27;s death, other community members carried on the work of Koinonia. This work included the founding of other organizations such as Jubilee Partners in Comer, Georgia (a community that welcomes refugees from war-torn countries), New Hope House in Griffin, Georgia (assisting families with loved ones on death row, as well as advocating the abolition of the death penalty), The Prison &amp; Jail Project in Americus, Georgia (an anti-racist, grassroots organization which monitors courtrooms, prisons and jails in southwest Georgia), and The Fuller Center for Housing (the second organization founded by Millard and Linda Fuller, also pursuing affordable housing solutions for impoverished families worldwide).

Koinonia members and ministries since 1969 include civil rights work, prison ministry, racial reconciliation, peace activism, early childhood education, youth and teen outreach, affordable housing, language training, sustainable agriculture, economic development, home repair, elder programs, and more. Current ministries include affordable home repair for neighbors, an elder program, a summer youth camp, welcoming visitors and guests in hospitality, and educating the public about Koinonia history and legacy.

In 1993, Koinonia abandoned its &quot;common purse&quot; and experimented with a corporate non-profit structure. During this period the organization was known as Koinonia Partners, Inc. A board of directors and staff and volunteer positions were established to govern and operate the community, in place of the former community-based structure. This corporate structure was not suitable financially for the community. In 2005, Koinonia again reorganized, ending the distinction between staff and volunteers and committing once more to the intentional Christian community model. The common purse has not been readopted; rather, each member receives an allowance based upon his or her needs, family and responsibilities.

The community, again known by its original name, Koinonia Farm, was designated a Georgia Historic Site in 2005. In 2008, the Koinonia community received the Community of Christ International Peace Award.

<doc id="780996" wikidata="Q288773" url="?curid=780996" title="Renilla reniformis">
<text>Renilla reniformis, the sea pansy, is a species of soft coral in the family Renillidae. It is native to warm continental shelf waters of the Western Hemisphere. It is frequently found washed ashore on North East Florida beaches following northeasterly winds or rough surf conditions. It also can often be found living intertidally completely buried in the sand. Its predator is the striped sea slug, &quot;Armina tigrina&quot;.

==Description==
The sea pansy is a collection of polyps with different forms and functions. A single, giant polyp up to two inches in diameter forms the anchoring stem (peduncle). This peduncle can be distended to better anchor the colony in the substrate. The pansy-like body bears many small, anemone-like feeding polyps. A cluster of tentacleless polyps form an outlet valve that releases water to deflate the colony. If the colony is on a sand bar at low tide, it usually deflates and becomes covered with a thin film of silty sand. Small white dots between the feeding polyps are polyps that act as pumps to expand the deflated colony. The feeding polyps secrete a sticky mucus to trap tiny organisms suspended in the water. The colony’s rigidity and purple color come from calcium carbonate throughout the polyp’s tissues.

The sea pansy is strikingly bioluminescent when disturbed because of the interplay between a luciferase (Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Both molecules have recently become extremely important in biology. It also produces secondary metabolites for chemical defence that may make it an interesting source of marine natural products.

==Genome==
A draft genome of &quot;R. reniformis&quot; was sequenced in 2018, producing a haploid genome size of 172 megabases (Mb). This makes it one of the smallest and most compact coral genomes discovered to date

<doc id="780997" wikidata="Q5097310" url="?curid=780997" title="2004 Chihuahua state election">
<text>The Mexican state of Chihuahua held an election on Sunday, 4 July 2004.
At stake was the office of the Chihuahua State Governor, all 33 members of the unicameral Chihuahua State Congress, and 67 mayors and municipal councils.

Turnout was around 46% of the 2,254,234 &quot;chihuahuenses&quot; eligible to vote.

==Governor==
At the time of the election, the sitting governor was Patricio Martínez García of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

At the close of voting, exit polls were indicating a victory for José Reyes Baeza of a PRI-led alliance with a lead of ten percentage points. As the count progressed, Javier Corral Jurado of the PAN – representing an unusual alliance of his party and the left-leaning PRD – conceded the election at around 23h00 local time.

==State congress==
*22 First-past-the-post deputies:
**17 for &quot;Alianza con la Gente&quot; (PRI, PVEM, PT)
**5 for &quot;Todos Somos Chihuahua&quot; (PAN, PRD, CD)
*11 Proportional representation deputies:
**3 for &quot;Alianza con la Gente&quot; (PRI, PVEM, PT)
**8 for &quot;Todos Somos Chihuahua&quot; (PAN, PRD, CD)

==Municipalities==
Preliminary results indicated the state&#x27;s 67 municipalities would be divided as follows:
*44: PRI (in alliance with PVEM and PT)
*21: PAN (in alliance with PRD and CD)
*1: PRD
*1: PVEM (Manuel Benavides municipality)

The PAN/PRD alliance won a closely fought mayoral race in state capital Chihuahua, previously governed by the PRI. In a give-and-take action between the state&#x27;s two largest cities, borderland industrial and commercial powerhouse Ciudad Juárez fell to the PRI after 12 years of PAN rule.

<text>Zydrunas Ilgauskas (; ; born June 5, 1975) is a Lithuanian-born American former professional basketball player who played the center position. The 7&#x27;3&quot; Ilgauskas played for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association from 1997 to 2010 and played for the Miami Heat during the 2010–11 season. He was named to the 1997–98 All-Rookie First Team and is a two-time NBA All-Star. 

Ilgauskas played in the 2007 NBA Finals as a member of the Cavaliers. He is known for his accurate jump shot, for his rebounding, and for overcoming difficult injury challenges during his career. Nicknamed Big Z, Ilgauskas is the Cavaliers&#x27; career leader in blocked shots; his jersey no. 11 has been retired by the team. In 2012, Ilgauskas joined the Cavaliers&#x27; front office, becoming a special advisor to the organization.

==Professional career==

===Atletas (1993–1996)===
Ilgauskas made his professional debut in his birthplace of Kaunas, with local club Atletas in 1993. He averaged 20.3 points, 12.8 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game in the 1994–95 season.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1996–2010)===

Ilgauskas was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 20th overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. On August 1, 1996, he signed a multi-year deal with the Cavaliers. In the earliest parts of his career he suffered through a myriad of foot and ankle injuries. He spent the entire 1996–97 season on the injured list due to a broken bone in his right foot.

He was named the most valuable player of the Rookie Challenge during All-Star Weekend and selected to the All-Rookie First Team in 1997–98. He signed a contract extension in 1998 that was worth $70.9 million over six years. However, Ilgauskas played in only five games over the next two seasons. On January 26, 2000, he had a surgery on a fractured navicular bone in his left foot.

He regained the starting center spot for the Cavaliers in 2000–01. He was injured again in December 2000 and was out for the season. The injury dealt a blow to the Cavaliers. After winning 15 out of 23 games with Ilgauskas, they finished with a 30–52 record.

He returned in December 2001 and was mostly used as a backup to Chris Mihm for the rest of the season.

Ilgauskas averaged 17.2 points and 7.5 rebounds in 2002–03. He was selected as an All-Star, but the Cavaliers finished with the third-worst record in team history (17–65) and landed the number one draft pick.

The Cavaliers drafted high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP LeBron James in 2003. James teamed up with Ilgauskas and Drew Gooden to form the core of the team. Ilgauskas only missed nine games over the next three seasons and was selected as an All-Star again in 2005.
On July 12, 2005, Ilgauskas signed a contract extension with the Cavaliers. The deal was reportedly worth over $55 million over five years.

For the next four seasons, Ilgauskas was the starting center for the team, which had turned into a contender. They reached the NBA Finals in 2007 and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2009. In summer 2009, the Cavaliers acquired Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. When asked about the trade, Ilgauskas responded: &quot;I was just reading the news. That means I&#x27;ll probably be coming off the bench.&quot; On December 2, 2009, Ilgauskas came off the bench in a game against Phoenix Suns to break the team record for career games played, overtaking then-general manager Danny Ferry.

On February 17, 2010, Ilgauskas, along with a 2010 first round pick and the rights to Emir Preldžič, was traded from the Cavaliers to the Washington Wizards as part of a three-team, six-player trade that sent Antawn Jamison from Washington to Cleveland, Al Thornton from the Los Angeles Clippers to Washington, Drew Gooden from Washington to Los Angeles, and Sebastian Telfair from Los Angeles to Cleveland. On February 25, 2010, the Wizards bought out his contract, making him a free agent. Ilgauskas did not play in any games for the Wizards. It was possible for Ilgauskas to return to the Cavaliers, but only after a 30-day waiting period policy required for players traded from their former teams after being bought out of their contract by their new team. He was still free to sign with any other team.

On March 23, 2010, Ilgauskas signed a one-year deal for the remainder of the 2009–10 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He made his return a day later in a win over the New Orleans Hornets. In his first home game back with the team, against the Sacramento Kings, Ilgauskas received huge ovations and support from the crowd. Quicken Loans Arena was affectionately renamed &quot;The Z&quot; for the day, in honor of the Lithuanian.

The 2010 NBA playoffs marked the first time in Ilgauskas&#x27; career in which he was not a significant part of the Cavaliers&#x27; rotation. Ilgauskas saw only 69 minutes of floor time in the entire postseason, resulting in averages of 1.7 PPG and 1.6 RPG, far below his career playoff production. The Cavaliers were eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.

On March 8, 2014, Ilgauskas&#x27; number 11 was retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers. At the time, he was only the third European to be honored in this way by an NBA team, after Dražen Petrović and Vlade Divac.

===Miami Heat (2010–2011)===

On July 17, 2010, Ilgauskas signed with the Miami Heat. The Heat&#x27;s signings of Chris Bosh and long-time teammate LeBron James influenced Ilgauskas&#x27; decision to join the Heat. On December 2, during the Heat&#x27;s first game in Cleveland, the fans cheered Ilgauskas in pre-game introductions, while booing the rest of the starters, including James. The Heat made it to the 2011 NBA Finals, but fell short to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.

In September 2011, Ilgauskas announced that he was retiring from basketball, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family as well as citing long-term personal physical fatigue and basic bodily wear-and-tear.

==National team career==
Ilgauskas made his debut with the Lithuania national team in 1994, when the team was qualifying for a spot in the EuroBasket 1995. He averaged 7.7 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. He later wanted to play for the Lithuania national team in the 2008 Summer Olympics, but the Cavaliers did not permit him to play due to his injury history.

==Front office work==
On January 11, 2012, Ilgauskas made a return to Cleveland when he was hired by then Cleveland Cavaliers GM Chris Grant to serve as his assistant. His duties included evaluating amateur and pro talent prospects.

==Coaching career==
On September 18, 2015, Ilgauskas joined Saint Ignatius High School as the assistant coach for the boys&#x27; team.

==Personal life==
Ilgauskas and his wife were married during the summer of 2004. In 2007, the couple lost a set of twins due to pregnancy complications that caused the infants to be born four months premature. In the summer of 2009, Ilgauskas adopted two Lithuanian brothers (aged five and four at the time) from his hometown of Kaunas. On September 13, 2022, it was announced that Ilgauskas&#x27; wife died at the age of 50 on September 11.

Ilgauskas is an avid reader. He particularly enjoys military history. During his playing career, he often read in the locker room before games.

Ilgauskas became a United States citizen in 2013. In doing so, he lost his Lithuanian citizenship, as Lithuania limits the possibility of dual citizenship.

<doc id="781001" wikidata="Q3187072" url="?curid=781001" title="National Patriots' Day">
<text>National Patriots&#x27; Day () is a statutory holiday observed annually in the Canadian province of Quebec, on the Monday preceding 25 May. The holiday was established by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec-in-Council in 2003, according to the Parti Quebecois premier Bernard Landry: &quot;to underline the importance of the struggle of the patriots of 1837–1838 for the national recognition of our people, for its political liberty and to obtain a democratic system of government.&quot; Before 2003, the Monday preceding 25 May of each year was unofficially the &quot;Fête de Dollard&quot;, a commemoration initiated in the 1920s to coincide with Victoria Day, a federal holiday occurring annually on the same date.

The citizens of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu organized, in 1937, the &quot;Fêtes du centenaire de 1837&quot;, in order to commemorate the &quot;struggles of the Patriotes of 1837–1838 for liberty, the national recognition of our people and for democracy.&quot; The festivities took place at various sites across the municipality, and some residents produced souvenirs of the event.

Beginning in 1962, on the 125th anniversary of the 1837 Rebellions, a public gathering in Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu to mark the rebellion became an annual event. On 6 October 1982, the so-called &quot;Patriots&#x27; Day&quot; was declared by the Quebec Governor-in-Council as occurring each year on the Sunday closest to 23 November. The desire to see the &quot;Journée des patriotes&quot; gained a more official character and incited some citizens to campaign for the celebration to be declared a statutory holiday, either as a new holiday or in replacement of an existing one. In 1987, the &quot;Club Souverain de l&#x27;Estrie&quot; started the movement &quot;For a paid holiday in memory of the Patriots,&quot; while other organizations, such as the &quot;Saint-Jean-Baptiste&quot; Society of Montreal and the &quot;Comité du 15 février 1839&quot; (founded by Pierre Falardeau in 1997 to help finance the movie &quot;February 15, 1839 (15 février 1839)&quot;), later joined in the campaign.

During the provincial congress of the nationalist Parti Québécois (May 5–7, 2000), party members adopted a resolution inviting the government to replace the traditional holiday with a nationalist one.

On 21 November 2001, provincial premier Bernard Landry proposed a motion in the National Assembly of Quebec inviting that body to &quot;underline the importance of the struggle of the Patriots of 1837–1838.&quot; An Order in Council was then issued on 20 November the following year, establishing the &quot;Journée des patriotes&quot;—thenceforth known as &quot;National Patriots&#x27; Day&quot;—as the Monday preceding 25 May, thereby replacing the &quot;Fête de Dollard&quot;. The moving from November to May was motivated by the will to highlight the starting point of the numerous public meetings organized by citizens throughout Lower Canada from May to November 1837 in reaction to the passing of British Home Secretary Lord John Russell&#x27;s by the House of Commons.

The first official replacement holiday took place on 19 May 2003.

<doc id="781005" wikidata="Q232376" url="?curid=781005" title="Anna May Wong">
<text>Wong Liu Tsong (January 3, 1905 - February 3, 1961), known professionally as Anna May Wong, was an American actress, considered the first Chinese American film star in Hollywood, as well as the first Chinese American actress to gain international recognition. Her varied career spanned silent film, sound film, television, stage, and radio.

Born in Los Angeles to second-generation Taishanese Chinese American parents, Wong became engrossed in films and decided at the age of 11 that she would become an actress. Her first role was as an extra in the movie &quot;The Red Lantern&quot; (1919). During the silent film era, she acted in &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot; (1922), one of the first films made in color, and in Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Wong had been one of the first to embrace the flapper look. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her the &quot;world&#x27;s best dressed woman.&quot; In the 1920s and 1930s, Wong was acclaimed as one of the top fashion icons.

Frustrated by the stereotypical supporting roles she reluctantly played in Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in March 1928, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them &quot;Piccadilly&quot; (1929). She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the United States and Europe for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, and went on to appear in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931), with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932), &quot;Java Head&quot; (1934), and &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; (1937).

In 1935, Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in the film version of Pearl S. Buck&#x27;s &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. MGM instead cast Luise Rainer to play the leading role in yellowface. One biographer believes that the choice was due to the Hays Code anti-miscegenation rules requiring the wife of a white actor, Paul Muni (ironically playing a Chinese character in yellowface) to be played by a white actress. But the 1930–1934 Hays Code of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America insisted only that &quot;miscegenation (sex relationship between the white and black races) was forbidden&quot; and said nothing about other interracial marriages. Other biographers have not corroborated this theory, including historian Shirley Jennifer Lim&#x27;s &quot;Anna May Wong: Performing the Modern&quot;. MGM screen-tested Wong for the supporting role of Lotus, the seductress, but it is ambiguous whether she refused the role on principle or was rejected.

Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family&#x27;s ancestral village, studying Chinese culture, and documenting the experience on film at a time when prominent female directors in Hollywood were few.

In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese and Chinese Americans in a positive light.

She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to help the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.

In 1951, Wong made history with her television show &quot;The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong&quot;, the first-ever U.S. television show starring an Asian-American series lead. She had been planning to return to film in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; when she died in 1961, at the age of 56, from a heart attack. For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; and demure &quot;Butterfly&quot; roles that she was often given. Her life and career were re-evaluated in the years around the centennial of her birth, in three major literary works and film retrospectives.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Anna May Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong (, &quot;Liu Tsong&quot; literally meaning &quot;willow frost&quot;) on January 3, 1905, on Flower Street in Los Angeles, one block north of Chinatown, in an integrated community of Chinese, Irish, German and Japanese residents. She was the second of seven children born to Wong Sam-sing, owner of the Sam Kee Laundry, and his second wife, Lee Gon-toy.

Wong&#x27;s parents were second-generation Chinese Americans; her maternal and paternal grandparents had arrived in the U.S. no later than 1855. Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in Michigan Bluffs, a gold-mining area in Placer County. He had come from Chang On, a village near Taishan, Guangdong Province, China, in 1853. Anna May&#x27;s father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May&#x27;s mother. Anna May&#x27;s older sister Lew-ying (Lulu) was born in 1902, and Anna May in 1905, followed by six more children: James (1907–1971), Mary (1910–1940), Frank (1912–1989), Roger (1915–1983), Marietta (1919–1920), and Richard Wong (1922–2007).

In 1910, the family moved to a neighborhood on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese people on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students, they moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese-language school afternoons and on Saturdays.

About that same time, U.S. motion picture production began to relocate from the East Coast to the Los Angeles area. Movies were shot constantly in and around Wong&#x27;s neighborhood. She began going to Nickelodeon movie theaters and quickly became obsessed with the &quot;flickers&quot;, missing school and using lunch money to attend the cinema. Her father was not happy with her interest in films, feeling that it interfered with her studies, but Wong decided to pursue a film career regardless. At the age of nine, she constantly begged filmmakers to give her roles, earning herself the nickname &quot;C.C.C.&quot; or &quot;Curious Chinese Child&quot;. By the age of 11, Wong had come up with her stage name of Anna May Wong, formed by joining both her English and family names.

===Early career===
Wong was working at Hollywood&#x27;s Ville de Paris department store when Metro Pictures needed 300 female extras to appear in Alla Nazimova&#x27;s film &quot;The Red Lantern&quot; (1919). Without her father&#x27;s knowledge, a friend of his with movie connections helped her land an uncredited role as an extra carrying a lantern.

Wong worked steadily for the next two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus&#x27;s Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong&#x27;s personal philosophy throughout her life. The family&#x27;s religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism, and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time. However, she never officially joined the church, and her interest in it waned as she became involved with the New Thought Unity Church.

Finding it difficult to keep up with both her schoolwork and her passion, Wong dropped out of Los Angeles High School in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career. Reflecting on her decision, Wong told &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot; in 1931: &quot;I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10 years to succeed as an actress.&quot;

In 1921, Wong received her first screen credit for &quot;Bits of Life&quot;, the first anthology film, in which she played the wife of Lon Chaney&#x27;s character, Toy Ling, in a segment entitled &quot;Hop&quot;. She later recalled it fondly as the only time she played the role of a mother; her appearance earned her a cover photo on the British magazine &quot;Picture Show&quot;.


At the age of 17, Wong played her first leading role, in the early Metro two-color Technicolor movie &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot;. Written by Frances Marion, the story was based loosely on &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine singled Wong out for praise, noting her &quot;extraordinarily fine&quot; acting. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical &#x27;feeling&#x27;. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched nine times out of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy ... She should be seen again and often on the screen.&quot;

Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved reluctant to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing her as a leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, &quot;She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn&#x27;t know what to do with her.&quot; She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing &quot;exotic atmosphere&quot;, for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;Drifting&quot; (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong&#x27;s growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: &quot;Pictures are fine and I&#x27;m getting along all right, but it&#x27;s not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you&#x27;re climbing.&quot;

===Stardom===
At the age of 19, Wong was cast in a supporting role as a scheming Mongol slave in the 1924 Douglas Fairbanks picture &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;. Playing a stereotypical &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; role, her brief appearances on-screen caught the attention of audiences and critics alike. The film grossed more than $2 million and helped introduce Wong to the public. Around this time, Wong had a relationship with Tod Browning, who had directed her in &quot;Drifting&quot; a year earlier.

After this second prominent role, Wong moved out of the family home into her own apartment. Conscious that Americans viewed her as &quot;foreign-born&quot; even though she was born and raised in California, Wong began cultivating a flapper image. In March 1924, planning to make films about Chinese myths, she signed a deal creating Anna May Wong Productions; when her business partner was found to be engaging in dishonest practices, Wong brought a lawsuit against him and the company was dissolved.

It soon became evident that Wong&#x27;s career would continue to be limited by American anti-miscegenation laws, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian but being portrayed by a white actor. The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was Sessue Hayakawa. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a leading lady.

Wong continued to be offered exotic supporting roles that followed the rising &quot;vamp&quot; stereotype in cinema. She played indigenous native girls in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the Territory of Alaska, she portrayed an Eskimo in &quot;The Alaskan&quot;. She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess Tiger Lily in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Both films were shot by cinematographer James Wong Howe. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was more successful, and it was the hit of the Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film &quot;Forty Winks&quot;. Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her casting and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group of serial stars on a tour of the vaudeville circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.

In 1926, Wong put the first rivet into the structure of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre when she joined Norma Talmadge for its groundbreaking ceremony, although she was not invited to leave her hand- and foot-prints in cement. Wong and Talmadge also turned the first spadeful of earth using a gold-plated shovel. In the same year, Wong starred in &quot;The Silk Bouquet&quot;. Re-titled &quot;The Dragon Horse&quot; in 1927, the film was one of the first U.S. films to be produced with Chinese backing, provided by San Francisco&#x27;s Chinese Six Companies. The story was set in China during the Ming dynasty and featured Asian actors playing the Asian roles.

Wong continued to be assigned supporting roles. Hollywood&#x27;s Asian female characters tended toward two stereotypical poles: the naïve and self-sacrificing &quot;Butterfly&quot; and the sly and deceitful &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;. In &quot;Old San Francisco&quot; (1927), directed by Alan Crosland for Warner Brothers, Wong played a &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;, a gangster&#x27;s daughter. In &quot;Mr. Wu&quot; (1927), she played a supporting role as increasing censorship against mixed-race onscreen couples cost her the lead. In &quot;The Crimson City&quot;, released the following year, this happened again.

===Move to Europe===
Tired of being both typecast and passed over for lead Asian character roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe. Interviewed by Doris Mackie for &quot;Film Weekly&quot; in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: &quot;I was so tired of the parts I had to play.&quot; She commented: &quot;There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles.&quot;

In Europe, Wong became a sensation, starring in notable films such as &quot;Schmutziges Geld&quot; (aka &quot;Song&quot; and &quot;Show Life&quot;, 1928), &quot;Großstadtschmetterling&quot; (&quot;Pavement Butterfly&quot;, 1929) and &quot;Der Weg zur Schande&quot; (&quot;The Road to Dishonour&quot;, 1930), all three directed by Richard Eichberg. Of the German critics&#x27; response to &quot;Song&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Wong was &quot;acclaimed not only as an actress of transcendent talent but as a great beauty&quot;. The article noted that Germans passed over Wong&#x27;s American background: &quot;Berlin critics, who were unanimous in praise of both the star and the production, neglect to mention that Anna May is of American birth. They mention only her Chinese origins.&quot; In Vienna, she played the title role in the operetta &quot;Tschun Tschi&quot; in fluent German. An Austrian critic wrote, &quot;Fräulein Wong had the audience perfectly in her power and the unobtrusive tragedy of her acting was deeply moving, carrying off the difficult German-speaking part very successfully.&quot;

While in Germany, Wong became a friend of Leni Riefenstahl, who was at that time an actor and had not yet taken up film directing. Her close friendships with several women throughout her life, including Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Cunningham, led to rumors of lesbianism which damaged her public reputation. These rumors, in particular of her supposed relationship with Dietrich, further embarrassed Wong&#x27;s family. They had long been opposed to her acting career, which was not considered an entirely respectable profession at the time.

London producer Basil Dean brought the play &quot;A Circle of Chalk&quot; for Wong to appear in with the young Laurence Olivier, her first stage performance in the United Kingdom. Criticism of her California accent, described by one critic as a &quot;Yankee squeak&quot;, led to Wong seeking vocal tutoring at Cambridge University, where she trained in received pronunciation. Composer Constant Lambert, infatuated with the actress after having seen her in films, attended the play on its opening night and subsequently composed &quot;Eight Poems of Li Po&quot;, dedicated to her.

Wong made her last silent film, &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, in 1929, the first of five British films in which she had a starring role. The film caused a sensation in the UK. Gilda Gray was the top-billed actress, but &quot;Variety&quot; commented that Wong &quot;outshines the star&quot; and that &quot;from the moment Miss Wong dances in the kitchen&#x27;s rear, she steals &#x27;Piccadilly&#x27; from Miss Gray.&quot; Though the film presented Wong in her most sensual role yet of the five films, once again she was not permitted to kiss her white love interest and a controversial planned scene involving a kiss was cut before the film was released. Forgotten for decades after its release, &quot;Piccadilly&quot; was later restored by the British Film Institute. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss calls &quot;Piccadilly&quot; Wong&#x27;s best film, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; reports that the rediscovery of this film and Wong&#x27;s performance in it has been responsible for a restoration of the actress&#x27; reputation.

While in London, Wong was romantically linked with writer and broadcasting executive Eric Maschwitz, who wrote the lyrics to &quot;These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)&quot;, possibly as an evocation of his longing for her after they parted. Wong&#x27;s first talkie was &quot;The Flame of Love&quot; (1930), which she recorded in French, English, and German. Though Wong&#x27;s performance⁠—particularly her handling of the three languages⁠—was lauded, all three versions of the film received negative reviews.

===Return to Hollywood===

During the 1930s, American studios were looking for fresh European talent. Ironically, Wong caught their eye, and she was offered a contract with Paramount Studios in 1930. Enticed by the promise of lead roles and top billing, she returned to the United States. The prestige and training she had gained during her years in Europe led to a starring role on Broadway in &quot;On the Spot&quot;, a drama that ran for 167 performances and which she would later film as &quot;Dangerous to Know&quot;. When the play&#x27;s director wanted Wong to use stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, derived from &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, in her performance of a Chinese character, Wong refused. She instead used her knowledge of Chinese style and gestures to imbue the character with a greater degree of authenticity. Following her return to Hollywood in 1930, Wong repeatedly turned to the stage and cabaret for a creative outlet.

In November 1930, Wong&#x27;s mother was struck and killed by an automobile in front of the Figueroa Street house. The family remained at the house until 1934 when Wong&#x27;s father returned to his hometown in China with Anna May&#x27;s younger brothers and sister. Anna May had been paying for the education of her younger siblings, who put their education to work after they relocated to China. Before the family left, Wong&#x27;s father wrote a brief article for &quot;Xinning&quot;, a magazine for overseas Taishanese, in which he expressed his pride in his famous daughter.
With the promise of appearing in a Josef von Sternberg film, Wong accepted another stereotypical role – the title character of Fu Manchu&#x27;s vengeful daughter in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931). This was the last stereotypically &quot;evil Chinese&quot; role Wong played, and also her one starring appearance alongside the only other well-known Asian actor of the era, Sessue Hayakawa. Though she was given the starring role, this status was not reflected in her paycheck: she was paid $6,000, while Hayakawa received $10,000 and Warner Oland, who is only in the film for 23 minutes, was paid $12,000.

Wong began using her newfound celebrity to make political statements: late in 1931, for example, she wrote a harsh criticism of the Mukden Incident and Japan&#x27;s subsequent invasion of Manchuria. She also became more outspoken in her advocacy for Chinese-American causes and for better film roles. In a 1933 interview for &quot;Film Weekly&quot; entitled &quot;I Protest&quot;, Wong criticized the negative stereotyping in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot;, saying, &quot;Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain—murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?&quot;

Wong appeared alongside Marlene Dietrich as a self-sacrificing courtesan in Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;. Her sexually charged scenes with Dietrich have been noted by many commentators and fed rumors about the relationship between the two stars. Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich&#x27;s acting and Sternberg&#x27;s direction, film historians today judge that Wong&#x27;s performance upstaged that of Dietrich.

The Chinese press had long given Wong&#x27;s career very mixed reviews, and were less than favorable to her performance in &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;. A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: &quot;Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China&quot; and continued, &quot;Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she has done more than enough to disgrace the Chinese race.&quot; Critics in China believed that Wong&#x27;s on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women. The most virulent criticism came from the Nationalist government, but China&#x27;s intellectuals and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when Peking University awarded the actress an honorary doctorate in 1932. Contemporary sources reported that this was probably the only time that an actor had been so honored.

In both America and Europe, Wong had been seen as a fashion icon for over a decade. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her &quot;The World&#x27;s best-dressed woman&quot; and in 1938 &quot;Look&quot; magazine named her &quot;The World&#x27;s most beautiful Chinese girl&quot;.

===Atlantic crossings===
After her success in Europe and a prominent role in &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;, Wong&#x27;s Hollywood career returned to its old pattern. She was passed over for the leading female role in &quot;The Son-Daughter&quot; in favor of Helen Hayes; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deemed her &quot;too Chinese to play a Chinese&quot; in the film. Wong was scheduled to play the role of a mistress to a corrupt Chinese general in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&quot; (1933), but the role went instead to Toshia Mori.
Again disappointed with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed for nearly three years. In addition to appearing in four films, she toured Scotland and Ireland as part of a vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film &quot;Java Head&quot; (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong&#x27;s biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong&#x27;s personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, one of the most famous stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.

In the 1930s, the popularity of Pearl Buck&#x27;s novels, especially &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, as well as growing American sympathy for China in its struggles with Japanese imperialism, opened up opportunities for more positive Chinese roles in U.S. films. Wong returned to the U.S. in June 1935 with the goal of obtaining the role of O-lan, the lead female character in MGM&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. Since its publication in 1931, Wong had made known her desire to play O-lan in a film version of the book; and as early as 1933, Los Angeles newspapers were touting Wong as the best choice for the part.

Nevertheless, the studio apparently never seriously considered Wong for the role. The Chinese government also advised the studio against casting Wong in the role. The Chinese advisor to MGM commented: &quot;whenever she appears in a movie, the newspapers print her picture with the caption &#x27;Anna May again loses face for China&#x27; &quot;.

According to Wong, she was instead offered the part of Lotus, a deceitful song girl who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family&#x27;s oldest son. Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production Irving Thalberg, &quot;If you let me play O-lan, I will be very glad. But you&#x27;re asking me—with Chinese blood—to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters.&quot;

The role Wong hoped for went to Luise Rainer, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong&#x27;s sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film in the role of the Little Bride. MGM&#x27;s refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as &quot;one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s&quot;.

===Chinese tour and rising popularity===
After the major disappointment of losing the role in &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong&#x27;s father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. Aside from Mei Lanfang&#x27;s offer to teach her, she wanted to learn more about the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on her departure, &quot;... for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality.&quot;

Embarking in January 1936, Wong chronicled her experiences in a series of articles printed in U.S. newspapers such as the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;Photoplay&quot;. In a stopover in Tokyo on the way to Shanghai, local reporters, ever curious about her romantic life, asked if she had marriage plans, to which Wong replied, &quot;No, I am wedded to my art.&quot; The following day, however, Japanese newspapers reported that Wong was married to a wealthy Cantonese man named &quot;Art&quot;.

During her travels in China, Wong continued to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating in many areas of China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded &quot;as strange to me as Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter.&quot;

The toll of international celebrity on Wong&#x27;s personal life manifested itself in bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: &quot;Down with Huang Liu-tsong—the stooge that disgraces China. Don&#x27;t let her go ashore.&quot; Wong began crying and a stampede ensued.

After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited his family and his first wife at the family&#x27;s ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10 days in the family&#x27;s village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China.

After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: &quot;I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It&#x27;s a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I&#x27;m &#x27;too American&#x27; and by American producers, because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts.&quot; Wong&#x27;s father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.

===Late 1930s and further work films===
To complete her contract with Paramount Pictures, Wong made a string of B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles that were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters.

Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these characters worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong&#x27;s film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; (1937) and &quot;King of Chinatown&quot; (1939).

In &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot;, Wong played the Asian-American female lead in a role that was rewritten for her as the heroine of the story, actively setting the plot into motion rather than the more passive character originally planned. The script was so carefully tailored for Wong that at one point it was given the working title &quot;Anna May Wong Story&quot;. When the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2006, the announcement described it as &quot;more truly Wong&#x27;s personal vehicle than any of her other films&quot;.

Of this film, Wong told &quot;Hollywood Magazine&quot;, &quot;I like my part in this picture better than any I&#x27;ve had before ... because this picture gives Chinese a break—we have sympathetic parts for a change! To me, that means a great deal.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a generally positive review, commenting of its B-movie origins, &quot;An unusually competent cast saves the film from the worst consequences of certain inevitable banalities. [The cast] ... combine with effective sets to reduce the natural odds against any pictures in the &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; tradition.&quot;

In October 1937, the press carried rumors that Wong had plans to marry her male co-star in this film, childhood friend and Korean-American actor Philip Ahn. Wong replied, &quot;It would be like marrying my brother.&quot;

Bosley Crowther was not so kind to &quot;Dangerous to Know&quot; (1938), which he called a &quot;second-rate melodrama, hardly worthy of the talents of its generally capable cast&quot;. In &quot;King of Chinatown,&quot; Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Frank Nugent gave the film a negative review. Though he commented positively on its advocacy of the Chinese in their fight against Japan, he wrote, &quot;... Paramount should have spared us and its cast ... the necessity of being bothered with such folderol&quot;.

Paramount also employed Wong as a tutor to other actors, such as Dorothy Lamour in her role as a Eurasian in &quot;Disputed Passage&quot;. Wong performed on radio several times, including a 1939 role as &quot;Peony&quot; in Pearl Buck&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&quot; on Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. Wong&#x27;s cabaret act, which included songs in Cantonese, French, English, German, Danish, Swedish, and other languages, took her from the U.S. to Europe and Australia through the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1938, after she auctioned off her movie costumes and donated the money to Chinese aid, the Chinese Benevolent Association of California honored Wong for her work in support of Chinese refugees. The proceeds from the preface that she wrote in 1942 to a cookbook entitled &quot;New Chinese Recipes&quot;, one of the first Chinese cookbooks, were also dedicated to United China Relief. Between 1939 and 1942, she made few films, instead engaging in events and appearances in support of the Chinese struggle against Japan.

Being sick of the negative typecasting that had enveloped her throughout her American career, Wong visited Australia for more than three months in 1939. There she was the star attraction in a vaudeville show entitled &#x27;Highlights from Hollywood&#x27; at the Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne. On July 25, 1940, Wong&#x27;s sister Mary committed suicide by hanging herself in California.

===Later years and 1942 film success===
Wong attended several socialite events at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California, in 1941.

Wong starred in &quot;Bombs over Burma&quot; (1942) and &quot;Lady from Chungking&quot; (1942), both anti-Japanese propaganda made by the poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation. She donated her salary for both films to United China Relief. &quot;The Lady from Chungking&quot; differed from the usual Hollywood war film in that the Chinese were portrayed as heroes rather than as victims rescued by Americans. Even after American characters are captured by the Japanese, the primary goal of the heroes is not to free the Americans, but to prevent the Japanese from entering the city of Chongqing (Chungking). Also, in an interesting twist, the Chinese characters are portrayed by Chinese-American actors, while the Japanese villains—normally played by Chinese-American actors—are acted by European Americans. The film ends with Wong making a speech for the birth of a &quot;new China&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; both gave Wong&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Lady from Chungking&quot; positive reviews but commented negatively on the film&#x27;s plot.

A Democrat, Wong was supportive of Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

Later in life, Wong invested in real estate and owned a number of properties in Hollywood. She converted her home on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica into four apartments that she called &quot;Moongate Apartments&quot;. She served as the apartment house manager from the late 1940s until 1956, when she moved in with her brother Richard on 21st Place in Santa Monica.

In 1949, Wong&#x27;s father died in Los Angeles at the age of 91. After a six-year absence, Wong returned to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called &quot;Impact&quot;. From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series &quot;The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong&quot;, in which she played the title role that used her birth name. Wong&#x27;s character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The thirteen half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30 pm. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of menopause, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.

In 1956, Wong hosted one of the first U.S. documentaries on China narrated entirely by a Chinese American. Broadcast on the ABC travel series &quot;Bold Journey&quot;, the program consisted of film footage from her 1936 trip to China. Wong also did guest spots on television series such as &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, and &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;.

For her contribution to the film industry, Anna May Wong received a star at 1708 Vine Street on the inauguration of the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. She was the first Asian-American actress to receive this honor. She is also depicted larger-than-life as one of the four supporting pillars of the &quot;Gateway to Hollywood&quot; sculpture located on the southeast corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, with the actresses Dolores del Río (Hispanic American), Dorothy Dandridge (African American), and Mae West (White American).

In 1960, Wong returned to film in &quot;Portrait in Black&quot;, starring Lana Turner. She still found herself stereotyped, with one press release explaining her long absence from films with a supposed proverb, which was claimed to have been passed down to Wong by her father: &quot;Don&#x27;t be photographed too much or you&#x27;ll lose your soul&quot;, a quote that would be inserted into many of her obituaries.

===Later life and death===
Wong was scheduled to play the role of Madame Liang in the film production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, but was unable to take the role owing to her health problems. On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Wong died of a heart attack as she slept at home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on television&#x27;s &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Dragon by the Tail&quot;. (Wong had appeared in another story in the same series the previous year.) Her cremated remains were interred in her mother&#x27;s grave at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother&#x27;s Anglicized name on top, and the Chinese names of Anna May (on the right) and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.

==Legacy==

Wong&#x27;s image and career have left a notable legacy. Through her films, public appearances and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Chinese Americans to mainstream American audiences during a period of intense racism and discrimination. Chinese Americans had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society, but Wong&#x27;s films and public image established her as a Chinese-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Chinese immigration and citizenship. Wong&#x27;s hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.

Among Wong&#x27;s films, only &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; retained critical attention in the U.S. in the decades after her death. In Europe and especially England, her films appeared occasionally at festivals. Wong remained popular with the gay community, who claimed her as one of their own and for whom her marginalization by the mainstream became a symbol. Although the Chinese Nationalist criticism of her portrayals of the &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; stereotypes lingered, she was forgotten in China. Nevertheless, the importance of Wong&#x27;s legacy within the Asian-American film community can be seen in the Anna May Wong Award of Excellence, which is given yearly at the Asian-American Arts Awards; the annual award given out by the Asian Fashion Designers group was also named after Wong in 1973.

Wong&#x27;s image remained as a symbol in literature as well as in the film. In the 1971 poem &quot;The Death of Anna May Wong&quot;, Jessica Hagedorn saw Wong&#x27;s career as one of &quot;tragic glamour&quot; and portrayed the actress as a &quot;fragile maternal presence, an Asian-American woman who managed to &#x27;birth&#x27;, however ambivalently, Asian-American screen women in the jazz age&quot;. Wong&#x27;s character in &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; was the subject of John Yau&#x27;s 1989 poem &quot;No One Ever Tried to Kiss Anna May Wong&quot;, which interprets the actress&#x27; career as a series of tragic romances. Sally Wen Mao wrote a book called Oculus, published in 2019, with a series of persona poems in the voice of Anna May Wong. In David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1993 film version of David Henry Hwang&#x27;s 1986 play, &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, Wong&#x27;s image was used briefly as a symbol of a &quot;tragic diva&quot;. Her life was the subject of &quot;China Doll, The Imagined Life of an American Actress&quot;, an award-winning fictional play written by Elizabeth Wong in 1995.

In 1995, film historian Stephen Bourne curated a retrospective of Wong&#x27;s films called &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; for BFI Southbank.

As the centennial of Wong&#x27;s birth approached, a re-examination of her life and career took shape; three major works on the actress appeared and comprehensive retrospectives of her films were held at both the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. Anthony Chan&#x27;s 2003 biography, &quot;Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905–1961)&quot;, was the first major work on Wong and was written, Chan says, &quot;from a uniquely Asian-American perspective and sensibility&quot;. In 2004, Philip Leibfried and Chei Mi Lane&#x27;s exhaustive examination of Wong&#x27;s career, &quot;Anna May Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work&quot; was published, as well as a second full-length biography, &quot;Anna May Wong: From Laundryman&#x27;s Daughter to Hollywood Legend&quot; by Graham Russell Hodges. Though Anna May Wong&#x27;s life, career, and legacy reflect many complex issues which remain decades after her death, Anthony Chan points out that her place in Asian-American cinematic history, as its first female star, is permanent. An illustrated biography for children, &quot;Shining Star: The Anna May Wong Story&quot;, was published in 2009.

In 2016, the novelist Peter Ho Davies published &quot;The Fortunes&quot;, a saga of Chinese-American experiences centered around four characters, one of whom is a fictionalized Anna May Wong, imagined from childhood until her death. In a conversation published in the 2017 paperback edition, Davies described his novel as an exploration of the Chinese-American quest for authenticity—a third way of being Chinese American—with Anna May Wong representing an iconic example of that struggle.

On January 22, 2020, a Google Doodle celebrated Wong, commemorating the 97th anniversary of the day &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot; went into general release.

In 2020, actress Michelle Krusiec played Wong in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s Netflix drama series, &quot;Hollywood&quot;. The limited series tells an alternate history of Hollywood in the 1940s. Also in 2020, her life story was told as part of PBS&#x27;s documentary &quot;Asian Americans.&quot;

In 2021, the United States Mint announced that Wong would be among the first women depicted on the reverse of the quarter coin as a part of the American Women quarters series. When the quarters with her depicted on them went into circulation in 2022, Wong became the first Asian American depicted on American coinage.

In Damien Chazelle&#x27;s film &quot;Babylon&quot; (2022), Li Jun Li played Lady Fay Zhu, a role inspired by Wong.

In 2023, Mattel released a Barbie doll modeled on Wong in honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

In 2024, a third full-length biography titled &quot;Not Your China Doll: The Wild and Shimmering Life of Anna May Wong&quot; by Katie Gee Salisbury was published. The book, as well as the author&#x27;s Substack, debunks theories advanced by Chan, Hodges, and other scholars that Wong was bisexual.

A biopic from Working Title Films is in development, with British actress Gemma Chan set to portray Wong.

<text>Silicon Integrated Systems (SiS; ) is a company that manufactures, among other things, motherboard chipsets. The company was founded in 1987 in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan.

==Business==
In the late 1990s, SiS made the decision to invest in their own chip fabrication facilities. At the end of 1999, SiS acquired Rise Technology and its mP6 x86 core technology.

==Mainboard chipsets==

One of the most famous chipsets produced by SiS was the late 486-age chipset 496/497 which supported PCI bus among older ISA- and VLB-buses. Mainboards using this chipset and equipped with CPUs such as the Intel 80486DX4, AMD 5x86 or Cyrix Cx5x86 processors had performance and compatibility comparable with early Intel Pentium systems in addition to a lower price.

After this late success, SiS continued positioning itself as a budget chipset producer. The company emphasized high integration to minimize the cost to implement their solutions. As such, SiS one-chip mainboard chipsets that included integrated video, such as the Socket 7-based SiS 5596, SiS 5598, and SiS 530 along with the Slot 1-based SiS 620. These were some of the first PC chipsets with such high integration. They allowed entire system solutions to be built with just a mainboard, system RAM, and a CPU.

=== 386 &amp; 486 (Socket 1, 2, 3)===
* SiS 310,320,330 &quot;Rabbit&quot;
* SiS 401/402 ISA
* SiS 406/411 EISA, Vesa Local Bus
* SiS 460 ISA, Vesa Local Bus
* SiS 461 ISA, Vesa Local Bus
* SiS 471 ISA, Vesa Local Bus
* SiS 496/497 ISA, VLB, PCI

=== Pentium (Socket 4,5,7)===

*SiS 501/502/503 ISA, PCI
*SiS 5511/5512/5513 ISA, PCI
*SiS 5571 ISA, PCI
*SiS 5581 ISA, PCI
*SiS 5582 ISA, PCI
*SiS 5591/5595 ISA, PCI, AGP
The SiS 530 (Sindbad) with SiS 5595 southbridge supported Socket 7, SDRAM 1.5 GB max., a bus frequency from 66 MHz to 124 MHz, and can have from 2 to 8 MiB shared memory for an integrated AGP SiS 6306 2D/3D graphics controller. Includes integrated UDMA66 IDE controller. mainboards using the SiS 530 were positioned as cheap office platforms and paired often with low-cost chips from Intel competitors, such as the AMD K6 series or Cyrix 6x86. The graphics controller had Direct3D 6.0 and OpenGL support, although it was a very low-performance product for 3D acceleration.

SiS 540 (Spartan) integrates SiS 300 graphics controller.

===Socket 370, Slot 1===
* SiS 600/SiS 5595
* SiS 620/SiS 5595
* SiS 630 - includes North- and South bridges (SiS 960) and 2D/3D graphics controller (SiS 305) on one chip
* SiS 633
* SiS 635

===Socket 478, Socket 775===
SiS and ALi were the only two companies initially awarded licenses to produce third party chipsets for the Pentium 4. SiS developed the 648 chipset with this license (SiS 648 B Stepping supports Intel Hyper-Threading CPU on some motherboards like MSI 648 Max).

===Socket A (Socket 462), Slot A===

===Socket 940, 754, 939, AM2===
Memory support is dependent on the CPU
SiS created a multimedia chipset for the Xbox 360.

==Southbridge chips==

Paired with later SiS chipsets, such as the 661GX/761GX, which adopt a standard two-chip chipset design (instead of single-chip, like the older SiS 630/730 series chipsets). SiS southbridges can handle IDE, LAN (accompanied by a PHY chip), audio (with an AC&#x27;97 codec), along with other types of I/O. SiS&#x27; proprietary MuTIOL interconnect connects the southbridge chip to the northbridge, which contains the RAM controller (for chipsets targeted at Intel platforms) and interfaces with the CPU.

==Graphics chipsets==
=== Discrete 3D Graphics chips ===
=== Integrated 3D Graphics ===
* 1Pixel shaders: vertex shaders: texture mapping units: render output units

Some cards contain a 3D graphics accelerator but it is only functional with the SiS&#x27;s Proprietary Windows-only driver (the company does not provide documentation for others to write drivers). However, the Linux kernel includes a working third party driver that, while not supporting 3D gaming, makes the cards usable under Linux.

<doc id="781018" wikidata="Q4761306" url="?curid=781018" title="Andy Seminick">
<text>Andrew Wasal Seminick (September 12, 1920 – February 22, 2004) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies between 1943 and 1951, and the Cincinnati Reds/Redlegs from 1952 through part of 1955, when he rejoined the Phillies for the rest of his career until his release at the end of the 1957 season. Seminick was an integral part of the 1950 &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; Phillies team that won their first pennant since .

==Playing career==

Seminick was born in Pierce, West Virginia to Lemko immigrant parents, but moved to Muse, Pennsylvania when Andy was two. His father was a Rusyn from Żegiestów in Nowy Sacz County. He was contracted as an amateur free agent in 1941 by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Seminick led the Appalachian League in 1942 with 15 home runs and 202 total bases, and was among the league leaders in batting average. In , he had a .303 batting average with the Knoxville Smokies of the Class-A Southern Association, and was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies.

At the age of 23, Seminick made his major league debut on September 14, 1943. By 1945, the Phillies were using Seminick in a platoon system alongside veteran catcher Gus Mancuso. While he could hit for power, his defensive skills were below average, as he led the National League in errors in 1946, 1948 and 1949. Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer assigned Phillies coach and former catcher Cy Perkins to tutor him, which helped improve his defensive skills. He was voted by baseball fans to be the starting catcher for the National League in the All-Star Game, mostly for his reputation as a hitter.

On June 2, , the Phillies hit five home runs during the eighth inning in a 12–3 victory over Cincinnati at Shibe Park, tying the major league mark set by the 1939 New York Giants. Seminick hit two home runs in the inning, while Del Ennis, Willie Jones and Schoolboy Rowe had one each. Jones added a triple as Granny Hamner&#x27;s double jumped the extra bases total to 18, still a record. Seminick collected three home runs overall.

With his defensive and pitch calling skills improved, Seminick played an important leadership role during the 1950 &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; championship season. Because he was, at 29, one of the veterans on the squad and was called upon to handle a young Phillie pitching staff, Philadelphia baseball writers nicknamed Seminick &quot;Grandpa Whiz.&quot;

On August 12, 1950, in a game against the Giants, Seminick became irritated after Eddie Stanky repeatedly waved his arms while Seminick was batting. Stanky was eventually ejected from the game, but Seminick took out his frustrations on Bill Rigney, Stanky&#x27;s replacement at second base. After he reached base on an error in the fourth inning, he slid hard into second base, crashing into Rigney and causing him to fall over. A nearly ten-minute brawl erupted between the teams, which required police intervention and resulted in the ejection of Seminick and Rigney from the game. The Phillies went on to win 4–3.

Seminick enjoyed his best season in 1950, hitting for a .288 batting average with 24 home runs and 68 runs batted in. Seminick broke his ankle late in the season, but continued to play with the injury until the Phillies lost to the New York Yankees in the World Series. Future Hall of Fame pitcher, Robin Roberts said of Seminick,&quot;If you had to pick a guy in the clubhouse who was our leader that year, it would be Andy. He always played hard, and that was his best year by far&quot;.
In 1951, Seminick was beaned by a Max Lanier fastball, diminishing his ability to play. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for catcher Smoky Burgess, playing there from 1952 until the early part of the 1955 season. In 1955, he was once again traded for Burgess, returning to the Phillies, where he led National League catchers with a .994 fielding percentage. He played two more years before ending his playing career at the age of 36 after the 1957 season.

==Career statistics==
In a 15-year major league career, Seminick played in 1,304 games, totaling 953 hits in 3,921 at bats for a .243 batting average, with 164 home runs and 556 runs batted in. He threw out 44.6% of the base runners who tried steal a base on him, 16th on the all-time list. Seminick led National League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing and once each in putouts, assists and fielding percentage. At the time of his retirement, he ranked seventh all-time in home runs by catchers.

==Managing and coaching career==

After retiring as a player, Seminick worked for the Philadelphia organization for the rest of his life. He was a coach with the Phillies (1957–58, 1967–69) and manager of 11 minor-league affiliates (1959–66, 1970–73). After that, he served as a scout and as a roving minor-league instructor for the Phillies (1974–mid-1980s). Notably, ninety of the players he managed or coached eventually played in the major leagues, including Mike Schmidt, Ferguson Jenkins, Greg Luzinski and Bob Boone. Seminick helped to convert Boone from a third baseman to one of the best defensive catchers in baseball.

In the 1990s, Seminick served as a catching instructor for Philadelphia in spring training and in the Florida Instructional League.

Andy Seminick died in Palm Bay, Florida, at 83 years of age.

<doc id="781024" wikidata="Q1857766" url="?curid=781024" title="Current affairs (news format)">
<text>Current affairs is a genre of broadcast journalism in which major news stories are discussed at length in a timely manner.

This differs from regular news broadcasts that place emphasis on news reports presented for simple presentation as soon as possible, often with a minimum of analysis. It is also different from the news magazine show format in that the events are discussed immediately.

The UK&#x27;s BBC programmes such as &quot;This World&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;Real Story&quot;, &quot;BBC Scotland Investigates&quot;, &quot;Spotlight&quot;, &quot;Week In Week Out&quot;, and &quot;Inside Out&quot; fit the definition.

In Canada, CBC Radio produces a number of current affairs show both nationally such as &quot;The Current&quot; and &quot;As It Happens&quot; as well as regionally with morning current affairs shows such as &quot;Information Morning&quot;, a focus the radio network developed in the 1970s as a way to recapture audience from television.

In Australia, the aptly named &quot;A Current Affair&quot; developed by the Nine Network in the 1970s focuses on community issues not usually discussed by major news bulletins. Recurring stories include: hoons, dodgy tradies, neighbours from hell, and corruption. They also run numerous stories about local legends as well as various lifestyle tips. &quot;Today Tonight&quot; produced by the Seven Network from 1995 to 2019 was also similar in format, covering stories comparable to that of ACA.

Additionally, newspapers such as the &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Monocle&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Week&quot;, &quot;The Oldie&quot;, &quot;Investors Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Prospect&quot;, &quot;MoneyWeek&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;BBC History Magazine,&quot; and &quot;History Today&quot; are all sometimes referred to as current affairs magazines.

<text>A branch line is a secondary railway line which branches off a more important through route, usually a main line. A very short branch line may be called a spur line. Branch lines may serve one or more industries, or a city or town not located on a main line. Branch lines may also connect two or more main lines.

== Industrial spur ==

An industrial spur is a type of secondary track used by railroads to allow customers at a location to load and unload railcars without interfering with other railroad operations.

Industrial spurs can vary greatly in length and railcar capacity depending on the requirements of the customer the spur is serving. In heavily industrialized areas, it is not uncommon for one industrial spur to have multiple sidings to several different customers. Typically, spurs are serviced by local trains responsible for collecting small numbers of railcars and delivering them to a larger yard, where these railcars are sorted and dispatched in larger trains with other cars destined to similar locations. Because industrial spurs generally have less capacity and traffic than a mainline, they tend to have lower maintenance and signaling (train control) standards.

Before the rise of the long-distance trucking in the early 1930s, railroads were the primary means of transportation around the world. Industries of the era were commonly built along railroad lines specifically to allow for easy access to shipping. Short (under a mile, oftentimes only several hundred yards) industrial spurs with very small (under ten car) capacities were a common sight along railroads in industrial and rural cities alike. As automobile and roadway technology improved throughout the early and mid-20th century, most low volume industry spurs were abandoned in favor of the greater flexibility and economic savings of trucking. Today, railroads remain the most economical way to ship large quantities of material, a fact that is reflected in industrial spurs. Most modern day spurs serve very large industries that require hundreds, if not thousands, of carloads a year.

==Around the world==
===Europe===
There is an international branch line between Italy and Vatican: the 300-metre Vatican Railway, connecting from the Pisa-Rome railway mainline at Roma San Pietro railway station, to Vatican City station.

====United Kingdom====
Many British railway branch lines were closed as a result of the &quot;Beeching cuts&quot; in the 1960s, although some have been re-opened as heritage railways.

The smallest branch line that is still in operation in the UK is the Stourbridge Town Branch Line from Stourbridge Junction going to Stourbridge Town. Operating on a single track, the journey is long and the train takes around two and a half minutes to complete its journey.

===North America===

In North America, little-used branch lines are often sold by large railroads to become new common carrier short-line railroads of their own. Throughout the United States and Canada, branch lines link smaller towns too distant from the main line to be served efficiently, or to serve a certain industrial site such as a power station either because of a location away from the main line or to reduce congestion. They were typically built to lower standards, using lighter rail and shallow roadbeds when compared to main lines.

====Canada====
Much of Canada&#x27;s branch line history relates to large rail transport conglomerates (such as the Grand Trunk, Canadian National, or Canadian Pacific) which would acquire formerly independent short line railways for use as branch lines, with the short line often continuing to exist as a subsidiary. For example, when the Canadian Pacific acquired the Algoma Eastern Railway (a short line) in 1930, it soon after abandoned much of the Algoma Eastern mainline, but retained sections close to Algoma Eastern–Canadian Pacific junctions as short branch lines or spurs.

The &quot;National Transportation Act&quot; of 1967 provided government subsidies for branch lines. Western railway development in Canada worked in concert with land settlement and cultivation, as pioneers were settled near railway lines, often on land the railways had owned. However, by the mid-20th century, railways began neglecting lines in western agricultural regions. This was historically driven by factors such as the Crow Rate, which regulated the price railways could charge for shipping grain. Railways had little incentive to invest in rural Prairie branch lines, but were legally unable to abandon them under the &quot;National Transportation Act&quot;, which also did not provide a subsidy for grain transport, and instead allowed railways to absorb branch line subsidies freely without making effort to improve the profitability of the lines. The term &quot;grain-dependent branch lines&quot; began being used as early as 1978 to refer to the special case of these branch lines in agricultural areas whose viability depended on the economics of grain transport. The &quot;Western Grain Transportation Act&quot; of 1983 addressed this case specifically, but was repealed in 1994 in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement and budget-balancing initiatives in favour of a one-time payout by the federal government directly to farmers, to arrange transport of grain themselves. From the mid-1970s to the late 2010s, more than of Prairie branch lines were abandoned or had a discontinuance of service.

David Blyth Hanna, the first president of the Canadian National Railway, said that although most branch lines cannot pay for themselves, they are even essential to make main lines pay.

====United States====
In the United States, abandonment of unproductive branch lines was a byproduct of deregulation of the rail industry through the &quot;Staggers Act&quot;.

The Princeton Branch is a commuter rail line and service owned and operated by New Jersey Transit (NJT) in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The line is a short branch of the Northeast Corridor Line, running from Princeton Junction northwest to Princeton with no intermediate stops. Also known as the &quot;Dinky Line&quot;, at it is the shortest scheduled commuter rail line in the United States. The run takes 4 minutes, 47 seconds.

Other than the Princeton Line, other surviving branch lines include the Gladstone Branch in New Jersey; as well as the New Canaan Branch, Danbury Branch, and Waterbury Branch in Connecticut. The Long Island Rail Road also refers to its services as &quot;branches&quot;.

===South America===
====Chile====
In Chile, there are many branch lines on its main line, but only a few remain operational. Most only operating in touristic services (like the Antilhue-Valdivia branch line), others have been taken over by other railways (like the San Rosendo-Talcahuano branch line, which has been taken over by Biotrén and the Laja-Talcahuano train service) however, there is one branch line that still remains as fully operative. The Talca-Constitución branch line, which uses trains with bus motors.

===Asia===
====Hong Kong====
Two extensions to the MTR rapid transit network were built as branches of existing lines: the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line to Lok Ma Chau station, which opened in 2007; and the South Tseung Kwan O Spur Line to LOHAS Park station, opened in 2009.

Earlier, a spur line was built in 1985 on the East Rail line to serve Racecourse station, bypassing Fo Tan station.

Also, the was built in 2004 on the East Rail line to serve East Tsim Sha Tsui station. However, after the Kowloon Southern Link was completed in 2009, this spur line turns into a section of the West Rail line.

Discontinued services include the Sha Tau Kok Railway and the Wo Hop Shek Branch.

A spur line to Siu Sai Wan has been proposed.

Delhi

On the Delhi Metro, the Blue Line has a Branch Line with 8 Stations, linking Yamuna Bank to Ghaziabad via Anand Vihar ISBT and terminating at Vaishali.

The first section of the Branch opened on 8 January 2010 with Anand Vihar as its terminal with six stations. It was further extended to Vaishali in 2011. The line is planned to be extended from Vaishali to Mohan Nagar via Sahibabad Station to link with the main line.

====Singapore====
The East West Line of the MRT system in Singapore has a two-station branch to Changi Airport. The first station, Expo, opened in 2001. It was extended to Changi Airport station the next year.

From 1990 to 1996, the section of the North South Line between Jurong East and Choa Chu Kang stations was operated as a separate line, known as the Branch line. It was merged into the North–South Line with the opening of the Woodlands Extension in 1996. The future Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line will also have branch lines.

===Australasia===
====New Zealand====

New Zealand once had a very extensive network of branch lines, especially in the South Island regions of Canterbury, Otago, and Southland. Many were built in the late 19th century to open up inland regions for farming and other economic activities. The branches in the South Island regions were often general-purpose lines that carried predominantly agricultural traffic, but lines elsewhere were often built to serve a specific resource: on the West Coast, an extensive network of branch lines was built in rugged terrain to serve coal mines, while in the central North Island and the Bay of Plenty Region, lines were built inland to provide rail access to large logging operations.

Today, many of the branch lines have been closed, including almost all of the general-purpose country lines. Those that remain serve ports or industries far from main lines such as coal mines, logging operations, large dairying factories, and steelworks. In Auckland and Wellington, two branch lines in each city exist solely for commuter passenger trains. For more, see the list of New Zealand railway lines.

<text>The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, honors players who have shown exceptional skill at basketball, all-time great coaches, referees, and other major contributors to the sport. It is named after James Naismith, who conceived the sport in 1891; he was inducted into the Hall as a contributor in 1959. To be considered for induction, nominees must meet certain prerequisites. Players must have been retired for at least three years before becoming eligible. Referees must have either been retired for at least three years, or, if they are still active, have officiated for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher. Coaches must have either been retired for at least three years, or, if they are still active, have coached for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher and from 2020 on must have coached for at least 25 years and reached the age of sixty years. Those being considered for induction as contributors may be inducted at any time; the Hall of Fame and its committees evaluate whether contributions are significant enough for the nominee to be inducted as a contributor. Teams are also inducted at the committees&#x27; discretion.

==Members==
===Coaches===

As part of the inaugural class of 1959, three coaches were inducted (Forrest C. &quot;Phog&quot; Allen, Henry Clifford Carlson and Walter E. Meanwell); in total, 100 coaches have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ten of the inducted coaches were born outside the United States: Cesare Rubini (Italy, 1994), Alexander Gomelsky (Soviet Union, now Russia, 1995), Antonio Díaz-Miguel (Spain, 1997), Aleksandar &quot;Aca&quot; Nikolić (Yugoslavia, now Serbia, 1998), Geno Auriemma (Italy, 2006), Alessandro &quot;Sandro&quot; Gamba (Italy, 2006), Mirko Novosel (Yugoslavia, now Croatia, 2007), Pedro Ferrándiz (Spain, 2007), Lidia Alexeeva (Soviet Union, now Russia, 2012), and Lindsay Gaze (Australia, 2015). Six of them have won championships in the EuroLeague or its historic predecessor, the FIBA European Champions Cup. Ten of the inducted coaches are women: L. Margaret Wade (1985), Jody Conradt (1998), Pat Head Summitt (2000), Sandra Kay Yow (2002), Sue Gunter (2005), Cathy Rush (2008), C. Vivian Stringer (2009), Tara VanDerveer (2011), Alexeeva (2012), and Sylvia Hatchell (2013). Five coaches have also been inducted as players: John Wooden, Bill Sharman, Lenny Wilkens, Tom Heinsohn, and Bill Russell. The most recent coaches to be inducted are Tom Izzo and John McLendon; the latter, inducted as a contributor in 1979, is the first individual to be inducted separately as a coach and contributor.

Most of the inductees have been college head coaches. Thirty-two have led a team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men&#x27;s championship and six have led a team to the NCAA women&#x27;s championship. Twenty inductees have coached in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Twelve of them have won at least one NBA championship as head coaches; one other, Don Nelson, has five NBA championships as a player. Additionally, Bobby &quot;Slick&quot; Leonard won three titles in the former American Basketball Association. Larry Brown is the only inductee to coach both a college basketball team and a professional basketball team to a title, having coached the Kansas Jayhawks (NCAA) and the Detroit Pistons (NBA) to championships.

Six coaching inductees have received the Hall&#x27;s John Bunn Award, given annually for significant contributions to the sport—Red Auerbach, Henry Iba, Ray Meyer, Summitt, Wooden, and Morgan Wootten.

Twelve inductees have, either before or after their induction, won an Olympic medal coaching a men&#x27;s national team to a top-three finish in the Olympic tournament. Eight coached the U.S. national team, while the other four coached foreign national teams. Six inductees—Summitt, Yow, Auriemma, Van Chancellor, VanDerveer, and Alexeeva—have led a women&#x27;s national team to a top-three finish in the Olympics. Alexeeva led the Soviet Union to two golds, while all the others led the United States to gold medals (Auriemma after his induction, the others before being inducted). The United States and the Soviet Union (including the Unified Team in 1992) are the only two teams to have won the Olympic basketball tournament: the U.S. in 1984, 1988, 1996–2020, and the USSR in 1976, 1980 and 1992.

Six individuals inducted as coaches were associated with teams that have been inducted to the Hall as units. Donald L. &quot;Don&quot; Haskins, inducted in 1997, was the head coach of the 1966 Texas Western basketball team, which was inducted into the Hall in 2007. Chuck Daly, inducted in 1994, was the head coach of the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, the USA team at the 1992 Olympics that featured 11 Hall of Fame players and was inducted as a unit in 2010. Wilkens, inducted as a coach in 1998, and Mike Krzyzewski, inducted in 2001, were Daly&#x27;s assistants in 1992. Dutch Lonborg, inducted in 1973, was team manager for the 1960 U.S. men&#x27;s Olympic team that was also inducted as a unit in 2010. Cathy Rush, inducted in 2008, was the head coach of the Immaculata College women&#x27;s team of 1972–1974 that was inducted in 2014.

===Contributors===
For a person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, they must have made &quot;significant contributions to the game of basketball&quot;. Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959, seven individuals were inducted as contributors, including James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. All former NBA commissioners (Maurice Podoloff, J. Walter Kennedy, Larry O&#x27;Brien, and David Stern) have been inducted. Seventeen individuals inducted as contributors have won the John Bunn Award, awarded by the Hall annually to a significant contributor: John Bunn (its inaugural recipient), J. Walter Kennedy, Cliff Fagan, Edward Gottlieb, Danny Biasone, Larry O&#x27;Brien, Dave Gavitt, C. M. Newton, Tex Winter, Meadowlark Lemon, Tom Jernstedt, Tom &quot;Satch&quot; Sanders, Val Ackerman, George Raveling, Al Attles, Rod Thorn and Del Harris. Four inductees in this category are women: Senda Berenson Abbott and Bertha Teague (both inducted in 1985), Rebecca Lobo (2017) and Val Ackerman (2021).

The exact number of individuals enshrined as contributors (as well as the number of player inductees) is subject to debate because of the Hall&#x27;s treatment of 2014 inductee Nathaniel &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton, one of the first African Americans to play in the NBA. While he was initially announced as a contributor, the Hall now classifies him as a player inductee.

Six inductees in this category were associated with teams that have been inducted to the Hall as units. Naismith organized The First Team, the group of players involved in the first-ever basketball game in 1891 and also inducted as part of the inaugural Class of 1959. Robert L. Douglas, inducted in 1972, was the founder and owner of the New York Renaissance, inducted in 1963. Pete Newell, inducted in 1979, was the head coach of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team inducted in 2010. Three were associated with the Harlem Globetrotters, inducted in 2002. Abe Saperstein, inducted in 1971, was the team&#x27;s founder and owner. Kennedy, although best known for his time as NBA commissioner, had been the Globetrotters&#x27; public relations director in the 1950s. Lemon, inducted in 2003, was one of the team&#x27;s most enduring on-court stars.

Ten individuals inducted in this category were born outside the United States—Naismith and Newell in Canada, Podoloff and Gottlieb in modern-day Ukraine (part of the Russian Empire when they were born in 1890 and 1898 respectively), Douglas in Saint Kitts and Nevis (part of the British West Indies at his birth in 1882), Saperstein in the United Kingdom, Biasone and Renato William Jones in Italy, Ferenc Hepp in modern-day Hungary (Austria-Hungary at his birth in 1909), and Borislav Stanković in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Kingdom of Yugoslavia at his birth in 1925).

In total 81 individuals have been inducted as contributors.

===Players===

As part of the inaugural class of 1959, four players were inducted, including George Mikan, who was the first NBA player to be enshrined. In total, 177 or 178 players, depending on Nathaniel Clifton&#x27;s classification, have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Of these, 110 or 111, again depending on Clifton&#x27;s classification, have played in the NBA. The 1993 class had the most player inductees, with eight. No players were inducted in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 2007. Five players have also been inducted as coaches: John Wooden in 1973, Lenny Wilkens in 1998, Bill Sharman in 2004, Tom Heinsohn in 2015, and Bill Russell in 2021.

Twenty-seven player inductees are women: Lusia Harris-Stewart (1992), Nera D. White (1992), Ann E. Meyers (1993), Uļjana Semjonova (1993), Carol A. Blazejowski (1994), Anne T.

Twenty player inductees were born outside the United States. Canadian-born Robert J. &quot;Bob&quot; Houbregs (inducted 1987) was drafted by NBA&#x27;s Milwaukee Hawks in 1953 and played five seasons in the league. Four inductees were born in the former Soviet Union: Sergei A. Belov, Šarūnas Marčiulionis, Arvydas Sabonis, and Uljana Semjonova. Belov, inducted in 1992, was born in modern-day Russia; Sabonis and Marčiulionis, respectively inducted in 2011 and 2014, were born in today&#x27;s Lithuania. All three players won gold medals for the USSR at the Olympic Games. Marčiulionis and Sabonis each added two bronze medals for Lithuania after the restoration of its independence in 1990; Marčiulionis is also credited by the Hall with resurrecting the Lithuania national team after independence. Semjonova, inducted in 1993, was born in what is now Latvia. She won two Olympic golds with the USSR women&#x27;s team.

Krešimir Ćosić, Dražen Petrović, Dražen Dalipagić, Dino Rađa, Vlade Divac, Toni Kukoč and Radivoj Korać (inducted in 1996, 2002, 2004, 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 respectively) represented Yugoslavia internationally during their careers. Petrović, Rađa and Kukoč represented Croatia after the initial breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. Italian-born Dino Meneghin (inducted 2003) spent his entire career playing in the Italian A League.

Three Brazilians have represented their homeland internationally: Hortência de Fatima Marcari (inducted in 2005) for the women&#x27;s national team, Maciel &quot;Ubiratan&quot; Pereira (inducted in 2010) and Oscar Schmidt (inducted in 2013) for the men&#x27;s national team. Mutombo (inducted in 2015) was born in the country now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Yao Ming, inducted in 2016, was born and raised in China.

American Dominique Wilkins, inducted in 2006, was born in France during his father&#x27;s posting in that country as a member of the U.S. Air Force. John Isaacs (inducted in 2015) was born in Panama but raised in Harlem. Although born in New Jersey, 2017 inductee Nikos Galis played the whole of his professional career in Greece. 2018 inductee Steve Nash was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and grew up in Canada.

===Referees===
The Referee category has existed since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first referee was inducted in 1959. Since then, seventeen referees have been inducted. Ernest C. Quigley, born in Canada, is the only inductee in this category born outside of the United States.
===Teams===
The Team category has existed since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first teams were inducted in 1959. Four teams were enshrined before 1963, but the fifth was not enshrined until 2002. All told, 13 teams have been inducted, with the most recent being the 1976 United States Women&#x27;s Olympic Team inducted in 2023.

<text>USS &quot;Leutze&quot; (DD-481) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Admiral Eugene H. C. Leutze (1847–1931).

&quot;Leutze&quot; was laid down on 3 June 1941 by Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington and launched 29 October 1942; sponsored by Miss Caroline Rowcliffe, granddaughter of Rear Adm. E. H. C. Leutze, daughter of Rear Adm. Gilbert Jonathan Rowcliff. The ship was commissioned 4 March 1944.

==History==
&quot;Leutze&quot; completed the necessary performance trials and continued the training of her crew on escort missions to Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok during June and July 1944. On 2 August she departed Seattle for the war zone a sleek new destroyer and returned 1 year and 1 day later a battered veteran about to be scrapped. In this short interval she had played a part in five invasions and a major naval battle before a kamikaze ended her fighting days.

After departing Seattle, Washington, the destroyer rehearsed in the Hawaiian and Solomon Islands for the invasion of the Palaus. Arriving off Peleliu 12 September (D-Day-3), &quot;Leutze&quot; bombarded enemy positions ashore and suffered her first casualty when shrapnel from an enemy shell sprayed the ship. Withdrawn on 24 September, she joined Task Group 77.2 (TG 77.2) at Manus Island, Admiralties, for the invasion of the strategically important Philippines.

Action off Leyte began 18 October with little serious opposition to the preinvasion bombardment but rose to a crescendo climax with the Battle of Leyte Gulf 24 and 25 October. &quot;Leutze&quot;, first firing on an enemy plane two days earlier, suffered 11 casualties on the morning of the 24th when hit during an enemy bombing and strafing run. That night in Surigao Straits with Rear Adm. Jesse B. Oldendorf’s 7th Fleet support ships, she attacked with torpedoes the ships of Japan’s Southern Force under Adm. Shoji Nishimura. During this phase of the last major battle between surface ships, Nishimura lost two battleships and three destroyers in a vain attempt to force his way through the Straits and attack the American invasion fleet. Thereafter with its surface fleet decimated, Japan again resorted to airstrikes. Although &quot;Leutze&quot; emerged unscratched, on a single day 1 November, four sister ships of her screen were crashed by suicide planes.

After a period of tender overhaul, she steamed out of Kossol Roads 1 January 1945 for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippines. En route the ship received ice cream for all hands for returning a sailor fallen overboard from . She arrived in Lingayen Gulf 6 January for fire support. While supporting this operation, &quot;Leutze&quot; 7 January sank a Japanese patrol vessel and 9 January a small suicide boat loaded with explosives.

Careful preparations were made for the next assault. Iwo Jima, desired as an airfield site, was selected as the target. Practicing with underwater demolition teams at Ulithi and conducting exercises until beyond Saipan, &quot;Leutze&quot; arrived Iwo Jima 16 February. Despite intensive previous bombing and shelling, enemy fire was heavy.

While protecting Navy frogmen on 17 February, she took, a shell on the after part of the forward stack. Remaining until the completion of her mission, she then transferred her seriously wounded commanding officer and three other injured and resumed station. In accordance with the Commanding Officer&#x27;s recommendation, Lt. Leon Grabowsky was elevated to Commanding Officer of Leutze. Upon assuming command on 17 January 1945, Grabowsky became the youngest modern destroyer commander ever in the US Navy at age 27 years, 4 months. Ordered back to Ulithi the next day for repairs, Leutze returned to Iwo Jima early in March but only for four days, as much of this fleet was now needed for Operation Iceberg, the conquest of Okinawa.

This last big amphibious operation of the war, unlike Iwo Jima, took place within range of Japanese land-based planes. While escorting battleship for the preinvasion shelling of 27 March, &quot;Leutze&quot; made two depth charge runs which apparently sank a midget submarine. On a second voyage with and , she arrived Okinawa 3 April. This was 2 days after D-Day but in time for the first of the Japanese operations &quot;Ten Go&quot;, the massed kamikaze attacks.

==Fate==

Of the first wave of attacking aircraft to filter through the outer screen on 6 April, she splashed two and later knocked down a third. Disregarding the danger, she proceeded alongside to assist the thrice-hit and burning . The fourth plane to hit this ship skidded across the deck and exploded its bomb against &quot;Leutze&quot;’s port quarter. The &quot;kamikaze&quot; almost severed her fantail and left seven crew members missing, one dead, and 30 wounded. Lt. Leon Grabowsky, &quot;Leutze&quot;’s acting commanding officer, received the Navy Cross for his part in aiding &quot;Newcomb&quot;, and in the fighting of his own ship.

Recalling her firefighting parties from &quot;Newcomb&quot;, she maneuvered clear, brought her flooding under control and was towed to Kerama Retto anchorage for emergency repairs. Departing 10 July via Guam and Pearl Harbor, she reached Hunters Point Drydocks, San Francisco, 3 August. Following the end of the war, her repairs were halted. &quot;Leutze&quot; decommissioned 6 December 1945, was struck from the Navy Register 3 January 1946, and ultimately purchased for scrap by Thomas Harris, Barber, New Jersey, 17 June 1947.

==Honors==
&quot;Leutze&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall (November 1, 1830 – July 3, 1892) was an American mathematician and suffragist. She was married to astronomer Asaph Hall and collaborated with her husband in searching for the moons of Mars, performing mathematical calculations on the data he collected.

==Early life==
Angeline Stickney was born to Theophilus Stickney and Electa Cook on November 1, 1830. In 1847, she took three terms of study funded by her cousin, Harriette Downs, at Rodman Union Seminary. Stickney was able to attend New-York Central College with help from her sister Ruth and by teaching at the college. She majored in science and mathematics, completed coursework in calculus and mathematical astronomy, and graduated with the college&#x27;s first class, in 1855. New-York Central College was a progressive school where students of modest means, including women and free African Americans, could earn a college degree. It was here that she became passionate about the causes of women&#x27;s suffrage and the abolition of slavery.

Angeline Stickney and Asaph Hall met at Central College. Stickney was two years ahead of Hall. She was his instructor in geometry and German. During their days together as teacher and student, Hall and his classmates would devise questions and problems that they were convinced Stickney could not solve, yet she reportedly never failed to solve them.

==Marriage and astronomy==
Stickney and Hall married in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, on March 31, 1856. As was common at the time, Stickney ended her formal academic career after she married. Immediately after the wedding, the couple moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, so that Hall could continue his education at the University of Michigan. Three months later, they moved to Shalersville, Ohio. It was Stickney who communicated with her husband&#x27;s employer, Captain Gillis, and successfully suggested that he should be made a professor at the Naval Observatory.
Stickney encouraged Hall to continue his search for satellites of Mars when he was ready to give up, and he successfully discovered the moons Phobos and Deimos. However, when she asked for payment equal to a man&#x27;s salary for her calculations, her husband refused, and Angeline then discontinued her work.

==Personal life==

Stickney Hall home-schooled all four of her children, all of whom later attended Harvard University. Her third son, Angelo Hall, a Unitarian minister, published a biography of Hall in 1908, titled &quot;An Astronomer&#x27;s Wife&quot;. Her oldest son, Asaph Hall, Jr., was born on October 6, 1859, and served as director of the Detroit Observatory from 1892 to 1905. Her other sons were named Samuel (second son) and Percival (fourth son); Percival Hall (1872–1953) was the second president of Gallaudet University from 1910 to 1946 (he himself was not deaf).

She died at North Andover, Massachusetts, at age 61. The largest crater on Phobos, Stickney Crater, is named after her.

<text>Capitol Hill in Salt Lake City gets its name from the Utah State Capitol prominently overlooking downtown, it is a neighborhood in Salt Lake City.

==Geography==
The hill slopes down to the south, overlooking downtown Salt Lake City, which is why the Utah State Capitol was built there between 1912 and 1916. State Street (U.S. Route 89 in Utah) leads up Capitol Hill, and Main Street also climbs the one block to the west. The entire Salt Lake City metro area can be seen from Capitol Hill, as can the Great Salt Lake miles to the west.

The hill is home to many historic buildings. The west-sloping side of the hill is a diverse neighborhood called &quot;Marmalade Hill&quot;, since the streets are named after various fruits that are often used in making marmalade. The east slope descends sharply into City Creek Canyon. Over the small canyon is another Salt Lake City neighborhood called &quot;the Avenues&quot;. Above and to the north of the Capitol building is the Wasatch Springs area named after nearby natural hot springs. The sloping south face of Capitol Hill is sometimes called &quot;Heber&#x27;s Bench&quot; after Heber C. Kimball, former resident and Apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The Marmalade District&#x27;s borders are generally considered to be a small triangular area bounded by 300 North on the south, 500 North on the north, Center Street on the east, and Quince Street, the district&#x27;s &quot;Main Street&quot;, on the west.

The Capitol Hill Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demographics==
==Marmalade District==
The western slope of Capitol Hill is called the &quot;Marmalade District&quot; after marmalade fruit jam because of the streets named after fruit trees imported and planted there such as apricot, quince and almond. Most of the original streets of Salt Lake City are aligned to and named after cardinal directions, and exceptions to this rule are often named. The Avenues are one example. The irregular, narrow, and steep roads of the Marmalade District are another.

The district is often considered among the most architecturally diverse in Utah residential neighborhoods. Early examples of Utah vernacular architecture sit alongside diverse turn-of-the-century styles such as a Russian-influenced LDS meeting house, Gothic revival homes, Victorian mansions, and eclectic houses of various combinations of adobe, brick, and carpentry.

==Notable buildings and sites on Capitol Hill==
*Utah State Capitol
*Salt Lake City Council Hall - old Salt Lake City Hall relocated to the hill from the downtown area. 
*White Community Memorial Chapel - 1883 Latter-day Saint 18th ward Gothic revival chapel that was privately rebuilt across from Capitol building for non-denominational services.
*Pioneer Memorial Museum - flagship museum and headquarters of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, building façade is a replica of the former Salt Lake Theatre.
*Mormon Battalion Monument - monument to the members of the Mormon Battalion.
*Kimball-Whitney Cemetery - a small cemetery for the Kimball and Whitney families, which is the final resting place of Heber C. Kimball. 
*Dickson-Gardner-Wolf Home - large 1905 Classic revival mansion on East Capitol Street for US District Attorney William H. Dickson.

===In the Marmalade District===
*19th Ward Meetinghouse - Russian-influenced Latter-day Saint (LDS) chapel featuring &quot;onion dome&quot; steeple.
*19th Ward Relief Society Hall - the last remaining separate LDS Relief Society hall. The 19th Ward Chapel and Relief Society Hall are today the home of the Salt Lake Acting Company, or SLAC, one of two professional theatre companies in Utah.
*John Platts Home - a very early 1856 vernacular adobe house with an 1860 fired brick second story added when bricks first became available in Utah. (NRHP-listed)
*Morrow-Taylor Home – c. 1868 Victorian Italiante home once allegedly the residence of LDS church president John Taylor while evading federal authorities.
*Richard Vaughen Morris Home - 1860s adobe house of Nauvoo Legionnaire Richard Vaughen Morris. (NRHP-listed)
*Thomas Quayle Home - 1884 gothic mansion relocated in 1975 from downtown.

===Also of note===
* Memory Grove – A park dedicated in 1920 to the victims of World War I. Memory Grove is in a small canyon immediately east of Capitol Hill.

==Culture==
===Events===
From June to August each year, the Capitol Preservation Board presents &quot;Movie Under the Stars.&quot; This is an outdoor movie series that shows different types of movies. In previous years movies such as Kung Fu Panda; My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding; Shrek the Third; Ant Bully; Iron Man; and Bedtime Stories have been shown. The movies are projected on an inflated movie screen on the south lawn of Capitol Building.

<doc id="781068" wikidata="Q1996624" url="?curid=781068" title="Road Rules">
<text>Road Rules is an MTV reality show that was a sister show of the network&#x27;s flagship reality show, &quot;The Real World&quot;. The series ran for 14 seasons, from July 19, 1995 to May 9, 2007. 

The series followed five to six strangers between the ages of 18 and 24, stripped of their money and restricted to a life in an RV, traveling from location to location. The strangers were guided by a set of clues and missions to complete at each location. It was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2001.

The series was a pioneer in travel/adventure/reward reality television (together with Mark Burnett&#x27;s &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot; productions). &quot;Road Rules&quot; was created by Jonathan Murray and Mary-Ellis Bunim of Bunim/Murray Productions. After Bunim died of cancer in early 2004, the show went into hiatus for three years.

The idea of &quot;Road Rules&quot; came to mind when &quot;Real World&quot; castmates Jon Brennan, Tami Akbar and Dominic Griffin traveled in an RV across the United States to get to their &quot;The Real World: Los Angeles&quot; house in the first two episodes of the second season. Bunim-Murray began working on the show soon after the third season of &quot;Real World&quot;, and finally debuted in 1995.

The show generated a spin-off series, also broadcast by MTV, known as &quot;The Challenge&quot; (originally known as &quot;Road Rules: All Stars&quot; before being renamed &quot;Real World/Road Rules Challenge&quot; after both its precursors), which is still in production. The spin-off series is mostly cast-contestant dependent on both &quot;Road Rules&quot; and &quot;The Real World&quot; as it combines contestants from various seasons of both precursors. &quot;The Challenge&quot; has run so far for 40 seasons since 1998, thus surpassing both &quot;Road Rules&quot; and &quot;The Real World&quot;.

In 2021, it was confirmed that a revamped version of &quot;Road Rules&quot; would air on Paramount+. However, this never materialized.

The series began with a simple format, closely mirroring its parent show &quot;The Real World&quot;. The concept was simple, abandon five strangers on the road, take away their money, have them drive around in an RV completing missions and doing odd jobs for money, and if they lasted to the end of the trip, they would win a &quot;handsome reward&quot;. It was touted as &quot;The Real World&quot; on an RV, but as the show progressed, several changes were made to the show for various reasons, mostly having to do with causing excitement and raising sagging ratings.

===Europe (Season 3)===
In its third season, producers of the show took production to the next level by deciding to move the show from the United States to Europe. While the first two seasons were not themed according to the series&#x27; location, the third season introduced the subtitle into the concept which would usually strand the Roadies in different locations around the world.

===Islands (Season 4)===
For the first time, the RV was completely abandoned for a short time in favor of an alternate mode of transportation. The cast traveled in and around the Caribbean islands and for a short time traveled on a catamaran. This season also competed against the Boston season of &quot;The Real World&quot; in San Juan, Puerto Rico, planting the seeds for the &quot;Real World/Road Rules Challenge&quot; and future face-offs.

===Northern Trail (Season 5)===
Changing the dynamic of the cast in hopes of creating more drama by including more people in the RV, an additional cast member was included, changing the number of cast members from five to six.

===Semester at Sea (Season 8)===
Enticed by the idea of sailing around the world, producers put the cast on the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Semester at Sea educational program. For the first time in any season, in order for the cast to get their handsome reward, the cast needed to complete coursework aboard the ship. Prior to this, cast members only needed to get to the end of the trip, and would not be penalized for refusing to do a mission.

===Maximum Velocity Tour (Season 9)===
Due to an exaggerated trend of sagging ratings, some say due to the Semester at Sea season, the show underwent a major re-tooling. The Maximum Velocity Tour represents when the series transitioned from a documentary-style reality show to an entertainment reality show. The show was brought back to the US and given a &quot;game show&quot; format. At the helm of a trip was a fictional character named the &quot;Road Master&quot; completed. After the cast would complete a mission, they would have points added to the group pool for the end prize and if they failed to complete a mission, they would lose the money.

===The Quest (Season 10)===
Producers continued to re-tool the show. This time, if the cast members lost two missions, they would have to vote out a cast member. Any additional mission lost after that, another cast member would be voted off. Also, instead of adding money to a group pool, the cast competed each mission for a &quot;key&quot; to the handsome reward. The &quot;keys&quot; were placed in the RV on a large board where each &quot;key&quot; represented a virtue the cast learned in that mission. For this season, the &quot;key&quot; would be represented as part of a crest. If the cast lost a mission, they would not receive the &quot;key&quot; until they voted off a cast member. Jisela Delgado was the first cast member to be voted off in the series. Katie Doyle was the first replacement in the series. The series remained largely unchanged after this season, although each subsequent series had its own variation on the rules of the game.

===Viewers&#x27; Revenge (Season 14)===
After the series&#x27; 13th season, MTV decided not to renew the series, giving the official status of &quot;on hiatus&quot; for four years before being officially cancelled. In March 2005, Bunim-Murray Productions pitched the idea of an interactive format to the show in which viewers at home would be a part of the series, and running the series in real time in order for the viewers at home to have a say in the competition; nothing came of this concept.

== &quot;Road Rules&quot; face-offs ==
Setting up the idea for &quot;The Real World/Road Rules Challenge&quot;, the face-offs have come to be an instrumental part of each season. The current cast competes either with a current &quot;The Real World&quot; cast who would be filming their series parallel to theirs or a former Road Rules cast, if Real World was ever out of its production season. The first official face-off, between the Islands and Boston casts gained such high ratings, that a spin-off series was begun, the ever-popular Challenges, and a pattern in most seasons where the cast would compete against another cast for a separate prize.

*First Adventure - No face-off during this season. Although cast member Mark initially appeared on the &quot;Real World: San Francisco&quot; season as one of three possible replacements for ousted housemate, Puck. The housemates chose Jo over Mark.
*Second Adventure vs. &quot;Real World: Miami&quot; - The Road Rules cast posed as house cleaners and stole the Miami&#x27;s cast eight-ball. They did so successfully. Timmy fooled Miami&#x27;s Dan and Cynthia who were obviously suspicious of the unannounced cleaning crew.
*Europe - No face-off.
*Islands vs. &quot;Real World: Boston&quot; - The casts competed in a series of competitions in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Prior to each event, two random people from the Boston cast were required to sit out in order for the number of people on each team to be even. The first event was to get each teammate through a web of wires. Each teammate had to pass through a different hole and could not touch the sides. The second event was to get each teammate from one platform to another using only a piece of wood that was not long enough to bridge the gap. The third event was to have all 5 teammates balance on a wooden cube at the same time. The fourth event was to have each teammate climb a wooden wall, and the final event was a tug of war. The Real World Boston won the first three events, and the Road Rules Islands cast won the final two. Syrus, while competing in the second mission, injured his shin attempting to jump from one platform to the other without using the board. The Islands crew, who desperately needed money at that time asked the Boston cast to split their winnings. The Boston cast declined to do so. They also played paintball with a team of former Road Rulers from different seasons at the beginning of their season. (Los/Christian/Devin/Effie/Michelle with special guest Timmy as a referee) The previous Road Rulers won two of the three contests, leaving the Road Rules Islands cast with only $400.
*Northern Trail vs. &quot;Road Rules: All Stars&quot; - The casts competed in a series of Olympic-themed games including luge, ski jumping, and figure skating. The Olympic-theme was due in part to the fact that the casts were competing in the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid, New York. The competition consisted of 5 events: a two-man kayak, a one-man kayak, two individual luges, ski jumping, and figure skating. Each person had to compete in at least one event but could not compete in more than two. Road Rules won the two man kayak and the luge while the Real World All-Stars won the individual kayak and the ski jumping events. At the figure skating competition, Noah and Dan edged out Sean and Cynthia to give Northern Trail the victory. The Northern Trail handed the keys off to their RV, which the All-Stars cast used for their season.
*Down Under vs. &quot;Real World: Seattle&quot; - The cast competed in the &quot;Aqua Games&quot; in Seattle&#x27;s main harbor. They competed in various games, including holding onto the back of a raft attached to a seadoo, jumping into rings from a platform, and the finale: a bull-riding contest. Nathan won the competition for the Seattle cast, while Christina and Susie both took the competition as a joke.
*Latin America vs. &quot;Road Rules: Down Under&quot; - The cast competed in Veracruz, Mexico in a series of games. The Down Under cast took the prize, but the more serious implication of this face-off was when Abe of the Latin America cast hooked up with Susie in the RV. This started the tension between Abe and Gladys, which led to Gladys hitting Abe and being sent home.
*Semester at Sea - Did not do a face-off. Various students on the Semester at Sea program participated in various missions during this season.
*Maximum Velocity Tour vs. &quot;Real World: New Orleans&quot; - In a throwback to the first face-off, the Maximum Velocity Tour cast worked with a Make-A-Wish child to pull off a sting on the Real World: New Orleans cast. They included the Make-A-Wish child in the mission, as the cast posed as Make-A-Wish ambassadors to distract the cast members while James and Laterrian jumped a back wall to steal the New Orleans&#x27; cast robotic dog. Hearing that the cast was in town, Melissa of the New Orleans cast hid the eight-ball in anticipation of the cast stealing it. This cast also competed in Los Angeles, CA against the cast of the first season of Making the Band (O-Town) in which O-Town won. They also competed against a group of winners from an MTV.com contest in Provo, Utah, which Road Rules won, and competed against the Playboy Extreme Team.
*The Quest vs. &quot;Real World: Back to New York&quot; - The casts met up in Morocco. These two casts met up after spending a week in Palm Spring during casting. Members of each cast had already made friends and enemies, creating instant drama and the casts playing practical jokes on each other. In direct contrast to her competitive persona on the Challenges, Back to New York&#x27;s Coral and fellow cast member Nicole refused to compete in a mud wrestling challenge. This left Back to New York&#x27;s Lori and Rachel to compete alone against the Road Rules girls. In a grueling mud wrestling competition, Road Rules won because Coral and Nicole refused to compete.
*Campus Crawl vs. &quot;Real World: Las Vegas&quot; - The Campus Crawl cast first had to take a photograph with one of the Las Vegas cast members handcuffed to the bathtub. Because Raquel had met Steven of Las Vegas in the College Station casting call, Raquel was able to coax Steven to show her and Rachel the Las Vegas suite. Not knowing that the two were from Road Rules, they were able to handcuff and photograph Steven. The cast competed at Lake Red Rock near Las Vegas, Nevada which The Real World won.
*South Pacific vs. &quot;Road Rules Campus Crawl&quot; - This cast competed in a marathon challenge, in which the cast was required to compete in different games but were not allowed to sleep during the 48-hour period. In the last competition, in which they had to remember various details in the past 48 hours, the Campus Crawl cast pulled off a win.
*X-Treme vs. &quot;Road Rules: South Pacific&quot; - The two casts competed in a series of games which concludes with a boxing match. The X-Treme cast beat the South Pacific cast.
*Viewers&#x27; Revenge vs. &quot;Pit Crew&quot;. Roadies beat out the Pit Crew in a mission that had players carrying tires from sand dunes. They also beat the Pit Crew in a mission that involved weight lifting and weight puzzles, along with a football game. The final challenge was carrying boxes across semis and dropping them into the hole; Pit Crew finally won, making the score 3-1.

<doc id="781090" wikidata="Q352918" url="?curid=781090" title="Emilio Mola">
<text>Emilio Mola y Vidal (9 July 1887 – 3 June 1937) was a Spanish military officer who was one of the three leaders of the Nationalist coup of July 1936 that started the Spanish Civil War.

After the death of Jose Sanjurjo on 20 July 1936, Mola commanded the Nationalists in the north of Spain, while Franco operated in the south. Attempting to take Madrid with his four columns, Mola praised local Nationalist sympathizers within the city as a &quot;fifth column&quot;, possibly the first use of that phrase. He died in a plane crash in bad weather, leaving Franco as the pre-eminent Nationalist leader for the rest of the war. It was suspected that his death was a result of sabotage. However, this has never been proven.

==Early life and career==
Mola was born in Placetas, Cuba, at that time an overseas Spanish province, where his father, an army officer, was stationed. The Cuban War of Independence split his family; while his father served in the Spanish forces, his maternal uncle Leoncio Vidal was a leading revolutionary fighter. In Spain, he enrolled in the Infantry Academy of Toledo in 1907. He served in Spain&#x27;s colonial war in Morocco where he received the Military Medal, and became an authority on military affairs. He was wounded in action during the Kert campaign in May 1912 in the thigh and thus he was promoted to Captain. By 1927 he was a Brigadier-general.

Mola was made Director-General of Security in 1930, the last man to hold this post under Alfonso XIII. This was a political post and his conservative views made him unpopular with opposition liberal and socialist politicians. When the left-wing Popular Front government was elected in February 1936 Mola was made commander of the Pamplona garrison, since the government regarded Navarre as a backwater region. In reality, the area was a center of Carlist activity, and Mola himself secretly collaborated with the movement. He worked with elements of the right-wing Spanish Military Union and by the end of April 1936 was acknowledged as its leader in north-central Spain.

==July Rebellion and Civil War==
Mola emerged as the chief planner among the plotters. While General José Sanjurjo, in exile in Portugal, remained the recognized leader, Mola was delegated the authority within the organization to plan operations in Spain. Known as &quot;the Director&quot;, Mola sent secret instructions to the various military units to be involved in the uprising and worked out a detailed plan for a post-coup government. In a memorandum dated 5 June 1936, Mola envisioned a &quot;republican dictatorship&quot; based on the Portuguese model. The initial government would consist of a &quot;directory&quot; that would oversee a semi-pluralist but authoritarian state. According to Mola: &quot;The Directory will guarantee no change in the republican regime during its administration, with no change in any worker claims that have been legally obtained&quot; but would &quot;create a strong and disciplined state&quot;. The 1931 constitution would be suspended and new elections would be held. Certain liberal elements, such as separation of church and state and freedom of worship, were to be maintained. Agrarian issues were to be resolved by regional commissions with the aim of developing small holdings, but allowing for collective cultivation in some circumstances.

Despite extensive planning, Mola apparently doubted the chances for the coup&#x27;s success. His dim view of the capabilities of monarchist militias and the conservative Catholic party Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), as well as only limited support from the Falange, led him as late as 9 July to consider the possibility of having to flee to France if it failed.

After several delays, 18 July 1936 was chosen as the date of the coup. Francisco Franco&#x27;s participation was not confirmed until early July. Although events ran ahead of schedule in the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco, Mola waited until 19 July to proclaim the revolt. When Mola&#x27;s brother was captured by the Republicans in Barcelona, the government threatened his life. Mola replied: &quot;No, he knows how to die as an officer. I can neither take back my word to my followers and probably you cannot either from yours.&quot; The brother ended up committing suicide. Mola then ordered systematic executions in captured cities to instill fear. He famously declared:

The Nationalist coup failed to gain control of Madrid or other urban areas, albeit most of the armed forces had supported it. As the situation devolved into civil war, Sanjurjo was killed in an air crash on 20 July. Mola then became Nationalist commander in the north, while Franco became commander in the south. With the death of Sanjurjo, Mola established a multi-member governing body for the so-called &quot;Nationalist zone&quot; (&quot;zona nacional&quot;) called the National Defense Junta. Based in Burgos, it was nominally headed by Miguel Cabanellas, the most senior participating general.

On 5 September a Nationalist offensive sent by General Mola under Colonel Alfonso Beorlegui took Irún and closed the French border. Mola&#x27;s forces went on to secure the whole of the province of Guipúzcoa, isolating the remaining Republican provinces in the north.

A junta in Burgos proved unable to set overall strategy; thus, Franco was chosen commander-in-chief at a meeting of ranking generals on 21 September. Mola continued to command the Army of the North and led an unsuccessful effort to take Madrid in October. In a radio address, he described Nationalist sympathizers in the city as a &quot;fifth column&quot; that supplemented his four military columns. The Republican government then proceeded to carry out the mass execution of as many as 2,000 suspected civilian and military supporters of the Nationalists. What was later known as the Paracuellos massacres crushed any potential fifth column.

==Death==
Mola died on 3 June 1937, when the Airspeed Envoy twin-engined aircraft in which he was travelling flew into the side of a mountain in bad weather while returning to Vitoria. The death of Mola, and the prior deaths of Sanjurjo and Goded left Franco as the pre-eminent leader of the Nationalist cause. In the assessment of historian Stanley Payne, Mola had been &quot;the only subordinate capable of talking back to Franco.&quot; Although there have always been accusations that Franco arranged the deaths of his two rivals, so far no evidence has been produced.

In 1947, Franco, as Caudillo of the recently re-established Kingdom of Spain, posthumously granted Mola the title of Duke of Mola and Grandee of Spain. The title was immediately assumed by his son, Don Emilio Mola y Bascón. It was abolished in October 2022, under the purview of the Democratic Memory Law.

<text>William Jones (1839 – 15 April 1913) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross for his action at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in January 1879, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

Jones&#x27;s attestation papers list him as being born at Evesham, Worcestershire. He may have been of the family of shoemakers by the name of Jones that lived in Cowl Street, Evesham, in the mid-1840s, but he was actually born on 16 August 1839 at 5 Lucas Street, Castle Precincts, Bristol. He was approximately 39 years old and a private in the British Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), during the Zulu War, when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in action.
On 23 January 1879 at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa, Private 593 William Jones and Private 716 Robert Jones defended one of the wards in the field hospital, as described in their joint VC citation:
==Later life==
Jones was being treated at Netley Hospital for chronic rheumatism, which he claimed to have contracted from the cold and wet nights after Rorke&#x27;s Drift; before being discharged on 2 January 1880 and on 13 January 1880, he received his award from Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. Upon leaving the Army, he attempted to establish himself in Birmingham. Employment opportunities were few, but he managed to take part in a number of acting parts, including Hamilton&#x27;s Pansterorama and in 1887 he eventually became a member of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show.

Later, Jones moved to Rutland Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester and in 1910 pawned his Victoria Cross, having fallen upon hard times. He was admitted to work in the workhouse on Bridge Street, Manchester. William was one of the few survivors of the battle to live into his 70s. He died on 15 April 1913 and was buried in a paupers grave in Philips Park Cemetery, Manchester (plot D-887 in the Church of England section). A large blue commemoration plaque adorned the wall of the disused church, alongside another plaque to commemorate World War I Victoria Cross recipient, George Stringer. New plaques have since been created near the war memorial.

After four years of campaigning, on 2 November 2007 a ceremony was held at Philip&#x27;s Park Cemetery to celebrate the unveiling of a new headstone for the grave.
In the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, Jones was portrayed by the actor Richard Davies.

==The medal==
Jones had to pawn his VC sometime in the 1890s, having fallen on hard times. It was eventually brought to where it is now displayed, at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, Brecon, Powys, Wales.

==Bearing the Cross==
&quot;Bearing the Cross&quot; was a Ken Blakeson play which looked into the lives of three soldiers who fought at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. It was broadcast in 2008 and 2009 on BBC Radio 4 with Nigel Anthony as William Jones VC, Sebastian Harcombe as Robert Jones VC and Jon Strickland as Henry Hook VC. The play starts in 1887 at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show in London, where the battle against the Zulus was restaged with Private William Jones VC as presenter.

<text>The Battle of Tanga, also known as the Battle of the Bees, was an unsuccessful invasion of the Port of Tanga in German East Africa by the British Indian Expeditionary Force &quot;B&quot; on 3–5 November 1914 during World War I. Under the command of the Major-General Arthur Aitken, British forces attacked Tanga in concert with Indian Expeditionary Force &quot;C&quot;, which concomitantly attempted to capture Longido. The battle was the first major engagement of the East African campaign and saw Aitken&#x27;s troops defeated by a smaller force of German Schutztruppen under Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and forced to retreat. Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s men captured weapons, medical supplies, tents, blankets, rations and several Maxim guns after the battle, which played a major role in allowing his troops to resist the Allies for the rest of the world conflict.

==Background==
Tanga, situated only from the border of British East Africa (modern-day Kenya), was a busy port and the ocean terminal of the important Usambara Railway, which ran from Tanga to Neu Moshi at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro. Tanga was initially to be bombarded by Royal Navy warships, but this part of the plan was scrapped. An agreement was in place guaranteeing the neutrality of the capital Dar es Salaam and Tanga, but now the accord was modified and it seemed &quot;only fair to warn the Germans that the deal was off.&quot;

Instead, the British resolve to capture German East Africa was to be implemented with an amphibious attack on Tanga. Unlike the plan on paper, however, the attack turned into a debacle. On 2 November 1914, the British protected cruiser arrived. The ship&#x27;s commander, Captain Francis Wade Caulfeild, went ashore giving Tanga one hour to surrender and take down the flag of the German Empire. Before departing, he demanded to know if the harbour was mined; it was not, but he was assured that it was. After three hours, the flag was still flying and &quot;Fox&quot; departed to bring in the Force &quot;B&quot; convoy of fourteen troop transports. This gave time for both the Schutztruppen and the citizens of Tanga to prepare for an attack. The German commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, rushed to Tanga. He reinforced the defences (initially only a single company of Askaris) with troops brought in by railway from Neu Moshi, eventually numbering about 1,000 in six companies. His second-in-command was former German East Africa Company Captain Tom von Prince.

==Battle==

Captain Caulfeild ordered the harbour swept for mines during 2 November and well into the next day. During the sweeping, the Force &quot;B&quot; commander, Aitken, began the unopposed landing of troops and supplies in two groups at the harbour and three miles east of the city on a mine-free beach. By evening on 3 November, the invasion force was ashore with the exception of the 27th Mountain Battery and the Faridkot Sappers. At noon on 4 November, Aitken ordered his troops to march on the city. Well concealed defenders quickly broke up their advance. The fighting then turned to skirmishing amidst the coconut and palm oil plantations by the southern contingent and bitter street-fighting by the harbour force. 

The Kashmir Rifles and the 2nd Loyal North Lancashire Regiment of the harbour contingent made good progress; they entered the town, captured the customs house and Hotel Deutscher Kaiser and ran up the Union Jack. But then the advance was stopped. Less-well trained and equipped Indian battalions of Richard Wapshare&#x27;s 27th (Bangalore) Brigade scattered and ran away from the battle. The 98th Infantry were attacked by swarms of angry bees and broke up. The bees attacked the Germans as well, hence the battle&#x27;s nickname. British propaganda transformed the bee interlude into a fiendish German plot, conjuring up hidden trip wires to agitate the hives. The 13th Rajputs failed to play a significant role in the battle as their morale had been shaken when witnessing the retreat of the 63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry.

The colonial volunteers of the 7th and 8th &quot;Schützenkompanien&quot; (rifle companies) arrived by railway to stiffen the pressed Askari lines. The normally mounted 8th &quot;Schützenkompanie&quot; had left their horses at Neu Moshi. By late afternoon on 4 November, Lettow-Vorbeck ordered his last reserves, the 13th and 4th Askari &quot;Feldkompanien&quot; (field companies) – the 4th had just reached Tanga by train), to envelop the British flank and rear by launching bayonet attacks along the entire front to &quot;bugle calls and piercing tribal war cries.&quot; At least three battalions of the Imperial Service Brigade would have been wiped out to a man, if they had not taken to their heels. All semblance of order vanished as Force B&#x27;s retirement &quot;degenerated into total rout.&quot;

Still outnumbered eight to one, caution overtook some of the German officers. Through a series of errors by the buglers and misunderstandings by an officer to disengage and consolidate, the Askari withdrew to a camp several miles west of Tanga. As soon as Lettow-Vorbeck learned of this, he countermanded the move and ordered a redeployment that was not completed until early morning. &quot;For nearly all of the night [before sunrise 5 November], Tanga was Aitken&#x27;s for the taking. It was the most stupendous irony of the battle.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Furious and frustrated, Aitken ordered a general withdrawal. In their retreat and evacuation back to the transports that lasted well into the night, the attacking troops left behind nearly all their equipment. &quot;Lettow-Vorbeck was able to re-arm three Askari companies with modern rifles, for which he now had 600,000 rounds of ammunition. He also had sixteen more machine guns, valuable field telephones&quot; and enough clothing to last the Schutztruppe for a year. On the morning of 5 November, Force B&#x27;s intelligence officer—Captain Richard Meinertzhagen—entered Tanga under a white flag, bringing medical supplies and carrying a letter from General Aitken apologizing for shelling the hospital. The streets of Tanga were strewn with dead and wounded. German doctors and their African orderlies worked tirelessly and &quot;with a fine disregard for their patients&#x27; uniforms.&quot;

The successful defence of Tanga was the first of many achievements of Lettow-Vorbeck during his long campaign in East Africa. For the British, however, the battle was nothing short of a disaster, and was recorded in the British &quot;Official History of the War&quot; as &quot;one of the most notable failures in British military history.&quot; Casualties included 360 killed and 487 wounded on the British side; the Schutztruppe lost 16 Germans and 55 Askaris killed, and 76 total wounded.

Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck initially estimated the number of British killed at 800 but later said that he believed the number was more likely over 2,000. The Germans subsequently released the British officers who had been wounded or captured after they gave their word not to fight again during the war.

<doc id="781135" wikidata="Q575675" url="?curid=781135" title="Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics was held at Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, Greece with ranking rounds on 12 August and regular competition held from 15 August to 21 August. One hundred twenty-eight archers from forty-three nations competed in the four gold medal events—individual and team events for men and for women—that were contested at these games.

The stadium, often called Kallimarmaro, is notable as the site of the first Olympic Games and even earlier, where the Ancient Greeks&#x27; Panathenean Games were hosted. At the behest of James Easton, president of the International Archery Federation, archery events were held in the historic stadium, hoping that its history and natural beauty would attract the public to the sport. Laurence Godfrey, the fourth-place finisher in the men&#x27;s individual event, remarked that the stadium inspired pride, while American Vic Wunderle spoke for most of the archers in saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a great honor and a privilege to be able to compete inside the 1896 Olympic Stadium.&quot;

The Korean team won three out of the four gold medals contested. Four Olympic records and several other world records were broken at these games, despite poor weather conditions during the preliminary rounds of competition.

==Qualification and format==

There were four ways for National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to qualify individual archers for the Olympics in archery. For each gender, the host nation (Greece) was guaranteed three spots. The 2003 World Target Competition&#x27;s top 8 teams (not including the host nation) each received three spots, and the 19 highest ranked archers after the team qualifiers were removed also received spots. Fifteen of the remaining eighteen spots were divided equally among the five Olympic continents for allocation in continental tournaments. The last three spots in each gender were determined by the Tripartite Commission. Sixty-four archers of each sex took part in the Olympics, with each NOC being able to enter a maximum of three archers.

For all archery events at the Olympics, archers stand 70 metres from their target. The target consists of concentric circles, and has a total diameter of 122 cm. Archers earn points based on which circle their arrow landed in, with ten points awarded for hitting the center circle, and one point awarded for hitting the outermost circle. During the ranking rounds, each archer shot twelve ends, or groups, of six arrows per end. The score from that round determined the match-ups in the elimination rounds, with high-ranking archers facing low-ranking archers. The first three rounds of elimination used six ends of three arrows, narrowing the field of archers from 64 to 8. The three final rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) each used four ends of three arrows.

Thirteen men&#x27;s and fifteen women&#x27;s teams competed in the team competitions. The teams consisted of the country&#x27;s three archers from the individual round, and the team&#x27;s initial ranking was determined by summing the three members&#x27; scores in the individual ranking round. Each round of eliminations consisted of each team shooting 27 arrows (9 by each archer).

==Medal summary==
==Event summary==
For the sixth Olympics in a row, the South Korean team came out as the clear victor, taking three out of the four gold medals in Athens. Korean archers set new world records in the women&#x27;s individual (Park Sung-hyun) and team (Park, Yun Mi-Jin, and Lee Sung-Jin) ranking rounds and the men&#x27;s individual ranking round (Im Dong Hyun), though none of those scores counted as Olympic records because the ranking round was held before the opening ceremony. Olympic records were broken in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s 36-arrow 1/16 and 1/8 rounds combined (by Chen Szu Yuan of Chinese Taipei and Yun of Korea), as well as in the men&#x27;s 18-arrow match (by Park Kyung Mo of Korea) and 36-arrow finals rounds combined (by Tim Cuddihy of Australia).
In the men&#x27;s events, the Korean team shot 12 maximum scores of 10 to win the gold medal against Chinese Taipei 251–245. Losing by two points, the United States failed to fend off the Ukraine team to capture the bronze. The event causing the most upset however was the men&#x27;s individual, the only event that the Korean team has never won and yet again failed to clinch. Defending champion Simon Fairweather was ousted from the competition in a first round loss due to blustery weather conditions. The wind caused some archers like Fairweather to make one-point shots, and its strength even caused others to miss their targets completely. The final matches of this event also saw competitors coming close in score, with Italian Marco Galiazzo beating the Japanese Hiroshi Yamamoto by only two points to win gold. Even closer still was the bronze medal match, in which Britain&#x27;s Laurence Godfrey was outshot 112–113 by seventeen-year-old Australian Tim Cuddihy, who himself only managed to get into the semifinals by one point.

The woman&#x27;s individual event fell easily to the Koreans; they have won this event continuously since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and swept all three medals at the 2000 Olympics. Though both gold and silver fell to Korean archers, Alison Williamson captured the bronze medal, giving Britain its first medal in archery since 1992. In the team event, the Korean women beat the Chinese team 241–240 to win the gold medal, making this their eleventh straight women&#x27;s team championship win. Chinese Taipei easily took the bronze medal over France.

== Participating nations ==
Forty-three nations contributed archers to compete in the events. Below is a list of the competing nations; in parentheses are the number of national competitors.

<text>Havildar Bhanbhagta Gurung, VC (; September 1921 – 1 March 2008), also known as Bhanbhakta Gurung, was a Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, awarded for his actions while serving as a Rifleman with the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles in Burma during the Second World War.

==Early life and service==
Bhanbhagta Gurung was born in Phalpu, a small hill village in western Nepal in the district of Gorkha in September 1921. He enlisted in the British Indian Army during World War II, joining 3rd Battalion of the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles), which recruited from the Gurung people, at the age of eighteen.

Promoted to lance naik (equivalent to lance corporal), he served in the first Chindit expedition (Operation Longcloth) led by Brigadier Orde Wingate into northern Burma in March 1943. He was serving in Number 4 Column, deep behind Japanese lines across the Chindwin River, when the column was ambushed by the Japanese 33rd Division and ordered to disperse. His battalion was withdrawn from the line after the expedition for several months of training and refitting, and redeployed in March 1944 in Arakan in the 25th Indian Infantry Division, fighting down the Mayu Range towards Akyab. Bhanbhagta was promoted to Naik (corporal).

Shortly before the action that won him the VC, he had been reduced to the ranks for neglect of duty after being blamed for taking the wrong hill, to the ire of the battalion commander (although it later transpired that he had followed the orders of his platoon commander, who had given him the wrong target).

In February 1945, the 25th Indian Division landed at Ru-ywa, as a diversion from the offensive by General Sir William Slim&#x27;s Fourteenth Army towards Mandalay, and advanced to the Irrawaddy River through the An pass, held by the Japanese 54th Division from a number of hills. The Gurkhas held two hills, code-named &quot;Snowdon&quot; and &quot;Snowdon East&quot;, but were attacked by the Japanese and pushed back. They were ordered to retake the hills.

==Details==
Bhanbhagta Gurung was about 24 years old, and a Rifleman in the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

:On 5 March 1945 at Snowdon-East, near Tamandu, Burma (now Myanmar), Gurung and his unit were approaching Snowdon-East. His section became pinned down by enemy fire including machine guns and mortars. An enemy sniper in a tree was inflicting casualties on the section, &quot;Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung, being unable to fire from the lying position, stood up fully exposed to the heavy fire and calmly killed the enemy sniper with his rifle, thus saving his section from suffering further casualties&quot;.

:The section advanced to within 20 yards of the objective, and again it came under fire. Without waiting for orders, Gurung dashed out alone to attack the first enemy fox-hole. &quot;Throwing two grenades, he killed the two occupants and without any hesitation rushed on to the next enemy fox-hole and killed the Japanese in it with his bayonet&quot;. He cleared two further fox-holes with bayonet and grenades. &quot;During his single-handed attacks on these four enemy fox-holes, Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung was subjected to almost continuous and point-blank Light Machine Gun fire from a bunker on the North tip of the objective.&quot; Knowing that the bunker would hold up both his own platoon and another, &quot;for the fifth time [he] went forward alone in the face of heavy enemy fire to knock out this position. He doubled forward and leapt on to the roof of the bunker from where, his hand grenades being finished, he flung two No. 77 smoke grenades into the bunker slit.&quot; Gurung killed two Japanese soldiers who ran out of the bunker with his Kukri, and then crawled into the cramped bunker and killed the remaining Japanese soldier by &quot;beat[ing] the gunner&#x27;s brains out with a rock&quot;.

:Gurung ordered a Bren gunner and two riflemen to take up positions in the bunker. &quot;The enemy counter-attack followed soon after, but under Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung&#x27;s command the small party inside the bunker repelled it with heavy loss to the enemy. Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung showed outstanding bravery and a complete disregard for his own safety. His courageous clearing of five enemy positions single-handed was in itself decisive in capturing the objective and his inspiring example to the rest of the Company contributed to the speedy consolidation of this success.&quot;

His regiment gained the battle honour &quot;Tamandu&quot; as a result of the engagement and he received his Victoria Cross from King George VI at Buckingham Palace.

==Later life==
Soon after the war ended, Gurung&#x27;s company commander tried to persuade him to continue serving, but he declined as he had a frail widowed mother as well as a young wife and children to take care of in Nepal. When he quit the regiment in January 1946 he had regained his former rank of Naik and had been given the rank of Honorary Havildar. In addition to his VC he was also awarded the Star of Nepal, 3rd Class, in 1945. In 2000 the Gurkha training company block at Catterick Garrison in the UK was named after him.

His three sons also served in the 2nd Gurkhas. Bhanbhagta suffered from asthma for many years and for the last four years of his life was housebound at his youngest son&#x27;s house at Gorkha. His oldest son Krishna Bahadur Gurung&#x27;s youngest son is now a captain in the 1RGR army in Brunei with his wife and children.

He died on 1 March 2008, aged 86.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum at Winchester, Hampshire, in England.

<doc id="781177" wikidata="Q6227806" url="?curid=781177" title="John Cruickshank">
<text>John Alexander Cruickshank, (born 20 May 1920) is a Scottish former banker, former Royal Air Force officer, and a Second World War recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Cruickshank was awarded the VC for sinking a German U-boat and then, despite serious injuries, safely landing his aircraft. He is the last living recipient to have been awarded the VC during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Born on 20 May 1920 in Aberdeen, Scotland, Cruickshank was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Aberdeen Grammar School and Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College. He was apprenticed to the Commercial Bank in Edinburgh.

==Military service==
Within a year, on his father&#x27;s suggestion, Cruickshank joined the Territorial Army, enlisting in the Royal Artillery in May 1939; he served there until the summer of 1941 when he transferred to the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He underwent flight training in Canada and the United States, earning his wings in July 1942. On 10 July, by then a sergeant, he received an emergency commission as a pilot officer in the RAFVR. He was promoted flying officer (war-substantive) on 10 January 1943. After further training, he was assigned to No. 210 Squadron in March 1943, piloting Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, flying from RAF Sullom Voe in Shetland.

Sullom Voe, now known for its oil terminal, was a flying-boat base during the Second World War. It was used by 210 Squadron of RAF Coastal Command in its battle to keep the North Atlantic and Arctic sea lanes open for supply convoys. Flying Officer Cruickshank was twenty-four years old when he piloted a Consolidated Catalina anti-submarine flying boat from Sullom Voe on 17 July 1944 on a patrol north into the Norwegian Sea. The objective was to protect the British Home Fleet as it returned from the unsuccessful Operation Mascot raid on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. There the &quot;Cat&quot; caught a German Type VIIC U-boat on the surface.

At this point in the war U-boats had been fitted with anti-aircraft guns as an attempt to counter the aerial threat. Cruickshank attacked the U-boat, flying his Catalina through a hail of flak. His first pass was unsuccessful, as his depth charges did not release. He brought the aircraft around for a second pass, this time straddling the U-boat and sinking it. All 52 crew members were lost. The U-boat was thought to be &quot;U-347&quot;, as Cruickshank&#x27;s VC citation states, but the boat was actually &quot;U-361&quot;.

The German anti-aircraft fire had been deadly accurate, killing the navigator and injuring four others, including both Cruickshank and less seriously wounded second pilot Flight Sergeant Jack Garnett. Cruickshank was hit in seventy-two places, with two serious wounds to his lungs and ten penetrating wounds to his lower limbs. Despite this, he refused medical attention until he was sure that the appropriate radio signals had been sent and the aircraft was on course for its home base. Even then, he refused morphine, aware that it would cloud his judgement. Flying through the night, it took the damaged Catalina five and a half hours to return to Sullom Voe, with Garnett at the controls and Cruickshank lapsing in and out of consciousness in the back. Cruickshank then returned to the cockpit and took command of the aircraft again. Deciding that the light and the sea conditions for a water landing were too risky for the inexperienced Garnett to put the aircraft down safely, he kept the flying boat in the air circling for an extra hour until he considered it safer, when they landed the Catalina on the water and taxied to an area where it could be safely beached.

When the RAF medical officer boarded the aircraft, he discovered Cruickshank had lost a great deal of blood, and had to give him a transfusion before he was stable enough to be transferred to hospital. John Cruickshank&#x27;s injuries were such that he never flew in command of an aircraft again. For his actions in sinking the U-boat and saving his crew he received the Victoria Cross while Flight Sergeant Jack Garnett received the Distinguished Flying Medal. Later that month, Cruickshank was promoted flight lieutenant (war-substantive), with effect from 10 July.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, reading

==Later life==
Cruickshank left the RAF in September 1946 to return to his career in banking; he retired from this in 1977. In March 2004 the Queen unveiled the first national monument to Coastal Command at Westminster Abbey, London. Cruickshank said in an interview after the ceremony: &quot;When they told me that I was to get the VC it was unbelievable. Decorations didn&#x27;t enter my head.&quot; Four VCs were awarded to Coastal Command in the war; the others were posthumous.

He is vice chairman of The Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. He celebrated his 100th birthday on 20 May 2020. He became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross to reach the age of 100, and the second member of the VC and GC Association after Stuart Archer, a George Cross recipient.

In March 2024, Cruickshank was presented the Air Efficiency Award on a private visit by Group Captain (retd) Kemp of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Through research, it was proven that Cruickshank should have been granted the medal over 70 years prior.

<doc id="781180" wikidata="Q3328744" url="?curid=781180" title="Music for Chameleons">
<text>Music for Chameleons (1980) is a collection of short fiction and non-fiction by the American author Truman Capote. Capote&#x27;s first collection of new material in fourteen years, &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; spent sixteen weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, unprecedented for a collection of short works.

==Structure==
The book is divided into three sections. Part one, titled &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;, includes the short story after which the section and book are named, as well as five other stories (&quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, &quot;A Lamp in a Window&quot;, &quot;Mojave&quot;, &quot;Hospitality&quot; and &quot;Dazzle&quot;). Part two, the core of the book, consists of a single piece: &quot;Handcarved Coffins&quot;, ostensibly a &quot;nonfiction account of an American crime&quot; that suggests certain parallels with his best-known work, the difference being that Capote did not include himself as a character in the narrative when he wrote &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;.

In the third section, &quot;Conversational Portraits&quot;, Capote recalls his encounters with Pearl Bailey, Bobby Beausoleil, Willa Cather, Marilyn Monroe and others. These seven essays are titled &quot;A Day&#x27;s Work&quot;, &quot;Hello, Stranger&quot;, &quot;Hidden Gardens&quot;, &quot;Derring-Do&quot;, &quot;Then It All Came Down&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Child&quot; and &quot;Nocturnal Turnings.&quot; &quot;A Day&#x27;s Work&quot; was Capote&#x27;s account of a shift he spent with a New York day maid, an idea his friend Slim Keith recalled him having before he set out to work on &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;.

==Conception==
In the preface of the collection, Capote claims to have suffered a drug and alcohol-induced nervous breakdown in 1977, at which point he ceased working on his highly anticipated follow-up to &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;, portions of which had elicited a riotous reaction in the jet set when excerpted in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine throughout 1975 and 1976. This is most likely the truth, although Capote would often contradict that statement and claim that the publication of the novel was imminent until his death in 1984.

==Publication history==
In 2001, &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; was reprinted in a Penguin Modern Classics edition with a Jamie Keenan cover design and a cover photograph showing Capote dancing with Marilyn Monroe.

==Literary significance and reception==
Critics have debated the degree to which Capote&#x27;s nonfiction pieces contain elements of fiction if not downright fabrication, but critics&#x27; objections are often qualified by praise for the mood, atmosphere, and range of human emotions Capote captured when creating these character studies. For example, in his review of &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (August 5, 1980), Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote:
Much of the book was written during the author&#x27;s last burst of productivity in 1979. As Capote began to eschew partying and carousing in favor of maintaining a regimented writing schedule at his Turtle Bay residence, his newly disciplined elan gave brief hope to those who felt his addictions were beyond help. Ten of the 14 pieces had been commissioned for Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; and initially published in the then-regular &quot;Conversations with Capote&quot; feature. At that point, Warhol was one of Capote&#x27;s few remaining champions, and Capote&#x27;s need for support likely necessitated the completion of the work at a rapid clip. Warhol submitted reluctantly to Capote&#x27;s demand for full creative and editorial control, though editor Brigid Berlin proved adept at winning the author over when changes were absolutely necessary. After the collection&#x27;s publication, Capote all but terminated his relationship with &quot;Interview&quot;, and his health and self-restraint continued to deteriorate.

In a 1992 piece in the &quot;London Sunday Times&quot;, which had earlier serialized &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;, reporters Peter and Leni Gillman investigated the source of &quot;Handcarved Coffins&quot;, the piece Capote subtitled &quot;a nonfiction account of an American crime&quot;. They found no reported series of American murders in the same town which included all of the details Capote described—the sending of miniature coffins, a rattlesnake murder, a decapitation, etc. Instead, they found that a few of the details closely mirrored a case on which Al Dewey, the investigator Capote portrayed in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, had worked. They concluded that Capote had invented the rest of the story, including his meetings with the suspected killer, Quinn.

Capote previously furnished a full account of the Dewey case during a May 20, 1975 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;. While noting that he had no desire to write another true crime opus, he recalled that one particular case had caught his interest. Thereafter, Capote went on to describe the rattlesnake murders, the burning farm house murders, and other details. He also stated that he could not divulge all the details of the crime (including the locations involved) because the police did not have enough evidence to arrest their suspect, and that there were others on a &quot;list&quot; that the killer was still stalking. He stated that the police had the suspect under constant surveillance and were awaiting further action. This account seems to follow the portion of the finished story the Gillmans thought was patterned after a true crime but did not include portions that they felt had been fabricated.

<text>Ian Edward Fraser, (18 December 1920 – 1 September 2008) was an English diving pioneer, sailor and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Fraser was born in Ealing in Middlesex and went to school in High Wycombe. After initially working on merchant ships and serving in the Royal Naval Reserve, he joined the Royal Navy at the start of the Second World War. After being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions while serving on submarines, he was placed in command of a midget submarine during an attack in Singapore codenamed Operation Struggle. For his bravery in navigating the mined waters, and successfully placing mines on a Japanese cruiser, Fraser was awarded the Victoria Cross.

After retiring from the Royal Navy, Fraser set up a commercial diving organisation after realising the ease of use of new frogman-type diving equipment. After serving in several honorary positions on the Wirral, Fraser retired from the Royal Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander in 1965. He died on 1 September 2008, on the Wirral, Merseyside.

==Early life==
Fraser was born in Ealing in 1920. He was the elder son of Sydney Fraser, a marine engineer. He attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and the school ship . He worked on merchant ships from 1938 to 1939.

==Second World War==
Fraser joined the Royal Naval Reserve in 1939, initially with the rank of midshipman, serving on several destroyers. In 1943, he joined the submarine . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1943 for &quot;bravery and skill in successful submarine patrols.&quot; In 1944, at age 24, he became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, and volunteered to serve on the &#x27;X&#x27; craft midget submarine depot ship from 7 November 1944 to July 1945.

Ian Fraser was played by actor Martin Delaney in a TV show entitled, &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;. The show was narrated in part by Charles, Prince of Wales. It tells the story of Fraser&#x27;s attempt to sink the &quot;Takao&quot; on a secret mission aboard a midget submarine.

On 31 July 1945 in the Straits of Johor between Singapore and Malaya, Lieutenant Fraser, in command of an improved X-boat, HMS &quot;XE-3&quot;, attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Takao&quot;, after making a long and hazardous journey through mined waters. Fraser slid the submarine under the &quot;Takao&quot;, which lay over a depression in the sea bed, and his diver Acting Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis went out to fix the limpet mines to the bottom of the ship. The two side-charges then had to be released from &quot;XE-3&quot;, but the starboard charge stuck and Magennis climbed out again and after a nerve-wracking seven minutes released the charge. &quot;XE-3&quot; then made for home. Magennis was also awarded a Victoria Cross, and Fraser became a lieutenant commander.

The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 9 November 1945 (dated 13 November 1945) and read:

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Later life==
* 1946: Fraser was awarded the American decoration of Legion of Merit, Degree of Officer.
* 1947: Fraser left the Royal Navy, but he remained in the Royal Naval Reserve. He set up a commercial diving firm.
* 1953: He was promoted to lieutenant commander.
* 1957: Fraser&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Frogman VC&quot; was published.
* 1957: He became a Justice of the Peace in Wallasey.
* 16 August 1963: He was awarded a clasp to his Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve.
* 18 December 1965: He left the Royal Naval Reserve.
* 1980: He became a Younger Brother of Trinity House.
* 1993: He was made an honorary freeman of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.
* 1 September 2008: Fraser died aged 87 at Arrowe Park Hospital, after a three-week illness. He was survived by his wife Melba, and 5 of his 6 children, and 13 grandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren. He was cremated at Landican cemetery, Birkenhead.

===Scuba diving===
Realising that frogman-type diving (i.e. what is now called scuba diving) could do many sorts of underwater work unsuitable for the old-type heavy standard diving gear, he and some associates got hold of war-surplus frogman&#x27;s kit and set up a popular public show displaying frogman techniques in a big aquarium tank in Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester in England. One of his early calls to underwater work was from the police to recover the body of a little girl who had drowned in a pond in Denton, Greater Manchester.

Using the show&#x27;s takings, and with his younger brother Brian Fraser, he set up a commercial diving organisation called Universal Divers Ltd, of which he was managing director from 1947 to 1965 and, since 1983 (as former chairman).

In January 1961 Universal Divers Ltd was involved in underwater survey on damage caused to the Severn Railway Bridge by collision by two barges.

<text>Edward Kenna, VC (6 July 1919 – 8 July 2009) was an Australian soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Before his death, he was the last surviving Australian to have been awarded a Victoria Cross during the Second World War.

==Second World War==
Kenna served in the Citizen Military Forces from August 1940 and was allotted service number V55955. In December 1941, the Citizens Military Force was called up for full-time service for the duration of the war. In June 1942, Kenna volunteered for the Second Australian Imperial Force and was allotted new service number VX102142. He served in the 23rd/21st Battalion in Victoria and later in the Darwin area. In June 1943, his unit returned to Victoria before being sent to Queensland. At this point, the unit was disbanded and its members allotted as reinforcements to other units. Kenna was assigned to the 2/4th Battalion and embarked for New Guinea in October 1944.

===Victoria Cross action===
The citation for his VC was gazetted on 6 September 1945, and read:

Three weeks later he was shot in the mouth and spent more than a year in hospital before being discharged from the AIF in December 1946. The following year he married Marjorie Rushberry, a nurse who had cared for him at Heidelberg Military Hospital.

Interviewed about his VC action for the Australians at War Film Archive in 2002, Kenna said:
==Later life==
After his discharge from hospital, Kenna returned to Hamilton, Victoria. The people of the Hamilton district raised sufficient funds to build Kenna and his wife a house. The Kennas had four children. After the war he worked with the local council and played Australian rules football for the local team. He attended many Victoria Cross reunions in London and led the annual Anzac Day march in Melbourne. In the 1980s Kenna had his portrait painted by Sir William Dargie and in July 2000 he was featured on a postage stamp as part of an issue commemorating Australia&#x27;s living Victoria Cross winners.

Before his death in 2009, two days after his 90th birthday, Kenna was the last living Australian VC recipient of the Second World War, and one of only two Australian living recipients of the Victoria Cross; the other being Keith Payne, who was awarded his VC during the Vietnam War. (Mark Donaldson, who received a Victoria Cross for Australia, was also living.)

Kenna&#x27;s Victoria Cross was on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra for a period in 2010. His family later decided to sell his medals, including the VC, at an auction held at Dallas Brooks Hall in July 2011. Kenna&#x27;s medal group was sold for a record high A$1,002,000 to an unknown buyer.

In 2013, a bronze statue of Kenna by sculptor Peter Corlett was unveiled in his hometown of Hamilton, Victoria.

<doc id="781201" wikidata="Q1361789" url="?curid=781201" title="The Emperor and the Assassin">
<text>The Emperor and the Assassin (), also known as The First Emperor, is a 1998–1999 Chinese historical romance film based primarily on Jing Ke&#x27;s assassination attempt on the King of Qin, as described in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. The film was directed by Chen Kaige and stars Gong Li, Zhang Fengyi, Li Xuejian, and Zhou Xun. The film was well received critically and won the Technical Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. It was the most expensive Chinese film made up to that time, costing US$20 million.

==Plot==
The film covers much of Ying Zheng&#x27;s career, recalling his early experiences as a hostage and foreshadowing his dominance over China. He is essentially depicted as an idealist seeking to impose a peace or unity on the world. However, his experiencing of various betrayals and losses slowly turn him into a mad tyrant. The story consists of three main incidents: the attempt by Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng in 227 BCE; the (fictitious) rumour of a Chief Minister&#x27;s having sired the latter before transferring his concubine to become the Queen Dowager; and the story of an official having sired children by the Queen Dowager herself. The first incident is the climax of the film, with earlier scenes foreshadowing it; the other two incidents occur between the fictional genesis and historical manifestation of the first.

In the film, Ying Zheng sends his concubine Lady Zhao to the Yan state as a spy to enlist a Yan assassin to attempt to assassinate him, intending to use that as a &quot;casus belli&quot; to start a war against Yan. Lady Zhao persuades Jing Ke to perform the assassination. After learning of Ying Zheng&#x27;s massacre of the children in her home state of Zhao, Lady Zhao desires the assassination in earnest. The attempt fails, but Ying Zheng expresses his fury when his associates make no attempt to stop the assassin and he is forced to kill Jing Ke himself. He is further saddened when Lady Zhao returns to Qin only to retrieve Jing Ke for burial.

<doc id="781219" wikidata="Q1541608" url="?curid=781219" title="Teaching Mrs. Tingle">
<text>Teaching Mrs. Tingle is a 1999 American teen black comedy thriller film written and directed by Kevin Williamson in his directorial debut, and starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Marisa Coughlan, Barry Watson, and Jeffrey Tambor. It follows a trio of high school seniors who must prove their innocence to their vindictive history teacher, who accuses them of cheating on their final exams. Williamson wrote the script before his work on &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek.&quot; Following the success of those projects, his script was picked up and production of the film proceeded.

Released in the United States on August 20, 1999, the film was originally titled &quot;Killing Mrs. Tingle&quot; and had a darker tone. It was delayed, re-edited and retitled due to the uproar over teen violence in films after the Columbine High School massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview w/Kevin Williamson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb.

==Plot==
In Grandsboro, California, Leigh Ann Watson is a high school student living with her single mother, Faye, who works as a waitress. Leigh Ann&#x27;s goals are to get top grades, become valedictorian, and leave town. However, her grade in history class is threatened by her teacher, Mrs. Eve Tingle, who has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and downgrades her well-designed project due to a minor historical inaccuracy. Fellow student Luke Churner makes a copy of Tingle&#x27;s final exam and offers it to Leigh Ann, but she declines. However, Luke stashes the copy in Leigh Ann&#x27;s backpack. Tingle discovers the copy and threatens to expel her. Tingle immediately heads to Principal Potter&#x27;s office, but he has left for the day so she decides to tell him in the morning.

Leigh Ann, her best friend Jo Lynn Jordan, and Luke visit Tingle&#x27;s house that night and try to persuade her that Leigh Ann is innocent. Tingle, however, refuses to listen. Luke threatens Tingle with a loaded crossbow, fellow student Brian Berry&#x27;s project. A physical struggle ensues, and in the ensuing mêlée, Tingle is accidentally knocked unconscious. The trio panic and tie Tingle to her bed. Leigh Ann returns to her house and promises to return in the morning, while Luke and Jo Lynn are left to watch Tingle. While under Jo Lynn&#x27;s watch, Tingle regains consciousness, and playing on her guilt, asks to be untied. Tingle immediately attacks Jo Lynn, but is restrained again by Luke.

The next morning, Jo Lynn calls the school and impersonates Tingle, calling in sick. Leigh Ann and Luke go to school, leaving Jo Lynn to watch Tingle. When they return, the trio devise a plan to blackmail Tingle by using fake photos of Luke and Tingle in bed together. Meanwhile, Tingle plays mind games with Jo Lynn, concerning her jealousy about Leigh Ann&#x27;s supposed relationship with Luke. Later that day, the plan goes awry when Coach Richard Wenchell, the school&#x27;s married gym teacher and Tingle&#x27;s secret lover, visits the house. Jo Lynn, again, impersonates Tingle and blindfolds Coach Wenchell to hide her identity. When Wenchell passes out after a high intake of alcohol, the trio decide to blackmail Tingle by producing photographic evidence of her affair with Wenchell.

While Leigh Ann and Luke leave to have the pictures printed and take an unconscious Wenchell back home, Tingle reveals to Jo Lynn that Leigh Ann and Luke spent the night together at a party. Distraught, Jo Lynn leaves. When Leigh Ann and Luke arrive back, Leigh Ann berates Tingle for hating her because she has, unlike Tingle herself, the potential to leave town and experience life. Tingle retaliates that she used to be like Leigh Ann and that Tingle herself is Leigh Ann&#x27;s future. In response, Leigh Ann and Luke have sex downstairs. Later, the two find Tingle&#x27;s grade book. Leigh Ann marks down her rival Trudie Tucker&#x27;s top A grade down to a B, and upgrades her own C to an A+. Tingle tells Jo Lynn and she confronts Leigh Ann of the sex. Leigh Ann confesses and Jo Lynn walks off in anger.

The next day at school, Jo Lynn ignores Leigh Ann, still hurt over the revelation. Leigh Ann tries to make amends, but admits that she had sex with Luke, further infuriating Jo Lynn. Tingle escapes from her bonds, ties Luke down in her place, and using the loaded crossbow, threatens Leigh Ann. Jo Lynn returns in a failed attempt to persuade Tingle she will help her blackmail Leigh Ann. After a violent fight, Tingle fires the crossbow, hitting Trudie in the chest as she enters the house. Leigh Ann checks her pulse and says she is dead. Potter arrives to check up on Tingle and is horrified by the scene. Guilt-ridden, Tingle confesses that she shot Trudie and wanted to make Leigh Ann fail like Tingle did herself. However, Trudie was protected by the thick textbook she was holding to her chest and is completely unharmed, which Leigh Ann already knew. Potter calls the police and fires Tingle. The film ends with Leigh Ann being named valedictorian at graduation.

==Production==
===Casting===
Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Sally Field were considered for the role of Mrs. Eve Tingle, the antagonist. Gillian Anderson was offered the role of Mrs. Tingle, but turned it down. Alicia Silverstone was considered for the role of Leigh Ann Watson, the protagonist.

Katie Holmes, who then had a principal role on Kevin Williamson&#x27;s TV series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, was cast as Leigh Ann in February 1998. Shortly after, Helen Mirren was cast in the role of Mrs. Tingle. Of Mirren, Williamson said, &quot;I think Helen Mirren is one of the greatest living actresses that we have and the fact that she wanted to play this role was amazing. She elevated Mrs. Tingle to a new level.&quot;

Of her casting, Mirren said, &quot;This is not the sort of film that I&#x27;m usually associated with, so I was thrilled that Kevin would think of me for this role.&quot; Mirren commented, &quot;For me &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; addresses teenagers&#x27; insecurities, ambitions, and fears about the future. Remembering back to the ages of Leigh Ann, Luke, and Jo Lynn, fear of the future is the most powerful thing driving you on. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen to you and it&#x27;s terrifying. I think adults forget how scary that is.&quot;

===Filming===
Production began in April 1998 on a budget of $14 million. The film was entirely shot in the Los Angeles area and wrapped in July 1998. The fictional Grandsboro High School was a combination of location work filmed at Rose City High School in Pasadena, Culver City High School in Culver City, and sound stage sets at Culver Studios. Exterior shots of Mrs. Tingle&#x27;s house took place at a Victorian-style residence in Pasadena.

===Controversy===
Originally called &quot;Killing Mrs. Tingle&quot;, the film was intended to have an earlier release date and an R rating. Its overall tone was darker, with certain characters being killed off. Holmes&#x27; character, Leigh Ann, was also much less sympathetic; in a 2023 interview, Williamson revealed the character was supposed to be a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; type of person, who had no issue with people dying if it meant accomplishing her goals.

Owing to the Columbine High School massacre that occurred on April 20, 1999—and the ensuing public outcry over the portrayal of violence in the media—the re-titled film was pushed back to August, with certain scenes being reshot or re-edited to earn a PG-13 rating.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 19% based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;As a dark comedy-thriller, this movie lacks humor and thrill.&quot; On Metacritic, the film scored 35 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars and compared the film to &quot;Election&quot; in its concept, but said that &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; fell short of &quot;Election&quot; in wit, and in that &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; had no sympathetic characters; although he complimented Mirren&#x27;s acting. Common Sense Media gave the film 1 star of out of 5, calling it a &quot;misguided teen thriller&quot;.
There were some positive reviews for the film. Thom Bennett of Film Journal International praised the film, calling it &quot;an entertaining film full of Williamson&#x27;s familiar movie-reference-laced dialogue&quot;. Michael Dequina of The Movie Reporter gave the film 3 out of 4 stars calling the film &quot;admittedly junky but wickedly watchable revenge fantasy&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was a box-office bomb; it made US$3.3 million in its opening weekend, debuting at number 10 at the North American box office. However, by its second week, the film dropped down to number 15 and brought in $2,344,298. The film continued to drop, and on its final week in the box office, the film was at number 44. By the end of its run, the film grossed $8,951,935 at the domestic box office against an estimated budget of $13 million.

==Music==

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack was released by Capitol Records on August 17, 1999. The album features music from Eve 6, The Moffatts, Stretch Princess, Tara MacLean, Duncan Sheik, Kendall Payne, Sozzi, Bree Sharp, Radford, and Eman.

===Score===

The score was composed by John Frizzell and was released as an album on August 24, 1999, by Varèse Sarabande.

<doc id="781227" wikidata="Q4216208" url="?curid=781227" title="Shirt of Nessus">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Shirt of Nessus, Tunic of Nessus, Nessus-robe, or Nessus&#x27; shirt () was the poisoned shirt (chiton) that killed Heracles. It was once a popular reference in literature. In folkloristics, it is considered an instance of the &quot;poison dress&quot; motif.

== Mythology ==
Fearing that Heracles had taken a new lover in Iole, his wife Deianeira gives him the garment, which was stained with the blood of the centaur Nessus. She had been tricked by the dying Nessus into believing it would serve as a potion to ensure her husband&#x27;s faithfulness. In fact, it contained the venom of the Lernaean Hydra with which Heracles had poisoned the arrow he used to kill Nessus. When Heracles puts it on, the Hydra&#x27;s venom begins to cook him alive, and to escape this unbearable pain he builds a funeral pyre and throws himself on it.

Metaphorically, it represents &quot;a source of misfortune from which there is no escape; a fatal present; anything that wounds the susceptibilities&quot; or a &quot;destructive or expiatory force or influence&quot;.

==Historical references==
===Münster Rebellion===
During the anabaptist Münster Rebellion of 1534, a fifteen-year-old girl named Hille Feyken (or Feiken) attempted to deceive Münster&#x27;s Prince-Bishop Franz von Waldeck, who had been commanding a protracted siege of the city. Her plan was to pretend to defect and entice the Bishop with information about the city&#x27;s defenses while giving him a handsome shirt soaked in poison. Before her plan could be carried out she was betrayed by another defector, who warned the bishop, and Feyken was tortured and killed.

===Hitler plot===
Major-General Henning von Tresckow, one of the primary conspirators in the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, famously referred to the &quot;Robe of Nessus&quot; following the realization that the assassination plot had failed and that he and others involved in the conspiracy would lose their lives as a result: &quot;None of us can complain about our own deaths. Everyone who joined our circle put on the &#x27;Robe of Nessus&#x27;.&quot; Tresckow himself, echoing Heracles, committed suicide by grenade on the Eastern Front, shortly after the failure of the putsch.

==References in literature==

===John Barth===

&quot;The Shirt of Nessus&quot; (1952) is the master&#x27;s thesis of the noted American postmodern novelist John Barth. Written for the Writing Seminars program at Johns Hopkins, which Barth himself later ran, &quot;The Shirt of Nessus&quot; is in the form of a short novel or novella. It is his first full-length fictional work, but little is known of its content. Barth has revealed himself to be embarrassed by most of his unpublished work before &quot;The Floating Opera&quot;. &quot;The Shirt of Nessus&quot; is briefly referenced in both of Barth&#x27;s nonfiction collections, &quot;The Friday Book&quot; and &quot;Further Fridays&quot;. The only known copies not held by the author were kept in the Johns Hopkins and the Writing Seminars libraries, but the Writing Seminars copy disappeared in the mid-1960s, and other has also disappeared. Some Johns Hopkins faculty members who know Barth speculate that he may have removed them. Indeed, when the special collections division notified Barth in 2002 (when the volume was first found to be missing), Barth responded that he &quot;was not altogether unhappy the library no longer had a copy&quot;. However, the novelist and scholar David Morell in his &quot;John Barth: An Introduction&quot;, notes that he has a copy.

===Robert Duncan===

In the &quot;Introduction&quot; to &quot;Bending the Bow&quot;: &quot;Pound sought coherence in The Cantos and comes in Canto 116 to lament &#x27;and I cannot make it cohere.&#x27; But the &#x27;SPLENDOUR, IT ALL COHERES&#x27; of the poet&#x27;s Herakles in The Women of Trachis is a key or recognition of a double meaning that turns in the lock of the Nessus shirt.&quot;

In Audit/Poetry IV.3, issue featuring Robert Duncan, in his long polemic with Robin Blaser&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Chimeras&quot; of Gérard de Nerval, which Duncan believes deliberately and fatally omit the mystical and gnostic overtones of the original, Duncan writes: &quot;The mystical doctrine of neo-Pythagorean naturalism has become like a Nessus shirt to the translator, and in the translation we hear Heracles&#x27; tortured cry from Pound&#x27;s version of the Women of Trachis from Sophokles: &#x27;it all coheres.&#x27;&quot;

===Hyam Plutzik===
In Hyam Plutzik&#x27;s poem &quot;Portrait&quot;, which appears in his collection &quot;Apples From Shinar&quot;, the poet writes of a Jewish-American character in the late 1950s who has successfully assimilated, and is able to &quot;ignore the monster, the mountain—/A few thousand years of history.&quot; Except for one problem, &quot;one ill-fitting garment…The shirt, the borrowed shirt, /The Greek shirt.&quot; The last line reveals the &quot;Greek shirt&quot; is &quot;a shirt by Nessus.&quot;

===Other appearances in fiction===
*In James Branch Cabell&#x27;s &quot;Jurgen&quot;, the title character dons the shirt of Nessus and is transported by it on his travels, in the end of the story he is allowed to take it off, in contradiction to the usual conventions.
*Lucy Larcom&#x27;s anti-war and anti-slavery ballad &quot;Weaving&quot; is a soliloquy of a northern factory woman working at her loom who compares the cloth she weaves with a Nessus-robe for the Southern slave women who suffered to produce the cotton.
*In Alexander Dumas (Pere)&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, the Royal Prosecutor, M. Gerard de Villefort is referenced to have, after being exposed of his crimes, &quot;threw aside his magisterial robe because it was an unbearable burden, a veritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture.&quot;
====References in Film and Television====
*In the 1994 movie &quot;Hercules in the Underworld&quot;, similar to the original myth, Nessus tricks Deianeira into believing his blood will keep Hercules faithful. When she suspects Hercules is having an affair with Iole, she sends him a cloak smeared with the blood. When he puts it on, it comes to life and tries to strangle him, but he manages to tear it off and destroy it.

===References in non-fiction===
*&quot;The Shirt of Nessus&quot; is a 1956 non-fiction book dealing with anti-Nazi groups in Germany during World War II.
*The Polish dissident writer Jan Józef Lipski published a collection of essays called &quot;Tunika Nessosa&quot; (&quot;The Shirt of Nessos&quot;), dealing with, and critical of, Polish Catholic nationalism. Lipski called nationalism the shirt of Nessos, which destroys the cultural genius of a nation.
*Uri Avnery has compared the territories occupied by Israel after the Six-Day War to the Shirt of Nessus.

<doc id="781253" wikidata="Q1182355" url="?curid=781253" title="Deep Blue Something">
<text>Deep Blue Something is an American rock band, known for the 1995 hit single &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; from their second album &quot;Home&quot;. &quot;Home&quot; achieved gold-record status; however, the band parted ways with Interscope Records and went on creative hiatus for several years, only releasing the follow-up &quot;Byzantium&quot; in Japan and some European countries. They eventually signed with the Aezra label and released &quot;Deep Blue Something&quot; in 2001, breaking up shortly after. The band regrouped with all members at the end of 2014 and signed to drummer John Kirtland&#x27;s independent label, Kirtland Records.

==History==
The group was founded in 1991 in Denton, Texas, by brothers Todd and Toby Pipes, then students at the University of North Texas. The brothers enlisted drummer John Kirtland and guitarist Clay Bergus. Deep Blue Something originally performed as Leper Messiah, after the line from David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

Bergus left the band before the band started recording their first album, &quot;11th Song&quot;. The band independently released the album in 1993. Kirk Tatom joined the band after the album&#x27;s release. In 1994, the band released their second album, &quot;Home&quot;, via an independent label named RainMaker Records. &quot;Home&quot; was re-released a year later by major label Interscope Records. The accompanying single &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the charts in the United Kingdom. According to Todd Pipes, the lyrics of the song were inspired by Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s performance in the feature film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, but he thought that the Hepburn film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; would make a better song title.

The huge success of the single and lack of follow-up activity led to their classification as a one-hit-wonder band within music circles. 
In late 1995, Tatom left the band and Bergus returned to his role as guitarist. The band worked on their third album, titled &quot;Byzantium&quot;, with a planned release in 1996. However, Deep Blue Something came into legal troubles over the copyright of &quot;11th Song&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. Although the lawsuits were finally settled, Interscope put the album on hold, focusing on other label artists such as Limp Bizkit. Interscope eventually released the album in 1998, but only in Japan.

The band then sued Interscope and won a release from their contract. They later signed with Aezra Records, an independent label based in Phoenix, Arizona. Their self-titled album, which contains five tracks from &quot;Byzantium&quot;, was released by Aezra in 2001. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the band &quot;drifted apart,&quot; and its members worked on separate projects for over a decade.

In 2014, Todd Pipes posted an Instagram photo teasing that the band was back together and working on a new project, eventually revealed to be an EP titled &quot;Locust House&quot;. The EP was released as a digital download on June 29, 2015.

==Other activities of band members==
Todd and Toby Pipes have become producers for Flickerstick, Demp, Calhoun, the Greater Good, Coma Rally, Moonshot Radio, Porter Block, and The Nadas. They have earned Best Producer honors from the &quot;Fort Worth Weekly&quot; three years in a row and have been highlighted in &quot;Mix Magazine&quot;. The Pipes brothers work primarily out of Bass Propulsion Laboratories in Dallas, a three-studio facility which they also own.

Todd Pipes (born November 9, 1967), has released a solo album, &quot;Taurus Petals&quot;, on Authentic Records. It was released on November 25, 2008. Later on he released an EP, &quot;Polar Patterns&quot;, on Idol Records. It was released on September 25, 2012. He released an EP &quot;Mainsail To Skyking&quot; on Idol Records. It was released on August 3, 2018.

Toby Pipes (born June 28, 1971), formed the band The Hundred Inevitables, with Jeff Whittington and released an album, &quot;Studder&quot;, in early 2000. In 2005, he formed a new band Little Black Dress with Nolan Thies. In 2009 they were the first band signed onto Exploding Plastic Records, a new Idol Records sub-label. Their debut album &quot;Snow in June&quot; was released June 2009.

John Kirtland runs an independent record label, Kirtland Records. Based in Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, Kirtland&#x27;s business dealings led to his ownership of the back-catalog of the band Bush and royalty rights on the sales of certain albums by the band No Doubt. Kirtland quickly sold off his rights to the No Doubt material, but retained the rights to the Bush back catalog until 2014, when they were sold to a consortium that included Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale. However, Kirtland Records continues to feature Texas-based indie bands such the Burden Brothers, The Polyphonic Spree and Toadies, and was the issuing label for Deep Blue Something&#x27;s 2015 EP, &quot;Locust House&quot;.

Clay Bergus has been a manager at Eddie V&#x27;s Prime Seafood in Fort Worth since its opening in spring 2009.

Kirk Tatom formed an acoustic duo with fellow Texas musician Greg Beutel, performing under the name Whiskey Pants.

<doc id="781266" wikidata="Q2526982" url="?curid=781266" title="1972 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1972 Atlantic hurricane season was a significantly below average season, having only seven named storms, four fully tropical storms (the fewest since 1930) and three subtropical storms. It officially began on June 1, 1972, and lasted until November 30, 1972. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm, Subtropical Storm Alpha, developed on May 23 off the Southeast United States and struck Florida, causing minor damage and two fatalities.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Agnes, which at the time was the costliest United States hurricane, until Frederic in 1979. After brushing the western tip of Cuba, the hurricane made landfall on the Florida Panhandle. It caused at least $2.1 billion (1972 USD) in damage and 137 fatalities, mostly from inland flooding in Pennsylvania and New York. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betty, which reached peak winds of while west of the Azores. Tropical Storm Carrie passed just offshore of Massachusetts, causing heavy rainfall and resulting in four fatalities, but leaving only $1.78 million in damage. The remaining tropical systems caused no significant effects on land.

Due to a strong El Niño only three systems strengthened into hurricanes, none of which intensified into major hurricanes. This was the first season to name subtropical storms, and did so using the Phonetic Alphabet. Collectively, the storms of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 137 deaths and over $2.1 billion in damage.
== Season summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1972. Although 19 tropical cyclones developed, only seven of were named, below the 1950-2000 average of 9.6 named storms per season. Of the seven tropical or subtropical storms, three of them strengthened into hurricanes, which is also below average. None of the three hurricanes became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Overall, the season was inactive, despite having a similar number of tropical waves as the previous season. The lack of activity was attributed to an El Niño – which causes below normal sea surface temperatures over the eastern Atlantic – and strong vertical wind shear. One subtropical storm and two hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 137 fatalities and more than $2.1 billion in damage. The last storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Delta, became extratropical on November 7, about 23 days before the official end of hurricane season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis first occurred in the month of May, with the development of Subtropical Storm Alpha. The month of June featured three tropical cyclones, including Hurricane Agnes and two tropical depressions. Three more systems formed in July, though all of them failed to reach tropical storm status. August was the most active month of the season, with five systems, including Hurricane Betty, Tropical Storm Carrie, and three tropical depressions. September featured slightly less cyclogenesis, with Hurricane Dawn, Subtropical Storm Charlie, and two tropical depressions. An additional three tropical depressions formed in October. Subtropical Storm Delta was the sole system in November, lasting from November 1 to November 7.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating of 36, the lowest value since 1962. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Betty, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of . Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.

== Systems ==

=== Subtropical Storm Alpha ===
A subtropical depression developed from a cold-core low pressure area southeast of the Carolinas on May 23. After initially moving northeastward, it turned sharply southward on May 26 due to a building ridge of high pressure. Later that day, the system strengthened into Subtropical Storm Alpha and proceeded to move toward the coast of Georgia. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of , Alpha began weakening. Late on May 27, the storm made landfall near Brunswick, Georgia, with winds of . Alpha weakened to a subtropical depression and dissipated after entering the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on May 29.

Rough seas generated by the storm resulted in two people drowning in Florida and halted work to deepen a harbor at the Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville. Tides along the Georgia coast reached above normal, which caused some flooding and beach erosion. Wind gusts reached on Saint Simons Island. The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving some people without power in eastern Georgia. Damage was minor but widespread in the state, estimated at over $50,000. Moderate rains spread in coastal areas from South Carolina through southern Florida. North Carolina also experienced about $50,000 in damage, mostly due to erosion. Alpha was the first named subtropical storm.
=== Hurricane Agnes ===

A polar front and an upper trough over the Yucatán Peninsula spawned a tropical depression on June 14. The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June 15, and by the following day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes. The storm curved northward and brushed western Cuba on June 17. Agnes continued to intensify, and on June 18, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Minimal fluctuations in intensity occurred before the storm made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on June 19. After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. Thereafter, weakening slowed as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. However, while over eastern North Carolina on June 21, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. Agnes quickly merged with a non-tropical low pressure system on June 23.

Heavy rainfall occurred in western Cuba, causing flooding that destroyed 97 houses, isolated a few cities, and flatted crops in low-lying areas. The storm left seven fatalities. Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak, with at least 26 confirmed twisters, 24 of them in Florida and the other two in Georgia. The tornadoes alone resulted in over $4.5 million in damage and six fatalities. At least 2,082 structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. About 1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses. Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. The storm left nine deaths and approximately $40 million in damage in Florida. Generally minor effects were also recorded in the states of Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee, as well as the New England region. However, one fatality was reported in Delaware and three were recorded in Georgia.

The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to severe flooding. Precipitation peaked at in Schuylkill County, causing several creeks and rivers crest at record height, including the Delaware, Juniata, Lackawanna, Susquehanna, and West Branch Susquehanna rivers. More than 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding. In the state of Pennsylvania, more than 3,000 businesses and 68,000 homes were destroyed, leaving at least 220,000 people homeless. Agnes remains one of the worst natural disasters in Pennsylvania. New York also suffered severe damage. Similarly, rivers in the state crested high, including the Allegheny, Chemung, Genesee, Susquehanna, and Tioga rivers. Corning, Elmira, and Olean, as well as many other Southern Tier towns, were severely flooded. Throughout New York, 32,832 homes were damaged and 628 others were damaged. A total of 1,547 small businesses were extensively damaged or demolished. In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people. Overall, Agnes caused 131 fatalities and over $2.1 billion in damage.
=== Hurricane Betty (Bravo) ===

An area of disturbed weather appeared on satellite imagery while forming within an old frontal zone on August 21. At 1200 UTC on the following day, a subtropical depression developed about north-northeast of Bermuda. The system strengthened slowly as it headed east-northeastward or eastward and by August 24, it became Subtropical Storm Bravo. During the next 24 hours, minimal intensification occurred. However, a deepening high-level trough and a building ridge enhanced outflow and deep convection on August 25. Additionally, reconnaissance aircraft flights began indicating a transition to a warm-core. Unfavorable northwesterly winds briefly halted further development, though by late on August 26, Bravo resumed acquiring tropical characteristics after another deepening trough accelerated the storm eastward.

After reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of and satellite imagery indicated a storm with a classic cyclonic appearance, Bravo was reclassified as Hurricane Betty while located about west of the Azores on August 27. After some further strengthening, Betty attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of early on August 28. The hurricane then moved rapidly east-northeastward before decelerating late on the following day. Around that time, northerly winds aloft caused Betty to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane. After briefly moving southward, the storm curved back to a general westward direction and fell to tropical storm intensity on August 31. Later that day, Betty turned northward ahead of a trough and became extratropical about northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on September 1.
=== Tropical Storm Carrie ===
A complex system combining a tropical wave and an upper-level low led to the formation of a tropical depression east of Florida on August 29. It managed to become a tropical storm on August 31 and reached initial peak winds of later that day. However, upper-level winds increased, causing Carrie to weaken to a minimal tropical storm by September 2. Due to baroclinic processes, Carrie began to re-intensify. As a result, Carrie attained its peak winds of just prior to transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 3. The extratropical cyclone continued northeastward, and struck eastern Maine on September 4. By the following day, the extratropical cyclone dissipated over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached and rainfall exceeded . Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. Overall, damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1.78 million. Four deaths were blamed on the storm.
=== Hurricane Dawn ===

A tropical wave, combined with an upper tropospheric trough, resulted in the development of a tropical depression near Cay Sal Bank, Bahamas, on September 5. Later that day, the depression struck Key Largo, Florida, before moving inland over the mainland of Florida. The storm brought very light rainfall to the state, peaking at in Tavernier. The system moved northeastward and soon re-emerged into the Atlantic. While located north of Grand Bahama on September 6, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dawn. On September 7, a cold low pressure developed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, which would influence much of Dawn&#x27;s movement. Around that time, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Dawn then curved west-northwestward on September 8 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of .

With Dawn appearing as a threat to the Mid-Atlantic, storm and gale warnings were issued from Chincoteague Inlet, Virginia, to Cape May, New Jersey, on September 8. However, the hurricane veered southeastward on September 9 and weakened to a tropical storm. By late on September 10, after the cold low pressure area relinquished influence over Dawn, the cyclone began moving westward, but continued to deteriorate. Dawn weakened to a tropical depression while well east of Georgia late on September 12. The system approached the Sea Islands on September 13, but curved northeastward and remained offshore. Dawn dissipated less than east of Isle of Palms, South Carolina, on September 14. The storm also produced very light rainfall in Georgia and South Carolina.
=== Subtropical Storm Charlie ===

A very small, circular subtropical depression developed about northeast of Bermuda on September 19. Initially, the storm moved north-northeastward and strengthened into Subtropical Storm Charlie early the following day. It then moved quickly northeastward and continued to strengthen. Later on September 20, Charlie peaked with maximum sustained winds of . The system soon lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, early on September 21. However, the extratropical storm deepened significantly, reaching a barometric pressure of , a reading typical of a strong Category 3 hurricane. Early on September 22, the extratropical cyclone dissipated over the far north Atlantic.
=== Subtropical Storm Delta ===

A southwestward-moving cold-core low pressure area developed into a subtropical depression while located about west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on November 1. After forming, the system soon strengthened and was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Delta. Early on November 3, Delta attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Around that time, the subtropical storm briefly moved southward, before beginning a general eastward movement on November 4. Delta soon began to weaken and was reduced to a subtropical depression by the following day. It continued eastward until November 6, at which time the storm decelerated and curved northward. Delta dissipated while located about southwest of Flores Island.
=== Other systems ===

In addition to the named storms, there were several weak depressions during the season. As Agnes was moving over the southeastern United States, a tropical depression formed approximately southwest of Bermuda on June 19. It moved northeastward and headed toward the island. The depression dissipated later the following day. The next tropical Depression developed offshore North Florida on July 10. Moving generally northward, the system made landfall near Cape Fear in North Carolina on July 12. The depression dissipated over Virginia about two days later. Generally light rainfall was reported in several states, though of precipitation was recorded on Cedar Island, North Carolina. Another tropical depression originated about southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on July 16. It trekked slowly until July 19, at which time the system curved northeastward. Late the following day, the depression dissipated about west of Flores Island. On July 31, a tropical depression formed about southeast of Bermuda. The depression moved southwestward, toward the Bahamas and Lesser Antilles, but dissipated about northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands on August 3.

A tropical depression developed over Senegal on August 5. Tracking westward, the depression passed south of Cape Verde before dissipating southwest of the islands on August 8. Four days later, another tropical depression originated about east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. It moved slowly northeastward and intensified slightly, but dissipated about southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on August 15. The tenth tropical depression formed on August 16 while offshore Senegal. Moving generally westward, the cyclone crossed through Cape Verde and struck the islands of Fogo and Santiago. By August 18, the depression dissipated. Another tropical depression developed about east-southeast of Bermuda on September 3. The system moved northeastward toward the Azores, but degenerated about southwest of Flores Island on September 5. The next tropical depression formed on September 20 while located about west-southwest of Cape Verde. The storm tracked generally westward, but then began moving west-northwestward on September 21. Three days later, the depression dissipated about east-northeast of Barbados.

On October 1, a tropical depression originated about east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression tracked generally northward and dissipated about south-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, on October 3. Another tropical depression formed about west of Bolama, Guinea-Bissau, on October 5. The depression moved generally westward, before curving to the northwest on October 8. Five days later, it turned northward while well northeast of the Lesser Antilles. By October 14, the system began moving north-northeast. The depression dissipated about east-northeast of Bermuda on the following day. Yet another tropical depression formed about southwest of Brava, Cape Verde, on October 16. Initially the depression moved generally west-northwestward and dissipated about halfway between Barbados and Cape Verde.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named tropical storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1972. Storms were named &quot;Agnes&quot;, &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot; for the first (and only, in the case of Agnes) time in 1972.

The NATO phonetic alphabet (below) was used to designates subtropical cyclones that formed in the north Atlantic in 1972. Subtropical Storm Bravo became Betty after acquiring tropical characteristics.

=== Retirement ===

After the end of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season, the name &quot;Agnes&quot; was retired due to the amount of damage and loss of life.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1972 USD.

<text>The 1973 Atlantic hurricane season was a below average tropical cyclone season overall. Of the 24 tropical or subtropical cyclones which developed, only 8 became named storms, and of those, only 4 became hurricanes, with 1 reaching major hurricane status (Category 3 or higher) on the newly implemented Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.

The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclones form in the North Atlantic. However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated this season by the formation of multiple pre-season systems, none of which attained storm strength. The first named storm of the year, Hurricane Alice, did not form until July 1. 

Two of the season&#x27;s landfalling storms had severe impacts. In August, Hurricane Brenda struck the eastern coast of the Bay of Campeche, killing 10 people in Campeche, and causing the worst flooding there in decades. Then, early in September, Tropical Storm Delia hit the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coast, inundating parts of Texas and Louisiana with significant rainfall, which resulted in 5 fatalities and $6 million (1973 USD) in damage. The most intense cyclone of the season was Hurricane Ellen, which reached Category 3 strength during its trek over open water. Also, the season&#x27;s final named storm, Tropical Storm Gilda, was meteorologically significant in that it became the first documented tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. 


== Season summary ==

The first storm of the 1973 hurricane season, forming in mid-April, developed more than a month before the official start of the season. Several other short-lived, weak depressions formed before and during June; however, none reached storm intensity. The first named storm, Alice, formed on July 1. Tracking generally to the north, Alice also became the first hurricane of the season as well as the first known cyclone to impact Bermuda during July. Shortly after Alice dissipated over Atlantic Canada, another depression formed. By the end of July, two more non-developing depressions formed and the first subtropical cyclone, given the name Alfa, developed off the east coast of the United States. This storm was short-lived and dissipated on August 2 just offshore southern Maine. The first half August was relatively quiet, with only one depression forming. However, later in the month, the season&#x27;s second hurricane, Brenda, formed in the northwestern Caribbean. Peaking just below Category 2 status on the newly introduced Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, Brenda made the first recorded landfall in the Mexican State of Campeche.
Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine became the easternmost forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, developing over the western African country of Guinea on August 25. The system traveled for several thousand miles before dissipating in the eastern Caribbean Sea in early September. At the start of the month, a new tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico. This storm, named Delia, became the first known cyclone to make landfall in the same city twice. After moving inland a second time, Delia eventually dissipated on September 7. As Delia dissipated another depression formed in the same region, eventually making landfall in the same city as Delia, Freeport, Texas. Another brief depression formed several days later. On September 13, the strongest storm of the season, Ellen, formed over the eastern Atlantic. After tracking northwest for several days, Ellen eventually attained hurricane status as it turned westward. Several days later, the hurricane turned northeast due to an approaching frontal system. Shortly before becoming extratropical, Ellen reached major hurricane intensity at a record northerly latitude.

In late September, a brief depression affected northern Florida before dissipating. After a week of inactivity, the second subtropical storm of the year formed over the central Atlantic. This storm, named Bravo, gradually intensified, becoming fully tropical, at which time it was renamed Fran, a few days later. Upon being renamed, Fran had intensified into a hurricane and maintained this intensity for several days before dissipating east of the Azores on October 12. A few days after Fran dissipated, the final named storm of the year formed in the central Caribbean Sea. A slow moving system, Gilda gradually intensified just below hurricane-intensity before striking Cuba and moving over the Bahamas. A few days after passing through the islands, Gilda became the first storm on record to transition from a tropical cyclone into a subtropical cyclone. A large storm, Gilda eventually became extratropical near Atlantic Canada and dissipated later that month. Around the time Gilda was dissipating, a weak depression briefly existed near the Azores. The final storm of the year was a strong depression in the southern Caribbean Sea. This system was active for less than two days but may have briefly attained tropical storm intensity as it made landfall in southern Nicaragua.

== Systems ==

=== Hurricane Alice ===

The first named storm formed out of the interaction between tropical wave and a mid-level tropospheric trough northeast of the Bahamas in late-June. A well-defined circulation became apparent by June 30 and satellite images depicted cyclonic banding features. The following day, the system intensified into a tropical depression and shortly thereafter became a tropical storm as reconnaissance aircraft recorded gale-force winds. An area of high pressure to the east of Alice steered the storm generally to the north. Decreasing wind shear allowed the storm to become increasingly organized and a well-defined eye developed by July 3. By this time, reconnaissance had determined that the storm had intensified into a hurricane, with maximum winds reaching 80 mph (130 km/h).

On July 4, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986 mbar (hPa; ), as the eastern portion of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. After passing the island, Alice began to accelerate in response to a mid-level trough over the eastern United States and weakened. By July 6, winds head decreased below hurricane intensity as the storm neared Atlantic Canada. Later that day, Alice made landfall in western Newfoundland with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.

During its passage of Bermuda, Alice produced sustained winds up to 75 mph (120 km/h) and gusts to 87 mph (140 km/h). No major damage was recorded on the island, though the winds blew down a few trees and powerlines. The heavy rainfall, peaking at , ended a three-month drought in Bermuda. Although Alice tracked through Atlantic Canada, no impact was recorded.
=== Subtropical Storm Alfa ===

During late July, an upper-level low, with a non-tropical cold core, formed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and tracked southward. Gradually, the circulation lowered to the surface and developed subtropical characteristics. On July 31, the system attained gale-force winds off the Mid-Atlantic coast and was named Alfa, the first name from the list of subtropical storm names for the 1973 season. Tracking north-northeast, the system intensified very little as it paralleled the coastline. By August 1, the system weakened below subtropical storm intensity as it neared New England. The following day, Alfa dissipated just off the southern coast of Maine. The only effects from Alfa was light to moderate rainfall in New England, peaking at in Turners Falls, Massachusetts. Most of southern Maine recorded around , with a maximum of in Saco.
=== Hurricane Brenda ===
Hurricane Brenda originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 9; however, the initial wave quickly weakened upon entering the Atlantic Ocean. By August 13, the wave began to regenerate as it passed through the Lesser Antilles. Several days later, convection associated with the system consolidated into a central, organized mass and on August 18, the system had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression while situated near the Yucatán Channel. Early the next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Brenda as it made landfall in the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. After moving inland, a strong ridge of high pressure over Texas forced the storm to take an unusual track, eventually leading it to enter the Bay of Campeche on August 20.

Once back over water, Brenda began to intensify, attaining hurricane status late on August 20. The next day, a well-defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; ). The storm made landfall later that day near Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico at this intensity, becoming the first hurricane on record to strike the region. After moving inland, Brenda rapidly weakened to a depression by the morning of August 22 and dissipated later that day.

Already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least 18 people and left 200,000 homeless, Hurricane Brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding. The storm killed at least 10 people in the country. Following the damage wrought by Brenda, a large earthquake struck the region, hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures. Winds on land gusted up to 112 mph (180 km/h), leading to severe wind damage. Two of the fatalities occurred in Campeche after 80% of the city was flooded. This was considered the worst flooding in the city in over 25 years. An estimated 2,000 people were left homeless as a direct result of Brenda throughout Mexico. Offshore, a freighter with 25 crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed. They were safely rescued several days later once the storm had dissipated.
=== Tropical Storm Christine ===
Tropical Storm Christine originated from a tropical wave over Africa in mid-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave organized into a tropical depression inland over Guinea at 14.0°W. It steadily tracked west across the Atlantic, and attained tropical storm intensity on August 28. Despite the lack of aircraft reconnaissance in the region, the intensity was determined by wind readings from a German cargo ship that passed through the storm. On August 30, the first reconnaissance mission into the storm found tropical storm-force winds and the first advisory was issued that day, immediately declaring the system as Tropical Storm Christine. Three days later, Christine attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; ). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands. As it passed over Antigua on September 3, Christine weakened to a tropical depression and eventually dissipated near the Dominican Republic later that day.

During its passage through the Leeward Islands, Christine produced torrential rainfall, peaking at in southeastern Puerto Rico. These rains led to flooding on several islands. One person was killed during the storm after being electrocuted by a downed power line on a flooded road. Schools were closed ahead of the storm in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution following the issuance of flood warnings. Six scientists had to be evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine.
=== Tropical Storm Delia ===
On August 27, a tropical wave formed over the central Caribbean and tracked towards the west-northwest. The system gradually developed organized shower and thunderstorm activity. By September 1, a tropical depression developed from the wave. By September 3, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Delia, and began tracking more towards the west. A complex steering pattern began to take place later on that day, resulting in the creation of a more hostile environment for tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico. As Delia neared the Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). The lowest pressure was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; ) at this time. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone made its first landfall in Freeport, Texas late on September 4. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made landfall in Freeport again on September 5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September 6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico.

Due to the erratic track of the storm along the Texas coastline, widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in Louisiana. Tides up to , in addition to rainfall up to , caused significant flooding in the Galveston-Freeport area. Up to $3 million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding. Throughout Louisiana, there was substantial flooding of farmland. Damages to crops amounted to $3 million. In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia, eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm, injuring four people. Five people were killed during Delia, two drowned during floods, two died in a car accident and the other died from a heart attack while boarding up his home.
=== Tropical Depression Eleven ===

On September 6, a tropical depression formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea within a trough of low pressure extended southeastward from Delia, which was situated over southeast Texas at the time. The depression remained weak until it reached the Texas coastline on September 10. Once onshore, it produced significant rainfall, causing significant damage that was attributed to Tropical Storm Delia. After turning northeast and tracking inland, the depression quickly increased in forward speed before dissipating over North Carolina on September 14.

Along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, the depression produced significant amounts of rainfall, peaking at near Freeport. Several areas in southern Louisiana recorded rainfall exceeding with a maximum amount of falling in Kinder. Significant rainfall was also recorded in the Carolinas and Georgia, with numerous areas recording over . A maximum of fell near Whitmire, South Carolina before the system dissipated. In all, the depression resulted in an additional $22 million in crop losses in southern Louisiana.
=== Hurricane Ellen ===
The strongest storm of the season, Hurricane Ellen, began as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on September 13. On the following day, the wave spawned an area of low pressure south of the Cape Verde Islands that quickly became a tropical depression. Tracking northeast, the system intensified into a tropical storm on September 15 after sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) were reported by a French naval vessel; however, due to sparse data on the storm, the first advisory on Ellen was not issued for two more days. A slightly elongated storm, Ellen gradually intensified over the open Atlantic and was steered by two troughs of low pressure. On September 18, the storm took a nearly due west track and the system became increasingly organized, with an ill-defined eye becoming present on satellite imagery.

The next day, Ellen intensified into a hurricane before taking a sharp turn to the north-northwest in response to a weak trough moving northeast from the Bahamas. Gradually, the hurricane turned more towards the northeast and began to accelerate as well as intensify. Despite being at an unusually high latitude for development, the storm underwent a brief period of rapid intensification, strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane on September 23. At that time, Ellen attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 962 mbar (hPa; ). Upon attaining this intensity at 42.1°N, Ellen had become a major hurricane farther north than any other tropical cyclone on record, and is one of two storms to become a major hurricane north of 38°N, the other being Hurricane Alex in 2004. Shortly after peaking, Ellen transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before merging with a frontal system several hundred miles east of Newfoundland on September 23.
=== Tropical Depression Thirteen ===

On September 24, a depression formed northeast of the Bahamas. The following day, the NHC issued their first advisory on the system, declaring it a subtropical depression. The depression was displayed an asymmetrical structure, with most winds being recorded up to north of the center. Later that day, the subtropical depression organized into a tropical depression. Upon doing so, the NHC issued small craft advisories for coastal areas between North Carolina and St. Augustine, Florida. Tracking north-northwestward in response to a break in a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression eventually made landfall near Marineland, Florida and quickly weakened, dissipating before reaching the Gulf of Mexico.

Heavy rain fell in association with the depression in parts of Florida and Georgia. A maximum of fell in Orlando while several other areas recorded over of rain. Over land, wind gusts reached 40 mph (65 km/h) in some locations. Offshore, swells produced by the system reached , impacting several vessels in the region. Minor beach erosion and coastal flooding was reported in parts of South Carolina as a result of the storm. In parts of coastal Georgia, high water resulted in several road closures and flooded a few homes. Police officers in Savannah reported that wave were topping the local seawall; however, no damage was reported.
=== Hurricane Fran (Bravo) ===

Hurricane Fran originated from a tropical wave associated with an area of convection north of Hispaniola on October 1. By October 4, the system interacted with a mid-tropospheric trough near the southeast United States, resulting in the formation of a surface low. Tracking eastward, showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation; however, the structure of the system was not fully tropical. On October 7, ships in the vicinity of the low reported decreasing barometric pressures, indicating a strengthening system. Satellites monitoring the system depicted a disorganized storm with mainly subtropical characteristics, affected by cooler air from a cold front. Late on October 8, the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression, and a day later the system was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Bravo. By October 10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly from the center of the storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as Hurricane Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a wide eye. Steered quickly eastward by a deep surface low in the westerlies, Fran accelerated towards the Azores Islands. By October 11, the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition, and around that time, Fran attained its peak winds of . Shortly after bypassing the Azores islands on October 12, the system moved over an area with sea surface temperatures around , well below what is required for tropical cyclone development. Later that day, the central pressure of Fran decreased to 978 mbar (hPa; ), the lowest recorded in relation to the hurricane. Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of France.

Although Fran passed near the Azores as a hurricane, winds on the islands only reached . On October 12, a French ship encountered the storm, recording sustained winds of and an air pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; ). Ships near the English and French coastlines recorded winds up to as the extratropical remnants of Fran passed through the region.
=== Tropical Storm Gilda ===
The precursor to Tropical Storm Gilda was a large convective system partially due to a tropical wave. It gradually became better organized over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and on October 15, a tropical depression formed off the coast of Nicaragua. As it drifted to the northeast, it strengthened to a tropical storm, peaking at 70 mph (110 km/h) winds. Before it hit the coast of Cuba, it weakened enough to cause only minor damage. By the time it struck the island, it had become very disorganized in nature.

On October 24, cool, dry air entered the newly developed convection, and as a result it transitioned into a subtropical cyclone. Gilda became the first tropical system to pass through a subtropical stage prior to becoming extratropical. The large circulation continued northeast before becoming extratropical on October 27. The remnants of Gilda intensified as they tracked near Atlantic Canada, attaining a central pressure of 968 mbar (hPa; ) near Cape Race, Newfoundland. The system eventually dissipated near southern Greenland on October 29.

Gilda caused heavy rain and mudslides in Jamaica, destroying six homes and killing six people. In Cuba, Gilda dropped over of rain, while 60 mph (95 km/h) winds were reported in the northern part of the country. In the Bahamas, Gilda caused significant crop damage from heavy rainfall and high tides. The storm&#x27;s persistent strong currents and easterly winds caused moderate beach erosion on the East Coast of the United States, mostly along the Florida coast. The extratropical remnants of the storm produced hurricane-force wind gusts over parts of Atlantic Canada, peaking at 75 mph (120 km/h); however, no damage was reported.
=== Other systems ===

There were several other systems during the year, that were classified as depressions by the National Hurricane Center. On April 18, Tropical Depression One formed northeast of the Bahamas and tracked in a curved motion before dissipating over open water on April 21. Several days later, on April 24, another depression formed in the same general region; however, this system was shorter lived and dissipated two days later without significant movement. On May 2, Tropical Depression Two formed over open waters. The cyclone tracked northeast and dissipated late on May 5 east-southeast of the Azores. On May 11, a brief depression formed near Bermuda but dissipated the following day. Roughly a week into the official hurricane season, the fifth depression of the year formed just offshore southeast Florida, near Miami. The system tracked northwest across the peninsula and briefly entered the Gulf of Mexico on June 8 before making landfall along the Florida Panhandle. The depression eventually dissipate on June 10 over South Carolina.

On June 24, Tropical Depression Three formed along Florida, this time just onshore near the Georgia border. The system slowly tracked northeastward before dissipating on June 26 southeast of the North–South Carolina border. As Hurricane Alice neared Bermuda on July 9, a depression formed near the east coast of the United States; however, the storm dissipated the following day. On July 19, Tropical Depression Five formed over the central Atlantic. This system did not intensify, remaining a weak depression and dissipated on July 21 without affecting land. The next day, a new depression formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea near the coast of Nicaragua. The depression tracked over Central America, briefly moving back over water in the Gulf of Honduras before making a second landfall in Belize. The system persisted over land for a few days before entering the eastern Pacific late on July 25.

Tropical Depression Seven was an unusually eastward forming system. The depression was first identified just offshore eastern Africa on August 9. Tracking rapidly towards the west, the depression dissipated on August 11 over open waters. In addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in September, a slow-moving depression formed south-southeast of Bermuda on September 8. Tracking generally northward, the depression dissipated early on September 10 without affecting land. Tropical Depression Fifteen formed on October 10, southwest of Hurricane Fran. This system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later. Later that month, a slow-moving depression formed near the Azores. This system tracked southeast and dissipated on October 30 without affecting land. The final system of the year, Tropical Depression Seventeen, formed near the northern coast of Panama on November 17. A strong depression, it neared tropical storm strength just prior to making landfall in northern Costa Rica on November 18; the system dissipated later that day over land.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named tropical storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1973. Storms were named &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;Delia&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot; and &quot;Fran&quot; for the first time in 1973. No names were retired following the season; however, an overhaul of the naming system in 1979 to include male names resulted in this list being discarded.

The NATO phonetic alphabet (below) was used to designates subtropical cyclones that formed in the north Atlantic in 1973. Subtropical Storm Bravo became Fran after acquiring tropical characteristics.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1973 USD.

<text>Thomas Francis Michael McCarthy (July 24, 1863 – August 5, 1922) was an American Major League Baseball player. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.

==Career==
McCarthy was born on July 24, 1863, in Boston, Massachusetts, the eldest son of seven surviving children to Daniel and Sarah McCarthy nee Healy. Daniel McCarthy was born in County Kerry, Ireland. After graduating from South Boston&#x27;s John A. Andrew Grammar School, McCarthy worked for a clothing company during the day and played baseball at night. In 1884, he went to work for a piano company, where he received $18 a week for work in their factory and play for the company baseball team. Later that year, McCarthy joined the Boston Reds in the Union Association as a starting pitcher and outfielder. In limited innings and at-bats, he played poorly, batting at a paltry .215 average, and lost all seven of his pitching appearances. McCarthy moved to the National League and played with the Boston Beaneaters the following season and the Philadelphia Quakers the following two years but failed to bat higher than .200 in any season, although in limited at-bats.

Setting aside aspirations of being a star pitcher, McCarthy finally settled into an everyday position in a lineup in with the St. Louis Browns in the American Association. With the Browns until , McCarthy scored over 100 runs each season and grew increasingly productive at the plate. He batted .350 in and drove in 95 runs in 1891. Although the shoddy record-keeping of the time prevents an accurate tally, he also asserted himself as a daring presence on the base-paths, by some accounts stealing over 100 bases in 1888 and approaching the mark in 1890.
McCarthy moved back to the National League to play for the Boston Beaneaters in and enjoyed his most productive seasons over the next few years. In , he drove in over 100 runs for the first time in his career, a feat that he repeated in while hitting 13 home runs. The press of the day called McCarthy and teammate Hugh Duffy the &quot;Heavenly Twins&quot;. Their Boston team was one of the most successful clubs of the era. McCarthy played for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in before retiring. He finished his career with a .292 batting average, 44 home runs and roughly 500 stolen bases.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career ended, McCarthy served as the head baseball coach at Holy Cross (1899–1900, 1904–1905, and 1916), Dartmouth (1906–1907), and Boston College (1920). He was also a scout for the Cincinnati Reds (1909–1912), Boston Braves (1913–1915) and Boston Red Sox (1920) and manager of the Newark Bears (1918). In 1921, he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers coaching staff.

In 1921, McCarthy had a severe attack of double pneumonia and was in critical condition. He recovered and traveled south for the winter. His health declined when he returned home and in June was diagnosed with cancer. He died on August 5, 1922.

==Hall of Fame selection==
McCarthy&#x27;s selection into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 has always been a controversial one due to his less than spectacular statistics, especially when compared to those of his fellow inductees and some players who have not yet been honored.

In his 2001 book, &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Sabermetrician Bill James makes the point that McCarthy was held in such high esteem because of his introduction of the &quot;hit and run&quot; play into the game. This play, among other novel strategies (such as batter to baserunner signals, etc.) that he and his Boston teammates utilized, were a clever and gentlemanly counter to the rough and tumble &quot;Baltimore&quot; style of play which was, at the time, giving baseball a bad name. Nevertheless, in the same book, James also said that McCarthy is the worst right fielder in the Hall of Fame. As of 2014, McCarthy had the lowest Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score of any player in the Hall of Fame.

According to &quot;SABR&quot;, McCarthy is also the only Union Association player elected to the Hall of Fame.

<text>Isabella of Cyprus (died in 1264) was a Cypriotic princess. She was the regent of Kingdom of Jerusalem on behalf of her nephew King Hugh II in 1263-1264.

==Family==
Isabella was the daughter of Hugh I, king of Cyprus, and Alice of Champagne, regent of Jerusalem. She married Henry, the youngest son of Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch, 1233. The union was suggested by John of Ibelin, Isabella&#x27;s granduncle and the leading nobleman of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, when he reconciled with Henry&#x27;s father following the War of the Lombards. Isabella and Henry had two children, Hugh and Margaret. Along with her son she raised her nephew Hugh of Brienne, son of her deceased elder sister Maria. 

==Regency==

Isabella&#x27;s brother, King Henry I of Cyprus, died in 1253. He was succeeded by his minor son, King Hugh II. Hugh was then regarded as heir presumptive of King Conrad III of Jerusalem, who lived in Europe, and was entitled to rule the mainland kingdom too as regent. But since Hugh also required a regent on the account of his minority, it was his mother, Plaisance of Antioch, who governed. Queen Plaisance died in 1261. As the young king&#x27;s only surviving aunt and closest relative, Isabella was entitled to be the next regent of Cyprus. She stood aside and allowed her son, Hugh of Antioch, to take up the regency. Hugh of Brienne, though son of the elder aunt, did not counter his claim. In 1264 he said the reason was his respect for his aunt who raised him.

The right to exercise regency of Jerusalem on behalf of the minor regent remained unclaimed by his family until 1263. Isabella stepped forward only after the Mamluk ruler of Egypt, Baibars, attacked Acre, the seat of the royal government. She then came to Acre with her husband, Henry. The law stated that the claimant to bailliage had to bring their ward when appearing before the High Court of Jerusalem. Since Isabella failed to do so, the High Court restricted her rule and refused to do homage and fealty to her. She then returned to Cyprus, leaving Henry to act on her behalf. She died in 1264, likely in the latter half of the year.

<text>Isabella of Lusignan (c.1224 – 14 January 1300) was a daughter of Hugh X of Lusignan and his wife Isabella of Angoulême, Dowager Queen of England. Isabella was half-sister to King Henry III of England. She was Dame de Beauvoir-sur Mer et de Mercillac.

== Lineage ==
Isabella&#x27;s year of birth is unknown. She is mentioned in the Treaty of Vendome in March 1227. She was the daughter of Hugh X de Lusignan, &quot;le Brun&quot;, Seigneur de Lusignan, Count of La Marche and Isabella of Angoulême, queen dowager of England.

==Life==
Isabella was betrothed by the treaty of Vendôme in March 1227 to Alfonso, Count of Poitiers, the third surviving son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile. The marriage contract was however broken off and Alfonso instead married Joan, Countess of Toulouse.

Isabella was first married to Maurice IV, Sire of Craon. They were married until Maurice&#x27;s death in 1250. They had the following children:
# Amuary II (died 1269), successor to his father as Sire and married Yolande, daughter of John I, Count of Dreux but died without issue.
# Maurice V (died 11 February 1293), succeeded his brother as Sire, married Matilda of Berthout and had issue.
# Oliver (died 24 August 1285), Archbishop of Tours
# Margaret (died after 16 August 1280), married Renaud de Pressigny
# Jeanne (died before 1288), married Gerard II of Chabot and had a daughter named Isabella.

A charter dated October 1252 records a dispute with Isabella and her husband&#x27;s will.

Only one year after Maurice&#x27;s death, Isabella remarried Geoffrey de Rancon, a relative of a much older Geoffrey de Rancon. They had no children. Isabella was granted a payment by her half-brother King Henry III in 1254. After thirteen years of marriage Geoffrey died.

Isabella herself died on 14 January 1300 having most likely outlived all of her children. She had several grandchildren. Isabella also outlived all of her siblings (full and half).

<text>Temptress Moon is a 1996 Chinese film directed by Chen Kaige. It was jointly produced by the Shanghai Film Studio and the Taipei-based Tomson Films. The film saw Chen reuniting with Leslie Cheung and Gong Li who had previously worked with him in his breakout international hit &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;.

Ye Zhaoyan&#x27;s novel &quot;A Flower&#x27;s Shade&quot; was believed to be the basis for the film, although Ye was not credited in the film.

&quot;Temptress Moon&quot; premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or that eventually went to Mike Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;. Despite its international profile, the film was banned by state authorities in mainland China.

==Plot==
It is the day of the abdication of Emperor Puyi; the Pang clan, a wealthy family, is in decline. Zhongliang, a thirteen-year-old boy, arrives at the Pang estate to live with his sister Xiuyi and her husband Zhengda, a heavy opium user and the son of the family head. Ruyi, daughter of the head of the family, has been raised as an opium addict from birth and is consequently unable to be married off; she is running happily through the estate when Zhongliang arrives. Duanwu, a cousin with no prospects, longs to play with Ruyi. All three momentarily share a doorway. Zhongliang is treated like a servant, including being expected to prepare Zhengda&#x27;s nightly opium pipe; it is heavily implied that Zhengda sexually abuses Zhongliang by forcing him into having sex with Xiuyi. After six months of continued abuse, Zhongliang flees the estate.

Ten years later, Zhongliang has become a gigolo who seduces rich, married women for his boss Biggie in order to blackmail them. The scheme involves Zhongliang meeting a woman in a room and signaling his partners. His partners in crime storm the room, &quot;capture&quot; the couple by pulling black bags over their heads, and pretend to murder Zhongliang. The woman is then blackmailed to prevent exposure of the affair. Zhongliang&#x27;s success with the scam has made it highly lucrative, and Biggie treats Zhongliang like a son. Zhongliang has been seeing one particular target, &quot;the woman of Zephyr Lane&quot;, for weeks, and appears to have developed feelings for her; he lies to Biggie, telling him that her husband is out of town, and thus they cannot proceed with the blackmail against her.

At the Pang estate, Zhengda has been seriously ill for the past ten years; he is unable to move or speak. As a result, when her father dies, Ruyi is named the head of the family. The family elders refuse to let a woman fully control the fate of the family, since women are &quot;weak&quot;. Duanwu is outside the line of succession and cannot have any designs on leading the family himself, so they name him to assist Ruyi. However, when Ruyi uses her authority to expel her father&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s concubines, Duanwu supports her against the elders&#x27; wishes; infuriated, the elders beat Duanwu for his lack of manliness. Ruyi reasons that the concubines have been given the freedom that she longs for and will never have.

Interested in acquiring the Pang family&#x27;s money, Biggie sends Zhongliang back to the estate to seduce Ruyi. Zhongliang encounters his sister, whom he hates, but who claims that Zhongliang owes her for helping him to escape the estate ten years ago. Ruyi falls in love with Zhongliang, and seduces Duanwu in order to &quot;practice&quot; for Zhongliang, who claims he will take her with him when he leaves. Zhongliang, haunted by his past and unable to go through with the plan, abandons it at the last moment and returns to Shanghai alone. Ruyi is heartbroken, unable to speak of anything else, and Duanwu is beaten by the elders again for helping Ruyi plan to leave.

To atone for his failure, Zhongliang agrees to swindle the woman of Zephyr Lane. Biggie, sensing Zhongliang is wavering in his duties despite this show of loyalty, tricks Ruyi into coming to Shanghai. Ruyi is accompanied by Duanwu, and both are exposed to the modern world for the first time. Ruyi is taken to a room across the street from Zhongliang&#x27;s rendezvous where she witnesses Zhongliang&#x27;s scam through the window. Not caring about her husband, the woman of Zephyr Lane demands to know if Zhongliang ever loved her, a question Zhongliang doesn&#x27;t answer. The woman of Zephyr Lane throws herself off the balcony; Zhongliang is distraught by her death, and Biggie observes to his subordinates that Zhongliang is now permanently &quot;ruined&quot;. Ruyi comes to the dance hall and confronts Zhongliang, repeatedly asking if Zhongliang loved her or the woman of Zephyr Lane, but Zhongliang does not answer her. When Ruyi returns to the boarding room in Shanghai she shares with Duanwu, Duanwu rapes her.

Ruyi returns to the Pang estate and learns that her childhood betrothal, Jingyun, has returned. Jingyun informs Ruyi that their initial betrothal was ended by his family against his wishes. Zhongliang also returns to the estate; upon learning of Jingyun&#x27;s return, he desperately tries to win Ruyi back, but she informs him she no longer loves him and will soon be married to Jingyun. Zhongliang prepares her opium pipe that evening, just as he did years ago for Zhengda, and it is revealed that he poisoned Zhengda with arsenic; he poisons Ruyi&#x27;s pipe in the same manner, with his sister&#x27;s help, who knew that he had also poisoned her husband. Struck with remorse, Zhongliang attempts to stop Ruyi from taking the poison, but he arrives too late; the next morning, as he prepares to board a ship to leave, he is gunned down at the dock. Duanwu is proclaimed the new head of the Pang clan, while Ruyi is shown tied to a wheelchair, in the same state as her brother. A brief shot shows Zhongliang, Duanwu, and Ruyi as children, standing in the doorway on the night of the Emperor&#x27;s abdication.

==Production==
Despite its smaller-scale story, &quot;Temptress Moon&quot; proved far more difficult a production than its predecessor, Chen&#x27;s &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. Although filming began in 1994, &quot;Moon&quot; did not wrap until more than a year later in 1995; the film&#x27;s budget in the intervening time having ballooned to over $7 million (US), over twice as much as &quot;Concubine&quot;. Other problems arose as well, notably the firing of the original Ruyi, the Taiwanese actress Wang Ching-ying, about halfway through the shoot. The resulting delay lasted five months before filming resumed with Gong Li in the lead role.

==Reception==
Unlike the near universal praise for &quot;Concubine&quot;, &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;&#x27;s reception abroad was considerably more muted. Critics praised the sumptuous visuals by Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle, but also cited the confusing plot. Roger Ebert, in a typical review, noted &quot;&quot;Temptress Moon&quot; is a hard movie to follow--so hard, that at some point you may be tempted to abandon the effort and simply enjoy the elegant visuals...&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised the film&#x27;s sumptuous production values, but critic Stephen Holden also found the film to lack emotional weight, arguing that &quot;Temptress Moon&quot; ultimately &quot;has the feel of a chic, kink-ornamented romantic pageant, unfolding at a distance.&quot;

&quot;Temptress Moon&quot; holds a 62% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 13 critics.

<doc id="781322" wikidata="Q5255532" url="?curid=781322" title="Democrat Party (epithet)">
<text>Democrat Party is an epithet and pejorative for the Democratic Party of the United States, often used in a disparaging fashion by the party&#x27;s opponents. While use of the term started out as non-hostile, it has grown in its negative use since the 1940s, in particular by members of the Republican Party—in party platforms, partisan speeches, and press releases—as well as by conservative commentators and third party politicians.

==Modern usage==
United Press International reported in August 1984 that the term &quot;Democrat Party&quot; had been employed &quot;in recent years by some right-wing Republicans&quot; because the party&#x27;s &quot;Democratic&quot; name implied that the Democrats were &quot;the only true adherents of democracy&quot;.

Language expert Roy Copperud said it was used by Republicans who disliked the implication that &quot;Democratic Party&quot; implied to listeners that Democrats &quot;are somehow the anointed custodians of the concept of democracy&quot;. According to Oxford Dictionaries, the use of &quot;Democrat&quot; rather than the adjective &quot;Democratic&quot; &quot;is in keeping with a longstanding tradition among Republicans of dropping the &quot;–ic&quot; in order to maintain a distinction from the broader, positive associations of the adjective &quot;democratic&quot; with democracy and egalitarianism&quot;.

Political commentator William Safire wrote in 1993 that the &quot;Democrat&quot; of &quot;Democrat Party&quot; &quot;does conveniently rhyme with autocrat, plutocrat, and worst of all, bureaucrat&quot;. In 2006, Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

Republican pollster Frank Luntz tested the phrase with a focus group in 2001, and concluded that the only people who really disliked the epithet were highly partisan Democrats. Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed modern use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans. Journalist Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it, and Hertzberg calls use of the term &quot;a minor irritation&quot; and also &quot;the partisan equivalent of flashing a gang sign&quot;.

Nicole Holliday has described it as demonstrating affiliation, and said &quot;“Language is contagious, especially emotionally charged political language,&quot; ... “Most of the time, we don’t have the cognitive bandwidth to think very hard about every single word that we’re using. We just use it because it’s what other people do.&quot; Larry Glickma commented that lack of awareness &quot;shows how normalized it’s become&quot; comparing it to a &quot;schoolyard taunt&quot;.

==Grammar==
Among authors of dictionaries and usage guides who state that the use of &quot;Democrat&quot; as an adjective is ungrammatical are Roy H. Copperud, Bergen Evans, and William and Mary Morris. In particular, the latter have written: &quot;It is the idiotic creation of some of the least responsible members of the Republican Party.&quot;

In 2005, Ruth Walker, who has been the long-time language columnist for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, while stating that &quot;Democratic&quot; is the correct term in most instances, placed the adjectival use of &quot;Democrat&quot; within a broader trend: 

In 2012, the British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; stated: 

==History==

===19th century===

In American history, many parties were named by their opponents (Federalists, Loco-Focos, Know Nothings, Populists, Dixiecrats), including the Democrats themselves, as the Federalists in the 1790s used &quot;Democratic Party&quot; as a term of ridicule.

Addressing a gathering of Michigan Republicans in 1889, New Hampshire Republican Congressman Jacob H. Gallinger said:

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term was used by the press in London, England, as a synonym for the more common &quot;Democratic Party&quot; in 1890:Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America—yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.

===Early 20th century===
The 1919 &quot;New Teachers&#x27; and Pupils&#x27; Cyclopaedia&quot; entry for Woodrow Wilson states that &quot;In 1912, Wilson was the Democrat Party nominee for President ...&quot; On July 14, 1922, a newspaper in Keytesville, Missouri, posted an advertisement for its primary elections with the Democratic candidates identified as &quot;Representing: Democrat Party&quot;.

===Late 20th century===

The noun-as-adjective has been used by Republican leaders since the 1940s, and in most GOP national platforms since 1948 and began being popularized by Brazilla Carroll Reece in 1946. By the early 1950s, the term was in widespread use among Republicans of all factions. When Senator Thruston Ballard Morton became chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1959, he indicated that he had always said &quot;Democratic Party&quot; and would continue to do so, which contrasted with his predecessor, Meade Alcorn, and with National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman Barry Goldwater, both of whom used &quot;Democrat Party&quot;. According to &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;, at the 1968 Republican National Convention &quot;the GOP did revert to the epithet of &#x27;Democrat&#x27; party. The phrase had been used in 1952 and 1956 but not in 1960 and 1964&quot;.

According to William Safire, Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen, campaign manager to Republican Wendell Willkie during the 1940 presidential campaign, explained that because the Democratic Party was at that time partly controlled by undemocratic city bosses, &quot;by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a &#x27;Democratic Party.&#x27; It should be called the &#x27;Democrat Party.&#x27;&quot;

Columnist Russell Baker wrote in 1976: 

During the 1984 Republican National Convention, use of the term was a point of contention among the delegates. When a member of the Republican platform committee asked unanimous consent to change the phrasing of a platform amendment to read &quot;Democrat Party&quot; instead of &quot;Democratic Party&quot;, New York Representative Jack Kemp objected, saying that would be &quot;an insult to our Democratic friends;&quot; the committee dropped the proposal.

Newt Gingrich, in his efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to produce a Republican majority in the United States House of Representatives, relied heavily on words and phrases that cast Democrats in a negative light. The phrase &quot;Democrat Party&quot; gained new currency when the Republican Party, led by Gingrich, gained control of the House of Representatives in 1994.

In 1996, the wording throughout the Republican Party platform was changed from &quot;Democratic Party&quot; to &quot;Democrat Party&quot;: Republican leaders &quot;explained they wanted to make the subtle point that the Democratic Party had become elitist&quot;. A proposal to use the term in the August 2008 Republican platform for similar reasons was voted down, with leaders choosing to use &quot;Democratic Party&quot;. &quot;We probably should use what the actual name is,&quot; said Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, the panel&#x27;s chairman. &quot;At least in writing.&quot;

===21st century ===
Following his inauguration in 2001, President George W. Bush often used the noun-as-adjective when referring to the Democratic Party. Ruth Marcus, an opinion writer and columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote in 2006, &quot;The derisive use of &#x27;Democrat&#x27; in this way was a Bush staple during the recent campaign&quot;.

Bush spoke of the &quot;&quot; in his 2007 State of the Union Address, although the advance copy that was given to members of Congress read &quot;Democratic majority&quot;. Democrats complained about the use of &quot;Democrat&quot; as an adjective in the address; John Podesta, White House Chief of Staff under Bush&#x27;s predecessor Bill Clinton, said it was &quot;like nails on a chalkboard&quot;, although congressional historian Julian E. Zelizer has opined that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to disentangle whether that&#x27;s an intentional slight&quot;. Political analyst Charlie Cook doubted it was a deliberate attempt to offend Democrats, saying Republicans &quot;have been [using the term] so long that they probably don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re doing it&quot;.

Bush joked about the issue in a February 4, 2007 speech to House Democrats, stating &quot;Now look, my diction isn&#x27;t all that good. I have been accused of occasionally mangling the English language. And so I appreciate you inviting the head of the Republic Party.&quot;

Donald Trump has used the phrase repeatedly, both during his presidential campaign and as president. In a July 2018 campaign rally, he said that &quot;The Democratic Party sounds too good so I don&#x27;t want to use that, OK?&quot; He added, &quot;I call it the Democrat Party. It sounds better rhetorically.&quot; At a September 2018 rally he suggested that &quot;When you see &#x27;Democratic Party,&#x27; it&#x27;s wrong. There&#x27;s no name, &#x27;Democratic Party.&#x27;&quot; At the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019, he stated he liked to say, &quot;the &#x27;Democrat Party,&#x27; because it doesn&#x27;t sound good. But that&#x27;s all the more reason I use it, because it doesn&#x27;t.&quot; During the first White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference, he advanced this usage with, &quot;... governors including Democratic—or Democrat, as I call them—governors—which is actually the correct term.&quot;

During the 2020 United States presidential election, a conservative advocacy group created the website &quot;Democrat Voters Against Joe Biden&quot;, in an apparent attempt to respond to Republican Voters Against Trump. According to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, the former found only one registered Democrat for its testimonies by September 2020; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; opined that the name of the organization is a clue that its founders were unfamiliar with how registered Democrats refer to themselves. Deliberate usage of the term as an epithet accelerated in the late 2010s and 2020s.

===Media organizations===
According to the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America, the &quot;ungrammatical&quot; and &quot;partisan&quot; use of the phrase &quot;Democrat Party&quot; has &quot;echoed Republicans&quot; with its use in the Associated Press, &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

NPR directed its staff in 2010 to use the adjective &quot;Democratic&quot; rather than &quot;Democrat&quot;. According to Ron Elving, NPR&#x27;s senior Washington editor, it was the organization&#x27;s policy to call parties by the name that they use to refer to themselves, saying: &quot;We should not refer to Democrat ideas or Democrat votes. Any deviation from that by NPR reporters on air or online should be corrected&quot;.

==Responses==
In the mid-1950s, members of the Democratic National Committee proposed using &quot;Publican Party&quot; instead of &quot;Republican Party&quot;. The committee failed to accept the proposal, &quot;explaining that Republican is the name by which our opponents&#x27; product is known and mistrusted&quot;. Sherman Yellen suggested &quot;The Republicants&quot; as suitably comparable in terms of negative connotation in an April 29, 2007, &quot;Huffington Post&quot; column.

On the February 26, 2009 edition of &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, California Republican Representative Darrell Issa referred to &quot;a Democrat Congress&quot;. The host, Chris Matthews, responded by saying:

Issa denied that he intended to use &quot;fighting words&quot;, to which Matthews replied, &quot;They call themselves the Democratic Party. Let&#x27;s just call people what they call themselves and stop the Mickey Mouse here—save that for the stump.&quot;

In March 2009, after Representative Jeb Hensarling (R–Texas) repeatedly used the phrase &quot;Democrat Party&quot; when questioning U.S. Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag, Representative Marcy Kaptur (D–Ohio) said:

<text>Schöningen is a town of about 11,000 inhabitants in the district of Helmstedt, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==

The town is located on the southeastern rim of the Elm hill range, near the border with the state of Saxony-Anhalt. In its current form, it was created in 1974 by joining the municipalities of Esbeck, Hoiersdorf, and Schöningen.

Schöningen station was served by regional trains on the Wolfenbüttel–Helmstedt railway line until it was closed in 2007. The town is a stop on the scenic German Timber-Frame Road.

== History ==
In archaeology, Schöningen is famous for the Schöningen Spears, four ancient wooden spears found in the &quot;spear horizon&quot; in an opencast mine near the town (Bamford &amp; Henderson 2003). The spears are about 400,000 years old (Klein. 2005. p114), making them the world&#x27;s oldest human-made wooden artifacts, as well as the oldest weapons, ever found. Three of them were probably manufactured as projectile weapons, because the weight and tapered point is at the front of the spear making it fly straight in flight, similar to the design of a modern javelin. The fourth spear is shorter with points at both ends and is thought to be a thrusting spear or a throwing stick (Bamford &amp; Henderson 2003). They were found in combination with the remains of about 20 wild horses, whose bones contain numerous butchery marks, including one pelvis that still had a spear sticking out of it. This is considered proof that early humans were active hunters with specialized tool kits. The spears are currently on display at the &quot;paläon&quot; visitor centre, opened in 2013.

The 300.000 year-old nearly entire remains of a female straight-tusked elephant were revealed by University of Tübingen researchers and the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution in May in 2020. According to the archaeozoologist Ivo Verheijen, 6.8 tones older skeleton with battered teeth had a shoulder height of about 3.2 metres. Researchers also uncovered two long bones and 30 small flint flakes that were used as tools for knapping among the elephant bones.

The first historical mentioning of the Saxon settlement in the Royal Frankish Annals dates back to 747, when the Carolingian Mayor of the Palace Pepin the Short stayed at &quot;Scahaningi&quot; during the conflict with his half-brother Grifo. Schöningen was the site of a &quot;Königspfalz&quot; of Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne and later of the Ottonian dynasty. Saint Willigis, Archbishop of Mainz from 975, was probably born at Schöningen about 940. He served as archchancellor of Emperor Otto III who stayed here several times. Schöningen was the site of a Benedictine abbey founded in 983. Nearby Elm Castle, erected in the 11th century, was the seat of a commandry of the Teutonic Knights from 1221 onwards.

From the 14th century, it was held by the Welf dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who granted Schöningen town privileges in 1332. About 1350 Duke Magnus the Pious had Schöningen Castle built as a hunting lodge and also to secure the nearby border with the Bishopric of Halberstadt. It was damaged during the Schmalkaldic War in 1542, when Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel fought against the troops of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League. It later served as a widow&#x27;s seat of his consort Sophia Jagiellon, sister of the Polish king Sigismund II Augustus, and of her successors Elizabeth of Denmark and Anna Sophia, daughter of Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg. Duchess Elizabeth, sister of King Christian IV of Denmark had the palace rebuilt in a lavish Renaissance style from 1613 onwards. In 1640 Anna Sophia established a Latin school (&quot;Anna-Sophianeum&quot;) in Schöningen, which exists as a Gymnasium up to today.

Schöningen Castle was also the administrative seat of a Brunswick &quot;Amtmann&quot;. From 1679 it served as the residence of Anna Sophia, daughter of Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and spouse of Margrave Charles Gustav of Baden-Durlach. Her sister Elizabeth Eleonora married Duke Bernhard I of Saxe-Meiningen here. In 1733 Prince Frederick II of Prussia stayed here en route to his marriage with Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern at Salzdahlum. After the seat of the local administration was moved to Helmstedt in 1815, the castle decayed.

==Economy==
The main industry in Schöningen is open-cast mining of lignite, which is used for electricity generation in the Buschhaus Power Station. Both mining and generation are operated by E.ON subdivisions. Buschhaus power station and open-cast mining would be closed down in 2017. The Buschhaus plant now inhibits three lines of thermal waste treatment.

The Sachtleben Chemie company was founded as &quot;Lithopone- und Permanentweißfabrik&quot; at Schöningen in 1878; the production facilities were relocated to Duisburg in 1892.

Schöningen is the site of a ground station operated by the German Federal Intelligence Service (&quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot;) intelligence agency.

<text>The 2004 AFC Asian Cup was the 13th edition of the men&#x27;s AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). It was held from 17 July to 7 August 2004 in China. The defending champions Japan defeated China in the final in Beijing.

The tournament was marked by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s unexpected failure to even make it out of the first round; a surprisingly good performance by Bahrain, which finished in fourth place; Jordan, which reached the quarterfinals in its first appearance and Indonesia, which gained their historical first Asian Cup win against Qatar. The final match between China and Japan was marked by post-match rioting by Chinese fans near the north gate of Beijing Workers&#x27; Stadium, in part due to controversial officiating and anti-Japanese sentiment resulting from historical tensions.

==Venues==
==Qualification==
The lowest-ranked 20 teams were placed in 6 preliminary qualifying groups of 3 and one group of 2, with the group winners joining the remaining 21 teams in 7 groups of 4. The top two of each of these groups qualified for the finals in China.

==Tournament summary==
This competition saw a huge number of surprises. The first surprise named Bahrain was in group A, which, despite being just its second tournament, held on China and fellow neighbor Qatar before beating Indonesia 3–1, with the Hubail brothers Mohamed and Ala&#x27;a instrumental in bringing Bahrain to the quarter-finals. Host China, after a shock draw to Bahrain, easily progressed to the next round after thrashing Indonesia 5–0 before Xu Yunlong scored the decisive goal in China&#x27;s hard fought win over Qatar to process.

In group B, Jordan emerged as a second surprise, as the country just made its debut in the competition. Jordan surprised the whole tournament by two draws to the United Arab Emirates and, especially, a successful goalless draw to South Korea which had already finished in fourth place at the 2002 FIFA World Cup earlier, between that, Jordan shocked Kuwait with two late goals to seal a 2–0 victory, thus finishing second and progressed to the next round alongside South Korea, which, after being held by Jordan, decisively beat Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to progress.

The two other debutants were Turkmenistan and Oman in group C and D surprised by not finishing bottom in their group, though they failed to progress. Instead, it was the two experienced Saudi Arabia and Thailand which disappointed most of fans, finishing bottom after disastrous performances. In group C, Uzbekistan also surprised by topping the group with three straight 1–0 win while Japan and Iran were able to progress in group D after a final goalless draw and better result than Oman. Iraq was the other qualifier in group C, after beating both Turkmenistan and Saudi Arabia only by one goal margin.

The quarter-finals saw Jordan caused significant problem for Japan, and Jordan was thought to have almost qualified for the semi-finals in the penalty shootout. However, four straight misses later cost Jordan&#x27;s semi-final dream to end. Uzbekistan and Bahrain held on in a 2–2 draw and Bahrain prevailed after penalty shootout. Host China easily crushed Iraq 3–0, with Zheng Zhi scored two penalties to take Iraq home, while South Korea and Iran created the most phenomenon match in the tournament, an insane thriller where Iran prevailed 4–3 in what would be perceived as the greatest Asian Cup match in the history.

The first semi-final saw Iran and host China battling for the final, with both being held 1–1, despite Iran was down to ten men. China eventually won in penalty shootout. The other semi-final was another insane thriller between Bahrain and Japan, with the Japanese won after extra times thanked for a goal by Keiji Tamada in early minutes of the first half of extra times, thus sent Japan to the final against host China. Iran overcame Bahrain in a consolidating third place encounter, 4–2, to acquire bronze.

The final in Beijing saw China lose to Japan, with a controversial handball goal by Koji Nakata that sealed the game. The win meant Japan had successfully defended their title they achieved four years ago. The outcome frustrated many Chinese supporters, who ended up rioting outside Workers&#x27; Stadium over referee&#x27;s controversial decision allowing the handball goal of Koji Nakata.

==Controversies==
Like other sports events, the Asian Cup 2004 was publicised as evidence of China&#x27;s economic and athletic progress, being referred to by some as a prelude to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Many Chinese see the tournament as a success and take great pride in having showcased such an important sporting event in advance of the Olympic Games. However, the Japanese media and many other international observers have pointed out bad manners on the part of Chinese fans, and sparse attendance at the tournament, raising questions on China&#x27;s ability to hold such sporting events. 

There was also significant controversy over the refereeing of various matches in the tournament relating to the host China PR, specifically on China 3-0 Iraq and China 1-1 Iran. The match between China and Iraq featured a controversial penalty awarded to Zheng Zhi, while the two red cards awarded to Iran and the neglection of Zhang Yaokun&#x27;s deliberate violent conduct during the second half of the match was also questioned by authorities such as the head coach of Islamic Republic of Iran. 

Throughout the tournament, most Chinese fans in the stadia expressed anti-Japanese sentiments by drowning out the Japanese national anthem, displaying political banners and booing whenever Japan got the ball, regardless of the score or opponent. This was reported by the international media, and was aggravated when Koji Nakata apparently knocked in the ball with his right hand in the final. The PRC government responded by calling for restraint and increasing police numbers to maintain order. The Japanese government also called on the PRC to ensure the safety of Japanese fans, while specifically asking Japanese nationals or people of Japanese origin to not display any form of excessive pride. Despite the Chinese government&#x27;s campaign, a riot started by Chinese fans broke out near the north gate of the Workers&#x27; Stadium, though reports differ as to the extent of the riot. As a result, some media groups have said that displays of &quot;excessive Chinese nationalism during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics have become a cause for concern for Chinese officials&quot;.

<doc id="781345" wikidata="Q3619005" url="?curid=781345" title="Antonia Pantoja">
<text>Antonia Pantoja (September 13, 1922 – May 24, 2002), was a Puerto Rican educator, social worker, feminist, civil rights leader and the founder of &quot;ASPIRA&quot;, the Puerto Rican Forum, Boricua College and &quot;Producir&quot;. In 1996, she was the first Puerto Rican woman to receive the American Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early years==
Pantoja was born in Puerta de Tierra, in San Juan, Puerto Rico where she received her primary and secondary education. She was later able to study at the University of Puerto Rico with the financial help given to her by her wealthy neighbors. There she obtained a teacher&#x27;s certificate in 1942. In 1944 she moved to New York City, where she found a job as a welder in a wartime factory. She subsequently won a scholarship to Hunter College in Manhattan, where she graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in 1952. She then studied at Columbia University School of Social Work, where she earned her master&#x27;s degree in 1954. In 1973, she earned her Ph.D. from Union Graduate School (now Union Institute &amp; University) in Cincinnati, Ohio.

In 1957, Pantoja founded the Puerto Rican Forum (originally the Hispanic American Youth Association or HAYA), which served as an incubator for organizations and programs promoting economic self-sufficiency. This organization is now known as the National Puerto Rican Forum and its headquarters are in The Bronx.

==ASPIRA==
In 1961, Pantoja also founded &quot;ASPIRA&quot; (Spanish for &quot;aspire&quot;), a non-profit organization that promoted a positive self-image, commitment to community, and education as a value as part of the ASPIRA Process to Puerto Rican and other Latino youth in New York City. ASPIRA now has offices in six states, Puerto Rico and has its headquarters, the ASPIRA Association, in Washington, D.C.. It has provided approximately 50,000 Latino students with career and college counseling, financial aid and other assistance, and is today one of the largest nonprofit agencies in the Latino community. In 1963 Dr. Pantoja directed a project of the Puerto Rican Forum that resulted in the establishment of the Puerto Rican Community Development Project (PRCDP), funded by the federal War on Poverty.

==Reformation of New York&#x27;s educational system==
In 1964, Dr. Pantoja shifted her emphasis from self-help programs to the reformation of the educational system and in 1967 she served on a mayoral committee, convened by the then Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay, that recommended the decentralization of the school system.

In 1970, she established the &quot;Universidad Boricua&quot;, which is now known as Boricua College (with three campuses in NYC) and the Puerto Rican Research and Resources Center in Washington, D.C. In 1973, she earned her Ph.D. from Union Graduate School in Ohio. She joined the faculty of the San Diego State University&#x27;s School of Social Work in 1978, where she became the Director of the Undergraduate Program in Social Work. Later, she would become the co-founder of the Graduate School for Community Development, a private free-standing educational institution. This school taught community development, economic development and leadership skills to people in communities around the United States and Puerto Rico.

In 1972, ASPIRA of New York, under the direction of Dr. Mario Anglada and with the support of Dr. Pantoja, filed a civil rights lawsuit in the Federal court demanding that New York City provide classroom instruction in transitional Spanish for struggling Latino students. ASPIRA signed a consent decree with the NYC Board of Education in 1974, which is considered a major landmark in the history of bilingual education in the United States. Although Dr. Pantoja is credited with bringing this landmark lawsuit, she was actually no longer with ASPIRA at the time and was not directly involved.

==Awards and recognitions==
Among Pantoja&#x27;s numerous awards and recognitions are the following:

* Inducted into the Hunter College Hall of Fame
* The Hispanic Heritage Award
* The Julia de Burgos Award of la Casa Cultural of Yale University
* A Doctor of Letters Honorary degree from the University of Connecticut
* A Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Massachusetts Amherst
* A Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Puerto Rico
* The Hunter College Professional Achievement Award
* The Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York State Board of Regents

In 1996, President Bill Clinton presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the first Puerto Rican woman to receive such this honor.

In 2012, she was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.

In 2015, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.

==Later years==
After 1984, Pantoja moved to Puerto Rico for health reasons, where she established &quot;Producir&quot;, an organization which provides economic assistance to small businesses, and &quot;Provivienda&quot;, which works to develop housing for the needy. In 1998 she returned to New York, concluding that she was clearly now a Nuyorican, given her negative personal experiences in Puerto Rico.

In 2002, Pantoja published her autobiography, &quot;Memoir of a Visionary: Antonia Pantoja&quot;. In her memoirs she alluded to being a lesbian and discussed her decision not to go public before then with her sexual orientation.

Dr. Antonia Pantoja died of cancer in Manhattan, New York on May 24, 2002. She was survived by her longtime partner, Dr. Wilhelmina Perry. Filmmaker Lillian Jimenez of the Latino Educational Media Center in New York City worked on a documentary on the life of Dr. Pantoja.

Sometime around 2003-2004, a branch of the BPS (Buffalo Public Schools) system, PS 18, was renamed after Pantoja, in Buffalo, New York in 2003-2004.

<text>A desert planet, also known as a dry planet, an arid planet, or a dune planet, is a type of terrestrial planet with an arid surface consistency similar to Earth&#x27;s deserts. Mars is a prominent example of a desert planet in the Solar System.

== History ==
A 2011 study suggested that not only are life-sustaining desert planets possible, but that they might be more common than Earth-like planets. The study found that, when modeled, desert planets had a much larger habitable zone than ocean planets. The same study also speculated that Venus may have once been a habitable desert planet as recently as 1 billion years ago. It is also predicted that Earth will become a desert planet within a billion years due to the Sun&#x27;s increasing luminosity. 

A study conducted in 2013 concluded that hot desert planets without runaway greenhouse effect can exist in 0.5 AU around Sun-like stars. In that study, it was concluded that a minimum humidity of 1% is needed to wash off carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but too much water can act as a greenhouse gas itself. Higher atmospheric pressures increase the range in which the water can remain liquid.

== Science fiction == 

The concept has become a common setting in science fiction, appearing as early as the 1956 film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;. The environment of the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) in the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise drew inspiration from the Middle East, particularly the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf, as well as Mexico. &quot;Dune&quot; in turn inspired the desert planets which prominently appear in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, including the planets Tatooine, Geonosis, and Jakku.

<text>Josef Václav Myslbek (20 June 1848 – 2 June 1922) was a Czech sculptor and medalist credited with founding the modern Czech sculpting style.

==Life==
Josef grew up poor in a suburb of Prague. His family pushed him to become a shoemaker but he shirked the duty by getting a job with a succession of Czech sculptors. There was no school program for sculpting so he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague instead. Afterwards he opened his own sculpting studio. He became greatly inspired by the French sculpting style as well as related arts such as photography and literature. Josef Václav Myslbek influenced an entire generation of Czech sculptors and his students include Stanislav Sucharda, Jan Štursa and Bohumil Kafka. Myslbek is buried in Prague&#x27;s National Cemetery.

==Works==

Myslbek&#x27;s most famous work is the Statue of Saint Wenceslas, which is located in the center of Wenceslas Square. It took him over 20 years to complete but has since become one of Prague&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks and a symbol of Czech statehood.

In 1871, Myslbek produced some of his greater works including a commission to do a set of statues for the National Theater. Later he would do busts and monuments of several famous Czechs such as Bedřich Smetana and František Palacký.

His four pairs of statues for the Palacký Bridge have been relocated to the Vyšehrad:
*&quot;Libuše and Přemysl&quot;, depicts Přemysl, the Ploughman and Libuše
*&quot;Lumír and Píseň &quot;, depicts Lumír (a legendary bard) and Píseň (&quot;song&quot;)
*&quot;Záboj and Slavoj&quot;, heroic brothers from the &quot;Rukopis královédvorský&quot;
*&quot;Ctirad and Šárka&quot;, characters from &quot;The Maidens&#x27; War&quot;, a traditional Bohemian tale

<text>The New South Wales Waratahs ( or ;), referred to as the Waratahs, are an Australian professional rugby union team representing the majority of New South Wales in the Super Rugby competition.

The Waratahs play their home games at the new Allianz Stadium in Sydney.

== History ==

=== Amateur era ===

The NSWRU (or then, The Southern RU – SRU) was established in 1874, and the very first club competition took place that year. By 1880 the SRU had over 100 clubs in its governance in the metropolitan area. In 1882 the first New South Wales team was selected to play Queensland in a two-match series. NSW would go on to win both the games. That same year the first NSW touring squad was selected to go and play in New Zealand.
In 1907, several of the New South Wales rugby union team&#x27;s players defected. They included the &quot;superstar&quot;, Dally Messenger. These players joined the New South Wales rugby league team against a visiting rebel New Zealand rugby team. This was essentially the birth of rugby league in Australia.

During World War I, the NSW (and QLD) Rugby Unions ceased senior competition. The Queensland body however would not reform until 1929, which saw NSW have more responsibilities for Australian rugby. In 1921 the Waratahs toured New Zealand again, and out of their 10 fixtures, won nine games, including the Test.

The most famous Waratah team was the 1927/28 Waratahs who toured the United Kingdom, France and North America, introducing a style of open, running rugby never seen before, but which has been the stamp of the Australian game ever since. They won 24 and drew two of their 31 official matches. Seven members of this 1927/8 side were from the Drummoyne Rugby Club. Upon returning home, were greeted with a parade through Sydney and a reception at Town Hall. It was also around this time that they formally adopted the Waratahs name. Matches against Queensland would soon resume also.

The 1930s were a particularly successful time for NSW. The height of the success of NSW is best represented by the defeat of the South African Springboks in 1937 at the SCG. NSW Rugby Union would also perform strongly throughout the following decades as well, which included the emergence of footballers such as Trevor Allan, David Brockhoff, Tony Miller, Nick Shehadie, Eddie Stapleton, Ken Catchpole, John Thornett, Peter Crittle and Ron Graham.

In 1963, the Sydney Rugby Union was established for the growth of the game in the city area. The NSW Rugby Union would celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1974. As part of the anniversary celebrations, a match was played at the SCG on 18 May against the All Blacks, though the Waratahs lost nil to 20.

=== Professional era ===

=== Super 12: 1996–2005 ===

In their inaugural Super 12 season of 1996, the Waratahs won just under half of their games, finishing mid table, with the two other Australian teams finishing above them. The following season of 1997 saw the Waratahs end in a 9th place, winning four fixtures.

In the 1998 season the Waratahs won a best six out of 11 games, ending up in 6th position on the ladder at the end of the season, despite obvious improvements the team had still yet to make a finals appearance. The Waratahs won four fixtures the next season. They won five games in the 2000 season and the &#x27;Tahs finished their season in 9th place.

In 2001 after replicating their 2000 performance, the Waratahs were still out of reach of finals contention, in 8th position. 2002 was a record breaking season for the Waratahs, as the team won eight out of their 11-season games and finished in second place behind the Crusaders – making the semis. However, in the final game of the regular season the Waratahs lost 96–19 (a Super Rugby record). They were defeated by their Australian rivals the Brumbies, 51–10, in the Waratahs&#x27; first ever semi-final. The combined score over the two weeks was Brumbies/Crusaders 147 v. Waratahs 29.

In the 2003 season the Waratahs missed a place in the finals, finishing in 6th position on the ladder at the end of the regular season. In 2004 the Waratahs made a promising start to their season with three straight wins. The team finished 8th on the Super 12 table, six points out of the finals. That year coach Ewen McKenzie re-introduced the end of season tour, taking place in Argentina that year. In 2005, they had their best regular season, finishing second in the table, before losing to the Crusaders in the 2005 Super 12 Final.

=== Super 14: 2006–2010 ===
The Waratahs finished 3rd on the regular season table for the 2006 Super 14 season, in which two new teams entered the expanding tournament, the Force and Cheetahs. In the last home match of the regular season, the Waratahs hosted the Hurricanes, which they lost 14 to 29. The news that star league recruit Wendell Sailor had tested positive to an illegal substance and thus faced a career ending ban from the game was an unwelcome intrusion on the Waratahs semifinal build up. The following week, the semi-finals, they again faced the Hurricanes, though away in Wellington. The Waratahs made their exit, losing 16 to 14. Wendell Sailor later received a two-year ban from the game, marring a season that had promised so much.

The 2007 Super 14 season was the most disappointing for the team and its supporters with the Waratahs winning only three games, against the lions, the wooden spoon winning Reds, and the Hurricanes in the final round gaining a final placing of 13th out of 14. Despite the poor performance the 2007 season saw the emergence of teenage rugby prodigy Kurtley Beale and proved to be a vital rebuilding stage in the Waratahs super 14 championship run.

The 2008 season began well for the NSW Waratahs, with solid pre-season wins and a solid opening game victory against the Hurricanes 20–3. The &#x27;Tahs secured their 500th win since their formation in their Fourth round match against the . After starting the season in a slow but solid manner the &#x27;Tahs began to play their best rugby in their mid season match with the Blues, scoring their first four try bonus point of the season. The Waratahs then continued on a roll finishing their home season with another impressive 4 try bonus point win against title front runners the Sharks, advancing to second place on the ladder. An average South African trip saw the team slip to third on the ladder after only notching up 3 competition points, due to a loss to the (7 or less BP) and a satisfactory draw against other title contenders the Stormers. The Waratahs faced the Reds in the final round with a win securing second place, combined with a home semi-final win over the Sharks, moved them up to their first Super 14 final against the Crusaders, which they later lost 12–20.

In the last two seasons of the Super14 format, the Waratahs failed to make the final on both occasions after narrowly missing the finals (on points difference) in 2009 and qualifying for the semi-final in 2010. They finished 5th and 3rd in respective years, losing to the in the semi-final of the 2010 season.

=== Super Rugby: 2011–present ===

In the 2011 season, the Waratahs again failed to reach the final. On this occasion, their season ended when they were eliminated by the in the qualifying final after finishing 5th in the overall standings in the revamped competition. The following two seasons were very bleak by comparison. Coach Chris Hickey parted ways with the club at the end of the season with Michael Foley taking over the reins for 2012. The Waratahs finished well outside finals contention in 2012 in 11th place. This brought about another change in the coaching department with Michael Cheika for 2013. His impact was not immediate as the Waratahs failed to make the finals for a second consecutive season finishing 9th overall.

==== Championship season 2014 ====
The 2014 season of the super rugby competition was undoubtedly the Waratahs greatest season so far. The Waratahs not only overcame the Curse of the Tahs, a commonly held superstition, but they were also able to post the greatest super rugby season yet. The second season under coach Michael Cheika saw a new expansive style of rugby implemented which gave birth to exciting running rugby, bringing dwindling crowds back in force with home games averaging at around 19,152 people in attendance.

The running intent of Michael Cheika was quickly revealed after the team saw two fly halves announced in the starting game against Western Force. The Waratahs opening match not only saw Kurtley Beale&#x27;s return, scoring one try and having a hand in several others, but it was also a showcase to reveal the Tahs new weapon; Israel Folau. Folau highlighted Cheika&#x27;s intent scoring a hat-trick of tries in what was soon to be a season of all-out attack by the Waratahs. Not only did the Waratahs score the most points in the opening match out of any team with a 43–21 score, but they also had the second largest winning margin of 22 points.

The Waratahs went on to win the Australian conference with 13 more points than the team that came in at second place, the Brumbies, and came in as the number one team 7 points ahead of the competition. The Waratahs were in the driver&#x27;s seat advancing straight through to the semi-finals; the club&#x27;s 8th semi-final appearance. After the Brumbies defeated the Chiefs 32–30, the Brumbies advanced to compete against the Waratahs. The Waratahs displayed a show of force in their performance against an in-form Brumbies team, decimating them 26-8 granting the Waratahs a home final. The final, held at Stadium Australia, was host to 61,823 spectators. With two tries a piece, six penalties each, and the Crusaders up 32–30, only one conversion made the difference. The turning point in the game was a penalty at the 79th minute by the famous New Zealand flanker, Richie McCaw 45 metres out. Bernard Foley&#x27;s penalty 45m out right in front of the post gave the Waratahs&#x27; a lead 33–32. The Waratahs had finally won a Super Rugby Championship.

==Logo and colours==
The &quot;Waratahs&quot; name has historically been the name for the New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU) representative team, and became the name for the New South Wales team when it entered the Super Six, Super 10 and Super 12 competitions. The name and emblem comes from the waratah, the state flower for New South Wales.

The New South Wales Waratahs commonly play in a Cambridge Blue jersey and navy blue shorts, blue having a long sporting association with the state and a famous rivalry with the red/maroon colour of Queensland. Longtime sponsors HSBC feature on the front of the jersey. The Waratahs wore the HSBC logo for the final time when they played Argentina in August 2013.

The 2014 season saw Volvo as the Waratahs new major sponsor, after a number of years being minor sponsors with &#x27;sleeve presence&#x27; on the previous jersey. An alternative white strip is also used. In pre-season of 2006, the Waratahs donned a New Jersey scheme in a trial game against the Crusaders. This system saw traditional rugby playing numbers on the back of jerseys replaced with the initials of the player. The current jersey is made by ISC and is Cambridge blue with navy side panels, collar and cuffs, with the alternate strip being white with five Cambridge blue hoops, collar and cuffs.

Until 1885, New South Wales wore &#x27;heather green&#x27; strips. From 1891 to 1897, New South Wales played in scarlet jerseys. The following season, the team adopted Cambridge blue jerseys. The light blue jersey and navy blue pants were established in 1897 and have been in effect ever since.

==Sponsorship==
In Super Rugby the Waratahs have featured the following sponsors:


==Stadium==
 
Until 2019, the Waratahs played at the old Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in Sydney&#x27;s Moore Park. The capacity for the stadium was 45,500. The Waratahs shared the ground with Sydney FC and the Sydney Roosters.

In 2009, the Waratahs signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Stadium Australia which saw them play at least one game per season at the Sydney Olympic Park stadium until 2015.

As well as the SFS, the Waratahs have on occasion played fixtures at other stadiums throughout the state. During the Australian Provincial Championship, in which the Waratahs had two fixtures, the games were taken to the Central Coast Stadium in Gosford, and the other to Bathurst. The Waratahs also played trial matches at Campbelltown Stadium in 2008 and 2015. During the 2018 Super Rugby season, the Waratahs played one home game at Brookvale Oval and one at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

With the SFS closed for demolition and rebuilding as the Sydney Football Stadium (2022) from 2019 to 2022 home games were split between the new CommBank Stadium, the Sydney Cricket Ground, Brookvale Oval and even outside of Sydney at Hunter Stadium in Newcastle.

== Team song ==
At the end of every winning game, the Waratahs sing the following song:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;We are the mighty Waratahs 
Rough and tumble rugby stars 
We play the game as it should be played

Famous when we run the ball 
We can scrum and ruck and maul 
Playing the game as it should be played

Waratahs, Waratahs 
We play the game as it should be played 
Famous when we run the ball 
We can scrum and ruck and maul 
Playing the game as it should be played

We are the mighty men in blue 
We will take the game to you 
We play the game as it should be played

We&#x27;ve got talent 
We&#x27;ve got heart 
We will tear your team apart 
Playing the game as it should be played

Waratahs, Waratahs 
We play the game as it should be played 
We&#x27;ve got talent 
We&#x27;ve got heart 
We will tear your team apart 
Playing the game as it should be played&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Development teams==
The New South Wales Waratahs own and manages two National Rugby Championship teams, the Sydney Rays and NSW Country Eagles. These NRC teams draw on a range of players ranging from full-time professionals to those on incentive contracts. These teams are closely aligned with the Waratahs and are based at Moore Park, the training venue used by the Waratahs.

Outside of the NRC season, many of these players are retained in the Gen Blue (NSW A) team, which is the Waratahs elite development squad just below full-time professional level. The Sydney Rays and NSW Country Eagles also field Under 19 teams.

===Gen Blue (NSW A)===
The Gen Blue team plays matches against interstate and international representative teams, and has also competed in tournaments such as the Pacific Rugby Cup. Known by various names over the years including NSW A, Waratahs A, Gen Blue, and Junior Waratahs, the team is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in New South Wales. The squad is composed of Waratahs contracted players, extended training squad members, New South Wales Under 19s, and selected Shute Shield club players.

===Under 19===
Two New South Wales teams, Sydney Rays U19 and NSW Country Eagles U19, play in the national URC competition. Prior to 2008, state colts teams at under 21 and under 19 age levels were fielded in national tournaments and competitions such as the Trans-Tasman Trophy. These colts teams were consolidated as under 20s ahead of the inaugural World Rugby U20 Championship. In 2018, an under 19 age limit was reinstated for the national colts team competition.

<doc id="781460" wikidata="Q725974" url="?curid=781460" title="Ashley Montagu">
<text>Montague Francis Ashley-Montagu (born Israel Ehrenberg; June 28, 1905November 26, 1999) was a British-American anthropologist who popularized the study of topics such as race and gender and their relation to politics and development. He was the rapporteur, in 1950, for the UNESCO &quot;statement on race&quot;.

As a young man he changed his name from Ehrenberg to &quot;Montague Francis Ashley-Montagu&quot;. After relocating to the United States he used the name &quot;Ashley Montagu&quot;.

Montagu, who became a naturalized American citizen in 1940, taught and lectured at Harvard, Princeton, Rutgers, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and New York University. Forced out of his Rutgers position after the McCarthy hearings, he repositioned himself as a public intellectual in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing regularly on television shows and writing for magazines and newspapers. He authored over 60 books throughout this lifetime. In 1995, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year.

==Early life and education==
Montagu was born Israel Ehrenberg on June 28, 1905, in London, England. He grew up in London&#x27;s East End. He remembered often being subjected to antisemitic abuse when he ventured out of his own Jewish neighborhood. Montagu attended the Central Foundation Boys&#x27; School. He developed an interest in anatomy very early and as a boy was befriended by Scottish anatomist and anthropologist Arthur Keith under whom he studied informally.

In 1922, at the age of 17, he entered University College London, where he received a diploma in psychology after studying with Karl Pearson and Charles Spearman and taking anthropology courses with Grafton Elliot Smith and Charles Gabriel Seligman. He also studied at the London School of Economics, where he became one of the first students of Bronisław Malinowski. In 1931, he emigrated to the United States. At this time, he wrote a letter introducing himself to Harvard anthropologist Earnest Hooton, claiming to have been &quot;educated at Cambridge, Oxford, London, Florence, and Columbia&quot; and to have earned M.A. and PhD degrees. In reality, Montagu had not graduated from Cambridge or Oxford and did not yet have a PhD. He taught anatomy to dental students in the United States, and received his doctorate in 1936, when he produced a dissertation at Columbia University, &quot;Coming into being among the Australian Aborigines: A study of the procreative beliefs of the native tribes of Australia&quot; which was supervised by cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict. He became a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University, working there from 1949 until 1955.

==Career==
During the 1940s and 1950s, Montagu published a series of works questioning the validity of race as a biological concept, including the UNESCO &quot;Statement on Race&quot;, and his very well known &quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth: the Fallacy of Race&quot;. He was particularly opposed to the work of Carleton S. Coon, and the term &quot;race&quot;. In 1952, together with William Vogt, he gave the first Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture, inaugurating the series.

Montagu wrote the Foreword and Bibliography of the 1955 edition of &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot; by Petr Kropotkin, which was reprinted in 2005.

Due to disputes concerning his involvement with the UNESCO &quot;Statement on Race&quot;, Montagu became a target for anti-communists, and, lacking tenure, was dismissed from Rutgers University and &quot;found all other academic avenues blocked.&quot; He retired from his academic career in 1955 and moved to Princeton, New Jersey to continue his popular writing and public appearances. He became a well-known guest of Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. He addressed his numerous published studies of the significant relationship of mother and infant to the general public. The humanizing effects of touch informed the studies of isolation-reared monkeys and adult pathological violence that is the subject of his Time-Life documentary &quot;Rock A Bye Baby&quot; (1970). Also in 1970, Montagu resided at the North Shore Inn, which was the last year of the inn&#x27;s operation before it was razed that fall. The North Shore Inn was located on the grounds of the world-famous Chautauqua Institution, in Chautauqua County, NY. The institute is renowned as a gathering place for philosophy, anthropology, opera, and the arts. Thomas Edison had a summer home there as well.

Later in life, Montagu actively opposed genital modification and mutilation of children. In 1994, James Prescott wrote the &quot;Ashley Montagu Resolution to End the Genital Mutilation of Children Worldwide: a Petition to the World Court, The Hague&quot;, named in honor of Montagu, who was one of its original signers.

Montagu was a noted critic of creationism. He edited Science and Creationism, a volume of essays by several writers, including Isaac Asimov, which refuted creationist arguments. Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Science and Creationism&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #75, and stated that it &quot;reveals just how intellectually poverty-stricken the creationist movement is. Academic bloodshed on a vast scale: I loved it.&quot;

A posthumous biography of Montagu, &quot;Love Forms the Bones&quot;, was written by anthropologist Susan Sperling and published in 2005.

== Work ==
=== &quot;Statement on Race&quot; ===
Montagu was one of the ten scientists invited to serve on a UNESCO committee addressing race, later known as the Committee of Experts on Race Problems. The main purpose of the organization was to contribute to world peace and security through science and culture. The group wrote a series of &quot;Statements on Race&quot; to spread awareness that humans are all one species and that &quot;race&quot; is not a valid biological concept. Montagu co-authored these Statements and later published a book, &quot;Statement on Race&quot;, presenting his own views on the theme in much more detail.

The first UNESCO Statement says, &quot;Scientists have reached general agreement in recognizing that mankind is one: that all men belong to the same species, Homo sapiens.&quot; The first statement was put in such a way that laymen would be able to understand a scientist&#x27;s point of view. They worded it so that people who were not knowledgeable about the subject would understand. &quot;Homo sapiens is made up of a number of populations, each one of which differs from the others.&quot; That states that even though there is variability in the individual&#x27;s genetic heritage, all belong to a discrete species and should be treated equally.

The second Statement says that since human history is widely diverse and complex, there are many human populations that cannot be easily classified &quot;racially&quot;. However, some anthropologists believe that mankind is classified into at least three major human races. Even though it is believed that there are many human races, it gives no support that there is one race that is superior or inferior to any of the other races.

The third Statement gives views on the biological aspect of the race question. It explains that different human groups diverged from a common stock and that is the reason for their biological differences. The third statement also goes into detail about human evolution and how important it is for H. sapiens to survive and grow.

The fourth Statement says, &quot;All men are born free and equal both in dignity and in rights.&quot; The fourth statement says that racism stultifies development and threatens world peace. &quot;The division of human species into &#x27;races&#x27; is partly conventional and partly arbitrary and does not imply any hierarchy whatsoever.&quot;

=== &quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race&quot; ===
One of his works, &quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth&quot;, was written in 1942, when race was considered the determinant of people&#x27;s character and intelligence. Montagu presented a unique theory for his time: &quot;in biology race is defined as a subdivision of species which inherits physical characteristics distinguishing it from other populations of the species. In this sense there are many human &#x27;races.&#x27; But this is not the sense in which many anthropologists, race-classifiers, and racists have used the term.&quot; He admits that in a biological sense, there is the existence of races within mankind. However, he also believes that not all of mankind can be classified. Part of his reasoning has to do with mixed origin, which has resulted in &quot;overlapping&quot; of physicalities. Instead of races and subspecies, he prefers the notion of mixed ethnic groups. His writing further emphasizes the complexity of our descent and rejects claims that support one race being superior when compared to others.

He says this idea or concept of race originated around the 18th century. The concept developing as a direct result of slavery and the slave trade. As a side effect of slavery, naturally, humanity has divided racially; this has carried and proceeded to dominate culture. The physical difference furthered the establishment of races and evident differences between individuals. He mentions Darwin and other forefathers who touched on this topic when they attempted to explain race to all. He touches on society, genetics, psychological, culture, war, democracy, eugenics, and social factors as contributors that enhance this idea of race.

&quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth&quot; was revised into new editions six times by Montagu, the last in 1997 when he was 92 years old, and is still in print over 75 years after its initial publication.

=== &quot;The Natural Superiority of Women&quot; ===
Originally produced as a magazine article, &quot;The Natural Superiority of Women&quot;, published in 1952, was one of the major documents of second-wave feminism and the only one written by a man. Using his background as a physical anthropologist, Montagu points to the biological advantages that the women of the human species have for long-term survival. The book was revised five times, the last edition published shortly before his death in 1999 and still in print.

=== &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; ===
Possibly one of Montagu&#x27;s least significant works was the most famous one. His biography of a deformed 19th century British man, Joseph Merrick, dubbed The Elephant Man, was published in 1971 and formed the basis of the 1980 movie directed by David Lynch.

==Personal life==
Montagu married Marjorie Peakes in 1931; the couple had two daughters and one son. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on November 26, 1999.

==Legacy==
In 2008, Australia&#x27;s University of Sydney appointed Dr Stephen Juan as &quot;Ashley Montagu Fellow for the Public Understanding of Human Sciences&quot;, a position created especially for Juan (who died in 2018).

==In popular culture==
* Montagu is the writer and director of the film &quot;One World or None&quot;. Produced in 1946 by The National Committee on Atomic Information, this short documentary exposes the dangers of nuclear weapons and argues that only international cooperation and proper control of atomic energy can avoid war and guarantee the use of this force for the benefit of mankind.
* Footage of Ashley Montagu talking with Charlton Heston about his character in the movie appears as a bonus in the special DVD edition of &quot;The Omega Man&quot;.
*Archive footage of him, among others (including Carl Sagan), is featured in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Gethsemane.&quot;
*The saying &quot;International law exists only in textbooks on international law,&quot; which is often attributed to Albert Einstein, was in fact said &quot;to&quot; Einstein by Montagu.
