<text>Korean martial arts ( or ) are fighting practices and methods which have their place in the history of Korea but have been adapted for use by both military and non-military personnel as a method of personal growth or recreation. The history of Korean martial arts can be traced as far back as the prehistoric era.

Notable examples of unarmed martial arts include taekwondo, hapkido, ssireum, and taekkyon. For armed martial arts, Korean archery, Kumdo, Korean swordsmanship, and knife fighting exist. In November 2011, taekkyon was placed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.

==History==

===Early history===

Wrestling, called ssireum, is the oldest form of ground fighting in Korea, while Subak was the upright martial art of foot soldiers. Weapons were an extension of those unarmed skills. Besides being used to train soldiers, both of these traditional martial arts were also popular among villagers during festivals for dance, mask, acrobatic, and sport fighting. These martial arts were also considered basic physical education. However, Koreans relied more heavily on bows and arrows in warfare than they did on close-range weapons.

It appears that during the Goguryeo dynasty, (37 BC – 668) subak/taekkeyon or ssireum (empty-handed fighting), swordsmanship, spear-fighting and horse riding were practiced. In 1935, paintings that showed martial arts were found on the walls of royal tombs believed to have been built for Goguryeo kings sometime between the years 3 and 427 AD. Which techniques were practiced during that period is, however, something that cannot be determined from these paintings. References to Subak can be found in government records from the Goguryeo dynasty through the Joseon dynasty, until the 15th century, after which its popularity declined It reappears only in 1790 book about martial arts titled &quot;Muyedobotongji&quot; ().

===Joseon===
In 1593, during the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions of Korea, Korea received help from China to win back Pyongyang. During one of the battles, the Koreans learned about a martial art manual titled &quot;Ji Xiao Xin Shu&quot; (), written by the Chinese military strategist Qi Jiguang. King Seonjo (1567–1608) took a personal interest in the book, and ordered his court to study the book. This led to the creation of the &quot;Muyejebo&quot; () in 1599 by Han Gyo, who had studied the use of several weapons with the Chinese army. Soon this book was revised in the Muyejebo Seokjib and in 1759, the book was revised and published at the &quot;Muyesinbo&quot; ().
In 1895, Emperor Gojong invited 40 sword masters from Japan to begin teaching the art of the sword to his Korean Army cadets and police officers. This was decided upon due to the lack of native sword masters in Korea at the time. Teachings continued well after the 1910 Annexation, until the art was formally named Kendo in Japan, and Kumdo in Korean.

In 1899, Emperor Gojong, with the encouragement of the visiting Prince Heinrich of Prussia, established gungdo as an official sport.

During the Donghak Rebellion, much of the rebels used old matchlock arquebuses against the modern rifles of the Korean and Japanese Army. Although the rebels initially fought against the Korean government, following the fall of Jeonju, the Korean government had invited in the Japanese Army to help suppress the peasant rebels. With the annexation of Korea in 1910, all matchlocks were confiscated and destroyed by the Japanese. However, the Japanese did not stop the production and keeping of bows, which they did not consider as a threat to internal security. 

===Modern Korean martial arts===
The two extant martial arts at the time of Japanese take over in 1910, ssireum and gungdo grew in popularity during the Japanese occupation period, both of them founding their current federations in 1920. Taekkyon did not enjoy much popularity during the occupation era.

Currently these new arts such as taekwondo and hapkido created since 1945 remain the most popular in Korea. Other modern styles such as Tae Soo Do and Hwa Rang Do, which have a sizeable presence in the US and Europe, are almost unknown in Korea, as the founders relocated to the US and focused on operations in the US. Gungdo participation is limited by the high cost of the equipment, with a traditional horn made reflex bow costing upwards of $1000, and most gungdo clubs in Seoul charging over $1000 application fee for membership, similar to golf clubs. This limits participation to the upper and upper middle class. Many Korean junior high schools, high schools, and colleges maintain martial arts teams to include ssireum, kumdo (kendo), judo and taekwondo. Yong In University for instance, focuses on martial arts training for international competitions.

==Types of Korean martial arts==
===Taekwondo===
Taekwondo is a Korean martial art which emerged in the mid-twentieth century, and has subsequently become one of the most widely practiced martial arts in the world. The art is characterized by powerful hand strikes and kicks, which are used for unarmed self-defense or combat, or in organized sport competitions such as the Olympic Games. Taekwondo primarily focuses on fast, powerful, kicking and punching techniques, which are blended with sophisticated footwork, jumps, blocks, and avoiding actions. In recent years, some Taekwondo styles have begun to incorporate a limited number of joint locks, throws, and ground defenses into their curricula, to keep pace with the needs of modern society and the reality of contemporary self-defense. It has been estimated that there are more than 50 million Taekwondo practitioners worldwide. Since 1988, Taekwondo has been included in the Olympic Games, which has contributed to its phenomenal growth and popularity. 

Taekwondo is the national sport of both Koreas and possibly the most recognized of the Korean martial arts.

===Taekkyon/Taekkyeon===
Taekkyon is acknowledged as one of the oldest martial arts of Korea. Song Deok-gi was the last Taekkyon Master of the Joseon dynasty.

On June 1, 1983, Taekkyon was made the Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea No. 76 by the South Korean government. It is one of two Korean martial arts which possesses such a classification. In November 2011, Taekkyon was recognized on the UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible World Heritage Art list.

===Subak===

Subak is an ancient Korean martial art.

===Tang Soo Do/Soo Bahk Do===

Tang Soo Do is a striking martial art, which was developed during the 20th century, yet it has its roots in ancient Korean martial arts, as well as martial arts from other nations.

===Hapkido===
Hapkido is a Korean martial art which emerged in the mid-twentieth century and quickly grew to become an international style. Its founders created the art by selectively fusing a wide range of existing martial skills, with new innovations. As a result, Hapkido possesses one of the most complex, unique, and varied arsenals of self-defense techniques to be found in any martial art. These skills encompass all major martial categories: strikes, kicks, blocks, avoiding movements, holds, joint locks, chokes, throws, breakfalls, tumbling, ground fighting, weapons, meditation, and healing. Although Hapkido is often compared to Aikido, Taekwondo, Jujutsu, Judo, and Tai Chi Chuan, it has a much broader range of techniques, suitable in a wider range of situations. 
===Hanmudo===
Hanmudo (한무도) is a hybrid Korean martial art developed by Dr He-Young Kimm. He founded the World Hanmudo Association in 1989.

===Gungdo===

The reflex bow had been the most important weapon in Korean wars with Chinese dynasties and nomadic peoples, recorded from the 1st century BCE. Legend says the first king and founder of the Goguryeo, Go Jumong, was a master of archery, able to catch 5 flies with one arrow. Park Hyeokgeose, the first king of the Silla, was also said to be a skilled archer.

Until the Imjin wars, the tactical superiority of the matchlock arquebus became apparent, despite its slow rate of fire and susceptibility to wet weather. However, it was the Korean composite bow, referred to as the &quot;half bow&quot; by the Japanese, that halted the Japanese at the Battle of Haengju as well as at the Battle of Ulsan.

<doc id="792694" wikidata="Q776167" url="?curid=792694" title="Rebranding">
<text>Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, concept or combination thereof is created for an established brand with the intention of developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders. Often, this involves radical changes to a brand&#x27;s logo, name, legal names, image, marketing strategy, and advertising themes. Such changes typically aim to reposition the brand/company, occasionally to distance itself from negative connotations of the previous branding, or to move the brand upmarket; they may also communicate a new message a new board of directors wishes to communicate.

Rebranding can be applied to new products, mature products, or even products still in development. The process can occur through a change in marketing strategy or in various other situations such as Chapter 11 corporate restructuring, union busting, or bankruptcy. Rebranding can also refer to a change in a company or corporate brand that may own several sub-brands for products or companies.

==Corporations==
Rebranding became something of a fad at the turn of the millennium, with some companies rebranding several times. The rebranding of Philip Morris to Altria was done to help the company shed its negative image. Other rebrandings, such as the British Post Office&#x27;s attempt to rebrand itself as Consignia, have proved such a failure that millions more had to be spent going back to square one.

In a study of 165 cases of rebranding, Muzellec and Lambkin (2006) found that, whether a rebranding follows from corporate strategy (e.g., M&amp;A) or constitutes the actual marketing strategy (change the corporate reputation), it aims at enhancing, regaining, transferring, and/or recreating the corporate brand equity.

According to Sinclair (1999:13), business the world over acknowledges the value of brands. “Brands, it seems, alongside ownership of copyright and trademarks, computer software and specialist know-how, are now at the heart of the intangible value investors place on companies.” Companies in the 21st century may find it necessary to relook their brand in terms of its relevance to consumers and the changing marketplace. Successful rebranding projects can yield a brand better off than before.

Marketing develops the awareness and associations in the memory of customers so they know (and are reminded) of brands to serve their needs. Once in a lead position, it is marketing, consistent product or service quality, sensible pricing and effective distribution that will keep the brand ahead of the pack and provide value to its owners (Sinclair, 1999:15).

===Motivation===
Corporations often rebrand in order to respond to external and/or internal issues. Firms commonly have rebranding cycles in order to stay current with the times or set themselves ahead of the competition. Companies also utilize rebranding as an effective marketing tool to hide malpractices of the past, thereby shedding negative connotations that could potentially affect profitability.

Corporations such as Citigroup, AOL, American Express, and Goldman Sachs all utilize third-party vendors that specialize in brand strategy and the development of corporate identity. Companies invest valuable resources into rebranding and third-party vendors because it is a way to protect them from being blackballed by customers in a very competitive market. Dr. Roger Sinclair, a leading expert on brand valuation and brand equity practice worldwide stated, “A brand is a resource acquired by an enterprise that generates future economic benefits.” Once a brand has negative connotations associated with it, it can only lead to decreased profitability and possibly complete corporate failure. 

====Differentiation from competitors====
Companies differentiate themselves from competitors by incorporating practices from changing their logo to going green. Differentiation from competitors is important in order to attract more customers and an effective way to draw in more desirable employees. The need to differentiate is especially prevalent in saturated markets such as the financial services industry.

====Elimination of a negative image====
Organisations may rebrand intentionally to shed negative images of the past. Research suggests that &quot;concern over external perceptions of the organisation and its activities&quot; can function as a major driver in rebranding exercises.

In a corporate context, managers can utilize rebranding as an effective marketing strategy to hide malpractices and avoid or shed negative connotations and decreased profitability. Corporations such as Philip Morris USA, Blackwater and AIG rebranded in order to shed negative images. Philip Morris USA rebranded its name and logo to Altria on January 27, 2003 due to the negative connotations associated with tobacco products that could have had potential to affect the profitability of other Philip Morris brands such as Kraft Foods.

In 2008, AIG&#x27;s image became damaged due to its need for a Federal bailout during the financial crisis. AIG was bailed out because the United States Treasury stated that AIG was too big to fail due to its size and complex relationships with financial counterparties. AIG itself is a huge international firm; however, the AIG Retirement and AIG Financial subsidiaries were left with negative connotations due to the bailout. As a result, AIG Financial Advisors and AIG Retirement respectively rebranded into Sagepoint Financial and VALIC (Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company) to shed the negative image associated with AIG.

====Lost market share====
Brands often rebrand in reaction to losing market share. In these cases, the brands have become less meaningful to target audiences and, therefore, lost share to competitors.

In some cases, companies try to build on any perceived equity they believe still exists in their brand. Radio Shack, for example, rebranded itself as &quot;the Shack&quot; in 2008 but the rebranding never realized into an increase of market share in the retail industry. By 2017, Radio Shack had significantly reduced its physical retail presence, closing over 1,000 stores and shifted to a primarily online retail business model.

====Emergent situations====
Rebranding may also occur unintentionally from emergent situations such as “Chapter 11 corporate restructuring,” or “bankruptcy.” Chapter 11 is rehabilitation or reorganization used primarily by business debtors. It’s more commonly known as corporate bankruptcy, which is a form of corporate financial reorganization that allows companies to function while they pay off their debt. Companies such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, Washington Mutual and General Motors have all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

On July 1, 2009 General Motors filed for bankruptcy, which was fulfilled on July 10, 2009. General Motors decided to rebrand its entire structure by investing more in Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac automobiles. Furthermore, it decided to sell Saab Automobile and discontinue the Hummer, Pontiac, and Saturn brands. General Motors rebranded by stating they are reinventing and rebirthing the company as “The New GM” with “Fewer, stronger brands. Fewer, stronger models. Greater efficiencies, better fuel economy, and new technologies” as stated in their reinvention commercial. General Motors&#x27; reinvention commercial also stated that eliminating brands “isn’t about going out of business, but getting down to business.”

==== Product line ====
Companies like Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, Joann Fabrics, and Weight Watchers, have removed or abbreviated parts of their company names to suggest a larger product line offering than what their names solely imply. It is also used to cater to different demographics who may be interested in different products of the same industry. In a 2018 marketing stunt, pancake restaurant chain IHOP announced a rebranding to &quot;IHOb&quot; to promote a line of hamburgers, but did not follow through with the rebranding.

==== Staying relevant ====
Companies can also choose to rebrand to remain relevant to its (new) customers and stakeholders. This could occur when a company&#x27;s business has changed, for example its strategic direction and industry focus, or its brand no longer fits its (new) customer base. For example, a company might rebrand so that its name works in new market it enters, for reasons of culture or language, such as to make it easier to pronounce.

Rebranding is also a way to refresh an image to ensure its appeal to contemporary customers and stakeholders. What once looked fresh and relevant may no longer do so years later.

==Products==

As for product offerings, when they are marketed separately to several target markets this is called market segmentation. When part of a market segmentation strategy involves offering significantly different products in each market, this is called product differentiation. This market segmentation/product differentiation process can be thought of as a form of rebranding. What distinguishes it from other forms of rebranding is that the process does not entail the elimination of the original brand image. Rebranding in this manner allows one set of engineering and QA to be used to create multiple products with minimal modifications and additional expense. Another form of product rebranding is the sale of a product manufactured by another company under a new name: an original design manufacturer is a company that manufactures a product, often in a location with lower operating costs, which is eventually branded by another firm for sale.

Following a merger or acquisition, companies usually rebrand newly-acquired products to keep them consistent with an existing product line, such as Symantec placing acquired security and utility software under its Norton brand (itself an offshoot of flagship product Norton Antivirus). This can also happen in reverse if an acquired brand has wider recognition in the market than that of the purchaser, such as Chemical Bank taking on the Chase branding after its merger with the company.

==Small businesses==
Small businesses face different challenges from large corporations and must adapt their rebranding strategy accordingly.
Rather than implementing change gradually, small businesses are sometimes better served by rebranding their image in a short timeframe – especially when existing brand notoriety is low. “The powerful first impression on new clients made possible by professional brand design often outweighs an outdated or poorly-designed image’s weak brand recognition to existing clients”.
A change of image in a large corporation can have costly repercussions (updating signage in multiple locations, large quantities of existing collateral, communicating with a large number of employees, etc.), while small businesses can enjoy more mobility and implement change more quickly. While small businesses can experience growth without necessarily having a professionally designed brand image, &quot;rebranding becomes a critical step for a company to be considered seriously when expanding to more aggressive markets and facing competitors with more established brand images&quot;.

== Impact ==
The ubiquitous nature of a company/product brand across all customer touchpoints makes rebranding a heavy undertaking for companies. According to the iceberg model, 80% of the impact is hidden. The level of impact of changing a brand depends on the degree to which the brand is changed.

There are several elements of a brand that can be changed in a rebranding these include the name, the logo, the legal name, and the corporate identity (including visual identity and verbal identity). Changes made only to the company logo have the lowest impact (called a logo-swap), and changes made to the name, legal name, and other identity elements will touch every part of the company and can result in high costs and impact on large complex organizations.

Rebranding affects not only marketing material but also digital channels, URLs, signage, clothing, and correspondence.

<text>Peter Benson Carlisle (born October 12, 1952) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 13th Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii from 2010 to 2013. Prior to serving as interim Mayor following the resignation of former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann (in Hannemann&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to run for Hawaii State governor against former U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie), Carlisle had served as the Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu from 1996 to 2010.

==Personal life==

Carlisle was born in 1952 in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He attended Kent School in Connecticut and pursued an undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Psychology and English, he attended the UCLA School of Law.

Carlisle first came to Hawaii in 1978 where he met and married Judy.

Peter Carlisle&#x27;s first experience with prosecution in Hawaii came in a work/study program with the Honolulu prosecutor&#x27;s office. After receiving his Juris Doctor degree from UCLA, he was recruited as a deputy prosecutor for the City and County of Honolulu. He remained in that job for over a decade, attaining the responsibility of chief of the Career Criminal Unit.

In 1988, Carlisle went into private practice for the Honolulu law firm of Shim, Tam, Kirimitsu, Kitamura and Chang where he worked for eight years, mostly handling personal injury cases. In 1996 he ran for Prosecuting Attorney of the City and County of Honolulu and was elected.

Carlisle is an opponent of capital punishment. While in office as prosecuting attorney he pushed for tougher sentencing laws and led a successful fight to amend the state constitution to allow for &quot;information charging&quot; and eliminate the requirement that victims and other witnesses testify during preliminary or grand jury hearings. He was later criticized by the Hawai&#x27;i Supreme Court for using taxpayer money to promote the constitutional amendment.

==Election history==
Peter Carlisle&#x27;s opponents in 1996 for the role of Honolulu Prosecutor were defense attorney and three-year deputy prosecutor David Arakawa and former deputy prosecutor and Liquor Commission administrator Randal Yoshida. Keith Kaneshiro, who was Prosecuting Attorney since 1988, endorsed David Arakawa. David Arakawa came out ahead of Carlisle in the primary, but did not win over 50% of the vote in the September election to win outright. Carlisle steadily gained in the polls after the September Primary and beat Arakawa in the November runoff in the general election.

Political analysts credited Carlisle&#x27;s more extensive experience as a deputy prosecutor, his independence from political parties, and his performance in televised debates as reasons for winning. Carlisle ran unopposed in 2000 for a second four-year term as Prosecuting Attorney.

In the 2004 Hawaii Primary Election, former Honolulu Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro challenged Carlisle. Carlisle received 58.4% of the vote as opposed to Kaneshiro&#x27;s 34.1%.

In 2008, Carlisle ran unopposed for an unprecedented fourth term as Honolulu Prosecutor.

On September 18, 2010, Carlisle won the special election for Honolulu mayor to complete the final two years of former mayor Mufi Hannemann&#x27;s term. Hannemann resigned as mayor to run for Hawaii governor. Carlisle was sworn into office as the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu on October 11, 2010. He ran for re-election in the 2012 mayoral election but failed to advance to the general election after finishing third in the primary behind former Hawaii Governor Ben Cayetano and former acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell.

On August 12, 2012, Carlisle came in third out of three candidates in the non-partisan Honolulu mayoral primary election, thus eliminating him from the race. Neither of the top two finishers, Ben Cayetano and acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell, garnered the necessary 50% plus one vote necessary to win the Mayor&#x27;s office outright. They went on to a runoff election on November 6, 2012, which Caldwell won.

==As Prosecuting Attorney==
Along with administering the Honolulu Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, Carlisle personally prosecuted several cases during his term, including the mass murder trial of Byran Uyesugi who shot and killed seven of his co-workers at a Xerox warehouse in Honolulu. The jury found Uyesugi guilty of First Degree Murder. He also successfully prosecuted Kirk Lankford.

Carlisle held faculty positions as an adjunct professor with the University of Hawaiʻi System William S. Richardson School of Law, at the National Institute for Trial Advocacy and at the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina. He was a member of the board of directors of the National District Attorney&#x27;s Association and in 2002 was awarded the Mothers Against Drunk Driving National Criminal Justice Award.

==As Honolulu mayor==

In July 2009, Carlisle announced that when Mayor of Honolulu Mufi Hannemann left office to run for governor, he would resign from the office of the prosecuting attorney to run for mayor of Honolulu. On July 20, 2010, Mufi Hannemann announced his resignation from the mayor&#x27;s office. Carlisle subsequently announced his resignation as prosecuting attorney. He ran against three other major contenders: Acting Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who was appointed managing director by Mufi Hannemann and became the acting mayor when Hannemann resigned to run for governor, UH Professor and former Mayoral candidate Panos Prevedouros, and City Councilmember Rod Tam.

Carlisle won the special mayoral election on September 18, 2010, and was sworn into office on October 11, 2010, becoming the first mayor in Honolulu history to be identified as an Independent.

As mayor, Carlisle was a major supporter of the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project, and worked to redevelop and restore Honolulu&#x27;s infrastructure. During the APEC United States 2011 summit meetings in Honolulu, Carlisle promoted Honolulu as a major hub for Asia-Pacific and international business, and as a world-class city and Pacific icon. Carlisle was also an advocate of alternative energy and environmental sustainability.

<text>Twizel () is the largest town in the Mackenzie District, in the Canterbury Region of the South Island of New Zealand. The town was founded in 1968 to house construction workers on the Upper Waitaki Hydroelectric Scheme. Today, Twizel is a service and tourist town for visitors to the area. It has a resident population of during the summer, holidaymakers nearly triple the town&#x27;s population.

Nearby Lake Ruataniwha supports rowing, sailing and water skiing. Twizel is 37 km (29 minutes drive) east of Lake Ōhau village, 30 km (20 minutes drive) north of Omarama and 60 km (42 minutes drive) south of Lake Tekapo.

==History==

=== Hydro town ===
The present town was built in 1968 by the Ministry of Works and Development as a greenfields project to house workers constructing the Upper Waitaki hydroelectricity scheme. The name comes from the nearby Twizel River, in turn named for Twizel Bridge in Northumberland by John Turnbull Thomson, Chief Surveyor of Otago in the mid-19th century.

The Waitaki hydro scheme consisted of of canals, two dams, and four powerhouses (Tekapo B, Ōhau A, B and C), and the formation of Lake Ruataniwha, producing 848 MW of electricity. At the height of the project in the 1970s, population peaked of around 6,000.

At the time when the construction of the Upper Waitaki hydroelectricity scheme peaked, roughly in 1976, there were 800 cabins for single people and 1,224 family homes in Twizel. These mostly belonged to the Ministry of Works and Development to house the 1,900 employees of the Upper Waitaki hydroelectricity scheme.

The town was laid out in a &#x27;Scandinavian&#x27; fashion, featuring looping roads and pedestrian ways, making it usually far more direct to walk than use a car. Shops, school, and recreational parkland formed a hub in the centre of the town, around which the residential area were built. A previous version of this layout had been tried at Otematata. Accommodation was highly segregated: in addition to single men&#x27;s quarters in the middle of town, there was a series of different houses available, with the smallest for workers, &quot;staff houses&quot; for teachers and professionals, and the largest for engineers and other high-status residents.

As the intention was for the town to revert to farmland, there were many temporary features. For example, instead of putting in kerbing, channels, and footpaths at the edge of the road, a single expanse of seal was contoured in a very flat &#x27;W&#x27; shape: the seal was highest at the outer edge (footpath) and in the middle (centreline), with a lower area serving as a channel and delineation between the roadway and footpath. Likewise, most of the town&#x27;s telephone local loop is strung above ground to save the task of burying and then removing the lines. Most houses were prefabricated, and intended to be portable. Some were brought from Otematata, and some were later moved to Clyde for the next hydroelectricity project.

=== Hydroelectric scheme winds down ===
Government ministers argued that the town was intended to be temporary and eventually demolished. The government ministers saw Twizel as a financial liability. In October 1981, 100 houses had been reserved with the intention to transport them to Aramoana in expectation that the proposed aluminium smelter would be built. Several overseas investors offered to buy the whole town and develop it for tourism. One such investor, had plans to turn it into a &quot;Las Vegas style casino town&quot;.

By 1982, the population had fallen to around 3,500 people. During 1983, the Ministry of Works and Development started to sell houses and garages. Several hundred were sold and transported away by new owners.

However, in 1983, as the hydroelectric project was winding up and finally ended in 1986. Residents successfully fought to save the town itself. The town was handed over to the Mackenzie County Council. The government offered 325 houses, 100 further sections, community facilities and a cash grant to the council. The Mackenzie County Council then offered these for sale. In 1984, the Mackenzie County Council eventually took over 540 houses and 14 shops as well as the 100 sections and community facilities.

=== Post hydro town ===

With the local government reorganisation that occurred in 1989, Twizel came under the auspices of the Mackenzie District Council.

With the construction phase completed of the Upper Waitaki hydroelectricity scheme, the makeup of the town in the late 1980s was significantly different. The population (of 1179 people in 1986, declining to 1017 people in 1991) was now made of those working on the operations side of the hydroelectric scheme, working in the service sector, retired and those taking advantage of the cheap housing. Some houses became holiday homes for people living out of town. Tourism developed slowly in the 1990s with a number of hotels and motels being built.

Twizel was the base for some of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand operations workforce. In 1999, Meridian Energy, which had inherited the local assets, moved its operations base from Twizel to Christchurch.

In 2009, the community were consulted in a workshop to identify issues and gaps in services that residents felt existed. Issues identified included the viability of emergency services, accessibility of health services, residential care for the elderly, access to dental care and drug and alcohol services.

In 2015, the new $1.8 million Twizel Medical Centre was completed. This included a helipad in order to transport sick patients to hospital via helicopter. Meridian Energy provided $150,000 funding for the helipad.

A building boom occurred in 2017 with five new subdivisions all sold and a busy construction industry.

Financial support to build an aviary near Twizel in order to support the conservation of the black stilt (kakī) was provided in 2017 by the Sangreal Foundation. The captive breeding programme in Twizel (and Christchurch) was a success in 2021 with 150 juvenile black stilt (kakī) being released into the wild. The 2021 breeding season was also deemed a success with eighteen black stilt chicks hatching over the Christmas period.

By early 2019, tourism played an important part in the economy of Twizel. By this stage, tourists had spent one million overnight stays in the town, unemployment was sitting at less than 1% and employers could not recruit for jobs. Twizel would get very busy during the summer months and during rowing events.

Twizel&#x27;s population is expected to grow by 2.6% each year between 2020 and 2050. with the population expected to grow to 3395 people in the year 2050. The Mackenzie District Council presented three options for how the town could evolve with the growth. in October 2020. Local residents provided negative feedback to the plans with complaints that they were too similar and said that the population growth was underestimated.In January 2021, there were concerns that the display of earth moving vehicles, that was used in the Waitaki hydroelectric power projects, at the entrance to the town were unsafe. A report recommended that the vehicles were either fenced off or brought up to the standards that playgrounds are expected to be at.

In May 2021, work began on a $6.5 million project to replace the asbestos cement water pipes with polyethylene pipes as the old pipes had reached the end of their useful life.

Management of the pool was awarded to Belgravia Leisure after a report written in September 2020 for the Mackenzie District Council found health and safety issues with the way that the council was running the pool. Plans exist in 2021 to heat the pools as community feedback was almost unanimous that the pools were too cold.

The Twizel events centre was built in 2001. It is located at the Market Place in the centre of town. The events centre includes a sports hall, community room plus kitchen and a theatre hall. It never received a Code Compliance Certificate. It was at risk of being closed down in 2021 with the discovery of asbestos and other safety concerns such as broken ventilation systems, improperly installed fire dampers, concerns with theatre seating, lack of seismic restraints, non-compliant fire safety equipment, non-functioning emergency lighting, and a locked fire exit. Mackenzie mayor Graham Smith said of the building “I really want to see this building put right. We need to address it&quot;.

These were merged in 1986 to form the Twizel Area School. The co-educational school has a roll of students as of In April 2020, a commissioner was made responsible for the governance of Twizel Area School. The appointment of the commissioner was made at the request of its board of trustees. In March 2021, Twizel Area School returned to being run by the Board of Trustee with the commissioner stating that &quot;The future of the school is bright and there is a lot to look forward to&quot;.

In July 2020, the New Zealand government announced a $21 million rebuild of the Twizel Area School. The relocatable classrooms would be replaced. In August 2021, the school was still awaiting plans to be developed and there was yet to be a timeframe for when construction would begin.

== In popular culture ==
In the movie &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, the battle of the Pelennor Fields was filmed near Twizel, as was a scene in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy of movies where Bilbo and the Dwarves are chased across the plains by Warg riders. In 2013, the Michael Fassbender movie &quot;Slow West&quot; was partly filmed around Twizel. A short film called &quot;Tinsel over Twizel&quot; has been used as a proof of concept in order to then make a romantic comedy full-length movie to be filmed on location in Twizel.

<text>Yevonde Philone Middleton (née Cumbers; 5 January 1893 – 22 December 1975) was an English photographer, who pioneered the use of colour in portrait photography. She used the professional name Madame Yevonde or simply Yevonde in a career lasting over 60 years.

==Early life==
Yevonde Philone Cumbers was born on 5 January 1893 in Streatham. She was the eldest of two daughters, and with Verena, her younger sister, the family moved to Bromley in 1899. She was initially educated by a governess and a local day school, then at the liberal and progressive Lingholt Boarding School in Hindhead and subsequently at the Guilde Internationale in Paris, as well as boarding schools in Belgium and France. From an early age Yevonde Cumbers displayed an independent attitude. Her heroine was women&#x27;s liberationist Mary Wollstonecraft, and she joined the Suffragette movement in 1910.

Upon leaving school, she returned to the family home in Bromley, Kent, and became active in suffragette activities, but realised that she was not cut out to be a leader in the field of women&#x27;s rights. Cumbers eventually ceased her active involvement, but not before answering an advert she had seen in The Suffragette for a photographer&#x27;s apprentice. She attended an interview with Lena Connell, who took austere photos of nobility and suffragette leaders.

Instead, Cumbers sought, and was given, a three-year apprenticeship with the portrait photographer Lallie Charles. In 1914, with the technical grounding she received from working with Charles, and a gift of £250 from her father, at the age of 21 Yevonde set up her own studio at 92 Victoria Street, London, and began to make a name for herself by inviting well-known figures to sit for free. Before long her pictures were appearing in society magazines such as the &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Sketch&quot;. Her style quickly moved away from the stiff &quot;pouter pigeon&quot; look of Lallie Charles, toward a still formal, but more creative, style. Her subjects were often pictured looking away from the camera, and she began using props to creative effect.

By 1921, Madame Yevonde had become a well-known and respected portrait photographer, and moved to larger premises at 100 Victoria Street. Here she began taking advertising commissions and also photographed many of the leading personalities of the day, including A.A. Milne, Barbara Cartland, Diana Mitford, Louis Mountbatten and Noël Coward.

== Career ==
In the early 1930s, Yevonde began experimenting with colour photography, using the new Vivex colour process from Colour Photography Limited of Willesden. The introduction of colour photography was not universally popular; indeed photographers and the public alike were so used to black-and-white pictures that early reactions to the new process tended toward the hostile. Yevonde, however, was hugely enthusiastic about it and spent countless hours in her studio experimenting with how to get the best results. Her dedication paid huge dividends. In 1932 she put on an exhibition of portrait work at the Albany Gallery, half monochrome and half colour, to enthusiastic reviews.

In an address to the Royal Photographic Society in 1932, Yevonde argued that women were more strongly suited to embrace colour photography, because colour was more important to women&#x27;s lives.

In 1933, Madame Yevonde moved once again, this time to 28 Berkeley Square. She began using colour in her advertising work as well as her portraits, and took on other commissions too. In 1936, she was commissioned by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine to photograph the last stages in the fitting out of the new Cunard liner, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. This was very different from Yevonde&#x27;s usual work, but the shoot was a success. &quot;People&quot; printed twelve plates, and pictures were exhibited in London and New York City. One of the portraits was of artist Doris Zinkeisen who was commissioned together with her sister Anna to paint several murals for the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Another major coup was being invited to take portraits of leading peers to mark the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. She joined the Royal Photographic Society briefly in 1921 and then again in 1933, and became a Fellow in 1940. The RPS Collection holds examples of her work.

Yevonde&#x27;s most famous work was inspired by a theme party held on 5 March 1935, where guests dressed as Roman and Greek gods and goddesses. Yevonde subsequently took studio portraits of many of the participants (and others), in appropriate costume and surrounded by appropriate objects. This series of prints showed Yevonde at her most creative, using colour, costume and props to build an otherworldly air around her subjects. She went on to produce further series based on the signs of the zodiac and the months of the year. Partly influenced by surrealist artists, particularly Man Ray, Yevonde used surprising juxtapositions of objects which displayed her sense of humour.

This highly creative period of Yevonde&#x27;s career would only last a few years. At the end of 1939, Colour Photographs Ltd closed, and the Vivex process was no more. It was the second major blow to Yevonde that year—her husband, the playwright Edgar Middleton, had died in April. Yevonde returned to working in black and white, and produced many notable portraits. She continued working up until her death, just two weeks short of her 83rd birthday, but is chiefly remembered for her work of the 1930s, which did much to make colour photography respectable.

In her 1940 memoir, &quot;In Camera&quot;, Yevonde wrote, &#x27;I took up photography with the definite purpose of making myself independent. I wanted to earn money of my own&#x27;.

== Exhibitions ==
* &quot;Be Original or Die Photographs by Madame Yevonde&quot; in 1953 featured 64 color photographs produced from original glass plate negatives and Vivex prints. It showed her &quot;Goddesses&quot; series of 1935, in which society women posed in, surreal, mythical guises.
* &quot;Madame Yevonde: Colour, Fantasy &amp; Myth&quot; was a retrospective of her work at the Royal Photographic Society, Bath and the National Portrait Gallery, London in 1990. An exhibition catalogue was also published by the Gallery.
* &quot;Goddesses and Others: Photographs by Madame Yevonde&quot; in 2005 at the National Portrait Gallery, London displayed 15 of her colour photographs from the 1930s.
* &quot;Yevonde: Life and Colour&quot;, a third National Portrait Gallery exhibition, opened in London on 22 June 2023, with an accompanying catalogue edited by Clare Freestone.

<text>Emilio Salgari ( ; 21 August 1862 – 25 April 1911) was an Italian writer of action adventure swashbucklers and a pioneer of science fiction.

In Italy, his extensive body of work was more widely read than that of Dante Alighieri. In the 21st century, he is still among the 40 most translated Italian authors. Many of his most popular novels have been adapted as comics, animated series and feature films. He is considered the father of Italian adventure fiction and Italian pop culture, and the &quot;grandfather&quot; of the Spaghetti Western.

==Life==

Emilio Salgari was born in Verona to a family of modest merchants. From a young age, he had the desire to explore the seas and studied seamanship at a nautical technical institution in Venice, but his academic performance was too poor, and he never graduated.

He began his writing career as a reporter for the daily &quot;La Nuova Arena,&quot; which published some of his work as serials. As his powers of narration grew, so did his reputation for having lived a life of adventure. He claimed to have explored the Sudan desert, met Buffalo Bill in Nebraska (he had actually met him during his &quot;Wild West Show&quot; tour of Italy), and sailed the Seven Seas. His early biographies were filled with adventurous tales set in the Far East, events which he claimed were the basis for much of his work. Salgari had actually never ventured farther than the Adriatic Sea.

He turned his passion for exploration and discovery to writing. His first stories were serialized in newspapers. Early in his career, he began signing his tales as &quot;Captain Salgari&quot;, a title he once defended in a duel when his claim to it was questioned.

Though knighted by the Queen of Italy and wildly popular, Salgari did not earn much money from his books and lived hand to mouth for most of his life.

Salgari married Ida Peruzzi – nicknamed &quot;Aida,&quot; with whom he was very happy for years. The couple had four children. Salgari&#x27;s private life was clouded by several tragedies. In 1889 his father committed suicide. Ida became ill after 1903 and Salgari&#x27;s struggling increased with her medical bills.

These events led Salgari to depression, and he attempted suicide in 1910. After Ida was committed to a mental ward in 1911, Salgari was overwhelmed and took his own life soon afterwards, imitating the Japanese ritual of &quot;seppuku&quot;, and died on 25 April 1911. He left three letters, addressed to his and Ida&#x27;s children, his publisher, and the editors of his newspaper in Turin. The letter to his publisher said:

One of the sons of Emilio and Aida also committed suicide in 1933.

==Writing career==
Salgari wrote more than 200 adventure stories and novels, setting his tales in exotic locations, with heroes from a wide variety of cultures. He gained inspiration from reading foreign literature and newspapers, travel magazines and encyclopedias, which he used to portray his heroes&#x27; worlds. He wrote four major series: &quot;The Pirates of Malaysia&quot;; &quot;The Black Corsair Saga&quot;; &quot;The Pirates of Bermuda&quot;; and a collection of adventures set in the Old West. Salgari&#x27;s heroes were mostly pirates, outlaws and barbarians, fighting against greed, abuse of power, and corruption.

His most famous heroes Sandokan, The Tiger of Malaysia, a Bornean prince turned pirate, and his loyal lieutenant Yanez of Gomera, led their men in attacks against the Dutch and British fleets. They declared war on James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak, and tried to force him from his throne. The Black Corsair and Captain Morgan maintained a chivalric code in the Caribbean, while Salgari&#x27;s pirates of Bermuda fought for American independence.

His tales had been so popular that soon his publisher hired other writers to develop adventure stories under his name. They added 50 novels to his “canon”. Salgari&#x27;s style was imitated by many, but no other Italian adventure writer managed to duplicate his popular success.

He also published numerous minor works, among which &quot;Il Brick Maledetto&quot; (Milano, Sonzogno, 1936) published posthumously.

==Legacy==

Salgari&#x27;s work was imitated in one form or another by many who came after him. A large part of the Italian adventure literature is a continuation of Salgari&#x27;s work. Many late 19th century writers such as Luigi Motta and Emilio Fancelli wrote further &quot;Sandokan&quot; adventures imitating Salgari&#x27;s style: fast-paced, filled with great battles, blood, violence and punctuated with humour.

The style soon spread to films and television. One example is the work of the director Sergio Leone, whose outlaw heroes in his Spaghetti Westerns were inspired by Salgari&#x27;s piratical adventurers. More than 50 film adaptations have been made of Salgari&#x27;s novels, and many more were inspired by his work (corsair stories, jungle adventure stories, and swashbuckling B movies, such as &quot;Morgan, the Pirate&quot;, starring Steve Reeves).

Federico Fellini loved Salgari&#x27;s books. Pietro Mascagni had over 50 Salgari titles in his library. Umberto Eco read Salgari&#x27;s works as a child.

His work was very popular in Portugal, Spain and Spanish-speaking countries, where Latin American writers such as Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda, all attested to reading him when young. Che Guevara read 62 of his books, according to his biographer Paco Ignacio Taibo II, who remarked that the revolutionary&#x27;s anti-imperialism could be seen to be &quot;Salgarian in origin&quot;.

Though popular with the masses, Salgari was shunned by critics throughout his life and for most of the 20th century. It was not until the late 1990s that his writings began to be revisited, and new translations appeared in print. They have been newly appreciated for their characterization and plots. In 2001 the first National Salgari Association was founded in Italy to celebrate his work.

==Films==

Historians debate the first film adaptation of a Salgari novel. &quot;Cabiria&quot;, directed by Giovanni Pastrone bears many similarities to Emilio Salgari&#x27;s 1908 adventure novel &quot;Cartagine in Fiamme&quot; (Carthage is Burning). Salgari was never credited, and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio was billed as the official screenwriter. D&#x27;Annunzio had been brought on board to help revise the film once it had been shot, earning the credit by changing the title to &quot;Cabiria,&quot; changing the name of some of the characters, and rewriting the captions from what Pastrone had done. The three-hour epic movie with its cast of thousands created a sensation throughout Italy. It pioneered epic screen production and foreshadowed the work of D.W. Griffith, Sergei Eisenstein and others.

Vitale De Stefano brought Salgari&#x27;s pirates to the big screen in the early 1920s with a series of five films shot over two years, including &quot;Il corsaro nero&quot; The Black Corsair and &quot;La Regina dei caraibi&quot; (The Queen of the Caribbean). Lex Barker appeared as the tiger hunter Tremal-Naik in the 1955 B-movie &quot;The Mystery of The Black Jungle&quot;. Sandokan was played by Hercules star Steve Reeves in &quot;Sandokan the Great&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Malaysia aka The Pirates of The Seven Seas&quot;. Ray Danton played the pirate in Luigi Capuano&#x27;s &quot;Sandokan Against the Leopard of Sarawak&quot; (aka &quot;Throne of Vengeance&quot;.) and later reprised the role in &quot;Sandokan Fights Back&quot; (aka &quot;The Conqueror and the Empress&quot;).

The 1944 Mexican film &quot;El corsario negro&quot; is based on his novel &quot;The Black Corsair&quot;.

The 1965 adventure film &quot;La montagna di luce&quot; (&quot;The Mountain of Light&quot;) was loosely based on Salgari&#x27;s 1902 novel of the same title, which referred to the name of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The film was released in English under several titles, the most commonly known of which was &quot;Jungle Adventurer&quot;. One of the alternate titles used for a later re-release was &quot;Sandok&quot;, an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Salgari&#x27;s fictional pirate Sandokan, even though neither the novel, nor the film had anything to do with Sandokan&#x27;s character or the settings of his adventures (the plot revolved around a fictitious attempt to steal the Koh-i-Noor, and took place in 19th-century India).

In 1976, the landmark &quot;Sandokan&quot; TV miniseries played throughout Europe. It starred Kabir Bedi in the title role and attracted more than 80 million viewers a week. Bedi has been considered the quintessential Sandokan ever since. He later reprised the role in the late 1990s in a series of sequels.

Salgari&#x27;s works have been published by numerous publishing houses worldwide. These include: Donath, Viglongo, Carroccio, RCS MediaGroup, and Mondadori in Italian; Saturnino Calleja, Editorial Porrúa (Colección Sepan Cuantos) and Ediciones Gaviota in Spanish; Editora Illuminuras in Portuguese; Bouquins in French; ABLIT Verlag in German; and ROH Press in English.

<text>Siri Hustvedt (born February 19, 1955) is an American novelist and essayist. Hustvedt is the author of a book of poetry, seven novels, two books of essays, and several works of non-fiction. Her books include &quot;The Blindfold&quot; (1992), &quot;The Enchantment of Lily Dahl&quot; (1996), &quot;What I Loved&quot; (2003), for which she is best known, &quot;A Plea for Eros&quot; (2006), &quot;The Sorrows of an American&quot; (2008), &quot;The Shaking Woman or A History of My Nerves&quot; (2010), &quot;The Summer Without Men&quot; (2011), &quot;Living, Thinking, Looking&quot; (2012), &quot;The Blazing World&quot; (2014), and &quot;Memories of the Future&quot; (2019). &quot;What I Loved&quot; and &quot;The Summer Without Men&quot; were international bestsellers. Her work has been translated into over thirty languages.

==Early life==

Daughter of American professor Lloyd Hustvedt and a Norwegian mother, and grew up in Northfield, Minnesota, speaking both English and Norwegian. Siri attended public school in her hometown, Northfield, Minnesota, and received a degree from the Cathedral School in Bergen, Norway, in 1973. 

She started writing at 13 after a family trip to Reykjavík, where she read various works of classic literature. Particularly impressed by Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, she decided that she wanted to make literature her profession after finishing it. Hustvedt graduated from St. Olaf College with a B.A. in history in 1977. She moved to New York City to attend Columbia University as a graduate student in 1978. Her first published work was a poem in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;. Hustvedt lived in poverty during her college years, and resorted to an emergency loan from the university to survive.

==Career==
A small collection of poems, &quot;Reading to You&quot;, appeared in 1982 with Station Hill Press.

She completed her PhD in English at Columbia in 1986. Her dissertation on Charles Dickens, &quot;Figures of Dust: A Reading of Our Mutual Friend&quot;, is an exploration of language and identity in the novel, with particular emphasis on Dickens&#x27;s metaphors of fragmentation, his use of pronouns, and their relation to a narrative, dialogical conception of self. She refers in the dissertation to thinkers who influenced her later writing, including Søren Kierkegaard, Emile Benveniste, Roman Jakobson, Mikhail Bakhtin, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Mary Douglas, Paul Ricoeur, and Julia Kristeva.

After finishing her dissertation, Hustvedt began writing prose. Two stories of the four that would become her first novel, &quot;The Blindfold&quot;, were published in literary magazines and later included in &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; 1990 and 1991. Since then she has continued to write fiction and publish essays on the intersections between philosophy, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience. She also writes regularly about visual art. Hustvedt gave the third annual Schelling lecture on aesthetics at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.

She has also given talks at the Prado in Madrid and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and published a volume of essays on painting: &quot;Mysteries of the Rectangle&quot;. In 2011, she delivered the annual Sigmund Freud lecture in Vienna, one of a distinguished list of speakers that includes Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Jessica Benjamin, Mark Solms, and Judith Butler.

==Themes==

Hustvedt is a scholar and intellectual who engages with fundamental questions of contemporary ethics and epistemology. In her visits to European and German universities, she has given readings from her works and contributed to the interdisciplinary dialogue between the humanities and the sciences, notably in a keynote lecture and panel discussion on the relationship between the life sciences and literature at the 2012 annual conference of the German Association for American Studies in Mainz. In 2013, she delivered the opening keynote address at an international conference on Søren Kierkegaard in Copenhagen on the occasion of his 200th birthday.

Hustvedt has published essays and papers in academic journals, including Contemporary Psychoanalysis, Seizure: European Journal of Epilepsy, Neuropsychoanalysis, and &quot;Clinical Neurophysiology&quot;. Her collection of essays &quot;Living, Thinking, Looking&quot; demonstrates her intellectual range across several disciplines. In 2012, she received the International Gabarron Prize for Thought and Humanities. &quot;The Blazing World&quot; was long-listed for the Booker Prize, and she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo.

Her works pose questions about the nature of identity, selfhood and perception. In &quot;The Shaking Woman or A History of My Nerves&quot;, an account of her seizure disorder, Hustvedt states her need to view her symptom not &quot;through a single-window&quot; but &quot;from all angles.&quot; These multiple perspectives do not resolve themselves into a single view but rather create an atmosphere of ambiguity and flux. Hustvedt presents the reader with characters whose minds are inseparable from their bodies and their environments and whose sense of self is situated on the threshold between the conscious and unconscious. Her characters often suffer traumatic events that disrupt the rhythms of their lives and lead to disorientation and a discontinuity of their identities. Hustvedt&#x27;s concern with embodied identity manifests itself in her investigation of gender roles and interpersonal relations. Both her fiction and nonfiction highlight the dynamics of the gaze and questions of ethics in art.

==Awards and recognitions==
A section of &quot;The Blindfold&quot; was made into a movie by the French filmmaker Claude Miller. The film &quot;La Chambre des Magiciennes&quot; won The International Critics Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. &quot;What I Loved&quot; was on the initial shortlist for the Prix Femina Étranger in France for best foreign book of the year. It was also short-listed for Waterstone&#x27;s Literary Fiction Award in England and the Barcelona Bookseller&#x27;s Award in Spain. It won the Prix des libraires du Quebec in Canada for best book of 2003. &quot;The Summer Without Men&quot; was also shortlisted for The Femina Prize in 2011.

&quot;The Blazing World&quot; was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize and won the 2015 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction.

In 2015, Hustvedt was appointed as a lecturer in psychiatry at the Dewitt Wallace Institute for the History of Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Weill Medical School of Cornell University.

Hustvedt is the 2012 recipient of the Gabarron International Award for Thought and Humanities. In 2014, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo. She received honorary doctorates from the Université Stendhal-Grenoble, France, in 2015, and from Gutenberg University-Mainz, Germany, in 2016. In 2019 she was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award in Literature.

In 2024, Hustvedt received the Openbank Literature Award by Vanity Fair for her literary career.

==Personal life==
Hustvedt met her husband, writer Paul Auster, in 1981, and they married the following year. They lived together in Brooklyn, New York, until his death in 2024. Their daughter, Sophie Auster (born 1987), is a singer/songwriter and actress. 

In 2009, Hustvedt signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after his arrest in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for statutory rape.

<text>The president of the Treasury Board () is a minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet. The president is the chair of the Treasury Board of Canada (a committee of Cabinet in the Privy Council) and is the minister responsible for the Treasury Board Secretariat, the central agency which is responsible for accounting for the Government of Canada&#x27;s fiscal operations.

The president of the Treasury Board has been Ginette Petitpas Taylor since December 20, 2024.

== History and overview ==
As a ministerial position, the office of Treasury Board president was created in the Cabinet in 1966 when the Treasury Board Secretariat became a full-fledged department of the federal government. Prior to 1966, the minister of finance was &quot;ex officio&quot; the chairman of the Treasury Board, as the Secretariat was part of the Department of Finance since Confederation (1867).

The Secretariat is a central agency and the administrative arm of the Treasury Board. Technically, the board is a Cabinet committee of the Privy Council, and is responsible for managing the government&#x27;s fiscal and administrative responsibilities, including management of the civil service and oversight of expenditures.

The formal role of the president is to chair the Treasury Board. The officeholder is responsible for carrying out the management of the government through operationalizing the policies and programs approved by Cabinet and through providing federal departments with the necessary resources, among other things. 

==List of presidents of the Treasury Board==
This is a list of presidents of the Treasury Board since 1966, when the office became a full ministerial position in Cabinet. Prior to 1966, the Treasury Board Secretariat belonged to the Department of Finance and, as such, the minister of finance was &quot;ex officio&quot; the chairman of the Treasury Board.

<doc id="792818" wikidata="Q5020731" url="?curid=792818" title="California Open Source Textbook Project">
<text>The California Open Source Textbook Project (COSTP) was founded in 2000 by Sanford Forte, a former college textbook publishing executive. COSTP was a not-for-profit, collaborative, public/private undertaking originally created to address the high cost, content range, and consistent shortages of K-12 textbooks in California. COSTP&#x27;s mandate later expanded to include undergraduate and graduate university instructional materials, covering the entire K-20 range.

==The plan==
COSTP&#x27;s main goals were as follows:
*Leveraging free, already-existing, and widely available educational content in the public domain
*Better leveraging the substantial curriculum-based intellectual capital of California&#x27;s best K-12 teachers
*Better leveraging the substantial intellectual capital of American college and university instructors to enable open-licensed content for their institutions.
*Using innovative copyright tools to secure new and dormant K-12 textbook content that would not otherwise be made available.
*Substantially reducing the cost of textbooks for K-20 students and sponsoring institutions.
*Complete elimination of the then-current US$400M+ line item for California&#x27;s K-12 textbooks
*Significant increase in the range of content afforded to California&#x27;s K-12 textbooks
*Permanent end to California&#x27;s textbook shortages
*Creation of fully portable content holdings database that scales with classroom technologies as they are introduced.

The cost of textbooks had risen steadily over the years preceding COSTP&#x27;s founding. Critics contended that publishing companies artificially increased prices and essentially shut out competing efforts to liberate academic content from traditional copyright control. On COSTP&#x27;s inception, the State of California was spending more than US$400M annually for K-12 textbooks, yet textbook shortages were not uncommon. Cost and access were becoming serious issues—projected to get worse as enrollments to K-12 institutions were projected to dramatically increase over the next decade.

COSTP employed the advantages of open-sourced content and innovative licensing tools in an effort to inspire significantly reduced K-12 textbook costs—with the hope of eventually turning K-12 curriculum and textbook construction from a cost into a revenue generator for the State of California. Open sourced, distributed content was intended to be made available gratis by deploying innovative copyright tools provided by organizations like Creative Commons, its partners, and other organizations. COSTP made important contributions to the many organizations that followed in its wake, as the &quot;Open Educational Content&quot; movement took hold over the next 10–15 years.

It is important to note that COSTP&#x27;s mandate was not to replace printed textbooks, but simply make them less expensive to produce and distribute, thus creating many additional efficiencies in the K-12 academic content sector.

COSTP eventually graduated into a consulting role for many new entries to the Open Educational Resource (OER) sector, assisting many institutions with business modeling and analysis of textbook and online education markets, worldwide.

<text>Moon Safari is the debut studio album by French electronic music duo Air, released on 16 January 1998 by Source and Virgin Records. &quot;Moon Safari&quot; was re-released on 14 April 2008 to mark the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary, including a bound book, a DVD documentary about the duo, and a bonus CD with live performances and remixes, and on 15 March 2024, to mark the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

&quot;Moon Safari&quot; was acclaimed by critics. It is credited with setting the stage for the budding downtempo music style. By February 2012, it had sold 386,000 copies in the United States.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Moon Safari&quot; was met with general acclaim upon its release. Writing in &quot;Mixmag&quot;, Alexis Petridis called it a &quot;superbly inventive&quot; album that &quot;creates a soundworld in your living room, a world where everything&#x27;s more shiny, chic and sophisticated than reality&quot;. John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; praised Air&#x27;s &quot;sensitive but tenacious grasp of melody, a laid-back disposition and a reckless way with a Vocoder that makes them unafraid of sounding like a digital ELO&quot;, also noting similarities to Garbage on &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ethan Smith felt that though the album occasionally bears excessive resemblance to Everything but the Girl, &quot;Air leaven it all with a welcome dash of Gallic irony.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Brent DiCrescenzo remarked that the music would befit &quot;minimalist architecture design, shagging up against a tree in a field of sunflowers, waiting in line for &#x27;Space Mountain,&#x27; drinking gin upstairs in a 747 (circa 1974), and &#x27;60s Swedish industrial documentaries&quot;, adding that though the album is &quot;too cheeky&quot; for everyday listening, it is nonetheless romantic.

===Accolades===
&quot;Moon Safari&quot; was voted as the best album of the year in &quot;The Face&quot; and in &quot;Select&quot;. It featured in top 10 lists for magazines such as &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 93 on its list of the best albums of the 1990s, while the magazine&#x27;s French edition ranked it at number 65 on its &quot;100 Essential French Rock Albums&quot; list. In a retrospective review, John Bush of AllMusic commented that &quot;Moon Safari&quot; &quot;delivered the emotional power of great dance music even while pushing the barriers of what &#x27;electronica&#x27; could or should sound like&quot;, and that the album &quot;proved they could also write accessible pop songs like &#x27;Sexy Boy&#x27; and &#x27;Kelly Watch the Stars&#x27;&quot; while also containing successful experiments with less pop-oriented material. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 68 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<doc id="792833" wikidata="Q2145896" url="?curid=792833" title="Respondeat superior">
<text>Respondeat superior (Latin: &quot;let the master answer&quot;; plural: &quot;respondeant superiores&quot;) is a doctrine that a party is responsible for (and has vicarious liability for) acts of his agents. For example, in the United States, there are circumstances when an employer is liable for acts of employees performed within the course of their employment. This rule is also called the master-servant rule, recognized in both common law and civil law jurisdictions.

In a broader scope, &quot;respondeat superior&quot; is based upon the concept of vicarious liability.

==In common law==
The common law concept of &quot;respondeat superior&quot; has its roots in ancient Rome. At the time, the concept applied to slaves, as that was the meaning of what has been translated as servants, and it applied if the slave could not pay himself for the act. It was later expanded to apply to not only slaves but also animals and family members of the master of a family. 

In 1698, the doctrine was mentioned in dicta by Lord Chief Justice Sir John Holt in the English case of &quot;Jones v. Hart&quot;, 2 Salk 441, 90 Eng. Rep. (K.B. 1698). In the US, it was discussed in the case of &quot;Wright v. Wilcox&quot;, 19 Wend. 343, 32 Am. Dec. 508 (1838), in which a boy climbed on a wagon driven by defendant&#x27;s servant, who drove his horses faster, which caused the boy to be thrown and injured. The judge ruled that the master was not responsible under &quot;respondeat superior&quot; because the servant had acted in a way in driving the horses that the master had not assented to and so it was not within the scope of his employment.

US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. opined in 1891, &quot;It is hard to explain why a master is liable to the extent he is for the negligent acts of one who, at the time, really is his servant, acting within the general scope of his employment. Probably master and servant are &#x27;feigned to be all one person&#x27; by a fiction&quot;. He was of the view that the doctrine was in opposition to common sense. In 1916, the British attorney Thomas Baty wrote that the doctrine, which he called a &quot;deep-pocket theory&quot;, was &quot;derived from an inconsiderate use of precedents and a blind reliance on the slightest word of an eminent judge, and from the mistaken notion that his flights of imagination ... were actual decided cases&quot;.

When applied to physical torts, an employer–employee relationship must be established (no vicarious liability is established for work performed as an independent contractor) and the act must be committed within the scope of employment (substantially within time and geographical limits, job description and at least with partial intent to further employer&#x27;s business).

Historically, the doctrine was applied in master–servant and employer–employee relationships. When an employee or a servant commits a civil wrong against a third party, the employer or master could be liable for the acts of the servant or employee when the acts are committed within the scope of the relationship. The third party could proceed against the servant and master; that is, the employee and employer. The action against the employee would be based on his conduct. The action against the employer is based on the theory of vicarious liability in which a party can be held liable for the acts of a different party.

The employer–employee relationship is the most common area &quot;respondeat superior&quot; is applied, but the doctrine is also used in the agency relationship. Then, the principal becomes liable for the actions of the agent even if the principal did not commit the act. There are three considerations generally:
# Was the act committed within the time and space limits of the agency?
# Was the offense incidental to, or of the same general nature as, the responsibilities the agent is authorized to perform?
# Was the agent motivated to any degree to benefit the principal by committing the act?
The degree to which they are answered in the affirmative dictates the degree to which the doctrine can be applied.

Common law distinguishes between civil and criminal forms of &quot;respondeat superior&quot;.

==In US securities law==
In US securities law cases in which &quot;respondeat superior&quot; has been considered in which the company was not a knowing participant in the employee&#x27;s fraud, the results have been mixed. In &quot;O&#x27;Brien v. Dean Witter Reynolds&quot; (D. Ariz 1984), the court, emphasizing the requirement of knowing participation, stated that an employee&#x27;s knowledge could not be imputed to the employer. The court in &quot;Dakis v. Chapman&quot; (D. Cal. 1983) stressed the concept of intentional participation; liability would not attach to a firm that was merely a &quot;conduit&quot; for the employee&#x27;s securities violations. In &quot;Parnes v. Heinold Commodities&quot; (N.D. Ill. 1983), the court described the use of &quot;respondeat superior&quot; as &quot;bizarre&quot; and noted that the firm itself had been victimized by its unscrupulous employee. 

As to claims under the Securities Exchange Act, the Act&#x27;s legislative history, under which the House of Representatives version was adopted, indicates that &quot;respondeat superior&quot; is not applicable because liability is allowed only if there was participation in the employee&#x27;s fraud. Furthermore, courts such as the Southern District of New York have held that &quot;respondeat superior&quot; liability is not available under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. Similarly, Thomas Hazen wrote in &quot;Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot;Respondeat superior&quot;... do[es] not apply to sanctions for illegal trading on inside information.&quot;

As Robert Anello wrote in &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2014, &quot;Analysis of the corporate &quot;mens rea&quot; is, by definition, contrived and one with which federal courts have struggled.&quot; In the US, there is a three-way circuit split, as the Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit apply &quot;respondeat superior&quot;, the Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit apply instead a concept of &quot;collective knowledge,&quot; and the Sixth Circuit rejects the &quot;respondeat superior&quot; and collective knowledge approaches and applies a third approach because it views that neither the &quot;respondeat superior&quot; approach nor the collective knowledge approach is ideal or effectuates the purpose of securities fraud laws.

==In US government actions==
The US Supreme Court held in &quot;Ashcroft v. Iqbal&quot;, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), that senior government officials could not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of &quot;respondeat superior&quot;. This is an example of the US Supreme Court making an exception to break from the general precedent of respondeat superior.

==In international law==

At issue in the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, after the Allied occupation of Nazi Germany after World War II, was a question concerning principles closely related to &quot;respondeat superior&quot;, which came to be known by the term command responsibility. The Nuremberg Trials established that the defense cannot be used of only following a superior&#x27;s order if it violates international norms, and especially, superiors who ordered or &quot;should have known&quot; of such violations but failed to intervene are also criminally liable.

<doc id="792859" wikidata="Q305946" url="?curid=792859" title="Cp (Unix)">
<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command in various Unix and Unix-like operating systems for copying files and directories. The command has three principal modes of operation, expressed by the types of arguments presented to the program for copying a file to another file, one or more files to a directory, or for copying entire directories to another directory.

The utility further accepts various command line option flags to detail the operations performed. The two major specifications are POSIX &quot;cp&quot; and GNU &quot;cp&quot;. GNU &quot;cp&quot; has many additional options over the POSIX version.

The command is also available in the EFI shell.

==History==
cp was part of Version 1 Unix. The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund, David MacKenzie, and Jim Meyering.

==Operating modes==
cp has three principal modes of operation. These modes are inferred from the type and count of arguments presented to the program upon invocation.
*When the program has two arguments of path names to files, the program copies the contents of the first file to the second file, creating the second file if necessary.
*When the program has one or more arguments of path names of files and following those an argument of a path to a directory, then the program copies each source file to the destination directory, creating any files not already existing.
*When the program&#x27;s arguments are the path names to two directories, cp copies all files in the source directory to the destination directory, creating any files or directories needed. This mode of operation requires an additional option flag, typically &quot;r&quot;, to indicate the recursive copying of directories. If the destination directory already exists, the source is copied into the destination, while a new directory is created if the destination does not exist.

== Usage ==
Copying a file to another file:
 cp [-fHip][--] sourcefile targetfile

Copying file(s) to a directory
 cp [-fHip] [--] sourcefile... targetdirectory

Copying a directory to a directory (-r or -R must be used)
 cp -r|-R [-fHip] [--] sourcedirectory... targetdirectory

==Option flags==
*codice_3 (force) – specifies removal of the target file if it cannot be opened for write operations. The removal precedes any copying performed by the codice_1 command.
* codice_5 (dereference) – makes the codice_1 command follow symbolic links (symlinks) so that the destination has the target file rather than a symlink to the target.
*codice_7 (interactive) – prompts with the name of a file to be overwritten. This occurs if the &quot;TargetDirectory&quot; or &quot;TargetFile&quot; parameter contains a file with the same name as a file specified in the &quot;SourceFile&quot; or &quot;SourceDirectory&quot; parameter. If one enters codice_8 (or the locale&#x27;s equivalent of codice_8), the codice_1 command continues. Any other answer prevents the codice_1 command from overwriting the file.
*codice_12 (no clobbering) – prevents accidentally overwriting any files
*codice_13 (preserve) – the codice_13&quot; flag preserves the following characteristics of each source path in the corresponding target: the time of the &quot;last data modification&quot; and the &quot;time of the last access&quot;, the ownership (only if it has permissions to do this), and the file permission-bits.
*codice_15 or codice_16 (recursive) – copy directories recursively

== Examples ==
Creating a copy of a file in the current directory:
 cp prog.c prog.bak
This copies prog.c to prog.bak. If the prog.bak file does not already exist, the cp command creates it. If it does exist, the cp command replaces its contents with the contents of the prog.c file.

Copy two files in the current directory into another directory:
 cp jones smith /home/nick/clients
This copies the files &quot;jones&quot; to /home/nick/clients/jones and &quot;smith&quot; to /home/nick/clients/smith.

Copy a file to a new file and preserve the modification date, time, and access control list associated with the source file:
 cp -p smith smith.jr
This copies the smith file to the smith.jr file. Instead of creating the file with the current date and time stamp, the system gives the smith.jr file the same date and time as the smith file. The smith.jr file also inherits the smith file&#x27;s access control protection.

Copy a directory, including all its files and subdirectories, to another directory:
 cp -R /home/nick/clients /home/nick/customers
This copies the directory &quot;clients&quot;, including all its files, subdirectories, and the files in those subdirectories, to the directory &quot;customers/clients&quot;. Some Unix systems behave differently in this mode, depending on the termination of directory paths. Using codice_17 on a GNU system it behaves as expected; however, on a BSD system, it copies all the &quot;contents&quot; of the &quot;clients&quot; directory, instead of the directory &quot;clients&quot; itself. The same happens in both GNU and BSD systems if the path of the source directory ends in . or .. (with or without trailing slash).

The copying of a file to an existing file is performed by opening the existing file in update mode, thereby preserving the files inode, which requires write access and results in the target file retaining the permissions it had originally.

<doc id="792898" wikidata="Q5681373" url="?curid=792898" title="Hatfield College, Durham">
<text>Hatfield College is one of the constituent colleges of Durham University in England. It occupies a city centre site above the River Wear on the World Heritage Site peninsula, lying adjacent to North Bailey and only a short distance from Durham Cathedral. Taking its name from a medieval Prince-Bishop of Durham, the college was founded in 1846 as Bishop Hatfield&#x27;s Hall by David Melville, a former Oxford don.

Melville disliked the &#x27;rich living&#x27; of patrician undergraduates at University College, and hoped to nurture a collegiate experience that would be affordable to those of limited means; and in which the students and staff were to be regarded as part of a single community. In line with his ambitions, the college pioneered the concept of catered residences for students, where all meals were taken in the hall, and occupants charged fixed prices for board and lodgings — this system became the norm for Durham colleges, and later on at Oxford and Cambridge, before spreading worldwide.

As the 20th century progressed, Hatfield was increasingly characterised by its irreverent atmosphere among undergraduates, reputation for academic indifference, sporting achievement — especially in rugby — and possessing a high intake of students from English public schools. College administration, on the other hand, preferred to highlight the willingness of students to get involved in a wide variety of university activities; and argued that &#x27;Hatfield man&#x27;, contrary to his reactionary image, had often been at the forefront of significant reform on campus.

College architecture is an eclectic blend of buildings from a variety of styles and periods. The sloping main courtyard contains an eighteenth-century dining hall, the restrained Jacobethan Melville Building (designed by Anthony Salvin), a Victorian Gothic chapel, and the &#x27;inoffensive neo-Georgian&#x27; C Stairs. The trend for revivalist and traditional buildings was disposed of with the modern Jevons Building, located in the college&#x27;s second courtyard, which interprets older forms in a more &#x27;contemporary&#x27; manner.

After many decades as a single-sex institution, the first female undergraduates were formally admitted in Michaelmas term 1988.

== History ==
===Early years===
The establishment of the college in 1846 as a furnished and catered residence with set fees was a revolutionary idea, but later became the general standard for university accommodation in the modern sense: an &quot;arrangement where students would be provided with furnished rooms and meals for a flat fee&quot;. Previously, university students were expected to furnish their rooms themselves. This concept came from the young founding master, David Melville, who believed his model would make a university education more affordable. Essentially, the three principles were that rooms would be furnished and let out to students with shared servants, meals would be provided and eaten in the college hall, and college battels (bills) were set in advance. This system made Hatfield a more economical choice when compared to University College, whose students were generally wealthier, and ensured that student numbers at Hatfield built up steadily. Melville&#x27;s model was introduced to the wider university after an endorsement from the Royal Commission of 1862.

Although not intended as a theological college, for the first 50 years the majority of students tended towards theology, while senior staff members and the principal were in holy orders. Under William Sanday (1876–1883) student numbers rose considerably, prompting a desperate search for extra rooms. It was forced to rent 3 South Bailey (now part of St John&#x27;s College) in 1879 to accommodate them. Though Hatfield was run on the most economical lines, student poverty was a frequent problem. Dr Joseph Fowler, who, apart from his roles as Chaplain and Senior Tutor in the college, acted as Bursar, allowed undergraduates to take on some debt and even loaned them money, often employing rather creative accounting practises in the process. In 1880, a tennis court was installed for the first time, occupying roughly the same space as the current one. In the 1890s, the college purchased Bailey House and the Rectory (despite its name, most previous occupants were laymen) to accommodate more students. As the end of the century drew closer, the balance of undergraduate students rapidly shifted away from theology. In 1900, there were 49 arts students who had matriculated within the previous 3 years, and 20 in theology. By 1904, just 9 theology undergraduates are recorded, compared to 57 in arts.

===Inter-war===

The inter-war period saw a decline in college fortunes. In the first two decades of the 20th century, Hatfield had experienced a sharp fall in numbers. This was caused initially by the decision to isolate science courses at the campus in Newcastle, an increased tendency to train priests at specialised colleges, poor finances, and finally the outbreak of the First World War. For 15 years after 1897, total students in residence numbered above 100. This had fallen to 69 in 1916, 2 in 1917, and to 3 in 1918. After the war finished there was a temporary leap to more than 60 undergraduates, but by 1923 there were just 14 men on the college books. In 1924, a new science department was established in Durham, and this, along with the active recruiting efforts of new Master Arthur Robinson (1923–1940), achieved gains in student numbers. Within five years of Robinson&#x27;s appointment they had quintupled from the low of 1923.

However, the economic crisis of the 1920s created uncertainty. Hatfield had more students than University College yet lacked the facilities, especially kitchens, to accommodate them. University College, on the other hand, was comparatively undersubscribed. To address this, the two colleges effectively amalgamated under the guidance of Angus Macfarlane-Grieve, and all meals were taken together in the Great Hall of University College, while each college retained its own set of officers and clubs. Unhappy with this arrangement, some Hatfielders expressed their separate identity in trivial ways: for example, using a different door to enter the Castle dining hall than the University College students, and, in contrast to the University College contingent – turning to face the High Table during grace.

The political situation in Europe impacted college activities: during one memorable rag week in 1936, Hatfield students staged a mock Nazi procession to the nearby Market Square, with participants dressing in jackboots, brown shirts, and fascist armbands. One of them, Joe Crouch, a fluent German speaker, comically impersonated Adolf Hitler and delivered an impromptu speech to the assembled crowd. In 1938, fears of an impending war resulted in the construction of an air raid shelter, with dons and servants digging trenches in the Master&#x27;s garden (now Dunham Court). Gas masks were issued to college residents. Meanwhile, a recent decline in the number of freshers, and the death that year of John Hall How, the Master of University College, gave rise to rumours that Hatfield would be annexed to its older neighbour.

===World War II===

In October 1939, Hatfielders were barred from their own college when the university decided to use Hatfield as a temporary site for the new Neville&#x27;s Cross College, an institution for training women teachers. Having spent over a decade taking meals in Castle, they would now be prevented from using Hatfield buildings altogether. Without its own buildings and Master, and the issue of the ongoing war, Hatfield was in a poor position to recruit new students, an era later described as the &quot;wilderness years&quot; by college archivist Arthur Moyes.

However, the college received an unexpected new lease of life when the Royal Air Force established short courses at the university for some of its cadets, and soon these cadets made up half of the Hatfield student body. This led the university to postpone plans to merge Hatfield with University College. Plans were revived again in 1943, but met the strong opposition of Hatfield dons, especially Hedley Sparks. In 1946, the centenary year of the college, members formed the Hatfield Association to both represent alumni and demonstrate to the university council that Hatfield was supported.

===Post-war===

The university finally decided that from October 1949, Hatfield would be reestablished as an independent college – with Vindolanda archaeologist Eric Birley (1949–1956) appointed to serve as the new Master. The post-war period saw Hatfield once again faced with the familiar problem of squeezing in a larger student population, as the war had created a growing backlog. More buildings were constructed and refurbished. Moreover, accommodation was acquired away from the main site and the Senior Common Room was established. In 1962, it was decided that a brass plaque should be fixed to the college gates identifying the establishment as &quot;Hatfield College&quot;. Just 24 hours after installation, a group of students from a rival Bailey college were caught trying to remove the plaque as a sporting trophy. In 1963, the college received its first taste of student protest, when a &quot;militant minority group of young gentlemen united under the banner of International Socialism&quot;. Around the same time students voted to boycott formal dinners after a row with Master Thomas Whitworth (1957–1979) over whether or not jeans counted as formal wear.

Reforms were subsequently introduced. Joint standing committees, composed equally of staff and students, were set up to &quot;deliberate almost every conceivable topic&quot; and the undergraduate Senior Man was allowed to take part in meetings of the college&#x27;s governing body. By 1971, a &quot;liberal and balanced&quot; Governing Body had been achieved: consisting of 4 college tutors, 4 elected tutors, 4 delegates from the Junior Common Room, and a representative from the Hatfield Association alumni group. Writing in the same year, a satisfied Whitworth was able to boast of warding off the &quot;mischievous opportunism&quot; of student &quot;exhibitionists&quot;.

===Modern===

The leadership of James Barber (1980–1996) was a period of significant change. Student numbers rose, increasing to over 650 by the time Barber finished his tenure in office. Living out became compulsory for students for at least part of their career, and many existing buildings were either rebuilt or refurbished to make room for students: The Rectory was remodeled, C &amp; D Stairs were refurbished, the Main Hall was repaired, and Jevons&#x27; was redecorated. A Middle Common Room for the postgraduate community was added in Kitchen Stairs. In 1981, the Formal Ball was renamed &#x27;The Lion in Winter&#x27;, which it has been called ever since. More comically, &#x27;C Scales&#x27;, a goldfish, was elected as a member of the JCR in 1982 and put forward as a potential Durham Student Union President. In 1984, the JCR was sued by representatives of the band Mud after a student ruined four speakers by pouring beer into an amplifier during a performance at a college ball.

Hatfield also became co-educational, which at the time was only &#x27;grudgingly accepted&#x27; by the college. In 1985, talk of going mixed was stimulated by the low numbers of applicants selecting Hatfield as their preference, and a recent decline in academic standards – with the college finishing bottom of the results table the previous year. Ignoring threats of hooliganism, the Senior Common Room decided in May of that year to push forward with plans to go mixed. In March 1987, a student referendum was held, with 79.2% voting for the college to remain men only. The Senate decided that, despite the referendum result, the college would in fact go mixed – and the first female undergraduates arrived the following year. The first female Senior Man held the post in 1992. Her election win, by a single vote, prompted some students to declare a mock &#x27;week of mourning&#x27; and walk around the college wearing black arm bands.

==Buildings==
===Main Court===
The oldest part of the college site is likely what is now the dining room, believed to date back to the 17th century. It originally formed part of a town house owned by a wealthy member of local society, and was converted in 1760 into a coaching inn, The Red Lion – a stopping point for coaches travelling between London and Edinburgh. During this time it also hosted concerts, probably featuring the work of composers like Charles Avison and John Garth. In 1799 the old coaching inn reverted to being a private residence. In 1845, it was sold to the university, and emerged as the first component of the newly founded Hatfield College the following year. Much more extensive when first occupied by Hatfield, since then &quot;substantial parts of the building&quot; have been replaced by newer structures. Apart from the dining room, what remains are spaces adjoining it that were once used by travellers, but are now filled by the Senior Common Room (SCR) – formerly a card room – the SCR dining room; and finally, on the higher floors, the &#x27;D Stairs&#x27; student accommodation block, which comprises 13 twin rooms. D Staircase has had a reputation for being haunted by a female spirit, recognisable by the aroma of a distinctive perfume.

At the west end of the dining room is Kitchen Block, which features the main kitchens as well as a small number of student rooms and offices on the higher floors. &#x27;C Stairs&#x27;, holding the C accommodation block, was officially opened in 1932 by Lord Halifax. It replaced an earlier section of the coaching inn used since the founding of the college. Designed by Anthony Salvin, A &amp; B Stairs – also used for undergraduate housing – was completed in 1849 at a cost of £4,000, and was the first purpose-built part of the college. Containing A and B accommodation blocks, it was renamed and rededicated as the Melville Building in 2005 after a £1million refurbishment. Author Josceline Dimbleby, the great-great-granddaughter of David Melville, was invited to perform the ceremony.

The Rectory was acquired in 1897, and is the administrative hub of the college, encompassing as it does the offices of the Master, the Vice-Master &amp; Senior Tutor, the Assistant Senior Tutor, the Chaplain, the Senior Administrative Secretary, the Senior Tutor&#x27;s Secretary, the Finance Officer and the Hatfield Trust/Association. The Birley Room, used for social functions, can be found at the ground floor of the Rectory. Added to the college at the same time as the Rectory, Hatfield Cottage is in between the redundant church of St Mary-le-Bow (now the Durham Museum and Heritage Centre) and Gatehouse Block. It is where the Middle Common Room (MCR) is now located, having moved from its former space in Kitchen Block.

Gatehouse Block is to the right of the entrance and houses the porters&#x27; lodge. It also has single and twin use student rooms. In 1961 the college had begun a project to replace the remnants of a much older gatehouse that was in poor condition. The new pseudo-Georgian replacement was completed by Easter 1962 for a total cost of £55,000. To provide an unbroken front to the North Bailey, decorative gates and railings were installed in the aftermath.

===Dunham Court===

Named after alumnus Kingsley Dunham, Dunham Court is the second quadrangle of the college. Accessed through an underpass by the chapel, it comprises two buildings, Jevons (Frank Jevons) and Pace (Edward Pace). An influx of extra students after the war stimulated demand for more accommodation and the garden of the old Jevon&#x27;s House provided the available space. The new building, described by Pevsner as &quot;friendly&quot;, with a &quot;nice rhythm of windows towards the river&quot;, was finished in 1950 and named after former Vice-Master Edward Pace.

The college commenced the largest building project in its history when it demolished old Jevon&#x27;s House, a &quot;property of advanced decrepitude&quot; once occupied by the bare-knuckle boxer and politician John Gully before its purchase by the university. As parts of the building had become dangerous by this point, the entire structure had to be removed. Construction of the new modernist style Jevons Building, which would complete the new Dunham Court, began in June 1966. It was officially unveiled in a ceremony in June 1968, attended by both Kingsley Dunham and Lord Lieutenant of Durham James Duff. It won a Civic Trust Award the following year. In 1972 a fishpond, since removed, was constructed in the centre of the court at the encouragement of senior college officers.

Both buildings contain rooms and social spaces: the college bar and café is located in Jevons, while Pace has a TV lounge, a music room, a kitchen, two gyms, and the JCR Common Room.

=== Chapel ===

The college chapel was conceived in 1851 and built by 1854, funded by donations by alumni and topped up with a loan of £150 from the university. Designed by Bishop Cosin&#x27;s Hall chaplain, James Turner (also a trained architect), it contains head sculptures of William Van Mildert, the founder of the university, and Warden Thorp, the first Vice-Chancellor.

Commemorative oak panels mark the fallen of the First World War, with a book of remembrance naming those lost in the Second World War. The chapel houses a Harrison &amp; Harrison organ, which is used to accompany services and for recitals. In 2001, it was refurbished at the cost of £65,000.

When Hatfield was founded, attendance at cathedral services was compulsory; and once the chapel was constructed attendance at these services was obligatory for the next 80 years. Since then, the chapel has been described as making up an &quot;important but minority interest&quot; within the college.

Hatfield offers eight choral scholarships annually, after an audition and interview process with the chaplain during first term. The choir is led by a student choral director, supported by an organ scholar and deputy organ scholar. It is mainly made up of students who support regular worship in the chapel, but also sing at other churches and cathedrals, with annual tours undertaken both at home and abroad. A further scholarship, the Matthew Fantom Organ Scholarship, is available to those students in the early stages of learning to play the organ and who would not be ready to apply for the regular organ scholarships.

===Other buildings===
Opposite the gatehouse on North Bailey is Bailey House, an accommodation block which provides 50 single rooms, plus a communal and kitchen area on the ground floor. Palmers Garth is located across the Kingsgate Bridge over the River Wear. It offers 8 twin and 41 single rooms for 57 students. The building was formerly used for administration by the university, and once hosted the careers service until it was handed over to Hatfield College in 1991.

The postgraduate accommodation site is James Barber House, or JBH for short, a self-catered residence on nearby Church Street. Named after former Master James Barber, it was completed by Durham County Council as Palatine House in 1968, and originally a care home for the elderly before its purchase by the college in 2006.

== College traditions ==

=== Arms ===

From its foundation, the college used as its arms the personal shield of Thomas Hatfield (&quot;Azure, a chevron or, between three lions rampant argent&quot;). The crest was made circular in design and was accompanied with the Latin motto &quot;Vel Primus Vel Cum Primis&quot;, which literally means &quot;Either First or With the First&quot;, though is now loosely interpreted by the college as &quot;Be the Best you can Be&quot;.

In 1954, the college learned that its crest was unregistered with the College of Arms, and its display, including the use of Bishop Hatfield&#x27;s shield, was both inappropriate and illegal. Consequently, it sought a grant of its own from the College of Arms, which was approved. The new arms were based on Hatfield&#x27;s shield, but to difference the college&#x27;s arms from the bishop&#x27;s, a crown and plumes above the shield was added, with an ermine border and the college motto scrolled underneath.

This new crest was more &quot;official&quot; looking but tricky to reproduce. Rodney Lucas, a student in the 1950s, was asked to produce freehand drawings of the college arms (one with the crest and one without) for use in the annual &quot;Hatfield Record&quot;. The design without the crest was ultimately chosen and appeared for years on college stationery. In June 1994, Lucas contacted the college with a new rendering of the college arms made on a computer, which was subsequently adopted. The commercial design for the arms was changed once again in 2005.

=== Academic dress ===
Similar to most Bailey Colleges, the wearing of the undergraduate academic gown is required for formal events, including to the matriculation ceremony and all formal dinners held in college.

=== Formals ===
In Michaelmas term (first term), formal dinners are held twice each week, on Tuesday and Friday. Epiphany term (second term) sees this reduced to mainly Fridays, while few formals are held during Easter term (third term) as students&#x27; attention is increasingly focused on exams and assignments. A High table, consisting of senior staff, is also present during formal meals.

Unique to Hatfield is the tradition of &#x27;spooning&#x27;, in which students bang spoons on the edge of the table or on silverware for several minutes before the formal starts. The act immediately ceases when the High Table walks in.

==== Grace ====
This can be translated as:

&quot;Blessed God, who feedest us from our youth, and providest food for all flesh, fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that we, having enough to satisfy us, may abound in every good work, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Spirit, be all honour and praise and power for all ages. Amen.&quot;

Since 1846 the grace has been read at all formal meals in college. It is popular at alumni dinners, where an attempt to read the grace in English was badly received by guests.

Widely used in the fourth century and based on earlier Hebrew prayers, it was translated from the Greek and adopted by Oriel College, Oxford. Hatfield copied it practically verbatim; the college believes this was likely influenced by the Rev. Henry Jenkyns, a Fellow of Oriel before becoming Professor of Greek and Classical Literature at Durham.

===Hatfield Day===
Hatfield Day is a day of festivities held every June to celebrate the end of exams. Traditions include &#x27;Storming the Castle&#x27;, in which Hatfield students wake up early to rush the courtyard of University College and sing college songs.

By the 1980s Hatfield Day was &#x27;not an occasion to which children or maiden aunts could be invited&#x27;. Problems included offensive student pranks, vandalism, and an inability to contain events within the confines of the college. Arrests were not unknown. The Hatfield Day of 1984 required County Durham Fire Brigade to extinguish a fire set by a student.

With the admission of female undergraduates, Hatfield Day became notably &#x27;less coarse&#x27; as women members of JCR now &#x27;exerted an influence&#x27; on behaviour.

===Songs===
The college song was formerly Green Grow the Rushes, O. It was replaced in 1952 with a surprising selection: &#x27;If I Should Plant a Tiny Seed of Love&#x27; by Ballard Macdonald. This &#x27;mournful Edwardian ballad&#x27; came to be the &#x27;rallying song of an increasingly macho Hatfield&#x27;.

As of 2012, other long-established college songs included Two Little Boys, Jerusalem, and Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.

== Student body ==
As of the 2017/18 academic year, Hatfield College has a population of 1,339 students. There are 1,007 full-time undergraduates and 3 part-time undergraduates. Postgraduate figures include 55 students on full-time postgraduate research programs and 111 studying for full-time postgraduate taught programs, plus a further 94 part-time postgraduate students (research and taught) as well as 69 distance learning students.

=== Common rooms ===
The Junior Common Room (JCR) is for undergraduates in the college. It annually elects an executive committee consisting of 10 members, including an impartial chair, who run the JCR in conjunction with college officers. Unlike other colleges, Hatfield exclusively retains Senior Man as its title for the head of the JCR, having rejected a motion to move to &quot;JCR President&quot; in May 2014. A motion to allow the incumbent to choose between &quot;Senior Man&quot;, &quot;Senior Woman&quot; or &quot;Senior Student&quot; was also defeated in January 2016.

The Middle Common Room (MCR) is the organisation for postgraduate students. Postgraduate accommodation is located at James Barber House. College officers, fellows and tutors are members of the Senior Common Room (SCR).

=== Image ===

Having shed its theological image by the Second World War, Hatfield developed a strong sporting reputation over the following decades. Johnathan Young, a 1963 matriculant, later recalled that his contemporaries &#x27;were expected to excel in most sports and particularly rugby&#x27;.

A stereotype of Hatfield undergraduates as indifferent students who were largely from privileged backgrounds also emerged. This was a perception that college leadership were acutely aware of and keen to downplay. Master Thomas Whitworth, in his 1971 college history, &quot;Yellow Sandstone and Mellow Brick&quot;; instead defined Hatfielders by ambition, and stressed their tendency to seek leadership positions on campus. It was a viewpoint echoed years later by his successor, James Barber:

Alumni have also praised a &quot;work hard, play hard ethos&quot; conducive to future success and highlighted a strong sense of identity and community. Nevertheless, student articles have criticised Hatfield for being &#x27;rah&#x27;, and suggested it is responsible for perpetuating negative views about the wider university. Writing in 1996, college archivist Arthur Moyes admitted that modesty &quot;is not a Hatfield characteristic&quot;.

Past data has shown it to be popular with applicants from private schools. For the 2015/2016 cycle, 65.8% of applicants were privately educated – against a university total of only 36.1%. These figures also represent a significant reversal over time; during the 1960s the state school intake averaged 63%.

For 2016 entry, under 2% of freshers were from low participation neighbourhoods. To attract a wider range of candidates it has launched an outreach programme working with pupils in local state schools in Gateshead, Hartlepool, and Washington.

=== Admissions ===
For the 2015/2016 entry cycle 1,375 applicants selected the college as their preference. This made it the 5th most popular overall, behind University College, Josephine Butler College, Collingwood College, and St Mary&#x27;s College. 336 accepted applicants ultimately enrolled. Compared to most other colleges, Hatfield received a somewhat higher percentage of gap year applicants, with 7.8% of applicants in the 2015/2016 cycle choosing to defer, against a university average of 3.8%.

In the application cycles from 2017 through 2020, Hatfield was ranked in the top 5 of colleges by number of first choice preferences, but dropped to 8th place for 2021 entry. That year it was the &#x27;most polarizing college&#x27;, having seen the largest increase in last-place rankings.

By 2012, honorary fellows numbered 24 in total, notably including former university chancellor Bill Bryson.

As of 2018, other staff affiliated to the college include eight junior research fellows and 10 Senior Research Fellows. Current senior fellows include, amongst others, the theologian Douglas Davies. The college also occasionally hosts visiting academics, normally for one term, as part of the fellowship scheme offered by the university&#x27;s Institute of Advanced Study.

== Sports and societies ==

=== Hatfield College Boat Club ===

Hatfield College Boat Club (HCBC) is the boat club of Hatfield College at Durham University. The club was started in 1846, shortly after the founding of the college, making it one of the oldest student clubs in Durham. There is a Novice Development programme for absolute beginners. It also trains coxes and has a dedicated Coxes Captain. 

The club competes in head races and regattas across the country, including the Head of the River Race, Henley Royal Regatta, Durham Regatta, as well as inter-collegiate competitions run by Durham College Rowing.

The current college boathouse was completed in Epiphany term of 1881, with the previous structure having to be rebuilt and re-sited at the cost of £250 – club members believing it to be &#x27;inconveniently small&#x27; and very exposed to flood damage. Up until 2001 Hatfield shared its boat club with rowers from Trevelyan College. Tension over space, resulting from Hatfield&#x27;s desire to purchase additional boats, saw the termination of this arrangement, with Trevelyan later electing to store its boats with the local owner of a private boathouse.

In 2016, the boathouse was one of several to fall victim to racist graffiti and had a swastika and SS symbol splashed on the doors. Major maintenance was carried out in 2019: the roof was reinforced and the doors sanded and repainted.

Notable former members of the club include Alice Freeman, Louisa Reeve, Angus Groom, and Simon Barr.

The boat club&#x27;s alumni society, The White Lion Club, connects current students with alumni at key events throughout the year such as the Head of the River Race, Durham Regatta and the annual Christmas dinner.

HCBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;HAT&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing.

=== Rugby ===
Hatfield College has become known for prowess in rugby in particular – so much so that Thomas Whitworth (Master, 1957–79), a known rugby enthusiast, was often accused of bias in the selection and treatment of rugby-playing students. In intercollegiate rugby, Hatfield became the dominant club in the decades following the war, conceding the colleges cup just once in a 14-year period up to 1971. The Durham University team that triumphed in the 1969 University Athletic Union final against Newcastle University was made up mostly of Hatfield players.

Intercollegiate dominance continued into the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, with Hatfield eventually establishing a record of 30 cup wins in 32 years. The 1995 cup final was noteworthy for being an all-Hatfield event, contested by the college&#x27;s A and B teams. Today, double protein portions for university rugby players are still offered in the college dining hall each meal-time.

Will Carling, Will Greenwood, and Marcus Rose are the most notable former undergraduates, all of whom made multiple appearances for England and participated in various editions of the Rugby World Cup. Richard Breakey and Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton were capped by Scotland, while Mark Griffin won several caps for the United States. Josh Basham, Stuart Legg and Ben Woods have all played club rugby for Newcastle Falcons. Another recent graduate, Fitz Harding, is signed to Bristol Bears.

=== Other sports and societies ===
Hatfield has its own theatre group, the Lion Theatre Company. It has SHAPED, which is a personal development program.

==Alumni==
===Hatfield Trust===
Established in 1987 to get around the financial limitations of being a maintained college, the Hatfield Trust is essentially the college endowment fund. It relies on contributions from alumni and supporters to fund student activities, bursaries, and one-off projects. The value of the trust stood at £500,000 by 1998. As a way to encourage more frequent donations from former students, the 1846 Club enables donors to make pledges of £18.46 annually, quarterly, or monthly.

===Societies===

Hatfield alumni are active through organisations and events, such as the Hatfield Association, which now has a membership of more than 4,000 graduates.

===Notable people===

There are examples of notable alumni of Hatfield College in various fields, including government, academia, arts, and sport to name just a few.

The sporting alumni of Hatfield College may be the most famous, among them former England rugby union captain Will Carling, 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Will Greenwood, and former England cricket team captain Andrew Strauss. More recently, rower Angus Groom was a silver medallist at the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Government figures to have attended Hatfield include Robert Buckland, a former Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor; Edward Timpson, former MP for Eddisbury and Minister of State for Children and Families; and Labour Party life peer Baron Carter of Coles. At least 5 alumni have held ambassadorial level posts in the Foreign Office, most notably Kim Darroch, previously British Ambassador to the United States

Hatfielders in the military include Lord Dannatt, a former Chief of the General Staff, and one of his successors in the same role – General Mark Carleton-Smith. The late Air Marshall Peter Walker, Rear Admiral Andrew Burns, the current Fleet Commander, and retired Rear Admiral Matt Parr were also Hatfield undergraduates, in addition to Major-General Peter Grant Peterkin, later appointed Serjeant at Arms in the House of Commons.
In the media, presenters Jeremy Vine, Mark Durden-Smith, Jonathan Gould, and Mark Pougatch; and David Shukman, Science Editor of BBC News (2012–2021), were all students at the college.

In the arts world, travel writer Alexander Frater was a Hatfield student, as was the poet and memoirist Thomas Blackburn, fashion journalist Colin McDowell, singer-songwriter Jake Thackray, comedian Ed Gamble, and conductor Jonathan Darlington.

Ecclesiastical alumni are numerous: with former Bishop of Derby Peter Dawes, former Bishop of Cyprus and the Gulf Clive Handford, and Morris Gelsthorpe, the first Bishop in the Sudan, making up just a small sample.

In academia, names include computer scientist Keith Clark, Professor of Computational Logic at Imperial College London (1987–2009); particle physicist Nigel Glover, a current professor at Durham; Rebecca Goss, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of St Andrews; and Gordon Cameron, Professor of Land Economy at the University of Cambridge (1980–1990) and Master of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (1988–1990).

Eden Project founder Tim Smit, BP executive Richard Paniguian, Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress, and David Arkless, Chairman of End Human Trafficking Now, are all examples of alumni with a background in business.

<doc id="792915" wikidata="Q327506" url="?curid=792915" title="Glucosamine">
<text>Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of two polysaccharides, chitosan and chitin. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. Produced commercially by the hydrolysis of shellfish exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat, glucosamine has many names depending on country.

Although a common dietary supplement, there is little evidence that it is effective for relief of arthritis or pain, and is not an approved prescription drug in the United States.

==Dietary supplement==
Oral glucosamine is a dietary supplement and is not a prescription drug in the United States. Glucosamine is marketed as a supplement to support the structure and function of joints, and the marketing is targeted to people with osteoarthritis.

Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chondroitin, glucosamine hydrochloride, and &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a &quot;likely effective&quot; rating for treating osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane.

Glucosamine, along with commonly used chondroitin, is not routinely prescribed to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, as there is insufficient evidence that this treatment is helpful.

As is common with heavily promoted dietary supplements, the claimed benefits of glucosamine are based principally on clinical and laboratory studies. Clinical studies on glucosamine efficacy are divided, with some reporting relief from arthritic pain and stiffness, while others report no benefit above placebo.

, there is no evidence that consumption of glucosamine by sport participants prevents or limits joint damage after injury.

==Adverse effects and drug interactions==
Glucosamine with or without chondroitin elevates the international normalized ratio (INR) in individuals who are taking the blood thinner, warfarin. It may also interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy for treating cancer symptoms.

Adverse effects are mild and infrequent and may include stomach upset, constipation, diarrhea, headache, and rash.

Since glucosamine is usually derived from the shells of shellfish, it may be unsafe for those with shellfish allergy. Many manufacturers of glucosamine derived from shellfish include a warning that those with a seafood allergy should consult a healthcare professional before taking the product. Alternatively, non-shellfish-derived forms of glucosamine are available.

Another concern has been that the extra glucosamine could contribute to diabetes by interfering with the normal regulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, but several investigations found no evidence that this occurs. Other studies conducted in lean or obese subjects concluded that oral glucosamine at standard doses does not affect insulin resistance.

==Biochemistry==
Glucosamine is naturally present in the shells of shellfish, animal bones, bone marrow, and fungi.
-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. Specifically in humans, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine by glutamine—fructose-6-phosphate transaminase as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The end-product of this pathway is uridine diphosphate &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids.

As the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate is the first step for the synthesis of these products, glucosamine may be important in regulating their production; however, the way that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is actually regulated, and whether this could be involved in contributing to human disease remains unclear.

==Manufacturing==
Most glucosamine is manufactured by processing chitin from the shells of shellfish including shrimp, lobsters, and crabs. To meet the demands of vegetarians and others with objections to shellfish, manufacturers have brought glucosamine products to market made using fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; and from fermenting corn.

==History==
Glucosamine was first prepared in 1876 by Georg Ledderhose by the hydrolysis of chitin with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The stereochemistry was not fully determined until the 1939 work of Walter Haworth.

== Legal status ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use in humans. Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, evidence of safety is required by FDA regulations, but evidence of efficacy is not required so long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition.

In 2004, the FDA declared there was insufficient evidence for supplement manufacturers to state that glucosamine was effective for treating arthritis, joint degeneration, or cartilage deterioration, a position remaining in effect as of 2018.

=== Europe ===
In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate. In this case, evidence of safety and efficacy is required for the medical use of glucosamine and several guidelines have recommended its use as an effective and safe therapy for osteoarthritis.

The Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee has granted glucosamine sulfate a level of toxicity of 5 in a 0-100 scale, and recent OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) guidelines for hip and knee osteoarthritis indicate an acceptable safety profile. By 2014, the OARSI did not recommend glucosamine for disease modification, and considered it &quot;uncertain&quot; for symptom relief, in knee osteoarthritis.

=== Class-action lawsuits ===
In 2013, without admitting fault, manufacturer Rexall Sundown and NBTY agreed to pay up to to settle consumer claims related to the wording of certain claims on the packaging of glucosamine bottles sold at Costco under the Kirkland label.

In August 2012, a class-action lawsuit was filed in New York claiming that 21st Century Healthcare, Inc. had falsely advertised that its &quot;Glucosamine 750 Chondroitin 600 Triple Strength&quot; dietary supplements would restore lost cartilage. In April 2013, a San Diego man launched a proposed class-action lawsuit in California Federal Court accusing Nutramax Laboratories, Walmart and Rite Aid of falsely advertising the effectiveness of glucosamine.

==Research==

===Humans===
Because glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of cartilage, research has focused on the potential for supplemental glucosamine to improve cartilage structure and alleviate arthritis, but there is little evidence from clinical trials that it is effective for alleviating arthritis pain.

Two studies measured the concentrations of glucosamine in the synovial fluid and plasma after oral administration of glucosamine sulfate to both healthy volunteers and people with osteoarthritis.

In the first study, glucosamine sulfate was given to healthy volunteers in doses of 750, 1,500, or 3,000 mg once daily. In the second study, oral glucosamine sulfate capsules (1,500 mg) were given daily for two weeks to 12 people with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and synovial fluid increased significantly from baseline levels, and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to articular cartilage, but the levels are still ten to one hundred times lower than required to positively influence the cartilage (chondrocytes) to build new tissue. Glucosamine sulfate uptake in synovial fluid may be as much as 20%, or it could be negligible, indicating no biological significance.

==Veterinary medicine==

===Dogs===
Some studies have shown efficacy of glucosamine supplementation for dogs with osteoarthritis pain, particularly in combination with other nutraceuticals like chondroitin, while others have not. A trial of oral combination capsules (glucosamine, chondroitin, and manganese ascorbate) in dogs with osteoarthritis found no benefit on either gait analysis or subjective assessments by the veterinarian or owner.

===Horses===
The use of glucosamine in equine medicine exists, but one meta-analysis judged extant research too flawed to be of value in guiding treatment of horses.

A number of studies have measured the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (9 g) with or without chondroitin sulfate (3 g) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9–15 μmol/L following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3–0.7 μmol/L with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 times lower than that required to have a positive effect on the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow-up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20 mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158 ng/mL compared to 89 ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.

A three-month trial of an oral dosage regime of a commercial preparation of glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane was performed in veteran horses with no effect on gait stiffness, with exercise alone in the control group being effective. The intravenous use of a combination of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine, pentosan polysulfate and sodium hyaluronate in horses with surgically-induced osteoarthritis saw improvements in X-ray changes to the cartilage but not histologically or in biochemical outcomes, suggesting more evidence is needed for this combination and route of administration.

<doc id="792934" wikidata="Q7978402" url="?curid=792934" title="Textiles in folklore">
<text>Mention of textiles in folklore is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art. Textiles have also been associated in several cultures with spiders in mythology.

Weaving begins with spinning. Until the spinning wheel was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with distaff and spindle. In English the &quot;distaff side&quot; indicates relatives through one&#x27;s mother, and thereby denotes a woman&#x27;s role in the household economy. In Scandinavia, the stars of Orion&#x27;s belt are known as &quot;Friggjar rockr&quot;, &quot;Frigg’s distaff&quot;.

The spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler&#x27;s eighth-century BCE inscription at Karatepe:
&quot;In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles&quot;

In the adjacent region of North Syria, historian Robin Lane Fox remarks funerary stelae showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.

==Egypt==
In pre-Dynastic Egypt, &quot;nt&quot; (Neith) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. According to E. A. Wallis Budge (&quot;The Gods of the Egyptians&quot;) the root of the word for &quot;weaving&quot; and also for &quot;being&quot; are the same: &quot;nnt&quot;.

Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary (1897) refers to numerous Biblical references to weaving:

==Greece==
In Greek mythology, the Moirai (the &quot;Fates&quot;) are the three crones who control destiny, by spinning the thread of life on the distaff. Ariadne, princess of Minoan Crete and later the wife of the god Dionysus, possessed the spun thread that led Theseus to the center of the labyrinth and safely out again.

Among the Olympians, the weaver goddess is Athena, who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte Arachne, whom Athena in retribution turned into a weaving spider. The daughters of Minyas, Alcithoe, Leuconoe and their sister, defied Dionysus and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven peplos, laid upon the knees of the goddess&#x27;s iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and Hera.

In Homer&#x27;s legend of the Odyssey, Penelope the faithful wife of Odysseus was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope&#x27;s weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Circe and Calypso. Helen is at her loom in the &quot;Iliad&quot; to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.

Homer dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.

In Roman literature, Ovid in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of Philomela, who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister Procne may understand and the women may take their revenge. The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: Jane Ellen Harrison led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.

==Germanic==
For the Norse peoples, Frigg is a goddess associated with weaving. The Old Norse Darraðarljóð, quoted in Njals Saga, gives a detailed description of valkyries as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the Pre-Roman Iron Age Dejbjerg wagon, a composite of two wagons found ritually deposited in a peat bog in Dejbjerg, Jutland, and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.

In Germanic later mythology, Holda (Frau Holle) and Perchta (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.

Holda, whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women&#x27;s fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making linen from flax. An account of Holda was collected by the Brothers Grimm, as the fairy tale &quot;Frau Holda&quot;. Another of the Grimm tales, &quot;Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle&quot;, which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:
:&quot;Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,&quot;
:&quot;and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.&quot;

::&quot;&quot;Spindel, Spindel, geh&#x27; du aus,&quot;
::&quot;bring den Freier in mein Haus.&quot;&quot;

This tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl&#x27;s hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as Theseus followed the thread of Ariadne, to find what he was seeking: a bride &quot;who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest&quot;. He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.

Jacob Grimm reported the superstition &quot;if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way.&quot; (&quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot; 1835, v3.135)

==Celts==

The goddess Brigantia, due to her identification with the Roman Minerva, may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.

==French==
Weavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century Jean d&#x27;Arras, a Northern French storyteller (&quot;trouvere&quot;), assembled a collection of stories entitled &quot;Les Évangiles des Quenouilles&quot; (&quot;Spinners&#x27; Tales&quot;). Its frame story is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.

==Baltic==
In Baltic myth, Saule is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.

==Finnish==
The Finnish epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.

==Later European folklore==
&quot;When Adam delved and Eve span...&quot; runs the rhyme; though the tradition that Eve span is unattested in Genesis, it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an illumination from the 13th-century Hunterian Psalter (&quot;illustration. left&quot;) Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.

In later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic. Mother Goose, traditional teller of fairy tales, is often associated with spinning. She was known as &quot;Goose-Footed Bertha&quot; or &quot;Reine Pédauque&quot; (&quot;Goose-footed Queen&quot;) in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.

The daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon Rumpelstiltskin was an old tale when the Brothers Grimm collected it. Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale &quot;The Three Spinners&quot; is aided by three mysterious old women. In &quot;The Six Swans&quot;, the heroine spins and weaves starwort in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse. &quot;Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle&quot; are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine. Sleeping Beauty, in all her forms, pricks her finger on a spindle, and the curse falls on her.

In Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped Elaine of Astolat, whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. William Holman Hunt&#x27;s painting from the poem (&quot;illustration, right&quot;) contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth (&quot;Hesperides&quot;) and Religion (&quot;Prayer&quot;) echo the mirror&#x27;s open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings &quot;&#x27;Tirra lirra&#x27; by the river&quot; as in Tennyson&#x27;s poem.

A high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet &quot;weaver of peace&quot;, linking the woman&#x27;s art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem &quot;Widsith&quot;, who &quot;had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker...&quot;

==Inca==
In Inca mythology, Mama Ocllo first taught women the art of spinning thread.

==China==
*In Tang dynasty China, the goddess weaver floated down on a shaft of moonlight with her two attendants. She showed the upright court official &quot;Guo Han&quot; in his garden that a goddess&#x27;s robe is seamless, for it is woven without the use of needle and thread, entirely on the loom. The phrase &quot;a goddess&#x27;s robe is seamless&quot; passed into an idiom to express perfect workmanship. This idiom is also used to mean a perfect, comprehensive plan.
*The Goddess Weaver, daughter of the Celestial Queen Mother and Jade Emperor, wove the stars and their light, known as &quot;the Silver River&quot; (what Westerners call &quot;The Milky Way Galaxy&quot;), for heaven and earth. She was identified with the star Westerners know as Vega. In a 4,000-year-old legend, she came down from the Celestial Court and fell in love with the mortal Buffalo Boy (or Cowherd), (associated with the star Altair). The Celestial Queen Mother was jealous and separated the lovers, but the Goddess Weaver stopped weaving the Silver River, which threatened heaven and earth with darkness. The lovers were separated, but are able to meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh moon.

==Japan==
* The Japanese folktale &quot;Tsuru no Ongaeshi&quot; features a weaving theme. A crane, rescued by a childless elderly couple, appears to them in the guise of a girl who cares for them out of gratitude for their kindness and is adopted as their daughter. She secretly begins weaving stunningly beautiful cloth for the couple to sell under the condition that they may not see her weave. Though the couple initially comply, they are overcome with curiosity and find the girl is the crane who has been weaving the cloth from her own feathers, leaving her in a pitiful state. With her identity discovered, she must leave the remorseful couple. A variation of the story replaces the elderly couple with a man, who marries the crane when she takes on the form of a young woman.

==Christian hagiography==

Multiple individuals have been designated as patron saints of various aspects of textile work. The mythology and folklore surrounding their patronage can be found in their respective hagiographies.

<text>A laser guide star is an artificial star image created for use in astronomical adaptive optics systems, which are employed in large telescopes in order to correct atmospheric distortion of light (called &quot;astronomical seeing&quot;). Adaptive optics (AO) systems require a wavefront reference source of light called a guide star. Natural stars can serve as point sources for this purpose, but sufficiently bright stars are not available in all parts of the sky, which greatly limits the usefulness of natural guide star adaptive optics. Instead, one can create an artificial guide star by shining a laser into the atmosphere. Light from the beam is reflected by components in the upper atmosphere back into the telescope. This star can be positioned anywhere the telescope desires to point, opening up much greater amounts of the sky to adaptive optics.

Because the laser beam is deflected by astronomical seeing on the way up, the returning laser light does not move around in the sky as astronomical sources do. In order to keep astronomical images steady, a natural star nearby in the sky must be monitored in order that the motion of the laser guide star can be subtracted using a tip-tilt mirror. However, this star can be much fainter than is required for natural guide star adaptive optics because it is used to measure only tip and tilt, and all higher-order distortions are measured with the laser guide star. This means that many more stars are suitable, and a correspondingly larger fraction of the sky is accessible.

==Types==

There are two main types of laser guide star system, known as sodium and Rayleigh beacon guide stars.

Sodium beacons are created by using a laser tuned to 589.2 nanometers to energize atoms in the sodium layer of the mesosphere at an altitude of around . The sodium atoms then re-emit the laser light, producing a glowing artificial star. The same atomic transition of sodium is used in sodium-vapor lamps for street lighting.

Rayleigh beacons rely on the scattering of light by the molecules in the lower atmosphere. In contrast to sodium beacons, Rayleigh beacons are much simpler and less costly, but do not provide as good a wavefront reference, since the artificial beacon is generated much lower in the atmosphere. The lasers are often pulsed, with measurement of the atmosphere being time-gated (taking place several microseconds after the pulse has been launched, so that scattered light at ground level is ignored and only light that has traveled for several microseconds high up into the atmosphere and back is actually detected).

==Laser development==
Dye lasers were the first laser sources used in laser guide star applications. These tunable lasers have continued to play a significant role in this field. However, the use of fluid gain media has been considered by some researchers as disadvantageous. Second generation laser sources for sodium guide star applications include sum-frequency-mixed solid-state lasers. New third generation laser systems based on tunable diode lasers with subsequent narrow-band Raman fiber amplification and resonant frequency conversion have been under development since 2005. Since 2014 fully engineered systems are commercially available. Important output features of the tunable lasers mentioned here include diffraction-limited beam divergence and narrow-linewidth emission.

== Progress ==

The sodium laser guide star for use in adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric distortions is believed to have been invented by Princeton physicist Will Happer in 1982, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, but it was classified at the time.

Laser guide star adaptive optics is still a very young field, with much effort currently invested in technology development. As of 2006, only two laser guide star AO systems were regularly used for science observations and have contributed to published results in peer-reviewed scientific literature: those at the Lick and Palomar Observatories in California, and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. However, laser guide star systems were under development at most major telescopes, with the William Herschel Telescope, Very Large Telescope and Gemini North having tested lasers on the sky but not yet achieved regular operations. Other observatories developing laser AO systems as of 2006 include the Large Binocular Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias. The laser guide star system at the Very Large Telescope started regular scientific operations in June 2007.

Since April 2016, the 4 Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) has been installed at the ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope (VLT), as a new subsystem of the Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF). The 4LGSF is a complement of the VLT Laser Guide Star Facility (LGSF). Instead of a single laser beam, the 4LGSF propagates four laser beams into the skies of Paranal, in northern Chile, producing four artificial stars by illuminating sodium atoms located in the atmosphere at 90 km altitude. These four stars enable getting a better correction in a specific direction, or widening the field of view corrected by an adaptive optics. Each laser delivers 22 watts in a diameter of . The 4LGSF Laser System is based on a fiber Raman laser technology, developed at ESO and transferred to industry.

The upgrade to four lasers with fiber Raman laser technology is necessary to support the new instruments at Paranal Observatory, like HAWK-I (with GRAAL) and MUSE (with GALACSI). Also with the 4LGSF the stability is increased, the amount of preventative maintenance support and the preparation of an observing run time will be considerably reduced compared to the LGSF, which currently still uses its original dye laser (planned to be replaced by a fiber laser).
The 4LGSF helps astronomers to test devices for the E-ELT, which will have a similar system to support the adaptive optics of the telescope.
Given its power, the 4LGSF operations follow a protocol to avoid any risk. The laser system is equipped with an automatic aircraft avoidance system that shuts down the lasers if an aircraft ventures too close to the beams.

For sodium laser guide stars, there are three main challenges to overcome: Larmor precession, recoil, and transition saturation. Larmor precession, which is the precession of the sodium atom in the geomagnetic field (precisely, it is the precession of the quantized total atomic angular momentum vector of the atom), decreases the atomic fluorescence of the laser guide star by changing the angular momentum of the atom before a two-level cycling transition can be established through optical pumping with circularly polarized light. Recoil from spontaneous emission, resulting in a momentum kick to the atom, causes a redshift in the laser light relative to the atom, rendering the atom unable to absorb the laser light and thus unable to fluoresce. Transition saturation is the depopulation of atoms from a state of higher angular momentum (F=2) to a state of lower angular momentum (F=1), resulting in a different absorption wavelength.

<doc id="792966" wikidata="Q3881521" url="?curid=792966" title="Old Man of Coniston">
<text>The Old Man of Coniston is a fell in the Furness Fells of the Lake District in Cumbria, England, and is the highest point (county top) of the historic county of Lancashire. It is at least high, and lies to the west of the village of Coniston and the lake, Coniston Water. The fell is sometimes known by the alternative name of Coniston Old Man, or simply The Old Man. The mountain is popular with tourists and fell-walkers with a number of well-marked paths to the summit. The mountain has also seen extensive copper and slate mining activity for eight hundred years, and the remains of abandoned mines and spoil tips are a significant feature of the north-east slopes.

==Height==
A detailed survey on 24 May 2018 measured the height of the highest visible natural ground to be . The height of the ground on the summit plinth (man-made ground) is .

The same survey also measured the height of nearby Swirl How, and measured it to be also . The measurements were reported with a measurement uncertainty of plus or minus 

The surveyors state: &quot;If one considers the area covered by the plinth on Coniston Old Man and the observation that the highest rock is probably covered by it then we believe the evidence strongly suggests there is higher ground beneath it and that, therefore, Coniston Old Man should retain its current status&quot; [as being the highest of the Furness Fells and the county top of historic Lancashire].

As of 2020, Ordnance Survey maps show the Old Man of Coniston with a height of , and Swirl How at , which makes the Old Man the highest point in the Furness Fells, and the 12th most prominent mountain in England.

==Topography==
The Coniston (or Furness) Fells form the watershed between Coniston Water in the east and the Duddon valley to the west. The range begins in the north at Wrynose Pass and runs south for around before petering out at Broughton in Furness on the Duddon Estuary. Alfred Wainwright in his influential &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot; took only the northern half of the range as Lakeland proper, consigning the lower hills southward to a supplementary work &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot;. Later guidebook writers have chosen to include the whole range in their main volumes.

The central part of the Coniston range can be likened to an inverted &#x27;Y&#x27;, with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs, and south-west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit of the Old Man before tumbling away south-eastward to the valley floor. This ridge-end position gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.

To the west is the deep trench containing Goat&#x27;s Water. This elongated tarn has a depth of about and contains trout and char. Enclosed by high ground, it has an outlet to the south through a field of boulders. This is one of the headwaters of Torver Beck, which passes a disused quarry near the Tranearth climbing hut, keeping the workings topped up via an artificial but picturesque waterfall. The stream finally issues into Coniston Water south of Torver village.

The southern and eastern flanks of the Old Man are composed of rough ground, deeply pockmarked by slate quarries. One of these quarries, Bursting Stone, is still operating and produces an olive-green slate. Across the southern slopes runs the Walna Scar Road. This was the original trade route between Coniston village and the settlements of the Duddon Valley, and is a public restricted byway.
The first section rising steeply from Coniston is a metalled road, maintained partly to provide access to the quarry. This leads to a car park at an altitude of , a popular starting point for climbs. Beyond here motor vehicles are prohibited, but the track continues to its summit at , crossing the ridge to the south of Dow Crag.

Coniston Old Man has no connecting ridges other than that to Brim Fell, but a discernible rib falls due east via Stubthwaite Crag and Crowberry Haws. Below the tourist route path, this rib climbs again to The Bell, a fine rocky top () with excellent views of the lake and village.

Nestling beneath the northern face of the Old Man, and cradled between it and Raven&#x27;s Tor, is Low Water. This corrie tarn has been dammed in the past to provide water for the quarries, but all of its water now issues via a cascade of falls into the Coppermines Valley. This area, shared with the neighbouring fells of Brim Fell and Wetherlam, is heavily scarred by historic copper, nickel and cobalt mining, particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.

==Summit==

The summit of the fell carries a unique construction, a combined slate platform and cairn. The extensive view from the summit on a clear day includes much of the southern Lake District, Morecambe Bay, Blackpool Tower, Winter Hill in the Pennines, the Lancashire coast and the Isle of Man. Perhaps the highlight is the close-up view of Dow Crag.

==Ascents==
The fell is normally climbed from Coniston village via Church Beck and the mines. Alternatives include the south ridge and the path to Goat&#x27;s Water, both ascending from the Walna Scar Road. The car park at the top of the metalled section provides a headstart for these routes. The Walna Scar Road can also be reached from Torver, or from Seathwaite in the Duddon Valley, although the latter results in an indirect climb via Dow Crag.

==Mining==
Coniston copper mines are reputed to be some of the largest copper mines in Britain, with a vertical distance of around . On the Coniston Old Man itself, slate replaced copper, and over several hundred years, the Old Man slate quarries and mines became some of the largest in England. 
The Old Man slate quarries were believed to have started in the 12th and 13th centuries, although there is little evidence on site of this. By the 1500s the quarries, working a kind of volcanic slate silver-grey in colour, were well established. The earliest major working shortly after this period was probably at Low Water Quarry, where opencast slate was prised from cuttings near the summit; Scald Kop Quarry, where a large cavern was formed from slate extraction on the surface; and the Saddlestone Quarry, again consisting of two &#x27;caves&#x27; where slate had been quarried to form underground workings.

==Geology==
The Old Man is within the outcrop of the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group. A band of the dacitic lapilli-tuffs of the Lag Bank Formation crosses the summit. The southern slopes show the volcaniclastic sandstones of the Seathwaite Fell Formation, while the rhyolitic tuffs of the Paddy End Member stretch from north of the summit toward the Coppermines.

==Influence==
The Aetherius Society considers it to be one of its 19 holy mountains.

The Old Man of Coniston is the inspiration for the so-called &quot;Kanchenjunga&quot;, the Lake District mountain Arthur Ransome&#x27;s Swallows and Amazons climb in the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; novel &quot;Swallowdale&quot;. The slate quarries and copper mines inspired &quot;Pigeon Post&quot;, a later novel in the same series. The Old Man of Coniston is also a principal location in the 2020 fantasy young adult novel &quot;The Left-Handed Booksellers of London&quot; by Garth Nix.

<text>Bertil Lindblad (26 November 1895 – 25 June 1965) was a Swedish astronomer.

After finishing his secondary education at Örebro högre allmänna läroverk, Lindblad matriculated at Uppsala University in 1914. He received his &quot;filosofie magister&quot; degree in 1917, his &quot;filosofie licentiat&quot; degree in 1918 and completed his doctorate and became a docent at the university in 1920. From 1927 he was professor and astronomer of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and head of the Stockholm Observatory. In the latter capacity he was responsible for the observatory&#x27;s move from the old building
in the centre of Stockholm to a newly built facility in Saltsjöbaden Observatory, which was opened in 1931.

Lindblad studied the theory of the rotation of galaxies. By making careful observations of the apparent motions of stars, he was able to study the rotation of the Milky Way. He deduced that the rate of rotation of the stars in the outer part of the galaxy, where the Sun is located, decreased with distance from the galactic core. This deduction was soon confirmed by Jan Oort in 1927. A certain
class of resonances in rotating stellar or gaseous disks are named Lindblad resonances, after Bertil Lindblad.

His son, Per Olof Lindblad, also became an astronomer.

<doc id="793000" wikidata="Q4992649" url="?curid=793000" title="The Good Old Days (British TV series)">
<text>The Good Old Days is a BBC television light entertainment programme produced by Barney Colehan which ran for 30 years from 20 July 1953 to 31 December 1983.

It was performed at the Leeds City Varieties and recreated an authentic atmosphere of the Victorian–Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed in the style of the original artistes.

The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing, especially &quot;Down at the Old Bull and Bush&quot; which closed the show each week. The show was compered throughout its whole run (except for the first two shows) by Leonard Sachs, who introduced the acts from a desk situated at the side of the stage. In the course of its run it featured about 2,000 performers. Each show was up to an hour long.

==History==
Early in 1953 Barney Colehan devised a one-off show entitled &quot;The Story of the Music Hall&quot; presented by Deryck Guyler. The programme proved so popular that it was decided to create a series under the title of &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

The show was first broadcast on 20 July 1953 and the first two shows were compered by Don Gemmell. Early series of the show were broadcast live. The show included many regulars such as 
Joan Sterndale-Bennett, Tessie O&#x27;Shea,
, Hattie Jacques, Ray Alan, Roy Castle, Roy Hudd, Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Eartha Kitt, Danny La Rue, Hylda Baker, Les Dawson, Larry Grayson, Tommy Steele, Frankie Vaughan, John Inman, Bernard Cribbins and Arthur Askey.

&quot;The Good Old Days&quot; was inspired by the success of the &quot;Ridgeway&#x27;s Late Joys&quot; at the Players&#x27; Theatre Club in London: a private members&#x27; club that ran fortnightly programmes of variety acts in London&#x27;s West End. The club was originally founded by Leonard Sachs and business partner Peter Ridgeway.

Out of 245 episodes, 108 are believed to survive complete in the archives; 63 of the surviving programmes were rebroadcast on BBC Four between December 2015 and February 2018.

On 16 December 1983, &quot;Goodbye to the Good Old Days&quot; was shown, a documentary celebrating the end of the 30-year run that year; Barry Cryer served as narrator for the documentary. The final show aired on New Year&#x27;s Eve that year.

<doc id="793009" wikidata="Q1777816" url="?curid=793009" title="Mills' Mess">
<text>In toss juggling, Mills&#x27; Mess is a popular juggling pattern, typically performed with three balls although the props used and the number of objects can be different. The pattern was invented by and named after Steve Mills. It is a well-known trick among jugglers and learning it is considered somewhat of a milestone, &quot;a mind-boggling pattern of circling balls, crossing and uncrossing hands, and unexpected catches.&quot; 

The base of this pattern is a traditional reverse cascade, (siteswap 3 in siteswap notation), with an extra &quot;mess&quot; added by crossing and uncrossing arms. The effect created is that the balls pursue each other from one side to the other. It is also a windmill pattern which changes direction every three throws.

== Modern origin ==

Mills Mess was invented in the early 1970s (Between 1974 and 1975). Steve Mills was experimenting with many different variations that his teacher Ron Graham, Ron Lubman and a few others were doing in Central Park. Steve was inspired to do a two-handed variation of a crossing of the arm trick performed by Ron Lubman. Steve invented the trick while attempting to transition smoothly from right-handed windmill to left-handed windmill. About the naming of the trick Steve Mills adds: &quot;The pattern received its name from fellow jugglers at the 1976 International Juggling Convention in Los Angeles, California. Steve Mills did not know how to &quot;teach&quot; this pattern and while trying different methods of teaching this pattern with many proficient jugglers, they shouted &#x27;this is a mess.&#x27;&quot; Mills did not know this was being called &quot;Mills Mess&quot; around the world for several years.

==Variants==
Mills Mess can be combined with chops, claws, or other juggling maneuvers or flourishes to create a pattern that is moderately more difficult than the traditional three-ball cascade. Though most commonly performed with balls, bean-bags or similar objects, the pattern is adaptable to rings, clubs, torches and a variety of other juggling props. Four-, five-, and (recently) six- and seven-ball variations of these patterns have also been performed, as well as four, five and six clubs.

===Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge===

Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge is a heavily embellished and distorted Mills Mess. It is one of the most famous Mills Mess variations.

===Boston Mess===

The Boston Mess is a variant of Mills Mess in which the arms similarly cross and uncross, but the balls are thrown in columns. It is performed with three balls in a columnar cascade pattern (siteswap 3). Cherry Picking is a variant of the Boston Mess in which every catch from one hand is clawed. The Boston Mess was named that by an anonymous 20 year old juggler from Kansas City who demonstrated his trick, which he had previously called &quot;skyscrapers,&quot; for a group of jugglers in Harvard Yard on July 5, 1988.

===Eric&#x27;s Extension===

Eric&#x27;s Extension, invented by Eric Uhrhane, is a variation on Mills Mess in which the arms cross twice on each side instead of just once. The extra throws may add to the visual appeal of the pattern. Eric&#x27;s Extension requires the juggler&#x27;s arms to be slender or flexible to cross two times, a requirement which makes this variation physically impossible for some. It is especially difficult with clubs.

===Inside Out===

When combined with chops (a &quot;chop&quot; is a downward sweep or flourish of the hand that has just caught and is holding a ball), the Mills Mess pattern is sometimes called &quot;Inside Out&quot; -- from its appearance when performed: alternate chops alternating from &quot;inside the pattern&quot; to &quot;outside the pattern&quot;, making it seem almost as if the balls are juggling the hands. The effect is that of a juggler frantically pursuing the balls in their staccato movements. The American artist, Glenn (with no last name) aka &quot;The Great Bongo&quot;, gave this pattern its name, and claims to have taught hundreds of jugglers &quot;how to do it the easy way.&quot;

===Siteswaps===

Mills Mess is a shape distortion involving crossing and uncrossing arm movement, which is independent of the siteswap being performed. Any siteswap with any number of objects can, in theory, be done in Mills Mess. It is merely a distortion of the pattern&#x27;s shape. The standard Mills Mess has the siteswap 3, but Mills Messes of 441, 531 (tower), 534 (four props) and many others have also been performed. The three ball 51 (the shower), 423, 414 (half box), 315, and 612 (see-saw), as well as the four prop 4 (columns or fountain), 534, 552, and the five prop cascade, 5, may have the Mills Mess shape distortion imposed upon them with varying degrees of difficulty.

<doc id="793017" wikidata="Q465729" url="?curid=793017" title="Ernest William Brown">
<text>Ernest William Brown FRS (29 November 1866 – 22 July 1938) was an English mathematician and astronomer, who spent the majority of his career working in the United States and became a naturalised American citizen in 1923.

His life&#x27;s work was the study of the Moon&#x27;s motion (lunar theory) and the compilation of extremely accurate lunar tables. He also studied the motion of the planets and calculated the orbits of Trojan asteroids.

==Life and career==
Brown was born in Hull, England, the second of four children of William and Emma Brown (née Martin). His father was originally a farmer and later became a timber merchant. His mother and younger brother died of scarlet fever in 1870, when Brown was not quite 4 years old. He and his two sisters were then looked after by a maiden aunt, until his father remarried five years later.

===Education and early career===
Brown was educated at Totteridge Park School, Hertfordshire (now part of Dorset House School) and Hull and East Riding College. After leaving school, he entered Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours as sixth Wrangler in mathematics in 1887. He continued with post-graduate studies at Cambridge and worked under the direction of George Howard Darwin. In the summer of 1888, Darwin suggested that he study the papers of George William Hill on the lunar theory. As it turned out, this idea for a line of research was to have a major impact on the remainder of Brown&#x27;s life.

Brown was made a fellow of Christ&#x27;s College in 1889 and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in the same year. He received his master&#x27;s degree in 1891 and then left Cambridge to take up a place as a mathematics instructor at Haverford College, Pennsylvania. There, he rose rapidly to the position of Professor of Mathematics in 1893. However, he continued most years to return to Cambridge during the summer, often staying with his old tutor, Darwin.

===Work on the motion of the Moon===
At Haverford, Brown continued with his studies of the lunar theory, and made a thorough review of the work of earlier researchers, such as Hill, de Pontécoulant, Delaunay and Hansen. His mastery of the field was shown by the publication of his first great work, &quot;An Introductory Treatise on the Lunar Theory&quot;, in 1896, when Brown was still less than 30 years of age. The following year, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society.

As Brown&#x27;s work progressed, he gradually evolved a plan to create a completely new lunar theory. This was eventually published as a series of papers in the &quot;Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; between 1897 and 1908. In 1907, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Yale University, with which he secured an agreement for funding the massive task of calculating detailed tables of the Moon&#x27;s motion, based on his lunar theory. After a period of 12 years and a cost of over $34,000, Brown&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Tables of the Motion of the Moon&quot;, was published in 1919.

===Discrepancies between theory and observation===
Brown&#x27;s objective had been to produce an accurate ephemeris of the Moon, based purely on gravitational theory. For the &#x27;main problem&#x27; of the Earth-Moon-Sun system, he calculated terms in longitude and latitude down to an uncertainty of 0.001 arcseconds. He also included perturbations due to the other planets (principally Jupiter and Venus) and also accounted for the more difficult problem of the non-spherical nature of the Earth and Moon.

Observations showed that Brown&#x27;s tables were indeed superior to those of Hansen, which had been in use since 1857, but there was still a large unexplained fluctuation in the Moon&#x27;s mean longitude of the order of 10 arcseconds. A &#x27;great empirical term&#x27;, of magnitude 10.71 arcseconds and period 257 years, was introduced to eliminate this as far as possible. Given the precision of Brown&#x27;s calculations, it must have come as a great disappointment to have to introduce this arbitrary adjustment.

It had been discovered by Edmond Halley over two centuries previously that the Moon&#x27;s motion appeared to be gradually speeding up. This &#x27;secular acceleration&#x27; could not be explained by gravitational theory alone, and it had been suggested by Simon Newcomb that it was in fact due to a gradual deceleration of the Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation, due to friction generated by the tides. The implication of this was that it was not the Moon that was speeding up – it was time (as measured in terms of Earth&#x27;s increasingly long day) that &quot;appeared&quot; to be slowing down.

Brown devoted much study to this problem and proposed it should be attacked observationally, using lunar occultations to map the Moon&#x27;s path more precisely. He also reasoned that, if the discrepancies were caused by variations in the Earth&#x27;s rotation, it implied that observations of other objects would be similarly affected. This was partially verified by observations of transits of Mercury, but Brown was initially not convinced. However, he eventually concluded that Newcomb was right, and not only was the Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation slowing, but also there were random, unpredictable fluctuations, and he published these findings in a paper in 1926. Later work has shown this to be true, and astronomers now make a distinction between Universal Time, which is based on the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and Terrestrial Time (formerly Ephemeris time), which is a uniform measure of the passage of time (see also ΔT).

===Later work and collaborations===
Brown was an active member of the American Mathematical Society and served as its president from 1915 to 1916.

He retained his professorship at Yale until he retired in 1932. As well as continuing his work on the Moon, he also worked on the motion of the planets around the Sun. In 1933, he published the book, &quot;Planetary Theory&quot;, co-authored with Clarence Shook, which contained a detailed exposition of resonance in planetary orbits and examined the special case of the Trojan asteroids. In 1937, he was awarded the Watson Medal by the US National Academy of Sciences.

One of Brown&#x27;s post-graduate pupils was Wallace John Eckert, who became an instructor at Columbia University while finishing his doctorate. Eckert would improve the pace of astronomical calculations by automating them with digital computers.

===Private life===

Brown never married, and for most of his adult life lived with his unmarried younger sister, Mildred, who kept house for him. She made it her job to shield him from &quot;cares and disturbances&quot; and succeeded in &quot;utterly spoiling him.&quot; In his youth, he was a keen rower and mountaineer. He was a capable pianist and continued to play until a few years before his death. He remained fond of music and was for a time the head of the New Haven Oratorio Society. Brown also played chess to a high standard and loved detective stories.

He enjoyed travelling and frequently crossed the Atlantic between the United States and Great Britain. With several professional colleagues, he was also an enthusiastic participant in the British Association&#x27;s extended visit to South Africa and other parts of southern and eastern Africa between July and October 1905.

His daily routine was unusual, and was described as follows:
&quot;He was in the habit of going to bed early and as a consequence woke up between three and five o&#x27;clock in the morning. After having fortified himself with strong coffee from a thermos bottle he set to work without leaving his bed, smoking numerous cigarettes. His serious scientific work was thus done before he got up for breakfast at nine o&#x27;clock.&quot;
===Death===
A heavy smoker, Brown suffered from bronchial trouble for much of his life. He was afflicted by ill-health during most of the six years of his retirement, and died in New Haven, Connecticut in 1938. His sister, Mildred, had died a few years before him and his only surviving close family was his widowed older sister, Ella Yorke, who had emigrated with her husband to New Zealand in the 1890s.

==Legacy==
Brown&#x27;s &quot;Tables&quot; were adopted by nearly all of the national ephemerides in 1923 for their calculations of the Moon&#x27;s position, and continued to be used with some modification until 1983. With the advent of digital computers, Brown&#x27;s original trigonometrical expressions, given in the introduction to his 1919 tables (and from which the tables had been compiled), began to be used for direct computation instead of the tables themselves. This also gained some improvement in precision, since the tables had embodied some minor approximations, in a trade-off between accuracy and the amount of labour needed for computations in those days of manual calculation.

By the middle of the 20th century, the difference between Universal and Ephemeris Time had been recognised and evaluated, and the troublesome empirical terms were removed. Further adjustments to Brown&#x27;s theory were then made, arising from improved observational values of the fundamental astronomical constants used in the theory, and from re-working Brown&#x27;s original analytical expansions to gain more precise versions of the coefficients used in the theory.

Eventually, in 1984, Brown&#x27;s work was replaced by results gained from more modern observational data (including data from lunar laser ranging) and altogether new computational methods for calculating the Moon&#x27;s ephemeris.

He was wounded in that battle and died a few days later at Deeg. Shamsher&#x27;s successor Ali Bahadur (Krishna Singh) established his authority over large parts of Bundelkhand and became the Peshwa&#x27;a Subedar of Banda.

Dutton, John Carroll Lynch, and Bernard Hill. The film follows a psychiatrist who finds herself incarcerated in the penitentiary in which she works, accused of brutally murdering her husband.

The fourth project developed by production company Dark Castle Entertainment, following 2002&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, &quot;Gothika&quot; was the second film by the company to be co-distributed by Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures, the first being &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;. It was also the first feature by Dark Castle to boast a number of high-profile stars in its lead roles.

&quot;Gothika&quot; was shot in Montreal, Quebec in the spring of 2003. It was released theatrically in the United States on November 21, 2003, the Friday before Thanksgiving. The film grossed $141.6 million internationally, though it received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Dr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist at Woodward Penitentiary in rural western Connecticut, crashes her car one night on a country road to avoid hitting a young woman. When she awakens, she finds herself an inmate of the women&#x27;s ward in which she works, receiving treatment from her colleague, Dr. Pete Graham. Pete reveals that her husband, Douglas, has been the victim of a brutal axe murder, and she is the sole suspect. As Miranda attempts to adjust to life as an inmate, she is haunted by visions of the young woman she saw the night of the car accident, and is attacked by her apparition; the woman carves the phrase &quot;Not Alone&quot; into Miranda&#x27;s arm, though hospital staff presume she is self-harming.

Miranda bonds with fellow inmate Chloe Sava, whom she treated before her incarceration. One night, she witnesses Chloe being raped and glimpses a tattoo of an Anima Sola on the perpetrator&#x27;s chest, though the guards do not believe her. As time passes, she regains memories of the car accident. She identifies the mysterious woman as Rachel, the daughter of her superior, Dr. Phil Parsons, who had died in an apparent suicide several years prior. Late one night, Miranda is attacked by Rachel&#x27;s ghost and escapes the hospital. She returns to her home and observes the crime scene. This triggers vivid memories of Miranda committing Douglas&#x27;s murder.

Miranda visits Douglas&#x27; rural farmhouse in Rhode Island, hoping it will contain clues. In a cellar in the barn, she finds a blood-stained mattress, along with sedatives, restraints, and video recording equipment. One of the tapes is revealed to be a snuff film shot by Douglas, which shows him raping, torturing, and murdering a young woman. Police arrive, arresting Miranda and finding one of Douglas&#x27;s victims, Tracey Seaver, still alive in the barn. Miranda realizes that Rachel possessed her to carry out the act and avenge Rachel&#x27;s own murder by Douglas.

Incarcerated in the county jail, Miranda speaks to Sheriff Bob Ryan, Douglas&#x27; best friend, about her belief that Rachel&#x27;s suicide was staged and a second perpetrator was involved. Using her expertise as a psychiatrist, she constructs a psychological profile of the second perpetrator and realizes it is Ryan, who then attempts to inject her with a sedative. In the struggle, she tears at his shirt, revealing the Anima Sola tattoo on his chest. She turns the syringe on Ryan before fleeing. In a drugged state, he pursues her, telling her that Rachel was their first victim, and he and Douglas worked together to abduct, rape, and murder local women. Rachel&#x27;s apparition appears and Ryan shoots at it, causing an explosion that sets him ablaze. Miranda shoots the burned Ryan to death. Moments later, Pete arrives to save her, having realized the truth.

A year later, Miranda, now freed, walks with Chloe, also released, on a city sidewalk. After Chloe leaves, Miranda sees a young boy on the road who is about to be struck by a fire truck. However, the fire truck passes right through him and she realizes he is only a ghost, failing to notice the &quot;Missing&quot; flyer of the boy.

==Cast==
==Production==
The fourth feature film produced by Dark Castle Entertainment, &quot;Gothika&quot; was the first to boast a high-profile leading cast, and was the company&#x27;s largest-scale production at the time, with a budget of approximately $40 million.

Berry was partly inspired to take the role because her mother, a nurse, worked in a psychiatric hospital for decades.

Filming took place in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in the spring of 2003. Shooting of Berry&#x27;s sequences was temporarily halted for several weeks in May 2003, after Robert Downey Jr., while filming a tense scene with Berry, grabbed and twisted her arm, accidentally breaking it.

==Soundtrack==
The score&#x27;s original music was composed by John Ottman. &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; by Limp Bizkit (originally by The Who) was featured in the film but was not available on the soundtrack. The record was released on November 18, 2003, via Varèse Sarabande.

==Release==
&quot;Gothika&quot; was released on November 21, 2003, in North America, grossing $19.3 million in the opening weekend and ranking at #2, behind &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. It went on to gross $59.7 million in the US and $81.9 million from foreign markets for a worldwide total of $141.6 million.

===Critical response===
The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;Gothika&quot; a 14% approval rating based on 167 reviews and an average rating of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Berry&#x27;s acting talents can&#x27;t save &quot;Gothika&quot; from its preposterous plot and bad dialogue.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

A more positive review came from Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote that &quot;the plot is preposterous&quot; but nonetheless felt that stylish direction and Berry&#x27;s performance made &quot;Gothika&quot; enjoyable on its own &quot;lurid&quot; terms: &quot;The casting of Halle Berry is useful to the movie because she evokes a vulnerable quality that triggers our concern. Hitchcock might have wanted to work with her. He didn&#x27;t cast so much for acting ability as for an innate quality.&quot;

===Home media=== 
&quot;Gothika&quot; was released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video on March 2, 2004. The initial DVD release was available in both widescreen and fullscreen editions. A two-disc special edition DVD, featuring additional documentaries and bonus features, was subsequently released in October 2004. The film was released on Blu-ray by Warner Bros. on September 25, 2007.

<doc id="793032" wikidata="Q106528337" url="?curid=793032" title="Acid (electronic music)">
<text>Acid is an umbrella term for styles of electronic music—such as acid house, acid trance, acid techno, and acid breaks—which employ the &quot;squelching&quot; sounds of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The acid sound became popular in the mid-1980s in connection with the Chicago house scene, including artists such as Phuture and labels like Trax Records.

The term &quot;acid&quot; specifically refers to the harsh squelching sound of the Roland 303. The acid sound is achieved by turning up the filter resonance and turning down the cutoff frequency parameters of the synthesizer, along with programming the 303&#x27;s accent, slide, and octave parameters. The term acid has also been suggested to refer to the psychedelic qualities of the music, which may resemble elements of 1960s acid rock.

<text>Frank Schlesinger (May 11, 1871 – July 10, 1943) was an American astronomer. His work concentrated on using photographic plates rather than direct visual studies for astronomical research.

==Biography==

Schlesinger was born in New York City and attended public schools there. He graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1890. He then worked as a surveyor, becoming a special student in astronomy at Columbia in 1894. In 1896, he received a fellowship which enabled him to study full-time, and he received a PhD in 1898. After his graduation, he spent the summer at Yerkes Observatory as a volunteer assisting director George Ellery Hale. 

He was an observer in charge of the International Latitude Observatory, Ukiah, California, in 1898. From 1899 to 1903, he was an astronomer at Yerkes, where he pioneered the use of photographic methods to determine stellar parallaxes. He was director of Allegheny Observatory from 1903 to 1920 and Yale University Observatory from 1920 to 1941.

At Yale he worked extensively with Ida Barney. He compiled and published the Yale Bright Star Catalogue. The first publication of the results of this work started in 1925 (&quot;Transactions of the Yale University Observatory&quot;, v. 4) and the work concluded in the 1980s. He made major contributions to astrometry. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society (1912), the National Academy of Sciences (1916) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and served as president of the American Astronomical Society (1919–1922), and the International Astronomical Union (1932–1935).

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; &quot;The name is so difficult for those who do not speak German that I am usually called &quot;sles&#x27;in-jer&quot;, to rhyme with &quot;messenger&quot;. It is, of course, of German origin and means &#x27;a native of Schlesien&#x27; or Silesia. In that language the pronunciation is &quot;shlayzinger&quot;, to rhyme with &quot;singer&quot;.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
*Valz Prize of the French Academy of Sciences (1926)
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1927)
*Bruce Medal (1929)
*The crater Schlesinger on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 1770 Schlesinger.

==Family==
He married Eva Hirsch in 1900 while in Ukiah. They had one child, Frank Wagner Schlesinger, who later directed planetariums in Philadelphia and Chicago. His wife died in 1928, and in 1929 he married Mrs. Katherine Bell (Rawling) Wilcox.

<doc id="793068" wikidata="Q1010639" url="?curid=793068" title="Mount Barker, South Australia">
<text>Mount Barker is a city in South Australia. Located approximately 33 kilometres (21 miles) from the Adelaide city centre, it is home to 21,554 residents (2021). It is the seat of the District Council of Mount Barker, the largest town in the Adelaide Hills, Part of Greater Adelaide, as well as one of the fastest-growing areas in the state.

Mount Barker lies at the base of a local eponymous peak called the Mount Barker summit. It is 50 kilometres from the Murray River. Mount Barker was traditionally a farming area. Many of the lots just outside the town area are farming lots, although some of them have been replaced with new subdivisions in recent times.

==History==
Mount Barker, the mountain, was sighted by Captain Charles Sturt in 1830, although he thought he was looking at the previously discovered Mount Lofty. This sighting of Mount Barker was the first by a European. Captain Collet Barker corrected Sturt&#x27;s error when he surveyed the area in 1831. Sturt named the mountain in honour of Captain Barker after he was killed later that year by local Aboriginal people at the Murray Mouth. The mountain was officially recognised by King William IV in 1834, two years before the colonisation of South Australia in 1836.

The first Europeans to ascend the mountain, on 27 November 1837, were a six-man party comprising John Barton Hack, John Morphett, Samuel Stephens, Charles Stuart (South Australian Company&#x27;s stock overseer), Thomas Davis (Hack&#x27;s stockman), and John Wade (a &quot;gentleman from Hobart Town&quot;). Four weeks later, on 25 December 1837, four colonists, Robert Cock, William Finlayson, A. Wyatt, and G. Barton, left Adelaide to examine the country south east of Adelaide toward Lake Alexandrina. Along the route, they also ascended the mount.

Mount Barker was originally home to the Peramangk Aboriginal people. The Ngarrindjeri people from the east also used the Summit for ceremonial and burial sites. The Mount Barker Summit is a significant Aboriginal area, and may be one of the most sacred sites near Adelaide. In 1984 the Ngarrindjeri people tried to prevent the building of a police communications tower, and in 1987 they also tried to stop the Telecom tower, although both attempts were not successful.

===Founding and growth===
Mount Barker township was surveyed in 1839 by Duncan McFarlane, who was hoping the area could be used for wheat and grain farming. The land was divided into lots of , although farmers didn&#x27;t settle until 1844, when John Dunn built the first steam flour mill outside of Adelaide. The flour mill ran for 50 years and is now a tourist attraction. All of the towns major buildings were built soon afterwards, with a post office (now replaced) in 1860 and a police station (also replaced) that was built in 1878. In 1883, the railway line from Adelaide to Strathalbyn was laid, but that line is now discontinued, with the line terminating short of Balhannah, and is used by the SteamRanger Heritage Railway.

Mount Barker has since developed into a large urban centre, which is developing very rapidly. The Mount Barker district council is the area that experienced the fourth largest growth between 1996 and 2006 in South Australia, with an increase of 3,800 new residents (3% growth per year). Mount Barker is ranked fifth for fastest growth in South Australia. During the last 10 years, many new subdivisions have been developed, such as Martin-Dale and Waterford. During this period, there has been an economic boom in Mount Barker and a number of additional malls and shopping centres, such as the Adelaide Hills Home-maker Centre, with a Radio Rentals, a Harvey Norman and the new offices for the District Council of Mount Barker. There have also recently been lodged plans for a new shopping centre, which will feature a major department store larger than 4,000 m 2.

===The discovery of clover===
Mount Barker is famous as the place where the value of subterranean clover, &quot;Trifolium subterraneum&quot; as a fodder crop was discovered, proved and first promoted by A. W. Howard. His property stood at the south-east corner of Princes Highway and Bald Hills Road. Subterranean clover had been known for a very long time in Central and Southern Europe, but was looked upon as a roadside weed. Howard proved that clover was a valuable fodder plant in some soil types in temperate climates. Subterranean clover revolutionised farming practices, converting many struggling farms into successful livestock holdings.

The discovery spread across Australia and to many other countries, due largely to Howard&#x27;s generosity in publishing articles about clover, supplying seed free of charge around the world, and advising on handling. By the time of his death (2 March 1930), thousands of hectares in South Australia were carrying subterranean clover. It was growing in all Australian States, and requests for seed and information were being received in great numbers from almost all countries in the world with a temperate climate.

Howard&#x27;s work is commemorated by a roadside plaque, by the incorporation of a clover leaf into the arms of the District Council of Mount Barker, and by the Howard&#x27;s End vineyard and winery on the same site.

===Rezoning controversy===

In 2003, largely due to concerns that Adelaide&#x27;s urban sprawl was encroaching onto surrounding farmlands, the then State Planning Minister Jay Weatherill made a commitment to contain the expansion of Mount Barker.

In 2008 a consortium of five developers sought the rezoning of of prime agricultural land in order to build an additional 7,700 new homes which would increase the population of Mount Barker from 10,258 to around 35,000. The land included rezoned to light industry in order to provide jobs for the new population. The plan was rejected by the Mount Barker Council as it had just completed a 15-year development plan for the area that would retain the town&#x27;s &quot;rural character&quot; and it could not afford the required infrastructure, a decision supported by a survey indicating that the rezoning was opposed by 98% of residents.

In April 2009, the developers approached Paul Holloway, the State Planning Minister, to override the council decision, arguing that the land had &quot;no outstanding attributes except for its suitability for urban development.&quot; In May 2009 the Minister announced that his office would go ahead and bypass the council. The following month Mark Parnell, the SA Greens representative in the South Australian Legislative Council made a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1991 for copies of documents passed between the developers and State Government.

In December 2010, the State Government approved the rezoning, and development and construction began without the usual council infrastructure. However, the state Government agreed to a $550 million infrastructure support package. The rezoning included amending the area&#x27;s bushfire risk level from high risk to only a general risk. The council expressed concern that the reduction of the threat level would lead to a reduction of building standards compared to those standards required for homes in high risk areas and pointed out that the previous year, Victoria&#x27;s Black Saturday bushfires Royal Commission had recommended that there should be less building in bushfire-prone areas.

The FOI documents, released in February 2012, indicated conflict of interest and poor planning practices. One document revealed that the Minister had ignored Planning SA&#x27;s request not to make any commitments to the developers before the state&#x27;s own 30-year plan was completed. South Australia&#x27;s Planning Minister John Rau (2010–present) said that the Government should not have approved the rezoning of land without the government and council being able to support that community with infrastructure. The Government has since announced it will reform the state&#x27;s planning process, calling it &quot;dishevelled, disjointed and inconsistent&quot;. A new interchange on the South Eastern Freeway at Bald Hills Road has been built to improve travel times and road safety for commuters travelling to the east side of Mount Barker and reduce traffic congestion in Mount Barker.

In March 2013, the State Ombudsman, Richard Bingham, handed down a report into a possible conflict of interest. The report found that the property consulting firm Connor Holmes &quot;had a clear conflict of interest&quot; that was known to Planning SA who took no action. Bingham suggested that the &quot;Independent Commission Against Corruption&quot; (ICAC) should investigate the Mount Barker development.

Connor Holmes was employed by the State Government to produce a &quot;Growth Investigations Report&quot; (GIA) as part of the state&#x27;s 30-year plan. The GIA was to identify areas suitable for housing developments. At the time Connor Holmes was bidding for the GIA contract it was also acting as a consultant for the five developers and was actively lobbying the State Planning Minister Paul Holloway to support the Mount Barker development on their clients behalf. The Government has declined to release the GIA report but the Ombudsman&#x27;s report noted that the urban boundaries proposed in the GIA were the same as those proposed by the five developers. On 6 March 2013, SA Greens MP Mark Parnell gave notice he would introduce a motion to the Legislative Council to refer the matter to ICAC.

The matter was investigated by the &quot;Independent Commission Against Corruption&quot; in 2013 with its findings published in June 2015. ICAC found no evidence of corruption.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The main route to Adelaide is via the South Eastern Freeway, which is used as a commuter road. The interchange at the western side of the town was built when the freeway was built in the 1970s. An additional interchange was opened in 2016 at the eastern side of the town.

===Rail===
Mount Barker was connected to the broad gauge network via the Adelaide-Wolseley railway line. Regular passenger services ended in 1984. In 1989, a not-for-profit railway preservation organisation, SteamRanger, was established by the Australian Railway Historical Society to operate its heritage train tours from Adelaide to Victor Harbor through the station. Six years later, as part of the One Nation infrastructure program, the main line between Adelaide and Melbourne was converted to standard gauge, leaving Steamranger&#x27;s depot at Dry Creek in metropolitan Adelaide isolated. As a result of rapid growth and traffic congestion on the South Eastern Freeway, sporadic calls have been made since the late 2010s to extend the former passenger rail service beyond Belair to Mount Barker. However, a 2022 government-sponsored report rejected the prospect of opening a train service, arguing that reliability and travel time would &quot;not come close&quot; to buses and cars.

<text>Ralph E. Griswold (May 19, 1934, Modesto, CA – October 4, 2006, Tucson, AZ) was a computer scientist known for his research into high-level programming languages and symbolic computation. His language credits include the string processing language SNOBOL, SL5, and Icon.

He attended Stanford University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics, then an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Griswold went to Bell Labs in 1962, where he studied ideas for non-numerical computation. SNOBOL was the outcome; it was a radically different language in its time and still is. He became the head of the Labs&#x27; Programming Research and Development department in 1967.

In 1971, he was hired by the University of Arizona to be its first professor of computer science, subsequently organized the department, and was its head until 1981. While at Arizona, Griswold developed Icon. The earlier Ratfor implementation of Icon was discarded and the language rewritten from scratch in C and UNIX.

In 1990 Griswold was appointed Regents&#x27; Professor, and he retired in 1995. &quot;As one of the founders of the Bell Labs software culture that spawned UNIX, C, and many other essential contributions to modern software, Ralph Griswold brought to his academic research not only brilliance, but also experience and a value system that demanded that research ideas be tested by fire and proven useful and usable by real users, not just good-looking diagrams in academic papers.&quot;

After his retirement, his interests turned to the mathematical aspects of weaving.

Griswold died on October 4, 2006, from cancer.

Griswold&#x27;s son, Bill Griswold, is also a computer scientist.

<text>A multifunction display (MFD) is a small-screen (CRT or LCD) surrounded by multiple soft keys (configurable buttons) that can be used to display information to the user in numerous configurable ways. MFDs originated in aviation, first in military aircraft, and later were adopted by commercial aircraft, general aviation, automotive use, motorsports use, and shipboard use.

== MFDs in aviation ==
Often, an MFD will be used in concert with a primary flight display (PFD), and forms a component of a glass cockpit. MFDs are part of the digital era of modern planes or helicopter. The first MFDs were introduced by air forces in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the F-111D (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970–73). The advantage of an MFD over analog display is that an MFD does not consume much space in the cockpit, as data can be presented in multiple pages, rather than always being present at once. For example, the cockpit of RAH-66 &quot;Comanche&quot; does not have analog dials or gauges at all. All information is displayed on the MFD pages. The possible MFD pages could differ for every plane, complementing their abilities (in combat).

Many MFDs allow pilots to display their navigation route, moving map, weather radar, NEXRAD, ground proximity warning system, traffic collision avoidance system, and airport information all on the same screen.

MFDs were added to the Space Shuttle (as the glass cockpit) starting in 1998, replacing the analog instruments and CRTs. The information being displayed is similar, and the glass cockpit was first flown on the STS-101 mission. Although many corporate business jets had them in years prior, the piston-powered Cirrus SR20 became the first part-23 certified aircraft to be delivered with an MFD in 1999 (and one of the first general aviation aircraft with a 10-in, flat-panel screen), followed closely by the Columbia 300 in 2000 and many others in the ensuing years.

In modern automotive technology, MFDs are used in cars to display navigation, entertainment, and vehicle status information.

<text>Angelo Secchi (; 28 June 1818 – 26 February 1878) was an Italian Catholic priest and astronomer from the Italian region of Emilia. He was director of the observatory at the Pontifical Gregorian University (then called the Roman College) for 28 years. He was a pioneer in astronomical spectroscopy, and was one of the first scientists to state authoritatively that the Sun is a star.

==Biography==
Secchi was born in Reggio Emilia, where he studied at the Jesuit gymnasium. At the age of 16, he entered the Jesuit Order in Rome. 
He continued his studies at the Roman College, and demonstrated great scientific ability. In 1839, he was appointed tutor of mathematics and physics at the college. In 1841, he became professor of physics at the Jesuit College in Loreto. In 1844, he began theological studies in Rome, and was ordained a priest on 12 September 1847. In 1848, due to the Roman Revolution, the Jesuits were ordered to leave Rome. Secchi spent the next two years in the United Kingdom at Stonyhurst College, where he met Alfred Weld, the Jesuit astronomer in charge of the Stonyhurst Observatory, who may have inspired him to take up the science. He moved on to the United States, where he taught for a time at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He also took his doctoral examination in theology there. 

During his stay in America, he met Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, the first director of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington. He studied with Maury and corresponded with him for many years.

He returned to Rome in 1850. On the recommendation of his late colleague Francesco de Vico, he became head of the observatory of the college at age 32. In 1853, under his direction, the crumbling observatory was relocated to a new facility on top of the Sant&#x27;Ignazio Church (the chapel of the college). Secchi served as director until his death.

Secchi was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1860.

His director position was challenged after 1870, when the remnant of the Papal States around Rome was taken over by the Kingdom of Italy. In 1873, the college was declared property of the Italian government. When the government moved to take over the observatory as well, Secchi protested vigorously, and threatened to leave the observatory for one of several positions offered to him by foreign observatories. He was offered important scientific positions and political dignities by the government, but refused to pledge allegiance to the Kingdom in place of the Pope. The royal government did not dare to interfere with him, and he continued as director.

He died in 1878 at age 59, in Rome.

==Astronomical works==

Secchi made contributions to many areas of astronomy. 
* He revised Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve&#x27;s catalog of double stars, compiling data for over 10,000 binaries.
* He discovered three comets, including Comet Secchi.
* He produced an exact map of the lunar crater Copernicus.
* He drew some of the first color illustrations of Mars and was the first to describe &quot;channels&quot; (&quot;canali&quot; in Italian) on the planetary surface.
* The first star recognized as a Be star was Gamma Cassiopeiae, which Secchi observed in 1866; the first star ever observed with emission lines.

Secchi was especially interested in the Sun, which he observed continually throughout his career.
* He observed and made drawings of solar eruptions and sunspots, and compiled records of sunspot activity.
* In 1860 and 1870, he organized expeditions to observe solar eclipses.
* He proved that the solar corona and coronal prominences observed during a solar eclipse were part of the Sun, and not artifacts of the eclipse.
* He discovered solar spicules.

However, his main area of interest was astronomical spectroscopy. He invented the heliospectrograph, star spectrograph, and telespectroscope. He showed that certain absorption lines in the spectrum of the Sun were caused by absorption in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Starting in 1863, he began collecting the spectra of stars, accumulating some 4,000 stellar spectrograms. Through analysis of this data, he discovered that the stars come in a limited number of distinct types and subtypes, which could be distinguished by their different spectral patterns. From this concept, he developed the first system of stellar classification: the five Secchi classes. While his system was superseded by the Harvard system, he still stands as discoverer of the principle of stellar classification, which is a fundamental element of astrophysics. His recognition of molecular bands of carbon radicals in the spectra of some stars made him the discoverer of carbon stars, which made one of his spectral classes.

==Other scientific and technical work==
Secchi was active in oceanography, meteorology, and physics, as well as astronomy.

He invented the Secchi disk, which is used to measure water transparency in oceans, lakes and fish farms. He studied the climate of Rome and invented a &quot;Meteorograph&quot; for the convenient recording of several categories of weather data. He also studied the aurora borealis, the effects of lightning, and the cause of hail. He organized the systematic monitoring of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and in 1858 established a magnetic observatory in Rome.

Secchi also performed related technical works for the Papal government, such as overseeing placement of sundials and repair or installation of municipal water systems. In 1854–1855, he supervised an exact survey of the Appian Way in Rome. This survey was later used in the topographic mapping of Italy. He supervised construction of lighthouses for the ports of the Papal States. In 1858, he traveled to France and Germany to procure the necessary projection lenses.

==Heritage==
The lunar crater Secchi and the Martian crater Secchi are both named after him, as is a main belt asteroid, 4705 Secchi.

The two STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) spacecraft each carry an instrument package called SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation).

<text>Josef Ludwig Franz Ressel (; June 29, 1793 – October 9, 1857) was a Bohemia-born Austrian forester and inventor who designed one of the first working ship&#x27;s propellers. 

Ressel was born in Chrudim, Bohemia then part of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Habsburg monarchy, which became part of the Austrian Empire in 1804. His father Anton Hermann Ressel was a native German speaker, and his mother Marie Anna Konvičková was a native Czech speaker. He studied at the Linz Gymnasium, Budweis (in today&#x27;s České Budějovice) artillery school, University of Vienna and the Mariabrunn Forestry Academy at Mariabrunn Monastery then near (now in) Vienna.

He worked for the Austrian government as a forester in the more southern parts of the monarchy, including in Motovun, Istria. His work was to secure a supply of quality wood for the Navy. He worked in Landstrass (Kostanjevica on the Krka river in Carniola), where he tested his ship propellers for the first time. In 1821 he was transferred to Trieste, the biggest port of the Austrian Empire, where his tests were successful. He was awarded a propeller patent in 1827. He modified a steam-powered boat &quot;Civetta&quot; by 1829 and test-navigated it in the Trieste harbor at six knots before the steam conduits exploded. Because of this misfortune, the police banned further testing. The explosion was not caused by the propeller being tested, as many believed at the time.

As early as 1804, the American John Fitch is credited with a screw propeller, which was unsuccessful. In 1836, the Englishman Francis Pettit Smith tested a screw propeller similar to Ressel&#x27;s. The first transatlantic journey of a ship powered by a screw-propeller was by the &quot;SS Great Britain&quot; in 1845. Propeller design stabilized in the 1880s.

Besides having been called &quot;the inventor of the propeller,&quot; he was also called the inventor of the steamship and a monument to him in a park in Vienna commemorates him as &quot;the one and only inventor of the screw propeller and steam shipping.&quot; He was also commemorated on Austria&#x27;s 500 Schilling banknote in the mid-1960s (P139), which shows him on the front and the ship &quot;Civetta&quot; on the back.

Among Ressel&#x27;s other inventions are pneumatic post and ball and cylinder bearings. He was granted numerous patents during his life.

Ressel also played an important role in the reforestation of the Karst Plateau near Trieste. A bronze statue of him was placed along the waterfront of Trieste on March 30, 2022.

He died in Laibach (now Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia) and was buried there in St. Christopher&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bežigrad district. His gravestone is displayed today in Navje Memorial Park.

<text>Aegopodium is a plant genus of the family Apiaceae native to Europe and western Asia. It is represented by about twelve species, all are herbs. Flowers are compounded, umbels appearing in spring-summer and are visited by many types of insect pollinators. Fruit consists of two-winged or ribbed nuts that separate on ripening.

The most well-known member is the &quot;Aegopodium podagraria&quot;, the ground elder also known as snow-on-the-mountain, Bishop&#x27;s weed, goutweed, native to Europe and Asia. It is variegated green and white that sometimes reverts to solid green within a patch. Small, white, five-petal flowers are held about three feet high, above the leaves, in flat topped clusters. Underground are long white branching rhizomes that vaguely resemble quackgrass. Regarded as an ecological threat, goutweed is aggressive, invasive and forms dense patches reducing species diversity in the ground layer. On the other hand, because of this, it is often used as a low maintenance ground cover.

== Cultivation ==
Plants from this genus are frost hardy but drought tender, preferring moist well-drained soil in an open sunny position. They can be propagated from seed or rhizome.

== Species ==
*&quot;Aegopodium alpestre&quot; 
*&quot;Aegopodium burttii&quot; 
*&quot;Aegopodium decumbens&quot; 
*&quot;Aegopodium handelii&quot; 
*&quot;Aegopodium henryi&quot;

<text>Bhargava () or Bhṛguvamsha refers to a Brahmin race or dynasty that is said to have been founded by the legendary Hindu sage Bhrigu.

== Legend ==

In Hinduism, the Bhargavas are the purohitas, the family priests, of the daityas and the danavas. They are regarded to be associated with the Angiras, the Atharvans, and the Ribhus, races named for their founders, who were also great sages. Some of the notable characters in Hinduism who belong to the Bhargava race include:

* Chyavana
* Shukra
* Shaunaka
* Richika
* Jamadagni
* Parashurama
* Valmiki
The rulers of the Haihaya dynasty are first described to be great patrons of Bhargavas such as Richika, to whom the latter served as the chief priest. When his son, Jamadagni, is murdered by the Haihaya king, Kartavirya Arjuna, his son, Parashurama, the incarnation of Vishnu, slays him. When his resurrected father is killed once more by the king&#x27;s son, he begins a quest to wipe out all the Kshatriya rulers he could find on earth, and bequeaths the colonised land to the Saptarishi.

== Lineage ==
In later legends, the Bhargavas were associated with the Haihayas, the Anarta of Gujarat, Kanyakubja of Madhyadesa, as well as the rulers of Malabar. It also refers to one of the Gotra&#x27;s of Shivalli Madhwa Brahmin (Shivalli Brahmin) community of coastal Karnataka state. 

Today, Bhargava also refers to a Brahmin community in India, who claim descent from the sage Bhrigu.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer originally from Kanazawa, Ishikawa.

He devoted his career to the study and measurement of variation in latitude, building upon the work of Seth Carlo Chandler, who discovered the Chandler wobble. In 1899, he became the first director of the International Latitude Observatory at Mizusawa, Japan.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1936. He was one of the first people to be awarded the Order of Culture when it was established in 1937.

The crater Kimura on the Moon is named after him, the same for the asteroid 6233 Kimura.

<text>Shillong (, ) is a hill station and the capital of Meghalaya, a state in northeastern India. It is the headquarters of the East Khasi Hills district. Shillong is the 330th most populous city in India with a population of 143,229 according to the 2011 census. It is said that the rolling hills around the town reminded the British of Scotland. Hence, they would refer to it as the &quot;Scotland of the East&quot;.

Shillong has steadily grown in size since it was made the civil station of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills in 1864 by the British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as the Chief Commissioner&#x27;s Province, Shillong was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration because of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and Surma valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India. Shillong remained the capital of undivided Assam until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to Dispur in Guwahati.

==Etymology==
Shillong is named after the god of the Khasis, &quot;U Blei Shyllong&quot;. The more widespread belief is that Shillong was named after a boy named “Aahlad” who was born to a virgin mother near Bisi.

==History==

Shillong was the capital of composite Assam during the British regime and later until a separate State of Meghalaya was formed. David Scott, the British civil servant of the East India Company, was the Agent of the Governor-General North East Frontier. During the First Anglo-Burmese War the British authorities felt the need for a road to connect Sylhet and Assam. The route was to traverse across the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. David Scott overcame the difficulties his administration faced from the opposition of the Khasi Syiems – their chiefs and people. Impressed by the favourable cool climate of Khasi Hills, they negotiated with the Syiem of Sohra in 1829 for a sanatorium for the British. Thus began the consolidation of British interests in the Khasi-Jaintia Hills.

In early 1829, a Khasis confederation mounted a serious uprising against British occupation. But by January 1833, their leader Tirot Sing surrendered to David Scott and was detained to Dacca (present-day Dhaka). A political agent was posted in Sohra, also known as Cherrapunjee. 

But the British did not like the climate and facilities of Sohra and they moved to Shillong. &quot;Ïewduh&quot; is the biggest market in Shillong. The name &quot;Shillong&quot; was later adopted, as the location of the new town was below the Shillong Peak.

In 1874, a separate Chief Commissionership was formed with Shillong as the seat of administration. The new administration included Sylhet, now a part of Bangladesh. Also included in the Chief Commissionership were the Naga Hills (present-day Nagaland), Lushai Hills (present-day Mizoram) as well as Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Hills. Shillong was the capital of composite Assam till 1969 when the autonomous state of Meghalaya was formed. In January 1972, Meghalaya was made a full-fledged state.

The Shillong Municipal Board dates back to 1878, when a proclamation was issued constituting Shillong and its suburbs, including the villages of Mawkhar and Laban, into a station under the Bengal Municipal Act of 1876. Inclusion of the villages of Mawkhar (S.E. Mawkhar, Jaiaw and part of Jhalupara and Mawprem) and Laban (Lumparing, Madan laban, Kench&#x27;s Trace and Rilbong) within the Municipality of Shillong was agreed to by Haiñ Manik Syiem of Mylliem under the agreement of 15 November 1878. But, there is no trace of Shillong in the British era maps dating back to 1878, up to 1900.

The great earthquake of 12 June 1897 of moment magnitude 8.1 killed 27 from Shillong and destroyed much of the town.

==Geography==

Shillong is at . It lies on the Shillong Plateau, the only major uplifted structure in the northern Indian shield. The city lies in the centre of the plateau and is surrounded by hills, three of which are revered in Khasi tradition: Lum Sohpetbneng, Lum Diengiei, and Lum Shyllong.

Shillong is just from Guwahati, which can be accessed by road along NH 40, a journey of about 2 hours 30 minutes through lush green hills and the Umiam lake in between.

===Smart Cities Mission===
Shillong has been selected as the 100th city to receive funding under the centre&#x27;s flagship &quot;Smart Cities Mission&quot; Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). In January 2016, 20 cities were announced under the Smart Cities Mission, followed by 13 cities in May 2016, 27 cities in September 2016, 30 cities in June 2017, and 9 cities in January this year. The total proposed investment in the finally selected 100 cities under the Smart Cities Mission would be 2,050,180 million. Under the scheme, each city will get 5000 million from the centre for implementing various projects.

===Climate===
Weather conditions in Shillong are typically pleasant, pollution-free. In the summer the temperature varies from . In the winter the temperature varies from .

Under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification the city features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). Its summers are cool and very rainy, while its winters are cool yet dry. Shillong is subject to vagaries of the monsoon. The monsoons arrive in June and it rains almost until the end of October.

Shillong is ranked among top 10 Indian cities with the cleanest air and best AQI in 2024. 

==Transport==

*National Highway 6 (India) – Connected to Guwahati, Tripura and Mizoram
*National Highway 106 (India) - Connected to Nongstoin
*National Highway 206 (India) - Connected to Dawki

Private bus operators, as well as state transport buses from other states, come to and from Shillong daily. Taxi services are also available to destination like Guwahati, Agartala, Kohima, Dimapur, Aizawl and other North Eastern towns and cities.

The Shillong Bypass &quot;(pictured)&quot; is a two lane road which stretches across connecting Umiam (NH-40) to Jorabat (NH-44) which then leads to other northeastern Indian states of Mizoram and Tripura. The project was estimated to have cost around and was completed in a span of two years (2011–2013).

===Airways===

Shillong is served by the Shillong Airport, which is located about 30 km away at Umroi. The airport has daily flights to and from Kolkata. It also have flights to and from Lilabari, Delhi, Silchar, Agartala, Imphal, Dimapur, Dibrugarh and Guwahati. Presently Indigo, Alliance Air and SpiceJet are operating regular services from the airport.

===Railways===
Teteliya-Byrnihat line, long, from Guwahati&#x27;s suburb Tetelia to Byrnihat near Shillong in Meghalaya is likely to be completed by March 2026. From Byrnihat it will be extended further to Shillong in future.

==Places of interest==
Tourist sites in and around the city include:
*Elephant Falls: 12 km on the outskirts of the city, the mountain stream descends through three successive falls set in dells of fern covered rocks.
*Ka Phan Nonglait Park: The park stretches over a kilometre and has an adjacent mini zoo.
*Ward&#x27;s Lake: Known locally as Nan-Polok. It is an artificial lake with garden and boating facilities, built during the colonial era.
*Shillong Golf Course: Shillong has one of the largest natural golf courses in Asia: Gleneagles of the East. It enjoys the rare distinction of being one of the few natural golf courses in Asia. Not only is the Shillong Golf Course scenic and enjoyable, it is also challenging. A group of British civil service officers introduced golf to Shillong in 1898 by constructing a nine-hole course. The present 18-hole course was inaugurated in 1924. The course is set in a valley covered with pine and rhododendron trees. The tight fairways, carpeted with a local grass which hardens the soil, are difficult to negotiate. The number of out-of-bounds streams that criss-cross every fairway makes it all the more trying. Obstructions come in the form of bunkers, trees and rain. The longest hole is the 6th, which is a gruelling 594 yards. Shillong Golf Course is considered to be the &quot;Glen Eagle of the East&quot; at the United States Golf Association Museum. It was set in a valley at an altitude of 5,200 ft in 1898 as a nine-hole course and later converted into an 18-hole course in 1924 by Captain Jackson and C. K. Rhodes.
*Motphran: The &quot;Monument of France&quot; which is locally known as &quot;Motphran&quot; was erected in memory of the 26th Khasi Labour Corps who served under the British in France during World War I. It bears the words of the Latin poet Horace &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; which can be roughly translated as &quot;It is sweet and honourable to die for one&#x27;s country. Due to government neglect and public apathy, this monument is now in a dilapidated condition standing.
*Shillong Peak: A picnic spot, 10 km from the city, 1966 m above sea level, offers a panoramic view of the scenic countryside and is the highest point in the state. Obeisance is paid to U Shyllong at the sanctum sanctorum at the peak&#x27;s summit every springtime, by the religious priest of Khyrim/Mylliem State.

<text>Stuart Dangerfield (born 17 September 1971, and from Willenhall in Staffordshire, now the West Midlands) is an English retired racing cyclist who was prominent in British individual time trial events during the 1990s and early 21st century. He was the British national time trial champion six times, jointly holding the record for most wins with Alex Dowsett.

Dangerfield won his first RTTC national time trial championship in 1992 in the hill-climb event - a victory he repeated in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1997, he was also a time trial champion; he also won the event four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. He won his first national championship in 2001, with repeat victories in 2003 and 2004. In 2001 he broke competition record with a time of 18&#x27;19&quot; (32.76 mph), knocking eight seconds off the previous record, set by Graeme Obree in 1993.

At world championship level, he has represented Great Britain in the individual time trial event at Holland 1998, Brittany 2000, Portugal 2001 and Belgium 2002. He also represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Canada 1994, Malaysia 1998 and Manchester 2002.

Dangerfield was little known outside club cycling circles in Britain, having grown up in the shadow of firstly Chris Boardman and then David Millar. However, Millar&#x27;s admission to using the illegal drug EPO and consequent expulsion from the Great Britain squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics meant that Dangerfield was called up into the Olympic squad to race the time trial. An injury to GB cyclist Jeremy Hunt also saw Dangerfield entered into the men&#x27;s road race. Dangerfield finished 30th in the time trial, but did not finish the road race.

At the Commonwealth Games in 2002 Dangerfield was disqualified for riding in the slipstream of a rider who had caught and passed him.

Dangerfield retired from time trialling competition in 2009.

<doc id="793194" wikidata="Q7716362" url="?curid=793194" title="The Beiderbecke Affair">
<text>The Beiderbecke Affair is a television series produced in the United Kingdom by ITV during 1985, written by the prolific Alan Plater, whose lengthy credits in British television since the 1960s included the four-part mini series &quot;Get Lost!&quot; for ITV in 1981. &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; has a similar style to &quot;Get Lost!&quot;, wherein Neville Keaton (Alun Armstrong) and Judy Threadgold (Bridget Turner) played in an ensemble cast. Although &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; was intended as a sequel to &quot;Get Lost!&quot;, Alun Armstrong proved to be unavailable and the premise was reworked. It is the first part of &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot;, with the two sequel series being &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Beiderbecke Connection&quot; (1988).

==Plot==
Rather than following a usual linear story structure, &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; – set in Leeds in 1985 – is a character-led drama with a plot that initially appears rather unclear, moving as it does from one seemingly unrelated event to another. These events – and the characters involved with them – are eventually shown to be interconnected.

Geordie Trevor Chaplin (James Bolam) teaches woodwork, enjoys football and is passionate about jazz. Jill Swinburne (Barbara Flynn) is interested in neither football nor jazz but teaches English and wants to help save the planet, standing in a local election as &quot;your Conservation candidate&quot;. After Jill left her husband, her colleague Trevor began giving her lifts to school and from there a relationship blossomed. They have an easy-going relationship where half the words seem to be left unspoken but the viewer is never in any doubt as to the subtext.
Trevor tries to buy some jazz records from a &quot;dazzlingly beautiful platinum blonde&quot; who calls at the door raising funds for the local Cubs’ football team. When the wrong records are delivered, a hunt begins that draws the pair into unforeseen intrigue. Thrown into the mix are Sgt Hobson (Dominic Jephcott), a suspicious yet seemingly incompetent graduate police detective, and a pair of local black economy tradesmen, &quot;Big Al&quot; (Terence Rigby) and &quot;Little Norm&quot; (Danny Schiller), who agree to help &quot;average-sized&quot; Jill and Trevor with their school supplies problems. There are elements of political and social commentary, whilst bureaucracy (within the police and local government) and the educational system are frequent targets of ridicule.

Setting the scene for the sequels, the series ends with Jill and Trevor &#x27;running away to the hills&#x27; (Beamsley Beacon, Beamsley). Unlike subsequent episodes the series ends with this scene and Big Al and Little Norm listening to the radio at their allotment; the viewer hears from this that a local senior police officer has been suspended, and a businessman and a councillor have been arrested. It is later revealed in the &quot;Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; that Mr McAllister and Councillor McAllister were imprisoned.

It all unravels to a soundtrack of jazz music in the style of Bix Beiderbecke, performed by Frank Ricotti with Kenny Baker as featured cornet soloist. Extensive use is made of leitmotifs for the various characters. The theme song of the series uses the actual Bix Beiderbecke instrumental &quot;Crying All Day&quot; by Frankie Trumbauer and His Orchestra released in 1927 on Okeh Records and re-released in 1941 as part of the &quot;Hot Jazz Classic&quot; series on Columbia Records.

==Characters==
The cast was as follows:
*Trevor Chaplin – James Bolam. Chaplin is a laid-back, slightly eccentric woodwork teacher at a comprehensive school. He is based on &quot;Mr Keaton&quot; from &quot;Get Lost!&quot;. Chaplin is in a relationship with Jill Swinburne.
*Jill Swinburne – Barbara Flynn is a committed environmentalist and social campaigner. An English teacher, she is educated and cultured. The name Swinburne was &quot;inherited&quot; from her ex-husband. The character was inspired by that of &quot;Mrs Threadgold&quot; from &quot;Get Lost!&quot;, but differs significantly in that Jill has a good sense of humour .
*Big Al – Terence Rigby. Big Al is a somewhat eccentric wheeler-dealer, recently unemployed from the building industry. He is the dominant half of the enterprise.
*Little Norm – Danny Schiller Little Norm is the submissive partner in the business with his &quot;brother&quot; Big Al. The plot makes it clear that Al, Norm and Janey are not in fact related, although they use sibling-based pronouns for each other on many occasions.
*Janey – Sue Jenkins Known by Trevor as &#x27;that dazzlingly beautiful platinum blonde&#x27;, Janey sells him records in aid of the Cubs football team, the consequences of which drive the plot of the &quot;affair&quot;.
*Sgt Hobson – Dominic Jephcott is a young, enthusiastic, graduate police officer. Well-spoken and knowledgeable about police procedure, he is however singularly incompetent – spending most of his duty hours investigating hypothetical crimes, and using his notes for his next thesis.
*Chief Superintendent Forrest – Colin Blakely Forrest is a plain-speaking and effective police superintendent. Jaded by the job, he has become thoroughly corrupt. Based on a character from &quot;Get Lost!&quot;, who was likewise disparaging towards his counterpart, however unlike Forrest he was neurotic and somewhat detached from reality.
*Mr Carter – Dudley Sutton Mr Carter is a jaded and cynical history teacher, and an ally of Jill and Trevor.
*Mr Wheeler – Keith Smith the school head teacher. A petty, neurotic jobsworth he is loathed by pupils and staff alike, but remains largely oblivious to the contempt in which he is held.
*Harry – Keith Marsh. A retired bookie&#x27;s runner and would-be supergrass. A seemingly harmless pensioner, often out walking with his dog, Jason. He is regularly referred to by the ambiguous description &quot;The man with the dog called Jason&quot;.
*Helen McAllister (Helen of Tadcaster) – Alison Skilbeck Helen is the somewhat needy ex-fiancée of Trevor Chaplin. Her father is a successful local businessman, involved in corruption with the local council and police, who uses Helen to get to know Trevor, whose friends he sees as acting in a manner which is counterproductive to the equilibrium he sees necessary to balance his business.
*Mr McAllister – James Grout Helen&#x27;s father, an affluent and less than legitimate businessman.
*Reverend Booth – Ian Bleasdale The Reverend Booth is the local vicar. Fed up with his occupation and casual in both the application of church policy, and towards life in general. He provides a cellar from where Big Al runs his &quot;business&quot;.
*Mr Pitt (Pitt the Planner) – Robert Longden. The head of the town planning department. A meek jobsworth, he nonetheless becomes concerned about the endemic local corruption. It is revealed later in the series that he is a jazz fan.

*The corner of Grange Avenue, on the way from Big Al&#x27;s allotment, is the corner of Grange Avenue and Windmill Lane, Yeadon.
*The telephone box that Trevor uses is at the junction of Parliament Road (now closed to traffic) and Hall Lane, near Armley Prison.
*The River Nidd and Knaresborough Viaduct can be seen in the background during Helen and Jill&#x27;s night out.

==Episodes==
The six episodes are titled by incipit, that is, the title is simply the first spoken words heard in each episode.


*&quot;What I don&#x27;t understand is this...&quot; – Trevor orders some jazz records which fail to turn up while Jill begins her campaign to stand for the council. Sgt Hobson becomes suspicious of the activities of Trevor, Jill, Big Al, Little Norm and later Big Al&#x27;s &#x27;sister&#x27; (the platinum blonde).
*&quot;Can anybody join in?&quot; – After attending a local football match in order to track down his missing records, Trevor agrees to referee. The match is abandoned after the police led by Sgt Hobson raid the pitch following crowd trouble. Trevor and Big Al meet to resolve the problem with the records.
*&quot;We call it the White Economy&quot; – Mysterious events aimed at intimidating Jill and Trevor begin to unfold, yet there is no indication who is doing this. Jill&#x27;s election meeting is sabotaged, meanwhile a former girlfriend of Trevor&#x27;s &#x27;Helen of Tadcaster&#x27; turns up unannounced at the election meeting. Meanwhile, Big Al&#x27;s warehouse is subjected to a police raid.
*&quot;Um...I know what you&#x27;re thinking&quot; – Trevor uncovers the cause of the events going on, after abducting Harry, but the motives for such still remain a mystery. Meanwhile, Jill and Helen have a meal and the two toss a coin over who gets Trevor, Helen winning.
*&quot;That was a very funny evening&quot; – The motives behind the recent events become clearer after the reasons behind Helen&#x27;s appearance start to be realised. Meanwhile, Jill contacts the town planning department and Trevor goes to dinner at Helen&#x27;s.
*&quot;We are on the brink of a new era, if only...&quot; – Trevor, Jill, Big Al, Little Norm, Mr Pitt and Sgt Hobson begin to gather evidence of corruption amongst local businesses, the town planning department and the local police. Jill loses the election, while Jill&#x27;s and Trevor&#x27;s houses are raided in an attempt to recover the evidence. Sgt Hobson presents the file to the chief constable and Chief Superintendent Forrest is sacked while Councillor McAllister and Mr McAllister are arrested by Sgt Hobson.

==In other media==
===Books===
There are four books associated with the series. Alan Plater&#x27;s first-ever book was a novelisation of &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; (Methuen, 1985) and then he originally wrote &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; as a novel (Methuen, 1986) before dramatising it for ITV. Four years after the final serial aired, he novelised &quot;The Beiderbecke Connection scripts&quot; (Methuen, 1992). An omnibus edition was released by Methuen in 1993.

In 2012, the British Film Institute published a book about the series in its range examining key television shows: &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; by William Gallagher. The book is non-fiction but it includes a Beiderbecke short story, &quot;A Brief Encounter with Richard Wagner&quot; by Alan Plater. It was written for BBC Radio 4 in the 1990s and this is its first publication in print.

Accompanying the non-fiction book, the British Film Institute released an author video plus a series of official &quot;Beiderbecke Affair&quot; podcasts that include a video interview with William Gallagher and with Plater&#x27;s wife, Shirley Rubinstein, plus audio commentaries by Gallagher for selected episodes of the Beiderbecke series.

===Show===
A show called &quot;Beiderbecke and All That Jazz&quot; was developed in the mid 1990s, featuring Alan Plater and Kenny Baker.

<text>Håkon Wium Lie (born July 26, 1965) is a Norwegian web pioneer, a standards activist, and the chairman of YesLogic, developers of Prince CSS-based PDF rendering software. He is best known for developing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) while working with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN in 1994. He was the chief technology officer of Opera Software from 1998 until the browser was sold to new owners in 2016.

== Education and career ==
Håkon Wium Lie attended Østfold University College, West Georgia College, and MIT Media Lab, receiving an MS in Visual Studies in 1991.

On February 17, 2006, he successfully defended his PhD thesis at the University of Oslo. His PhD thesis provides a background on the origins of CSS and a rationale to some of the design decisions behind it – particularly as to why some features were &quot;not&quot; included and why CSS avoids trying to become DSSSL.

He has worked for, among others, the W3C, INRIA, CERN, MIT Media Lab, and Norwegian telecom research in Televerket.

=== Web Standards ===

While working with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN in 1994, he proposed the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). As a showcase and testbed, he integrated CSS into the Arena web browser, which became the first CSS implementation.
After joining W3C in 1995, he worked on the CSS specifications, including CSS1, CSS2, and RFC 2318 (March 1998). Most of these specifications were developed with Bert Bos, who is considered co-creator of CSS. Over the next decade, CSS established itself as one of the fundamental web standards, with profound impact on typography, aesthetics, and accessibility on the web.

Along with his work on the CSS specifications, Wium Lie has been an activist for standards in general.

In 2005, he wrote an open letter to Bill Gates of Microsoft, asking why Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer did not support common web standards. A few days later, when Bill Gates announced that Internet Explorer 7 would be launched, Wium Lie responded by launching the Acid2 challenge to Microsoft. Although primarily targeted at Microsoft, the Acid2 test was also difficult for other browsers. Since then, Acid2 and the subsequent Acid3 have established themselves as benchmark tests which all browsers are measured against.

In 2006, Wium Lie started campaigning for browsers to support downloadable web fonts using common font formats. , all major browser vendors have implemented web fonts this way.

In 2007, Wium Lie started campaigning for the video element to make it easier to publish video on the web. At Google I/O in 2011, Wium Lie presented the video element in combination with the WebM format which Google had open-sourced.

In 2008, he was spokesperson for a group of technical committee members who resigned over the decision by Standards Norway to vote for the approval of OOXML.

Wium Lie has also promoted the concept of printing from the web. The third edition of his book on CSS, co-authored with Bert Bos, was produced from HTML and CSS files. These files were then converted to PDF by the Prince XML + CSS formatter. In 2005, he joined the board of YesLogic, the company that makes the Prince formatter.

Building on his experience with web printing, in 2011 Wium Lie proposed to extend CSS to support pagination on screens.

He has argued against the use of formatting objects and CSS Regions on the web.

=== CTO of Opera Software ===

In April 1999, Wium Lie joined Opera Software in Oslo, Norway as CTO. His move was motivated by seeing Opera programmers make more progress on implementing CSS in three months than what Netscape and Microsoft had achieved in three years.

At Opera, he spearheaded the development of mobile browsers, in particular small-screen rendering of web pages. Small-screen rendering enabled Opera to show normal web pages on the small screens commonly found on feature phones running the Opera Mini browser.

When Opera Software filed a complaint against Microsoft in the EU over Internet Explorer in 2007, Wium Lie was a spokesperson, stressing the need for Microsoft to fully support web standards in their browser. Opera&#x27;s complaint led to a settlement where Microsoft started offering rival browsers from a browser choice screen to Windows users in Europe, and Wium Lie declared this a victory for the web.

In 2013, Opera started a gradual transition from its own Presto web engine, to the WebKit engine also used by Safari and Google Chrome. Wium Lie said that it made most sense to work with the open-source communities than to continue developing its own engine.

=== Chairman of YesLogic ===

Wium Lie has been chairman of YesLogic, the developers of Prince, since 2004. Prince uses CSS to render HTML as highly styled PDF with complex layout.

== Political and civic activities ==
In 2005, when politicians declared defeat against advertising towers on public pavements in Oslo, Wium Lie started the Stans.no campaign. In 2009, Stans!no filed a suit against the city for allowing advertising towers to be built in public places, and the city subsequently bought the advertising towers and dismantled them. After the advertising towers were removed, Stans.no has continued working against other types of advertising in the public space.

To encourage sponsors to support the OLPC project, in 2008 Wium Lie ordered 100 laptops and turned his Oslo home into a temporary OLPC village.

In 2012 he co-founded the Pirate Party of Norway, and he ran as their candidate in the 2013 election and the 2019 election.

In 2014, he proposed to use the two unused Norwegian TLDs (.sj and .bv) to create privacy-enhanced zones.

Wium Lie is a self-declared social democrat and he has contributed economically to cultural and political causes. In 2007 he gave a significant contribution to the new Oslo Opera House.

In 2017, he was an initial investor in the Norwegian online alternative newspaper Resett, stating that it was meaningful to help provide a platform for Helge Lurås, a critic of NATO campaigns in Afghanistan and Libya, and Bjørn Ihler, a survivor of the Utøya massacre.

Wium Lie is against Norwegian membership in the EEA and when the party Alliansen was formed as an anti-EEA party in 2017 he was on the election list for parliament for Akershus. However, Wium Lie denounced the party before the election due to its shifting platform.

In 2018, Wium Lie was sued by Lovdata for publishing Norwegian court decisions on rettspraksis.no, a volunteer web site. In less than 24 hours, the web site was closed by the Oslo court, and Wium Lie was sentenced to pay the legal bills of Lovdata. Under Norwegian law, court decisions are exempted from copyright but Wium Lie was not allowed to appear in court. In the wake of this decision, members of the Norwegian Parliament have asked for changes in how Lovdata is organized. The case has been appealed and will be decided by the Supreme Court of Norway.

== Personal life ==

Wium Lie lives in Oslo, Norway. There, he has started web-based campaigns against high-rise buildings and advertising in the public space. Wium Lie also maintains a woodworking studio and runs an organic farm.

== Awards and recognition ==

In 1999, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

In 2001, he was a Technology Pioneer at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

In 2017, Wium Lie held a keynote at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2017, talking about his contributions to the web today with the creation of CSS, and how it has evolved together with the web itself up to its current state.

<text>Itanagar () is the capital and largest town of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. The seat of Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the seat of government of Arunachal Pradesh, and the seat of Gauhati High Court permanent bench at Naharlagun are all in Itanagar. Being the hub of all the major economic bases, Itanagar, along with the adjacent town of Naharlagun, comprise the administrative region of the Itanagar Capital Complex Region. This stretches from the Itanagar Municipal limit at Chandranagar Town extended until Nirjuli Town, and is a major junction of cultural, economic, fashion, education and recreational activities.

* Ita Fort, one of the most important historical sites in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. The name literally means &quot;Fort of bricks&quot;( brick being called &quot;Ita&quot; in the Assamese language). The Ita Fort was built as early as the 14th or the 15th century. The fort has an irregular shape, built mainly with bricks dating back to the 14th-15th Century. The total brickwork is of 16,200 cubic meter lengths which have been identified by some scholars with the Chutiya kingdom. The fort has three different entrances at three different sides, which are western, eastern, and southern sides.
* Jawaharlal Nehru Museum, Itanagar is also known for showcasing the rich tribal culture of the state.
* Gekar sinyi (Ganga Lake) is a beautiful natural lake which literally means &quot;confined lake&quot; in the Nyishi dialect. It is surrounded by a landmass of hard rock.

<doc id="793295" wikidata="Q3845212" url="?curid=793295" title="Mapping class group">
<text>In mathematics, in the subfield of geometric topology, the mapping class group is an important algebraic invariant of a topological space. Briefly, the mapping class group is a certain discrete group corresponding to symmetries of the space.

== Motivation ==
Consider a topological space, that is, a space with some notion of closeness between points in the space. We can consider the set of homeomorphisms from the space into itself, that is, continuous maps with continuous inverses: functions which stretch and deform the space continuously without breaking or gluing the space. This set of homeomorphisms can be thought of as a space itself. It forms a group under functional composition. We can also define a topology on this new space of homeomorphisms. The open sets of this new function space will be made up of sets of functions that map compact subsets &quot;K&quot; into open subsets &quot;U&quot; as &quot;K&quot; and &quot;U&quot; range throughout our original topological space, completed with their finite intersections (which must be open by definition of topology) and arbitrary unions (again which must be open). This gives a notion of continuity on the space of functions, so that we can consider continuous deformation of the homeomorphisms themselves: called homotopies. We define the mapping class group by taking homotopy classes of homeomorphisms, and inducing the group structure from the functional composition group structure already present on the space of homeomorphisms.

== Definition ==
The term mapping class group has a flexible usage. Most often it is used in the context of a manifold &quot;M&quot;. The mapping class group of &quot;M&quot; is interpreted as the group of isotopy classes of automorphisms of &quot;M&quot;. So if &quot;M&quot; is a topological manifold, the mapping class group is the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is a smooth manifold, the mapping class group is the group of isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of &quot;M&quot;. Whenever the group of automorphisms of an object &quot;X&quot; has a natural topology, the mapping class group of &quot;X&quot; is defined as formula_1, where formula_2 is the path-component of the identity in formula_3. (Notice that in the compact-open topology, path components and isotopy classes coincide, i.e., two maps &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are in the same path-component iff they are isotopic). For topological spaces, this is usually the compact-open topology. In the low-dimensional topology literature, the mapping class group of &quot;X&quot; is usually denoted MCG(&quot;X&quot;), although it is also frequently denoted formula_4, where one substitutes for Aut the appropriate group for the category to which &quot;X&quot; belongs. Here formula_5 denotes the 0-th homotopy group of a space.

So in general, there is a short exact sequence of groups:

:formula_6

Frequently this sequence is not split.

If working in the homotopy category, the mapping class group of &quot;X&quot; is the group of homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of &quot;X&quot;.

There are many subgroups of mapping class groups that are frequently studied. If &quot;M&quot; is an oriented manifold, formula_7 would be the orientation-preserving automorphisms of &quot;M&quot; and so the mapping class group of &quot;M&quot; (as an oriented manifold) would be index two in the mapping class group of &quot;M&quot; (as an unoriented manifold) provided &quot;M&quot; admits an orientation-reversing automorphism. Similarly, the subgroup that acts as the identity on all the homology groups of &quot;M&quot; is called the Torelli group of &quot;M&quot;.

==Examples==

=== Sphere ===
In any category (smooth, PL, topological, homotopy)
:formula_8
corresponding to maps of degree ±1.

=== Torus ===
In the homotopy category
:formula_9
This is because the n-dimensional torus formula_10 is an Eilenberg–MacLane space.

For other categories if formula_11, one has the following split-exact sequences:

In the category of topological spaces
:formula_12
In the PL-category
:formula_13
(⊕ representing direct sum).
In the smooth category
:formula_14

where formula_15 are the Kervaire–Milnor finite abelian groups of homotopy spheres and formula_16 is the group of order 2.

=== Surfaces ===
The mapping class groups of surfaces have been heavily studied, and are sometimes called Teichmüller modular groups (note the special case of formula_17 above), since they act on Teichmüller space and the quotient is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces homeomorphic to the surface. These groups exhibit features similar both to hyperbolic groups and to higher rank linear groups. They have many applications in Thurston&#x27;s theory of geometric three-manifolds (for example, to surface bundles). The elements of this group have also been studied by themselves: an important result is the Nielsen–Thurston classification theorem, and a generating family for the group is given by Dehn twists which are in a sense the &quot;simplest&quot; mapping classes. Every finite group is a subgroup of the mapping class group of a closed, orientable surface; in fact one can realize any finite group as the group of isometries of some compact Riemann surface (which immediately implies that it injects in the mapping class group of the underlying topological surface).

==== Non-orientable surfaces ====
Some non-orientable surfaces have mapping class groups with simple presentations. For example, every homeomorphism of the real projective plane formula_18 is isotopic to the identity:

:formula_19

The mapping class group of the Klein bottle &quot;K&quot; is:

:formula_20

The four elements are the identity, a Dehn twist on a two-sided curve which does not bound a Möbius strip, the y-homeomorphism of Lickorish, and the product of the twist and the y-homeomorphism. It is a nice exercise to show that the square of the Dehn twist is isotopic to the identity.

We also remark that the closed genus three non-orientable surface &quot;N&quot;3 (the connected sum of three projective planes) has:

:formula_21

This is because the surface &quot;N&quot; has a unique class of one-sided curves such that, when &quot;N&quot; is cut open along such a curve &quot;C&quot;, the resulting surface formula_22 is &quot;a torus with a disk removed&quot;. As an unoriented surface, its mapping class group is formula_23. (Lemma 2.1).

=== 3-Manifolds ===
Mapping class groups of 3-manifolds have received considerable study as well, and are closely related to mapping class groups of 2-manifolds. For example, any finite group can be realized as the mapping class group (and also the isometry group) of a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold.

== Mapping class groups of pairs ==
Given a pair of spaces &quot;(X,A)&quot; the mapping class group of the pair is the isotopy-classes of automorphisms of the pair, where an automorphism of &quot;(X,A)&quot; is defined as an automorphism of &quot;X&quot; that preserves &quot;A&quot;, i.e. &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is invertible and &quot;f(A)&quot; = &quot;A&quot;.

=== Symmetry group of knot and links ===
If &quot;K&quot; ⊂ S3 is a knot or a link, the symmetry group of the knot (resp. link) is defined to be the mapping class group of the pair (S3, &quot;K&quot;). The symmetry group of a hyperbolic knot is known to be dihedral or cyclic; moreover every dihedral and cyclic group can be realized as symmetry groups of knots. The symmetry group of a torus knot is known to be of order two Z2.

== Torelli group ==
Notice that there is an induced action of the mapping class group on the homology (and cohomology) of the space &quot;X&quot;. This is because (co)homology is functorial and Homeo0 acts trivially (because all elements are isotopic, hence homotopic to the identity, which acts trivially, and action on (co)homology is invariant under homotopy). The kernel of this action is the &quot;Torelli group&quot;, named after the Torelli theorem.

In the case of orientable surfaces, this is the action on first cohomology &quot;H&quot;1(Σ) ≅ Z2&quot;g&quot;. Orientation-preserving maps are precisely those that act trivially on top cohomology &quot;H&quot;2(Σ) ≅ Z. &quot;H&quot;1(Σ) has a symplectic structure, coming from the cup product; since these maps are automorphisms, and maps preserve the cup product, the mapping class group acts as symplectic automorphisms, and indeed all symplectic automorphisms are realized, yielding the short exact sequence:
:formula_24

One can extend this to
:formula_25

The symplectic group is well understood. Hence understanding the algebraic structure of the mapping class group often reduces to questions about the Torelli group.

Note that for the torus (genus 1) the map to the symplectic group is an isomorphism, and the Torelli group vanishes.

== Stable mapping class group ==

One can embed the surface formula_26 of genus &quot;g&quot; and 1 boundary component into formula_27 by attaching an additional hole on the end (i.e., gluing together formula_26 and formula_29), and thus automorphisms of the small surface fixing the boundary extend to the larger surface. Taking the direct limit of these groups and inclusions yields the stable mapping class group, whose rational cohomology ring was conjectured by David Mumford (one of conjectures called the Mumford conjectures). The integral (not just rational) cohomology ring was computed in 2002 by Ib Madsen and Michael Weiss, proving Mumford&#x27;s conjecture.

<text>Maria McCann is an English novelist.

==Biography==
McCann was born in Liverpool in 1956 and worked as a lecturer in English at Strode College, Street, Somerset since 1985, until starting work with Arden.

Her first novel, &quot;As Meat Loves Salt&quot;, was released in 2001. The story focuses on the relationship of two men, Jacob Cullen and Christopher Ferris, and is set during the English Civil War. They desert their posts in Cromwell’s New Model Army to establish a farming commune in the countryside. The novel was well received by critics including Orange Prize winner Lionel Shriver.

McCann also contributed a short story titled &quot;Minimal&quot; to the anthology &quot;New Writing 12&quot; published by the British Council in 2005.

Her second novel, &quot;The Wilding&quot;, was published in February 2010. Set in England in the 1670s, it is the story of a young cider-presser, Jonathan Dymond, his dark family secrets, and the young beggar woman he tries to help. It was long-listed for the Orange Prize.

&quot;Ace, King, Knave&quot;, her third novel, was published in 2013. It is set in London of the 1760s. It tells an interwoven tale of a recently married gentlewoman of some means, Sophia, her controlling but often absent and mysterious husband Mr Zedland, Titus the black slave he gives her as a wedding present, and Betsy-Ann an ex-prostitute. The dialogue makes extensive use of Thieves&#x27; Cant and a glossary is provided.

<doc id="793325" wikidata="Q139710" url="?curid=793325" title="Zachman Framework">
<text>The Zachman Framework is an enterprise ontology and is a fundamental structure for enterprise architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, and Why. The second is derived from the philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: identification, definition, representation, specification, configuration and instantiation.

The Zachman Framework is not a methodology in that it does not imply any specific method or process for collecting, managing, or using the information that it describes; rather, it is an ontology whereby a schema for organizing architectural artifacts (in other words, design documents, specifications, and models) is used to take into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed.

The framework is named after its creator John Zachman, who first developed the concept in the 1980s at IBM. It has been updated several times since.

== Overview ==
The title &quot;Zachman Framework&quot; refers to The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture with version 3.0 being the most current. The Zachman Framework has evolved in its thirty-year history to include:
* The initial framework, named &quot;A Framework for Information Systems Architecture&quot;, by John Zachman published in a 1987 article in the IBM Systems journal.
* The &quot;Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture&quot;, an update of the 1987 original in the 1990s extended and renamed .
* One of the later versions of the Zachman Framework, offered by Zachman International as industry standard.
In other sources the Zachman Framework is introduced as a framework, originated by and named after John Zachman, represented in numerous ways, see image. This framework is explained as, for example: 
* a framework to organize and analyze data,
* a framework for enterprise architecture.
* a classification system, or classification scheme
* a matrix, often in a 6x6 matrix format
* a two-dimensional model or an analytic model.
* a two-dimensional schema, used to organize the detailed representations of the enterprise.
Beside the frameworks developed by John Zachman, numerous extensions and/or applications have been developed, which are also sometimes called Zachman Frameworks, however they generally tend to be graphical overlays of the actual framework itself.
The Zachman Framework summarizes a collection of perspectives involved in enterprise architecture. These perspectives are represented in a two-dimensional matrix that defines along the rows the type of stakeholders and with the columns the aspects of the architecture. The framework does not define a methodology for an architecture. Rather, the matrix is a template that must be filled in by the goals/rules, processes, material, roles, locations, and events specifically required by the organization. Further modeling by mapping between columns in the framework identifies gaps in the documented state of the organization.

The framework is a logical structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It is significant to both the management of the enterprise, and the actors involved in the development of enterprise systems. While there is no order of priority for the columns of the Framework, the top-down order of the rows is significant to the alignment of business concepts and the actual physical enterprise. The level of detail in the Framework is a function of each cell (and not the rows). When done by IT the lower level of focus is on information technology, however it can apply equally to physical material (ball valves, piping, transformers, fuse boxes for example) and the associated physical processes, roles, locations etc. related to those items.

== History ==
In the 1980s John Zachman had been involved at IBM in the development of business system planning (BSP), a method for analyzing, defining and designing an information architecture of organizations. In 1982 Zachman had already concluded that these analyses could reach far beyond automating systems design and managing data into the realms of strategic business planning and management science in general. It may be employed in the (in that time considered more esoteric) areas of enterprise architecture, data-driven systems design, data classification criteria, and more.

=== &quot;Information Systems Architecture&quot; framework ===

In the 1987 article &quot;A Framework for Information Systems Architecture&quot; Zachman noted that the term &quot;architecture&quot; was used loosely by information systems professionals, and meant different things to planners, designers, programmers, communication specialists, and others. In searching for an objective, independent basis upon which to develop a framework for information systems architecture, Zachman looked at the field of classical architecture, and a variety of complex engineering projects in industry. He saw a similar approach and concluded that architectures exist on many levels and involves at least three perspectives: raw material or data, function of processes, and location or networks.

The Information Systems Architecture is designed to be a classification schema for organizing architecture models. It provides a synoptic view of the models needed for enterprise architecture. Information Systems Architecture does not define in detail what the models should contain, it does not enforce the modeling language used for each model, and it does not propose a method for creating these models.

=== Extension and formalization ===
In the 1992 article &quot;Extending and Formalizing the Framework for Information Systems Architecture&quot; John F. Sowa and John Zachman present the framework and its recent extensions and show how it can be formalized in the notation of conceptual graphs. Also in 1992:

Later during the 1990s
* Methodologists like Clive Finkelstein refocused on the top two framework rows which he labeled Enterprise Engineering and has one of the most successful methods for converging the business needs with information technology engineering implementation, and determining a logical build sequence of the pieces.

=== Framework for enterprise architecture ===
In the 1997 paper &quot;Concepts of the Framework for Enterprise Architecture&quot; Zachman said that the framework should be referred to as a &quot;Framework for Enterprise Architecture&quot;, and should have from the beginning. In the early 1980s however, according to Zachman, there was &quot;little interest in the idea of Enterprise Reengineering or Enterprise Modeling and the use of formalisms and models was generally limited to some aspects of application development within the Information Systems community&quot;.

In 2008 Zachman Enterprise introduced the &quot;Zachman Framework: The Official Concise Definition&quot; as a new Zachman Framework standard.

=== Extended and modified frameworks ===
Since the 1990s several extended frameworks have been proposed, such as:
* Matthew &amp; McGee (1990) extended the three initial perspectives &quot;what&quot;, &quot;how&quot; and &quot;where&quot;, to event (the &quot;when&quot;), reason (the &quot;why&quot;) and organization (the &quot;who&quot;).
* Schoch &amp; Laplante (1995) published in the &quot;IBM Systems Journal&quot; (vol. 34, no.1, January 1995, pp.22-38) &quot;A Framework for Real-Time Systems Architecture,&quot; an extension of the original Zachman Framework that applies to real-time systems.
* Evernden (1996) presented an alternative Information FrameWork.
* The Integrated Architecture Framework developed by Capgemini since 1996.
* Vladan Jovanovic et al. (2006) presents a Zachman Cube, an extended of the Zachman Framework into a multidimensional Zachman&#x27;s Cube.

== Zachman Framework topics ==

=== Concept ===
The basic idea behind the Zachman Framework is that the same complex thing or item can be described for different purposes in different ways using different types of descriptions (e.g., textual, graphical). The Zachman Framework provides the thirty-six necessary categories for completely describing anything; especially complex things like manufactured goods (e.g., appliances), constructed structures (e.g., buildings), and enterprises (i.e., the organization and all of its goals, people, and technologies). The framework provides six different transformations of an abstract idea (not increasing in detail, but transforming) from six different perspectives.

It allows different people to look at the same thing from different perspectives. This creates a holistic view of the environment, an important capability illustrated in the figure.

=== Views of rows ===
Each row represents a total view of the solution from a particular perspective. An upper row or perspective does not necessarily have a more comprehensive understanding of the whole than a lower perspective. Each row represents a distinct, unique perspective; however, the deliverables from each perspective must provide sufficient detail to define the solution at the level of perspective and must translate to the next lower row explicitly.

Each perspective must take into account the requirements of the other perspectives and the restraint those perspectives impose. The constraints of each perspective are additive. For example, the constraints of higher rows affect the rows below. The constraints of lower rows can, but do not necessarily affect the higher rows. Understanding the requirements and constraints necessitates communication of knowledge and understanding from perspective to perspective. The Framework points the vertical direction for that communication between perspectives.

The current version (3) of the Zachman Framework categorizes the rows as follows:
* &quot;Executive Perspective&quot; (Scope Contents) – The first architectural sketch is a &quot;bubble chart&quot; or Venn diagram, which depicts in gross terms the size, shape, partial relationships, and basic purpose of the final structure. It corresponds to an executive summary for a planner or investor who wants an overview or estimate of the scope of the system, what it would cost, and how it would relate to the general environment in which it will operate.
* &quot;Business Management Perspective&quot; (Business Concepts) – Next are the architect&#x27;s drawings that depict the final building from the perspective of the owner, who will have to live with it in the daily routines of business. They correspond to the enterprise (business) models, which constitute the designs of the business and show the business entities and processes and how they relate.
* &quot;Architect Perspective&quot; (System Logic) – The architect&#x27;s plans are the translation of the drawings into detail requirements representations from the designer&#x27;s perspective. They correspond to the system model designed by a systems analyst who must determine the data elements, logical process flows, and functions that represent business entities and processes.
* &quot;Engineer Perspective&quot; (Technology Physics) – The contractor must redraw the architect&#x27;s plans to represent the builder&#x27;s perspective, with sufficient detail to understand the constraints of tools, technology, and materials. The builder&#x27;s plans correspond to the technology models, which must adapt the information systems model to the details of the programming languages, input/output (I/O) devices, or other required supporting technology.
* &quot;Technician Perspective&quot; (Tool Components) – Subcontractors work from shop plans that specify the details of parts or subsections. These correspond to the detailed specifications that are given to programmers who code individual modules without being concerned with the overall context or structure of the system. Alternatively, they could represent the detailed requirements for various commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or components of modular systems software being procured and implemented rather than built.
* &quot;Enterprise Perspective&quot; or (Operations Instances)

=== Focus of columns ===
In summary, each perspective focuses attention on the same fundamental questions, then answers those questions from that viewpoint, creating different descriptive representations (i.e., models), which translate from higher to lower perspectives. The basic model for the focus (or product abstraction) remains constant. The basic model of each column is uniquely defined, yet related across and down the matrix. In addition, the six categories of enterprise architecture components, and the underlying interrogatives that they answer, form the columns of the Zachman Framework and these are:
# Inventory Sets – What
# Process Flows – How
# Distribution Networks – Where
# Responsibility Assignments – Who
# Timing Cycles – When
# Motivation Intentions – Why
In Zachman&#x27;s opinion, the single factor that makes his framework unique is that each element on either axis of the matrix is explicitly distinguishable from all the other elements on that axis. The representations in each cell of the matrix are not merely successive levels of increasing detail, but actually are different representations—different in context, meaning, motivation, and use. Because each of the elements on either axis is explicitly different from the others, it is possible to define precisely what belongs in each cell.

=== Models of cells ===
The Zachman Framework typically is depicted as a bounded 6 x 6 &quot;matrix&quot; with the Communication Interrogatives as Columns and the Reification Transformations as Rows. The framework classifications are repressed by the Cells, that is, the intersection between the Interrogatives and the Transformations.

The cell descriptions are taken directly from version 3.0 of the Zachman Framework.

# (What) Inventory Identification 
# (How) Process Identification 
# (Where) Distribution Identification 
# (Who) Responsibility Identification 
# (When) Timing Identification 
# (Why) Motivation Identification

# (How) Process Configuration

# (How) Process Instantiations 
# (Where) Distribution Instantiations

# (Why) Motivation Instantiations

Since the product development (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell is the answer to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.

=== Framework set of rules ===
The framework comes with a set of rules:
* &quot;Rule 1 The columns have no order&quot; : The columns are interchangeable but cannot be reduced or created
* &quot;Rule 2 Each column has a simple generic model&quot; : Every column can have its own meta-model
* &quot;Rule 3 The basic model of each column must be unique&quot; : The basic model of each column, the relationship objects and the structure of it is unique. Each relationship object is interdependent but the representation objective is unique.
* &quot;Rule 4 Each row describes a distinct, unique perspective&quot; : Each row describes the view of a particular business group and is unique to it. All rows are usually present in most hierarchical organizations.
* &quot;Rule 5 Each cell is unique&quot; : The combination of 2,3 &amp; 4 must produce unique cells where each cell represents a particular case. Example: A2 represents business outputs as they represent what are to be eventually constructed.
* &quot;Rule 6 The composite or integration of all cell models in one row constitutes a complete model from the perspective of that row&quot; : For the same reason as for not adding rows and columns, changing the names may change the fundamental logical structure of the Framework.
* &quot;Rule 7 The logic is recursive&quot; : The logic is relational between two instances of the same entity.

The framework is generic in that it can be used to classify the descriptive representations of any physical object as well as conceptual objects such as enterprises. It is also recursive in that it can be used to analyze the architectural composition of itself. Although the framework will carry the relation from one column to the other, it is still a fundamentally structural representation of the enterprise and not a flow representation.

=== Flexibility in level of detail ===

One of the strengths of the Zachman Framework is that it explicitly shows a comprehensive set of views that can be addressed by enterprise architecture. Some feel that following this model completely can lead to too much emphasis on documentation, as artifacts would be needed for every one of the thirty cells in the framework. Zachman, however, indicates that only the facts needed to solve the problem under analysis need be populated.

John Zachman clearly states in his documentation, presentations, and seminars that, as framework, there is flexibility in what depth and breadth of detail is required for each cell of the matrix based upon the importance to a given organization. An automaker whose business goals may necessitate an inventory and process-driven focus, could find it beneficial to focus their documentation efforts on What and How columns. By contrast, a travel agent company, whose business is more concerned with people and event-timing, could find it beneficial to focus their documentation efforts on Who, When, and Where columns. However, there is no escaping the Why column&#x27;s importance as it provides the business drivers for all the other columns.

== Applications and influences ==
Since the 1990s the Zachman Framework has been widely used as a means of providing structure for information technology engineering-style enterprise modeling. The Zachman Framework can be applied both in commercial companies and in government agencies. Within a government organization the framework can be applied to an entire agency at an abstract level, or it can be applied to various departments, offices, programs, subunits and even to basic operational entities.

=== Customization ===
Zachman Framework is applied in customized frameworks such as the TEAF, built around the similar frameworks, the TEAF matrix.

Other sources:
* The TEAF matrix is called a customization sample, see &quot;here&quot;, p. 22

=== Standards based on the Zachman Framework ===
Zachman Framework is also used as a framework to describe standards, for example standards for healthcare and healthcare information system. Each cell of the framework contains such a series of standards for healthcare and healthcare information system.

=== Mapping other frameworks ===
Another application of the Zachman Framework is as reference model for other enterprise architectures, see for example these four: 
Other examples:
* Analysis of the Rational Unified Process as a Process,
* How the Model-driven architecture (MDA) models used in software development map to the Zachman Framework.
* Mapping the IEC 62264 models onto the Zachman framework for analysing products information traceability.
* Mapping the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (e.g. the methodology) to the Zachman Framework.

=== Base for other enterprise architecture frameworks ===
Less obvious are the ways the original Zachman framework has stimulated the development of other enterprise architecture frameworks, such as in the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model, the C4ISR AE, the DOE AE, and the DoDAF:

* The Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) is based on the Zachman Framework but only addresses the first three columns of Zachman, using slightly different names, and focuses in the top of the three rows. (see &quot;here&quot;)

==== Example: One-VA Enterprise Architecture ====
The Zachman Framework methodology has for example been used by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop and maintain its One-VA Enterprise Architecture in 2001. This methodology required defining all aspects of the VA enterprise from a business process, data, technical, location, personnel, and requirements perspective. The next step in implementing the methodology has been to define all functions related to each business process and identify associated data elements. Once identified, duplication of function and inconsistency in data definition can be identified and resolved, .

The Department of Veterans Affairs at the beginning of the 21st century planned to implement an enterprise architecture fully based on the Zachman Framework. 
* The Zachman Framework was used as a reference model to initiate enterprise architecture planning in 2001.
* Somewhere in between the VA Zachman Framework Portal was constructed.
* This VA Zachman Framework Portal is still in use as a reference model for example in the determination of EA information collected from various business and project source documents.
Eventually, an enterprise architecture repository was created at the macro level by the Zachman framework and at a cell level by the meta-model outlined below.

This diagram has been incorporated within the VA-EA to provide a symbolic representation of the metamodel it used, to describe the One-VA Enterprise Architecture and to build an EA Repository without the use of Commercial EA Repository Software. It was developed using an object oriented database within the Caliber-RM Software Product. Caliber-RM is intended to be used as a software configuration management tool; not as an EA repository.

However, this tool permitted defining entities and relationships and for defining properties upon both entities and relationships, which made it sufficient for building an EA repository, considering the technology available in early 2003. The personal motivation in selecting this tool was that none of the commercial repository tools then available provided a true Zachman Framework representation, and were highly proprietary, making it difficult to incorporate components from other vendors or from open source.

This diagram emphasizes several important interpretations of the Zachman Framework and its adaptation to information technology investment management. 
# Progressing through the rows from top to bottom, one can trace-out the systems development life cycle (SDLC) which is a de facto standard across the Information Industry;
# The diagram emphasizes the importance of the often-neglected Zachman Row-Six (the Integrated, Operational Enterprise View). Representations in Zuech&#x27;s interpretation of Zachman row-six consist, largely, of measurable service improvements and cost savings/avoidance that result from the business process and technology innovations that were developed across rows two through five.
Row-six provides measured return on investment for Individual Projects and, potentially, for the entire investment portfolio. Without row-six the Framework only identifies sunk-cost, but the row-six ROI permits it to measure benefits and to be used in a continuous improvement process, capturing best practices and applying them back through row-two.

== Criticism ==
While the Zachman Framework is widely discussed, its practical value has been questioned:
* The framework is purely speculative, non-empirical and based only on the conceptual argument that the &quot;equivalency [between the architectural representations of the manufacturing and construction industries] would strengthen the argument that an analogous set of architectural representations is &quot;likely&quot; to be produced during the process of building any complex engineering product, including an information system&quot;
* Practical feedback shows that the general idea of creating comprehensive descriptions of enterprises as suggested by the Zachman Framework is unrealistic
* In 2004 John Zachman admitted that the framework is theoretical and has never been fully implemented: &quot;If you ask who is successfully implementing the whole framework, the answer is nobody that we know of yet&quot;
* There are no detailed examples demonstrating the successful practical application of the framework
* EA practitioner Stanley Gaver argues that &quot;the analogy to classical architecture first made by John Zachman is faulty and incomplete&quot;
* Jason Bloomberg argues that &quot;enterprise isn&#x27;t an ordinary system like a machine or a building, and can&#x27;t be architected or engineered as such&quot;

This criticism suggests that the Zachman Framework can hardly reflect actual best practice in EA.

<text>James Edward Heath (October 25, 1926 – January 19, 2020), nicknamed Little Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist, composer, arranger, and big band leader. He was the brother of bassist Percy Heath and drummer Albert Heath.

==Biography==
Heath was born in Philadelphia on October 25, 1926. His father, an auto mechanic, played the clarinet, performing on the weekends. His mother sang in a church choir. The family frequently played recordings of big band jazz groups around the house. Heath&#x27;s sister was a pianist, while his brothers were bassist Percy Heath (older) and drummer Albert Heath (his youngest sibling).

During World War II, Heath was rejected for the draft for being below the minimum weight.

Heath originally played alto saxophone. He earned the nickname &quot;Little Bird&quot; after his work for Howard McGhee and Dizzy Gillespie in the late 1940s, during which his playing displayed influences from Charlie Parker (Parker&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Bird&quot;). He then switched to tenor saxophone.

From late 1945 through most of 1946, he performed with the Nat Towles band. In 1946, he formed his own band, which was a fixture on the Philadelphia jazz scene until 1949. The band included John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Specs Wright, Cal Massey, Johnny Coles, Ray Bryant, and Nelson Boyd. Charlie Parker and Max Roach sat in on one occasion. The band performed at venues such as the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Although Heath recalls that the band recorded a few demos on acetate, it never released any recordings, and its arrangements were lost at a Chicago train station. The band dissolved in 1949 so that Heath could join Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band.

Heath was arrested and convicted twice for the sale of heroin; he was an acknowledged addict. The first time, in the spring of 1954, he was sent to the Federal Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, where many musicians and celebrities (and other people) were given treatment. After release, In early 1955, still an addict, he was arrested again, and served most of a six-year prison sentence in Lewisburg. He went cold turkey, and was able to spend a lot of his time engaged in music. While in prison he actually composed most of the Chet Baker and Art Pepper album &quot;Playboys&quot; (1956). He was released early, on May 21, 1959, and remained clean for the rest of his life; conditions of probation made it difficult, but he managed to start rebuilding his career.

He briefly joined Miles Davis&#x27;s group in 1959, replacing Coltrane, and also worked with Kenny Dorham and Gil Evans. Heath recorded extensively as leader and sideman. During the 1960s, he frequently worked with Milt Jackson and Art Farmer.

In 1975, he and his brothers formed the Heath Brothers, also featuring pianist Stanley Cowell.

Jimmy Heath composed &quot;For Minors Only&quot;, &quot;Picture of Heath&quot;, &quot;Bruh&#x27; Slim&quot;, and &quot;CTA&quot; and recorded them on his 1975 album &quot;Picture of Heath&quot;.

In the 1980s, Heath joined the faculty of the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College, City University of New York. With the rank of Professor, he led the creation of the Jazz Program at Queens College and attracted prominent musicians such as Donald Byrd to the campus. He also served on the board of the Louis Armstrong Archives on campus, and the restoration and management of the Louis and Lucille Armstrong Residence in Corona, Queens, near his own home. In addition to teaching at Queens College for more than 20 years, he also taught at Jazzmobile.

==Personal life==
At a coming-home party the night after his release from Lewisburg Penitentiary, he met his eventual wife, Mona Brown, whom he married in 1960; they had two children, Roslyn and Jeffrey.

Heath was the father of R&amp;B songwriter/musician James Mtume.

In 2010 his autobiography &quot;I Walked With Giants&quot; was published by the Temple University Press. Heath stood just 5 feet, 3 inches.

He notably played in a jazz concert at the White House, when President Bill Clinton borrowed his saxophone for one number.

Heath died on January 19, 2020, in Loganville, Georgia, of natural causes.

== Awards and legacy ==
He received a Grammy nomination for box-set liner notes of &quot;The Heavyweight Champion, John Coltrane, the Complete Atlantic Recordings&quot; (Rhino, 1995), and Grammy nominations for &quot;Little Man Big Band&quot; (Verve, 1994) and &quot;Live at the Public Theatre&quot; with The Heath Brothers (Columbia, 1980).

Heath was a recipient of the 2003 NEA Jazz Masters Award. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Human Letters.

Heath worked on over 100 albums and wrote more than 125 compositions. Many have since become jazz standards, recorded by artists such as; Art Farmer, Cannonball Adderley, Clark Terry, Chet Baker, Miles Davis, James Moody, Milt Jackson, Ahmad Jamal, Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, J. J. Johnson, and Dexter Gordon. Heath also composed suites and string quartets, and a symphony, &quot;Three Ears&quot;, which premiered in 1988 at Queens College, with Maurice Peress conducting.

<text>Curtis James Martin Jr. (born May 1, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the New York Jets. He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers.

Martin spent his first NFL three seasons with the New England Patriots, who selected him in the third round of the 1995 NFL draft, and was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. Martin joined the Jets in 1998, where he spent eight seasons before retiring after spending the 2006 season rehabbing an injury. A five-time Pro Bowl selection and a first-team All-Pro, Martin is sixth in total NFL rushing yards. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012.
Martin is often regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time.

==Early life==
Curtis Jr. was born in Pittsburgh to Rochella Dixon and Curtis Sr. on May 1, 1973. Curtis Sr. left the family in 1978 after turning to drugs and alcohol, leaving Curtis&#x27;s mother to support the family by working three jobs. During his youth, Curtis often moved around the various neighborhoods of Pittsburgh and was consistently surrounded by violence. His grandmother, Eleanor Johnson, was found murdered with a knife in her chest; at age 15, Martin had a near-death experience when the trigger of a loaded gun pointed at his head was pulled seven times, but never fired.

He and his mother settled in Point Breeze prior to his sophomore year of high school. He began attending Taylor Allderdice High School which was known for its highly regarded academic reputation. He played basketball as a sophomore, but did not participate in any sports during his junior year. At the insistence of his mother, who wanted him to participate in an extracurricular activity as a way to keep him away from crime and violence, Curtis began to play football during his senior year, despite having never cared much for the sport.

Martin was considered a natural athlete, according to former head coach Mark Wittgartner and became an immediate star on the football team. He played at the running back and linebacker positions. He also played on special teams and occasionally at quarterback. He ran for 1,705 yards and scored 20 touchdowns in his lone season of high school football. Martin graduated from Allderdice in 1991 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2011.

Martin&#x27;s performance at Allderdice attracted the attention of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s football coach Paul Hackett. Though other offers were available, Martin decided to remain close to home and attend Pittsburgh.

==College career==
Martin, whom Hackett likened to Tony Dorsett, was expected to be a valued contributor to the Panthers when he arrived in 1991. However, injuries plagued much of his college career. As a junior, he rushed for 1,045 yards and caught 33 passes for 249 yards in ten games but he missed the final two with a sprained shoulder. In 1994, Martin opened his senior year running for a career-high 251 yards against Texas; however, the following week against Ohio he suffered a sprained ankle that sidelined him for the rest of the season.

Martin had the option to redshirt and play one more season at Pittsburgh or enter the NFL draft. He chose to enter the draft stating &quot;in the end it was the best thing to do&quot;. Draft analysts predicted that had Martin stayed another season at Pittsburgh and remained injury-free he could have been a potential first-round selection. Martin was highly touted for his speed—he ran a 4.4 in the 40-yard dash—and his slashing running style.

==Professional career==
=== New England Patriots ===
The Patriots lost three running backs to free agency upon the conclusion of the 1994 season and sought to fortify their backfield. One running back, Kevin Turner, was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as a restricted free agent and Philadelphia sent a third round selection to New England. The Patriots used the selection to draft Martin in the 1995 NFL draft despite concerns about his durability. Martin signed a contract with the team on July 19, 1995, and made his NFL debut in the Patriots&#x27; week one win over the Cleveland Browns. Martin ran for 30 yards on his first carry and finished with 102 yards for the day. He became the first Patriots rookie to rush for 100 yards during their debut. Martin continued his impressive streak and rushed for over 100 yards eight more times during the season. He finished the season as the AFC&#x27;s leading rusher with 1,487 yards and 14 touchdowns. He won the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award and was named to the Pro Bowl.

The following year, Martin only rushed for 100 yards twice during the season but recorded 1,152 yards and 14 rushing touchdowns. In the playoffs, Martin, playing in his first career playoff game, served as a key player in the Patriots&#x27; Divisional Playoff victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He rushed for a then franchise-record 166 yards and three touchdowns including a 78-yard touchdown, the second-longest touchdown run in playoff history at the time. The Patriots went on to play in Super Bowl XXXI, but lost to the Green Bay Packers. Martin rushed for 42 yards, caught three passes for 28 yards, and scored a touchdown in the game. It was at this game that a young Adrian Peterson fell in love with his hero Curtis Martin and vowed to wear the number 28 in his honor. Martin was again named to the Pro Bowl.

===New York Jets===
After the 1997 season, Martin became a restricted free agent. On the first day of the free agency period Martin&#x27;s agent, Eugene Parker, contacted the New York Jets to gauge their interest in potentially signing the running back. Negotiations ensued between Parker and Jets head coach and general manager Bill Parcells (who had left New England not long before) and an offer sheet was formulated. Though Martin had reservations about playing in New York and particularly for a division rival, the presence of his former coach Parcells influenced his decision to ultimately join the Jets. On March 20, 1998, Martin signed a six-year, $36-million poison pill contract. The &quot;poison pill&quot; was a clause in the contract that stated Martin would become an unrestricted free agent after one year if the Patriots matched the offer and it would have forced New England to pay a $3.3 million roster bonus that would have compromised their salary cap. Under these conditions, the Patriots did not match the offer; however, they received the Jets&#x27; first and third round selections in the 1998 NFL draft as compensation after filing a complaint with the NFL management council, claiming the offer sheet violated the terms of the league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement at the time.

In his first seven seasons with the Jets, Martin missed only one game and was selected to the Pro Bowl three times. In 1998, Martin gained 182 yards from scrimmage and scored two touchdowns against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a Jets playoff win. In 2004, Martin rushed for a season-high 196 yards against the Cincinnati Bengals in the team&#x27;s home opener, and would rush for over 100 yards eight more times that season, finishing with 1,697 yards. Martin won the NFL rushing title by one more yard than runner-up Shaun Alexander and became the oldest player, at age 31, in league history to win the rushing title. Martin was named the FedEx Ground Player of the Year and named an All-Pro and elected to his fifth and final Pro Bowl.

With the retirement of Emmitt Smith after 2004, Martin entered 2005 as the active leader in career rushing yards. In 2005, Martin suffered what was deemed as a strained right knee injury in the Jets&#x27; second game of the season against the Miami Dolphins, when he was tackled by linebacker Zach Thomas. An MRI of the knee was negative and Martin continued to play through the season despite a noticeable drop-off in production, having only rushed for 100 or more yards once the entire season. On November 27, 2005, Martin joined Barry Sanders, Walter Payton and Emmitt Smith as the only running backs to rush for 14,000 yards in their career. By December, the severity of the knee injury began to increase and Martin, despite wanting to become the second player (after Smith) to rush for 1,000 yards in 11 straight seasons, elected to have season-ending surgery, finishing with 735 yards on the season.
Martin began 2006 on the Physically Unable to Perform list as the post-operation recovery period took longer than expected though the surgery was considered minimally invasive. By November 2006, despite months of rehabilitation, Martin was declared out for the season with a bone-on-bone condition in his right knee. After re-negotiating his contract to help provide more salary cap room for the Jets, Martin announced his retirement in July 2007 thus ending his career having amassed 14,101 total rushing yards, the fifth highest total in NFL history.

===Post-retirement===
Following his retirement, Martin expressed interest in becoming the owner of an NFL franchise. He continued to involve himself in various charity work including through the Curtis Martin Job Foundation, established by Martin during his playing career, designed to provide &quot;financial aid and hands-on support to single mothers, children&#x27;s charities, individuals with disabilities and low income housing providers&quot;.

Martin was considered for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2011; however, he was not selected. Martin was again a leading candidate for selection in 2012 alongside former head coach and mentor Bill Parcells. He was selected for induction on February 4, 2012, and formally inducted on August 4, 2012. Martin&#x27;s speech, which he conducted without notes, was widely praised by critics for its sincerity.

The Jets retired Martin&#x27;s No. 28 jersey in a halftime ceremony at New York&#x27;s season-opening game against the Buffalo Bills on September 9, 2012.

On November 11, 2013, Martin was added to the Miami Dolphins&#x27; five-man committee to develop the conduct code by owner Stephen M. Ross following a locker room hazing incident involving Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin.

==Personal life==
In 1998, on Father&#x27;s Day, Martin and his mother Rochella began a long reconciliation process with his father, Curtis Sr., by renting a new, furnished condominium for his father, who had left the family due to his addictions to cocaine and alcohol. In 1990, Curtis Sr. checked into a veteran&#x27;s hospital for two weeks followed by a six-month stay at a rehabilitation center and was able to remain sober until his death from cancer, in June 2009 at age 58. The family members made peace with each other in the final weeks of the elder Martin&#x27;s life.

Martin married his longtime girlfriend Carolina Williams in a ceremony held at Oheka Castle in Huntington, Long Island in 2010. On December 15, 2011, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Ava.

Martin is a Christian. He became a Christian when he was 20 years old. He wore the number 28 because of Deuteronomy 28.

<doc id="793343" wikidata="Q3331086" url="?curid=793343" title="Mesangial cell">
<text>Mesangial cells are specialised cells in the kidney that make up the mesangium of the glomerulus. Together with the mesangial matrix, they form the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle. The mesangial cell population accounts for approximately 30-40% of the total cells in the glomerulus. Mesangial cells can be categorized as either extraglomerular mesangial cells or intraglomerular mesangial cells, based on their relative location to the glomerulus. The extraglomerular mesangial cells are found between the afferent and efferent arterioles towards the vascular pole of the glomerulus. The extraglomerular mesangial cells are adjacent to the intraglomerular mesangial cells that are located inside the glomerulus and in between the capillaries. The primary function of mesangial cells is to remove trapped residues and aggregated protein from the basement membrane thus keeping the filter free of debris. The contractile properties of mesangial cells have been shown to be insignificant in changing the filtration pressure of the glomerulus. 

==Structure==

Mesangial cells have irregular shapes with flattened-cylinder-like cell bodies and processes at both ends containing actin, myosin and actinin, giving mesangial cells contractile properties. The anchoring filaments from mesangial cells to the glomerular basement membrane can alter capillary flow by changing glomerular ultrafiltration surface area. Extraglomerular mesangial cells are in close connection to afferent and efferent arteriolar cells by gap junctions, allowing for intercellular communication. Mesangial cells are separated by intercellular spaces containing extracellular matrix called the mesangial matrix that is produced by the mesangial cells. Mesangial matrix provides structural support for the mesangium. Mesangial matrix is composed of glomerular matrix proteins such as collagen IV (α1 and α2 chains), collagen V, collagen VI, laminin A, B1, B2, fibronectin, and proteoglycans.

==Development== 
It is unclear whether the mesangial cells originate from mesenchymal or stromal cells. However there is evidence suggesting that they originate elsewhere outside of the glomerulus and then migrate into the glomerulus during development. Human foetal and infant kidneys stained for alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker for mesangial cells, demonstrated that α-SMA-positive mesenchymal cells migrate towards the glomerulus and during a later stage they can be found within the mesangium. It is possible that they share the same origin as supporting cells such as pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, or even be a type of specialised vascular smooth muscle cell.

==Function==

===Formation of capillary loops during development===
During development mesangial cells are important in the formation of convoluted capillaries allowing for efficient diffusion to occur. Endothelial precursor cells secrete platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B and mesangial cells have receptors for PDGF. This induces mesangial cells to attach to endothelial cells causing developing blood vessels to loop resulting in convoluted capillaries. Mice lacking the growth factor PDGF-B or PDGFRβ do not develop mesangial cells. When mesangial cells are absent the blood vessel becomes a single dilated vessel with up to 100-fold decrease in surface area. The transcription factor for PDGFRβ, Tbx18, is crucial for the development of mesangial cells. Without Tbx18 the development of mesangial cells is compromised and results in the formation of dilated loops. Mesangial cell progenitors are also a target of PDGF-B and can be selected for by the signal to then develop into mesangial cells.

===Interactions with other renal cells===
Mesangial cells form a glomerular functional unit with glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes through interactions of molecular signalling pathways which are essential for the formation of the glomerular tuft. Mesangial cells aid filtration by constituting part of the glomerular capillary tuft structure that filters fluids to produce urine. Communication between mesangial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells via gap junctions helps regulate the process of tubuloglomerular feedback and urine formation. Damage to mesangial cells using Thy 1-1 antibody specific to mesangial cells causes the vasoconstriction of arterioles mediated by tubuloglomerular feedback to be lost.

===Contractions regulate capillary flow===
Mesangial cells can contract and relax to regulate capillary flow. This is regulated by vasoactive substances. Contraction of mesangial cells is dependent on cell membrane permeability to calcium ions and relaxation is mediated by paracrine factors, hormones and cAMP. In response to capillary stretching, mesangial cells can respond by producing several growth factors: TGF-1, VEGF and connective tissue growth factor.

===Removal of macromolecules===
The mesangium is exposed to macromolecules from the capillary lumen as they are separated only by fenestrated endothelium without basement membrane. Mesangial cells play a role in restricting macromolecules from accumulating in the mesangial space by receptor- independent uptake processes of phagocytosis, micro- and macro-pinocytosis, or receptor-dependent processes and then transported along the mesangial stalk. Size, charge, concentration, and affinity for mesangial cell receptors of the macromolecule affects how the macromolecule is removed. Triglycerides may undergo pinocytosis and antibody IgG complexes may lead to activation of adhesion molecules and chemokines by mesangial cells.
They also regulate glomerular filtration.

==Clinical significance==

===Diabetic nephropathy===
The expansion of mesangial matrix is one characteristic of diabetic nephropathy although it also involves other cells in interaction including podocytes and endothelial cells. Mesangial expansion occurs due to increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, for example fibronectin, into the mesangium. Accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins then occurs due to insufficient degradation by matrix metalloproteinases.

Increased glucose levels results in the activation of metabolic pathways leading to increased oxidative stress. This in turn results in the over-production and accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products responsible for enhancing the risk of developing glomerular diseases. Mesangial cells grown on advanced glycosylation end product-modified matrix proteins demonstrate increased production of fibronectin and a decrease in proliferation. These factors eventually lead to the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial matrix expansion then glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis.

Mesangial pathologies may also develop during the early phase of diabetes. Glomerular hypertension causes mesangial cells to stretch which causes induced expression of GLUT1 leading to increased cellular glucose. The repetition of stretching and relaxation cycle of mesangial cells due to hypertension increases mesangial cell proliferation and the production of extracellular matrix which can then accumulate and lead to glomerular disease.

<text>The Heath Brothers was an American jazz group, formed in 1975 in Philadelphia, by the brothers Jimmy (tenor saxophone), Percy (bass), and Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath (drums); and pianist Stanley Cowell. Tony Purrone (guitar) and Mtume (percussion) joined the group later. Tootie left in 1978, and was replaced by Akira Tana for a short period, before returning in 1982. They also added other sidemen for some of their recording dates.

The group issued four singles between 1978 and 1981, &quot;Mellowdrama&quot;, &quot;For the Public&quot;, &quot;Use it (Don&#x27;t Abuse it)&quot; and &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, a track from the 1980 LP, &quot;Expressions of Life&quot;, had the most airplay in the UK despite not reaching the UK chart.

The group with just two of the brothers, Jimmy and Tootie, and additional sidemen as needed, continued to perform and record after Percy died in 2005. The DVD, &quot;Brotherly Jazz: The Heath Brothers&quot;, recorded in 2004, shortly before Percy&#x27;s death, was one of the last times the three brothers played together, and chronicled the brothers&#x27; personal lives, as well as socio-political issues many jazz musicians dealt with in the later 20th century, including jail, drugs, discrimination and segregation. The 2009 CD &quot;Endurance&quot; was the first without Percy, and features seven original numbers by Jimmy, including &quot;From a Lonely Bass&quot;, composed in memory of his late brother.

Percy Heath died on April 28, 2005. Jimmy Heath died on January 19, 2020. Tootie died on April 3, 2024.

<doc id="793367" wikidata="Q629941" url="?curid=793367" title="Arbitrage pricing theory">
<text>In finance, arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is a multi-factor model for asset pricing which relates various macro-economic (systematic) risk variables to the pricing of financial assets. Proposed by economist Stephen Ross in 1976, it is widely believed to be an improved alternative to its predecessor, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). APT is founded upon the law of one price, which suggests that within an equilibrium market, rational investors will implement arbitrage such that the equilibrium price is eventually realised. As such, APT argues that when opportunities for arbitrage are exhausted in a given period, then the expected return of an asset is a linear function of various factors or theoretical market indices, where sensitivities of each factor is represented by a factor-specific beta coefficient or factor loading. Consequently, it provides traders with an indication of ‘true’ asset value and enables exploitation of market discrepancies via arbitrage. The linear factor model structure of the APT is used as the basis for evaluating asset allocation, the performance of managed funds as well as the calculation of cost of capital. Furthermore, the newer APT model is more dynamic being utilised in more theoretical application than the preceding CAPM model. A 1986 article written by Gregory Connor and Robert Korajczyk, utilised the APT framework and applied it to portfolio performance measurement suggesting that the Jensen coefficient is an acceptable measurement of portfolio performance.

==Model==

APT is a single-period static model, which helps investors understand the trade-off between risk and return. The average investor aims to optimise the returns for any given level or risk and as such, expects a positive return for bearing greater risk. As per the APT model, risky asset returns are said to follow a &quot;factor intensity structure&quot; if they can be expressed as:
:formula_1

:where
:*formula_2 is a constant for asset formula_3.
:*formula_4 is a systematic factor for 1≤i≤n.
:*formula_5 is the sensitivity of the formula_3th asset to factor formula_4, 1≤i≤n, also called factor loading.
:* and formula_8 is the risky asset&#x27;s idiosyncratic random shock with mean zero.

Idiosyncratic shocks are assumed to be uncorrelated across assets and uncorrelated with the factors.

The APT model states that if asset returns follow a factor structure then the following relation exists between expected returns and the factor sensitivities:

:formula_9

:where
:* formula_10 is the risk premium of factor formula_4.
:* formula_12 is the risk-free rate.

That is, the expected return of an asset &quot;j&quot; is a linear function of the asset&#x27;s sensitivities to the &quot;n&quot; factors.

Note that there are some assumptions and requirements that have to be fulfilled for the latter to be correct: There must be perfect competition in the market, and the total number of factors may never surpass the total number of assets (in order to avoid the problem of matrix singularity).

=== General Model ===
For a set of assets with returns formula_13, factor loadings formula_14, and factors formula_15, a general factor model that is used in APT is:formula_16where formula_17 follows a multivariate normal distribution. In general, it is useful to assume that the factors are distributed as:formula_18where formula_19 is the expected risk premium vector and formula_20 is the factor covariance matrix. Assuming that the noise terms for the returns and factors are uncorrelated, the mean and covariance for the returns are respectively:formula_21It is generally assumed that we know the factors in a model, which allows least squares to be utilized. However, an alternative to this is to assume that the factors are latent variables and employ factor analysis - akin to the form used in psychometrics - to extract them.

=== Assumptions of APT Model ===
The APT model for asset valuation is founded on the following assumptions:

# Investors are risk-averse in nature and possess the same expectations
# Efficient markets with limited opportunity for arbitrage
# Perfect capital markets
# Infinite number of assets
# Risk factors are indicative of systematic risks that cannot be diversified away and thus impact all financial assets, to some degree. Thus, these factors must be:     
#* Non-specific to any individual firm or industry
#* Compensated by the market via a risk premium
#* A random variable

==Arbitrage==
Arbitrage is the practice whereby investors take advantage of slight variations in asset valuation from its fair price, to generate a profit. It is the realisation of a positive expected return from overvalued or undervalued securities in the inefficient market without any incremental risk and zero additional investments.

===Mechanics===
In the APT context, arbitrage consists of trading in two assets – with at least one being mispriced. The arbitrageur sells the asset which is relatively too expensive and uses the proceeds to buy one which is relatively too cheap.

Under the APT, an asset is mispriced if its current price diverges from the price predicted by the model. The asset price today should equal the sum of all future cash flows discounted at the APT rate, where the expected return of the asset is a linear function of various factors, and sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor-specific beta coefficient.

A correctly priced asset here may be in fact a &quot;synthetic&quot; asset - a &quot;portfolio&quot; consisting of other correctly priced assets. This portfolio has the same exposure to each of the macroeconomic factors as the mispriced asset. The arbitrageur creates the portfolio by identifying n correctly priced assets (one per risk-factor, plus one) and then weighting the assets such that portfolio beta per factor is the same as for the mispriced asset.

When the investor is long the asset and short the portfolio (or vice versa) he has created a position which has a positive expected return (the difference between asset return and portfolio return) and which has a net zero exposure to any macroeconomic factor and is therefore risk free (other than for firm specific risk). The arbitrageur is thus in a position to make a risk-free profit:

==Difference between the capital asset pricing model==
The APT along with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is one of two influential theories on asset pricing. The APT differs from the CAPM in that it is less restrictive in its assumptions, making it more flexible for use in a wider range of application. Thus, it possesses greator explanatory power (as opposed to statistical) for expected asset returns. It assumes that each investor will hold a unique portfolio with its own particular array of betas, as opposed to the identical &quot;market portfolio&quot;. In some ways, the CAPM can be considered a &quot;special case&quot; of the APT in that the securities market line represents a single-factor model of the asset price, where beta is exposed to changes in value of the market.

Fundamentally, the CAPM is derived on the premise that all factors in the economy can be reconciled into one factor represented by a market portfolio, thus implying they all have equivalent weight on the asset’s return. In contrast, the APT model suggests that each stock reacts uniquely to various macroeconomic factors and thus the impact of each must be accounted for separately.

A disadvantage of APT is that the selection and the number of factors to use in the model is ambiguous. Most academics use three to five factors to model returns, but the factors selected have not been empirically robust. In many instances the CAPM, as a model to estimate expected returns, has empirically outperformed the more advanced APT.

Additionally, the APT can be seen as a &quot;supply-side&quot; model, since its beta coefficients reflect the sensitivity of the underlying asset to economic factors. Thus, factor shocks would cause structural changes in assets&#x27; expected returns, or in the case of stocks, in firms&#x27; profitabilities.

On the other side, the capital asset pricing model is considered a &quot;demand side&quot; model. Its results, although similar to those of the APT, arise from a maximization problem of each investor&#x27;s utility function, and from the resulting market equilibrium (investors are considered to be the &quot;consumers&quot; of the assets).

==Implementation==

As with the CAPM, the factor-specific betas are found via a linear regression of historical security returns on the factor in question. Unlike the CAPM, the APT, however, does not itself reveal the identity of its priced factors - the number and nature of these factors is likely to change over time and between economies. As a result, this issue is essentially empirical in nature. Several &quot;a priori&quot; guidelines as to the characteristics required of potential factors are, however, suggested: 
# their impact on asset prices manifests in their &quot;unexpected&quot; movements and they are completely unpredictable to the market at the beginning of each period 
# they should represent &quot;undiversifiable&quot; influences (these are, clearly, more likely to be macroeconomic rather than firm-specific in nature) on expected returns and so must be quantifiable with non-zero prices 
# timely and accurate information on these variables is required
# the relationship should be theoretically justifiable on economic grounds

Chen, Roll and Ross identified the following macro-economic factors as significant in explaining security returns:

*surprises in inflation;
*surprises in GNP as indicated by an industrial production index;
*surprises in investor confidence due to changes in default premium in corporate bonds;
*surprise shifts in the yield curve.

As a practical matter, indices or spot or futures market prices may be used in place of macro-economic factors, which are reported at low frequency (e.g. monthly) and often with significant estimation errors. Market indices are sometimes derived by means of factor analysis. More direct &quot;indices&quot; that might be used are:
*short-term interest rates;
*the difference in long-term and short-term interest rates;
*a diversified stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 or NYSE Composite;
*oil prices
*gold or other precious metal prices
*Currency exchange rates

==International arbitrage pricing theory==

International arbitrage pricing theory (IAPT) is an important extension of the base idea of arbitrage pricing theory which further considers factors such as exchange rate risk. In 1983 Bruno Solnik created an extension of the original arbitrage pricing theory to include risk related to international exchange rates hence making the model applicable international markets with multi-currency transactions. Solnik suggested that there may be several factors common to all international assets, and conversely, there may be other common factors applicable to certain markets based on nationality.

Fama and French originally proposed a three-factor model in 1995 which, consistent with the suggestion from Solnik above suggests that integrated international markets may experience a common set of factors, hence making it possible to price assets in all integrated markets using their model. The Fama and French three factor model attempts to explain stock returns based on market risk, size, and value.

A 2012 paper aimed to empirically investigate Solnik’s IAPT model and the suggestion that base currency fluctuations have a direct and comprehendible effect on the risk premiums of assets. This was tested by generating a returns relation which broke down individual investor returns into currency and non-currency (universal) returns. The paper utilised Fama and French’s three factor model (explained above) to estimate international currency impacts on common factors. It was concluded that the total foreign exchange risk in international markets consisted of the immediate exchange rate risk and the residual market factors. This, along with empirical data tests validates the idea that foreign currency fluctuations have a direct effect on risk premiums and the factor loadings included in the APT model, hence, confirming the validity of the IAPT model.

<doc id="793384" wikidata="Q1752677" url="?curid=793384" title="Carbonic maceration">
<text>Carbonic maceration is a winemaking technique, often associated with the French wine region of Beaujolais, in which whole grapes are fermented in a carbon dioxide rich environment before crushing. Conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol. Carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape, although grapes at the bottom of the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation. The resulting wine is fruity with very low tannins. It is ready to drink quickly but lacks the structure for long-term aging. In extreme cases such as Beaujolais nouveau, the period between picking and bottling can be less than six weeks.

During carbonic maceration, an environment is created by pumping carbon dioxide into a sealed container filled with whole grape clusters. The carbon dioxide gas permeates through the grape skins and begins to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level. The entire process takes place inside each intact berry. Ethanol is produced as a by-product of this process but studies have shown that other unique chemical reactions take place that have a distinctive effect on the wine.

==History==
The process of carbonic maceration occurs naturally in a partial state without deliberate intervention and has occurred in some form throughout history. If grapes are stored in a closed container, the force of gravity will crush those at the bottom, releasing grape juice. Ambient yeasts present on the grape skins will interact with the sugars in the grape juice to start conventional ethanol fermentation. Carbon dioxide is released as a by-product and, being denser than oxygen, will push out the oxygen through any permeable surface (such as slight gaps between wood planks), creating a mostly anaerobic environment for the uncrushed grape clusters to go through carbonic maceration. Some of the earliest documented studies of the process were conducted by the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who noted in 1872 that grapes contained in an oxygen-rich environment before crushing and fermentation produced wines of different flavors than grapes produced in a carbon dioxide-rich environment. This was because the fermentation process had already started within the individual grape clusters before yeasts were introduced during conventional fermentation.

==Wine production==
The use of carbonic maceration is closely associated with the production of Beaujolais nouveau wine from the Gamay grape in the Beaujolais region and some wines in the Rioja Alavesa and Jumilla areas of Spain. This grape lends itself well to the production of simple, fruity wines and Beaujolais winemakers have been able to create a unique identity based on this distinctive style.

Producers in other parts of France and in the New World have frequently utilized carbonic maceration for their own Gamay production, or with other grape varieties. Winemakers in the Languedoc and Rhône wine regions will sometimes employ the technique on coarse and tannic grapes like Carignan, especially if they are to be blended with other varieties. In California, the process is sometimes used with Valdiguié grapes, producing what is labeled a &quot;Nouveau&quot; wine.

The process is almost always used in conjunction with red wine production since some of the flavor compounds produced by volatile phenols tend to form undesirable flavors with white wine grape varieties.

===Other techniques===
Semi-carbonic maceration is the winemaking technique where grapes are put through a short period of carbonic maceration, followed by conventional yeast fermentations. This is the process used in producing Beaujolais nouveau wines. To an extent, most wines were historically treated to some form of semi or partial carbonic fermentation (as noted in the history section above) with the amount depending on the shape and size of the vessel the grapes were stored in before crushing. The deeper the vessel, the greater the proportion of grapes that could be exposed to an anaerobic environment caused by the release of carbon dioxide from the crushed grapes on the bottom.

An alternative name for carbonic maceration is &quot;whole grape fermentation&quot;, which is distinct from the process of &quot;whole bunch fermentation&quot; common in the Burgundy wine production of Pinot noir. With &quot;whole bunch fermentation&quot;, whole clusters of grapes (including stems) are fermented before being crushed. This builds a large &quot;cap&quot; of grape skins, with pathways created by the stems, allowing juice to flow more evenly through caps, increasing the levels of skin contact, or maceration.

==Coffee production==
Carbonic maceration techniques (e.g. semi-carbonic maceration) have recently been adapted to coffee processing. The ripe coffee cherries are placed inside a hermetic stainless steel tank and left to undergo an anaerobic fermentation. This fermentation process brings out intense aromas, with a taste profile akin to red wine and whisky. These coffee beans usually produce a full-body cup. Known varieties processed with semi-carbonic maceration are Red and Yellow Catuai. Details of fermentation techniques have recently appeared in various specialty coffee media.

<text>A BNC (short for Bounced Network Connection) is a piece of software that is used to relay traffic and connections in computer networks, much like a proxy. Using a BNC allows a user to hide the original source of the user&#x27;s connection, providing privacy as well as the ability to route traffic through a specific location. A BNC can also be used to hide the true target to which a user connects.

== IRC ==
One common usage is over Internet Relay Chat (IRC) via a BNC running on remote servers. In such an environment, where it is very easy to ascertain a user&#x27;s IP address a BNC may help to hide the original connection source, as well as providing the opportunity for &quot;vhosts&quot; or &quot;virtual hosts&quot;. The use of a vhost does not conceal the connection any better but merely adds a statement as the hostname.

Many BNCs remain connected to an IRC server in the event the client should disconnect from the Internet. Often state changes are tracked so that they may be relayed to the client upon reconnection. Some implementations opt to store all messages sent across the network that the client would have normally received and send them upon the client&#x27;s reconnection; this is often considered to be much too resource dependent for commercial hosting services to provide. Other logging features and bot like functions may be included with various implementations but are not standard.

===Example===

:User A logs onto IRC directly and appears as codice_1
:User A logs onto IRC indirectly through a BNC and appears as codice_2

=== Software ===
A list of bouncers.

* ZNC (IRC) is a popular IRC bouncer, written in C++, in development since July 2004.
* soju is a user-friendly IRC bouncer, written in Go, with support for chat history playback and file uploads, in development since 2020.
* The Lounge acts both as an IRC client and an IRC bouncer.

=== Hosted services ===
Several companies offer hosted IRC bouncer services:

* IRCCloud is an IRC bouncer based on proprietary software, with its own web and mobile IRC clients. It is developed mainly for teams and can be bridged with Slack (software).
* IRC Today is a commercial IRC bouncer based on the open source software soju. It features an intuitive web configuration interface and enables file upload directly from the IRC client.
* chat.sr.ht is another commercial IRC bouncer based on soju. It is part of a minimalistic software suite targeted at developers.

== FTP ==

BNCs are also often used for File Transfer Protocol (FTP), again to hide the user and server from each other and to route traffic through a specific location. FTP bouncers can be divided into two different categories, entry and traffic.

An entry bouncer acts as a gateway to the server, but it does not hide the existence of the actual server. Entry bouncers, like cubnc, can be used in a multiserver setup for easy access to each server and load balancing. This removes the need to select which FTP server to log into, when trying to access the server farm.

Traffic bouncers relay traffic through the host they are installed on and present themselves as if they were the FTP server, thus hiding the real location of the server completely. Multiple traffic bouncers can be installed parallel in order to balance traffic load across different links. Most elaborate bouncers can even bounce secure SSL/TLS connections.

<doc id="793396" wikidata="Q18643" url="?curid=793396" title="Motu proprio">
<text>In law,  (Latin for &#x27;on his own impulse&#x27;) describes an official act taken without a formal request from another party. Some jurisdictions use the term for the same concept.

In Catholic canon law, it refers to a document issued by the pope on his own initiative and personally signed by him. Such a document may be addressed to the whole church, to part of it, or to some individuals. The first papal was promulgated by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. It continues to be a common form of papal rescript, especially when establishing institutions, making minor changes to law or procedure, and when granting favours to persons or institutions.

== Catholic Church ==

=== Effect ===
An important effect of issuing a document in this way is that a rescript containing the clause is valid and produces its effect even in cases where fraud would ordinarily have vitiated the document, since the pope does not rely on the reasons alleged when he grants a favour. Withholding of the truth in what, according to canonical law, style and practice, must for validity be expressed, normally renders a rescript invalid, but not if the rescript is issued &quot;motu proprio&quot;. Consequently, canonists traditionally called the clause the &quot;mother of repose&quot;. The designation indicates that the validity of the document is independent of the validity of whatever reasons may have been adduced in a request for its issuance.

However, a has no effect in so far as it harms the acquired right of another or is contrary to a law or approved custom, unless it expressly states that it is derogating from these matters.

=== Form ===
A rescript begins by giving the reasons for issuing it, and then indicates the law or regulation made or the favour granted. It is less formal than a constitution and carries no papal seal. Its content may be instructional (e.g., on the use of chant), administrative (e.g., concerning a church law or the establishment of a commission), or merely to confer a special favour.

==Civil law==

More generically, this phrase (or ; Latin allows free word order) is used to indicate an act taken by a court without a motion from a party to the case. The term is used very rarely in legal opinions in the United States, where is preferred, but is used in Canada. is used to refer to a decision by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to initiate an investigation into a situation without a referral from the Security Council or a state party; this power is granted by article 15(1) of the Rome Statute. European Court of Justice judgments use the phrase &quot;of its own motion&quot; and its equivalent in other community languages.

As it relates to a monarch, the term describes the condition of a royal decree being made expressly on the sovereign&#x27;s initiative, a practice more usual in some nations than in others.

Relating to orders of chivalry, like the Order of Malta, the grand master according to the statutes can confer the order , instead of in response to a nomination by a national delegation.

<text>David Devant &amp; His Spirit Wife are an English indie/art rock band from Brighton, England. They are named after the English magician and early film exhibitor, David Devant (1868–1941).

==History==

The band were formed in Brighton in May 1992 by Mikey Georgeson, songwriter, singer, guitarist and keyboard player, Foz Foster, the ex-guitarist of the Monochrome Set, Jem Egerton, a classically trained musician, who played bass, and the drummer Graham Carlow. Georgeson derived the name for his band from a second-hand copy of &quot;My Magic Life&quot;, the autobiography of the great English stage magician, David Devant (1868–1941). One of Devant&#x27;s stage illusions was to produce a floating apparition of his ‘spirit wife’. Georgeson told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;I knew it was lazy just to nick the name, David Devant and His Spirit Wife, so I decided to research the man. I read the book and his nickname at school was the same as mine – Monkey Face… Our motto – like his – is All Done by Kindness.&quot;.

Georgeson explained the idea behind the band to the Brighton &quot;Punter&quot; magazine: &quot;It&#x27;s quite simple really, as a magician Devant didn&#x27;t really fulfil himself so he said &#x27;I shall walk down the corridors of contemporary music&#x27;, so he chose us. I am his vessel.&quot;- hence Georgeson&#x27;s new stage name, The Vessel. The rest of the band also assumed new names: The Colonel (Egerton), Professor Rimschott (Carlow), and Foz? (pronounced &#x27;Foz Questionmark&#x27;). The line-up was completed by &quot;the Lantern&quot;, who provided film and light, and two &quot;Spectral Roadies&quot;, known as IceMAN (Nick Curry) and Cocky Young&#x27;un (Gary Smith), who accompanied the music with visual jokes and magic using cardboard props.

In concert, the Vessel, who wore a black pompadour Elvis wig and a pencil moustache, might appear flying on a magic carpet, projected as a shadow on a paper screen, or be sawn in half by the roadies. At one Halloween concert, at the Duke of York&#x27;s Picture House, Brighton, he was fired out of a cannon from the stage, emerging at the far end of the hall in tattered clothes, his face blackened. The climax of every show was the appearance of the Spirit Wife, manifested in the form of a Victorian lace nightgown waved on a pole, while the audience was instructed, &#x27;Don Spirit Specs Now!&#x27;

In 1997, David Devant and His Spirit Wife featured as the house band on Paramount Channel&#x27;s television series Asylum. They provided the title music and performed a different song in every episode.

After the 1997 release of their first album, &quot;Work, Lovelife, Miscellaneous&quot;, the Radio One Breakfast DJ, Mark Radcliffe, told the Sunday Times, &#x27;Initially I was intrigued by the look of them, by the name, by the image. Then I heard some really good songs. It certainly helps that they sound like early Bowie. Since most people will never see the band play, unless the records themselves work there is no point to all the theatricality. But this lot are messing about with the concept of what makes a pop band. Their act isn&#x27;t just a gimmick. We need more bands like them.&#x27;

Touring their first album around Britain, the band was accompanied by a Channel 4 film crew from The Other Side series. &quot;David Devant and His Spirit Wife&quot;, directed by Ashley Hames, was shown in 1999. It marked a farewell to the first incarnation of David Devant as, in the final sequence, filmed in 1999, Georgeson symbolically set fire to his wig.

On 11 December 1999, at The Falcon in Camden, Georgeson unveiled a new David Devant, stripped of the theatricality of the earlier version. The Spectral roadies and the Vessel&#x27;s wig had gone, and Foz? had been replaced by John Pope on guitar. The accompanying album, &quot;Shiney on the Inside&quot;, had a harder-edged sound, with driving glam-inspired anthems, &quot;Radar&quot; and &quot;Space Daddy&quot;. Eddie Argos, of another art-rock band, Art Brut, would later describe &quot;Shiney on the Inside&quot; as &#x27;one of the greatest albums ever made.&#x27;

In 2002, the original line-up of David Devant reunited, beginning with a concert at Komedia Brighton, on 8 April. A third album was released, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Power Words for Better Living&quot;.

On 11 December 2019, the band released their fourth album, &quot;Cut Out and Keep Me&quot;, on Kindness records, with a show at the Water Rats in London. The Mild Mannered Army review described the album as delivering &#x27;moments of autobiography, philosophy, surrealism and all coated in beautiful arrangements, classic pop hooks, rock and roll history and a tangible sense that all of this has happened because of kindness...“Cut Out and Keep Me” is a return to the bands own past, the closest in sound and presentation to “Work, Lovelife, Miscellaneous” of any of their other albums. Songs like the titular &#x27;Cut Out and Keep Me&#x27;, &#x27;Here I Am&#x27;, &#x27;Rough Magic&#x27;, &#x27;Sublime&#x27; and &#x27;Early Worm&#x27; are all light on the surface but with darkness lurking in the depths.&#x27;

==Side projects==
Performing as Mr Solo, Georgeson has made appearances as part of This Happy Band, a loose collective of artists, poets and musicians who have performed together at art events including &#x27;Dead Season / Live Art&#x27; for Limbo Arts in Margate and Nunhead Open Exhibition 2009 and 2011.

<text>Wallangarra is a rural town and locality in the Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia on the border with New South Wales. 
It is the third-most southerly town in Queensland, south west of Brisbane. Wallangarra is on the Queensland side of the border and Jennings is on the New South Wales side.

In the , the locality of Wallangarra had a population of 440 people.

== History ==
In 1885, the Queensland Government announced that a town would be formed where the railway line between Queensland and New South Wales would meet. On 29 June 1885, 179 lots were offered for sale at . The town would provide a break-of-gauge between Queensland&#x27;s narrow gauge Southern railway line of and New South Wales&#x27;s standard gauge Main North railway line of when the two systems came together in 1888. Two railway stations were created within the area. One was named Wallan-garra railway station () and the town took its name from the station but used the spelling Wallangarra (with most people using the same spelling for the railway station). Bald Mountain railway station () was the other railway station and is now abandoned.

Wallangarra Provisional School opened on 13 February 1888. On 1 January 1909, it became Wallangarra State School.

On 28 January 1919, the Queensland Government placed restrictions on the border crossing at Wallangarra to prevent the spread of the Spanish flu into Queensland, which were enforced by the Queensland Police. A medical screening process was used to determine if Queensland residents could safely return to the state.

The railway was the only rail link between Queensland and New South Wales until a standard gauge track was completed via Kyogle in 1930, with the completion of the bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton. From that time on, the Wallangarra railway station lessened in importance. Scheduled rail services ended in 1997. In 2003, after major refurbishment, the station was reopened as a museum. The railway line from Stanthorpe to Wallangarra has continued to be maintained and steam trains taking tourists to Wallangarra occasionally operate.

The Anderson Meat Packing Company was restarted by Mr. A.W. Anderson in 1938 after a 15-month closure. Until 1982 it operated a large beef abattoir at Wallangarra. Anderson&#x27;s employed in excess of 400 workers at the Wallangarra plant. The plant was located on the border so as to take advantage of rail lines from both Queensland and NSW.

During World War II, the Commonwealth Government created a general army store on the Queensland side of the border, and an ammunition dump on the New South Wales side. Dual gauge tracks were run to each store. Access to the army stores was via Margetts St, one of the main roads in the town. The late Muriel Daphne Verdun Nicolson lived at 30 Margetts St from before WWII until her death in 2001. During WWII she reported that the flow of trucks and materiel went on all day and night.

Wallangarra Cemetery was established in 1953.

On 12 September 1964, St Gabrielle&#x27;s Anglican Church was dedicated by Bishop John Hudson. Its closure circa 2013 was approved by Bishop Robert Nolan. The church building was sold into private ownership for $210,000 in October 2014, but remains at 54 Merinda Street ().

Taking advantage of the rail junction Riverina Stock Feeds operated a packing plant opposite the Wallangarra railway station for many years until 1995. After that it moved to Warwick, a city to the north. Warwick also has a major Woolworths warehouse. The Chairman of Woolworths who located the warehouse at Warwick grew up in Wallangarra.

Circa 2005, Thomas Foods International opened Australia&#x27;s largest mutton works opened on a new site just to the east of the town. The mutton produced is Halal, and most of it is exported to Arab countries. The abattoir shut down in July 2016 for &quot;the short to medium term&quot; blaming low stock numbers and poor global trading conditions.

== Geography ==
Wallangarra lies in a valley between two ranges of mountains, which are branches of the Great Dividing Range. It is above sea level. There is a gap between the more Westerly range at Wyberba, about five kilometres north of Wallangarra. This gap has made Wallangarra the major inland border crossing for the New England Highway and what was the first railway line between Brisbane and Sydney. It is situated on the northern periphery of the New England Peppermint Grassy Woodland.

== Climate ==

Wallangarra is the coldest town by mean maximum temperature in Queensland, due to its altitude and extreme southern location in the state. Maximum temperatures average in winter and in summer. Wallangarra holds the record for the lowest maximum temperature in Queensland, on 3 July 1984. However due to its exposed location, minimum temperatures are not particularly low; towns of significantly lower altitude such as Warwick and Oakey frequently record lower minima, and especially Stanthorpe of similar altitude but much flatter topography − which in turn causes warmer daytime temperatures and less snowfall compared to Wallangarra.

<text> (), also potestate or podesta in English, was the name given to the holder of the highest civil office in the government of the cities of central and northern Italy during the Late Middle Ages. Sometimes, it meant the chief magistrate of a city-state, the counterpart to similar positions in other cities that went by other names, e.g. (&#x27;rectors&#x27;). 

In the following centuries up to 1918, the term was used to designate the head of the municipal administration, particularly in the Italian-speaking territories of the Austrian Empire. The title was taken up again during the Fascist regime with the same meaning.

The &#x27;s office, its duration and the residence and the local jurisdiction were called , especially during the Middle Ages, and in later centuries, more rarely during the Fascist regime.

Currently, is the title of mayors in Italian-speaking municipalities of Graubünden in Switzerland, but it is not the case for the Canton of Ticino, which uses the title (the same currently in use throughout Italy).

==Etymology==
The term derives from the Latin word (&#x27;power&#x27;). There is a similar derivation for the Arabic term , originally meaning &#x27;power&#x27; or &#x27;authority&#x27;; it eventually became the title of the person holding power.

==History==
The first documented usage of was in Bologna in 1151, when it was applied to Guido di Ranieri di Sasso of Canossa, brought in from Faenza to be , noted in numerous documents. Leander Albertus gives the particulars:


 were first more widely appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa when he began to assert the rights that his Imperial position gave him over the cities of northern Italy; at the second imperial diet at Roncaglia, November 1158, Frederick appointed in several major cities imperial &quot;as if having imperial power in that place&quot;. The elected consuls, which Frederick had claimed the right to ratify, began to designate directly. The business of the was to enforce imperial rights. From the start, this was very unpopular, and their often arbitrary behaviour was a factor in bringing about the formation of the Lombard League and the uprising against Frederick in 1167.

Although the Emperor&#x27;s experiment was short-lived, the soon became important and common in northern Italy, making their appearance in most communes around the year 1200, with an essential difference. These officials were now appointed by the citizens or by the citizens&#x27; representatives, rather like the older consuls (but not collegial). The exercised the supreme power in the city, both in peace and war, and in foreign and domestic matters alike; but their term of office lasted only about a year.

In order to avoid the intense strife so common in Italian civic life, it soon became the custom to hire a stranger to fill this position. Venetians were in special demand for this purpose during the 12th and 13th centuries. This was probably due to their lesser concern (at the time) than other Italians in the affairs of the mainland. Afterwards, in a few cases, the term of office was extended to cover a period of years, or even a lifetime. They were confined in a luxury palace to keep them from being influenced by any of the local families. The architectural arrangement of the at Siena, built starting in 1297, evokes the uneasy relation of the commune with the , who in Siena&#x27;s case was a disinterested nobleman at the head of the judiciary. It provided a self-contained lodging round its own interior court for the , separate but housed within the Palazzo Pubblico where the councillors and their committee of nine habitually met.

During the later part of the twelfth and the whole of the thirteenth century, most Italian cities were governed by a . Concerning Rome, with a history of civic violence, Gregorovius says that &quot;in 1205 the Pope Innocent III changed the form of the civic government; the executive power lying henceforward in the hand of a single senator or , who, directly or indirectly, was appointed by the pope&quot;. In Florence after 1180, the chief authority was transferred from the consuls to the , and Milan and other cities were also ruled by these officials. The Republic of Genoa elected its first in 1191, a Brescian citizen, to quell the internal unrest that ravaged the capital of the Republic. There were, moreover, in some of the cities of the adjoining Provence in southeastern France.

An anonymous writer composed a short guide for the would-be (although it would be unseemly to appear openly to run for the office), , of about 1222; in six simple and brief chapters it guides the novice through the requirements of the office, the salary, the address of welcome given by the retiring to the new one, the choice of counsellors, the handling of money accounts. The fifth chapter offers some model speeches on public occasions, such as the death of prominent citizens. A final chapter touches upon making war (in a paragraph), and the training of urban officials.

In the thirteenth century in Florence, in Orvieto (1251) and some other cities, a () was chosen to look after the interests of the lower classes (to this day, the heads of government of the little independent republic of San Marino are still called &quot;&quot;). In other ways the power of the was reduced—they were confined more and more to judicial functions until they disappeared early in the sixteenth century.

The officials sent by the Italian republics to administer the affairs of dependent cities were also sometimes called . Into the 20th century the cities of Trento and Trieste gave the name of to their chief magistrate.

===Fascist era===
The Fascist regime created its own version of the figure. In February 1926, Mussolini&#x27;s Senate issued a decree which abolished the autonomous powers and functions of (municipalities), including elected town councils and mayors. Instead, all , except for Rome, were to be headed by a , an authoritarian mayor with full executive and legislative powers. He was appointed by royal charter (in practice, by the National Fascist Party) for a renewable five-year term (which could be revoked at any time with immediate effect). In Rome, a governor was appointed to head the local government. In larger communes, the was assisted by one or two nominated by the Ministry of Interior, in addition to a board of advisors () nominated either by the local prefect or, in the major cities, by the Ministry of Interior.

The decree was in effect from 21 April 1927 until 1945, when the entire system was abandoned with the return to democracy.
Literally, this derived word means the office of a or its term, but can also designate a district administered by a within a larger state.

In the that the dogal Republic of Venice gradually established in the basin of the river Po, annexing various former principalities and self-governing cities, mostly in the fifteenth century, () were one of the intermediate levels of the hierarchical administrative organization, the highest (&quot;provincial&quot;) level being the (roughly a modern administrative region).

After the other dogal republic, Genoa, was in 1273 granted control of Pera and Galata, commercial suburbs of Constantinople, by the Byzantine emperor, it governed them jointly by a common until 1453, when all Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks.

==Outside the Italian city-states==
The example of Italy in the matter of was sometimes followed by cities and republics in Northern Europe in the Middle Ages, notably by such as had trade relations with Italy. The officers elected sometimes bore the title of or . Thus in East Frisia, there were identical in name and functions to those of the Italian republics; sometimes each province had one, and sometimes the federal diet elected a -general for the whole country, the term of office being for a limited period or for life.

===Frisian &quot;potestaat&quot;===
The concept of a local man empowered to represent the Holy Roman Emperor was also a feature of medieval Frisia. From apocryphal beginnings, important rights were granted or confirmed under the code of law known as the &quot;Lex Frisionum&quot;. According to later tradition, it was Charlemagne who granted the Frisians the title of freemen and permitted them to choose their own or imperial governor from among the chieftains, to organize and lead the defense of two of the three districts of Frisia, in Middle Frisia, from the Flie to the Lauwers and in East Frisia from the Lauwers to the Weser, later the Countship of Ostfriesland.

The Italians probably became aware of the Frisian Potestaat, in Dutch &quot;op poten staan&quot; in English &#x27;on legs standing&#x27;, like for instance king Henry on his painting (Dutch: ; German: ; English: ) during the Sixth Crusade in 1228. According to privileges that were falsely ascribed to the Carolingian era, the was chosen by council and he must be able to slay knights. Apocryphal historical writings mention the potestate as early as the Viking Age.

The only chosen to lead Friesland between the Vlie and Lauwers were Juw Juwinga (1396) and Juw Dekema (1494), both were chosen by the Schieringers. However, in 1399 the districts of Westergo and Oostergo elected potestates, Haring Harinxma and Sjoerd Wiarda respectively, in the struggle against the count of Holland. The title became well known outside of Friesland only with the installation of Albrecht of Saxony as in 1498; the Frisians chose Jancko Douwama as their imperial stadtholder (1522).

<text>Manuel John Johnson, FRS (23 May 1805 – 28 February 1859) was a British astronomer.

He was born in Macao, China, the son of John William Roberts of the East India Company and was educated at Mr Styles&#x27; Classical Academy in Thames Ditton and at the Addiscombe Military Seminary for service in the East India Company (the HEIC).

In 1823 he was sent by the HEIC to St Helena, where from 1826 he supervised the building of the Ladder Hill Observatory. He travelled twice to South Africa to consult with Fearon Fallows on the design of the observatory. In 1828 he was made Superintendent of the Observatory. In 1835 he published &quot;A Catalogue of 606 Principal Fixed Stars in the Southern Hemisphere... at St. Helena&quot;, for which he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society that same year. While comparing his results with those of Nicolas Louis de Lacaille he noted the high proper motion of Alpha Centauri and communicated these to Thomas Henderson at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope. This led to the first successful measurement of a stellar parallax, though not to the first publication thereof.

On his return to the UK in 1833 he went up to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduating MA in 1839. He then served as director of the Radcliffe Observatory from 1839 until his death in Oxford in 1859. He introduced there self-registering meteorological instruments to continuously record variations in atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and atmospheric electricity using the recent invention of photography. The initial instruments were invented and installed by Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory. The Radcliffe Observatory later became part of the network of observing stations established as part of the new Meteorological Office and coordinated from Kew. 
Johnson was president of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855–1857 and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1856.

In 1850 he had married Caroline, the daughter of Dr James Ogle.

<doc id="793435" wikidata="Q2135146" url="?curid=793435" title="Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring">
<text>Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is a technology developed to assess the integrity of individual signals collected and integrated by the receiver units employed in a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The integrity of received signals and resulting correctness and precision of derived receiver location are of special importance in safety-critical GNSS applications, such as in aviation or marine navigation.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) does not include any internal information about the integrity of its signals. It is possible for a GPS satellite to broadcast slightly incorrect information that will cause navigation information to be incorrect, but there is no way for the receiver to determine this using the standard techniques. RAIM uses redundant signals to produce several GPS position fixes and compare them, and a statistical function determines whether or not a fault can be associated with any of the signals. RAIM is considered available if 24 GPS satellites or more are operative. If the number of GPS satellites is 23 or fewer, RAIM availability must be checked using approved ground-based prediction software.

Several GPS-related systems also provide integrity signals separate from GPS. Among these is the WAAS system, which uses separate signals broadcast from different satellites to indicate these problems directly.

==General description==
RAIM detects faults through redundant GPS pseudorange measurement. That is, when more satellites are available than needed to produce a position fix, the extra pseudoranges should all be consistent with the computed position. A pseudorange that differs significantly from the expected value (i.e., an outlier) may indicate a fault of the associated satellite or another signal integrity problem (e.g., ionospheric dispersion). Traditional RAIM uses fault detection (FD) only, however newer GPS receivers incorporate fault detection and exclusion (FDE) which enables them to continue to operate in the presence of a GPS failure.

The test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy. The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the required probability of false alarm (Pfa).

===RAIM===
Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) provides integrity monitoring of GPS for aviation applications. In order for a GPS receiver to perform RAIM or fault detection (FD) function, a minimum of five visible satellites with satisfactory geometry must be visible to it. RAIM has various kinds of implementations; one of them performs consistency checks between all position solutions obtained with various subsets of the visible satellites. The receiver provides an alert to the pilot if the consistency checks fail.

RAIM availability is an important issue when using such kind of algorithm in safety-critical applications (such as the aeronautical ones); in fact, because of geometry and satellite service maintenance, RAIM is not always available at all, meaning that the receiver&#x27;s antenna could have sometimes fewer than five satellites in view.

Availability is also a performance indicator of the RAIM algorithm. Availability is a function of the geometry of the constellation which is in view and of other environmental conditions. If availability is seen in this way it is clear that it is not an on–off feature meaning that the algorithm could be available but not with the required performance of detecting a failure when it happens. So availability is a performance factor of the algorithm and characterizes each one of the different kinds of RAIM algorithms and methodologies.

===Fault detection and exclusion===
An enhanced version of RAIM employed in some receivers is known as fault detection and exclusion (FDE). At least one satellite, in addition to those required for navigation, must be in view for the receiver to perform the RAIM function; thus, RAIM needs a minimum of five satellites in view or four satellites and a barometric altimeter (baro-aiding, a method of augmenting the GPS integrity solution by using a non-satellite input source) to detect an integrity anomaly. For receivers capable of doing so, RAIM needs six satellites in view (or five satellites with baro-aiding) to isolate the corrupt satellite signal and remove it from the navigation solution.

Upon detection, proper fault exclusion determines and excludes the source of the failure (without necessarily identifying the individual source causing the problem), thereby allowing GNSS navigation to continue without interruption. The availability of RAIM and FDE will be slightly lower for mid-latitude operations and slightly higher for equatorial and high-latitude regions due to the nature of the orbits. The use of satellites from multiple GNSS constellations or the use of SBAS satellites as additional ranging sources can improve the availability of RAIM and FDE.

===RAIM prediction===
GNSS differs from traditional navigation systems because the satellites and areas of degraded coverage are in constant motion. Therefore, if a satellite fails or is taken out of service for maintenance, it is not immediately clear which areas of the airspace will be affected, if any. The location and duration of these outages can be predicted with the aid of computer analysis and reported to pilots during the pre-flight planning process. This prediction process is, however, not fully representative of all RAIM implementations in the different models of receivers. Prediction tools are usually conservative and thus predict lower availability than that actually encountered in flight to provide protection for the lowest end receiver models.

Because RAIM operates autonomously, that is without the assistance of external signals, it requires redundant pseudorange measurements. To obtain a 3D position solution, at least four measurements are required. To detect a fault, at least 5 measurements are required, and to isolate and exclude a fault, at least six measurements are required, however often more measurements are needed depending on the satellite geometry. Typically there are seven to 12 satellites in view.

The test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy. The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the requirements for the probability of false alarm (Pfa) and the expected measurement noise. In aviation systems, the Pfa is fixed at 1/15000.

The &quot;horizontal integrity limit (HIL)&quot; or &quot;horizontal protection level (HPL)&quot; is a figure which represents the radius of a circle which is centered on the GPS position solution and is guaranteed to contain the true position of the receiver to within the specifications of the RAIM scheme (i.e. which meets the Pfa and Pmd). The HPL is calculated as a function of the RAIM threshold and the satellite geometry at the time of the measurements. The HPL is compared with the &quot;horizontal alarm limit (HAL)&quot; to determine if RAIM is available.

==RAIM prediction websites==
To enable pilots to quickly determine whether en route or approach level RAIM will be available, the FAA and EUROCONTROL have created &quot;dispatch level&quot; websites that predict RAIM status to meet pre-flight check requirements.
*The FAA&#x27;s RAIM prediction website &quot;AC 90–100&quot; covers US territories in graphical map format (showing green for RAIM available and red for RAIM not available)
*EUROCONTROL provides international coverage for most waypoints in the worldwide aviation waypoint database and displays results in a &quot;timeline&quot; bar showing predictions of whether baro-aided or non-baro-aided RAIM will be available.
**EUROCONTROL puts a disclaimer on its data (stating that USCG data takes precedence), whereas the FAA certifies its website as meeting regulatory requirements.
**As of 1 July 2012 AUGUR coverage has been limited to ECAC airspace only.
*Since 2006, the N-RAIM Prediction Service, hosted by NAVBLUE, offers worldwide coverage for all PBN applications including RNP 10, RNAV 5, RNAV 2, RNAV 1, RNP 4, RNP 1, RNP Approach and RNP AR Approach down to 0.1NM. The online tool is an alternative to the automated service integrated directly into flight planning software. It is kept up-to-date in line with new editions of the ICAO PBN Manual and any worldwide specific regulation.
*The SPACEKEYS RAIM prediction and avoidance system developed and hosted by FLIGHTKEYS offers worldwide coverage for any type of RAIM prediction and covers all integrity levels from RNP10 (Enroute) to RNP Approach and RNP AR Approach (down to 0.1NM). The online tool allows RAIM predictions for locations and full trajectories (routes) as well as area based RAIM predictions. REST and SOAP APIs are also available for 3rd party system integrations.

<doc id="793436" wikidata="Q7825162" url="?curid=793436" title="Topsite">
<text>Topsite is a term used by the warez scene to refer to underground, highly secretive, high-speed FTP servers used by release groups and couriers for distribution, storage and archiving of warez releases.
Topsites have very high-bandwidth Internet connections, commonly supporting transfer speeds of hundreds to thousands of megabits per second (Mbps); enough to transfer a full Blu-ray in seconds (as of 2006). Topsites also have very high storage capacity; a total of many terabytes (TB = 1024 GB) was typical in 2006. It was common for home computers in these years to have access to broadband internet link with 1–1.5 Mbps (with backbone fibre links topping to 100 Mbps) and 80–120 GB of storage (with 200 GB disk entering the home market). Generally the characteristics of the link and (especially) storage can be at least two or three orders of magnitude above home appliances. Early on these warez sites were mainly distributing software such as games and applications after the release groups removed any protections. Now they are also a source of other copyright protected works such as movies and music. It is strictly prohibited for sites to charge for access to the content, due to decreased security, and sites found doing so are shunned by the topsite community.

==Overview==
===Security===
Unlike their predecessors in the Bulletin board system (BBS) scene, topsites aren&#x27;t advertised broadly. With the increased threat of police raids, topsites have been forced to employ elaborate security precautions in order to stay hidden from authorities.

A typical topsite configuration will only allow users to log in from a certain ident and host (or IP range for users with dynamic IPs), with SSL encapsulation on all FTP sessions. FTP bouncers are commonly used to hide the topsite&#x27;s real IP address, and to share network load.

Along with an &quot;official name&quot;, most topsites are also known in the warez scene by an abbreviation that is two or three letters long. Knowledge of the abbreviation as well as the official name is not shared, even between different scene members. For example, a topsite with the hypothetical name &quot;Blackbox&quot; could be abbreviated as &quot;BBX&quot; and subsequently referred to as &quot;B**&quot; during an IRC conversation between those with knowledge of the site.

===Site channels===
Activity on the FTP server is announced by a &quot;Sitebot&quot; in a private IRC channel which is usually invite-only. To receive an invite, users need to issue a command to the FTP server after logging in the site. This ensures that only those with accounts on the FTP have access to the channel. Sitebots typically run Eggdrop IRC bot software.

===Dupe (duplicate) check===
Release databases record release names and their release date &amp; time, although fields vary from database to database. Examples of other common fields include ID3 musical genre names (for MP3 releases), sections, and nuke (release rejection) details.

Release databases are maintained to provide release groups with a service for checking existing release titles (i.e., to avoid duping another group). Some databases contain historical release records dating back to the BBS era. Note that such databases are uncommon, due to a completely different release naming method (based on the ZIP file descriptor FILE_ID.DIZ, as opposed to a directory name), and lack of information from this period.

Release databases are usually updated by automatic processes that either recurse selected topsites searching for new releases (spidering), or catch pre-release announcements from site channels.

Release databases used by topsites are private, but a number of public websites exist with similar information.

===Credit system===
Credit system controls the amount of data that users can download. Most sites operate by using an automated credit system. When a user uploads a file, their account is credited for an amount based on the uploaded file size, commonly multiplied three times. For example, when a user uploads a 15MB file, they may receive 45MB credits in return. Credits can be later used to download files from the site. Credits can be lost by uploading a bad release that gets nuked. Nuke multiplier affects the amount of lost credits. Nukes can be either site nukes (local) or scene nukes (global). Site nukes are issued when a release that is uploaded to the topsite violates site rules, such as &#x27;No VLS&#x27; for the MP3 section. Another common site nuke is for backfilling, which is uploading something after a specific amount of time has elapsed from the time of release, usually 5 to 15 minutes. Typically the nuke multiplier for a site nuke is at least 3x, where all couriers responsible for racing the bad release will lose 3x the credits they gained uploading. These nukes will not be echoed out to pre channels, as they only affect the local site. Scene nukes are nukes which are echoed out to pre channels. Scene nukes usually occur when a release violates scene rules, such as wrong encoder, or when the release is outright bad, such as out of sync. The nuke multiplier for scene nuke on topsites is usually 1x; all the couriers lose all credits gained uploading the release and break even.

===Affiliates===
A warez group may gain access to a topsite as an affiliate (or &quot;affil&quot;), thus making the site among the group&#x27;s primary distribution points. Affiliation benefits the warez group as the site will grant a certain number of leech accounts to the group (the number usually depending on the reputation of the group), and the site benefits by becoming one of a collection of sites that has first access to the releases of the group, thus improving its own reputation. Typically, groups will affiliate with several topsites, in order to maximize efficient distribution by couriers to other (non-affiliated) topsites. A group will choose topsites based on geographical location, mostly by country but sometimes by region, such as Northern Europe or Western US. Barring extraordinary circumstances, a group selects just one site for each location.

Topsites may have any number of affiliates, and commonly advertise them in the welcome message to indicate to its users the quality of the site. The most exclusive topsites will avoid affiliating with an excessive number of groups for security purposes and also to maintain adequate network resources. Topsites may also remove (or &quot;drop&quot;) affiliates for a variety of reasons, including the lack of productivity of the release group, conflict between the site operator and the group, and the group&#x27;s decision to affiliate with another topsite in the same geographical region.

Each affiliate has access to a private, hidden directory on the topsite. This directory is used for uploading new releases before they are made available to other users. When a new release has finished uploading on each of the group&#x27;s sites, a command is executed to simultaneously copy it into a directory accessible by other users, and trigger an announcement in the topsite IRC channel. This event is known as a pre-release (or &quot;pre&quot;), and must occur at the same time on every affiliated site.

The warez scene relies on strict release standards, or rules, which are written and signed by various warez groups.

===Couriers===
Couriers are a specific class of topsite users who earn their access by uploading new releases and filling requests. When a courier gains access to a topsite, they are often required to pass a trial test such as uploading a certain amount in a short period of time.

Couriers compete (race) against each other for respect, credits, access to other topsites, and fun. Private couriers often operate as independent (iND) couriers. Some couriers band together to form courier groups which provide support and friendship through camaraderie.

==Staff roles==
===Site operator===
A site or system operator (siteop/sysop) is in charge of the day-to-day operation of a topsite. They have full (root) access to the server and are able to manage users, groups, and topsite scripts and daemons installed on server. They decide on site rules, and site sections (e.g. , XviD movies, MP3 music, etc.). Site operators are also in charge of managing the site channel, and sitebot.

===Group administrator===
A group administrator (&#x27;gadmin&#x27;) is a member of an affiliated group or courier group with user management rights over the group. Each group has a pre-negotiated number of leech and ratio users, or slots.

==Takedowns==
While these sites are protected with technologically advanced schemes, law enforcement operations such as Operation Buccaneer (December 2001) and Operation Fastlink (April 2004) have been able to gain access and shut down sites by infiltrating the copyright infringement groups that operate on them. The group DrinkOrDie was busted during Operation Buccaneer. Tens of thousands of copies of software, games, movies and music were on &quot;leech&quot; sites reserved for their members only, having the names Lake of Fire, Packet Storm, Fatal Error and High Octane. One eventually grew to 1 terabyte in size. , Operation Site Down was the latest significant law-enforcement attack on the warez scene. There were also busts in June 2006, with one US.biz site being busted, and several co-located servers being seized.

In November 2006, the Dutch anti-piracy organization BREIN claimed their first shutdown of a topsite, MadBiker (MB), after infiltrating the closed user community. The site allegedly had 5.6 terabytes of content and used the super fast Onsnet fiber network in Nuenen. In name of the international interest organizations MPAA, IFPI, RIAA, ESA and BSA, Brein explained the situation to the network administrator Edutel, who closed the site down at their request. Brein estimates there are dozens of similar sites in the Netherlands.

Two years later, on November 26, 2008, Brein got the ftp servers of the &#x27;topsite&#x27; TV Land (TVL) seized. The 3 gigabit drFTPd site without affils offered 45TB of content, making it one of the largest topsites ever. Brein director Tim Kuik claims it was one of the sites at the top of the piracy pyramid. The files would leak to the torrent site Scenetorrents.org and other large torrent portals. The servers were hosted at different providers of which some were located at Leaseweb. The owner, &#x27;Smokin1&#x27;, is located outside the Netherlands and no raids or arrests were made. Brein suggests there are hundreds of topsites worldwide, of which two thirds are located in the Netherlands. The administrator of the site would also sell download accounts with a limit of 400GB for 40 euro a month. This made Tweakers question whether Brein really infiltrated the site or they got the information for free. A week earlier a scene notice attacked the collaboration between TV Land and SceneTorrents. The NFO file showed &quot;smokin1 (admin of TV Land), I recommend you to close your insecure p2l/p2p site within 24 hours, or I will provide all Dutch anti-piracy organizations all information about the site, including complete releases list and sufficient proof to get the site busted, you have been warned!&quot;. Tim Kuik, the managing director of Brein, told Slyck.com that TV Land was penetrated before the release of the notice.

A year later, SceneTorrents (ScT) announced they were shutting down for good on November 29, 2009. The 20,000 members had to find a new site after 4.5 years on the respected and well-connected private BitTorrent tracker. An invite was hard to find. Rumours said the shutdown was related to the raid on topsite LOOP two days earlier, which was (supposedly) one of SceneTorrent&#x27;s main content providers according to insiders. Other rumors said it could be a planned operation unrelated to the topsite. Later a staff message on the site said it was due to pending legal issues. Members of their staff were arrested and they declined to comment any further on the situation because of the criminal proceedings. On November 27, Brein got the ranked topsite LOOP taken down. Two servers with a total storage capacity of 40TB spread over 28 hard disks were raided at their hoster in Amsterdam. The site was hard to access because you had to be invited by a staff member. Kuik says there are only a couple of hundred similar sites worldwide.

On December 16, 2008, less than a month after TV Land, Brein took down yet another topsite. Sparta had 65TB of content, so Brein could claim again to have taken down the largest topsite ever.

Hong Kong Customs uncovered a case when &quot;copyright industry representatives&quot; tipped them off in June 2009, resulting in the first case in Asia. Apparently, an international syndicate for unauthorized distribution used a topsite to download and then distribute copyright-infringing items such as movies, music, computer programs and video game software.

In September 2010, after being in the planning for two years, the police executed a file sharing raid in up to 14 countries across Europe. Started by the Belgian authorities, it is suspected that a scene group in Belgium had been infiltrated. Some of the ranked sites affected by the busts are BAR, LOST, DLR and SC.

In December 2010, a site known as &quot;Devil&quot; was raided by the Swedish police after receiving information from an anti-piracy group. At least a dozen computers and servers were seized, containing more than 200 terabytes of media.

In January 2011, the Dutch anti-piracy organization BREIN claimed to have taken down their largest topsite ever: &quot;Swan&quot; (previously known as ATS). According to BREIN it contained 220 TB of data spread over 12 servers, but the operator of Swan, MrTB in Costa Rica, said it were only 8 servers with 175 TB of data. The site was taken down by hosting provider WorldStream and without judicial process BREIN seized its servers. The owners of the servers retaliated by seizing them back and may sue BREIN for breach of privacy and property rights as BREIN is a private organization and has no special legal or investigative authority.

Not all takedowns are successful. Operation Bahnhof (March 2005) failed when the officials entered an area that their warrant didn&#x27;t include. Although they found several dedicated servers with terabytes of illegal material, they ended up being sued for illegal trespassing and harassment, and were accused of planting evidence, since one of the Antipiratbyrån (Swedish anti-piracy group) employees was trying to infiltrate the scene to gather evidence, and in doing so violated Swedish laws against entrapment.

<doc id="793448" wikidata="Q7622038" url="?curid=793448" title="Strathclyde Business School">
<text>The Strathclyde Business School (SBS) is one of four faculties forming the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Founded in 1973, but tracing its history back to the establishment of the Royal College of Science and Technology&#x27;s Department of Industrial Administration in 1947, the school is located on Cathedral Street within the John Anderson campus of the university. It offers courses for business education and management development.

Strathclyde Business School has around 200 academic staff and more than 4500 students (1960 undergraduate and 2615 postgraduate). The faculty contains seven departments and six specialist centres. The school has international centres in Bahrain ,Greece, Malaysia, Oman, and UAE.

==History==

Management education started at Glasgow&#x27;s Royal College of Science and Technology in 1947 with the establishment of the Department of Industrial Administration. The Glasgow School of Management was established in 1950 as a joint venture between this department and the Glasgow and West of Scotland Commercial College (which became the Scottish College of Commerce in 1955). 

In 1964, the College of Commerce and the Royal College merged to form the University of Strathclyde. There had been hope that the government would establish a business school at the new university but, following the Franks Report in 1963, government resources were concentrated on funding business schools in Manchester and London instead. From 1964, the university also had a School of Business and Administration. Despite the lack of a business school, Strathclyde was a flourishing centre of business education with 370 undergraduates, 86 postgraduates, over 400 part-time diploma students, and short post-experience courses being given to over 500 people a year at the Chesters residential centre. It established an MBA course in 1966 within the Department of Industrial Administration.

In 1970, the government was persuaded to fund a business school in Scotland but rather than being established at a single university the Scottish Business School was established as a partnership between the universities of Strathclyde, Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1971; it would eventually take in Stirling and Heriot-Watt before being transformed into the Confederation of Scottish Business Schools in 1987 and then the Association for Management Education and Training in Scotland in 1989. Also in 1971, Strathclyde&#x27;s Department of Industrial Administration became part of the Department of Administration, and in 1973 the Strathclyde Business School was established. Business education continued to be split across multiple departments, with the business school offering post-experience postgraduate courses, the School of Business and Administration offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and other postgraduate management courses being offered by the Department of Production Management and Manufactory Technology. In 1982, a reorganisation of the university saw the School of Business and Administration closed and the business school elevated to a faculty containing multiple departments.

<text>XBL (&quot;XML Binding Language&quot;) is an XML-based markup language for altering the behavior of XUL widgets. It was devised at Netscape in the late 1990s as an extension of XUL.

The primary use of XBL was in the Firefox web browser, but Mozilla deprecated it in 2017 and completely removed it from Firefox in 2019. However, the UXP fork of Firefox intends to continue supporting XBL indefinitely.

Mozilla attempted to standardize XBL 2.0 via W3C in 2007, but due to lack of interest from other web browser vendors, abandoned it in 2012.

The Shadow DOM specification acknowledges XBL as a strong influence.

== Overview ==
XUL defines the user interface layout of an application. CSS rules can be used to change the appearance of various XUL elements. But XBL is needed to alter the behavior of a XUL widget, such as a scroll bar.

An XBL file contains bindings, each of which describes the behavior of a XUL widget. The root element of an XBL file is the codice_1 element, which contains one or more codice_2 elements. Each codice_2 element declares one binding, which can be attached to any XUL element. It may also possess an codice_4 attribute. A binding is assigned to an element by setting the CSS property codice_5 to the URL of the binding&#x27;s file. For example:

scrollbar {
 -moz-binding: url(&#x27;somefile.xml#binding1&#x27;);

<doc id="793487" wikidata="Q62082086" url="?curid=793487" title="List of Marilyns in the British Isles">
<text>This is a list of Marilyn hills and mountains in the United Kingdom, Ireland and surrounding islands and sea stacks. Marilyns are defined as peaks with a prominence of or more, regardless of height or any other merit (e.g. topographic isolation, as used in Munros). Thus, Marilyns can be mountains, with a height above , or relatively small hills. there were 2,010 recorded Marilyns.

==Definition==

The Marilyn classification was created by Alan Dawson in his 1992 book &quot;The Relative Hills of Britain&quot;. The name Marilyn was coined by Dawson as a punning contrast to the &quot;Munro&quot; classification of Scottish mountains above , but which has no explicit prominence threshold, being homophonous with (Marilyn) &quot;Monroe&quot;. The list of Marilyns was extended to Ireland by Clem Clements.

Marilyn was the first of several subsequent British Isles classifications that rely solely on prominence, including the P600s, the HuMPs, and the TuMPs. Topographic prominence is more difficult to estimate than topographic elevation, requiring surveys of each contour line around a peak, and therefore lists using prominence are subject to revision.

Although many of the islands&#x27; largest mountains, including Ben Nevis, Carrauntoohil, Scafell Pike and Snowdon, are Marilyns, many other large peaks such as Cairn Gorm, a number of Munros, and well-known hills such as Bowfell, the Langdale Pikes and Carnedd Dafydd, are not Marilyns because they do not have sufficient height relative to the surrounding terrain (i.e. they have taller &quot;parents&quot;). Not all Marilyns are even hills in the usual sense: Crowborough () sits in a town, whilst Bishop Wilton Wold highest point of the Yorkshire Wolds () lies alongside the A166 road. At the other extreme are Stac Lee () and Stac an Armin (), the two highest sea stacks in the British Isles, in the St Kilda archipelago, west of the Scottish mainland.

, there were 2,010 Marilyns in the British Isles, with 1,218 Marilyns in Scotland, including 202 of the 282 Scottish Munros; Munros with a Marilyn–prominence are sometimes called &quot;Real Munros&quot;. There were a further 454 Marilyns in Ireland, 174 in England, 159 in Wales, and 5 in the Isle of Man. On 13 October 2014 Rob Woodall and Eddie Dealtry became the first people to climb all 1,557 Marilyns in Great Britain. , 11 &quot;Marilynists&quot; had climbed &quot;all hills [of Great Britain] that were classed as Marilyns at the time they recorded finishing the list&quot; while, , 275 had entered the &quot;Marilyn Hall of Fame&quot; by climbing over 600 Marilyns.

==Coverage==
, the list of 2,010 British Isles Marilyns contained:

==By height and prominence==
This list was downloaded from the &quot;Database of British and Irish Hills&quot; (&quot;DoBIH&quot;) in October 2018, and are peaks the DoBIH marks as Marilyns (&quot;M&quot;). As topological prominence is complex to measure, these tables are subject to revision over time, and should not be amended or updated unless the entire DoBIH data is re-downloaded. The tables are structured to show rankings by height and prominence over the entire British Isles, or by region.

===Updates===
Since the table was downloaded, the following changes have been made to the list of recognised Marilyns: 
*Added: Rhinog Fach, Wales, August 2021 (, prominence )
*Removed: Cheriton Hill, Kent (, prominence )
*Removed: Giur-bheinn, Islay (, prominence )

<text>Álvaro Barreirinhas Cunhal (; 10 November 1913 – 13 June 2005) was a Portuguese communist revolutionary and politician. He was one of the major opponents of the dictatorial regime of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. He served as secretary-general of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) from 1961 to 1992. He is described as one of the biggest political and intellectual figures of Portugal in the 20th century. 

==Early life==
Cunhal was born in Coimbra on November 10th 1913, the son of Avelino Henriques da Costa Cunhal (Seia, 28 October 1887 – Coimbra, Sé Nova, 19 December 1966) and Mercedes Simões Ferreira Barreirinhas (m. Coimbra, Sé Nova, 22 August 1908) (Coimbra, Sé Nova, 5 May 1888 – Lisbon, 12 September 1971). He was the third of four siblings: António José (Coimbra, 1909–1933), Maria Mansueta (1912–1921) and Maria Eugénia (1927–2015). The family moved to Seia when Cunhal was three years old. There, he didn&#x27;t attend primary school, given the teacher&#x27;s violence, and would start studying in his home with his father, who was a lawyer and writer, and since 1918 held the position of municipal administrator.&quot;In Seia I went to the first day of school and it was a spectacle of savagery, giving out slaps and hitting the kids with rulers. In that school that&#x27;s how the education was. And I left school and went home, I told my father what I saw and so I didn&#x27;t go back to school.&quot;Cunhal was baptized on 5 May 1919 in Seia&#x27;s mother church; his godfather was his brother António José, then 10, and the godmother was the Immaculate Conception.

When he was a child, he accompanied his mother to church every Sunday, she had a religious way of thinking and living. His father, that had a liberal mindset, was in the origin of Cunhal&#x27;s &quot;irreverent and creative personality&quot;. His father derogatorily denounced the feudal titles, something that reflected in his tales, and, in another work of his, he denounced the friendship between a priest and an old nobleman when it came to addiction of games of chance and drinking. Eugénia Cunhal, despite the omnipresent rejection of this world in Cunhal&#x27;s political life, talked about the &quot;opening of her father&#x27;s spirit&quot; when he &quot;showed his children the Old Testament and appealed that each one formed its own conscience&quot;. His father&#x27;s republicanism cemented in Cunhal&#x27;s personality a feeling of &quot;social solidarity&quot; and &quot;political insubmission&quot;. Both Álvaro and Maria Eugénia would later denounce religion.

His sister Maria Mansueta died 13 January 1921, at nine years old, of tuberculosis, and a year later Avelino Cunhal became the governor of the district of Guarda. In 1924, the family moved to Lisbon, initially to &quot;Pinheiro Chagas&quot; Street, where Maria Eugénia was born in 1927. Later they would move to a bigger house in Benfica, in &quot;Grão Vasco&quot; Avenue, when António was already gravely ill. The need for more space due to the contagiousness of tuberculosis would have been a catalyst for the move. António José would die at 24, in 1932, of tuberculosis and lung grangrene. After his brother&#x27;s death, the family moved again to the centre of Lisbon, first to the &quot;5 de Outubro&quot; Avenue, and then to the &quot;Miguel Bombarda&quot; Avenue, place where Avelino and Eugénia would years later be arrested by PIDE.

After moving to Lisbon in 1924, he took the &quot;Pedro Nunes&quot; Lyceum admission exam. In 1929, the transferred to the Camões Secondary School. He played football as a right winger; he also played chess, checkers, and card games, and practiced track and field, while also taking part in the publishing of children&#x27;s books. What he earned from track and field would become useful when he entered clandestinity, as he had to travel thousand of kilometers on a bicycle to talk with members of the Party.

He ended secondary school with an average score of 13, and studied law at the University of Lisbon in 1931, right after his 18th birthday. Here he had his first contact with Marxism, and a gradual contact with the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) through books and newspapers. In the PCP, he had as his main political reference and mentor Bento Gonçalves.

== Political career ==
He visited the Soviet Union for the first time in 1935 to attend the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow. He joined the Central Committee of the party in 1936. His first arrest occurred in 1937, at the age of 23.

While in prison, Cunhal submitted his final thesis on the topic of abortion and obtained his law degree (the jury included future Prime Minister Marcello Caetano, who would later replace Salazar). In his thesis, Cunhal supports the legalization of abortion in Portugal, while he also scrutinised the case of abortion in the Soviet Union, who had been made legal during Vladimir Lenin rule but outlawed once again by Stalin, in 1936 (which Cunhal supported, claiming abortion was not practised anymore in the Soviet Union), highlighting the dangers and societal costs of illegal abortions in his country and exploring the reasons that led women to decide to end their pregnancy. He then taught for some months at the Colégio Moderno, in Lisbon. Among his pupils was the future President of Portugal, Mário Soares, who would become one of his great political rivals after the revolution of 1974.
From 1941 to 1949, Cunhal lived &quot;underground&quot; and became the &quot;de facto&quot; party leader. Arrested by the PIDE in 1949, he remained in prison for 11 years until a spectacular escape from the seaside Peniche Fortress prison in 1960. The government of António Salazar claimed that a Soviet submarine was near the Peniche coast waiting for Cunhal. In 1961, Cunhal was elected as the party&#x27;s secretary-general, following the death of Bento Gonçalves in the political prisoners colony of Tarrafal in Cape Verde. Cunhal lived in exile in Moscow, where his daughter Ana Cunhal was born on December 25, 1960, and Paris until the Carnation Revolution of April 1974.

Back in Portugal, Cunhal took charge of the newly-legalized Portuguese Communist Party and led the party through the political upheavals which followed the revolution. He was minister without portfolio in several of the provisional governments which followed the revolution of 1974. A faction of army officers seen as aligned with the party dominated the post-revolutionary provisional governments, with the pro-communist prime minister Vasco Gonçalves leading four provisional governments, which brought accusations that the party was attempting to take power via the military. Cunhal was largely responsible for the party&#x27;s hardline attitude, particularly its hostility towards the Socialist Party led by Soares, which prevented the formation of a united left.

Cunhal left his office in 1992. He was succeeded by Carlos Carvalhas, but his voice remained important in the following years, and he consistently sided with the party&#x27;s most orthodox wing. He also revealed that under the pseudonym Manuel Tiago he had been the author of several neo-realistic novels. His drawings, made while in prison, were published, revealing his sensibility for the arts, as was also shown by his translation of &quot;King Lear&quot; by Shakespeare (edited in his last years, and originally written under the female pseudonym Maria Manuela Serpa).

Álvaro Cunhal died in Lisbon in 2005, after several years out of the public eye. His funeral took place on 15 June in Lisbon and was attended by more than 250,000 people.

His only remaining sister Maria Eugénia Cunhal (Lisbon, 17 January 1927 – 10 December 2015) had also been a lifelong party militant. She married in Lisbon on 21 May 1949 the medical doctor Fernando Manuel da Rocha de Medina (Lisbon, 15 March 1924 – Lisbon, 9 September 1965), half-cousin of Ambassador Rui Eduardo Barbosa de Medina, and left four children.

<text>The Social Democratic Party (, SDE) is a centre-left political party in Estonia. It is currently led by Lauri Läänemets.
The party was formerly known as the Moderate People&#x27;s Party (). The SDE has been a member of the Party of European Socialists since 16 May 2003 and was a member of the Socialist International from November 1990 to 2017. It is orientated towards the principles of social-democracy, and it supports Estonia&#x27;s membership in the European Union. From April 2023, the party has been a junior coalition partner in the third Kallas government.

== History ==
During the perestroika era, the Estonian Social Democratic Party (&quot;Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Partei&quot;, ESDP) was formed as Estonia&#x27;s social-democratic movements merged in 1990. The movements were: the Estonian Democratic Labour Party, the Estonian Social Democratic Independence Party, the Russian Social Democratic Party of Estonia and the Estonian Socialist Party&#x27;s Foreign Association (successor of Estonian Socialist Workers Party in exile). The ESDP&#x27;s first leader was Marju Lauristin. They restored their contacts with the Socialist International in 1990. ESDP formed an electoral alliance with the agrarian Estonian Rural Centre Party (formed in 1990) for 1992 and 1995 elections. In 1996, after electoral defeat these two parties finally merged and named themselves the Moderates (&quot;Mõõdukad&quot;). The Moderates were accepted as a full member of the Socialist International at its 20th congress in September 1999.

In 1999, the &quot;Moderates&quot; and the centre-right People&#x27;s Party, set up in May 1998 after a fusion of Peasants&#x27; Party and People&#x27;s Party of Republicans and Conservatives (a 1994 splinter group from the Fatherland Alliance), formed the Moderate People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Rahvaerakond Mõõdukad&quot;). The seemingly unlikely decision to fuse took place on 29 May 1999, with some foreign commentators drawing parallels with &#x27;right-wing socialists&#x27;. In November the same year, the unification was formally approved by party&#x27;s general assembly.

The Moderates&#x27; contacts with People&#x27;s Party predecessors had started in 1998. The two parties had a joint list in 1999 parliamentary election and formed a governing coalition with Pro Patria Union and Reform Party. In 2003, the Moderate People&#x27;s Party joined the Party of European Socialists. After disappointing election results in 2003, the party renamed itself the Social Democratic Party (SDE) on 7 February 2004.

It was the most successful party in the 2004 European Parliamentary Election, obtaining 36.8% of the national vote (most of which went to their leading candidate Toomas Hendrik Ilves) and returning three MEPs.

The SDE is committed to the social market economy model, in addition to conventional social-democratic values including equality, social justice, solidarity, and the welfare state. On 10 May 2005, former social-liberals Peeter Kreitzberg and Sven Mikser joined them. On 28 November former social-liberal Mark Soosaar re-joined the SDE. The party was in opposition from 2002 on, but they participated talks for a common alternative presidential candidate to Arnold Rüütel, SDE&#x27;s Toomas Hendrik Ilves was elected on 23 September 2006 as the next president of Estonia (apart from the Social Democrats, he was supported by the Reform Party of Estonia, Pro Patria Union and Res Publica deputies).

After last elections to the local government councils on 16 October 2005, the party in most major cities is in opposition, but are a part of the governing coalition in Rakvere and Tapa. The party improved its position in most areas. In Tallinn, it formed a joint list with the agrarian People&#x27;s Union, which got six seats out of 63 seats with 11.1% share of votes. Comparing to 2003. elections to the local government council in Tallinn SDE and People&#x27;s Union gained seats. In the 2003 election, SDE got a 4.9% share of votes and People&#x27;s Union 3.4% share of votes, which were both below a 5% election threshold. In Estonia, SDE local lists won 6.43% share of votes. In 2003, they got only 4.39% share of votes nationally. SDE is today represented on 65 local councils out of 206 and is governing in 20 local councils. After the 2003 election, the party was represented in 104 local councils out of 247.

SDE&#x27;s aim in the 2007 Estonian parliamentary election was to win at least 17 seats out of 101. Independent member of current Riigikogu Liina Tõnisson ran as a candidate in their list. All SDE&#x27;s MEPs and their current MPs were candidates in the 2007 election. The party got 58,354 votes (10.6% of the total), a gain of +3.6%; it won 10 seats in the new Riigikogu, a gain of four.

In April 2007, the Social Democrats joined the coalition government led by the Estonian Reform Party.

In the 2011 parliamentary election on 6 March 2011, the SDE received 17.1% of the vote and 19 seats.

The small Russian Party in Estonia merged into the SDE in 2012.

Following the resignation of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, a new cabinet was sworn in on 26 March 2014, with Taavi Rõivas of the Reform Party serving as Prime Minister in coalition with the SDE.

In the 2014 European elections held on 25 May 2014, the SDE won 13.6% of the national vote, electing a single Member of the European Parliament.

In the 2015 parliamentary election on 1 March 2015, the SDE received 15.2% of the vote and 15 seats in the Riigikogu. After the coalition formation with the Reform Party and Pro Patria and Res Publica Union (IRL), MP Jevgeni Ossinovski announced that he would challenge Sven Mikser in the party congress on 30 May 2015. Mikser however stepped down before the election at the congress and Ossinovski was chosen as the new party leader. On 7 November 2016, the Social Democratic Party and IRL announced that they were asking Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas to resign and were planning on negotiating a new majority government. In the following vote of confidence on 9 November, the majority of Riigikogu voted in favour of removing the prime minister&#x27;s government.

On 23 November 2016, a coalition government led by Estonian Centre Party (EK) leader Jüri Ratas consisting of EK, SDE and IRL was sworn in. This cabinet governed until 29 April 2019, when it was brought does by a vote of no confidence when the SDE and IRL sided with the opposition parties.

In the 2019 parliamentary election held on 3 March 2019, the SDE received 9.8% of the vote and 10 seats. In the 2019 European elections on 26 May 2019, the party won 23.3% of the national vote and two seats in the European Parliament.

The SDE returned to government on 18 July 2022 as a junior member of second Kallas government, led by Reform Party leader Kaja Kallas, and also including the Isamaa party.

In the 2023 parliamentary election, the SDE received 9.3% of the vote and nine seats. Following the election on 7 March, Prime Minister Kallas invited the SDE and Estonia 200 for preliminary talks aimed at forming a new coalition government. A coalition agreement between the three parties was reached by 7 April, giving SDE three ministerial positions, and was officially signed on 10 April. On 17 April, the third Kallas government was sworn into office.

One year on from the 2023 Estonian parliamentary election, the Social Democrats remained the only party in the government coalition to avoid losing support in polling. This was attributed to the party members&#x27; public statements, especially those of the leader of the party Lauri Läänemets, setting the Social Democrats apart from the two economically liberal parties in the coalition. Moreover, the party gained MPs and members from the defections out of the Centre Party, including seeing its number of MPs increase from nine to 13.

<doc id="793511" wikidata="Q83081" url="?curid=793511" title="Diyarbakır Province">
<text>Diyarbakır Province (; ; ) is a province and metropolitan municipality in southeastern Turkey. Its area is 15,101 km2, and its population is 1,804,880 (2022). The provincial capital is the city of Diyarbakır. The Kurdish majority province is part of Turkish Kurdistan.

== History ==
It has been home to many civilisations and the surrounding area including itself is home to many Mesolithic era stone carvings and artifacts. The province has been ruled by the Akkadians, Hurrians, Mittani, Medes, Hittites, Armenians, Arameans, Neo-Babylonians, Achaemenids, Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Byzantium, Sassanids, Arabs, Seljuk Empire, Mongol Empire, Safavid dynasty, Marwanids, and Ayyubids.

=== Administrative history ===

In June 1927, the Law 1164 was passed allowing the creation of Inspectorates-General (Turkish: &quot;Umumi Müffetişlik&quot;). 

The Diyarbakır province was therefore included in the First Inspectorate General (), which was created on the 1 January 1928 and also included Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Sanlıurfa, and Elaziğ. 

The Inspectorate-General was governed by an Inspector General, who governed with a wide-ranging authority over civilian, juridical and military matters. The office of the Inspector General was dissolved in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party. 

During the 1930s, several place-names in the province were renamed into names which denoted a Turkish origin as part of the nationalist Turkification policy of the Kemalist government. Travel to Diyarbakır province was banned for foreign citizens until 1965. 

==== Modern history ====

In the 1975 Lice earthquake a 6.7 struck the town of Lice. The town was re-established about south of its original location.

From 1987 to 2002, Diyarbakır Province was part of the OHAL (state of emergency) region which was declared to counter the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) and governed by a so-called Supergovernor who got invested with additional powers than a normal Governor. In 1987 he was given the power to relocate and resettle whole villages, settlements and hamlets. In December 1990 with the Decree No. 430, the supergovernor and the provincial governors in the OHAL region received immunity against any legal prosecution in connections with actions they made due to the powers they received with the Decree No. 430.

=== Archaeology ===
Archaeologists headed by the vice-rector of Dicle University, professor Ahmet Tanyıldız, have claimed to discover the graves of the Seljuk Sultan of Rum Kilij Arslan I, who defeated the Crusaders. They also revealed his daughter Saide Hatun&#x27;s burial in Silvan. Researchers dug 2 meters deep across a 35-square-meter area and focused their works on two gravesites in Orta Çeşme Park.

==Districts==

Diyarbakır province is divided into 17 districts:

<text>Westbury is a town in the central north of Tasmania, Australia. It lies 30 km west of Launceston on the Bass Highway, and at the had a population of 2,272. It is part of, and the headquarters of, the Meander Valley Council area.

The town of Westbury uses its location, within 2 hours drive of most tourist attractions in north and north west Tasmania, and its heritage buildings and scenery to promote the concept of Westbury as a unique place for tourists to stay in Northern Tasmania.

Westbury has a range of accommodation providers from high quality bed and breakfast style, colonial inn style and country hotel style.

The St Patrick&#x27;s Festival is a major annual cultural activity that celebrates the historical links with Westbury and its early Irish community. The Festival celebrates via song and dance as well as a street parade and other family activities

On 30 September 2019 Westbury was named as the preferred location for the new Northern Tasmanian prison. The original site for the prison has since been abandoned and a new site further from Westbury is under investigation.

==History==
The site was first surveyed in 1823. The town was laid out in 1828 by the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company. In the 1830s Westbury developed as a garrison village. A detachment of troops commanded by Lieutenant Ball were stationed in Westbury in 1832. They were barracked around a village green in the centre of the town. The village green is still in use today and is claimed by the local community to be the only traditional English style village green in Australia. Westbury Post Office opened on 21 June 1832.

From early in the 19th century the village green has been the site for the Westbury St Patrick’s Festival celebrating the town’s Celtic links. Though Westbury is often described as a very &quot;English village&quot;, the first European settlers were predominantly Irish; ex Irish convicts, retired soldiers and free settlers, many fleeing the Great Irish Famine in the 1840s. Gaelic was the local language in Westbury for many generations and a strong Irish brogue is reputed to have lasted throughout the 19th century.

Military pensioners were each granted a block of land complete with a well and pear tree. By the mid-1800s Westbury had become the largest military community in Tasmania. The town had a population of some 3,000 and an extensive grid street plan was surveyed preparing Westbury to become the predominant town in the north of Tasmania and the gateway to the north-west, but Deloraine has filled that role instead. Westbury remains a small town servicing the local agriculture industry.

The Westbury Primary School services the local community; students finishing primary school travel to Launceston or Deloraine to attend secondary education.

Westbury is named after Westbury, Wiltshire in England.

<text>William Allen Miller FRS (17 December 1817 – 30 September 1870) was a British scientist.

==Life==
Miller was born in Ipswich, Suffolk and educated at Ackworth School and King&#x27;s College London. He was related to William Allen and first cousin to the leading suffragist Anne Knight.

On the death of John Frederic Daniell he succeeded to the Chair of Chemistry at King&#x27;s. Although primarily a chemist, the scientific contributions for which Miller is mainly remembered today are in spectroscopy and astrochemistry, new fields in his time.

Miller wrote the textbook &quot;Elements of Chemistry, Theoretical and Practical, Part I Chemical Physics&quot; in 1855. In the preface he acknowledged the assistance of Charles Tomlinson.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867 jointly with William Huggins, for their spectroscopic study of the composition of stars. 
In 1845, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1870 Miller had completed the manuscript for &quot;Introduction to the Study of Inorganic Chemistry&quot; when he fell ill. He passed it to Charles Tomlinson to prepare it for publication.

According to his obituary, Miller married Eliza Forrest of Birmingham in 1842. He died in 1870, a year after his wife, and they are both buried at West Norwood Cemetery. They were survived by a son and two daughters.

The crater Miller on the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="793548" wikidata="Q7302924" url="?curid=793548" title="Recording format">
<text>A recording format is a format for encoding data for storage on a storage medium. The format can be container information such as sectors on a disk, or user/audience information (content) such as analog stereo audio. Multiple levels of encoding may be achieved in one format. For example, a text encoded page may contain HTML and XML encoding, combined in a plain text file format, using either EBCDIC or ASCII character encoding, on a UDF digitally formatted disk. 

In electronic media, the primary format is the encoding that requires hardware to interpret (decode) data; while secondary encoding is interpreted by secondary signal processing methods, usually computer software. 

==Recording container formats==
A container format is a system for dividing physical storage space or virtual space for data. Data space can be divided evenly by a system of measurement, or divided unevenly with meta data. A grid may divide physical or virtual space with physical or virtual (dividers) borders, evenly or unevenly. Just as a physical container (such as a file cabinet) is divided by physical borders (such as drawers and file folders), data space is divided by virtual borders. Meta data such as a unit of measurement, address, or meta tags act as virtual borders in a container format. A template may be considered an abstract format for containing a solution as well as the content itself.

**Metric system
** Geographic coordinate system
**Page grid

==Raw content formats==
A raw content format is a system of converting data to displayable information. Raw content formats may either be recorded in secondary signal processing methods such as a software container format (e.g. digital audio, digital video) or recorded in the primary format. A primary raw content format may be directly observable (e.g. image, sound, motion, smell, sensation) or physical data which only requires hardware to display it, such as a phonographic needle and diaphragm or a projector lamp and magnifying glass.</text><links>
