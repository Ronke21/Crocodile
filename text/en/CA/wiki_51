<text>Gajah Mada (c. 1290 – c. 1364), also known as Jirnnodhara, was a powerful military leader and &quot;mahapatih&quot; of the Javanese empire of Majapahit during the 14th century. He is credited in Old Javanese manuscripts, poems, and inscriptions with bringing the empire to its peak of glory.

He delivered an oath called &quot;Sumpah Palapa&quot;, in which he vowed not to rest until he had conquered all of the Southeast Asian archipelago of Nusantara for Majapahit. During his reign, the Hindu epics, including the &quot;Rāmāyana&quot; and the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, became ingrained in the Javanese culture and worldview through the performing arts of &quot;wayang kulit&quot; (“leather puppets”). He is considered an important national hero in modern Indonesia, as well as a symbol of patriotism and national unity. Historical accounts of his life, political career, and administration are taken from several sources, mainly the &quot;Pararaton&quot; (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;), the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; (a Javanese-language eulogy), and an inscription dating from the mid-14th century.

== Depiction ==

Much of the modern popular depiction of Gajah Mada derives from the imagination of Mohammad Yamin in his 1945 book &quot;Gajah Mada: Pahlawan Persatuan Nusantara&quot;. One day in the 1940s, Yamin visited Trowulan, the site of the capital city of the former Majapahit kingdom. He found fragments of terracotta, one of which was a piggy bank in the form of the face of a man with a stocky face and curly hair. Based on the look on the piggy bank&#x27;s face, Yamin interpreted this as the face of Gajah Mada, the unifier of the archipelago. Yamin then asked the artist Henk Ngantung to make a painting based on the terracotta fragment. The painting was displayed as the cover of Yamin&#x27;s book. Many people disagree with Yamin&#x27;s opinion because it is impossible for the face of a figure as big as Gajah Mada to be displayed in a piggy bank. Such a portrayal is considered an insult because usually the state leaders during the Hindu-Buddhist era, including Majapahit, were made in effigy as statues. Some even believe that the face was none other than Yamin&#x27;s own face.

Another illustration of the historical Gajah Mada, different from Yamin&#x27;s, is the result of research at the University of Indonesia by archaeologist Agus Aris Munandar. He interpreted that Gajah Mada was depicted as Bima in &quot;wayang&quot; shadow-puppet shows, with a transverse mustache. In popular depiction, Gajah Mada is mostly shown bare-chested, wearing a sarong, and using a weapon in the form of a kris. While this may have been true on civilian duties, his official outfit might have been different: a Sundanese &quot;patih&quot; explained in the kidung Sundayana that Gajah Mada wore a gold-embossed &quot;karambalangan&quot; (breastplate) and was armed with a gold-layered spear and a shield full of diamond decoration.

According to Munandar, at first Gajah Mada was depicted as a Brajanata character from the Panji tales, and as Bima from the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; in later eras. The Panji story was known earlier than the activities of making Bima statues, which apparently began in the mid-15th century, so the former was likely Gajah Mada&#x27;s original depiction. The glorification of Gajah Mada in the first stage is profane—in the form of its depiction as Brajanata, but then the glorification of Gajah Mada occurs in the second stage which is more sacred, which is equated with Bima as an aspect of Siva. In the statue found at the National Museum of Indonesia (No. 5136/310d), the statue is depicted with a sturdy body, transverse mustache, and wavy curls, at the top of the head there is a hair tie with a ribbon forming like a &quot;tekes&quot; hat. He wears clothes and jewelry, bracelets, and an upper armband in the form of a snake-like Bima&#x27;s.

The traditional Bima statue depiction associated with Gajah Mada was made at the end of Majapahit in the mid-15th century. The characteristics are: a) wearing a &quot;supit urang&quot; crown (his hair is shaped in two arches at the top of the head like a shrimp tongs), b) a transverse mustache, c) strong body, d) wearing &quot;poleng&quot; (black and white) cloth, and e) the phallus is always depicted standing out. In the Bima statue stored in the National Museum (No. 2776/286b), he is depicted standing upright with both hands beside his body, his right hand holding a &quot;gadha&quot; (a kind of mace); his phallus is depicted as protruding with a shawl hanging between his legs; he is wearing a serpent &quot;upavita&quot;, a crown of &quot;supit&quot; &quot;urang&quot;, a grim face, and a thick transverse mustache; and the hair above the forehead is described as curly, forming a &quot;jamang&quot; (forehead decoration). The similarity between the statue of Brajanata as the embodiment of Gajah Mada and the statue of Bima is not a coincidence, but there is an underlying conception that is developed along with the distance between historical events and their worshippers at a later time.

== Meaning of name ==
The word &quot;Gajah&quot; (elephant) refers to a large animal that is respected by other animals. In Hindu mythology it is believed to be a &quot;vahana&quot; (animal mount) of the god Indra. Elephants are also associated with Ganesha, the elephant-headed god with a human body, the son of Shiva and Parvati. As for the word &quot;Mada&quot;, in the ancient Javanese language (possibly derived from Sanskrit, where the word has the same meaning), it means &quot;drunk&quot;. When an elephant is drunk, he will walk arbitrarily and violently, overcoming all obstacles. So when it is associated with the figure of Gajah Mada, the name can be interpreted in two ways, namely:

# He considered himself to be the vehicle of the king, the executor of the king&#x27;s orders, just as the elephant Airavata became the &quot;vahana&quot; of the god Indra.
# He is a person who seems drunk and violent when faced with various obstacles that will hinder the progress of the kingdom. It really is the right choice of name and it seems that the name has been carefully thought out, its meaning having been previously used for his name.

In the Gajah Mada inscription, another nickname was used, namely &quot;Rakryan Mapatih Jirnnodhara&quot;. It is possible the name is just a title for Gajah Mada, but it can also be seen as the official name. The meaning of the word &quot;Jirnnodhara&quot; is &quot;builder of something new&quot; or &quot;restorer of something that has fallen apart&quot;. In a literal sense, Gajah Mada is the builder of &quot;caitya&quot; for Kertanegara, which did not exist before. In a figurative sense, he can be seen as a restorer and successor to Kertanegara&#x27;s ideas in the &quot;Dwipantara&quot; &quot;Mandala&quot; concept.

== Rise to power ==

Not much is known about Gajah Mada&#x27;s early life, but he was born into an ordinary family. Early accounts mention his career as a commander of the &quot;Bhayangkara&quot;, an elite royal guard for the Majapahit king and royal family.

When Rakrian Kuti, an official from Majapahit, rebelled against King Jayanegara (r. 1309–1328) in 1321, Gajah Mada and the mahapatih Arya Tadah rescued the king and his family by escaping from the capital city of Trowulan. Later Gajah Mada helped the king return to the capital and crush the rebellion. Seven years later, Jayanegara was murdered by the court physician Rakrian Tanca, an aide of Rakrian Kuti.

Another version suggests that Jayanegara was assassinated by Gajah Mada in 1328. Jayanegara was overly protective of his two half-sisters, born from Kertarajasa&#x27;s youngest queen, Dyah Dewi Gayatri. Complaints by the two young princesses led to the intervention of Gajah Mada. His solution was to arrange for a surgeon to murder the king while pretending to perform surgery.

Jayanegara was immediately succeeded by his half-sister Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi (r. 1328–1350). However, when she took the throne, the Sadeng and Keta region did not send their delegations, which was interpreted as a rebellion. This was later confirmed when Tribhuwana&#x27;s spies discovered that both regions were preparing for rebellions. Sadeng and Keta were coastal regions who were formerly conquered by Majapahit. However, the death of Nambi in 1316 (a local patih who was deemed instrumental in raising both regions) also contributed to the rebellion. At this time Sadeng was also led by a famed Majapahit general, Wirota Wiraganti.

While Gajah Mada was still currently a patih, he was sent by Tribhuwana with the advice of the sickly mahapatih Arya Tadah, to negotiate with rebel leaders in 1331. However, the Majapahit general Ra Kembar, a rival of Gajah Mada, preceded his arrival with his army to crush both rebellions. His men Jabung Tarewes, Lembu Peteng, dan Ikal-Ikalan Bang were also the ones implicated in the murder of Nambi.

This led to a conflict between Gajah Mada&#x27;s and Ra Kembar&#x27;s forces which was only resolved when Tribhuwana herself led the battles against both rebelling regions. After Arya Tadah&#x27;s retirement, Gajah Mada was picked as mahapatih in 1334. It was during Gajah Mada&#x27;s reign as mahapatih, around the year 1345, that the famous Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta visited Sumatra.

== Palapa oath and empire expansion ==
It is said that it was during his appointment as mahapatih under queen Tribhuwanatunggadewi that Gajah Mada took his famous oath, the &quot;Palapa Oath&quot; or &quot;Sumpah Palapa&quot;. The telling of the oath is described in the &quot;Pararaton&quot; (Book of Kings), an account of Javanese history that dates from the 15th or 16th century:

Translation:

Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder defines &quot;amukti palapa&quot; as &quot;enjoying a state where everything can be taken&quot;, or simply &quot;enjoying pleasure&quot;; while according to Slamet Muljana it means &quot;enjoying rest&quot;.

Even his closest friends were at first doubtful of his oath, but Gajah Mada kept pursuing his dream to unify Nusantara under the glory of Majapahit. Soon he conquered the surrounding territory of Bedahulu (Bali) and Lombok (1343). He then sent the navy westward to attack the remnants of the thalassocratic kingdom of Sriwijaya in Palembang. There he installed Adityawarman, a Majapahit prince, as vassal ruler of the Minangkabau in West Sumatra.

He then conquered the first Islamic sultanate in Southeast Asia, Samudra Pasai, and another state in Svarnadvipa (Sumatra). Gajah Mada also conquered Bintan, Tumasik (Singapore), Melayu (now known as Jambi), and Kalimantan.

At the resignation of queen Tribuwanatunggadewi, her son, Hayam Wuruk (ruled 1350–1389), became king. Gajah Mada retained his position as mahapatih under the new king and continued his military campaign by expanding eastward into Logajah, Gurun, Seram, Hutankadali, Sasak, Buton, Banggai, Kunir, Galiyan, Salayar, Sumba, Muar (Saparua), Solor, Bima, Wandan (Banda), Ambon, Timor, and Dompo.

He thus effectively brought the modern Indonesian archipelago under Majapahit control, which spanned not only the territory of today&#x27;s Indonesia but also that of Temasek (the historical name for Singapore), and the states comprising modern-day Malaysia, Brunei, the southern Philippines and East Timor.

According to the Gajah Mada inscription, dated 1273 Saka (1351 CE), in the month of Wesakha, Sang Mahamantrimukya Rakryan Mapatih Mpu Mada (Gajah Mada) commanded, created and inaugurated a sacred building of Caitya, dedicated for the late Paduka Bhatara Sang Lumah ri Siwa Buddha (King Kertanegara) who had died in 1214 Saka (1292 CE) in the month of Jyesta. The inscription was discovered in Singosari subdistrict, Malang, East Java, and was written in Old Javanese script and language. The &quot;caitya&quot; or temple mentioned in this inscription is possibly Singhasari temple. The special reverence to King Kertanegara of Singhasari demonstrated by Gajah Mada suggests that the mahapatih honoured the late king tremendously, and possibly the two are related. Some historian suggests that possibly Kertanegara was Gajah Mada&#x27;s grandfather.

== Bubat Incident ==
In 1357, the only remaining state refusing to acknowledge Majapahit&#x27;s hegemony was Sunda, in West Java, bordering the Majapahit Empire. King Hayam Wuruk intended to marry Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi, a princess of Sunda and the daughter of Sunda&#x27;s king. Gajah Mada was given the task to go to the &quot;Bubat&quot; square in the northern part of Trowulan to welcome the princess as she arrived with her father and escort to Majapahit palace.

Gajah Mada took this opportunity to demand Sunda submission to Majapahit rule. While the Sunda King thought that the royal marriage was a sign of a new alliance between Sunda and Majapahit, Gajah Mada thought otherwise. He stated that the Princess of Sunda was not to be hailed as the new queen consort of Majapahit, but merely as a concubine, as a sign of submission of Sunda to Majapahit. This misunderstanding led to embarrassment and hostility, which quickly rose into a skirmish and then the full-scale Battle of Bubat. The Sunda King with all of his guards as well as the royal party were overwhelmed by Majapahit troops and subsequently killed in the field of Bubat. Tradition holds that the heartbroken princess, Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi, committed suicide.

Hayam Wuruk was deeply shocked by the tragedy. Majapahit courtiers, ministers and nobles blamed Gajah Mada for his recklessness, and the brutal consequences were not to the taste of the Majapahit royal family. Gajah Mada was promptly demoted and spent the rest of his days at the estate of Madakaripura in Probolinggo in East Java.

==Death==
Gajah Mada died in obscurity in 1364, at the age of 74. King Hayam Wuruk considered the power Gajah Mada had accumulated during his time as &quot;mahapatih&quot; too much to handle for a single person. Therefore, the king split the responsibilities that had been Gajah Mada&#x27;s, between four separate new &quot;mahamantri&quot; (equal to ministries), thereby probably increasing his own power. King Hayam Wuruk, who is said to have been a wise leader, was able to maintain the hegemony of Majapahit in the region that was gained during Gajah Mada&#x27;s service. However, Majapahit slowly fell into decline after the death of Hayam Wuruk.

== Legacy ==
His reign helped further Indianisation of Javanese culture through the spread of Hinduism and sanskritization.

The Blahbatuh royal house in Gianyar, Bali, has been performing Gajah Mada&#x27;s mask dance drama ritually for the past 600 years. The mask of Gajah Mada has been protected and brought to life every couple of years to unite and harmonize the world, this sacred ritual was intended to bring peace to Bali.

Gajah Mada&#x27;s legacy is important for Indonesian Nationalism, and invoked by the Indonesian Nationalist movement in the early 20th century. The Nationalists prior to the Japanese invasion, notably Sukarno and Mohammad Yamin, often cited Gajah Mada&#x27;s oath and Nagarakretagama as the inspiration and a historical proof of Indonesian past greatness — that Indonesians could unite, despite vast territory and various cultures. The Gajah Mada campaign that united the far flung islands within the Indonesian archipelago under Majapahit suzerainty, was used by Indonesian nationalists to argue that an ancient form of unity had existed prior to Dutch colonialism. Thus, Gajah Mada was a great inspiration during the Indonesian National Revolution for independence from Dutch colonization.

In 1942, only 230 Indonesian natives held a tertiary education. The Republicans sought to mend the Dutch apathy and established the first state university, which freely admitted native &quot;pribumi&quot; Indonesians. &quot;Universitas Gadjah Mada&quot;, in Yogyakarta is named in honour of Gajah Mada and was completed in 1945, and had the honour of being the first Medicine Faculty freely open to natives.

Launched on 9 July 1976, Indonesia&#x27;s first telecommunication satellite was called &quot;Satelit Palapa&quot; signifying its role in uniting the vast archipelagic nation.

The Army Military Police Corps of the Indonesian Army has honored Gajah Mada as their unit symbol. The symbol of the Army MP corps also has the picture of Gajah Mada.

Many cities in Indonesia have streets named after Gajah Mada, such as Jalan Gajah Mada and Jalan Hayam Wuruk. There is a brand of badminton shuttlecock named after him as well.

<text>The Delhi Durbar (lit. &quot;Court of Delhi&quot;) was an Indian imperial-style mass assembly organized by Britain at Coronation Park, Delhi, India, to mark the succession of an Emperor or Empress of India. Also known as the Imperial Durbar, it was held three times, in 1877, 1903, and 1911, at the height of the British Empire. The 1911 Durbar was the only one that a sovereign, George V, attended. The term was derived from the common Persian term &quot;durbar&quot;.

==Durbar of 1877==
Called the &quot;Proclamation Durbar&quot;, the Durbar of 1877, for which the organisation was undertaken by Thomas Henry Thornton, was held beginning on 1 January 1877 to proclaim Queen Victoria as Empress of India by the British. The 1877 Durbar was largely an official event and not a popular occasion with mass participation like later durbars in 1903 and 1911. It was attended by the 1st Earl of Lytton—Viceroy of India, maharajas, nawabs and intellectuals.

Inside the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta is an inscription taken from the message of Queen Victoria presented at the 1877 Durbar to the people of India:

We trust that the present occasion may tend to unite in bonds of close affection ourselves and our subjects; that from the highest to the humblest, all may feel that under our rule the great principles of liberty, equity, and justice are secured to them; and to promote their happiness, to add to their prosperity, and advance their welfare, are the ever present aims and objects of our Empire.

The Empress of India Medal to commemorate the proclamation of the Queen as Empress of India was struck and distributed to the honoured guests, and the elderly Ramanath Tagore was raised to the status of an honorary Raja by Lord Lytton, viceroy of India.

It was at this glittering durbar that Ganesh Vasudeo Joshi, wearing &quot;&quot;homespun spotless white khadi&quot; rose to read a citation on behalf of the grass roots native political organization, the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, which organization presaged the later rise of the Indian National Congress. Joshi&#x27;s speech put forth a demand couched in very polite language:

Her Majesty to grant to India the same political and social status as is enjoyed by her British subjects.

With this demand, it can be said that the campaign for Indian Independence was formally launched, which was the beginning of a great transformation for India.

The durbar would later be seen as controversial because it directed funds away from the Great Famine of 1876–78.

==Durbar of 1903==
The durbar was held to celebrate the succession of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra as Emperor and Empress of India. The two full weeks of festivities were devised in meticulous detail by Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. It was a dazzling display of pomp, power, and split-second timing. Neither the earlier Delhi Durbar of 1877, nor the later Durbar held there in 1911, could match the pageantry of Lord Curzon&#x27;s 1903 festivities. In a few short months at the end of 1902, a deserted plain was transformed into an elaborate tented city, complete with temporary light railway to bring crowds of spectators out from Delhi, a post office with its own stamps, telephone and telegraphic facilities, a variety of stores, a police force with specially designed uniforms, a hospital, a magistrate&#x27;s court and complex sanitation, drainage, and electric light installations. Souvenir guidebooks were sold and maps of the camping ground distributed. Marketing opportunities were craftily exploited. A special Delhi Durbar Medal was struck, as part of the celebrations.

Edward VII, to Curzon&#x27;s disappointment, did not attend but sent his brother, the Duke of Connaught who arrived with a mass of dignitaries by train from Bombay just as Curzon and his government came in the other direction from Calcutta. The assembly awaiting them displayed possibly the greatest collection of jewels to be seen in one place. Each of the Indian princes was adorned with the most spectacular of his gems from the collections of centuries. Maharajahs came with great retinues from all over India, many of them meeting for the first time while the massed ranks of the Indian armies, under their Commander-in-Chief Lord Kitchener, paraded, played their bands, and restrained the crowds of common people.

On the first day, the Curzons entered the area of festivities, together with the maharajahs, riding on elephants, some with huge gold candelabra stuck on their tusks. The durbar ceremony itself fell on New Year&#x27;s Day and was followed by days of polo and other sports, dinners, balls, military reviews, bands, and exhibitions. The world&#x27;s press dispatched their best journalists, artists and photographers to cover proceedings. The popularity of movie footage of the event, shown in makeshift cinemas throughout India, is often credited with having launched the country&#x27;s early film industry.

The India Post issued a set of two commemorative souvenir sheets with special cancellation struck on 1 January 1903 – 12 noon, a much sought-after item for stamp collectors today.

The event culminated in a grand coronation ball attended only by the highest-ranking guests, presided over by Lord Curzon and Lady Curzon in her jewels and peacock gown.

==Durbar of 1911==


On 22 March 1911, a royal proclamation announced that the Durbar would be held in December to commemorate the coronation in Britain a few months earlier of King George V and Queen Mary and allow their proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India. Every governor and all the rulers of princely states in India were summoned to pay obeisance.

The King and Queen left Portsmouth on 11 November aboard , a new P&amp;O ocean liner, arriving in Delhi on 7 December in a grand State Entry through the city gates in which 50,000 troops participated, led by Lord Kitchener, the Commander-in-Chief, India. Escorted by a guard of the Household Cavalry, the King rode an Australian charger and was dressed in military uniform with a plumed pith helmet, to the disappointment of the people in the crowd, who had been expecting him to be riding an elephant and wearing a crown. The Queen followed in an open carriage. The following days were taken up with receptions for the Indian princes, a church parade and the presentation of regimental colours.

The Durbar itself was on Tuesday, 12 December, at Coronation Park, on which a semi-circular grandstand had been built for 10,000 government officials and other dignitaries, while further back an artificial mound seated 50,000 local people. The royal couple arrived in their Coronation robes, the King-Emperor wearing the Imperial Crown of India with eight arches, containing 6,100 diamonds, and covered with sapphires, emeralds and rubies, with a velvet and miniver cap all weighing 34 ounces (965 g). Seated on thrones, they listened as the Delhi Herald Extraordinary, Brigadier-General William Peyton, read out the proclamation in English, followed by the Assistant Herald, Captain Malik Umar Hayat Khan, who read it in Urdu. They received homage from the native princes – including one woman, the Begum of Bhopal – at the shamiana (ceremonial tent); controversy ensued when the Gaekwar of Baroda, Maharajah Sayajirao III, approached the royal couple without his jewellery on, and after a simple bow turned his back to them when leaving. His action was interpreted at the time as a sign of dissent to British rule. Afterwards, the royal couple ascended to the domed royal pavilion, where the King-Emperor announced the move of India&#x27;s capital from Calcutta to Delhi. The annulment of the partition of Bengal was also announced during the ceremony. After the departure of the king and queen, the enthusiastic crowd surged into the arena.

On the following day, 13 December, the royal couple made a &quot;Jharokha Darshan&quot; (balcony appearance) at the Red Fort, to receive half a million or more of the common people who had come to greet them, a custom which was started by Mughal emperors. On 14 December, the King-Emperor presided over a military review of 40,000 troops, culminating in a great cavalry charge. There followed an investiture in Delhi Park, the first was the Queen who received the Order of the Star of India. 26,800 Delhi Durbar Medals in silver were awarded to the men and officers of the British and Indian Armies who participated in the 1911 event. A further two hundred were struck in gold, a hundred of which were awarded to Indian princely rulers and the highest ranking government officers.

Following the Durbar, the King and Queen left for ten days in Nepal, where the King was taken tiger hunting. After visiting Calcutta, they journeyed across India by train to Bombay, which they left on 10 January on RMS &quot;Medina&quot;.

A feature film of the event titled &quot;With Our King and Queen Through India&quot; (1912) – also known as &quot;The Durbar in Delhi&quot; – was filmed in the early color process Kinemacolor and released on 2 February 1912.

Generally the Durbar achieved its purpose of cementing support for British rule among the native princes, as was demonstrated by the support given during the First World War.

Today, the Coronation Park in Delhi is sometimes used for big religious festivals and municipal conventions. The thrones used by King George V and Queen Mary are on display at Marble Hall Gallery and Museum at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

==Postponed Durbar of 1937 or 1938==

On the death of George V in January 1936, his eldest son acceded as Edward VIII. In his first and only speech from the throne at the State Opening of Parliament in November 1936, he announced that he would attend a Durbar in Delhi during the winter following his coronation in 1937. When Edward abdicated in December 1936, it was initially envisaged that his brother George VI would continue with the Durbar as already planned, with the enthusiastic backing of the Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland and the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. However, persuaded by the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin and his doctors, George decided that travelling to India in the aftermath of his coronation in May would place too great a strain on his health, and it was announced on 9 February 1937 that the Durbar had been postponed until &quot;a later date&quot;. The reason given was that it was &quot;impossible to contemplate a prolonged absence during the first year of his reign&quot;, so as not to give credence to rumours circulating about the king&#x27;s physical and mental wellbeing.

By August 1937, the situation in India had changed. The Government of India Act 1935 had set in motion modest moves towards Indian self government; the pro-independence Indian National Congress had dominated the 1937 Indian provincial elections in seven out of eleven provinces, and had made it clear that they would not only boycott the Durbar but refuse to vote the funds to pay for it. Linlithgow wrote to Zetland in August saying that the king ought to be warned of &quot;unpleasantness&quot; if he visited India. Zetland took up the matter with the new prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, while the viceroy sought the opinion of the provincial governors, who were all against the idea. Meanwhile, Jawaharlal Nehru, the leader of the Congress party, told the Indian press that if the British Government wanted to protect the king from any sort of &quot;untoward incident&quot;, then they ought to &quot;keep him in England&quot;.

Chamberlain was persuaded and initially omitted any mention of royal visit to India from the king&#x27;s speech of October 1937, but under pressure from the king and against the advice of the viceroy, included the non-committal line; &quot;I am looking forward with interest and pleasure to the time when it will be possible for Me to visit My Indian Empire&quot;. Linlithgow and Zetland then made a determined effort to dissuade the king from visiting India, even on a more modest scale, using the pretext of finance rather than Indian politics. Quoting a cost of £1 million, all of which would fall on the central government of India and which, they advised, the Indian Finance Minister, James Grigg, was unwilling to support. Finally, in February 1938, the king had to be formally advised by Chamberlain to again postpone any visit &quot;until the general world outlook has become more settled and the financial prospects [are] more definite&quot;.

Eventually, the onset of the Second World War and the movement towards Indian independence rendered the prospect of any royal visit nearly impossible.

<doc id="771099" wikidata="Q1201334" url="?curid=771099" title="Toshihiko Seki">
<text>is a Japanese actor, voice actor, singer and narrator. In June 2004, Seki was honored by the readers of Animage Magazine in the 26th Annual Reader&#x27;s Poll, where he was ranked the 9th favorite voice actor, largely in recognition of his performance as Rau Le Creuset from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;. In August 2007 the Anime News Network called him one of the more prolific male voice actors with 215 roles credited to his name. Seki often voices characters who are very serious or easily agitated like Duo Maxwell in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, Iruka Umino in &quot;Naruto&quot;, Kaien Shiba in &quot;Bleach&quot; and Genjo Sanzo in Saiyuki but he also plays deranged villains like Legato Bluesummers, Rau Le Creuset, Embryo, Il Dottore and Muzan Kibutsuji. His most famous role is the Imagin Momotaros from &quot;Kamen Rider Den-O&quot;, reprising the role numerous productions since then. In 2023, he starred as the voice of the titular character in &quot;Pluto&quot;.

<text>Cassandra Gay Peterson (born September 17, 1951) is an American actress best known for her portrayal of the horror hostess character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Peterson gained fame on Los Angeles television station KHJ-TV in her stage persona as Elvira, hosting &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;, a weekly B movie presentation. A member of the Los Angeles-based improvisational and sketch comedy troupe The Groundlings, Peterson based her Elvira persona in part on a &quot;Valley girl&quot;-type character she created while a member of the troupe.

The popularity of &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot; led to the 1988 film &quot;&quot;, and later the 2001 film &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Haunted Hills&quot;, both starring Peterson as Elvira. The television show was revived in 2010, featuring Elvira hosting public domain films, and airing on This TV until 2011. Elvira returned as a horror hostess in 2014 with &quot;13 Nights of Elvira&quot;, a 13-episode series produced by Hulu, and again in 2021 for a one-night 40th Anniversary Special that aired on Shudder.

Peterson has made cameo appearances as Elvira in a number of films and television programs, including appearing as a guest commentator during WrestleMania 2 and as a guest judge on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, &quot;The Boulet Brothers&#x27; Dragula&quot;, and &quot;Halloween Wars&quot;.

==Early life==
Peterson was born on September 17, 1951 in Manhattan, Kansas. When she was a toddler, she was scalded by boiling water, which required skin grafts to cover over 35% of her body to heal, resulting in her having to spend three months in the hospital.

In a 2011 interview, Peterson stated that as a child, she was more fascinated by horror-themed toys while other girls were occupied with Barbie dolls. In elementary school, she watched &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, which was the first horror film she ever saw. During her teens, Peterson worked as a drag queen go-go dancer in a Colorado Springs, Colorado gay bar and as a go-go dancer at &quot;Club A-Go-Go&quot;, a nightclub in Colorado Springs, and for soldiers at Fort Carson. She graduated from Palmer High School in Colorado Springs.

==Career==
===Early career===
Inspired by Ann-Margret in the film &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, while on a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, during high school, she convinced her parents to let her see a live show where she was noticed by the production staff; despite being only 17 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sign a contract. Immediately after graduating high school, she drove back to Las Vegas, where she became a showgirl in Frederic Apcar&#x27;s pioneering &quot;Vive Les Girls!&quot; at The Dunes; there, she met Elvis Presley, with whom she went on a date. She had a small role as a showgirl beside Shady Tree (Leonard Barr) in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971) and played a topless dancer in the film &quot;The Working Girls&quot; (1974).

In the early 1970s, Peterson moved to Italy and became lead singer of the Italian rock bands I Latins 80 and The Snails. After being introduced to film director Federico Fellini by the producer of a documentary on Las Vegas showgirls in which she had appeared, she landed a small part in the film &quot;Roma&quot; (1972). When she returned to the United States, she worked at the Playboy Club in Miami as a showgirl in the 1973 revue &quot;Fantasies of Love au Naturel&quot; and later signed up with Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy Modeling Agency, working as a hostess and model. She also toured nightclubs and discos around the country with a musical/comedy act, Mama&#x27;s Boys.

In her 2021 memoir &quot;Yours Cruelly, Elvira&quot;, she writes, &quot;Perhaps the biggest mistake I made in my twenties was posing nude for a husband-and-wife photography team, who bullshitted me into doing what they said was a &#x27;test shoot&#x27; for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. They guaranteed me it would never be seen anywhere publicly.&quot; She adds, &quot;I never saw or heard from them again, and as far as I knew, that was the end of that... until 1981 when I became famous. Those photos, pubic hair and all, appeared in every sleazy men&#x27;s magazine on the stand and there wasn&#x27;t a damn thing I could do about it.&quot; However, Peterson appeared in several adult magazines in the 1970s including &quot;Modern Man&quot;, &quot;Playgirl&quot;, and &quot;Swank&quot;, among others.

In 1979, she joined the Los Angeles-based improvisational troupe The Groundlings, where she created a Valley girl-type character upon whom the Elvira persona is largely based.

Peterson was one of two finalists for the role of Ginger Grant for the third &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; television movie in 1981, but was dropped before filming. Shortly after that, KHJ-TV offered her the horror host position.

===Elvira===
====Elvira begins: &quot;Movie Macabre&quot;====
In 1981, six years after the death of Larry Vincent, who starred as host Sinister Seymour of a Los Angeles weekend horror show called &quot;Fright Night&quot;, show producers began to bring the show back.

The producers decided to use a hostess. They asked 1950s&#x27; horror hostess Maila Nurmi to revive &quot;The Vampira Show&quot;. Nurmi worked on the project for a short time, but quit when the producers would not hire Lola Falana to play Vampira. The station sent out a casting call, and Peterson auditioned and won the role. Producers left it up to her to create the role&#x27;s image. She and her best friend, Robert Redding, came up with the sexy goth/vampire look after producers rejected her original idea to look like Sharon Tate&#x27;s character in &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;. They created the Elvira look by drawing inspiration from a Kabuki makeup book and the hairstyles of The Ronettes.

Shortly before the first taping, producers received a cease and desist letter from Nurmi. Besides the similarities in the format and costumes, Elvira&#x27;s closing line for each show, wishing her audience &quot;Unpleasant dreams,&quot; was notably similar to Vampira&#x27;s closer: &quot;Bad dreams, darlings...&quot; uttered as she walked off down a misty corridor. The court ruled in favor of Peterson, holding that &quot;&#x27;likeness&#x27; means actual representation of another person&#x27;s appearance, and not simply close resemblance.&quot; Peterson claimed that Elvira was nothing like Vampira aside from the basic design of the black dress and black hair. Nurmi claimed that Vampira&#x27;s image was based on Morticia Addams, a character in Charles Addams&#x27;s cartoons that appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.

Peterson&#x27;s Elvira character rapidly gained notice with her tight-fitting, low-cut, cleavage-displaying black gown. Adopting the flippant tone of a California &quot;Valley girl&quot;, she brought a satirical, sarcastic edge to her commentary. She reveled in dropping risqué double entendres and making frequent jokes about her cleavage. In an &quot;AOL Entertainment News&quot; interview, Peterson said, &quot;I figured out that Elvira is me when I was a teenager. She&#x27;s a spastic girl. I just say what I feel and people seem to enjoy it.&quot; Her camp humor, sex appeal, and good-natured self-mockery made her popular with late-night movie viewers and her popularity soared.

The Elvira character soon evolved from an obscure cult figure to a lucrative brand. She was associated with many products through the 1980s and 1990s, including Halloween costumes, comic books, action figures, trading cards, pinball machines, Halloween decor, model kits, calendars, perfume and dolls. She has appeared on the cover of &quot;Femme Fatales&quot; magazine five times. In 1984, she hosted her own six-hour Halloween special on MTV, which included skits and music videos and returned to host another four hour Halloween special in 1986. That same year, she also was a guest commentator at Wrestlemania 2 in the Los Angeles segments alongside Jesse Ventura and Lord Alfred Hayes. Elvira&#x27;s popularity reached its zenith with the release of the 1988 feature film &quot;&quot;, on whose script, written directly for the screen, Peterson collaborated with John Paragon and Sam Egan. From 1989 through 1991, Peterson appeared as Elvira in a series of commercials promoting World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s annual Halloween Havoc pay-per-view events.

After several years of attempts to make a sequel to &quot;Elvira: Mistress of the Dark,&quot; Cassandra and her manager and then-husband Mark Pierson decided to finance a second movie. In November 2000, Peterson wrote, again in collaboration with Paragon, and co-produced &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Haunted Hills.&quot; The film was shot in Romania for just under one million dollars. With little budget left for promotion, Cassandra and Mark screened the film at AIDS charity fund raisers across America. For many people in attendance, this was their first opportunity to see the woman behind the Elvira character. On July 5, 2002, &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Haunted Hills&quot; had its official premiere in Hollywood. Elvira arrived at the premiere in her Macabre Mobile. The film was later screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

In September 2010, &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot; returned to television syndication, this time with public domain films. In October 2014, it was revealed that a new series of thirteen episodes had been produced, &quot;13 Nights of Elvira&quot; for Hulu. The show premiered on October 19, 2014, running through to Halloween.

As of September 2018, Peterson was working to develop a direct sequel to 1988&#x27;s &quot;Elvira: Mistress of the Dark,&quot; as well as an animated Elvira project.

===Elvira on home video===
In 1985, Elvira began hosting a home video series called &quot;ThrillerVideo&quot;, a division of International Video Entertainment (IVE). Many of these films were hand-selected by Peterson. Choosing to stay away from the more explicit cannibal, slasher and zombie films of the time, these were generally tamer films such as &quot;The Monster Club&quot; and Dan Curtis television films, as well as many episodes of the &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot; television series. Since she had refused to host &quot;Make Them Die Slowly,&quot; &quot;Seven Doors of Death,&quot; and &quot;Buried Alive,&quot; however, the videos were released on the &quot;ThrillerVideo&quot; label without Elvira&#x27;s appearance as hostess. After this, several extended episodes of the British namesake series &quot;Thriller&quot; (i.e., &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Web,&quot; &quot;A Killer in Every Corner,&quot; &quot;Murder Motel&quot;) were also released without an appearance by Elvira; in some, such as &quot;Buried Alive,&quot; the cast replaced her.

The success of the &quot;Thriller Video&quot; series led to a second video set, &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Midnight Madness&quot;, released through Rhino Home Video. In 2004 a DVD horror-film collection called &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Box of Horrors&quot; was released, marking Elvira&#x27;s return to horror-movie hostessing after a ten-year absence.

====Unaired pilot for &quot;The Elvira Show&quot; on CBS====
In 1993, she filmed a pilot for CBS called &quot;The Elvira Show.&quot; An expansion of the 1988 film with a sitcom setting, the premise had Elvira and her family moving into a new neighborhood with her older aunt and dealing with nosy neighbors and uptight conservatives who all want them to move out. It also starred Katherine Helmond, Phoebe Augustine, Cristine Rose, Ted Henning, Lynne Marie Stewart, Claudette Wells, John Paragon, Laurie Faso, and Basil Hoffman. It was not picked up by a TV network.

=== Unrealized film projects ===
In an interview with Josh Korngut on Dread Central&#x27;s &quot;Development Hell&quot; podcast, Peterson revealed cancelled plans for an Elvira &quot;buddy comedy&quot; where the Mistress of the Dark took a road-trip to hell. She also detailed plans for an Edward Scissorhands-inspired animated feature film revealing Elvira&#x27;s origins with the holiday of Halloween.

===Non-Elvira career===
Peterson has also portrayed non-Elvira roles in many other films, most notably &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; in 1985 alongside friend and fellow Groundling Paul Reubens, who starred as his Pee-wee Herman character; &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold,&quot; released in 1987, which starred Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone; and 2010&#x27;s &quot;All About Evil,&quot; as a mother named Linda Thompson who says not to go to the old theater to watch scary movies. Peterson also appeared in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;The Munsters&quot; movie in 2022.

==Personal life==
In the 1970s, Peterson had a liaison with Jon Voight as well as with Robert De Niro during the filming of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Peterson married musician Mark Pierson in 1981, and he soon became her personal manager. They had one daughter. They divorced in 2003.

Peterson released her memoir, &quot;Yours Cruelly, Elvira: Memoirs of the Mistress of the Dark&quot;, on September 21, 2021. She revealed in the book that she has been in a relationship with a woman, Teresa &quot;T&quot; Wierson, since 2002. They began their romantic relationship following Peterson&#x27;s separation from her husband. In the book, she also accused basketball player Wilt Chamberlain of raping her during a party at his Bel Air mansion in the 1970s.

Peterson was a vegetarian for many years; as of 2021, she continues to maintain a &quot;mostly vegetarian&quot; diet.

<doc id="771103" wikidata="Q2528346" url="?curid=771103" title="Statolatry">
<text>Statolatry is a term formed from the word &quot;state&quot; and a suffix derived from the Latin and Greek word &quot;latria&quot;, meaning &quot;worship&quot;. It first appeared in Giovanni Gentile&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of Fascism&quot;, published in 1931 under Mussolini&#x27;s name, and was also mentioned in Gramsci&#x27;s Prison Notebooks (1971) sometime between 1931–1932, while he was imprisoned by Mussolini. The same year, the encyclical &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot; by Pope Pius XI criticized Fascist Italy as developing &quot;a pagan worship of the state&quot; which it called &quot;statolatry&quot;.

The term politiolatry was used to describe reason of state doctrine in the 17th century with similar intent.

== Ludwig von Mises&#x27; &quot;Omnipotent Government&quot; (1944) ==

The term was also used and popularized by Ludwig von Mises in his 1944 work &quot;Omnipotent Government&quot;. Mises defines statolatry as being literally worship of the State analogous to &quot;idolatry&quot; (worship of idols). Statolatry asserts that the glorification and aggrandizement of &#x27;State&#x27; or &#x27;Nation&#x27; is the object of all legitimate human aspiration at the expense of all else, including personal welfare and independent thought. Expansion of the power and influence of one&#x27;s State is to be achieved, if necessary, through aggressive war and colonial adventures (i.e. imperialism). It far exceeds the patriotism of those who recognize the rights of people other than themselves to self-determination, and might best be described as super-patriotism or chauvinism.

<doc id="771108" wikidata="Q2060657" url="?curid=771108" title="Singhasari">
<text>Singhasari ( or , ), also known as Tumapel, was a Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingdom located in east Java between 1222 and 1292. The kingdom succeeded the Kingdom of Kediri as the dominant kingdom in eastern Java. The kingdom&#x27;s name is cognate to the Singosari district of Malang Regency, located several kilometres north of Malang City.

==Etymology==
Singhasari (alternate spelling: &quot;Singosari&quot;) was mentioned in several Javanese manuscripts, including Pararaton. According to tradition, the name was given by Ken Arok during the foundation of the new kingdom to replace its old name, Tumapel, located in a fertile highland valley which today corresponds to the area in and around Malang city. It derives from Sanskrit word &quot;singha&quot; which means &quot;lion&quot; and &quot;sari&quot; which in Old Javanese could mean either &quot;essence&quot; or &quot;to sleep&quot;. Thus Singhasari could be translated as &quot;essence of lion&quot; or &quot;sleeping lion&quot;. Although the lion is not an endemic animal of Java, the symbolic depiction of lions is common in Indonesian culture, attributed to the influence of Hindu-Buddhist symbolism.

==Foundation==

Singhasari was founded by Ken Arok (1182–1227/1247), whose story is a popular folktale in Central and East Java. Most of Ken Arok&#x27;s life story and the early history of Singhasari were taken from the Pararaton account, which also incorporates some mythical aspects. Ken Arok was an orphan born of a mother named Ken Endok and an unknown father (some tales stated he was a son of the god Brahma) in the Kediri kingdom&#x27;s territory.

Ken Arok rose from being a servant of Tunggul Ametung, a regional ruler in Tumapel (present-day Malang) to becoming a ruler of Java from Kediri. He is considered the founder of the Rajasa dynasty of both the Singhasari and later the Majapahit line of monarchs. He killed Tunggul Ametung and was later assassinated by Anusapati, in revenge for killing his father, Tunggul Ametung. Ken Arok&#x27;s son Panji Tohjaya assassinated Anusapati, but he in turn reigned only a few months in 1248 before his nephews revolted. These two, Ranga Wuni and Mahisha Champaka, ruled together under the names Vishnuvardhana and Narasimhamurti.

==Expansion==
In the year 1275, King Kertanegara, the fifth ruler of Singhasari who had been reigning since 1254, launched a peaceful naval campaign northward towards the weak remains of the Srivijaya in response to continuous Ceylon pirate raids and Chola kingdom&#x27;s invasion from India which conquered Srivijaya&#x27;s Kedah in 1025. The strongest of these Malaya kingdoms was Jambi, which captured the Srivijaya capital in 1088, followed by the Dharmasraya Kingdom, and the Temasek Kingdom of Singapore.

The military force known as the Pamalayu expedition was led by Admiral Mahesa Anabrang (a.k.a. Adwaya Brahman) to the Malaya region, and was also intended to secure the Malayan strait, the ‘Maritime Silk Road’, against potential Mongol invasion and ferocious sea pirates. These Malayan kingdoms then pledged allegiance to the king. King Kertanegara had long wished to surpass Srivijaya as a regional maritime empire, controlling sea trade routes from China to India.

The Pamalayu expedition from 1275 to 1292, from the time of Singhasari to Majapahit, is chronicled in the Javanese scroll Nagarakrtagama. Singhasari&#x27;s territory thus became Majapahit territory. In the year 1284, King Kertanegara led a hostile Pabali expedition to Bali, which integrated Bali into the Singhasari kingdom&#x27;s territory. The king also sent troops, expeditions, and envoys to other nearby kingdoms such as the Sunda-Galuh Kingdom, Pahang Kingdom, Balakana Kingdom (Kalimantan/Borneo), and Gurun Kingdom (Maluku). He also established an alliance with the king of Champa (Vietnam).

King Kertanegara erased any Srivijayan influence from Java and Bali in 1290. However, the expansive campaigns exhausted most of the Kingdom&#x27;s military forces and in the future would stir a murderous plot against the unsuspecting King Kertanegara.

==Conflict with the Mongols==
Singhasari, and its successor kingdom, Majapahit, were among the few kingdoms in Asia that were able to thwart an invasion by the Mongol horde by repelling a Mongol force in 1293. As the centre of the Malayan peninsula trade winds, the rising power, influence, and wealth of the Javanese Singhasari empire came to the attention of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Yuan dynasty based in China. Moreover, Singhasari had allied with Champa, another powerful state in the region. Both Java (Singhasari) and Champa were worried about Mongol expansion and raids against neighbouring states, such as their raid of Bagan in Burma.

Kublai Khan then sent emissaries demanding submission and tribute from Java. In 1280, Kublai Khan sent the first emissary to King Kertanegara, demanding Singhasari&#x27;s submission and tribute to the great Khan. The demand was refused. The next year in 1281, the Khan sent another envoy, demanding the same, which was refused again. Eight years later, in 1289, the last envoy was sent to demand the same, and King Kertanegara refused to pay tribute.In the audition throne room of the Singhasari court, King Kertanegara humiliated the Khan&#x27;s envoy by cutting and scarring the face of Meng Ki, one of the Mongols&#x27; envoys (some sources even state that the king cut the envoy&#x27;s ear himself). The envoy returned to China with the answer – the scar – of the Javan king written on his face.

Enraged by this humiliation and the disgrace committed against his envoy and his patience, in late 1292 Kublai Khan sent 1,000 war junks for a punitive expedition that arrived off the coast of Tuban, Java in early 1293.

King Kertanegara, whose troops were now spread thin and located elsewhere, did not realize that a coup was being prepared by the former Kediri royal lineage.

==Fall of Singhasari==

In 1292, Regent Jayakatwang, a vassal king from the Kingdom of Daha (also known as Kediri or Gelang-gelang), prepared his army to conquer Singhasari and kill its king if possible, assisted by Arya Viraraja, a regent from Sumenep on the island of Madura.

The Kediri (Gelang-gelang) army attacked Singhasari simultaneously from both north and south. The king only realized the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya, informally known as &#x27;Raden Wijaya&#x27;, northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was put at bay, but the southern attackers successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the Tantra sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.

Having learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja due to Kediri&#x27;s treachery, Raden Wijaya tried to defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora, and Nambi, went to exile in favour of the same regent (Bupati) Arya Wiraraja of Madura, Nambi&#x27;s father, who then turned his back to Jayakatwang. With Arya Wiraraja&#x27;s patronage, Raden Wijaya, pretending to submit to King Jayakatwang, won favour from the new monarch of Kediri, who permitted him to open a new settlement north of Mount Arjuna, the Tarik forest. In this wilderness, Wijaya found many bitter Maja fruits, so it was called Majapahit (literally meaning “bitter Maja”), the future capital of the empire.

==The beginning of Majapahit empire==

In early 1293, the Mongol naval forces arrived on the north coast of Java (near Tuban) and on the Brantas River mouth to flank what they thought was Singhasari. Raden Wijaya found the opportunity to use the unsuspecting Mongols to overthrow Jayakatwang. Raden Wijaya&#x27;s army allied with the Mongols in March 1293 and a battle ensued between Mongol forces against Daha forces in the creek bed of Kali Mas River, a distributary of Brantas River, which was followed by the battle of Mongol forces against Daha forces that attacked the Majapahit regional army led by Raden Wijaya. The Mongols then stormed Daha and Jayakatwang finally surrendered and was executed.

Once Jayakatwang was eliminated, Raden Vijaya then turned his troops on his former Mongol allies, forcing them to withdraw from the island of Java on 31 May 1293.

The victor, Prince Wijaya, son-in-law of Kertanegara, the last Singhasari king, then ascended the throne as Kertajasa Jayawardhana, the first king of the great Majapahit Empire, on 12 November 1293.

<text>Winnipeg Arena was an indoor arena located in the Polo Park district of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

The arena was the city&#x27;s premier ice hockey venue from 1955 to 2004 and is best remembered as the home of the first Winnipeg Jets franchise, which played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979 and the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1996. It was also home to junior and minor league teams such as the Manitoba Moose (1996–2004) and Winnipeg Warriors (1955–1961). The arena closed after the completion of the MTS Centre in November 2004 and was later demolished. A retail and commercial complex occupies the site today.

==History==

===Early years (1955–1972)===

Construction on a new facility to replace Winnipeg&#x27;s obsolete Shea&#x27;s Amphitheatre began in October 1954. Situated between Winnipeg Stadium and Polo Park, the new arena opened its doors for the 1955–56 hockey season and, in its original configuration, had a seating capacity of approximately 9,500. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Winnipeg Arena was considered to be among the finest facilities in the western half of North America.
The Winnipeg Arena&#x27;s grand opening occurred in conjunction with the first hockey game played on October 18, 1955, a Western Hockey League minor pro game between the Winnipeg Warriors and the Calgary Stampeders. The ceremonial opening face-off was conducted by Warriors Hockey Club president J. D. Perrin Sr. before a sell-out crowd (including standing room) of 9,671, a then-record for the league. The following year, Perrin offered to purchase the arena and Winnipeg Stadium from Winnipeg Enterprises Corporation. In keeping with the tenor of the times, when public ownership was thought to be advantageous, the offer was rejected. The Warriors called the arena home until 1961, when the club was sold and relocated. Six years later, the arena found a new tenant in the Winnipeg Jets junior hockey club when it began play in the new Western Hockey League. The club would later be renamed the Monarchs and played at the arena until 1977.

On September 6, 1972, the Winnipeg Arena found itself in the international spotlight when it hosted the third game of the &quot;Summit Series&quot; between Canada and the Soviet Union. Approximately 9,800 spectators packed the arena to witness the two teams battle to a 4–4 draw.

===Winnipeg Jets era (1972–1996)===

A new era for the Winnipeg Arena began in the fall of 1972 when the city&#x27;s new professional hockey team, the Winnipeg Jets, entered the upstart WHA. Their on-ice success during the 1970s brought three WHA championship banners to the rafters of the arena and made the Jets the pride of the city and province.
In 1979, the Jets were one of four teams admitted into the National Hockey League following the demise of the WHA, which necessitated a major expansion to the arena to meet the NHL&#x27;s minimum capacity. The seating capacity was expanded to 15,565, mostly through the construction of upper decks on the east and west sides. The construction of these upper decks created an overhang above the lower deck seating areas, obstructing views according to many spectators. That same year, a painting of Queen Elizabeth II was commissioned for the arena by Francis Lawrence Jobin, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The painting measured (one of the largest ever painted of the Queen) and hung from the arena&#x27;s rafters. A White Way sign centre-hung scoreboard with colour matrix animation boards replaced an American Sign and Indicator centre-hung scoreboard in 1985. The American Sign and Indicator scoreboard, in use since the 1980–1981 season, was moved to Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario.

During the 1980s, a tradition known as the &quot;White Out&quot; was initiated in which boisterous and sometimes raucous fans dressed in all-white during playoff games to create an intimidating environment for opposing teams. This led to the Winnipeg Arena&#x27;s reputation as one of the loudest sports venues in North America during the 1980s and 1990s. This tradition continued with the revived Jets team in 2011.

===Post-Jets era (1996–2004)===

Financial troubles forced the Jets to leave Winnipeg in 1996. It was a big blow for the city, but the arena was not without a tenant for long, as the Manitoba Moose of the International Hockey League moved in the next season. Renovations once again took place, with the addition of club seats and a new club lounge in place of the North End ice level seats. The Moose would be the arena&#x27;s last tenant.

The arena found itself back in the international spotlight when it hosted the 1999 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships. The tournament was a major success, setting a new attendance record, with 170,000 fans taking in the games. With the support of lively crowds reminiscent of the former Jets days, the host Canadian team advanced to the gold medal game, but lost to Russia in overtime.

===Other uses===

Aside from hockey, the Winnipeg Arena was often used for basketball, including home games for the Winnipeg Thunder, an independent professional team in the early 1990s; the inaugural Naismith Cup between the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies on October 21, 1995; and 1999 Pan American Games basketball and volleyball tournaments. In preparation for the Games, the portrait of the Queen was removed to make room for banners. It was placed in storage and never returned to the rafters. The arena also played host to charity fundraising hockey games such as Schmockey Night as well as figure skating events like Stars On Ice, Ice Capades, and Disney on Ice. The local Shiners Khartoum Temple also hosted the annual Shrine Circus there. 

The arena was also a frequent concert venue and a stop for professional wrestling tours such as the American Wrestling Association and WWE. In television and film, the arena was used for the made-for-television documentary &quot;Inside the Osmonds&quot; and the ESPN film &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot;. The arena, along with its multiple hockey tenants, was a major plot point in director Guy Maddin&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;My Winnipeg&quot;. 
==Demolition==
The opening of the privately owned MTS Centre, now known as Canada Life Centre, in 2004 meant the end for the Winnipeg Arena. The arena&#x27;s last official event was an American Hockey League game between the Manitoba Moose and Utah Grizzlies played before a capacity crowd on November 4, 2004. Several former Jets players, including Bobby Hull and Teemu Selänne, were present for a special ceremony as the banners hanging from the rafters were lowered before the game. Most of the memorabilia from the arena including the seats and the trough from the men&#x27;s washroom were auctioned off to the public prior to the demolition.
The Winnipeg Arena sat vacant until 2006, at which time the City of Winnipeg took on the $1.45 million expense of demolishing the arena. After the building was gutted, final demolition took place on March 26, 2006. On that morning, hundreds of hockey fans gathered to watch the building fall, while chanting, &quot;Go Jets, Go!&quot; However, the planned implosion failed to bring down the entire structure; construction vehicles later pulled down the remainder. The vacant site was purchased by the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan for $3.6 million and used as a parking lot for Canad Inns Stadium across the street until construction of new retail and office space began in 2011. The new complex, known as Polo Park North, opened in 2013.

<doc id="771113" wikidata="Q1535796" url="?curid=771113" title="Yale Bowl">
<text>The Yale Bowl Stadium is a college football stadium in the northeast United States, located in New Haven, Connecticut, on the border of West Haven, about 1½ miles (2½ km) west of the main campus of Yale University. The home of the Yale Bulldogs of the Ivy League, it opened in 1914 with 70,896 seats; renovations have reduced its current capacity to 61,446, still making it the second largest FCS stadium, behind Tennessee State&#x27;s Nissan Stadium.

The Yale Bowl inspired the design and naming of the Rose Bowl, from which is derived the name of college football&#x27;s post-season games (bowl games) and the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl.

In 1973 and 1974, the stadium hosted the New York Giants of the National Football League, as Yankee Stadium was renovated into a baseball-only venue. The Giants shared Shea Stadium in 1975 with the Jets and baseball Mets, then moved into new Giants Stadium in 1976.

== History ==

Ground was broken on the stadium in August 1913. Fill excavated from the field area was used to build up a berm around the perimeter to create an elliptical bowl. The facade was designed to partially echo the campus&#x27;s Neo-Gothic design, and, as with some central campus buildings, acid was applied to imitate the effects of aging.

It was the first bowl-shaped stadium in the country, and inspired the design of such stadiums as the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and Michigan Stadium. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its role in football history.

The Yale Bowl&#x27;s designer, Charles A. Ferry, for unknown reasons chose not to include locker rooms Players dress in the Smilow Field Center and walk to the field. When the NFL&#x27;s Giants played at the stadium (1973, 1974), the pro players disliked the arrangement, but Yale players reportedly enjoy the walk. Fans cheer for the team as it marches to the stadium while the Yale Band plays, a tradition known as the &quot;Bulldog Walk.&quot;

The Bowl&#x27;s first game, on November 21, 1914, drew more than 68,000 spectators, who watched the Bulldogs lose 36–0 to rival Harvard.

In 1958, a new scoreboard was installed; its distinctive clock was arranged vertically instead of horizontally.

During the 1970s, the Bowl hosted several concerts. In 1971, Yes performed on July 24 and the Grateful Dead on July 31, a recording of which was released as Road Trips Volume 1 Number 3. But neighborhood opposition to the concerts brought them to an end after a June 14, 1980, show featuring the Eagles, Heart, and The Little River Band. A picture from the show was published with the vinyl edition of the Eagles double live album, issued later that year, though no recordings from the event are included on the discs. A Paul McCartney concert was scheduled for June 1990, but cancelled amid neighbors&#x27; opposition; the show was moved to Chicago.

The stadium has hosted many soccer matches over the years; it served as home field for the Connecticut Bicentennials of the North American Soccer League during the 1976 and 1977 seasons. Yale Bowl was mulled as a possible playing site when the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994, but lost out to Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts and Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

In 1991, the Bowl&#x27;s vicinity saw the addition of the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center, home to the annual ATP/WTA event (the Pilot Pen tournament), across Yale Avenue from the stadium.

On October 5, 2001, the closing ceremony of the Yale Tercentennial was held at the Yale Bowl. Guests included Tom Wolfe &#x27;57, William F. Buckley &#x27;50, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s Big Bird, Paul Simon &#x27;96 Hon, and Garry Trudeau &#x27;70.

By the 21st century, many of the outside retaining walls and portal entries were deteriorating. In the spring and summer of 2006, the bowl received a partial renovation, including a new scoreboard. The work was completed just in time for the first home game of the Yale football team&#x27;s season on September 16.

The annual game between Yale and its rival Harvard, known locally as The Game, is held at the Yale Bowl every other year. In 2023, its attendance was over 51,000.

===Football===
====NFL====
The New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) won just one of the dozen home games they played in New Haven in the 1973 and 1974 seasons. (With the exception of the games played with replacement teams during the 1987 NFL strike and the COVID-19-disrupted 2020 season, the attendance at the final game at the Yale Bowl is the smallest at a Giants&#x27; home game since 1955.) The team also played preseason games in the stadium, including the first-ever game against future rival and stadium share partner, the defending Super Bowl champion New York Jets, a Sunday afternoon sellout in mid-August 1969.

===Soccer===
====International====
====NASL (1976–1977)====
The Connecticut Bicentennials of the NASL played two seasons at the Yale Bowl, mostly in front of dismal crowds. Even their highest-ever home attendance, against the New York Cosmos in 1977, drew only 17,302 fans, leaving the stadium more than three-quarters empty. However, the Bi&#x27;s could only draw a &quot;total&quot; of 57,438—less than the Bowl&#x27;s capacity for a single game—in their other 21 home games &quot;combined&quot;, an average of only 2,735 per contest. After the 1977 season, the club relocated to become the Oakland Stompers.

<doc id="771114" wikidata="Q712180" url="?curid=771114" title="Wilford Brimley">
<text>Anthony Wilford Brimley (September 27, 1934 – August 1, 2020) was an American actor. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps and working odd jobs in the 1950s, Brimley started working as an extra and stuntman in Western films in the late 1960s. He became an established character actor in the 1970s and 1980s in films such as &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983), &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), and &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985). Brimley was known for playing characters at times much older than his age. He was the long-term face of American television advertisements for the Quaker Oats Company. He also promoted diabetes education and appeared in related television commercials for Liberty Medical, a role for which he became an Internet meme.

== Early life ==
Anthony Wilford Brimley was born in Salt Lake City on September 27, 1934, the son of Lola (née Nelson) and real estate broker Wilford Brimley. His paternal grandfather was an Englishman from Wigan, while his paternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were a Scottish couple from Glasgow. His mother was half Danish and also had English, German, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry. Prior to a career in acting, he dropped out of high school at age 14 and worked as a cowboy in Arizona, Idaho, and Nevada.

Brimley joined the Marines in 1953 and served in the Aleutian Islands for three years. He also worked as a bodyguard for businessman Howard Hughes as well as a ranch hand, wrangler, and blacksmith. He then began shoeing horses for film and television. At the behest of his close friend and fellow actor Robert Duvall, he began acting in the 1960s as a riding extra and stunt man in westerns. In 1979, he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the most he ever earned in a year as an actor was $20,000. He had no formal training as an actor, and his first experience in acting in front of a live audience was in a theater group at the Los Angeles Actors&#x27; Theater.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===

Brimley&#x27;s onscreen breakthrough came when he was cast in the popular 1970s television series &quot;The Waltons&quot; as Walton&#x27;s Mountain resident and blacksmith Horace Brimley; he made seven appearances between 1974 and 1977.

His first credited feature film performance was in &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979) as Ted Spindler, a friend and coworker of plant shift supervisor Jack Godell (portrayed by Jack Lemmon). That same year, he appeared in the Robert Redford/Jane Fonda feature film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot; cast as simply &quot;The Farmer&quot; while assisting Redford and Fonda&#x27;s characters evade troopers while transporting the horse in a cattle hauler. Later, Brimley made a brief but pivotal appearance in &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; (1981) as the curmudgeonly, outspoken Assistant Attorney General James A. Wells. In the movie &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982) he played the role of Blair, a biologist among a group of men at an American research station in Antarctica who encounter a dangerous alien that can perfectly imitate other organisms.

Brimley&#x27;s close friend Robert Duvall (who also appeared in &quot;The Natural&quot;) was instrumental in securing for him the role of Harry in &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983). Duvall, who had not been getting along with director Bruce Beresford, wanted &quot;somebody down here that&#x27;s on my side, somebody that I can relate to.&quot; Beresford felt Brimley was too old for the part but eventually agreed to the casting. Brimley, like Duvall, clashed with the director; during one instance when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding: &quot;Now look, let me tell you something, I&#x27;m Harry. Harry&#x27;s not over there, Harry&#x27;s not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I&#x27;m Harry, and whatever I do is fine &#x27;cause I&#x27;m Harry.&quot;

Brimley then appeared as Pop Fisher, world-weary manager of a slumping baseball team, in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984). Brimley appeared in the 1984 film &quot;Country&quot; as Otis, the patriarch of a family farm, which took a sobering look at farms in crisis in the 1980s. Shortly thereafter, Brimley secured his first leading role in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), portraying Ben Luckett, leader of a group of geriatrics who encounter a magically reinvigorating swimming pool by their retirement home. Brimley was only 49 when he was cast in the role, and turned 50 during filming; he was at least 20 years younger than any of the actors playing the other retirement home residents. In order to look the part, Brimley bleached his hair and moustache to turn them gray, and had wrinkles and liver spots drawn on his face. He also starred in &quot;&quot;, a 1988 sequel.

Through these and other roles, Brimley became widely known for portraying gruff or stodgy old men, most notably on the 1980s NBC drama series &quot;Our House,&quot; also starring Deidre Hall, Chad Allen, and Shannen Doherty. One exception was when he played William Devasher, sinister head of security for a Mafia-associated law firm, in the Tom Cruise film &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993).

After portraying the father of Kevin Kline in &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), Brimley retreated from Hollywood in favor of involvement in more independent productions. He made an auspicious mainstream comeback with the TNT film &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot; (2001), co-starring with Tom Selleck (with whom he had previously worked in the films &quot;High Road to China&quot; and &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;). He played an intimidating United States Postmaster General in a 1997 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (&quot;The Junk Mail&quot;), who forces Kramer to end his boycott of the mail service. After several more years of independent film and TV acting, Brimley had a supporting role in &quot;Did You Hear About the Morgans?&quot; (2009), making witty exchanges with star Hugh Grant.

=== Commercials ===
Brimley frequently appeared in commercials, including a series of commercials for Quaker Oats, a campaign which became famous for his repeating their slogan &quot;It&#x27;s the right thing to do.&quot; Developed by advertising agency Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, the campaign began in 1987. Brimley appeared in numerous television advertisements for Liberty Medical, a company specializing in home delivery of medical products (including diabetes testing supplies). He appeared in commercials for the American Diabetes Association and was the voice-over for a Bryan Foods television commercial campaign.

==Musical interests==
Brimley has been described as &quot;a fine singer with a warm, rich voice&quot;. In 1993, Brimley sang with the Cal State Northridge Jazz Band for a concert benefiting the college&#x27;s Jazz Endowment Scholarship Fund. In 2004, he released &quot;This Time, The Dream&#x27;s On Me&quot;, an album of jazz standards named after the Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer-penned title track. He was also an accomplished harmonica player; during his 2011 appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,&quot; Brimley performed a lively rendition of &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; much to the delight, and surprise, of Ferguson and the studio audience. In 2013, Riders in the Sky partnered with Brimley to produce the album &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, which featured him singing a variety of country and folk songs.

== Personal life ==
Brimley was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was married to Lynne Bagley from July 6, 1956, until her death in June 2000. They had four sons together: James Charles, John Michael, William Carmen, and Lawrence Dean. He married Beverly Berry on October 31, 2007. They split their time between homes in Greybull, Wyoming, and Santa Clara, Utah. In 2009, they founded the nonprofit organization Hands Across the Saddle (HATS) in the Bighorn Basin.

Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1979, Brimley began working to raise awareness of the disease. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) honored him in 2008 with an award to recognize his lifetime of service. The ADA presented the award to him at the Port St. Lucie headquarters of Liberty Medical on December 19, 2008. He visited Veterans Administration hospitals and communities to advise patients on how to manage their diseases. His television advertisements for Liberty Medical became an Internet meme due to Brimley&#x27;s dialectal pronunciation of &quot;diabetes&quot;, often rendered as &quot;diabeetus&quot; (), contrasting with his overall serious tone.

Brimley spoke against the banning of cockfighting in New Mexico on the basis of his support of individual rights. He also spoke at a 1998 Phoenix rally opposing an Arizona ballot proposition to ban cockfighting, arguing that a ban could lead to efforts to restrict the use of hunting dogs, which opponents of cockfighting called a distraction from the issue. Brimley enjoyed playing poker and played in the World Series of Poker Main Event.

Brimley lent his support to John McCain in the 2008 United States presidential election. In the days leading up to his selection of a running mate, McCain jokingly stated that he would pick Brimley: &quot;He&#x27;s a former Marine and great guy and he&#x27;s older than I am, so that might work.&quot;

== Death ==
Brimley died at a hospital in St. George, Utah, on August 1, 2020, at age 85 after suffering from a kidney condition for two months.

<text>The Emba ( &quot;Embı&quot; or &quot;Jem&quot;, ) in west Kazakhstan rises in the Mugodzhar Hills and flows across the Sub-Ural Plateau and Caspian Depression into the Caspian Sea. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . It flows through the north of the Ust-Urt plateau, and reaches the Caspian by a series of shallow lagoons, which were navigable in the 18th century. The lower course traverses an area of salt domes and the petroleum-rich Emba fields. It is sometimes regarded as a definition for the natural boundary between Europe and Asia.

In its upper course, the Emba is a small river, its valley barely over wide. Lower down, after the waters of the Temir River flow into it, the Emba&#x27;s valleys widen to almost . The Emba flows in a single channel, only breaking off into little arms in places. But around before it enters the Caspian Sea, it breaks off in places to form several lakes, which are connected to each other through slender channels that only run during flooding. The Emba is a snow-fed river. It freezes over in winter, a process that begins in November and lasts until March.

==Oil basin==
The oil basin of the Emba lies between the Mugodzhar Hills in the east and the Volga in the west. This area was known since olden days as &quot;Maily Kiyan&quot;, which means the land blessed with miracle oil. The British merchant Gok mentioned in the mid-17th century that during his travels he came to a spring near the Emba River that spouted oil instead of water. Between 1919 and 1921 the Bolsheviks tried to build the Algemba railway and pipeline from Alexandrov Gay, so as to provide a means of conveying the oil from the recently captured oil field to the centre of Russia. However, due to logistical problems, the project failed with substantial loss of life.

<doc id="771131" wikidata="Q170613" url="?curid=771131" title="1992 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1992 Atlantic hurricane season was a significantly below average season for overall tropical or subtropical cyclones as only ten formed. Six of them became named tropical storms, and four of those became hurricanes; one hurricane became a major hurricane (Category 3 to 5 strength on the Saffir–Simpson scale). The season was, however, near-average in terms of accumulated cyclone energy. The season officially started on June 1 and officially ended on November 30. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by formation in April of an unnamed subtropical storm in the central Atlantic.

In June, Tropical Depression One caused flooding in Cuba and in Florida, where two people were killed. In August, Hurricane Andrew, the season&#x27;s only major hurricane, struck the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. It was the costliest Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, caused $27.3 billion (1992 USD) in damage; it also caused as 65 fatalities. Its greatest impact was in South Florida, where the storm made landfall with 1-minute sustained winds of .

One month later, Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley produced tropical storm-force winds in the Azores, and the former caused one fatality. Tropical Storm Danielle was one of few tropical cyclones known to make landfall on the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm caused minor damage and two fatalities in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. One other hurricane in the season, Frances, did not significantly affect land. It developed in the central Atlantic, and tracked well away from land, and brought only light rainfall to Newfoundland. Collectively, the storms in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season caused $27.3 billion in losses and 73 fatalities.

==Seasonal forecasts==
===Pre-season forecasts===

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. In December 1991, CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. CSU also issued a forecast in April, June and August; however, no revisions were made to the numbers of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricane predicted in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;8/92CSU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the season starting, the WRC predicted that the season would see six named storms, with three of those becoming a hurricane while no forecast was made on the numbers of major hurricanes.
== Season summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, but activity in 1992 began more than a month earlier with the formation of Subtropical Storm One on April 21. It was a below average season in which 10 tropical or subtropical depressions formed. Seven of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and four of these attained hurricane status. In addition, one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status, which is below the 1981–2010 average of 2.7 per season. The low amount of activity is partially attributed to weaker than normal tropical waves, the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones. Only two hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season. However, damage from Hurricane Andrew was astronomical, causing most of the season&#x27;s 73 deaths and $27.3 billion (1992 USD) damage toll.

Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Subtropical Storm One on April 21. However, over the next three months, minimal activity occurred, with only two depressions developing, one in June and the other in July. Although wind shear was relatively weak in August, only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month. However, that one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Andrew, was the strongest and costliest of the season. Though September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, an increase in wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis in the first half of the month. After September 16, however, five tropical cyclones developed in a span of nine days, from September 17 to 26. Thereafter, activity abruptly halted, and only one tropical cyclone developed in October, Hurricane Frances. By October 27, Frances became extratropical, ending season activity.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 76, which is classified as &quot;near normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==

=== Subtropical Storm One ===
On April 21, a low-pressure area separated from the prevailing westerlies about southeast of Bermuda, and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200 UTC. The system maintained a large comma-shaped cloud pattern around the low-level circulation. Operationally, it was not classified until 27 hours later. Isolated from strong steering currents, the depression tracked northwestward at , and intensified into a subtropical storm early on April 22. It gradually became better organized, with a large convective band in the eastern semicircle. Reports from a nearby ship indicated peak winds of , with swells of .

The National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for the system transitioning into a tropical cyclone. An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection. On April 23, the cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear. A hurricane hunter&#x27;s flight into the system confirmed the weakening, and also reported a 1.8 °F (1 °C) temperature rise in the center, suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics. Early on April 24, the subtropical depression turned eastward, maintaining limited convection. At the time, forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east-northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone. By late on April 24, the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique, and the NHC ceased issuing advisories. Within 24 hours, the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies.
=== Tropical Depression One ===
A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on June 12, and eventually developed into Tropical Depression One in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center designated this system as Tropical Depression Two, which led to confusion because of Subtropical Storm One in April, and then another Tropical Depression Two in July. Outflow from Hurricane Celia in the Pacific Ocean and a trough in the Gulf of Mexico generated wind shear on the depression, which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm. The depression curved north-northeastward and eventually made landfall near Tampa, Florida, on June 26 around 1500 UTC. As it was moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center noted that the depression was too poorly organized to locate the center of circulation, and discontinued advisories on the system.

The depression dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba, peaking at . Large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding, which damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities in provinces of Pinar del Río and La Habana. As the system was only a tropical depression, light winds were reported; however, a peak gust of was reported at MacDill Air Force Base. Heavy rainfall fell on the west coast of Florida, with local amounts exceeded . Precipitation throughout the state peaked at in Arcadia Tower. Heavy rainfall caused flooding in portions of Florida, which in turn, destroyed 70 houses. In addition, five homes destroyed and twelve were damaged by a tornado spawned in Nokomis. Severe crop damage to orange trees was also reported. The depression caused two fatalities in Florida and damage totaled to $2.6 million (1992 USD).
=== Tropical Depression Two ===

A squall line which moved offshore New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day as it moved within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics to the east of Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100 UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.

Due to northeasterly wind shear, the depression failed to intensified or organize further, as predicted. Instead, the depression weakened by late on July 25, with satellite imagery indicating that much of the deep convection was removed from the surface circulation. By July 26, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory, noting that it was &quot;too weak to classify and is rapidly losing its identity&quot;. The depression dissipated about three hours later.
=== Hurricane Andrew ===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14, and organized into Tropical Depression Three on August 16 while located about halfway between the Windward Islands and the coast of Africa. It moved to the west-northwest, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Andrew on August 17. After reaching winds of , strong southwesterly shear weakened the storm, and by August 20 it weakened to a minimal storm with a pressure of . It bypassed the Lesser Antilles completely, and turned to the west in response to a building high pressure system to the north. Upon turning to the west, a trough of low pressure positioned to the southwest of Andrew created an environment with little vertical shear and well-defined outflow. The storm quickly intensified due to its small size, and became a hurricane on August 22. Andrew rapidly intensified under ideal conditions for development, and on August 23 the hurricane peaked with winds of . It crossed the Bahamas at that intensity, weakened slightly, and re-intensified to a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall near Homestead, Florida. It weakened slightly over the state to a hurricane, but restrengthened to a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico. A strong mid-latitude trough turned Andrew northward, where it greatly weakened before hitting west of Morgan City, Louisiana on August 26 as a Category 3 hurricane. It turned northeastward, and lost its tropical identity over Tennessee on August 28, before merging with the remnants of Hurricane Lester and another frontal system over Pennsylvania on August 29.

In the Bahamas, Andrew brought high tides, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes, which caused significant damage in the archipelago, especially on Cat Cays. At least 800 houses were destroyed and left damage to the transport, communications, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Overall, Andrew caused four fatalities and $250 million in damage in the Bahamas. Throughout the southern portions of Florida, Andrew brought very high winds; a wind gust of was reported at a house in Perrine, Florida. High winds caused catastrophic damage in Florida, especially in Miami-Dade County, where approximately 117,000 houses were either severely damaged or destroyed. In the Everglades, 70,000 acres (280 km2) of trees were knocked down and about 182 million fish were killed. Rainfall in Florida was moderate, peaking at in western Miami-Dade County. Significant damage to oil platforms was reported, with one company losing 13 platforms, had 104 structures damaged, and five drilling wells blown off course. In Louisiana, Andrew produced hurricane-force winds along its path, damaging 23,000 homes and destroying 985 homes and 1,951 mobile homes. An F3 tornado in St. John the Baptist Parish damaged or destroyed 163 structures. 17 fatalities were reported in Louisiana, six of which were drowning victims offshore. Elsewhere, the storm spawned at least 28 tornadoes, especially in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Overall, Andrew caused 65 fatalities and $27.3 billion (1992 USD) in damage, making it the ninth-costliest hurricane in U.S. history, behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria in 2017, Hurricane Florence in 2018, Hurricane Ida in 2021, and Hurricane Ian in 2022 
===Hurricane Bonnie===
In mid-September, a tropical low detached from a cold front and developed into Tropical Depression Four late on September 17, while located about east-northeast of Bermuda. Early on the following day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie. Due to light vertical wind shear, Bonnie quickly strengthened, and became a hurricane late on September 18. Further deepening occurred, and at 1800 UTC on September 21, Bonnie peaked as a Category 2 hurricane. Thereafter, Bonnie became nearly stationary for almost 24 hours. Satellite images indicated that the low-level center became exposed, indicating that Bonnie was significantly weakening while tracking southward. It is estimated that Bonnie weakened to a tropical storm by late on September 24. Bonnie further deteriorated to tropical depression status on September 26, but re-strengthened to a tropical storm later that day.

By 1500 UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center declared Bonnie extratropical, since it was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100 UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.
=== Hurricane Charley ===

On September 20, METEOSAT imagery indicated an area of convection becoming concentrated while well south of the Azores. It is possible that a mid to upper-level cyclonic circulation interacted with the northern portion of a tropical wave. By the following day, satellite imagery noted a well-defined low-level circulation and thus, Tropical Depression Five while centered about south of the Azores. The depression tracked northwestward and satellite imagery began to indicate banding features. As a result, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley on September 22. An eye developed as Charley tracked north-northwestward, and it became a hurricane on September 23. Further strengthening occurred, and by late on September 24, Charley peaked as a Category 2 hurricane.

Thereafter, Charley turned eastward and then east-northeastward while tracking over decreasing sea surface temperatures (SST). Early on September 27, Charley was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, Charley crossed over Terceira Island in the Azores with winds of . Charley gradually lost tropical characteristics, and by 1800 UTC on September 27, it had transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnant system accelerated northeastward toward the British Isles, where it merged with another extratropical low on September 29. While passing through the Azores, Charley produced tropical storm force winds, with the Lajes AFB reporting sustained winds of and gusts reaching . No other effects from Charley were reported in the Azores.
=== Tropical Storm Danielle ===
Tropical Depression Six developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on September 22 from the merger of a surface trough, a tropical wave, and a cold front. The depression quickly intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle six hours later. An approaching trough caused a northeastward movement, but later a high pressure system forced the storm to northwestward, which caused Danielle to execute a small anti-cyclonic loop on September 23–24. While offshore of North Carolina on September 25, Danielle reached its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of . It was initially predicted that Danielle would make landfall in North Carolina; however, the storm curved north-northwestward and made landfall in Maryland on the eastern shore of the Delmarva Peninsula at the same intensity. Danielle continued inland and weakened and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.

Danielle caused severe beach erosion in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, which resulted in overwash, which in turn, damaged or destroyed several businesses and houses in the coastal portions of the three states. In addition, street flooding also closed several roads in the region, most notably, North Carolina Highway 12. Many states in the Mid-Atlantic and New England also reported rainfall, although rarely exceeding . In addition high seas offshore of New Jersey capsized a sailboat, causing two people to drown. Overall, damage from the storm was minimal, with the exception of the damaged or destroyed businesses and houses in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.
=== Tropical Depression Seven ===

A poorly organized tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 23 and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Seven on September 25, while centered southwest of Cape Verde. Because the depression was tracking over warm SST, it was predicted to intensify into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center as indicated by visible satellite images on September 26, and the National Hurricane Center noted on September 26 that &quot;the depression could be downgraded to a tropical wave later today&quot;. Early on September 27, the center of the depression became difficult to locate on satellite imagery.

By September 28, the organization of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over the depression within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center of the depression again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.
=== Tropical Storm Earl ===

On September 26, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight while centered about north of Hispaniola. The depression tracked west-northwestward toward the Bahamas. Initially, the depression remained weak, but after reaching the Gulf Stream it strengthened into Tropical Storm Earl at 1200 UTC on September 29. Around that time, Earl began to veer east, lessening the threat to Florida. Early on October 1, Earl reached maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . It gradually weakened thereafter, and Earl was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 3. Later that day, Earl became extratropical about south of Bermuda.

The threat from Earl prompted a tropical storm watch in the Bahamas and later Bermuda, while a coastal flood watch was issued in Florida. Because Earl remained offshore, impact was generally minor. Throughout Florida, Earl spawned 11 tornadoes and brought moderately heavy rainfall, peaking at near Canal Point, Florida. In addition, light amounts of precipitation were also reported in Georgia and North Carolina. Above normal tides washed away of beaches, and lifeguards on St. Augustine Beach made eight rescues.
=== Hurricane Frances ===

A low pressure area developed along the end of a quasi-stationary frontal trough. Initially, vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on the western portion of the system. After wind shear decreased, the system became a gale center late on October 22. By early on the following day, the gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm, and it is estimated that Tropical Storm Frances developed at 0600 UTC on October 23. Frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm, and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800 UTC on that same day. After becoming a hurricane, Frances curved northeastward, and remained well east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, Frances peaked as an 85 mph (140 km/h) Category 1 hurricane.

After reaching peak intensity, Frances began tracking over cooler sea surface temperatures, which gradually weakened the storm. The eye featured became indistinct and by late on October 25, Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm. Over the next two days, Frances began losing tropical characteristics, and was declared extratropical by early on October 27. One sailor was reported missing; however, it is unknown if it was as a result of Frances. In addition, one person on a sailboat suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances. On land, Frances caused minimal impact, limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1992. This is the same naming list used for the 1986 season.

=== Retirement ===

In the spring of 1993, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Andrew&quot; from its rotating Atlantic hurricane name lists on account of its destructiveness. The name was replaced with &quot;Alex&quot; the 1998 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the tropical and subtropical storms that formed in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1992 USD.

<doc id="771133" wikidata="Q4705979" url="?curid=771133" title="Alamo Stadium">
<text>Alamo Stadium is a horseshoe-shaped football and soccer stadium in the Monte Vista Historic District of San Antonio, Texas. Nicknamed &quot;The Rock Pile&quot; due to its primarily limestone construction it was completed in September 1940 as a Works Progress Administration project. The stadium is currently owned and operated by the San Antonio Independent School District as a high school football and soccer facility. It has a seating capacity of 18,500, making it the 3rd largest high school stadium in the state of Texas.

Soccer club Corinthians FC of San Antonio were tenants.

==History==

===Early years===
Initially proposed by SAISD trustees in May 1939, the stadium was constructed on the site of an abandoned rock quarry at a total cost of just under $500,000. The majority of funding was provided by the federal Works Progress Administration (project 65-1-66-30), with approximately $110,000 coming from district revenue bonds.

24,000 people were in attendance for the stadium&#x27;s opening celebration, a high school football doubleheader on September 20, 1940. Corpus Christi defeated Jefferson in the first game 14-0. Brackenridge defeated (Houston) Reagan 19-2 in the second.

===Modern day===
The stadium is currently used by the high schools of the SAISD, including Brackenridge, Burbank, Edison, Fox Tech, Highlands, Sam Houston, Jefferson, and Lanier High Schools for mainly high school football games. It is also home to track meets hosted by SAISD, also home to the Region IV-4A &amp; Region IV-5A track meets which occur in late April or early May. The Battle of the Bands is held there annually during Fiesta.

The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 2011.

===Future===
In November 2010, San Antonio voters approved a $515 million bond which included $35 million for renovation of the stadium. Proposed updates include new bathrooms, plumbing, seating and repairs. Visitors in 2017 noticed improvements but questioned whether the noticeable improvements tallied $35M in value. A lack of adequate parking (particularly noticeable on the East side of the stadium) has been a recurring complaint, with no real options to expand given the surrounding area.

In January 2011, San Antonio Spurs owner SS&amp;E expressed an interest in bringing a professional soccer team to San Antonio, possibly playing in Alamo Stadium.

==Stadium usage==

===High school football===
The stadium has been home to numerous high school games, including the Chili Bowl, an annual football game between Fox Tech and Lanier high schools. It regularly sold out, and was consistently one of the highest attended regular season football games in Texas, averaging about 23,000 spectators. After the 2009 season, the Fox Tech football team was disbanded, ending the series.

In 2002, the stadium hosted the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.

===College football===
Alamo Stadium has also hosted college football games. When the stadium opened in 1940, two college football games were held at the newly constructed stadium, Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s defeat of Tulsa, 41–6, on October 5, and Baylor&#x27;s defeat of Villanova, 7–0, two weeks later, on October 19. The stadium was host to the Texas A&amp;M–Texas Tech football rivalry for eight consecutive games from 1943 through 1950. It was also the home of the first bowl game held in San Antonio, the 1947 Alamo Bowl between Hardin–Simmons and Denver. The game was a financial failure and a postseason bowl game would not return to San Antonio until the modern incarnation of the Alamo Bowl that began in 1993 and has since been held at the Alamodome.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Rattlers===
For the 1940 and 1941 college football seasons, the St. Mary&#x27;s Rattlers played their home games at Alamo Stadium. Their first game, and the first college football game, at the stadium was a 51-0 win against Daniel Baker College on September 26, 1940. The Rattlers final college football game was a 7-0 loss to Mississippi Southern.

===Professional football===
The stadium has been home to several professional football teams, including the San Antonio Wings of the WFL in 1975, the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL from 1984 to 1985, the San Antonio Riders of the WLAF in 1991, and the San Antonio Matadors of the Spring Football League in 2000.

===Soccer===
Alamo Stadium was the home of the San Antonio Thunder for 1976, their second of only two years in the city. The team was a member of the North American Soccer League and moved to Hawaii for the 1977 season.

<doc id="771135" wikidata="Q588463" url="?curid=771135" title="Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, 1st Count of Venadito">
<text>Juan José Ruiz de Apodaca y Eliza, 1st Count of Venadito, OIC, OSH, KOC (3 February 1754 – 11 January 1835) was a Spanish Navy officer, nobleman and colonial administrator who served as the viceroy of New Spain from 20 September 1816 to 5 July 1821 during the Mexican War of Independence.

==Military career==
Ruiz de Apodaca was born in Cádiz into a family of renowned Basque merchants. He began his military career on November 7, 1767 as part of the marine guard, and three years after he was named frigate lieutenant, being continuously promoted until reaching the rank of naval lieutenant on May 23, 1778. At this time he also married Maria Rosa Gaston with whom he had seven children. 

He sailed as a junior officer throughout the northern and the southern hemisphere on various ships. He was commissioned to go to Tahiti on the friguate &quot;Aguila&quot;, where he gathered much info about the area, drawing up charts of the island and its ports. He was promoted to frigate captain in 1781, and he was placed in charge of the &quot;Asuncion&quot;, joining the squadron led by Luis de Córdova y Córdova. Two years later he happened to be the commander who brought news of the end of the Anglo-French War to the Philippines, on the return trip to Spain taking silver and fruit. 

Upon his arrival in Cádiz, he gave a briefing on copper sheathing, and the Ministry of the Navy approved a project to apply to technique to many Spanish ships. It was this in part which led to his promotion to Captain on February 26, 1788, and shortly after to squadron major general under the command of lieutenant general Félix Ignacio de Tejada. He was tasked with repairs and improvements to the docks of Tarragona, a task which took ten years to complete. He also was tasked with informing the government of the progress of the improvements to the port of Alicante. 

In July 1803 he was again in charge of the Cartagena arsenal, where he had already held that position in 1797. On March 24, 1807 he was granted command of the Ocean squadron, surrendering the following year to the French squadron anchored in Cádiz, commanded by Admiral Rosily, in the Capture of the Rosily Squadron.

He was promoted to lieutenant general on 23 August 1809, and in January of the same year Apodaca had been sent to London to open peace negotiations and create an alliance to fight against the French invader (Treaty of London of 14 January 1809 ). He returned to Cadiz from his diplomatic mission in London. All this earned him singular displays of appreciation from the Government and the King of the United Kingdom, who gave him conspicuous signs of this when he left office on 15 June 1811. In February 1812 he went to Havana as captain general and governor of the island of Cuba. 

==As viceroy of New Spain==
During a moment of great turbulence in the Mexican war of independence, he was named viceroy of New Spain at the beginning of 1816 but he did not take over the office from Félix María Calleja del Rey until September 20. As a new viceroy Apodaca offered amnesty to the rebels. Thousands of insurgents accepted, with only Vicente Guerrero in the south and Guadalupe Victoria and Nicolás Bravo in Veracruz remaining in active rebellion. The viceroy also reversed the harsh policies of Calleja and ordered that in no circumstances were rebel prisoners to be summarily shot.

He banned the flying of kites (as a safety measure, because they were generally flown from rooftops). He closely reviewed the public accounts, finding that Calleja had kept them accurately and carefully. He paid off the public debt, stopped relying on loans to fund the government, and relied instead only on the customs duties, taxes and other fees due the government. He revived the commercial and mining sectors of the economy, insofar as that was possible in a time of war.

On April 17, 1817, Spanish liberal Francisco Javier Mina and 308 volunteers arrived at Soto la Marina, Nuevo Santander, from London and New Orleans. Mina issued a manifesto saying he was not fighting against Spain, but rather against the tyranny of King Ferdinand VII and to restore the constitutional regime. On May 24 his troops began a march into the interior to join with rebels under Pedro Moreno at Fuerte del Sombrero, northeast of Guanajuato. Apodaca sent a strong column against Mina and his allies, under the command of Field Marshal Pascual Liñán. After active fighting, Liñán killed Moreno and took Mina prisoner at the Rancho del Venadito, near Silao on October 27. Mina was executed by firing squad on November 11. As the result of this action, the viceroy received the title of &quot;Conde de Venadito&quot;, which provoked much ridicule. Once again it looked as though the insurrection might be over.

The United States and Britain, which after the Napoleonic Wars were no longer war-time allies of Spain, and France were all interested in the commercial advantages they would gain by supporting the rebels in the Spanish possessions. Spanish agents received news that Britons Thomas Cochrane and Wilson were preparing an expedition against New Spain, and that Mexican insurgents in New York had bought a gunboat, which they based in Matagorda Bay to attack coastal trading in the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, Apodaca was given instructions to redouble the vigilance on the coasts. The insurgents managed to capture an armed trading ship from Veracruz and executed the captain. American William Robinson managed to occupy Altamira and Tampico, hoping to give new impetus to the revolution, but Robinson was taken prisoner in Tampico and sent to Cádiz. He escaped to Gibraltar, with the assistance of the British. Later, Spain and the United States signed the Adams-Onís Treaty on February 22, 1819. The treaty established boundaries between the United States and New Spain, which had been in dispute since the Louisiana Purchase. The U.S. obtained Florida and renounced its claim to Texas. Spain renounced its claim to the Oregon Country.

The previous viceroy, Calleja, had established a fort in the old tobacco warehouse in Mexico City, named &quot;La Ciudadela&quot;. Apodaca converted it into a storehouse for arms and munitions, but these were slowly being pilfered. He ordered Brigadier Francisco Novella to take charge of La Ciudadela and stop the thievery. Novella considered that task beneath his dignity, and was able to enlist the support of the Audiencia. The incident made Novella an enemy of Ruiz de Apodaca, and it was Novella who later deposed and replaced him in 1821.

==The Plan de Iturbide==
On January 1, 1820, Colonel Rafael del Riego rose in rebellion in Andalusia, Spain, demanding the restoration of the Constitution of 1812. Ferdinand VII was forced to reinstate the constitution on March 9, 1820 in Spain and all of the Spanish possessions. When the order arrived in New Spain, Apodaca delayed its publication pending the outcome of secret negotiations being carried out in the church of La Profesa. On March 7, 1821, the negotiators agreed on a declaration of independence for New Spain, accompanied by an offer to Ferdinand VII to rule as an absolute monarch, without mention of a constitution.

For this plan to succeed, the support of the military was necessary. To that end, the viceroy chose General Agustín de Iturbide to represent the cabal, at the same time freeing him from a court case involving accusations of misbehavior at El Bajío. The plan, ironically as it turned out, became known as the &quot;Plan de Iturbide&quot;. Iturbide had been given command of royalist troops in the south of the country on November 9, 1820. In the meantime Apodaca instituted the Constitution of 1812 on May 31, 1820.

==The Plan de Iguala==
In pursuit of his own ambitions, Iturbide corresponded with and then met with the insurgent general he was sent to fight, Vicente Guerrero on February 10, 1821. The two of them agreed to declare the independence of Mexico. This agreement was announced March 2, 1821, in the town of Iguala in the present state of Guerrero.

This agreement became known as the &quot;Plan de Iguala&quot;. It invited Viceroy Ruiz de Apodaca to become leader of the independence movement. The viceroy rejected the offer, and declared Iturbide a traitor and an outlaw. He sent troops against him, but everywhere the troops rebelled and went over to Iturbide. Lieutenant Colonel Antonio López de Santa Anna, for example, endorsed the Plan de Iguala in Xalapa on May 29, 1821.

==The overthrow of Ruiz de Apodaca==
The royalists, led by Brigadier Buceli, declared Apodaca inept and deposed him on July 5, 1821. Apodaca was sent to Spain to face charges, but he was absolved and returned to duty. He was captain general of the Spanish navy at the time of his death in 1835.

The city of Apodaca in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, is named for him.

General Francisco Novella was made interim viceroy until the arrival of Ruiz de Apodaca&#x27;s replacement, Superior Political Chief Juan O&#x27;Donojú, a short time later. The 300-year rule of Mexico by Spain was nearly at an end.

<doc id="771138" wikidata="Q2873035" url="?curid=771138" title="Autostade">
<text>The Autostade (the English name Automotive Stadium was rarely used) was a Canadian football stadium in the Victoriatown neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec that stood at the north-west corner of the Cité du Havre sector of the Expo 67 site. It was the home of the CFL&#x27;s Montreal Alouettes from 1968 to 1976, except for a brief period in 1972 when the team returned to its previous home, Molson Stadium.

== Design and financing ==
The Autostade was built in preparation for the 1967 World&#x27;s Fair, Expo 67 as a venue for several events including the World Music Festival and the Rodeo Show. It was designed by architects Victor Prus and Maurice Desnoyers. With a seating capacity of 33,172, the stadium is best remembered for its odd shape: to allow the stadium to be dismantled and re-erected on a new site if required, the architects employed a segmental structural system comprising 19 independent but linked pre-cast concrete grandstands, each 40 seats wide, arranged around the central field.

The stadium was financed by donations from the five major auto manufacturers in Canada at the time: American Motors, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Volvo, hence its name.

== History ==
From the start, the new stadium was configured for CFL football use. The first CFL game played at the Autostade was the 1966 Eastern final between the Ottawa Rough Riders and Hamilton Tiger-Cats, held on November 19. The Rough Riders would have hosted the game, but Lansdowne Park was undergoing extensive renovations at the time. Ottawa won the game 42-16. This game also marked the first use of the single-shaft &quot;goose-necked&quot; field goal posts in the CFL (which has become the norm in professional football since; the NFL and NCAA later adopted those model goalposts the next year).

It was originally planned that Montreal&#x27;s new baseball team, the Montreal Expos, would play home games at the Autostade as well for at least their first two seasons. However, the city was unwilling to pay the cost of adding a dome, thought to be a must because of Montreal&#x27;s often bitterly cold springs and falls. The Alouettes demanded steep rent payments in order to let the Expos share the stadium. Even without these factors to consider, since the Autostade was owned by the federal government, there were some doubts that the city even had the authority to renovate it. Instead, the Expos opted to use Jarry Park.

Following its use in Expo 67, the gaps between the sections were filled in preparation for the Alouettes&#x27; 1968 season. However, the stadium was considered by many to be located too far from downtown (a complaint that would be echoed years later regarding Olympic Stadium) as well as too cold due to its proximity to the Saint Lawrence River. As a result, crowds declined rapidly. Despite this, those fans that did attend remember the stadium as having an intimate atmosphere well suited to CFL football.

The only Grey Cup contest at the Autostade was played on November 30, 1969, between the Ottawa Rough Riders and Saskatchewan Roughriders. Due to fears about FLQ terrorist activities, the CFL had 300 police officers in full riot gear on standby just in case anything got out of hand, but there were no incidents. Ottawa&#x27;s Russ Jackson and Frank Clair both ended their Hall of Fame careers with a 29-11 win over Saskatchewan. This game was featured in the 1969 movie &quot;Deux femmes en or&quot; and is chronicled in TSN&#x27;s 2012 documentary series of films &quot;Engraved on a Nation&quot;.

Crowds remained small for the next two seasons. The 1971 CFL All Star Game attracted little attention, and the Alouettes ownership decided to return to Molson Stadium in 1972, hoping to increase profitability. The plan backfired, with attendance below 15,000 a game, and the team returned to the Autostade the following year. The stadium fell into disuse after the Alouettes moved to Olympic Stadium following the 1976 Summer Olympics.

In 1978, the city of Thetford Mines paid $350,000 to acquire five of the 19 original bleacher sections, transport them to the city 143 miles (228 kilometers) northeast of Montreal, and reassemble them on the site of the city&#x27;s former minor league ballpark. The balance of the Autostade was demolished in 1979, but the reconstructed stadium (now known as Stade des Caisses Desjardins) has hosted amateur baseball and softball since construction was completed in 1980. In 2010, the Thetford Blue Sox, a semi-professional baseball team in the Ligue de Baseball Senior Élite du Québec began play in the stadium.

In May 2005, the Montreal Impact soccer club had announced that they would be building a new stadium near the former location of the Autostade (now a parking lot and transformer station). The Impact later changed their plans, and broke ground on a new stadium in Olympic Park in the spring of 2007 which opened as Saputo Stadium in 2008.

<text>BC Place is a multi-purpose stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Located at the north side of False Creek, it is owned and operated by the BC Pavilion Corporation (PavCo), a Crown corporation of the province.

The venue is currently the home of the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL), Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), the annual Canada Sevens (part of the World Rugby Sevens Series), as well as the BC Sports Hall of Fame.

Opened on June 19, 1983, BC Place was originally an indoor structure with an air-supported roof, the world&#x27;s largest at the time. Following the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was closed for 16 months as part of an extensive revitalization, the centrepiece of which was replacing the inflatable roof with a retractable roof supported by cables. Once construction was completed, the stadium&#x27;s new roof was also the largest of its type.

BC Place was the main stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics, the 2012 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournament, as well as a venue for multiple matches including the championship match for the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The stadium is set to host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including knockout stage matches.

==History==
===Opening and 20th century===

Construction of the stadium started in February of 1981, with Dillingham Construction contracted to build the stadium, designed by architecture firm Studio Phillips Barratt, Ltd. BC Place was built as part of the preparations for the 1986 World&#x27;s Fair, Expo 86. Upon its completion in 1983, the stadium, designed by structural engineers Geiger Berger Associates, was the world&#x27;s largest air-supported domed stadium until May 4, 2010, when it was deflated for the last time in preparation for the erection of its new retractable roof. Its original air-supported design was similar to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which later stored pieces of the roof for reuse.

The stadium held its grand opening on June 19, 1983. The first major event held in the stadium came the next day, June 20, when the Vancouver Whitecaps hosted the Seattle Sounders in a Monday night North American Soccer League (NASL) game with attendance announced at 60,342. On June 23, 1983, the BC Lions played their first game at the new stadium, a preseason 41–19 victory against the Calgary Stampeders with 53,472 in attendance. A month later, on July 24, 1983, a crowd of 41,810 watched the BC Lions defeat the Saskatchewan Roughriders 44–28 in the Lions&#x27; first regular season game at the stadium. The venue would host the Soccer Bowl &#x27;83 and the 1983 Grey Cup game later that year. On September 18, 1984, Pope John Paul II addressed an over-capacity crowd of 60,000 for &quot;A Celebration of Life&quot;. The celebration was part of the papal visit to the Archdiocese of Vancouver. It was one of the most heavily attended events in the stadium. The Pope&#x27;s Celebration of Life was followed a few months later by the Billy Graham Crusade, which drew similar numbers for eight nights.

The stadium was then used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1986 World Exposition on Transportation and Communication (Expo &#x27;86). Accepting an invitation by the Province of British Columbia, Prince Charles and Princess Diana presided over the opening ceremonies of the World&#x27;s Fair on May 2, 1986. In 1987, an exhibition match of Australian rules football was played at the stadium and drew a crowd of 32,789 a record for the largest AFL/VFL crowd outside of Australia. The stadium also hosted a National Football League exhibition game in 1998 when the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 24–21 in the American Bowl with 45,000 in attendance.

===2007 roof deflation===
On January 5, 2007, snow accumulated on the air-supported Teflon Fibreglass roof, despite strict zero accumulation of ice guidelines and ice accumulation structural warnings. The accumulation caused a tear in the roof&#x27;s ETFE-coated fabric close to Gate G on the south side where the roof meets the top of the concrete bowl. The tear grew quickly as air escaped through it, whereupon maintenance staff performed an intentional, controlled deflation to protect the integrity of the roof&#x27;s intact fabric panels. As it was designed to do, the deflated roof rested on its steel support cables 6 metres (20 ft) above the seating and the field. Normally, the roof had a rise of 27 metres (90 ft) above the top of the bowl when inflated. No one was injured during the incident, although rain and melted snow flooded the bowl and subsequently had to be pumped out.

An independent report indicated that an accidental rapid pressurization combined with lightly gusting wind and a location of previously undetected damage caused the tear. The damaged panel was replaced with a temporary one on January 19 and the roof was re-inflated. The BC Contractors Association held an exhibition in the stadium over the week of January 23, during which the roof leaked in several places when it rained. The temporary panel was successfully replaced with a permanent one in June 2007, just prior to the start of the 2007 CFL season.

===Renovation and roof replacement===
On May 16, 2008, it was announced that over $150 million in major renovations would be carried out on BC Place Stadium. The work was done in two phases. The first phase involved upgrades to seating, washrooms, concessions, and luxury suites, as well as the reinforcement of the existing ring beam at the top of the building and was completed in October 2009, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Work on the retractable roof began in May 2010, with PCL Westcoast Constructors Inc. contracted to construct the roof designed by architecture firm Stantec Architecture Ltd. and structural engineering firm Geiger Engineers, with Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner serving as consulting engineers and Genivar, Inc. acting as services engineers. Geiger also designed the stadium&#x27;s new centre-hung scoreboard. The roof&#x27;s construction began immediately after the completion of the 2010 Winter Paralympics and the final deflation of the air-supported roof. The official budget for the completed Phase 1 upgrades plus the revitalization project was $514 million. The new roof, a cable-supported retractable roof system first used with the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, is the largest of its kind. The opening measures , the same size as the field below. The fabric roof retracts into and is hidden by a pod in the centre of the opening, above the suspended videoboard.

The updated stadium also features the second largest centre-hung high definition scoreboard in North America, after the one in AT&amp;T Stadium. In addition, a new artificial turf developed by Polytan was installed at an estimated cost of $1.2 million. It is designed to achieve FIFA 2-star certification, the highest rating possible. The soccer pitch is .

TSN analyst and former CFL player Chris Schultz praised both the design and engineering of the new stadium. Columnist Brian Hutchinson has praised the renovations for significantly improving the acoustics, and providing a bright and airy feel to the stadium. These were aspects that were missing in its previous air-supported roof incarnation, as well as the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Rogers Centre (formerly SkyDome).

The artificial turf installed between September 2011 and April 2015 drew criticism, notably its lacklustre characteristics for playing professional level soccer. A new artificial turf was installed in May 2015, prior to the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Canada 2015. The total cost of the turf upgrade was $1.327 million, with Canada Soccer and Rugby Canada contributing $500,000 CDN to the project. Liam Middleton, Canada&#x27;s Rugby Sevens coach, stated that the new surface was &quot;better than some natural grass surfaces they&#x27;ve played on.&quot;

====Summary of renovations====

===Post-renovation===

The opening and closing ceremonies of the XXI Olympic Winter Games and the opening ceremonies of the X Paralympic Winter Games were also held in BC Place Stadium in February and March 2010, respectively. The stadium was the first air-supported structure and 24th venue to host the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. It was also both the third CFL venue and the third Canadian venue to have served as an Olympic Stadium, after Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium and Calgary&#x27;s McMahon Stadium.

The 47th Vanier Cup was the first Canadian university football championship paired with the Grey Cup Festival and played on November 25, 2011, between the McMaster Marauders and Laval Rouge et Or in front of 24,935. Nicknamed &quot;Best Game... Ever&quot;, it is widely regarded as one of the most exciting Canadian Football games of all time with McMaster winning 41–38 in double overtime. It was the first championship played in the newly renovated facility.

The 2012 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournament final between the United States and Canada played at the stadium was the highest attendance for a women&#x27;s CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying game with 25,427 people in attendance.

The 2014 NHL Heritage Classic took place March 2, 2014, in BC Place, with the Ottawa Senators facing off against the home team Vancouver Canucks. It was the first NHL game to be played in a retractable roof stadium.

BC Place hosted its second major international sports competition, the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Five group stage matches, two round of 16 matches, and one quarter-final were held in the stadium during June 2015, and the Final between Japan and the United States was played here on July 5, 2015. The Canada women&#x27;s national team played Australia at BC Place on December 5, 2023, as part of a farewell tour for Christine Sinclair. The stadium was temporarily renamed to Christine Sinclair Place in her honor.

The stadium hosted round six of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2015–16 series.

A new overall attendance record was set on September 2, 2023, with 65,061 people attending an Ed Sheeran concert, surpassing the previous record of 63,803 set by a U2 concert in 2009. On December 6, 7, and 8, 2024, BC Place hosted the final three shows of Taylor Swift&#x27;s The Eras Tour.

==Tenants==
BC Place&#x27;s main sports tenants are the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Vancouver Nighthawks, a member of the World Basketball League, played the 1988 season at BC Place.

===Canadian football===

The Lions have played at BC Place since it opened in 1983 and had a record attendance of 59,478 for three games in 1985 and 1986. When it was built, the floor of BC Place was too small to accommodate a full-sized CFL regulation field, as a result BC Place became the first CFL stadium to use a 20-yard end zone instead of the regulation 25-yard end zone then in use. Although controversial at first, the smaller end zone proved highly popular with players and was adopted league-wide in 1986.

The stadium has hosted the CFL&#x27;s championship game, the Grey Cup, ten times: in 1983, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1994, 1999, 2005, 2011, 2014, and 2024. Notable was the 1994 championship, in which the hometown BC Lions defeated the U.S. expansion team the Baltimore Football Club on a last-second field goal by Lui Passaglia, preventing the Grey Cup trophy from leaving Canada (Baltimore would win the Grey Cup the following year). The stadium hosted the 99th Grey Cup in 2011 after the new roof was completed (this Grey Cup game was also won by the BC Lions at home).

===Soccer===

Several incarnations of the Whitecaps have played at BC Place. The original Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League (NASL) played at the stadium from 1983 to 1984, when the team folded. The team hosted the first sporting event at BC Place, a regular season match against the Seattle Sounders on June 20, 1983, which drew 60,342 spectators. Soccer Bowl &#x27;83 was also held at BC Place, where the Tulsa Roughnecks defeated the Toronto Blizzard 2–0 in front of 53,326 spectators.

The stadium was also used for exhibition matches as well as Canada national team fixtures during the 1980s and 1990s. The second incarnation of the Whitecaps, initially named the Vancouver 86ers, played exhibition matches at BC Place in 1991 and 1992 before returning for regular season games in 1995 during renovations to Swangard Stadium. On November 7, 2007, the Whitecaps hosted the LA Galaxy for an exhibition match that drew 48,172 spectators—mainly attracted by the appearance of David Beckham.

On August 21, 2021, the Whitecaps played their first home game at BC Place since the COVID-19 pandemic after being forced to stay in the United States for the 2020 season and the first half of the 2021 season. They won 2–1 against Los Angeles FC. 

After the Whitecaps joined MLS and moved into the renovated BC Place, the team only sold seats in the lower bowl. They drew a record of 27,683 spectators for a regular season match against Seattle Sounders FC in 2018 without opening the upper bowl. The restriction was lifted for a 2023 playoff match against Los Angeles FC on November 5, 2023; the match had 30,204 spectators. The team set their new MLS attendance record on May 25, 2024, with 51,035 spectators during a regular season match against Inter Miami CF who had signed soccer legend Lionel Messi the year prior.

====2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup====

====2026 FIFA World Cup====
BC Place will host seven matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup as one of two Canadian venues alongside BMO Field in Toronto. Among them are five group stage matches, including two home games for the Canada national team on June 18 and 24, and two knockout stage matches: one in the round of 32 and another in the round of 16. The provincial government estimates that it will cost $240–260 million to stage, plan, and host the matches at BC Place.

===Baseball===
BC Place can also be used in a baseball configuration to attract a future Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It can accommodate a baseball diamond with retractable seating sections making room for right field. The Vancouver Canadians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League played several series of games there between 1984 and 1988, including games 1 and 2 of the 1985 league championship series. Numerous MLB spring training games were also played, including in 1984 (Toronto Blue Jays and Milwaukee Brewers), 1986 (Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Montreal Expos and Seattle Mariners), 1993 (Toronto, Seattle, Milwaukee and Detroit Tigers) and 1994 MLB season (Toronto, Seattle, Montreal and Colorado Rockies). The Mariners explored plans to play regular season games at BC Place in the mid-1990s, but were unable to receive approval from MLB.

In the mid-1990s, the stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be named Vancouver team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third league of MLB; it never came to fruition.

==Transportation==
The stadium is served by two SkyTrain stations on two lines: the Expo Line (TransLink)&#x27;s Stadium–Chinatown to the East, and the Canada Line&#x27;s Yaletown–Roundhouse to the west. TransLink also operates several bus routes that stop near BC Place. The False Creek Ferries and Aquabus also serve the stadium, docking at the nearby Plaza of Nations.

<text>Black Comedy is a one-act farce by Peter Shaffer, first performed in 1965. The premise of the piece is that light and dark are transposed, so that when the stage is lit the cast are supposed to be in darkness and only when the stage is dark are they supposed to be able to see each other and their surroundings. 

In the play, a young sculptor and his fiancée have borrowed some expensive antique furniture from a neighbour&#x27;s flat without his permission to impress an elderly millionaire art collector. When the power fails, the neighbour returns early, other people also arrive unexpectedly, and matters descend into near-chaos.

==Background and first production==
In the early spring of 1965, Kenneth Tynan, dramaturge of the National Theatre, commissioned Shaffer to write a one-act play to accompany a production of &quot;Miss Julie&quot; starring Maggie Smith and Albert Finney. Shaffer later wrote in the introduction to his 1982 Collected Plays:
Shaffer set about composing the play. To produce a more sustaining dramatic premise than the mere gimmick of inverse lighting, Shaffer devised the notion that one of the characters had a reason to actually &quot;keep&quot; the others in the dark. It was from this necessity that the idea of the stolen furniture was conceived, and the theme of lies was solidified. Brindsley would keep his guests in the dark – both figuratively and literally.

Tynan later said of the rehearsal process, &quot;This was farce rehearsed in farce conditions.&quot; Owing to scheduling difficulties at Chichester, &quot;Black Comedy&quot; was given very little rehearsal time, and it opened without a single public preview. The play was directed by John Dexter – who had directed Shaffer&#x27;s previous play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, and later directed &quot;Equus&quot; – with what Shaffer called &quot;blazing precision.&quot; He added that &quot;it was acted with unmatchable brio by Smith and Finney, by Derek Jacobi as an incomparable Brindsley, and by Graham Crowden as a savagely lunatic Colonel Melkett&quot;. 
Smith had previously starred in two of Shaffer&#x27;s previous plays, &quot;The Private Ear&quot; and &quot;The Public Eye&quot;, which were performed as a double bill at the Globe Theatre.

The play is written to be staged under a reversed lighting scheme: the play opens on a darkened stage. A few minutes into the action there is a short circuit, and the stage is illuminated to reveal the characters in a &quot;blackout&quot;. On the few occasions when matches, lighters, or torches are lit, the lights grow dimmer.

&quot;Black Comedy&quot; was first presented at the Chichester Festival Theatre by the National Theatre on 27 July 1965, and subsequently at the Old Vic, London, directed by Dexter with the following cast:
*Brindsley Miller – Derek Jacobi
*Carol Melkett – Louise Purnell
*Miss Furnival – Doris Hare
*Colonel Melkett – Graham Crowden
*Harold Gorringe – Albert Finney
*Schuppanzigh – Paul Curran
*Clea – Maggie Smith
*Georg Bamberger – Michael Byrne

==Synopsis==
The play begins in complete darkness.

Brindsley Miller, a young sculptor, and his debutante fiancée, Carol Melkett, have stolen some expensive antiques from his neighbour Harold Gorringe, who is away for the weekend, to spruce up Brindsley&#x27;s apartment to impress Carol&#x27;s father and a wealthy prospective art buyer named Georg Bamberger. Before the guests arrive, a fuse in the cellar short-circuits, causing a blackout. The stage is instantly illuminated.

As Brindsley and Carol search for matches, the phone rings and Brindsley answers. It is his former mistress Clea, who has just returned from Finland. Brindsley distracts Carol and refuses to see Clea.

Miss Furnival, the occupant of the flat upstairs, enters seeking refuge from her fear of the dark. Miss Furnival is a spinster and lifelong teetotaller. They ring the London Electricity Board, but are told only that an electrician might arrive some time later that night.

Carol&#x27;s father, Colonel Melkett, arrives. He takes an almost instant dislike to Brindsley and is unimpressed with one of his sculptures – a large work in iron with two prongs.

Harold Gorringe returns from his weekend early. Brindsley quickly pulls Harold into the flat so that he will not go into his own and discover the thievery. In the dark, Harold does not realise that the room is full of his own things. As Carol blindly mixes everyone drinks, Brindsley attempts to silently restore as much of the stolen furniture to Harold&#x27;s flat as possible.

There is a mix-up as Carol hands out the drinks in the dark, and Miss Furnival is given liquor by mistake. She is hooked after her first taste, and stealthily procures more. Harold discovers Brindsley and Carol&#x27;s engagement, and is furious at the news. It is obvious that he himself has secret feelings for Brindsley. (It is also implied that Brindsley might also be having an affair with Harold.)

Clea enters unannounced. In the confusion, Brindsley catches hold of her bottom, and instantly recognises it. He manages to retreat with her to the loft, where his desperate pleas that she leave dissolve into passionate kisses. When she refuses to go, he concedes that she can stay in the loft, if she will not come downstairs.

The electrician, a German named Schuppanzigh, arrives to mend the fuse, and everyone excitedly mistakes him for Bamberger. The electrician, with his lit torch, catches sight of the sculpture, and is extremely impressed. Schuppanzigh, who was highly educated in art at Heidelberg, praises Brindsley&#x27;s work with great eloquence. Just as the statue seems on the verge of being sold for five hundred guineas, they realise who he really is. The group turns on him in indignation, and Schuppanzigh is cast down to the cellar to mend the fuse.

Clea emerges from the loft and discovers Brindsley&#x27;s engagement. Outraged, she dashes vodka over the startled guests. When Clea reveals herself, Carol is horrified, but is interrupted by Miss Furnival who, completely inebriated, erupts into a drunken tirade, ranting on the terrors of the modern supermarket, calling to her dead father, and prophesying a judgement day when &quot;the heathens in their leather jackets&quot; will be &quot;stricken from their motorcycles.&quot; She is led out by a consoling Harold. Carol breaks off the engagement and the Colonel is livid.

When Harold discovers the state of his room, he returns to Brindsley&#x27;s flat mad with fury. He pulls one of the metal prongs out of the statue and advances on him. The Colonel follows suit, pulling out the other prong, and together they advance on the terrified sculptor.

Finally, Georg Bamberger arrives. This time, the guests mistake the millionaire for the electrician, until Schuppanzigh emerges from the cellar and declares that the fuse is fixed. The startled guests realize that Bamberger has, at long last, arrived, and Brindsley exclaims happily &quot;Everything&#x27;s all right now! Just in the nick of time!&quot; But just as he says this, Bamberger falls into the open trapdoor. As Harold, Colonel Melkett, and Carol advance on Brindsley and Clea, Schuppanzigh turns on the lights with a great flourish. There is instant darkness.

==Reception==
Shaffer described the opening night of &quot;Black Comedy&quot; the performance as &quot;a veritable detonation of human glee&quot;, and wrote of an audience member sobbing with laughter and calling out in pain. The reviews were generally good. &quot;The Times&quot; said of the piece, &quot;It may not be a milestone in the development of English drama, but it is a very funny play&quot;. J. C. Trewin in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; thought the piece overlong: &quot;If this were a revue, we might consider ten minutes ample&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Stage&quot; concurred that the piece was too long, finding it &quot;for some time clever, surprising, funny, until, fifteen minutes or so before the end Mr Shaffer&#x27;s invention, and so the impact of the piece, weakens.&quot; Claudia Cassidy in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also thought the play overlong, but noted that &quot;some of the sight and sound gags are so flawless … that the audience is reduced to jelly&quot;. &quot;The Tatler&quot;&#x27;s reviewer found the play &quot;one of the funniest farces I can remember seeing&quot;. Penelope Gilliatt in &quot;The Observer&quot; gave the piece a moderate welcome but found it &quot;a blinding idea not very boldly pursued&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Philip Hope-Wallace called it &quot;an uproarious piece of slapstick vaudeville … sometimes a little long, but it comes to a magnificent climax almost worthy of Feydeau&quot;. When the first Broadway production opened in 1967, John Chapman wrote in &quot;The Daily News&quot;, found that the author sustained the comedy from start to finish: &quot;I was sorry indeed when the stage went dark and the farce ended&quot;.

==&quot;The White Liars&quot;==

&quot;Black Comedy&quot; is often performed with another Peter Shaffer one-act, &quot;The White Liars&quot;, to form the double-bill of &quot;The White Liars and Black Comedy&quot;. The two plays are published together. &quot;The White Liars&quot; was first performed in 1967 under the title &quot;White Lies&quot;, with the original Broadway production of &quot;Black Comedy&quot;. It was billed as a &quot;curtain-raiser&quot; to &quot;Black Comedy&quot;. Peter Shaffer retitled the play for subsequent productions.

&quot;The White Liars&quot; is shorter than &quot;Black Comedy&quot;. It concerns a down-on-her-luck fortune teller living in a decaying seaside resort, and the two young men – Tom, the lead singer in a rock band, and Frank, his business manager – who consult her. It is more serious than its farcical companion piece.

<doc id="771168" wikidata="Q1071948" url="?curid=771168" title="Polynomial remainder theorem">
<text>In algebra, the polynomial remainder theorem or little Bézout&#x27;s theorem (named after Étienne Bézout) is an application of Euclidean division of polynomials. It states that, for every number formula_1, any polynomial formula_2 is the sum of formula_3 and the product of formula_4 and a polynomial in formula_5 of degree one less than the degree of formula_6. In particular, formula_3 is the remainder of the Euclidean division of formula_2 by formula_4, and formula_4 is a divisor of formula_2 if and only if formula_12, a property known as the factor theorem.

== Examples ==
=== Example 1 ===
Let formula_13. Polynomial division of formula_2 by formula_15 gives the quotient formula_16 and the remainder formula_17. By the polynomial remainder theorem, formula_18.

===Example 2===
Proof that the polynomial remainder theorem holds for an arbitrary second degree polynomial formula_19 by using algebraic manipulation:
formula_20

So, 
formula_21
which is exactly the formula of Euclidean division. 

The generalization of this proof to any degree is given below in .

== Proofs ==

=== Using Euclidean division ===
The polynomial remainder theorem follows from the theorem of Euclidean division, which, given two polynomials (the dividend) and (the divisor), asserts the existence (and the uniqueness) of a quotient and a remainder such that
:formula_22

If the divisor is formula_23 where r is a constant, then either or its degree is zero; in both cases, is a constant that is independent of ; that is 
:formula_24

Setting formula_25 in this formula, we obtain:
:formula_26

=== Direct proof ===
A constructive proofthat does not involve the existence theorem of Euclidean divisionuses the identity 
:formula_27
If formula_28 denotes the large factor in the right-hand side of this identity, and 
:formula_29
one has 
:formula_30
(since formula_31).

Adding formula_3 to both sides of this equation, one gets simultaneously the polynomial remainder theorem and the existence part of the theorem of Euclidean division for this specific case.

== Applications ==

The polynomial remainder theorem may be used to evaluate formula_3 by calculating the remainder, formula_34. Although polynomial long division is more difficult than evaluating the function itself, synthetic division is computationally easier. Thus, the function may be more &quot;cheaply&quot; evaluated using synthetic division and the polynomial remainder theorem.

The factor theorem is another application of the remainder theorem: if the remainder is zero, then the linear divisor is a factor. Repeated application of the factor theorem may be used to factorize the polynomial.

<doc id="771172" wikidata="Q696071" url="?curid=771172" title="Hunter × Hunter">
<text>Hunter × Hunter (pronounced &quot;hunter hunter&quot;) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 38 volumes as of September 2024. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.

&quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;.

The manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.

&quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.

To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand. A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making &quot;remarkable achievements in a particular field&quot;; they may then be upgraded to two stars for &quot;holding an official position&quot; and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for &quot;remarkable achievements in multiple fields&quot;.

There are four basic Nen techniques: maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense; shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one&#x27;s presence and relieving fatigue; enables a user to produce more Nen; and is a person&#x27;s specific use of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities; project aura out of their bodies; control objects or living things; change the type or properties of their aura; create objects out of their aura; and have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories. A Nen user can enter into a where, by pledging to follow certain , their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order to have an unbreakable chain that will fully restrain members of the Phantom Troupe, offered his life, should he use it on anyone other than its members.

===Plot===

The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents were dead. But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on to take the in order to become a Hunter like him. During the exam, Gon meets and befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world&#x27;s most notorious assassin family. Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After many trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due to the influence of his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family&#x27;s estate in shame.

After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the , a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves and gain monetary rewards. There they meet Zushi, a fellow Heavens Arena applicant, who has a kung fu master named Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practitioners to manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in where they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the occasion, two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest in order to rescue Gon and Killua from being captured, but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.

A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing &quot;Greed Island&quot;, an extremely rare and expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging&#x27;s whereabouts. While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by a team led by none other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With Biscuit&#x27;s help, Gon and Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. Killua takes a short break from Greed Island to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.

Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but the duo are sent to meet Kite instead. They decide to help with Kite&#x27;s research of a man-sized Chimera Ant queen, an insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen from consuming Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including Netero, the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king Meruem, whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him with a bomb implanted in his body that poisons him to death soon after. Meanwhile, Gon has a showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite. After overusing Nen to exact his revenge, he is hospitalized and in critical condition. After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association&#x27;s top echelons the Zodiacs, from which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero&#x27;s replacement as Chairman, while Killua returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon&#x27;s life. His family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi&#x27;s attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon&#x27;s side and have him fully restored. He then attempts to seal away Alluka&#x27;s alter ego which grants them their power (Nanika, likely a creature from the Dark Continent), but at the last moment decides to revert the process rather than seal away Nanika Alluka&#x27;s only other friend. Killua then parts ways with Gon to travel the world with Alluka, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.

Some time later, Netero&#x27;s son Beyond assembles an expedition to the , the forbidden, vast area outside of the known world; he is sponsored by the Kingdom of Kakin. Fearing that the expedition may bring disaster, just like in all previous attempts, the world&#x27;s five greatest powers accept that Kakin join their ranks in exchange for full authority over its findings. To accompany Beyond and ensure his compliance, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him and invite Kurapika and Leorio to join them, replacing Ging and former Vice-Chairman Pariston Hill, who assembled their own Dark Continent exploration teams by Beyond&#x27;s request. Meanwhile, Chrollo regains his powers and fulfills Hisoka&#x27;s wish to have a duel with him, which ends with Hisoka defeated and nearly killed. After reviving through Nen, Hisoka starts killing off the Phantom Troupe members one by one, who have boarded Kakin&#x27;s ship to the Dark Continent to rob it. Aboard the ship, Nasubi, the king of Kakin, starts a battle to the death between his heirs to decide his successor. Kurapika, who also infiltrated the ship with other Hunters, takes part in the succession war as the bodyguard of Fourteenth Prince Wobble, Kakin&#x27;s youngest prince and a toddler. Kurapika&#x27;s personal objective, however, is to retrieve the last batch of scarlet eyes of the Kurta Clan in custody of Tserriednich, Kakin&#x27;s Fourth Prince.

==Production==
Author Yoshihiro Togashi explained that one of his hobbies was collecting objects of all sorts, so he was inspired to create a manga involving collecting titled &quot;(something) Hunter&quot;. He came up with the final name &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; while watching the television variety show &quot;Downtown&quot;, in which the hosts often repeat what they say to make the audience laugh. The &quot;×&quot; in the title is silent. As with his previous series, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, Togashi used drafting ink and &quot;Kabura&quot; pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them. Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga&#x27;s production; however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume. With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga&#x27;s theme of a young boy searching for his father.

There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; for low-quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their &quot;tankōbon&quot; (collected volume) releases. In addition, the publication history of the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; manga has been plagued with hiatuses since 2006, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of time. After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014, and joining the English-language &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; lineup, the manga went on another just two months later. The series returned from this hiatus on April 18, 2016, however, just over two months later, &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; began another hiatus on June 4, 2016. It came back on June 26, 2017, and just over two months later, on August 31, the series went on hiatus again, planning to return by the end of that year. The series came back on January 29, 2018, before going on hiatus again on April 9 of the same year. After a five-month hiatus, the manga resumed publication from September 22 to November 26, 2018, before entering another hiatus.

In May 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account where he teased that the series would resume publication. In July of that same year, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems, but was able to resume drawing by doing so while laying down; in August, Togashi posted that he decided to increase his staff, adding that the background effects for chapter 399 were done according to his request, and that chapter 400 would follow once he had handed in his specifications for it. The series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus; the longest the series has ever had. On December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would once again enter on hiatus. The &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; editorial department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they knew concrete details of its return and how it would be serialized, they would reveal the details in the magazine. On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted that chapter 401 was completed, but the form of publication was not decided at the time. On October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase &quot;Start over&quot; in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler below. On May 1, 2024, Togashi made another tweet, sharing a photo with the number 5 on the corner of a page, stating that he was working on chapter 405; the following day, he posted a picture of two more pages, numbered 6 and 7 respectively. On July 22 of the same year, Togashi made posts stating that instructions for the backgrounds were ready for his assistants for chapters 409 and 410; Togashi also teased progress for up to chapter 416 a week prior. The series resumed in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from October 7 to December 9, 2024, before entering another hiatus.

In November 2023, on TV Asahi&#x27;s variety show &quot;&quot;, Togashi announced that he had planned four possible scenarios for the series&#x27; finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during the program. Only the fourth abandoned ending (&quot;ending D&quot;) was revealed, stating that it could be considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip, years into the future, featuring Gon&#x27;s granddaughter, Gin. Togashi expressed a desire to create a satisfying enough conclusion so he would not have to resort to endings A, B, or C. Togashi stated that the readers&#x27; reactions would be 80% positive on ending A, even split on ending B, and 90% negative on ending C. While acknowledging ending A as a &quot;safe&quot;, noncontroversial option, Togashi personally preferred ending C, despite expecting significant criticism from fans.

=====Original video animations=====

When the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; anime covered most of its source material by 2001, Nippon Animation made the decision to end the adaptation rather than continue it with filler. Due to fans&#x27; unsatisfied reactions to the conclusion of the television series, three subsequent OVAs were produced by Nippon Animation. These carried the plot from where the broadcast left off during the Yorknew City arc and covered the Greed Island arc. The first OVA series was directed by Satoshi Saga and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from January 17 to April 17, 2002.

This number had grown to 66.3 million copies by 2014. The manga had over 72 million copies in circulation by December 2018; over 79 million copies in circulation by November 2021; and over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.

In North America, volumes 23 through 27 have ranked within the top 300 best-selling graphics novels list of sales estimates by Diamond Comic Distributors.

====Critical reception====
The &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; manga has received much praise for its plot and characters. In his 2007 book &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson described its storyline as &quot;an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery&quot; that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis and a larger scale. Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters, the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold reader interest. In a different review for &quot;Anime News Network&quot; in 2012, Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because &quot;it is every manga in one, with training sequences, tournament battles, a crime-mystery story arc, and a virtual-reality, RPG-style story arc&quot;. But unlike most manga, he called &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; &quot;incredibly dense.&quot; Examples being its fictional nen ability, which is explained &quot;so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist,&quot; and the little challenges and games the characters face; &quot;Over and over Togashi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them; if he ever wants to change careers, I&#x27;d suggest game designer.&quot; Thompson praised the character art as great, pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and chibi like other artists, Togashi has cartoony and realistic characters interacting in the same panels. Thompson did note how the artwork during its magazine run is often &quot;sketchy&quot; and missing backgrounds, but that Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected &quot;tankōbon&quot; release. Mentioning Togashi&#x27;s love of gore he stated &quot;the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy, adult themes&quot; and noted how some panels later in the manga are apparently censored for gore by being covered with screentone.

Reviewing the first story arc, Chris Sims of ComicsAlliance called &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; one of the most &quot;fun, ridiculous, and ludicrously violent comics I&#x27;ve ever read.&quot; He stated that while it has every idea about manga in force, what sticks out the most is the violence. Sims summed it up as &quot;full of clever setups and characters that, while simple to the point of almost seeming one-dimensional at times, still manage to be solid and entertaining based on their reaction to the increasingly strange, increasingly deadly events around them&quot;. Charles Solomon, a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised the moral seriousness of Gon, a quality that gives the protagonist &quot;an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga, stating that Togashi &quot;shows a deft touch&quot; with its standard story, calling his artwork &quot;clear and graceful&quot;, and mentioning that his characters are &quot;endearing and complex&quot;. While Rika Takahashi of EX.org and Claude J. Pelletier of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; found the art style in &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; to be much simpler than Togashi&#x27;s two previous serializations, &quot;Level E&quot; and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, both reviewers appreciated the intricate narrative and characters.

===Anime===
====1999 series====
The first &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; anime series has enjoyed much more modest popularity than its manga source. &quot;Newtype&quot; listed it as having a Japanese television rating of 10.5 for the fourth quarter of 2000. The show&#x27;s viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February 2001. The series was voted as the 16th best anime of 2000 in the Anime Grand Prix, but rose to fourth place the following year. In 2001, the staff of the magazine listed &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; as the 94th most important anime of all time. In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; television series was voted 28th best anime of all time. In 2010, Mania.com&#x27;s Briana Lawrence listed &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; at number nine of the website&#x27;s &quot;10 Anime Series That Need a Reboot&quot;.

Critical reception for the first &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; television adaptation has been generally favorable. Miyako Matsuda of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;, Carl Kimlinger of the &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, and Derrick L. Tucker of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; all expressed positive views of the series&#x27; narrative and characters. Matsuda admired the adventure-filled world of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; and the practical character qualities of friendship, effort, and victory inserted by Togashi. Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume, Kimlinger summarized, &quot;Togashi&#x27;s plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Furuhashi&#x27;s visuals inventive yet attuned to the measured pacing of the series. Together they create a &quot;shonen&quot; action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience&#x27;s intelligence. A strange combination indeed.&quot; Tucker admitted to being &quot;bewitched&quot; by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members. Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series. Theron Martin of &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, found the first fifteen episodes entertainment, and stated &quot;Gon also inherits Goku&#x27;s inherent likability, some of the &quot;part of the challenge is figuring out what the challenge is&quot; bits are rather clever, and setting up a situation where a tournament proctor is actually called out for being in the wrong is a nice twist. It does also have some fun moments&quot;.

The art and animation of the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi&#x27;s work by Furuhashi as having &quot;understated energy and flair, making the most of the era&#x27;s (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends&#x27; physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life.&quot; Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. &quot;The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is,&quot; the reviewer commented, &quot;hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater.&quot; Opinions of the series&#x27; sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean&#x27;s voice overs. Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential. Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as &quot;a letdown since day one&quot;.

====2011 series====
Madhouse&#x27;s 2011 adaptation was met with near-universal critical acclaim. Adrian Marcano from Inverse considered &quot;Hunter x Hunter 2011&quot; to be one of the greatest anime series ever. He said that the anime set itself apart with one of the greatest story arcs in anime history in which the villain, not the hero, takes the anime to instant classic status. He also said that, &quot;It is in the 2011 version where we see probably one of the best story arcs in anime history: the Chimera Ant Arc.&quot; According to &quot;Movie News Guide&quot; and &quot;Latin Post&quot;, the Madhouse&#x27;s 2011 version received more viewers not only in Japan but also around the world, particularly in North America. Nick Creamer held similar sentiments, writing &quot;the show&#x27;s fantastic aesthetics elevate it above almost everything out there – in direction, in sound design, in pacing, in animation, in basically every relevant aesthetic metric, Hunter x Hunter triumphs. That it&#x27;s been maintaining this level of quality for well over a hundred episodes is nothing short of astonishing.&quot;

In 2019, &quot;Polygon&quot; named the series as one of the best anime of the 2010s, and Crunchyroll listed it in their &quot;Top 25 best anime of the 2010s&quot;. IGN also listed the &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; 2011 adaptation among the best anime series of the 2010s.

<text>Cyberterrorism is the use of the Internet to conduct violent acts that result in, or threaten, the loss of life or significant bodily harm, in order to achieve political or ideological gains through threat or intimidation. Emerging alongside the development of information technology, cyberterrorism involves acts of deliberate, large-scale disruption of computer networks, especially of personal computers attached to the Internet by means of tools such as computer viruses, computer worms, phishing, malicious software, hardware methods, and programming scripts can all be forms of internet terrorism. Some authors opt for a very narrow definition of cyberterrorism, relating to deployment by known terrorist organizations of disruption attacks against information systems for the primary purpose of creating alarm, panic, or physical disruption. Other authors prefer a broader definition, which includes cybercrime. Participating in a cyberattack affects the terror threat perception, even if it isn&#x27;t done with a violent approach. By some definitions, it might be difficult to distinguish which instances of online activities are cyberterrorism or cybercrime.

Cyberterrorism can be also defined as the intentional use of computers, networks, and public internet to cause destruction and harm for personal objectives. Experienced cyberterrorists, who are very skilled in terms of hacking can cause massive damage to government systems and might leave a country in fear of further attacks. The objectives of such terrorists may be political or ideological since this can be considered a form of terror.

There is much concern from government and media sources about potential damage that could be caused by cyberterrorism, and this has prompted efforts by government agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to put an end to cyber attacks and cyberterrorism.

There have been several major and minor instances of cyberterrorism. Al-Qaeda utilized the internet to communicate with supporters and even to recruit new members. Estonia, a Baltic country which is constantly evolving in terms of technology, became a battleground for cyberterrorism in April 2007 after disputes regarding the relocation of a WWII soviet statue located in Estonia&#x27;s capital Tallinn.

==Overview==

There is debate over the basic definition of the scope of cyberterrorism. These definitions can be narrow such as the use of Internet to attack other systems in the Internet that result to violence against persons or property. They can also be broad, those that include any form of Internet usage by terrorists to conventional attacks on information technology infrastructures. There is variation in qualification by motivation, targets, methods, and centrality of computer use in the act. U.S. government agencies also use varying definitions and that none of these have so far attempted to introduce a standard that is binding outside of their sphere of influence.

Depending on context, cyberterrorism may overlap considerably with cybercrime, cyberwar or ordinary terrorism. Eugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab, now feels that &quot;cyberterrorism&quot; is a more accurate term than &quot;cyberwar&quot;. He states that &quot;with today&#x27;s attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It&#x27;s not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism.&quot; He also equates large-scale cyber weapons, such as the Flame Virus and NetTraveler Virus which his company discovered, to biological weapons, claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.

If cyberterrorism is treated similarly to traditional terrorism, then it only includes attacks that threaten property or lives, and can be defined as the leveraging of a target&#x27;s computers and information, particularly via the Internet, to cause physical, real-world harm or severe disruption of infrastructure.

Many academics and researchers who specialize in terrorism studies suggest that cyberterrorism does not exist and is really a matter of hacking or information warfare. They disagree with labeling it as terrorism because of the unlikelihood of the creation of fear, significant physical harm, or death in a population using electronic means, considering current attack and protective technologies.

If death or physical damage that could cause human harm is considered a necessary part of the cyberterrorism definition, then there have been few identifiable incidents of cyberterrorism, although there has been much policy research and public concern. Modern terrorism and political violence is not easily defined, however, and some scholars assert that it is now &quot;unbounded&quot; and not exclusively concerned with physical damage.

There is an old saying that death or loss of property are the side products of terrorism, the main purpose of such incidents is to &quot;create terror&quot; in peoples&#x27; minds and harm bystanders. If any incident in cyberspace can &quot;create terror&quot;, it may be rightly called cyberterrorism. For those affected by such acts, the fears of cyberterrorism are quite real.

As with cybercrime in general, the threshold of required knowledge and skills to perpetrate acts of cyberterrorism has been steadily diminishing thanks to freely available hacking suites and online courses. Additionally, the physical and virtual worlds are merging at an accelerated rate, making for many more targets of opportunity which is evidenced by such notable cyber attacks as Stuxnet, the Saudi petrochemical sabotage attempt in 2018 and others.

===Defining cyberterrorism===

Assigning a concrete definition to cyberterrorism can be hard, due to the difficulty of defining the term terrorism itself. Multiple organizations have created their own definitions, most of which are overly broad. There is also controversy concerning overuse of the term, hyperbole in the media and by security vendors trying to sell &quot;solutions&quot;.

One way of understanding cyberterrorism involves the idea that terrorists could cause massive loss of life, worldwide economic chaos and environmental damage by hacking into critical infrastructure systems. The nature of cyberterrorism covers conduct involving computer or Internet technology that:
# is motivated by a political, religious or ideological cause
# is intended to intimidate a government or a section of the public to varying degrees
# seriously interferes with infrastructure

The term &quot;cyberterrorism&quot; can be used in a variety of different ways, but there are limits to its use. An attack on an Internet business can be labeled cyberterrorism, however when it is done for economic motivations rather than ideological it is typically regarded as cybercrime. Convention also limits the label &quot;cyberterrorism&quot; to actions by individuals, independent groups, or organizations. Any form of cyberwarfare conducted by governments and states would be regulated and punishable under international law.

The Technolytics Institute defines cyberterrorism as [t]he premeditated use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and/or networks, with the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives. Or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives. The term appears first in defense literature, surfacing (as &quot;cyber-terrorism&quot;) in reports by the U.S. Army War College as early as 1998.

The National Conference of State Legislatures, an organization of legislators created to help policymakers in the United States with issues such as economy and homeland security defines cyberterrorism as:

[T]he use of information technology by terrorist groups and individuals to further their agenda. This can include use of information technology to organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and telecommunications infrastructures, or for exchanging information or making threats electronically. Examples are hacking into computer systems, introducing viruses to vulnerable networks, web site defacing, Denial-of-service attacks, or terroristic threats made via electronic communication.
The American Federal Emergency Management agency defines cyberterrorism as:

[T]he illegal threat and the attack against computers, networks, and information stored, where it is carried out to frighten and force the government or its people ti achieve political or social objectives.

NATO defines cyberterrorism as &quot;[a] cyberattack using or exploiting computer or communication networks to cause sufficient destruction or disruption to generate fear or to intimidate a society into an ideological goal&quot;.

The United States National Infrastructure Protection Center defined cyberterrorism as: A criminal act perpetrated by the use of computers and telecommunications capabilities resulting in violence, destruction, and/or disruption of services to create fear by causing confusion and uncertainty within a given population, with the goal of influencing a government or population to conform to a political, social, or ideological agenda.
The FBI, another United States agency, defines &quot;cyber terrorism&quot; as &quot;premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which results in violence against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents&quot;.

These definitions tend to share the view of cyberterrorism as politically and/or ideologically inclined. One area of debate is the difference between cyberterrorism and hacktivism. Hacktivism is &quot;the marriage of hacking with political activism&quot;. Both actions are politically driven and involve using computers, however cyberterrorism is primarily used to cause harm. It becomes an issue because acts of violence on the computer can be labeled either cyberterrorism or hacktivism.

===Types of cyberterror capability===
In 1999 the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Irregular Warfare at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, defined three levels of cyberterror capability:

* Simple-Unstructured: the capability to conduct basic hacks against individual systems using tools created by someone else. The organization possesses little target-analysis, command-and-control, or learning capability.
* Advanced-Structured: the capability to conduct more sophisticated attacks against multiple systems or networks and possibly, to modify or create basic hacking-tools. The organization possesses an elementary target-analysis, command-and-control, and learning capability.
* Complex-Coordinated: the capability for a coordinated attack capable of causing mass-disruption against integrated, heterogeneous defenses (including cryptography). Ability to create sophisticated hacking tools. Highly capable target-analysis, command-and-control, and organization learning-capability.

===Concerns===
Cyberterrorism is becoming more and more prominent on social media today. As the Internet becomes more pervasive, individuals or groups can use the anonymity afforded by cyberspace to threaten other individuals, specific groups (with membership based, for example, on ethnicity or belief), communities and entire countries, without the inherent threat of identification, capture, injury, or death of the attacker that being physically present would bring.
Many groups such as Anonymous, use tools such as denial-of-service attacks to attack and censor groups which oppose them, creating many concerns for freedom and respect for differences of thought.

Many believe that cyberterrorism is an extreme threat to countries&#x27; economies, and fear an attack could potentially lead to another Great Depression. Several leaders agree that cyberterrorism has the highest percentage of threat over other possible attacks on U.S. territory. Although natural disasters are considered a top threat and have proven to be devastating to people and land, there is ultimately little that can be done to prevent such events from happening. Thus, the expectation is to focus more on preventative measures that will make Internet attacks impossible for execution.

As the Internet continues to expand, and computer systems continue to be assigned increased responsibility while becoming more complex and interdependent, sabotage or terrorism via the Internet may become a more serious threat and is possibly one of the top 10 events to &quot;end the human race.&quot; People have much easier access to illegal involvement within cyberspace by the ability to access a part of the internet known as the Dark Web. The Internet of Things promises to further merge the virtual and physical worlds, which some experts see as a powerful incentive for states to use terrorist proxies in furtherance of objectives.

Dependence on the Internet is rapidly increasing on a worldwide scale, creating a platform for international cyber-terror plots to be formulated and executed as a direct threat to national security. For terrorists, cyber-based attacks have distinct advantages over physical attacks. They can be conducted remotely, anonymously, and relatively cheaply, and they do not require significant investment in weapons, explosives or personnel. The effects can be widespread and profound. Incidents of cyberterrorism are likely to increase. They can be expected to take place through denial-of-service attacks, malware, and other methods that are difficult to envision today. One example involves the deaths involving the Islamic State and the online social networks Twitter, Google, and Facebook – leading to legal action being taken against them, that ultimately resulted in them being sued.

In an article about cyber attacks by Iran and North Korea, &quot;The New York Times&quot; observes:
 The appeal of digital weapons is similar to that of nuclear capability: it is a way for an outgunned, outfinanced nation to even the playing field. &quot;These countries are pursuing cyberweapons the same way they are pursuing nuclear weapons,&quot; said James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;It&#x27;s primitive; it&#x27;s not top of the line, but it&#x27;s good enough and they are committed to getting it.&quot;
In addition, Cyberterrorism has also been documented to arouse negative emotions. Recent studies have suggested that Cyberterrorism produces heightened levels of anger and stress, which do not differ drastically from the effects of conventional terrorism. Researchers also noted that Cyberterrorism produced higher levels of stress than anger, and the responses are not dependent on the lethality of the attack.

===History===
Public interest in cyberterrorism began in the late 1990s, when the term was coined by Barry C. Collin. As 2000 approached, the fear and uncertainty about the millennium bug heightened, as did the potential for attacks by cyber terrorists. Although the millennium bug was by no means a terrorist attack or plot against the world or the United States, it did act as a catalyst in sparking the fears of a possibly large-scale devastating cyber-attack. Commentators noted that many of the facts of such incidents seemed to change, often with exaggerated media reports.

The high-profile terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, and the ensuing War on Terror by the US led to further media coverage of the potential threats of cyberterrorism in the years following. Mainstream media coverage often discusses the possibility of a large attack making use of computer networks to sabotage critical infrastructures with the aim of putting human lives in jeopardy or causing disruption on a national scale either directly or by disruption of the national economy.

Authors such as Winn Schwartau and John Arquilla are reported to have had considerable financial success selling books which described what were purported to be plausible scenarios of mayhem caused by cyberterrorism. Many critics claim that these books were unrealistic in their assessments of whether the attacks described (such as nuclear meltdowns and chemical plant explosions) were possible. A common thread throughout what critics perceive as cyberterror-hype is that of non-falsifiability; that is, when the predicted disasters fail to occur, it only goes to show how lucky we&#x27;ve been so far, rather than impugning the theory.

In 2016, for the first time ever, the Department of Justice charged Ardit Ferizi with cyberterrorism. He is accused of allegedly hacking into a military website and stealing the names, addresses, and other personal information of government and military personnel and selling it to ISIS.

On the other hand, it is also argued that, despite substantial studies on cyberterrorism, the body of literature is still unable to present a realistic estimate of the actual threat. For instance, in the case of a cyberterrorist attack on a public infrastructure such as a power plant or air traffic control through hacking, there is uncertainty as to its success because data concerning such phenomena are limited.

=== Current threats ===
Cyberterrorism ranks among the highest potential security threats in the world. It has become more critical than the development of nuclear weapons or the current conflicts between nations. Due to the pervasiveness of the internet and the amount of responsibility assigned to this technology, digital weapons pose a threat to entire economic or social systems. Some of the most critical international security concerns include:

DDoS Attacks – Millions of Denial of Service attacks occur every year and the service disruption can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each hour they are down. It is important to keep critical systems secured and redundant to remain online during these attacks.

Social Engineering – In 1997 an experiment conducted by the NSA concluded that thirty-five hackers were able to access critical pentagon computer systems and could easily edit accounts, reformat data and even shut down entire systems. Often they used phishing tactics such as calling offices and pretending to be technicians to gain passwords.

Third Party Software – The top retailers are connected with thousands of separate third-party recourses and at least 23% of those assets have at least one critical vulnerability. These companies need to manage and reevaluate their network security in order to keep personal data safe.

=== Future threats ===
As technology becomes more and more integrated into society, new vulnerabilities and security threats are opened up on these complex networks that we have set up. If an intruder was to gain access to these networks they have the potential to threaten entire communities or economic systems. There is no certainty for what events will take place in the future, which is why it is important that there are systems build to adapt to the changing environment.

The most apparent cyberterrorism threat in our near future will involve the state of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies cannot expect that every home office is up to date and secure so they must adopt a zero-trust policy from home devices. This means that they must assume corporate resources and unsecured devices are sharing the same space and they must act accordingly.

The rise of cryptocurrency has also sparked some additional threats in the realm of security. Cyber Criminals are now hijacking home computers and company networks in order to mine certain cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. This mining process requires an immense amount of computer processing power which can cripple a business’ network and lead to severe downtime if the issue is not resolved.

==International attacks and response==

===Conventions===

As of 2016 there have been eighteen conventions and major legal instruments that specifically deal with terrorist activities and cyber terrorism.

* 1963: Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft

=== Motivations for cyberattacks ===

There are many different motives for cyberattacks, with the majority being for financial reasons. However, there is increasing evidence that hackers are becoming more politically motivated. Cyberterrorists are aware that governments are reliant on the internet and have exploited this as a result. For example, Mohammad Bin Ahmad As-Sālim&#x27;s piece &quot;39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad&quot; discusses how an electronic jihad could disrupt the West through targeted hacks of American websites, and other resources seen as anti-Jihad, modernist, or secular in orientation (Denning, 2010; Leyden, 2007).

Many of the cyberattacks are not conducted for money, rather the cyberattacks are conducted due to different ideological beliefs and due to wanting to get personal revenge and outrage towards company or individual, the cybercriminal is attacking. An employee might want to get revenge on a company if they were mistreated or wrongfully terminated.

Other motivations for cybercriminals include:

* Political goals 
* Competition between companies 
* Cyberwarfare between two countries
* Money 
Political goals motivate cyber-attackers because they are not happy with candidates and they might want certain candidates to win the election, therefore, they might alter the election voting to help their preferred candidate win.

Competition between two companies can also stir up a cyberattack, as one company can hire a hacker to conduct the attack on a company as they might want to test the rival company&#x27;s security. This will also benefit a company because it will force their competitor&#x27;s customers to think that the company is not secure due to them getting cyber attacked effortlessly and they don&#x27;t want any of their personal credentials getting leaked.

Cyberwarfare is motivation for countries that are fighting each other. This is mainly used to weaken the opposing country by compromising its core systems and the countries data and other vulnerable information.

Money is motivating for cyber attacks for ransomware, phishing, and data theft as the cyber criminals can differently contact the victims and ask for money and in return the data stays safe.

=== International Institutions ===

The United Nations has several agencies that seek to address in cyberterrorism, including, the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, and the International Telecommunication Union. Both EUROPOL and INTERPOL also notably specialize on the subject.

Both Europol and Interpol specialize in operations against cyberterrorism as they both collaborate on different operations together and host a yearly joint cybercrime conference. While they both fight against cybercrime, both institutions operate differently. Europol sets up and coordinates cross-border operations against cybercriminals in the EU, while Interpol helps law enforcement and coordinates operations against cyber criminals globally.

===Estonia and NATO===
The Baltic state of Estonia was the target of a massive denial-of-service attack that ultimately rendered the country offline and shut out from services dependent on Internet connectivity in April 2007. The infrastructure of Estonia including everything from online banking and mobile phone networks to government services and access to health care information was disabled for a time. The tech-dependent state experienced severe turmoil and there was a great deal of concern over the nature and intent of the attack.

The cyber attack was a result of an Estonian-Russian dispute over the removal of a bronze statue depicting a World War II-era Soviet soldier from the center of the capital, Tallinn. In the midst of the armed conflict with Russia, Georgia likewise was subject to sustained and coordinated attacks on its electronic infrastructure in August 2008. In both of these cases, circumstantial evidence point to coordinated Russian attacks, but attribution of the attacks is difficult; though both the countries blame Moscow for contributing to the cyber attacks, proof establishing legal culpability is lacking.

Estonia joined NATO in 2004, which prompted NATO to carefully monitor its member states&#x27; response to the attack. NATO also feared escalation and the possibility of cascading effects beyond Estonia&#x27;s border to other NATO members. In 2008, directly as a result of the attacks, NATO opened a new center of excellence on cyberdefense to conduct research and training on cyber warfare in Tallinn.

The chaos resulting from the attacks in Estonia illustrated to the world the dependence countries had on information technology. This dependence then makes countries vulnerable to future cyber attacks and terrorism.

Quick information on the cyber attack on Estonia and its effects on the country.

* Online services of Estoninan banks and government services were taken down by uncontrollable high level of internet traffic
* Media outlets were also down and so broadcasters could not deliver the news of the cyber attacks
* Some of the services were under attack for 22 days, while other online services were taken down completely
* Riots and Looting went on for 48 hours in Tallinn, Estonia
* The cyber attack served as a wake up call to Estonia and for the entire world on the importance of cyber defence.

As cyberattacks continue to increase around the world, countries still look at the attacks on Estonia in the 2007 as an example of how countries can fight future cyberattacks and terrorism. As a result of the attacks, Estonia is now currently one of the top countries in cyber defence and online safety and its capital city of Tallinn is home to NATO&#x27;s cyber defense hub. The government of Estonia continues to update there cyber defence protocols and national cybersecurity strategies. NATO&#x27;s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre in Tallinn also conducts research and training on cyber security to not just help Estonia but other countries that are in the alliance.

===China===

The Chinese Defense Ministry confirmed the existence of an online defense unit in May 2011. Composed of about thirty elite internet specialists, the so-called &quot;Cyber Blue Team&quot;, or &quot;Blue Army&quot;, is officially claimed to be engaged in cyber-defense operations, though there are fears the unit has been used to penetrate secure online systems of foreign governments. China&#x27;s leaders have invested in its foundations of cyber defense and quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 39 Chinese soldiers were chosen  to strengthen China&#x27;s cyber defenses. The reason given by Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, Geng Yansheng was that their internet protection was currently weak. Geng claimed that the program was only temporary to help improve cyber defenses.

=== India ===

To counter the cyber terrorists, also called &quot;white-collar jihadis&quot;, the police in India has registered private citizens as volunteers who patrol the internet and report the suspected cyber terrorists to the government. These volunteers are categorised in three categories, namely &quot;Unlawful Content Flaggers&quot;, &quot;Cyber Awareness Promoters&quot; and &quot;Cyber Experts&quot;. In August 2021, police arrested five suspected white-collar jihadis who were preparing a hit list of officers, journalists, social activists, lawyers and political functionaries to create fear among people. The white-collar jihadis are considered &quot;worst kind of terrorists&quot; as they remain anonymous and safe in other nations, but inflict &quot;immeasurable&quot; amount of damage and brainwashing.

In India, the demand for cyber security professionals has increased over 100 per cent in 2021 and will rise 200 per cent by 2024.

Eighty two percent of companies in India had a ransomware attack in the year 2020. The cost it takes to recover from a ransomware attack in India has gone from $1.1 million in 2020 to $3.38 million in 2021. India is at the top of the list of 30 countries for ransomware attacks.

A cyber-attack took place on the electricity grid in Maharashtra that resulted in a power outage. This occurred in October 2020 and the authorities believe China was behind it.

Important information like dates of birth and full names were leaked for thousands of patients who were tested for COVID-19. This information was made accessible on Google and was leaked from government websites. The job portal IIMjobs was attacked and the information of 1.4 million people looking for jobs was leaked. The information leaked was quite extensive including the location of users and their names and phone numbers. The information for 500,000 Indian police personal was sold on a forum in February 2021. The information contained much personal information. The data was from a police exam taken in December 2019.

===Korea===

According to 2016 Deloitte Asia-Pacific Defense Outlook, South Korea&#x27;s &#x27;Cyber Risk Score&#x27; was 884 out of 1,000 and South Korea is found to be the most vulnerable country to cyber attacks in the Asia-Pacific region. Considering South Korea&#x27;s high speed internet and cutting-edge technology, its cyber security infrastructure is relatively weak. The 2013 South Korea cyberattack significantly damaged the Korean economy. This attack wounded the systems of two banks and the computer networks of three TV broadcasters. The incident was a massive blow, and the attacker was never identified. It was theorized to be North Korea. The week before North Korea accused the United States and South Korea of shutting down their internet for two days. In 2017, a ransomware attack harassed private companies and users, who experienced personal information leakage. Additionally, there were North Korea&#x27;s cyber attacks which risked national security of South Korea.

In response to this, South Korean government&#x27;s countermeasure is to protect the information security centres the National Intelligence Agency. Currently, &#x27;cyber security&#x27; is one of the major goals of NIS Korea. Since 2013, South Korea had established policies related to National cyber security and trying to prevent cyber crises via sophisticated investigation on potential threats. Meanwhile, scholars emphasize on improving the national consciousness towards cyber attacks as South Korea had already entered the so-called &#x27;hyper connected society&#x27;.

North Korea&#x27;s cyberwarfare is incredibly efficient and the best of state-sponsored hackers. Those who are chosen to be hackers are selected when they are young and trained specifically in cyberwarfare. Hackers are trained to steal money from ATMs but not enough to be reported. North Korea is great at zero-day exploits. The country will hack anyone they chose to. They steal secrets from companies and government agencies and steal money from financial systems to fund their hacking operations.

===Pakistan===

Pakistani Government has also taken steps to curb the menace of cyberterrorism and extremist propaganda. National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) is working on joint programs with different NGOs and other cyber security organizations in Pakistan to combat this problem. Surf Safe Pakistan is one such example. Now people in Pakistan can report extremist and terrorist related content online on Surf Safe Pakistan portal. The National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) provides the Federal Government&#x27;s leadership for the Surf Safe Campaign.

=== Ukraine ===

A series of powerful cyber attacks began 27 June 2017, that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.

===USA ===

The US Department of Defense (DoD) charged the United States Strategic Command with the duty of combating cyberterrorism. This is accomplished through the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations, which is the operational component supporting USSTRATCOM in defense of the DoD&#x27;s Global Information Grid. This is done by integrating GNO capabilities into the operations of all DoD computers, networks, and systems used by DoD combatant commands, services and agencies.

On 2 November 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the creation of the Air Force&#x27;s newest MAJCOM, the Air Force Cyber Command, which would be tasked to monitor and defend American interest in cyberspace. The plan was however replaced by the creation of Twenty-Fourth Air Force which became active in August 2009 and would be a component of the planned United States Cyber Command.

On 22 December 2009, the White House named its head of computer security as Howard Schmidt to coordinate U.S Government, military and intelligence efforts to repel hackers. He left the position in May 2012. Michael Daniel was appointed to the position of White House Coordinator of Cyber Security the same week and continues in the position during the second term of the Obama administration.

Obama signed an executive order to enable the US to impose sanctions on either individuals or entities that are suspected to be participating in cyber related acts. These acts were assessed to be possible threats to US national security, financial issues or foreign policy issues. U.S. authorities indicted a man over 92 cyberterrorism hacks attacks on computers used by the Department of Defense. A Nebraska-based consortium apprehended four million hacking attempts in the course of eight weeks. In 2011 cyberterrorism attacks grew 20%.

In May 2021, President Joe Biden announced an executive order aiming to improve America&#x27;s cybersecurity. It came about after an increase in cybersecurity attacks aimed at the country&#x27;s public and private sector. The plan aims to improve the government&#x27;s cyberdefense by working on its ability to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to attacks. The plan has 10 sections written into the document that include, to name a few, improving sharing of threat information, modernizing the government&#x27;s cybersecurity, and establishing a Cybersecurity Review Board.

==Examples==
An operation can be done by anyone anywhere in the world, for it can be performed thousands of miles away from a target. An attack can cause serious damage to a critical infrastructure which may result in casualties.

Some attacks are conducted in furtherance of political and social objectives, as the following examples illustrate:

* In 1996, a computer hacker allegedly associated with the White Supremacist movement temporarily disabled a Massachusetts ISP and damaged part of the ISP&#x27;s record keeping system. The ISP had attempted to stop the hacker from sending out worldwide racist messages under the ISP&#x27;s name. The hacker signed off with the threat: &quot;you have yet to see true electronic terrorism. This is a promise.&quot;
* In 1998, Spanish protesters bombarded the Institute for Global Communications (IGC) with thousands of bogus e-mail messages. E-mail was tied up and undeliverable to the ISP&#x27;s users, and support lines were tied up with people who couldn&#x27;t get their mail. The protestors also spammed IGC staff and member accounts, clogged their Web page with bogus credit card orders, and threatened to employ the same tactics against organizations using IGC services. They demanded that IGC stop hosting the Web site for the Euskal Herria Journal, a New York-based publication supporting Basque independence. Protestors said IGC supported terrorism because a section on the Web pages contained materials on the terrorist group ETA, which claimed responsibility for assassinations of Spanish political and security officials, and attacks on military installations. IGC finally relented and pulled the site because of the &quot;mail bombings&quot;.
* In 1998, ethnic Tamil guerrillas attempted to disrupt Sri Lankan embassies by sending large volumes of e-mail. The embassies received 800 e-mails a day over a two-week period. The messages read &quot;We are the Internet Black Tigers and we&#x27;re doing this to disrupt your communications.&quot; Intelligence authorities characterized it as the first known attack by terrorists against a country&#x27;s computer systems.
* During the Kosovo conflict in 1999, NATO computers were blasted with e-mail bombs and hit with denial-of-service attacks by hacktivists protesting the NATO bombings. In addition, businesses, public organizations and academic institutes received highly politicized virus-laden e-mails from a range of Eastern European countries, according to reports. Web defacements were also common. After the Chinese Embassy was accidentally bombed in Belgrade, Chinese hacktivists posted messages such as &quot;We won&#x27;t stop attacking until the war stops!&quot; on U.S. government Web sites.
* Since December 1997, the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) has been conducting Web sit-ins against various sites in support of the Mexican Zapatistas. At a designated time, thousands of protestors point their browsers to a target site using software that floods the target with rapid and repeated download requests. EDT&#x27;s software has also been used by animal rights groups against organizations said to abuse animals. Electrohippies, another group of hacktivists, conducted Web sit-ins against the WTO when they met in Seattle in late 1999. These sit-ins all require mass participation to have much effect, and thus are more suited to use by activists than by terrorists.
* In 2000, a Japanese investigation revealed that the government was using software developed by computer companies affiliated with Aum Shinrikyo, the doomsday sect responsible for the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995. &quot;The government found 100 types of software programs used by at least 10 Japanese government agencies, including the Defense Ministry, and more than 80 major Japanese companies, including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.&quot; Following the discovery, the Japanese government suspended use of Aum-developed programs out of concern that Aum-related companies may have compromised security by breaching firewalls. gaining access to sensitive systems or information, allowing invasion by outsiders, planting viruses that could be set off later, or planting malicious code that could cripple computer systems and key data system.
* In March 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on a pattern of cyber attacks against U.S. financial institutions believed to be instigated by Iran as well as incidents affecting South Korean financial institutions that originate with the North Korean government.
* In August 2013, media companies including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Twitter and the Huffington Post lost control of some of their websites after hackers supporting the Syrian government breached the Australian Internet company that manages many major site addresses. The Syrian Electronic Army, a hacker group that has previously attacked media organisations that it considers hostile to the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, claimed credit for the Twitter and Huffington Post hacks in a series of Twitter messages. Electronic records showed that NYTimes.com, the only site with an hours-long outage, redirected visitors to a server controlled by the Syrian group before it went dark.
* Pakistani Cyber Army is the name taken by a group of hackers who are known for their defacement of websites, particularly Indian, Chinese, and Israeli companies and governmental organizations, claiming to represent Pakistani nationalist and Islamic interests. The group is thought to have been active since at least 2008, and maintains an active presence on social media, especially Facebook. Its members have claimed responsibility for the hijacking of websites belonging to Acer, BSNL, India&#x27;s CBI, Central Bank, and the State Government of Kerala.
*British hacker Kane Gamble, sentenced to 2 years in youth detention, posed as CIA chief to access highly sensitive information. He also &quot;cyber-terrorized&quot; high-profile U.S. intelligence officials such as then CIA chief John Brennan or Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The judge said Gamble engaged in &quot;politically motivated cyber terrorism&quot;.
*In March 2021 hackers affiliated with Russia were reported to have targeted Lithuanian Officials and decision makers. The cyber-espionage group APT29 which is believed to have carried out the attacks utilized the country&#x27;s own IT infrastructure against organizations involved in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.
*On 7 May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline was hit with a cyberattack that disrupted oil distribution. The Colonial Pipeline is a pipeline that controls almost half (45%) of the oil that runs through the East Coast of the United States. This attack caused the company to turn off the pipeline, which it had never done before. Thus, many people panicked buying gasoline at gas stations, and the government thought this attack would quickly spread. Ultimately, the Colonial Pipeline paid nearly an amount of 5 million dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Even though the Colonial paid all the money, the system did not turn on as rapidly as it used to. The hacker accused of this attack is a group called DarkSide. The money that the Colonial paid went to DarkSide, but there are other entities involved as well. For now, DarkSide has decided to discontinue its operations.
*On 30 May 2021, JBS was exposed to a cyberattack of ransomware which delayed the plant&#x27;s meat production. JBS is the world&#x27;s largest meat producer that provides meat-related products for people. This attack caused the shutdown of all nine beef factories in the United States and disrupted poultry and pork production. In addition, labor had to be cut due to the closings of the factories, and the cost of meat increased due to no meat being produced. Ultimately, JBS had to pay 11 million dollars worth of cryptocurrency to regain control. A group called REvil was responsible for the attack. REvil is a group based in the country of Russia that is also one of the most productive ransomware organizations.
* In the summer of 2021, crimes committed in Cyprus, Israel and Lithuania were classified by experts as Internet terrorism. Anonymous persons informed law enforcement authorities through the internet about mined business centers and office buildings. Main target was the gambling company Affise. According to Ambassador John R. Bolton, these occurrences are vivid examples of Internet terrorism. Amb. Bolton believes that they are consequences of financial conflict stirred among the owners of Affise, PlayCash and &quot;CyberEye-25&quot; group. According to the expert, all three companies gain illicit income associated with criminal activities on the Internet.
*In early December 2021 it was reported least nine U.S State Department had their phones hacked by an unknown attacker. All nine employees had Apple iPhones. The hack, which took place over several months, was done through the use of iMessages that had a software attached that when sent, without needing to be interacted with, installed spyware known as Pegasus. The software used was developed and sold by an Israel-based spyware development company named NSO Group.
*In December 2021 at least five US defense and tech firms have been hacked by a group operating from China. The group took advantage of an exploit used in these organization&#x27;s software to conduct their campaign which came to light in upcoming months. The target of these breaches were passwords as well as having the goal of intercepting private communications. As of right now the extent of the damage is unclear as the breaches are ongoing.

* As a response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Anonymous performed many attacks against computer systems in Russia. Most notably, Anonymous committed a cyberattack against Roskomnadzor in March 2022.

===Sabotage===
Non-political acts of sabotage have caused financial and other damage. In 2000, disgruntled employee Vitek Boden caused the release of 800,000 litres of untreated sewage into waterways in Maroochy Shire, Australia.

More recently, in May 2007 Estonia was subjected to a mass cyber-attack in the wake of the removal of a Russian World War II war memorial from downtown Tallinn. The attack was a distributed denial-of-service attack in which selected sites were bombarded with traffic to force them offline; nearly all Estonian government ministry networks as well as two major Estonian bank networks were knocked offline; in addition, the political party website of Estonia&#x27;s Prime Minister Andrus Ansip featured a counterfeit letter of apology from Ansip for removing the memorial statue. In January 2008 a man from Estonia was convicted for launching the attacks against the Estonian Reform Party website and fined.

During the Russo-Georgian War, on 5 August 2008, three days before Georgia launched its invasion of South Ossetia, the websites for OSInform News Agency and OSRadio were hacked. The OSinform website at osinform.ru kept its header and logo, but its content was replaced by a feed to the Alania TV website content. Alania TV, a Georgian government-supported television station aimed at audiences in South Ossetia, denied any involvement in the hacking of the websites. Dmitry Medoyev, at the time the South Ossetian envoy to Moscow, claimed that Georgia was attempting to cover up information on events which occurred in the lead-up to the war. One such cyber attack caused the Parliament of Georgia and Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites to be replaced by images comparing Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili to Adolf Hitler.
Other attacks involved denials of service to numerous Georgian and Azerbaijani websites, such as when Russian hackers allegedly disabled the servers of the Azerbaijani Day.Az news agency.

In June 2019, Russia has conceded that it is &quot;possible&quot; its electrical grid is under cyber-attack by the United States. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.

===Website defacement and denial of service===
Even more recently, in October 2007, the website of Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko was attacked by hackers. A radical Russian nationalist youth group, the Eurasian Youth Movement, claimed responsibility.

In 1999 hackers attacked NATO computers. The computers flooded them with email and hit them with a denial-of-service attack. The hackers were protesting against the NATO bombings of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Businesses, public organizations and academic institutions were bombarded with highly politicized emails containing viruses from other European countries.

In December 2018, Twitter warned of &quot;unusual activity&quot; from China and Saudi Arabia. A bug was detected in November that could have revealed the country code of users&#x27; phone numbers. Twitter said the bug could have had ties to &quot;state-sponsored actors&quot;.

In May 2021 successive waves of DDOS attacks aimed at Belnet, Belgium&#x27;s public sector ISP, took down multiple government sites in Belgium. 200 sites were affected leaving public offices, universities, and research centers unable to access the internet fully or partially.

==In fiction==

* The Japanese cyberpunk manga, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (as well as its popular movie and TV adaptations) centers around an anti-cyberterrorism and cybercrime unit. In its mid-21st century Japan setting such attacks are made all the more threatening by an even more widespread use of technology including cybernetic enhancements to the human body allowing people themselves to be direct targets of cyberterrorist attacks.
* In the movie &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;, John McClane (Bruce Willis) takes on a group of cyberterrorists intent on shutting down the entire computer network of the United States.
* The movie &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; involves a super computer controlling everything electrical and networked to accomplish the goal.
* The plots of &quot;24&quot; Day 4 and Day 7 include plans to breach the nation&#x27;s nuclear plant grid and then to seize control of the entire critical infrastructure protocol.
* The Tom Clancy created series Netforce was about an FBI/Military team dedicated to combating cyberterrorists.
* Much of the plot of &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; is centered around cyberterrorism.
* In the 2009 Japanese animated film &quot;Summer Wars&quot;, an artificial intelligence cyber-terrorist attempts to take control over the world&#x27;s missiles in order to &quot;win&quot; against the main characters that attempted to keep it from manipulating the world&#x27;s electronic devices.
* In the 2012 film Skyfall, part of the James Bond franchise, main villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) is an expert cyberterrorist who is responsible for various cyberterrorist incidents in the past.
* Cyberterrorism plays a role in the 2012 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;, first when main antagonist Raul Menendez cripples the Chinese economy with a cyberattack and frames the United States for it, starting a new Cold War between the two powers. Later, another cyberattack with a computer worm leads to Menendez seizing control of the entire U.S drone fleet. Finally, one of the game&#x27;s endings leads to another attack similar to the latter, this time crippling the U.S&#x27; electrical and water distribution grids. An alternate ending depicts the cyberattack failing after it is stopped by one of the game&#x27;s characters pivotal to the storyline.
* The plot of the 2014 video game &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; is heavily influenced by cyber-terrorism. In which players take control of the game&#x27;s protagonist, Aiden Pierce, an accused murder suspect, who hacks into a ctOS (Central Operating System), giving him complete control of Chicago&#x27;s mainframe in order to hunt down his accusers.
* In the television series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, the main plot line follows groups of hackers who engage in cyber terrorism as well as other events.

<text>The University of Arizona Global Campus (formerly Ashford University) is a public online university affiliated with the University of Arizona. The university announced a deal to acquire Ashford University in 2020 and completed the deal in 2023.

It is an open enrollment institution serving working adults and offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in more than 50 degree programs online. The university consists of five colleges and is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission.

==History==
===Mount St. Clare College/Franciscan University (of the Prairies) (1918–2005)===
Seeing a need for higher education in Clinton County, Iowa, and the surrounding area, the Sisters of Saint Francis founded Mount St. Clare College in 1918. This liberal arts institution was also an approved teacher education college from 1932 to 1954. In 1942, 60% of the rural teachers in Clinton County and 62% of the teachers in the city of Clinton school system had received all their training from Mount St. Clare College. In 1950, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools first accredited Mount St. Clare College. The college acquired a convent building, new library, new gymnasium, the Science Building, and Durham Residence Hall and became coeducational in 1967. The campus was about a half mile from the Mississippi River and about a mile north of U.S. Route 30. The most notable building on campus was St. Clare Hall, which served as the Mount St. Clare Convent, Novitiate, Academy, and College. Durham and Regis Halls provided residence to on campus students. For the 1979–1980 school year, the college received approval for its first four-year degree, a bachelor&#x27;s program in business administration. The same year, Mount St. Clare Academy merged with St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Clinton, forming Mater Dei High School (now known as Prince of Peace Preparatory). With the space freed by the academy&#x27;s merger, the school began to offer more four-year programs. In 1997, the sisters moved off campus into their new mother house, The Canticle. In 1998, the Durgin Educational Center was opened, which included new athletic facilities, including Kehl arena. In 2003, Mount St. Clare College changed its name to The Franciscan University. The university also offered its first master&#x27;s degree online. In September 2004, the school modified its name to The Franciscan University of the Prairies in order to avoid confusion with similarly named schools.

===Origin as TeleUniversity (1999–2001)===
University of Arizona Global Campus claims a history dating back to 1918, the founding year of Mount St. Clare College. The school, however, has stronger roots with TeleUniversity, an online school created by entrepreneur Michael K. Clifford in 1999.

===Charter Learning (2001–2003)===
In 2001, the company changed leadership with co-founders Wayne Clugston, Scott Turner, and David Vande Pol. TeleUniversity was renamed Charter Learning with a focus on helping working adults complete their bachelor&#x27;s degree while attending their community college. Charter Learning provided American Council on Education credit-recommended upper division curriculum in Organizational Management, the Maricopa Community College system provided the lower division coursework and instruction, and Charter Oak State College granted the degree. In 2003, Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, invested in Charter Learning and the name changed to Bridgepoint Education. In 2005, Bridgepoint Education purchased the small Franciscan University of the Prairies campus in Clinton, Iowa, retained the school&#x27;s valuable accreditation, and renamed it Ashford University. Most of Ashford University&#x27;s students, however, were enrolled to learn exclusively online and the campus closed in May 2016.

===Ashford University (2005–2020)===
====For-profit enrollment boom (2005–2012)====
Charter Learning acquired the financially failing Catholic college to gain regional accreditation and access to federal funds. After the sale, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to Ashford University. In 2010, Ashford University was highlighted in College, Inc., a PBS Frontline exposé about for-profit colleges. In June 2012, WASC denied initial accreditation to Ashford University. Following WASC&#x27;s denial of accreditation for being, according to &quot;Insider Higher Ed&quot;, &quot;lacking in several areas, including low numbers of full-time faculty, high student dropout rates and questions about academic rigor,&quot; WASC demanded additional information from Ashford prior to an October site visit. Its second application was accepted in 2013. In approving accreditation, the WASC Commission Action Letter stated &quot;The Commission found that the University has responded to Commission concerns and judges that it is now in substantial compliance with Commission standards.&quot; The WASC visiting team noted in its final report that &quot;the team found an institution that has been fundamentally transformed and whose culture has been changed in significant ways, including a shift from a market driven approach to an institution committed to student retention and success&quot;. At its meeting June 26–28, 2019, the WASC Senior College and University Commission acted to reaffirm Ashford&#x27;s accreditation through Spring 2025.

Academic organizations included the Ashford Junior-Senior Honor Society, the Ashford Student Iowa State Education Association, the Golden Key International Honour Society, the Mu Sigma Eta math and science honor society, the Phi Beta Lambda business organization, the Psychology Club, the Scholars Institute honors program, and the Sigma Tau Delta literature and education honor society. Campus students were eligible for the Ashford Junior-Senior Honor Society, the Scholars Institute, Mu Sigma Eta math and science honor society, and Sigma Tau Delta literature and education honor society.

The Ashford athletic teams were called the Saints. The university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2012–13 to 2015–16 (when the school closed). The Saints previously competed in the defunct Midwest Collegiate Conference (MCC) from 1988–89 to 2011–12.

Ashford competed in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

====Enrollment declines (2013–2020)====
In 2013, Ashford University announced an alliance with Forbes Media, and Ashford&#x27;s College of Business and Professional Studies was renamed the Forbes School of Business. It was later renamed Forbes School of Business &amp; Technology at Ashford University. On July 9, 2015, the university announced that the Iowa campus would close in May 2016. The inability to meet campus enrollment requirements was a key factor in the Ashford University Board of Trustees&#x27; decision to call for the campus closure.

In 2017, Ashford University school faced the potential loss of GI Bill funding as enrollment decreased more than 50 percent from its peak in 2011. Bridgepoint Education merged Ashford with the University of the Rockies and planned to convert Ashford to a non-profit university. In 2018, the university took steps to become a nonprofit institution. According to Nolan Sundrud, a Bridgepoint spokesman, the nonprofit status would allow the university to be &quot;...judged and measured as colleges and universities should be - on their ability to support student success.&quot; The switch required approval from both the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education. In November 2018, Ashford&#x27;s accreditor, WASC, delayed allowing the school to become a non-profit.

In 2019, Bridgepoint bought Fullstack Academy, and moved its personnel to Chandler, Arizona, boasting that its facility would feature an open working environment, with a café, gym, and on-site health clinic. Bridgepoint then rebranded and changed its name to Zovio. On April 14, 2019, Ashford University was featured in an NBC News investigation of for-profit colleges that were targeting military veterans. In June 2019, Zovio announced a mass layoff at its headquarters in San Diego. A month later, WASC approved Ashford to become a non-profit entity. Zovio faces shareholder lawsuits related to factual misstatements and an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. One such suit was dismissed by the California Superior Court on July 8, 2019, and a subsequent appeal was later dismissed with prejudice.

In October 2019, Zovio received a letter from the US Department of Education stating that it would be required to post an irrevocable letter of credit of 25 percent of the Title IV funding for fiscal year 2018 upon change of ownership. In February 2020, Zovio reported a net operating loss of $56.6 million in 2019. Enrollment declined from a peak of 77,734 in 2012 to 32,620 in 2019.

In March 2020, during the Coronavirus pandemic, Ashford&#x27;s parent company announced that it would be hiring 200 additional enrollment advisors. In 2020, Ashford received $1 million in federal Covid relief funds.
Ashford University Enrollment, 2005–2019

===University of Arizona Global Campus (2020–present)===
====Criticism of acquisition====
In August 2020, faculty members of University of Arizona&#x27;s Eller College of Management said the acquisition of Ashford University would &quot;impair the value of the University of Arizona, expose the University of Arizona to litigation, impede our ability to compete in the high-quality online space, and harm relationships with current and prospective donors and faculty.&quot;

Gary Rhoades, professor at the Center for the Study of Higher Education at University of Arizona and former general secretary of the American Association of University Professors said &quot;This is a sad example of public universities&#x27; &#x27;cynical academic capitalism,&#x27; grounded in white privilege and the exploitation of &#x27;others&#x27; who the public universities themselves have generally have largely underserved.&quot;

According to Dave Wells of the Grand Canyon Institute, &quot;Ashford is considered a predatory institution with a history of students dropping out or transferring with huge amounts of debt.&quot; As part of the transfer of ownership, University of Arizona Global had a service agreement with Zovio. According to the agreement, Arizona Global &quot;will pay to the Company services fees equal to the Company&#x27;s direct costs to provide the services plus an additional amount equal to 19.5% of Global Campus&#x27;s tuition and fees revenue&quot;. Zovio continued to lose more money as enrollment at the newly branded University of Arizona Global Campus declined. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, &quot;recent disclosures by Zovio also suggest enrollment struggles lie ahead for America&#x27;s newest mega-university, at least in the short term&quot;.

====Lawsuits and accreditation issues====

In 2021, the university&#x27;s parent company agreed to resolve an inquiry by the Massachusetts Attorney General&#x27;s Office through an Assurance of Discontinuance regarding Ashford University students. More specifically, the company agreed to pay the Massachusetts Attorney General $295,120 and to stop collecting written off balances that former Ashford University students in Massachusetts owed to the school. The university also received $564,001 from the American Rescue Plan. In July, UAGC&quot;s accreditor, WASC, notified the school that it had &quot;strong concerns that the targets set for academic improvement” at the school “are seriously inadequate to reach levels of student outcomes that should be expected at an accredited institution.” 

In December 2021, a California trial against Ashford University and Bridgepoint Education was underway. The California Attorney General alleged that Ashford University and Zovio engaged in &quot;unlawful business practices&quot;, providing &quot;false and misleading information to students to persuade them to enroll in the school&quot;, and &quot;illegal debt collection practices when students struggled to pay their bills.&quot;

In March 2022, WASC kept its notice of concern, noting the school&#x27;s low retention and graduation rates.

===Sale to the University of Arizona (2023)===
In 2020, it was announced that Ashford University would be sold by Zovio (formerly Bridgepoint Education), a for-profit higher education technology services company, to University of Arizona.

Even though it did not finalize the acquisition and assume control of the institution, Ashford University was renamed the University of Arizona Global Campus. Zovio continued as the campus&#x27;s online program manager until UAGC terminated its contract with Zovio in 2022. The acquisition was completed three years later.

On August 30, 2023, the Biden administration canceled $72 million of federal student loan debt for more than 2,300 borrowers who were enrolled at Ashford University in California between March 1, 2009, and April 30, 2020.

In 2023, University of Arizona faced a financial crisis, allegedly &quot;losing track of more than $240 million through accounting errors and flawed financial projections.&quot; Subsequent investigative reporting by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; linked much of the crisis to the university&#x27;s purchase of Ashford University, accusing university administrators of knowing that Ashford was experiencing &quot;a downward enrollment spiral that began years before [the purchase] and dismal graduation and retention rates&quot;.

In 2024, the US Department of Education discussed a claw back of funds related to borrower defense to repayment fraud claims against the school.

==Leadership==
The first president of University of Arizona Global Campus was Paul Pastorek, a former Superintendent of Louisiana Public Schools and an advocate for charter schools. Pastorek was removed in December 2023 amid financial difficulties.

No president has been named since the removal of Pastorek in December 2023. The interim Senior Vice Provost of Online Initiatives and current administrator overseeing UAGC is Gary Packard Jr.

==Funding and student aid==
The former Ashford University received approximately 95% of its money from the US federal government, including $41 million from military tuition assistance and $26 million from GI Bill funds. Ashford University partnered with more than 100 companies to offer tuition discounts and a limited number of full-tuition grants. Partner companies included T-Mobile, Bridgestone, Hewlett-Packard, Zurich Insurance Group, and Comcast. More than 1,000 students used the full tuition grant to get a degree at Ashford.

==Academics==
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2022 Ashford University employed 122 full-time faculty and 1,680 part-time faculty. The university consists of five colleges: Forbes School of Business and Technology, College of Education, College of Health, Human Services, and Science, College of Liberal Arts and Honors College.

==Student body==
University of Arizona Global&#x27;s undergraduate population is 43 percent white, 31 percent black, 16 percent Hispanic, 4 percent 2 or more races, and 2 percent Asian.

==Lawsuits and controversies==
===Audits, investigations, and lawsuits (2006–2011)===
According to U.S. Senate testimony by Arlie Willems, retired reviewer for the Iowa Department of Education, the Iowa Department of Education denied Ashford University&#x27;s request in 2006 to offer an online Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) on the grounds that the program &quot;was more a collection of discrete courses than a cohesive program, was understaffed for appropriate interaction with students and supervision of both courses and clinical experiences, including student teaching. Many faculty members lacked appropriate academic background and/or experiences for their assigned responsibilities. The most serious concern noted by the team was the lack of responsibility on the part of the program in providing quality clinical experiences, the aspect of teacher preparation considered the most important by preparation programs in Iowa.&quot;

Willems also testified that Ashford entered into partnership with Rio Salado Community College whereby education courses from the Ashford BA in Social Science with a Concentration in Education could apply to Rio Salado&#x27;s post-baccalaureate teacher education program. Once students have completed the online Ashford BA and the online Rio Salado teacher education program, they are eligible for an Arizona teaching license. Willem&#x27;s noted that this partnership could be seen as a creative way to solve a problem in order to continue drawing students, or it could be seen as a way to circumvent the accountability system for quality in order to continue collecting tuition from students. An individual who has attained an Arizona license in this way does not automatically receive an Iowa license because Iowa and Arizona do not have a reciprocity agreement.

According to Willems, complaints from Ashford students concerning this agreement and licensure include:

# Individuals from Iowa and many other states had completed Ashford&#x27;s online Bachelor of Arts in Social Science with a Concentration in Education. These individuals had been led to believe that, upon completion of this program, they would be eligible for a license in their home state because Ashford has a state-approved teacher education program (the on-ground undergraduate program).
# Individuals were students or graduates of the Ashford online baccalaureate program, but were not aware of the need to complete the Rio Salado program as well in order to receive an Arizona license. These individuals were not even aware of the Rio Salado partnership.
# Ashford students were intending to complete student teaching through Rio Salado College and believed they would then automatically be eligible for an Iowa teaching license.
# Students were completing an online degree through Ashford in early childhood education believed that this degree would lead to an Iowa teaching license. It does not.

In May 2008, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit services division commenced a compliance audit of Ashford University covering the period March 10, 2005, through June 30, 2009. The OIG audit reached the following conclusions:

The stock of Ashford&#x27;s parent company, Bridgepoint Education, fell the most in almost five months when the misuse of federal student aid was first publicly disclosed in 2009. When the official results were released in 2011, Senator Tom Harkin said this audit &quot;reveals the same troubling pattern of for-profit colleges&#x27; taking advantage of students and taxpayers.&quot; The Department of Education has not yet responded to the findings.

The audit was the subject of a U.S. Senate committee hearing on March 10, 2011.

A Bloomberg News report revealed that Ashford was recruiting disabled soldiers at the Wounded Warrior Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, including a Marine with a traumatic brain injury.

===2011 Iowa Attorney General investigation and US Senate hearings===
According to a February 15, 2011, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ashford University and its parent company, Bridgepoint Education, received a letter from the Iowa Attorney General&#x27;s office on February 9, 2011, requesting &quot;documents and detailed information&quot; from January 1, 2008, to the present to determine if Ashford&#x27;s business practices possibly violated the state&#x27;s Consumer Fraud Act.

On March 10, 2011, Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) chaired a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that examined a case study of Ashford&#x27;s parent company, which had experienced near-exponential profit growth in the last few years despite low graduation rates. Bridgepoint owns two universities that it purchased when both were near bankruptcy, Ashford University in Iowa and the University of the Rockies in Colorado. When it purchased Ashford University in 2005, it had fewer than 300 students but in 2010 it claimed to have over 78,000 students, 99% of which were online.

Harkin took issue with success of the company saying that while Bridgepoint may have had record profits the students were not succeeding. According to information provided by Harkin in the committee hearing, 63% of students who enrolled at Ashford University during the 2008–2009 school year withdrew before completion of their prospective program. Harkin pointed out that Bridgepoint recorded more than $216 million in profits in 2010; of which 86.5 percent of its revenues come from federal funds. In reference to the dependence of Bridgepoint on public funds, Harkin was quoted as saying, &quot;I think this is a scam, an absolute scam.&quot;

Kathleen Tighe, an inspector general with the U.S. Department of Education, testified at the hearing that in an audit of Ashford, she discovered Ashford was improperly distributing student aid to students. &quot;Seventy-five percent of the improper disbursements to students in our sample were made to students who never became eligible,&quot; Tighe said. Bridgepoint hadn&#x27;t returned the improperly obtained student aid to the federal government, and said on a recent report she&#x27;d seen that Bridgepoint was &quot;sitting on $130 million&quot; in these types of funds.

Due to the ongoing Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) proceedings, and in order to preserve due process, Ashford&#x27;s parent company, Bridgepoint Education, chose not to send executives to the HELP committee hearing while engaged in negotiations with FSA. Rather, Bridgepoint published a summary of responses called Bridgepoint Education Transparency.

===Audits, investigations, and lawsuits (2011–2021)===
In 2011, Ashford was audited by the U.S. Department of Education for its recruiting and finance practices. Bridgepoint Education responded with a report asserting that the information in the Senate hearing was inaccurate or incomplete.

On December 3, 2014, a suit was filed in Arizona federal court charging that Bridgepoint Education was violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by robocalling sales prospects. Similar suits were filed in federal court in San Diego and the Northern District of Ohio.

In 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that they were investigating Ashford University related to &#x27;&quot;unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans.&quot;&#x27;

In 2016, Bridgepoint Education received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the potential joint resolution of investigations by the California Attorney General and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2016, a former senior vice president at Ashford University alleged that Bridgepoint falsified its financial reports by inaccurately projecting the student retention rate. On September 12, 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Bridgepoint Education, the parent company of Ashford University, $31.5 million for deceiving students about the cost of private student loans; $23.5 million was targeted for relief and refunds to consumers. In 2016, the Iowa Department of Education notified Ashford that it would discontinue approval for GI Bill benefits after June 30.

In September 2017, the Department of Veterans Affairs accepted the shift in its state-based eligibility for veterans&#x27; benefits from Iowa to Arizona, but also stated in a letter that the VA has independent regulatory authority aside from the Arizona State Approving Agency. In September 2017, the VA gave Ashford approval to enroll GI Bill students indefinitely. Ashford University and its parent company Bridgepoint Education were the subject of an investigation published in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;. The article included information about Bridgepoint&#x27;s political moves with Arizona politicians in order to maintain GI Bill funding. In November 2017, the California Attorney General brought a lawsuit against Ashford and its parent company Bridgepoint for engaging in &quot;unlawful marketing, sales and debt collection practices&quot;.

In March 2019, Bridgepoint Education reported that it had made unreliable statements about its earnings and losses. The company estimated an operating loss of $13.6–14 million loss for the quarter ending in December 2018. Ashford University was featured in an NBC News Investigates piece that aired April 14, 2019. One recruiter, Eric Dean alleged that Ashford was targeting veterans with PTSD.

In November 2021, the California Attorney General case reached its trial phase. In March 2022, San Diego Superior Court issued that the parent company Zovio and its current rebranded online campus must pay $22 million in penalties for violating the laws by misleading students about career outcomes, college tuitions, financial aids, and degree programs. The court denied the company&#x27;s request to compensate students.

<text>Thomas Joel Bopp (October 15, 1949 – January 5, 2018) was an American amateur astronomer. In 1995, he discovered comet Hale–Bopp; Alan Hale discovered it independently at almost the same time, and it was thus named after both of them. At the time of the comet discovery he was a manager at a construction materials factory and an amateur astronomer. On the night of July 22, Bopp was observing the sky with friends in the Arizona desert when he made the discovery. It was the first comet he had observed and he was using a borrowed, home-built telescope.

==Early life and education==
Bopp was born October 15, 1949, in Denver, Colorado. The following year his family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio. It was there that, at the age of three, his father Frank Bopp introduced him to astronomy on the porch steps of the family home as they watched a meteor shower. Frank began to teach him about planets, constellations and the aurora borealis. At the age of ten he received his first telescope, a four-inch reflector.

Bopp attended Chaney High School and graduated in 1967. He joined the United States Air Force and served in the Philippines where several times he observed the green flash, an optical phenomenon which occurs just before sunset above the setting sun. After 18 months of service he was moved to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, where he met his wife-to-be Charlotte. He left the air force in 1972. The couple soon married and had a daughter, April.
Bopp then attended Youngstown State University and studied business administration. While attending the university, he had access to the physics and astronomy departments and took their classes as part of the elective elements of his education. It was here he met Yale University astrophysicist Dr. Edwin Bishop and Youngstown State emeritus professor of Astronomy Dr. Warren Young, who encouraged him to join the Mahoning Valley Astronomical Society (MVAS) in Warren, Ohio. He regularly attended meetings and became friends with astronaut Ronald A. Parise and enjoyed observing deep sky objects with the club&#x27;s 16&quot; Newtonian reflector telescope.

==Discovery of comet Hale–Bopp==

In 1980 Bopp moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to work in the parts department of a construction company and continued to attend astronomy clubs in the local area. He joined the North Phoenix Alternative Astronomical Society, an unofficial group of enthusiasts founded by Kevin Gill who met up to observe in the Arizona desert. Despite multiple attempts, prior to 1995, Bopp had never observed a comet. At this time Bopp was making use of a telescope belonging to close friend Jim Stevens, a 17.5-inch reflecting telescope. On the night of July 22, 1995, eight members of the club met at an undisclosed spot near Vekol Ranch, ninety miles south of Phoenix and as usual Stevens and Bopp were sharing time looking through Stevens&#x27;s telescope. Stevens had set up his newest home-built telescope and decided to look for globular clusters. Stevens lined up Messier 70 (M70) in the constellation Sagittarius and called Bopp over to look. At around 11 p.m. Bopp looked into the telescope and said, &quot;What&#x27;s this other object?&quot; Stevens replied, &quot;You might have something there, Tom.&quot; Bopp later described what he saw as &quot;a little fuzzy glow&quot; which he initially believed to be a galaxy. On the same night, professional astronomer and experienced comet observer Alan Hale had spotted the same thing at his home in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, while he was killing time waiting for Comet d&#x27;Arrest to appear. Bopp, on the other hand, had never seen a comet before. Bopp and his friends checked star charts and watched the object for an hour to determine whether it was moving. Bopp and another member of the group, Bertie Sanden, made drawings of its position in relation to other nearby dim stars and, on discovering the movement, Bopp attempted to contact the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams at the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the organization that records all astronomical sightings and names them, to officially log his findings. Discovering his cell phone had no coverage in the desert he drove towards home, stopping at a public payphone before realizing he did not have the phone number. At home again, Bopp finally reported the sighting by telegram to the IAU. Bopp had taken the institute&#x27;s name literally and sent a telegram via Western Union. Hale had already sent three emails with the comet&#x27;s coordinates.

Bopp later acknowledged the chance discovery

The following morning at 8:25 am the office of Brian Marsden, director of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, called him back to confirm the sighting was indeed a comet. The comet was given the formal name Comet 1995 O1, and three days later its full title C/1995 O1 (Hale–Bopp), designating the first comet found during the second half-month of July 1995. Hale&#x27;s name precedes Bopp&#x27;s because his was the first report to arrive. It is uncertain who was the first to discover it, as they both spotted it at around the same time. The following day Hale phoned Bopp to introduce himself with the words, &quot;I think that we have something in common.&quot; When they met at a conference two months later, Bopp said to the press that he was glad that Hale &quot;turned out to be a nice guy.&quot;

==After the discovery==

After the discovery, Bopp was in demand on television and radio, and was invited to speak at conferences. One such appearance was on the children&#x27;s science television show &quot;Bill Nye The Science Guy&quot;. On March 21, 1997, Hale and Bopp were named ABC Person of the Week in the Friday night broadcast. Bopp has said that &quot;I thought that it would be a comet that would be mentioned in the back of some obscure textbook somewhere, but it&#x27;s certainly not turned out to be that way.&quot; As Hale–Bopp became more visible, Bopp left his job and became a full-time speaker and educator. He enjoyed presenting in schools, science centers and museums, enthusing children with astronomy, and met up with his co-discoverer Hale in Queensland while taking a group of school children to see the 2012 eclipse in Australia.
At White Sands Missile Range in 1997 Bopp was invited to be an observer when an ultraviolet spectrograph was launched by Black Brant rocket to observe the comet and look for argon and neon. Previously unobserved isotopes were discovered in addition to a third sodium tail. Bopp was awarded an honorary doctor of Science degree from Youngstown State University in 1998. Bopp and his father also became the first two members of the Friends of Ward Beecher Planetarium at the university.

In 1997, as comet Hale–Bopp reached its brightest point, Bopp&#x27;s brother and sister-in-law were killed in a car accident after photographing the comet. &quot;This has been the best week of my life. And the worst,&quot; Bopp told a &quot;National Geographic&quot; reporter.
Bopp and his father Frank have had an asteroid named after them, (7086) Bopp, discovered October 5, 1991, by Carolyn and Gene Shoemaker. In 1997, the Shoemakers, both famous for co-discovering comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, were involved in a car crash. Gene died in the crash and his ashes were sent to the Moon along with an image of Comet Hale-Bopp, &quot;the last comet that the Shoemakers observed together.&quot;

In 1997, when Bopp pointed out the comet would soon disappear from view and would not be visible for another 2380 years, he said he would always continue looking up at the stars.

 He continued to volunteer at observatories near Phoenix, Arizona, towards the end of his life, speaking about Hale–Bopp. He died of liver failure on January 5, 2018, at the age of 68.

<text>Sium sisarum, commonly known as skirret, is a perennial plant of the family Apiaceae sometimes grown as a root vegetable. The English name skirret is derived from the Middle English &#x27;skirwhit&#x27; or &#x27;skirwort&#x27;, meaning &#x27;white root&#x27;. In Scotland it is known as &quot;crummock&quot; and in Irish &quot;cearrachán&quot;. Its Danish name &quot;sukkerrod&quot;, Dutch name &quot;suikerwortel&quot; and German name &quot;Zuckerwurzel&quot; translate as &#x27;sugar root&#x27;.

Skirret has a cluster of bright white, sweetish, somewhat aromatic roots, each approximately in length. These are used as a vegetable in the same manner as the common salsify, black salsify and the parsnip.

==History==

The plant is of Chinese origin, but had arrived in Europe by Roman times. It is presumed to be the &quot;siser&quot; mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a favourite of the Emperor Tiberius, though this may have also been a reference to a parsnip or carrot.

The twelfth-century Benedictine abbess Hildegard von Bingen discussed the medicinal properties of skirret in her work &quot;Physica&quot;:

: Skirret (gerla) is hot and dry. Eaten in moderation, it is not very helpful or harmful. If someone should eat a lot of it, its heat and dryness would stir up fevers in him and harm his intestines. A person whose face has weak skin, which easily splits, should pound skirret in a mortar and add oil. When he goes to bed at night, he should rub it on his face, continuing until he is healed.

A 1390 manuscript The Forme of Cury used by King Richard II of England&#x27;s master cooks included two recipes for fritters that included &#x27;skyrwates&#x27;.

Cookery books in the 14th century instruct cooks to fry skirrets in oil or butter.

Maud Grieve in &quot;A Modern Herbal&quot; mentions that it has been cultivated in Great Britain since 1548 and is supposed to be a useful diet in chest complaints.
The seventeenth-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper said about the plant:

: &quot;Sisari, secacul. &quot; Of Scirrets. They are hot and moist, of good nourishment, something windy, as all roots are; by reason of which, they provoke venery, they stir up appetite, and provoke urine.

John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball or General Historie of Plantes&quot; of 1633 describes skirret thus:

: Sisarum. Skirrets. The roots of the Skirret be moderately hot and moist; they be easily concocted; they nourish meanly, and yeeld a reasonable good iuice: but they are something windie, by reason whereof they also prouoke lust. They be eaten boiled, with vineger, salt, and a little oile, after the manner of a sallad, and oftentimes they be fried in oile and butter, and also dressed after other fashions, according to the skill of the cooke, and the taste of the eater...

When boiled and served with butter, the roots form a dish, declared by the seventeenth-century agriculturist John Worlidge in 1682, to be &quot;the sweetest, whitest, and most pleasant of roots&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Skirret grows about high and is very resistant to cold, as well as pests and diseases. It can be grown from seeds, but may also be started from root divisions. The roots are best eaten when the plant is dormant during the winter, as in the spring, the roots become woody and covered with small hairs. Lack of moisture can also make the root more fibrous. The plant prefers sandy and moist soil.

==Culinary use==
The roots are scrubbed, cut into lengths, boiled, and served like parsnips or carrots. Skirret roots can be stewed, baked, roasted, fried in batter as fritter, or creamed, and also be grated and used raw in salads. A woody core may be present in some roots, though this seems to be variable in different plants. If present, it should be removed before cooking because it is difficult to remove after.

<text>The Pioneer Fund is an American non-profit foundation established in 1937 &quot;to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences&quot;. The organization has been described as racist and white supremacist in nature. The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the Pioneer Fund as a hate group. One of its first projects was to fund the distribution in US churches and schools of &quot;Erbkrank&quot;, a Nazi propaganda film about eugenics.

From 2002 until his death in October 2012, the Pioneer Fund was headed by psychology professor J. Philippe Rushton, who was succeeded by Richard Lynn. After Lynn&#x27;s death in 2023, much of the activity of the Pioneer Fund shifted to the Human Diversity Foundation.

Two of the best known studies funded by Pioneer Fund are the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart and the Texas Adoption Project, which studied the similarities and differences of identical twins and other children adopted into non-biological families.

Research backed by the fund on race and intelligence has generated controversy and criticism. One prominent example is the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, which drew heavily from Pioneer-funded research. The fund also has ties to eugenics, and has both current and former links to white supremacist publications such as &quot;American Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;.

==History==

Pioneer Fund was incorporated on March 11, 1937. The incorporation documents of the Pioneer Fund list two purposes. The first, modeled on the Nazi Lebensborn breeding program, was aimed at encouraging the propagation of those &quot;descended predominantly from white persons who settled in the original thirteen states prior to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States and/or from related stocks, or to classes of children, the majority of whom are deemed to be so descended&quot;. Its second purpose was to support academic research and the &quot;dissemination of information, into the &#x27;problem of heredity and eugenics and &quot;the problems of race betterment&quot;. The Pioneer Fund argues the &quot;race betterment&quot; has always referred to the &quot;human race&quot; referred to earlier in the sentence, and critics argue it referred to racial groups. The document was amended in 1985 and the phrase changed to &quot;human race betterment.&quot;

The first five directors were Wickliffe Preston Draper, Harry Laughlin, Frederick Osborn, Malcolm Donald and John Marshall Harlan II.

===Wickliffe Preston Draper===

Wickliffe Preston Draper, the fund&#x27;s final authority, served on the board of directors from 1937 until 1972. He founded Pioneer Fund after having acquired an interest in the Eugenics movement, which was strengthened by his 1935 visit to Nazi Germany, where he met with the leading eugenicists of the Third Reich who used the inspiration from the American movement as a basis for the Nuremberg Laws. He served in the British army at the beginning of World War I, transferring to the US Army as the Americans entered the war. During World War II, he was stationed as an intelligence officer in India.

Draper secretly met C. Nash Herndon of Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in 1949. Little is known about their meetings, but Herndon was playing a major role in the expansion of the compulsory sterilization program in North Carolina.

Psychology professor William H. Tucker describes Draper as someone who &quot;aside from his brief periods of military service ... never pursued a profession or held a job of any kind.&quot; According to a 1960 article in &quot;The Nation&quot;, an unnamed geneticist said Draper told him he &quot;wished to prove simply that Negroes were inferior.&quot; Draper funded advocacy of repatriation of black people to Africa.

===Founding members===

Harry Laughlin was the director of the Eugenics Record Office at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York. He served as the president of Pioneer Fund from its inception until 1941. He opposed miscegenation and had proposed a research agenda to assist in the enforcement of Southern &quot;race integrity laws&quot; by developing techniques for identifying the &quot;pass-for-white&quot; person who might &quot;successfully hide all of his black blood&quot;. He singled out Jews and fought efforts to allow entry into the United States to Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany. Eleven months after the enactment of the Nuremberg Laws, Laughlin wrote to an official at the University of Heidelberg (which had awarded him an honorary doctorate) that the United States and the Third Reich shared &quot;a common understanding of ... the practical application&quot; of eugenic principles to &quot;racial endowments and ... racial health.&quot;

Frederick Osborn wrote in 1937 that the Nazi Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring was &quot;the most exciting experiment that had ever been tried&quot;. Osborn was the secretary of the American Eugenics Society, which was part of an accepted and active field at the time; the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Selective Service during World War II; and later the deputy US representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission.

Malcolm Donald was the Draper family lawyer and trustee of the Draper estate. He was a former editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and a brigadier general during World War II.

John Marshall Harlan II, whose firm had done legal work for the Pioneer Fund. He was the only director whose name did not appear on the incorporation papers. He was director of operational analysis for the Eighth Air Force in World War II, and was appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He voted for the decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as a member of the Supreme Court and his grandfather was the only dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, reversed by the decision. He dissented in &quot;Swain v. Alabama&quot; and &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;.

===History after 1946===
Corporate lawyer Harry F. Weyher Jr. was president of the Pioneer Fund from 1958 until his death in 2002.

Following Jesse Helms&#x27;s 1984 Senate re-election bid, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; journalists Thomas B. Edsall and David A. Vise reported that both Helms and Thomas F. Ellis were linked to the Pioneer Fund, which was described as having &quot;financed research into &#x27;racial betterment&#x27; by scientists seeking to prove that blacks are genetically inferior to whites.&quot;

Later directors included Marion A. Parrott (1973–2000), J. Philippe Rushton, Richard Lynn and Gerhard Meisenberg (as of 2019).

Rushton, who headed Pioneer until 2012, spoke at conferences of the &quot;American Renaissance&quot; (AR) magazine, in which he has also published articles. Anti-racist &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine described one such AR conference as a &quot;veritable &#x27;who&#x27;s who&#x27; of American white supremacy.&quot;

In October 2024, UK anti-racist group Hope not Hate reported that the Pioneer Fund had rebranded as the Human Diversity Foundation.

==Political, publishing and legal funding==

The Pioneer Fund was described by the London &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; (March 12, 1989) as a &quot;neo-Nazi organization closely integrated with the far right in American politics.&quot;

The Pioneer Fund supported the distribution of a eugenics film titled &quot;Erbkrank&quot; (&quot;Hereditary Defective&quot; or &quot;Hereditary Illness&quot;) which was published by the pre-war 1930s Nazi Party. William Draper obtained the film from the predecessor to the Nazi Office of Racial Policy (&quot;Rassenpolitisches Amt&quot;) prior to the founding of the Pioneer Fund. According to the Pioneer Fund site, all founders capable of doing so participated in the war against the Nazis.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the fund supported two government committees that gave grants for both anti-immigration and genetics research. The committee members included Representative Francis E. Walter (chair of the House Un-American Activities Committee and head of the Draper Immigration Committee), Henry E. Garrett (a White Citizens Council member and educator known for his belief in the genetic inferiority of blacks), and Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi, head of the Draper Genetics Committee. Draper also made large financial contributions to efforts to oppose the American Civil Rights Movement and the racial desegregation mandated by &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; such as $215,000 to the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in 1963.

As of 1994, the Pioneer Fund distributed more than $1 million per year to academics. Hampton University sociology professor Steven J. Rosenthal described the fund in 1995 as a &quot;Nazi endowment specializing in production of justifications for eugenics since 1937, the Pioneer Fund is embedded in a network of right-wing foundations, think tanks, religious fundamentalists, and global anti-Communist coalitions&quot;.

In 2002, William H. Tucker criticized the fund&#x27;s grant-funding techniques:
In accord with the tax regulations governing nonprofit corporations, Pioneer does not fund individuals; under the law only other nonprofit organizations are appropriate grantees. As a consequence, many of the fund&#x27;s awards go not to the researchers themselves but to the universities that employ them, a standard procedure for supporting work by scientists affiliated to academic institutions. In addition to these awards to the universities where its grantees are based, Pioneer has made a number of grants to other nonprofit organizations and corporations that have been created to channel resources to a particular academic recipient while circumventing the institution where the researcher is employed.

The Southern Poverty Law Center listed the Pioneer Fund as a hate group in 2003, citing the fund&#x27;s history, its funding of race and intelligence research, and its connections with racist individuals.

In 2006, the Center for New Community, a human rights advocacy organization, characterize the Pioneer Fund as &quot;a white supremacist foundation that specializes in funding &#x27;science&#x27; dedicated to demonstrating white intellectual and moral superiority.&quot; They draw particular attention to Rushton&#x27;s theories about differences between races as evidence of the racial slant which they claim accompanies much of the research which is backed by the Fund.

==Recipients of funding==

Pioneer Fund&#x27;s figures are from 1971 to 1996 and are adjusted to 1997 USD.

Many of the researchers whose findings support the hereditarian hypothesis of racial IQ disparity have received grants of varying sizes from the Pioneer Fund. Large grantees, in order of amount received, are:
* Thomas J. Bouchard at the University of Minnesota.
* Arthur Jensen at the University of California, Berkeley ($1,096,094 as of 1994).
* J. Philippe Rushton at the University of Western Ontario was head of the fund from 2002 to his death in 2012. In 1999, Rushton used some of his grant money from the Pioneer Fund to send out tens of thousands of copies of an abridged version of his book &quot;Race, Evolution and Behavior&quot; to social scientists in anthropology, psychology, and sociology, causing a controversy. Tax records from 2000 show that his Charles Darwin Institute received $473,835 – 73% of that year&#x27;s grants.
* Roger Pearson at the Institute for the Study of Man: eugenicist and anthropologist, founder of the &quot;Journal of Indo-European Studies&quot;, received over a million dollars in grants in the 1980s and 1990s. Using the pseudonym of Stephan Langton, Pearson was the editor of &quot;The New Patriot&quot;, a short-lived magazine published in 1966–67 to conduct &quot;a responsible but penetrating inquiry into every aspect of the Jewish Question&quot;, which included articles such as &quot;Zionists and the Plot Against South Africa&quot;, &quot;Early Jews and the Rise of Jewish Money Power&quot;, and &quot;Swindlers of the Crematoria&quot;. The Northern League, an organization founded in England in 1958 by Pearson, supported Nazi ideologies and included former members of the Nazi Party.
* Michael Levin of the City College of New York ($124,500 as of 1994)
* Richard Lynn at Ulster Institute for Social Research ($325,000 as of 1994)
* Linda Gottfredson at the University of Delaware ($267,000 as of 1994)
Other notable recipients of funding include:
* Hans Eysenck, the most-cited living psychologist at the time of his death (1997), known for fraudulent work financed by the tobacco industry, and also believing in parapsychology and astrology.
* Lloyd Humphreys
* Joseph M. Horn
* Robert A. Gordon ($214,000 as of 1994)
* Garrett Hardin, author who in 1968 re-popularized the 1833 phrase &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; ($29,000 as of 1994)
* R. Travis Osborne ($386,900 as of 1994)
* Audrey M. Shuey, author of &quot;The Testing of Negro Intelligence&quot; (1958)
* Philip A. Vernon
* William Shockley, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956, received a series of grants in the 1970s. Shockley had become notorious in his later career for promoting the controversial genetic hypothesis of racial intelligence differences and for being a proponent of eugenics. ($188,900)
* Aurelio José Figueredo, as of 2018, the only academic researcher receiving funding from the Pioneer Fund. According to the Associated Press, from 2003 to 2016 Figueredo received $458,000. Figueredo received between $8,000 and $30,000 for the 2017–2018 academic year, his research assistant Michael Woodley is also involved with the Pioneer Fund.
*Seymour Itzkoff: the Pioneer Fund approved a $12,000 grant to Smith College &quot;to assist in the publication of a series of educational books&quot;, in support of Itzkoff&#x27;s &quot;Evolution of Intelligence&quot; series. It also approved a $12,000 grant to be distributed in 1987 to assist in the publication of the series.

The fund gave the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) a total of $1.3 million between 1985 and 1994. Among the grants was $150,000 for &quot;studies in connection with immigration policies&quot;. Funding was dropped after negative publicity during the campaign for California&#x27;s Proposition 187 linked the Pioneer Fund to ads purchased by FAIR. Other immigration reduction groups that have received donations from the Pioneer Fund include ProjectUSA and American Immigration Control Foundation.

One of the grantees is the paleoconservative and white supremacist journalist Jared Taylor, the editor of &quot;American Renaissance&quot; and a member the advisory board of the white nationalist publication &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;. Another is Roger Pearson&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Man. Many of the key academic white nationalists in both &quot;Right Now!&quot; and &quot;American Renaissance&quot; have been funded by the Pioneer Fund, which was also directly involved in funding the parent organization of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, the New Century Foundation.

Founder Wickliffe Draper secretly funded the 1960 launch of &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, to clandestinely serve as a publishing arm for its segregationist founders.

<text>Winnipeg Stadium (also known as Canad Inns Stadium) was a multipurpose stadium in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

The stadium was located at the corner of St. James Street and Maroons Road, immediately north of the Polo Park Shopping Centre and the now-defunct Winnipeg Arena. Although built for the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, the stadium also accommodated baseball and soccer, and was used by various iterations of the Winnipeg Goldeyes and Winnipeg Whips. The stadium was demolished after the Blue Bombers moved to the venue then-known as IG Field in 2013.

== History ==
During the Blue Bombers&#x27; early years, the team played at Osborne Stadium, a much smaller venue located near the Manitoba Legislative Buildings. The fast passing-dominated play of Bombers quarterback Jack Jacobs dramatically increased attendance at Blue Bombers games and precipitated the need for a new, larger stadium.

In the wake of several unsuccessful proposals for a new stadium, Winnipeg Enterprises Corporation, a newly created non-profit organization led by Winnipeg Football Club president Culver Riley, presented a plan for the construction of a new 15,700 seat stadium in the Polo Park district. The plan was approved by the City of Winnipeg in August 1952. Winnipeg Stadium was officially opened on August 14, 1953, with a fundraising gala to benefit the Winnipeg Unit of the Shriners Hospitals for Children. Foster Hewitt served as the master of ceremonies as 12,000 spectators watched an array of Shriners, athletes, politicians, and Hollywood actress Corinne Calvet inaugurate the stadium. The following night, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers played the first football game at the new facility against the Ottawa Rough Riders. The stadium became known as &quot;the house that Jack built&quot; in recognition of the contributions of Jack Jacobs.

The on-field success of the Blue Bombers and their growing fan base led to numerous expansions of the facility beginning in 1954, when capacity was raised to 17,995. Of those seats, only 10,166 were on permanent concrete grandstands, with the remainder being temporary seating in the stadium corners. Further additions included the construction of new north end-zone seating in 1966 and expansion of the west side grandstands, including a new upper deck, in 1972. In 1978, the east side grandstands were expanded, with a new upper deck, raising capacity to 32,946. Seats were also added in 1987 when the stadium was configured to accommodate baseball, at which point its capacity peaked at 33,675.

AstroTurf was installed in time for the 1988 season (when it was installed, the Edmonton Eskimos became the last CFL team to have a natural grass surface, but it would switch to a next-generation artificial surface in 2010), which the team welcomed with a Grey Cup victory that year at Lansdowne Park in Ottawa. In 1999, the lower deck benches were replaced by theatre-style seats, the press boxes were enlarged, and a club lounge was added. As a result, seating capacity was reduced to 29,533 and remained that way until the stadium&#x27;s closure. The artificial turf was replaced by a next-generation AstroPlay surface in 2003.

Winnipeg-based hotel chain Canad Inns acquired the naming rights to Winnipeg Stadium in 2001, after which the facility became known as Canad Inns Stadium. In 2004, Winnipeg Enterprises Corporation was dissolved and operation of the facility was turned over to the Winnipeg Football Club.

== Baseball ==
The original baseball grandstands were built in 1954, at a cost of $184,000, and located in the southwest corner of the complex. The grandstands housed the original incarnation of the Winnipeg Goldeyes and the Winnipeg Whips, the Class AAA affiliate of the Montreal Expos. The grandstands were demolished in the early 1980s to make way for the Blue and Gold Room and, for nearly a decade, baseball could not be accommodated at the stadium.

The stadium once again became a multi-sport venue in the late 1980s. Artificial turf, retractable seats on the east side stands, and new seating behind the home plate area (the northwest corner of the football field) were installed in an effort to attract another professional baseball team to Winnipeg. Although official minor league baseball never returned to the city, the new Winnipeg Goldeyes, an independent team, began play at the stadium in 1994. The Goldeyes played five seasons at the stadium, which included a Northern League championship in 1994 and an independent baseball single-game attendance record of 22,081 set in 1997. The Goldeyes moved into their own ballpark in 1999, which marked the end of baseball at Winnipeg Stadium.

== Major events ==
The stadium hosted the opening ceremonies of both the 1967 and 1999 Pan-American Games. The 1967 Games saw the construction of new north end zone seating. The 1999 Games saw several improvements in preparation for the event, including new seats to replace old benches, additional media and club seating facilities, improved lighting and sound, and a new Sony JumboTron scoreboard.

The CFL&#x27;s championship game, the Grey Cup, was held at the stadium in 1991, 1998, and 2006. In each instance, temporary seating was installed to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity. The stadium&#x27;s attendance record for football was set at the 1991 game, when 51,985 fans watched the Toronto Argonauts defeat the Calgary Stampeders. For the 2006 game, temporary seats were erected at the south end of the football field, raising the Stadium&#x27;s capacity to 44,784.

The stadium also hosted numerous outdoor concerts, including big-name acts such as The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, AC/DC, Bon Jovi, the Eagles and U2. Many outdoor music festivals, such as Festival Express, Edgefest and Rock on the Range, were also held at the stadium.

== Closure ==
Increasing maintenance costs and the accidental death of a fan during a football game in 2006 intensified discussions on the future of Canad Inns Stadium. By 2009, it was estimated that the aging stadium would require over $52 million in upgrades as early as 2012 in order to make it safe and viable for another decade. Faced with the decision on whether to refurbish the old stadium or replace it, the Manitoba government fast-tracked financing for a new stadium. In 2010, Premier Greg Selinger, together with the Winnipeg Football Club and the University of Manitoba, unveiled plans to build $190 million Investors Group Field on the university campus in south Winnipeg. The stadium was slated to be completed in time for the 2012 CFL season, after which Canad Inns Stadium would be demolished.

In anticipation of the scheduled move to Investors Group Field, the Blue Bombers held a special ceremony to close out Canad Inns Stadium prior to their last regular season game of 2011. However, as construction delays at the new stadium pushed back its opening date by several months, the team was forced to return to Canad Inns Stadium for the 2012 season. The Blue Bombers played their final game at the stadium on November 3, 2012, defeating the Montreal Alouettes 19–11. The football club officially closed its offices at Canad Inns Stadium on January 3, 2013.

=== Demolition ===
In June 2012, the city announced the proposed sale of the stadium to Polo Park Holdings Inc, owner of the nearby Polo Park shopping centre, for $30.25 million. The sale was finalized in April 2013 and demolition began soon after. The stadium was dismantled piece-by-piece over a period of four months, beginning with the north end zone and west side grandstands.

Fans had the opportunity to purchase memorabilia from the old stadium prior to its demolition, including seats, pieces of turf, and other equipment not moved to Investors Group Field. Other fixtures, such as stadium benches, were donated to local community clubs and sports teams.

The site is currently being developed into a retail and commercial park known as &quot;The Plaza at Polo Park&quot;. Demolition of the stadium has also permitted the city to connect two segments of Milt Stegall Drive (formerly Arena Road) which were separated by the stadium.

<text>Alan Hale (born 1958) is an American professional astronomer, who co-discovered Comet Hale–Bopp along with amateur astronomer Thomas Bopp.

Hale specializes in the study of Sun-like stars and the search for extra-solar planetary systems, and has side interests in the fields of comets and near-Earth asteroids. He has been an active astronomer most of his life and currently serves as the president of the Earthrise Institute, which he founded, and which has as its mission the use of astronomy as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has named an asteroid in Hale&#x27;s honor, 4151 Alanhale, in recognition of his numerous comet observations.

==Early life and career==
Hale was born in 1958 in Tachikawa, Japan, where his father was serving in the United States Air Force. Four months later his father was transferred to Holloman Air Force Base outside Alamogordo, New Mexico.

Hale was raised in Alamogordo where his father retired from the Air Force and worked in civil service. In 2013 Hale said, &quot;I refuse to say that &#x27;I grew up there&#x27; because anyone who know me knows that I really haven’t grown up yet.&quot;
He credits several factors for inspiring his interest in science and astronomy in the 1960s: the clear night skies in Alamogordo, library books on astronomy his father gave him in the first grade, the US space program, and the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series. Hale also said that as a child he was interested in other sciences as well, and he &quot;went through a dinosaur phase when I was in 2nd grade. I knew them all. Drove my parent nuts.&quot;
Hale graduated from Alamogordo High School in 1976, and then served in the United States Navy from 1976 to 1983. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1980 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics.
Following his Navy service he worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) until 1986 as an engineering contractor for Allied Bendix Aerospace working on the Deep Space Network project, as well as on several spacecraft projects. During the 1986 Voyager 2 fly-by of Uranus, he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft carrier signal to deduce information about Uranus&#x27; atmosphere and rings.

After leaving the JPL, Hale enrolled in the astronomy department of New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, where he earned a Master&#x27;s Degree and a PhD in 1989 and 1992 respectively, both in astronomy. His doctoral dissertation was published in the January 1994 issue of &quot;The Astronomical Journal&quot;.
After completing his studies at the New Mexico State University, Hale worked at the New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo as its staff astronomer and outreach education coordinator.

==Earthrise Institute==
In 1993 Hale founded the Southwest Institute for Space Research (SWISR), which later became the Earthrise Institute, where Hale serves as president.

Hale said &quot;there is an entire generation that has come of age having never really seen the dark sky&quot;, so part of what he wanted to accomplish with Earthrise was &quot;to create an environment where students could spend some nights out under a dark sky and see what it really looks like.&quot;

In 1999 Hale assembled a group of American scientists, students and educators to go on a 2 week+ trip to Iran (coinciding with a solar eclipse) where they gave talks throughout the country. Hale feels that &quot;Science is a... universal language&quot; and &quot;it would be a great idea if we could use science as a tool to bring people together... to break down barriers between nations and between cultures.&quot; Hale uses the expression &#x27;Science Diplomacy&#x27; in this context, which he says it&#x27;s possible he coined. &quot;The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US. It’s the same sky we study... Science does not know political boundaries.&quot;

This sentiment is reflected in the mission of his Earthrise Institute, which is &quot;to use astronomy, space, and other related endeavors as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers and for bringing humanity together.&quot; Earthrise&#x27;s inaugural educational project was announced in a press release on March 1, 2007:
Hale remains active with the Earthrise Institute performing science outreach. For example, his &quot;In Our Skies&quot; column appears in the &quot;Alamogordo Daily News&quot;, in which he discusses current astronomical issues.

In 2019, Hale announced he was authoring a weekly educational series about the &quot;small bodies&quot; of the Solar System. The series, titled Ice and Stone 2020, features three presentations about comets and asteroids – This Week in History, Comet of the week, and a Special Topic – being released each week throughout 2020. Ice and Stone 2020 is available for free online at the websites of both the Earthrise Institute and RocketSTEM.

==Discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp==

Hale first spotted the comet that would come to bear his name from his home in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where the night sky is exceptionally dark. Since 1970 Hale had observed over 200 known comets, and on the night of July 22–23, 1995, after finishing his observations of periodic Comet Clark, and while waiting for periodic Comet d&#x27;Arrest to become visible above the horizon, he &quot;decided to pass the time by observing some deep-sky objects in Sagittarius&quot;, and pointed his Meade DS-16 telescope towards globular cluster M70. He said that he &quot;immediately noticed a fuzzy object in the field&quot; which had not been present when he had observed that region of the sky two weeks earlier.
After consulting his astronomical sources, and determining that the comet was likely unknown, Hale says: 
Unknown to Hale, that night Thomas Bopp was observing the same region of the sky with friends near Stanfield, Arizona. At around 11:00 pm, Bopp was observing M70 through his telescope and &quot;noticed a fainter, fuzzy object coming into the field&quot;. Bopp and his friends determined that it was a comet, and after Bopp returned home he informed Central Bureau of his discovery.
On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to announce the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared on the order of 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to the inner Solar System until approximately 4385.

Comet Hale–Bopp, originally labeled C/1995 O1, and sometimes called &quot;the Great Comet of 1997&quot;, became one of the most-viewed comets in human history, and the brightest comet seen since Comet West in 1976, appearing &quot;1000 times brighter than Comet Halley did at the same distance.&quot;

When the comet was at the peak of its brightness, Hale says he was giving talks about the comet in big cities with light-polluted night skies, so he did not get a chance &quot;to see it all that much when it was really bright.&quot;

Regarding the press conference of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the reporting done by “the very first reporter that broke the story of the comet’s discovery,” the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; science reporter John Fleck:

As an example of the media getting it wrong, Hale told this story:
==Heaven&#x27;s Gate reaction==
Historically linked to the discovery and first recorded appearance of Hale–Bopp is Heaven&#x27;s Gate, a religious cult in San Diego led by Marshall Applewhite who preached that an alien spacecraft was following Comet Hale–Bopp. The cult members believed that transporting their souls to the spacecraft and evacuating the Earth – which was soon to be &quot;recycled&quot; – would permit them to achieve salvation. Applewhite and 38 followers poisoned themselves over three days in March 1997 in the belief this would allow them to pass through &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and achieve &quot;the Evolutionary Level Above Human.&quot; The rationale for taking their lives was (and is, as of this writing) clearly detailed on the group&#x27;s website which is maintained by surviving cult members.

When news broke of the Heaven&#x27;s Gate mass suicides and their relation to Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale&#x27;s phone &quot;never stopped ringing the entire day.&quot; Hale did not respond until the next day, when he spoke at a press conference on the subject, only after he had researched details of the incident.

At the 20th annual convention of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) in Tampa, Florida, in 1997 Hale was a featured speaker and discussed the suicides, calling their death pact and other religion-fostered violence &quot;another victory for ignorance and superstition.&quot;

Speaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in Heidelberg, Germany on July 24, 1998:
Hale said that, well before Heaven&#x27;s Gate, he had told a colleague:
==Media appearances==
Following his discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale was in demand to speak about the comet bearing his name, and this gave him a platform to discuss Hale-Bopp as well as general astronomy and science. Hale was a guest speaker at the February 16, 1996, meeting of New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) which according to member and &quot;Science Watch&quot; host Dave Thomas &quot;was one of our most memorable and well-attended ever.&quot; Hale spoke on &quot;Comet Hale–Bopp: Potentials and Opportunities&quot; and cautioned against complacency about asteroid and comet impacts on the Earth, saying that:
On February 26, 1997, Hale was the guest speaker for two public lectures sponsored by the Center for Particle Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. Hale has been a periodic guest on &quot;The Space Show&quot;, an Internet radio talk show centering on space commerce and exploration, which is also available as a podcast. On the March 19, 2002, broadcast, Hale spoke of the importance of the search for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and their danger to civilization:
From 2004 to 2006 Hale was host of a weekly radio program, &quot;The Other Side of the Sky&quot; (the precursor to &quot;Earthrise Radio&quot;). On March 11, 2006, Hale was interviewed on the NMSR&#x27;s &quot;Science Watch&quot; radio show in an episode called &quot;An Hour-long visit with Dr. Alan Hale, co-discoverer of the Hale–Bopp Comet!&quot;

==Scientific skepticism advocacy==
As a scientific skeptic, Hale is a periodic contributor to &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine. One such article, titled &quot;An Astronomer’s Personal Statement on UFOs&quot;, appeared in the March/April 1997 edition. In the article Hale stated:
After an analysis of the claims of extraterrestrial visitation with regards to these three principles, Hale concluded: 
==Atheist activism==
Hale is an atheist and member of the honorary board of the online group Internet Infidels which has the mission of using the Internet to promote a view that supernatural forces or entities do not exist. Hale has made his position on religion clear:
==Awards and honors==
In 1980 Alan Hale was awarded the Navy League of the United States prize in Applied Physics.

In 1991, years prior to his discovery of Hale–Bopp, the IAU named an asteroid, 4151 Alanhale, in Hale&#x27;s honor in recognition of his numerous comet observations, stating that:

<text>The Hope Valley is a rural area centred on the village of Hope, Derbyshire, in the Peak District in the northern Midlands of England.

The name also applies to the post town that includes the surrounding villages.

==Valley==
Although the Hope Valley appears to be a single valley, the name of the river changes several times. The head of the valley lies below Mam Tor at Castleton, widely regarded as the capital of the valley. From here, the Peakshole Water flows to Hope, where it enters the lower reaches of the River Noe, which has flowed from Edale. The Noe then flows to Shatton near Bamford, before entering the River Derwent, which has travelled about ten miles from Bleaklow. The valley is now technically the Derwent Valley, but the term &quot;Hope Valley&quot; is still used as the Derwent flows through Hathersage and Grindleford. Other streams in the area include the Burbage Brook, which runs down from Burbage Valley through Padley Gorge and into the River Derwent near Grindleford station.

The area is a popular tourist destination, particularly as the Hope Valley Line railway from Sheffield to Manchester runs through it, from the western end of the Totley Tunnel near Grindleford to the eastern end of the Cowburn Tunnel near Edale.

In the centre of the valley is a long-established cement factory, the UK&#x27;s biggest, run by Hope Construction Materials. It is somewhat infamous locally because it is a prominent industrial operation in the middle of a National Park and is very visible from many locations. However, the factory provides valuable local employment outside the tourism sector.

The Hope Valley College is the only secondary school in the Hope Valley. Castleton Church of England Primary School (one of several primary schools in the valley) and the surrounding area was featured in Channel 4&#x27;s new (in October 2017) ident which shows images of the valley from Mam Tor.

==History==

There is evidence that Hope has been extremely significant in the region throughout its long history. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having both a priest and a church, the only place in north Derbyshire to have such status at the time. St. Peter&#x27;s Church, opposite the Old Hall public house, dates from around the 13th century.

The parish of Hope covered two thirds of the Royal Hunting Forest of north Derbyshire and was one of the largest parishes in the country. From earlier times there are traces of a Roman fort at Brough, just to the east of the village. Its Roman name Navio was later replaced with the Old English word for fort, Brough. Many ancient relics from the site can be seen in Buxton Museum. It is thought that the fort was probably built to protect Roman lead-mining interests in the Peak District.

The village is built on the A6187 Sheffield to Castleton road, near the junction of the B6049 that runs northward from Tideswell to Edale. This minor road closely follows the route of the old Portway, which was an ancient trading route used by Jaggers, a local term for men driving packhorses carrying salt and other goods from Cheshire. Names such as Saltergate Lane and Jaggers Lane probably originate from this period.

==Post town==
The Hope Valley post town lies in the postal area of Sheffield. It encompasses the S32 and S33 postal districts, and includes the following villages:

*Bamford
*Bradwell
*Brough
*Calver
*Castleton
*Edale
*Eyam
*Grindleford
*Hathersage
*Hope
*Stoney Middleton

<text>The Cherry Hill Arena was an indoor arena located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, built in 1959.
It was originally known as the Ice House and renamed the Delaware Valley Gardens before assuming its most familiar name. The arena, which seated 4,416, was the home of the short-lived Jersey Larks of the Eastern Hockey League in 1960-61 and hosted occasional home games of the NBA Philadelphia Warriors. In 1964 EHL hockey returned to the arena in the form of the Jersey Devils, who would be the arena&#x27;s longest-lasting tenants, surviving until the EHL folded in 1973. Early in the 1973–1974 hockey season, the New York Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association moved to the arena and played there as the Jersey Knights for the rest of the season. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; later described Cherry Hill Arena as &quot;perhaps the worst facility&quot; used by any WHA team, noting that it lacked showers in the dressing room for visiting teams, who had to dress at a Holiday Inn two miles away, and that the arena&#x27;s ice surface was not even level, giving the home team a distinct home advantage as the visitors would have to skate uphill to the opponent&#x27;s goal.

By 1978 the arena had been renamed The Centrum. The Jersey Aces of the Northeastern Hockey League began the 1978-79 season as tenants at the Centrum, but moved to Hampton, Virginia, after a handful of home games.

The Cherry Hill Arena was demolished in the 1980s and replaced by a shopping center, the main tenant of which was – at different times – a Kmart and three grocery stores, a Super G, Stop &amp; Shop, and lastly a Hung Vuong Food Market (Former ShopRite). Another shopping center, called the Centrum Shops, uses the arena&#x27;s final name but is located across Brace Road from the arena site. The Arena was owned by David Baird IV, CEO of Haddonfield Lumber.

<doc id="771196" wikidata="Q1949466" url="?curid=771196" title="Mossberg 500">
<text>The Mossberg 500 is a series of pump-action shotguns manufactured by O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons. The 500 series comprises widely varying models of hammerless repeaters, all of which share the same basic receiver and action, but differ in bore size, barrel length, choke options, magazine capacity, stock and forearm materials. Model numbers included in the 500 series are the 500, 505, 510, 535, and 590. The Revelation 310 and the New Haven 600 were also variations of the 500 series produced by Mossberg under different names. By 2021, about 11 million M500s had been produced, making it the most-produced shotgun of all time.

== History ==
Designed in 1961 by Carl Benson, the Mossberg 500 was created mainly for use by hunters, but quickly found itself in use by law enforcement because of its reliability and low cost. In the 1970s, the M500 was submitted for military use, but failed to meet the MIL-SPEC 3443E protocol, which involves firing 3,000 rounds of shells with no more than two malfunctions. During the testing, some M500s were created to better match the MIL-SPEC, which came at an increase in cost. M500s began to be purchased by the US military in limited numbers, with the first order consisting of approximately 5,900 shotguns for the Navy and Coast Guard.

To maintain its low cost, Mossberg continued to produce the M500 for civilian and police markets, and in 1987, designed the M590 specifically for military use. In response to a Navy request, the M590 was modified, with a thickened barrel, extended magazine, barrel shroud, and bayonet lug. The new model, designated the M590A1, became the standard shotgun in the United States military. 

Replacement for the M500 came as early as 1999, when the Marine Corps adopted the semi-automatic M1014 Combat Shotgun, which became standard issue by 2001. In 1997, the Army began to develop the M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System, an underbarrel shotgun designed for usage on the M4 carbine, which could also be used as a standalone weapon. The MASS first entered service in 2010. Despite the competing shotgun designs, including other pump action models such as the Remington Model 870 and Winchester Model 1200, Mossberg shotguns continued to see usage in various American military branches until the end of the 2010s.

M500 and M590 shotguns were first used during the 1991 Gulf War, wherein they were used to defend US supply depots. In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, M500 shotguns were primarily used for breaking locks and hinges during door breaches.
In 2009, U.S. Army Special Forces Groups procured Military Enhancement Kits to provide a standardized shotgun configuration based on the Mossberg 500. The kits included a collapsible stock, &quot;shotgun retention system&quot;, 1913 receiver rail, fore end rail system and breaching barrels. A total of 1301 shotguns were converted with the first unit being equipped in July 2009. The majority of the kits convert the standard issue shotgun to a 14&quot; compact model with a 16&quot; accessory breaching barrel, H92239-09-P-0113.

Mossberg later produced a compact pistol grip variant of M590, called &quot;Cruiser&quot;.

==Model 500 options==
The name &quot;Model 500&quot; covers an entire family of pump shotguns designed to chamber &quot;magnum&quot; shells. The standard model holds five or five shells in the magazine and one in the chamber. The Model 500 is available in 12 gauge, 20 gauge, and .410 bore, with the 12 gauge being the most popular and having the most optional features available. A 16 gauge model was introduced in 1963 and later discontinued.

===Finishes===
The standard finish for the Model 500 is an anodized aluminum alloy receiver and a polished and blued barrel. Some models come with a matte black matte-anodized receiver, and a matte blued barrel. Some 500 models are anodized to look parkerized, with parkerized barrels. This is also true of the 590 series since an aluminum receiver cannot be parkerized.

Mossberg also offers camouflage painted models, in a number of different patterns. Stocks are either wood or composite, with the composite stocks being matte black or camouflage to match the rest of the gun. A special model called the Mariner is available with the Marinecote finish, an electroless-nickel finish that is highly corrosion resistant. Mariner models use the black composite stocks.

===Model 500 vs. Model 590 vs. Model 590A1===
The primary difference between the Model 500 and Model 590 is in magazine tube design. The Model 500 magazines are closed at the muzzle end, and the barrel is held in place by bolting into a threaded hole at the end of the magazine tube. Model 590 magazines are designed to be opened at the muzzle end, and the barrels fit around the magazine tube and are held on by a capnut at the end. The Model 500 magazine facilitates easy barrel changes, as the barrel bolt serves no function other than holding the barrel in place. The Model 590 magazine facilitates easy cleaning and parts replacement, as removing the nut allows removal of the magazine spring and follower.

Both the Model 500 and Model 590 have polymer trigger guards and safeties, and standard barrels. The Model 590A1 has an aluminum trigger guard and safety, a heavier barrel, and a bayonet lug (although some versions of the 590 also have bayonet lugs), intended for military use under extreme conditions and rough handling; the metal trigger guard was added in response to the 3443G materials requirements, and the heavy barrel was added at the request of the Navy to prevent barrel deformation if the shotgun caught in the closing of heavy steel ship doors. Some 590A1s have a sling swivel on the back of the bayonet lug, some do not. The 590A1 usually has a swivel mount on the stock even when there is no corresponding mount on the forward end of the weapon. The 590A1 is generally sold through military and law enforcement channels, though in most jurisdictions the and barreled models are available and may be legally purchased by any non-prohibited persons. 590A1s with 14&quot; barrels are Title II firearms, and may be purchased only by non-prohibited persons in NFA-legal states, after completing BATF transfer forms.
The riot gun versions of the pistol grip Model 500 (Persuader, Cruiser, Road Blocker, and Mariner) are available with an and barrel depending on magazine capacity. The 590 is only available with a barrel and flush-fit magazine tube. The 590A1 is available with a , 18.5-inch, or barrel. One model sold as Model 590-SP (catalog item 51663) is technically a 590A1, as it uses the heavy barrel and military trigger group, but unlike models designated 590A1 it is sold on the civilian market.

Unlike Model 500 and 590 shotguns (with the exception of ghost-ring sight 590 models), Model 590A1 shotguns cannot be easily fitted with the common factory 500 heat shield, due to the heavier barrel. A heat shield and bayonet lug are required for military 3443G Type I riot shotguns, and some 590A1s are so equipped. The 590A1 heat shield, p/n 16335P, is available for purchase from Mossberg for about the same price as the 500 heat shield.

===Bantam and Super Bantam models===

The standard Model 500 uses a length of pull (LOP) for the stock, which is suitable for adult shooters of average or greater size. The Bantam models use a LOP stock and a forend that sits further back than the standard model. The Super Bantam stock includes two recoil pads and a stock spacer.

By using the short pad, the LOP can be reduced to ; with the spacer and longer pad, the LOP is . A number of different models are offered with Bantam and Super Bantam stocks, or they can be ordered as accessories and fitted to any Model 500.

===Model 505===
The new Model 505 Youth shotgun, introduced in 2005, is similar to the Bantam but scaled down further. The 505 has a LOP buttstock (compared to a standard model&#x27;s , or a Bantam&#x27;s ), a barrel, and a four-shot magazine tube. The 505 is available in 20 gauge and .410 bore. Parts are not interchangeable with other model 500 variants.

===Model 535===
The Model 535, new for 2005, is similar to the Model 500, but with a lengthened receiver that can fire shells, in addition to and shells. The 535 is a less expensive alternative to the Mossberg 835 Ulti-Mag, but the 535 lacks the 835&#x27;s overbored barrel. The non-overbored barrel of the 535 does, however, allow the use of slugs, which cannot be used in the overbored barrel of the 835.

Model 535 barrels are not interchangeable with Model 500 or Model 835 barrels, but 535 barrels are available in smoothbore and rifled in a variety of vent ribbed, barrel lengths and different sights. The 535 is also available in a tactical model with ghost ring sights and a collapsible pistol grip buttstock. Although Model 500 barrels can be used with Model 535 receivers, magazine tubes from the Model 500 must also be used because of the magazine tube length difference.

=== Model 590M ===
In 2018, Mossberg created the Model 590M, a magazine-fed variant of the M590 model utilizing detachable 5, 10 or 20 round magazines for civilian use. It currently is offered in both Shockwave and Standard models.

===Magazine capacity===
The Model 500 comes in a variety of different receiver configurations, whose main difference is the magazine configuration. The basic Model 500 comes with a magazine tube capable of holding five shells, which is called a six-shot model (a full magazine plus a round in the chamber). The 500 is also available with an extended magazine tube that holds seven rounds, making an eight-shot model. The 590A1 is available with five- and eight-shot magazines, sold as six- and nine-shot models respectively. The Model 590A1 also allows the use of magazine extensions in place of the magazine cap to further increase the capacity of ammunition.

The variants with the extended magazine tubes use different barrels, as the barrel is held in place by attaching at the end of the magazine tube. The shortest barrel length available for the eight- and nine-shot models is , which fits flush with the long magazine tube. A ribbed modified choke field barrel was also manufactured for the 8-shot model 500. The shortest barrel for Title I six-shot models is , while military and law enforcement personnel (as well private persons in NFA states) can also get a barrel (the 590 Compact), which uses a special 5-shot magazine.

==Model 500 variants==

The Model 500 is available in many variants, for a wide variety of applications. The ease of changing barrels on the Model 500 means that a single shotgun may be equipped by the owner with a number of barrels, each for a different purpose. As sold, the Model 500 is generally classed into two broad categories: field models and special purpose models.

===Field models===
Field models are the basic sporting models. They are available with a variety of barrel lengths and finishes, and may be set up for waterfowl hunting, upland game hunting, turkey hunting, or shooting slugs. Most smoothbore models come with interchangeable choke tubes and vent rib barrels, while the slug models come with rifle sights or scope bases, and may have smooth cylinder bore or rifled barrels.

===Special purpose models===

Special purpose models are intended for self defense, police, or military use. The Model 590 and the eight-shot Model 500s are only sold as special purpose models. Special purpose models have short barrels, either for the six-shot models, or for the eight- and nine-shot models, but the barrels are fully interchangeable with all models of the same magazine tube length and in the 500 family. Most models come with special designations like SPX, Tactical, Mariner, etc.

Special purpose models may be equipped with a variety of specialty parts which may include adjustable stock, &quot;Speedfeed&quot; stock that holds four additional rounds of ammunition, pistol grip, ghost ring and fiber optic sights, Picatinny rail, forearm band, heatshield, ported barrel, muzzle brake, and even a bayonet lug. All special purpose models come only in black trim with either blued, non-glare matte blue, or parkerized finishes and now come with drilled and tapped receivers for scope and optics mounting.

&quot;Special Purpose&quot; models are not the same as &quot;Law Enforcement&quot; models; the latter have heavier duty barrels, safeties, trigger guards, and will stand up to harder use.

In 2018, Mossberg released the 590M, a pump-action shotgun fed by a double-stack magazine. It is available in three models; one is a derivative of the Shockwave, the other two are variants of the base 590, one having ghost ring sights and a heat shield, the other without. The magazines are available in 5, 10, 15, and 20-round capacities.

===Law enforcement models===

Mossberg shotguns currently designated &quot;law enforcement models&quot; are 590A1s. 590A1s differ from other 500/590 shotguns, in that they have heavy barrels, metal trigger guards, and metal safeties. 590A1s are available in , , and barrels. The 590A1 is also used by the U.S. and allied armed forces, having been designed to meet the stricter standards outlined by the U.S. Army.

Model 500s were also previously sold as law enforcement combos in 12 gauge with both and barrels, birch buttstock, pistol grip and sling.

===Home security model===
The model 500 HS410, or &quot;Home Security&quot; model, is available in .410 gauge only, and is specifically designed for defensive use. It comes with a youth-sized stock, a vertical foregrip, and a special muzzle brake and spreader choke (to help produce wider patterns when using buckshot) on an bead sight barrel. The .410 gauge round, while by far the least powerful common shotgun chambering, remains a formidable shotgun shell. A 90-grain slug generates energy close to (and in some manufacturer claims, exceeding) a .357 Magnum when fired from a full length barrel. The HS410 is targeted at the novice user who desires a simple, easy to use, and effective defensive weapon. It is packaged with an introductory video covering use and safety, and some versions have a laser sight mounted in the foregrip.

==Mossberg Shockwave==
The Mossberg Shockwave is a pump action firearm based on the 590 series of shotguns. It is distinguished from the rest of the 590 series by its barrel and &quot;birds-head&quot; style grip. The Mossberg Shockwave was the best-selling pump action shotgun in the United States in 2020.

===Design===
The action of the Shockwave is taken from Mossberg&#x27;s 590 series of shotguns. It features the same sliding tang safety on the top rear of the receiver, twin action bars, and dual extractors seen on other models. The name is inherited from the manufacturer of the grip, Shockwave Technologies. Mossberg claims the grip reduces recoil. The Shockwave weighs empty, holds five rounds in the magazine tube, and has a single brass bead front sight with no rear sight. Production began in 2017 with a 12 gauge model, adding 20 gauge and .410 bore models later.

===Legality===
In the United States, the Shockwave does not fit the definition of a shotgun as defined by the ATF, which says that shotguns have barrels over in length and are made to be fired from the shoulder. It avoids restriction as a short barrel shotgun under Title II of federal firearm laws by remaining over in length and not being made to have a shoulder stock. The ATF refers to the Shockwave as a non-NFA firearm. While legal without a tax stamp at a federal level, regulations also vary by state, thereby prohibiting purchase in some states.

In Canada, the Shockwave is generally classified as a non-restricted firearm, as pump-action and other manually operated firearms with a fixed stock do not have a minimum factory barrel length requirement. The bird&#x27;s head grip meant the Shockwave is deemed as a regular long gun similar to a Mare&#x27;s Leg, and not a &quot;handgun&quot;.

==Accessories and combinations==
The Mossberg 500 has always been marketed as a multi-purpose firearm. Mossberg sells a wide variety of accessory stocks and barrels, allowing many configurations to be made (including, in the past, a bullpup configured model 500). Mossberg is also the only company to ever offer a double-action-only model. The model 590DA offers a longer, heavier trigger pull, to reduce the chance of an accidental discharge by the operator, and was targeted at the police market.

With the appropriate parts, the same Model 500 can be a field gun, a slug gun, defensive weapon for civilian, police, or military use, trap and skeet gun, or .50 caliber (12.7mm) rifled muzzleloader.

Mossberg has also sold &quot;combination&quot; sets, with a single receiver and more than one barrel. Common examples included a field barrel packaged with an cylinder bore barrel for defensive use, or a field barrel and a slug barrel, or a slug barrel and a .50 caliber muzzleloading rifle barrel.

A unique item offered by Mossberg for the Model 500 is a line launcher kit. It uses special blank cartridge to propel a shaft with an optional floating head and a light rope attached to it; a canister hung below the barrel to hold the line spool. A test of the Mossberg 500 with line launcher by the BoatUS Foundation showed an average range of over with the floating head. Distances of are claimed for the non-floating long distance head.

All Mossberg models including the 835, 535, 500, 505 and 590 (except for Special-Purpose and Law Enforcement models) are shipped with a wooden dowel with two rubber O-rings, also called a duck plug, located in the tube magazine. This is to comply with U.S. migratory bird laws. This dowel reduces and regulates the number of shells that can be loaded in the magazine to 2. This can be removed by taking off the barrel, pointing the shotgun downward, and shaking it back and forth lightly until the dowel shows out of the end of the magazine tube. It must then be pulled out, as the O-rings prevent it from just falling out. Except for the Maverick 88, all current production Mossberg models have a pre-drilled receiver for installation of an upper Picatinny rail for mounting various optics such as red dot sights. Some models can be bought with the rail and accessories already installed.

Some Mossberg models, like the 590, have a bayonet lug.

==Maverick Arms subsidiary==
Mossberg also markets a less expensive shotgun under the Maverick Arms name, the Mossberg Maverick 88, in blued finish, with synthetic stocks, and in appearance, it is virtually identical to the 500 model. Maverick and Mossberg shotguns share many interchangeable parts, but Maverick shotguns differ in some ways, such as lacking sling swivel studs and having cross-bolt safeties instead of tang safeties, which makes the trigger group non-interchangeable with the Model 500 shotgun. The one-piece forearm can be replaced with OEM or aftermarket parts with the addition of an action slide tube, as the factory forearm has the action bars pinned into place. The Maverick series also does not come drilled and tapped for rail mounts like the 500 models. There are two basic models of the 88, the 88 field and the 88 security, with a cartridge capacity of six or eight shots, and their magazines unscrew from the receiver and can be replaced with any of the tubular Mossberg 500/590 magazines.

==Model numbers==
*500A = 12 gauge
*500AB = 12 gauge, Dual Action Bar
*500B = 16 gauge (has been discontinued)
*500C = 20 gauge and 12 gauge
*500D = 28 gauge (never went into production)
*500E = .410 bore

==Users==
Mossberg produced two U.S. military versions of the model 500, the 500 MILS and the 500M MILS, the difference being the location of the upper sling swivel. The model numbers contain a U.S. prefix to the serial number. These particular models (500 MILS &amp; 500M MILS) contain all metal parts, are parkerized with a 20-inch barrel. The magazine capacity is 6+1.

<text>1201 Third Avenue (formerly Washington Mutual Tower) is a , 55-story skyscraper in Downtown Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. It is the third-tallest building in the city, the eighth-tallest on the West Coast of the United States, and the 97th-tallest in the United States. Developed by Wright Runstad &amp; Company, construction began in 1986 and finished in 1988. 1201 Third Avenue was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and The McKinley Architects. The building was the world headquarters of the financial company Washington Mutual from the building&#x27;s opening until 2006, when the company moved across the street to the WaMu Center (renamed the Russell Investments Center after the bank collapsed in 2008).

==History==
Kohn Pedersen Fox was hired to design the tower while visiting Seattle to be interviewed as a possible candidate for the job of designing the Seattle Art Museum. It was the first major office building built under Seattle&#x27;s 1985 downtown zoning plan, largely implemented in response to the Columbia Center, which called for height limits, interesting profiles, and height and density bonuses for public amenities to create a 24-hour downtown. The tower took advantage of all the height bonuses for public amenities that the 1985 plan called for including an entrance to the Metro Bus Tunnel (later renamed the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel), retail space, day care, public plaza, sculptured top, hillside public escalators, and lobby/atrium public access, as well as donating $2.5 million for off-site housing. By providing the amenities the designers were able to add 28 stories to the tower and almost double the base floor area ratio of the site. The building was built on the site of the 12-story Savoy Hotel which was imploded in 1986; however, the architects were able to incorporate two aluminum castings from the Savoy into the design of the tower. Another building on the same block, the historic Brooklyn (Hotel) Building was retained and this too was factored into the design of the tower.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; named it one of the three best new office buildings in the United States in 1988, and in the May 1989 issue of &quot;&quot; Walter McQuade called it &quot;perhaps the best recent addition to any U.S. skyline&quot;. Paul Goldberger said of the tower, &quot;The building seems proud of its height; for all its classical elements it has a certain sleekness, and in this sense it is characteristic of our time, at least in intention, for it bespeaks a desire to combine the formal imagery of classicism and the energizing aura of modernity.&quot; Seattlites have voted the 55-story skyscraper as one of their favorite buildings. The building is managed by Wright Runstad &amp; Company.

MetLife Real Estate Investments and Clarion Partners bought the building in 2012 for $548.8 million.

The building is home to a perch for Peregrine falcons, who are monitored using a public webcam that was installed in 1994.

In 2021, JPMorgan Chase (who acquired the remaining assets of Washington Mutual) moved into a space at 1201 Third Avenue. The single-floor space is used by 160 employees in the bank&#x27;s cybersecurity and technology division and was completed in 2022. The Puget Sound Regional Council, a metropolitan planning organization, moved its headquarters to the fifth floor of 1201 Third Avenue in January 2024. Perkins Coie, an original tenant, plans to move to the nearby Russell Investments Center in 2025 and vacate their space at 1201 Third Avenue.

<text>Clarke Stadium is a multipurpose stadium located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The stadium was originally built for Canadian football. Over the years different sports have participated at the site.

==History==
The stadium was originally built in 1938 and named for then-Mayor Joseph Clarke. It was built on land deeded to the city for the purpose of constructing public sports fields by the federal government (Prime Minister Mackenzie King was a personal friend of Clarke). The original Clarke Stadium accommodated approximately 20,000 fans in the spartan conditions consistent with its era. The seating area consisted of two grandstands on opposing sidelines. Some end-zone stands were added years later. The stadium hosted the Edmonton Eskimos (now Elks) of the Western Interprovincial Football Union/Canadian Football League from 1949 to 1978, following which the team moved to Commonwealth Stadium, which had been built adjacent to Clarke Stadium in preparation for the 1978 Commonwealth Games. Clarke Stadium was used for local and minor league sporting events after the departure of the football team.

==Remodelling==
The facility was almost completely demolished on June 1, 2000, and rebuilt as a &#x27;secondary&#x27; stadium for events of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics hosted in Edmonton. It was redesigned with approximately 1,200 seats in a single grandstand. The original grass playing surface was also replaced with artificial turf to allow for greater usage as part of the facility upgrade. The stadium is currently used for university, minor and intramural sports. Clarke Park, as the remodelled stadium is often known, is also used for concerts and other events. Including the playing surface, the capacity of the stadium grounds can exceed 6,000 for concerts and non-sporting events.

==Soccer==
The Edmonton Drillers of the 1970s and the Edmonton Aviators of 2004 both attempted to draw crowds to the much larger Commonwealth Stadium before moving to Clarke Stadium when they were unable to fill Commonwealth or turn a profit. In both cases, the move to Clarke Stadium was followed closely by the team folding.

The Edmonton Brick Men of the 1980s and 90s also played at the stadium but played most matches at John Ducey Park, which was primarily a baseball diamond.

FC Edmonton began playing their North American Soccer League home games at Clarke Stadium with the 2012 season. In May 2013, construction was completed to expand the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 5,000, using temporary seating. In August 2013, NASL Commissioner Bill Peterson and representatives of FC Edmonton met with officials of the City of Edmonton to discuss the installation of artificial turf, as the final step in converting the facility into a more soccer-specific stadium, while still allowing for other use. The conversion of the turf was completed in time for the 2014 season. The stadium was further renovated in advance of the 2019 CPL season, with seating increased to 5,148 and the block of temporary stands from 2013 removed in favor of permanent seating, with stands now added behind both goals along with pitch side tables beside both teams dugouts.

<doc id="771203" wikidata="Q2601249" url="?curid=771203" title="Debra Lafave">
<text>Debra Jean Williams (&quot;née&quot; Beasley; born August 28, 1980), better known under her former married name of Debra Lafave, is a former teacher at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida. In 2005, she pleaded guilty to lewd or lascivious battery against a teenager. The charges stemmed from a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old student in summer of 2004 when she was 23. Lafave&#x27;s plea bargain included no prison time, opting for three years of house arrest due to safety concerns, seven years of probation, and lifetime registration as a sex offender.

==Early life and education==

Lafave attended East Bay High School until 1996. From 1995 to 1996, Lafave dated Nick Carter. She also had a lesbian relationship with a classmate by the name of Casie Diana Martinez, and it was because of that relationship Lafave&#x27;s parents withdrew her from East Bay. She graduated from Bloomingdale High School in 1998. Around that time, she took a gig as a Pin-up model for the magazine &quot;Makes &amp; Models (M&amp;M)&quot;, which when the story of the sex scandal broke, her modelling photos from that time would contribute to sensationalising of the story. She attended the University of South Florida, graduating with a degree in English. After college graduation in 2002, she was hired as an English teacher at Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida. In July 19 2003, following her first year of teaching, she married Owen Lafave.

==Crime, first arrest and trial==
Lafave, then 23, committed statutory rape on a 14 year old student engaging in intercourse as well as oral sex with the student on four different occasions: once in the bedroom of her Riverview town house, once in her classroom portable, and multiple times in her car.

In April 2004, Lafave first met the student while she was helping out a friend, the football coach, at the school’s tag football game. Lafave had already garnered a reputation among the male students as being the young attractive “hot” teacher, and the student; being one of the players on the team and not being Lafave’s student, already knew of Lafave beforehand. It was there that the student first approached Lafave along with his friend and it was that moment that Lafave &amp; the student became officially acquainted. 

In May 2004, during the final week of school during grad night where the graduating class which the student was a part of took a trip to SeaWorld Orlando which Lafave chaperoned which the student &amp; Lafave got a chance to get to know each other &amp; develop a close relationship with one another despite the presence of Lafave’s then husband on that trip at the time; Owen Lafave. After that, Lafave during that week would go out of the way to put the student on detention to spend time with her in the detention room, even sometimes inviting his friends. Other times she would ask the student to stay afterschool to be with her. It was around that time when the two allegedly first kissed when on one of the occasions Lafave asked the student (along with his friends) to clean her portable classroom, the student asked Lafave to flash her breast at him. Allegedly Lafave only pulled up her shirt to reveal a tiny bit of the bottom of her bra, but when the students friends left leaving only Lafave and the student, according to the student, the two allegedly kissed. On the last day of school, one of the other students hosted a party inviting the student that Lafave had a love interest with and Lafave came with the student being the only teacher at that party. When curiosity arose about Ms. Lafave&#x27;s presence, the student referred to her as his &quot;girlfriend&quot;. By the end of the party, after driving all the other students home Lafave gave the student her number and allegedly was already talking about plans to have sex with the student. During the start of the summer holidays leading up to the first sexual encounter, Lafave and the student would talk on the phone often and Lafave would regularly drive the student to his summer activities; Recreation center, haircut, etc. and would regularly kiss on those car rides. It was around that time that Lafave opened up to the student that she was thinking about the student a lot and had feelings for him and could not get rid of those feelings.

Lafave’s sexual relationship with the student was exposed when the two went to visit the student’s cousin in Ocala; the very trip of what would end up being their final sexual encounter. His aunt (the accompanying cousin’s mother) who was living in Ocala at the time happened to have spotted the student &amp; Lafave in a parking lot and was alarmed at seeing him in the company of a provocatively dressed woman. Upon calling &amp; asking her son (the student’s accompanying cousin) to enquire about the situation, the cousin told his mother that the older woman was the sister of a mutual friend of theirs from the University of Florida and that they were buying Father’s Day presents together. Unconvinced, the aunt then alerted the student’s mother. Under intense questioning from his mother, the boy admitted that the woman was Lafave. Officers in Temple Terrace recorded conversations between Lafave and the boy, then arrested her at their next meeting. Two separate sets of charges were filed, because the alleged incidents occurred in both Riverview, in Hillsborough County, and Ocala, in Marion County. A trial date was set after the prosecution and defense could not agree on a plea bargain that involved prison time. Lafave faced a sentence of 5 to 15 years for each of the two counts of which she was accused.

Shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin, Lafave pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years of community control (house arrest) and seven years of sex offender probation. Prosecutors defended the deal, saying that sex offender probation in Florida is quite difficult to complete; Lafave could have gone to jail if she violated any of the probation terms.

Lafave&#x27;s guilty plea effectively ended her teaching career. As part of her plea deal, she was required to surrender her teaching license and was banned from ever teaching in Florida again. Under the terms of her probation, she had to be home by 10 p.m. every day, could not leave Hillsborough County without a judge&#x27;s permission, and could not be around minors. She also had to register as a sex offender. There was widespread skepticism as to whether a man guilty of lewd or lascivious battery would have received equally mild punishment.

On December 8, 2005, Marion County Circuit Judge Hale Stancil rejected the plea deal, claiming that any agreement that did not require Lafave to serve some prison time &quot;would undermine the credibility of this court, and the criminal justice system as a whole, and would erode public confidence in our schools.&quot; He set a trial date for April 10, 2006. The Marion County state&#x27;s attorney subsequently dropped the charges. In a statement, the prosecutors cited an assessment by psychologist Martin Lazoritz that found the victim would be so severely traumatized by a potential trial that it would take as long as eight years for him to recover.

Lafave&#x27;s lawyer John Fitzgibbons stated, &quot;To place Debbie into a Florida state women&#x27;s penitentiary, to place an attractive young woman in that kind of hellhole, is like putting a piece of raw meat in with the lions.&quot; Suzanne Goldenberg of &quot;The Guardian&quot; asserted that Lafave avoided jail time due to a faulty belief among Americans that she was &quot;too pretty for prison&quot;. Ariel Levy, writing in &quot;New York&quot;, called Fitzgibbons&#x27;s statement &quot;notorious&quot;, and Lafave&#x27;s ex-husband criticized it. Commentators have claimed that the attention given to this particular case arose from Lafave&#x27;s physical appearance. Provocative modeling photographs of Lafave have circulated on the Internet since she first gained notoriety.

The Temple Terrace Police Department came under scrutiny for taking graphic nude photos of Lafave while Lafave was in stirrups in a jail cell. John Gillespie, the lead detective who requested the nude photos of Lafave, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting.

==Second arrest and violation of probation==

Lafave was arrested on December 4, 2007, for violating her probation by speaking with a 17-year-old restaurant co-worker. The court ruled, however, that the violation was neither willful nor substantial, and it did not revoke her probation.

==Aftermath==
Lafave later attributed her criminal actions to bipolar disorder, which is associated with intense and irregular mood swings, and with hypersexuality and poor judgement during manic episodes. She was also treated for bipolar disorder after allegedly being raped at age 13 by a classmate. At the time of her arrest her sister had also recently been killed by a drunk driver.

In July 2008, within the terms of her plea deal, Lafave petitioned to convert the remainder of her house arrest to probation, having satisfied other terms such as sex offender therapy and community service. Her petition was granted and her house arrest ended four months early. On October 29, 2009, Lafave was cleared to have unsupervised contact with some children. On September 22, 2011, Lafave moved to end her probation four years early, based upon having completed all other obligations. Her petition was granted and her probation ended that day. The victim&#x27;s family stated that they would appeal the decision. The early termination of probation was reversed by the 2nd District Court of Appeals on August 15, 2012. 

Lafave asked the Florida Supreme Court to reinstate her release from probation. On January 24, 2013, Lafave was ordered to continue her probation while the Florida Supreme Court waited to hear the case. In October 2014, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Lafave.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;Tampa&quot;, by Alissa Nutting, was inspired by the case of Debra Lafave.

<text>The City of Rocks National Reserve, also known as the Silent City of Rocks, is a United States National Reserve and state park in south-central Idaho, approximately north of the border with Utah. It is widely known for its enormous granite rock formations and excellent rock climbing.

The rock spires in the City of Rocks and adjacent Castle Rocks State Park are largely composed of granitic rock of the Oligocene Almo pluton and Archean Green Creek Complex. City of Rocks is also a popular rock climbing area, with over 1,000 traditional and bolt-protected routes. In the 1980s, it was home to some of the most difficult routes in the country, mostly developed by Idaho climber Tony Yaniro. Climbers in the region refer to the area as simply &quot;The City&quot;.

During the 1840s and 1850s, wagon trains on the California Trail left the Raft River valley and traveled through the area and over Granite Pass into Nevada. Names or initials of emigrants written in axle grease are still visible on Register Rock, and ruts from wagon wheels can be seen in some of the rocks.

==History==

In 1849, an emigrant party with James Wilkins &quot;encamped at the city of the rocks&quot; on the California Trail just north of the Great Salt Lake Desert. Signatures in axle grease on rock faces can be seen today. One emigrant saw the distant rocks in August like &quot;water thrown up into the air from numerous artificial hydrants.&quot; Beginning in 1843, City of Rocks was a landmark for emigrants on the California Trail and Salt Lake Alternate Trail and later on freight routes and the Kelton, Utah to Boise, Idaho stage route.

The area&#x27;s historical and geological values, scenery, and opportunities for recreation led to its designation as City of Rocks National Reserve in 1988. This unit of the National Park System is managed cooperatively by the National Park Service and the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation.

===Native American history===
The Shoshone and Bannock tribes hunted the buffalo that once roamed in the City of Rocks area and gathered the nuts of the pinyon pine trees. The arrival of horses in the Americas in the 16th century and swelling European immigration disrupted the Shoshone-Bannock homelands and traditional way of life. They grew to resent the intruders but could do little to stop them. Most emigrants on the California Trail saw no Native Americans, but some of their journals record smoke rising from high hills and the surrounding mountains.

In 1826, Peter Skene Ogden and his Snake River brigade of beaver trappers were the first Euro-Americans to note the City of Rocks. Having few beaver, the area was ignored until 1843, when growing streams of wagons began flowing through the area in the summer.

===California Trail===

After many attempts to find a wagon route to California, early California settlers like Joseph B. Chiles and mountain men such as Joseph R. Walker found the route up the Raft River, through the City of Rocks, over Granite Pass and down a series of streams like Goose Creek and Thousand Springs to the Humboldt River. From the junction of the Humboldt near today&#x27;s Wells, Nevada they could follow the Humboldt west to the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) and on to California. Both Chiles, Walker and later John C. Fremont led settlers over this route. Later wagon parties seldom used guides but followed the tracks of the early pioneer&#x27;s wagons or the wagons in front of them. By 1850 so many people were on the trail that it was often like a long traveling village crawling its way to California. Newspapers and independent publishers in the east or mid-west often published emigrant &quot;guides&quot; that could be bought for little money from several different authors by 1850. The City of Rocks and the nearby Granite Pass (Idaho) marked roughly halfway to California for the emigrants and their loaded wagons. By 1846, some emigrants headed for Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley also used this route as part of the Applegate Trail. This rugged cutoff was little used in later years.

In 1848 Samuel J. Hensley, a pioneer that accompanied Joseph B. Chiles in 1842, pioneered the Salt Lake Cutoff from Salt Lake City north of the Great Salt Lake when he traveled east while returning to Missouri. The Salt Lake cutoff rejoined the main California Trail near the City of Rocks. Settlers using the Salt Lake Cutoff traveled about the same number of miles as settlers going by way of Fort Hall and west along the Snake River valley route. In 1852, some 52,000 people passed through the City of Rocks on their way to join the California Gold Rush.

When the California Trail was first opened in 1843, Granite Pass, near City of Rocks provided the pass that allowed an &quot;easy&quot; connection with streams and creeks that provided the needed water and grass for their teams along the way between the Raft River and the Humboldt River. After 1850 the Pass initially became part of Utah Territory, and in 1872 an Idaho-Utah boundary survey error establishing the Utah-Idaho boundary. placed Granite Pass in Idaho Territory. With the completion of the first transcontinental railroad on 9 May 1869, the overland wagon routes began to pass into history. However, wagons and stage lines saw continued use on regional supply routes that spread out from the railroad line to cities not on the railway line(s).

John Halley&#x27;s stage route connected the railroad (CPRR) station at Kelton, Utah, with Idaho&#x27;s mining hub of Boise, Idaho, and supplied the early economic development of Idaho, which won statehood in 1890. The Kelton stage route passed through the City of Rocks, with a stage station set up near the junction of the old California Trail and the Salt Lake Cutoff. Settlers began to homestead the City of Rocks area in the late 19th century. Dryland farming declined during the drought years of the 1920s and 1930s, but ranching survived. Livestock grazing began with early wagon use of the area in the mid-19th century and continues today.

One of the favorite camping spots for emigrants was Camp Rock. Emigrants wrote on the stone face with axle grease writing out their names and dates of passage.

==Facts and designations==

The Idaho Legislature declared Section 36 within City of Rocks as a state park under the jurisdiction of the Idaho Land Board on February 27, 1957. In 1964, a much larger area (more than ) was designated a National Historic Landmark. On March 15, 1973, Section 36 was transferred to the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation from the Department of Lands. The following year, the area was designated a National Natural Landmark. The National Park Service studied the site in the 1970s and 80s as a proposed national monument.

City of Rocks National Reserve was created November 18, 1988 by Public Law 100-696, Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act of 1988. This Act drew a boundary around owned or managed by the USDA Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation (IDPR), and private individuals. All lands owned by the United States within the Reserve boundaries were placed under the authority of the National Park Service (NPS). Between 1988 and 1996, the Reserve was co-managed by both NPS and IDPR. After the approval of a comprehensive management plan, the NPS officially transferred on-site management of the Reserve to IDPR on May 2, 1996. Today, the park functions under a unique cooperative agreement between the NPS and IDPR. Both agencies allocate partial funding to its operation. City of Rocks National Reserve is visited annually by over 80,000 visitors. The Reserve headquarters is located in the gateway community of Almo.

==Environment==
City of Rocks, an extraordinary encirclement of granite rising out of the gently rolling sagebrush country in south-central Idaho, has attracted and intrigued people since they first entered this region. The Shoshone camped here as did the emigrants traveling along the California Trail. One of the reserve&#x27;s most notable qualities is its large degree of biological diversity concentrated in a relatively small area. The great variety of textures, colors, and shapes in the natural landscape contributes considerably to the reserve&#x27;s scenic quality.

===Geologic formations===
The landscape of City of Rocks has been sculpted from granite that was intruded into the crust during two widely spaced times. The granite that composes most of the spires is part of the 28-million-year-old Almo pluton. However, some of the spires are made of granite that is part of the 2.5 billion-year-old Green Creek Complex that contains some of the oldest rocks in the western United States. The granite has eroded into a fascinating assortment of shapes.

City of Rocks was designated a National Reserve, a unit of the National Park Service, in recognition of the nationally significant geological and scenic values of its rock formations and the historical significance of the California Trail. Rock formations in the reserve developed through an erosion process called exfoliation, during which thin rock plates and scales sloughed off along joints in the rocks. The joints, or fractures, resulted from the contraction of the granite as it cooled, from an upward expansion of the granite as overlying materials were eroded away, and from regional tectonic stresses. The granite has eroded into a fascinating assortment of shapes as high as . The upper surfaces of many of the rocks are covered with flat-floored weathering pits known as panholes. The most notable panhole is located on top of Bath Rock and is continuously filled with water from rain or snowmelt.

===Animals===
Located in the Northern Basin and Range/Snake-Columbia shrub steppe ecoregions and the Raft Watershed of the Upper Snake River Basin, the habitat of the reserve supports a large variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, and invertebrates.

* Amphibians - Common amphibians that could be found near water include boreal toad, Great Basin spadefoot toad, and northern leopard frog.
* Birds - The reserve provides excellent breeding and prey habitat for many raptor species including golden eagle, prairie falcon, red-tailed hawk, northern harrier, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, American kestrel, turkey vulture, and great horned owl. Swainson&#x27;s hawk and ferruginous hawk are less abundant in the reserve. Other common bird species includes sage grouse, pinon jay, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, common nighthawk, rock doves, mourning doves, cliff swallow, mountain bluebird, hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, rock wren, house wren, solitary vireos, warbling vireos, green-tailed towhee, Virginia&#x27;s warbler, Brewer&#x27;s blackbird, and various sparrows.
* Mammals - A partial list of mammals in the reserve includes, cougar, mule deer, coyote, bobcat, badger, yellow-bellied marmot, cliff chipmunk, mountain cottontail rabbit, black-tailed jackrabbit, snowshoe hare, northern grasshopper mouse, Merriam&#x27;s shrew, several species of voles, and a variety of bats. Pronghorn and bison were probably common a century ago.
* Reptiles - Typical lizard species include the western whiptail, western fence lizard, Long-nosed leopard lizard, sagebrush lizard, and northern desert horned lizard. Snakes include the western rattlesnake, Great Basin gopher snake, striped whipsnake, and wandering garter snake. The western rattlesnake is the only strongly venomed snake found in the reserve.

===Plants===

Notable plant life includes:
* The Kruckeberg&#x27;s sword fern is found in the cool, moist micro-habitats in the granite formations. The fern grows in rock crevices and is normally found at higher elevations than City of Rocks. Primary threats to this species are trampling and or removal by visitors along rock climbing routes.
* Stands of piñon/juniper woodlands are dominated by the single-leaf piñon pine and Utah juniper, interspersed with mountain big sagebrush and curl-leaf mountain mahogany. The pinon seed is edible and gathered by local residents. Higher slopes are covered with mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, serviceberry, and bitterbrush, with other shrubs, grasses, and herbs growing in the openings between shrubs. Groves of aspen, stands of douglas-fir and lodgepole pine, are located on the upper stony/grassy slopes of the reserve. Quaking aspen groves occur in canyons containing streams.

Other dominant plants in the City of Rocks National Reserve include:
* Piñon / juniper woodlands and forest
* Conifer / aspen woodlands and forests
* Riparian scrub and herbaceous wetlands
* Big sagebrush and grasslands
* Mixed scrub
* Mountain mahogany scrubs
* High elevation meadows
* Other unvegetated areas

===Weather===
The semi-arid climate is characterized by low to moderate precipitation, great extremes in both daily and seasonal temperatures, and low relative humidity. Average annual precipitation is approximately at the lower elevations and in the highest areas. Average snow depths for higher elevations range between 35 and . Summers are hot and dry with occasional thunderstorms.

===Mountains===
The reserve is in the southern part of the Albion Mountains, bordered on the east by the Raft River valley and to the north by the Snake River valley. Elevations rise from where Circle Creek meets the reserve boundary to at the top of Graham Peak to the north.

===Soils===
The majority of the soils in the reserve are composed of grus, a coarse angular sand derived from the disintegration of the underlying granitic bedrock. They are highly erodible. Soil erosion is greatest near roads and on steep slopes and intermittent stream channels. Erosion in these areas has formed deep gullies. Some of the exposed soil banks are over high.

== Controversy ==
Climbing on the &quot;Twin Sisters&quot;, a major geological formation in the Reserve, was banned following a National Park Service decision and later court case involving the Access Fund. The Access Fund asserted that the NPS decision was &quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; while the NPS claimed that rock climbing on the Twin Sisters disrupted the &quot;historic viewshed&quot; of the California Trail.

<text>A drill team can be one of four different entities:

# A military drill team is a marching unit that performs routines based on military foot or exhibition drills. Military drill teams perform either armed or unarmed.
# A [[dance squad|dance drill team]] creates routines based on precision dance movements rather than military drill. These teams usually do not carry anything, but may use props in field production numbers. They may perform to recorded music, or the live music of an accompanying marching band.
# A team that execute routines carrying either one or multiple flags or pom-poms. This team&#x27;s movements are also based in dance and may also have a heavy influence of gymnastics as well. These teams also may perform to music, either live or recorded.
# A team that is mounted (horse, motorcycle, etc.) or advances some type of mobile object (library carts, lawn chairs, or even garbage bins). May also include teams of dogs and handlers.

==Military/police drill team==
A military drill team is a marching unit that performs routines based on military drill. These teams often perfect their proficiency and then choose to compete against other programs. These competitions are generally called &quot;drill meets&quot;, and are held all across the world.

=== Canada ===
The Canadians have the Canadian Cadet Organization, which consists of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Royal Canadian Army Cadets, and the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, all of which have drill competitions throughout the year which are hosted by the Regional Cadet Support Units.

Canadian drill competitions consist of the following aspects:

* Fall in
* Drill Team dress and deportment
* Drill Team Commander&#x27;s dress and deportment
* Compulsory drill procedures at the halt
* Compulsory drill procedures on the march
* Drill performance in a precision routine (optional)

Drill units in the Canadian Army include the Ceremonial Guard and the 2nd Battalion, Royal 22e Régiment in the Primary Reserve and the Regular Force respectively. The Royal Military College of Canada also maintains a 24-member drill team. The RCMP Musical Ride is the only mounted drill team of its kind in the world.

=== Greece ===
The Hellenic Navy has a precision movement unit called &quot;Άγημα Κινήσεων Ακριβείας&quot; (Agima Kiniseon Akriveias). It is made up of conscripts and also takes part in the &quot;Μεικτός Λόχος Απόδοσης Τιμών&quot; (Meiktos Lohos Apodosis Timon/Mixed Guard of Honour), a tri-service guard of honour composed of servicemen from the Hellenic Army, the Hellenic Navy, and the Hellenic Air Force is maintained as part of the Ministry of National Defence.

=== India ===

In the Indian Armed Forces, there is currently one unit that is serves as exhibition drill team. This unit, known officially as the Air Warrior Drill Team (AWDT), was founded in 2004 as part of the Indian Air Force. They commonly perform during the Air Force Day Parade at Tezpur Airport on 8 October.

=== Malta ===
The Armed Forces of Malta Drill Team and the Malta Police Precision Drill Team serve as the only military drill units in the Republic of Malta. The platoon-sized AFM Drill Team has performed synchronized drill since its revival in August 2014, and is based on the British and Canadian procedures for military drill and exhibition drill. The Malta Police Precision Drill Team, on the other hand, has been performing drill for more than 25 years prior to the establishment of the AFM team. Unlike the AFM team, who carry the FN FAL on parade, the police team carries a Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk VI. The platoon consists of 21 policemen, who are selected from the various sections of the Malta Police. Their main appearances include the Malta Military Tattoo and the Republic Day on St. George&#x27;s Square.

=== Norway ===

The Norwegian military consist of only one single company sized drill team, consisting of a band and a drill platoon. The team is one of five infantry companies that are assigned the mission to protect His Majesty the King of Norway and the royal family, as well as guarding the Royal Palace. The 3rd company, HMKG are also used to represent the Norwegian armed forces at state-related matters such as state-visits, ceremonies, national festivities, and were also prominent in the Winter World Cup 2010 as guards. As of 2012, His Majesty the King&#x27;s Guard is also responsible for the safety and defence of the city of Oslo, in case of a national crisis. A total of six companies make up His Majesty The King&#x27;s Guard (Hans Majestet Kongens Garde), and is a part of the Norwegian army.

The band is hand picked through interviews and playing tests prior to the draft date. The band consists of signal horns, a drumline, a pit and the main band. Most of the members year goes to practising and basic military training as the year is a part of their military service. The band is probably the only troop that almost never have &quot;green&quot; duty (as in field duty). Also, the band never stand guard at the castle nor the other guarding posts around Oslo, neither does the drill platoon.

The drill platoon consists of 32–40, first-year servicing soldiers. These are all hand picked through a rigorous selection process that lasts from their drafting at the start of October till December. The soldiers go through basic military training as well as having to learn how to march, weapons drill, and how to perform synchronically. Throughout the selection process, the soldiers have to prove themselves worthy a spot on the drill team, as these soldiers will be representing not only the King&#x27;s guard, but also the Norwegian military and the Norwegian state both national and internationally. Everything in their daily duty from the bed, room, facilities, closets, uniforms, and physique needs to be at excellent standards 24/7. These women and men strive for perfection in all that they do and are often seen running around the various woods nearby the base as well as working out at the gym. Every year, these soldiers finish their service with one of the highest average physical results in the army. Their uniforms are spotless and wrinkleless, in addition their boots are so well polished that you can literally reflect yourself in them. As opposed to what one might think, these soldiers draft year have been compared to as even harder than what the first-year service in the special forces is. Though most likely not as hard physically, the mentality and the pressure in being the best of the best puts these soldiers under a tremendous amount of pressure every hour of every day, every day of the year. Their rigorous training results in being one of the best drill teams in the world.

The band and drill platoon (3rd company) is the only drill team that have been invited to the legendary Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo nine times, 2012 being the most recent.

=== Russia ===
The Russian Armed Forces maintains many ceremonial drill units in its ranks, with the drill platoons in the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant&#x27;s Regiment and the Kremlin Regiment being the seniormost among them. Drill units in Russia set the precedent for units of that nature in and around the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), especially in countries such as Belarus, Armenia, and Turkmenistan.

=== Singapore ===
The Silent Precision Drill Squad of the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command (SAFMPC) is the sole drill unit of the Singapore Armed Forces that performs Exhibition drill. It is usually seen leading the contingent of new guards from the SAFMPC towards the Istana in the daily Guard mounting ceremony. It is also seen at the annual National Day Parade (NDP). The National Cadet Corps and National Police Cadet Corps also sport drill units, usually performing at school events competitions, or open houses. These units are known as Precision Drill Squads, a type of drill unit which executes rifle drill in complex series of movements with co-ordination and precision.

=== United States ===
All of the United States military service branches have an official drill team part of their respective service honor guard. The service academies have drill teams, as well as many college and university ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) and high school JROTC (Junior ROTC) units. Additionally, many community-based organizations such as the Army Cadet Corps, Naval Sea Cadets, Young Marines, and Civil Air Patrol maintain military drill teams. Formerly, some of these units were called Crack Squads.

====The drill meet====
A drill meet is a competition for military-style drill teams. The US military&#x27;s honor guard units have drill teams; however, they do not compete against each other in a drill meet such as this. The only exception to this is Pro America where individuals compete, but not the full drill teams. US high school JROTC and college ROTC teams often compete against each other.

The top American bladed (bayonet-only) independent drill meet was Pro America and the top American independent armed drill meet is the Isis World Drill Championships for post high school professional exhibition drillers in the nation. The same concept is also applied to various police departments and agencies. Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) programs may also compete in the National High School Drill Team Championships held in Daytona Beach, Florida. There are two divisions for competing, Unarmed, and Armed. During the summers, most drill teams go to drill camps to hone their skills. Also see high school &quot;military&quot; drill teams in high school. Washington, Idaho, California.

At the college level, teams may compete in the Mardi Gras Invitational Drill Meet hosted by Tulane University and the Cornell University Invitational Drill Meet (CUIDC).

=====Phases=====
Each meet has different phases:

Many drill meets differ regarding what events are offered and what divisions of competition are presented. Drill meets generally include both an armed and unarmed divisions. Events offered generally include several different phases: inspection, color guard regulation drill, and, in addition, (drill based on a service&#x27;s drill manual) an exhibition drill in which they march intricate maneuvers along with manipulating equipment including rifles, sometimes with fixed bayonets.

*Inspection (I) : Each team goes through a standard military inspection for an up-close critique of their bearing, knowledge and overall appearance.
*Regulation drill (RD) : A fixed list of verbal commands, armed or unarmed from a service&#x27;s drill and ceremonies manual (see also Military parade), given by a single cadet commander. This cadet commander must memorize these commands at most every meet and the team must perform these movements as per regulations.
*Exhibition drill (XD) : XD is based in RD, but is then infused with a Driller&#x27;s imagination. XD has different categories:
** Solo/one-man (A single driller)
** Tandem/two-man (2 drillers)
** Small team (4–8 drillers) (Note: this category replaces tetrad and squad)
** Platoon/flight (9–26 Drillers)
*Color guard regulation drill (CGR): The military color guard is not to be confused with a marching band&#x27;s color guard (see Color guard (flag spinning) for more information), although music-related color guards have their roots in the military version. This is similar to the drill team RD phase in that there is a fixed list of commands from a service&#x27;s drill and ceremonies manual that the cadet commander must memorize and execute with his/her color guard unit. Units are often required to &quot;case&quot; (commands required to cover the colors for transport/storage), and/or &quot;uncase&quot; (commands required to uncover the colors for competition/display) as a part of the competition.

=====Weapons=====
Each of the above phases can be marched by an armed (with a military sword, saber, or rifle) or unarmed team. NOTE: Many drill meets allow the use of a sword in the unarmed division, but never a rifle of any kind. All drill teams can march a guidon.
*Standard drill team rifles in the United States are the M1 Garand, M14, or the M1903 Springfield rifle. Armed teams usually use a demilitarized version of the rifle or a facsimile, which may be light-weight for spinning (such as for marching show band use).
*Unarmed teams concentrate on varied body and arm movements with intricate steps. Armed teams then add manipulation of the equipment, known as &quot;manual of arms&quot; in regulation drill events.

=====Judging=====
The current system used almost all military drill competitions includes multiple military judges each looking at the unit as a whole while they are competing at differing angles. These judges then grade every aspect of the performance on their own score sheets. This grading is based strictly on the military drill manuals in use for the meet (i.e., Army TC 3-21.5, Marine Corps Order P-5060.20, Air Force Manual 36-2203, etc.) Using this evaluating technique closely parallels what most of these individuals have done throughout their military careers at various levels throughout their training (most of these evaluators come from military training facilities and/or base honor guards). Judges score teams within ranges from POOR, to AVERAGE, to EXCEPTIONAL. Most meets using this system have a &quot;Judge&#x27;s Notes&quot; section where judges are either encouraged or required (depending on the meet) to write some candid notes for the team to utilize to interpret the numerical scores delivered on the score sheets.

==Dance and semi-military teams==

===United States===

====Texas====
Dance drill teams evolved from early pep squads and military-style drum and bugle corps that performed in the stands and/or during halftimes at football games.

Gussie Nell Davis, originally from Farmersville, Texas, laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the world famous Kilgore College Rangerettes located in Kilgore, Texas the world‘s first precision drill team when she created the &quot;Flaming Flashes&quot; pep squad at Greenville High School in 1929. Starting with simple marches, stunts, and letter formations, Davis led the Flashes to evolve into a dynamic squad, adding twirling batons, basic dance moves, and ultimately becoming a precision drum and bugle corps with help from a band director in Port Arthur, Texas. This foundational experience shaped her vision, and in 1940, Davis brought her expertise to Kilgore College, where she created the Rangerettes, the first-ever collegiate drill team. The Rangerettes set new standards in precision dance and halftime entertainment, becoming iconic in Texas and beyond, with their influence reaching far beyond high school and college drill teams.

Kay Teer Crawford, a high school cheerleader in the Rio Grande Valley during the early 1930s, had an idea of forming a team from the girls who were not selected for cheerleader. After graduating from college, Kay returned to Edinburg High School to teach physical education and to direct the Sergeanettes in 1936. They marched on the field with a &quot;military swing&quot; style, and eventually evolved into an acclaimed precision dance group. Crawford is equally noted with Gussie Nell Davis as having started the &quot;drill team&quot; concept, but it was Crawford who later started the national dance competition industry.

In 1939, the president of Kilgore College, Dean B.E. Masters, contacted Gussie Nell Davis about coming to Kilgore, Texas, to start a group that would &quot;be interesting and keep the folks in their seats at half-time.&quot; They also needed to recruit women to the school since the enrollment was primarily made up of men who were seeking to learn more about the oil business. Dr. Masters was not quite sure what he wanted, but he knew he did not want a traditional drum and bugle corps. He wanted something new, something that did not yet exist, and left the decisions up to Miss Davis.

Miss Davis created the &quot;Rangerettes&quot; to perform at Kilgore College football game halftimes. The Rangerettes almost immediately became the gold standard for all teams, both high school and college, and almost all Texas drill teams now consist of a line of performers with the officers in front of the team leading them in at every game.

In Tyler, Texas, just 30 miles from Kilgore, the second college drill team to be created in Texas was the Tyler Junior College Apache Belles in 1947. A fierce but friendly rivalry between the Apache Belles and the Rangerettes developed quickly, and continues to this day.

Much like Miss Davis, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, was recruited by Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University) in 1960 to create the &quot;Strutters&quot;, the first drill team at a four-year college.

There are over a thousand high school drill teams in the state of Texas today with over 30,000 students participating every year. The traditional uniform for these teams usually consists of a white hat with white boots. The officers of the teams also typically wear an all white uniform, while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines, usually in the style of kick, prop, military, or pom, at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies. Also in the Spring, teams put on a &quot;Spring Show,&quot; similar to a recital, to showcase all of the dances they competed at competitions to the school and community. The finale consists of a traditional kick routine in their school uniforms.

Traditionally, Texas high school drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.

====California====
The first dance-drill teams in California were school affiliated. Teams in California now typically identify as either a pep squad, drill team, dance team, dance-drill team, or dance company. But these affiliations began to widen greatly as parks &amp; recreation programs, independent performing arts programs, and dance studios opened across the state in the late 1980s and developed their own dance-related programs. More traditional drill teams march in parades with school marching bands during the fall/winter, perform field shows (halftime shows) at athletic events, and compete at indoor dance/drill competitions during the late-winter and/or spring seasons.

After moving from Texas to California following her collegiate studies, drill team founder Dr. Kay Teer Crawford eventually started the world&#x27;s first national precision dance-drill team competition in 1967: Miss Dance Drill Team USA (aka U.S. Nationals &amp; Pageant, MDDTUSA). In 1981, Crawford also created the world&#x27;s first international dance competition: Miss Dance Drill Team International. The U.S. National dance competition and world championships are now held annually in Southern California.

But there are now numerous drill team &amp; dance team competition circuits in California (i.e. Miss Dance Drill Team USA, Varsity/USA/UDA, CADTD, Sharp International, NRG etc.). And while most current school-affiliated teams do not compete on the festival level, those that do are consistently adjudicated in the following areas as developed by Dr. Kay Teer Crawford (Different competition circuits place different point/percentage weight on the importance of each of the following three areas in determining a final score):

*Routine choreography
*Technical execution
*Showmanship

There are also quite a variety of categories in which a team can compete. Examples are as follows:

*Jazz
*Lyrical
*Contemporary
*Military
*Kick
*Hip Hop
*Pom/songleader
*Character
*Novelty
*Prop
*Dance-drill
*Co-ed dance
*Show production

Unlike other states where schools are placed in separate divisions based on their school attendance size (as associated with state-organized athletic organizations), no such affiliation currently exists in California because dance is not considered an athletic sport. As a result, competition divisions are sub-divided into size of the performance group in a given routine, with teams allowed to compete in as many sizes as they wish:

*Small
*Medium
*Intermediate
*Large

All teams are adjudicated on a point system, with total points deciding ordinal rankings in determining winners.

====Washington====
In Washington state, the phrase &quot;drill team&quot; usually refers to high school performance/spirit teams that compete in the &quot;drill&quot; and/or &quot;military&quot; category at local, regional and statewide &quot;dance/drill&quot; competitions. Drill routines (sometimes referred to as &quot;drills&quot;) typically entail (indeed some argue &quot;should&quot; entail):

*highly regimented procedures for entering and exiting the stage;
*precise symmetry and/or spacing in the team&#x27;s formations (a.k.a. line straightness);
*precise transitions between formations that do not compromise line straightness;
*perfect or near-perfect synchronization and sharpness in the teams&#x27; marching and other bodily movements; and
*interesting music selection.
*(Many drill teams incorporate kicklines into their routines; many other successful drill routines have been accomplished without them.)

Judging is currently known as ordinal judging and ratings categorized by superior, exceptional, excellent, and good.

The WIAA Dance/Drill competition is the annual championship event for qualified dance and drill teams held annually in the last weekend of March.

A Washington drill team member, or &quot;driller&quot;, is not a dancer, but a dancer can be a driller. Since the foci of drill are presentation and spatial precision, drillers do not necessarily need attributes typically ascribed to dancers, such as a high level of flexibility (although this is a large portion of what many teams exhibit in their routines and part of their score) or an aptitude for expressing emotions with the body. This generally allows for larger team sizes, with most teams having about 20 or more members.

====Utah====
In Utah, most 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A schools have a drill team. This sport is incredibly competitive in this state, probably due to the high number of dancers. Tryouts are normally held the school year before the performing season during the months of April and May, giving teams the entire summer to work on their technique. During this time, drill teams often attend a dance camp to learn small dances to perform at school events such as sports games and assemblies. Along with these shorter routines, teams also learn longer and more technical competition routines to compete at a few invitational competitions and later a regional competition. The teams that place at the top at region (usually the top 4) go to state to compete against other teams in other regions.

Performed dance styles include military, kick, character, lyrical, hip hop, pom, jazz, and officer, among others.

Every year at region and state competitions, teams compete in military and dance, and every other year, compete in kick or character.

*Dance - Dance routines feature technique and performance above all. Teams are judged on their precision, flexibility, leaps, turns, kicks, and other skills such as projection, facials, vocals, and visuals. 
*Military - Military is a unique style and surprising at first. Military routines use intricate formations, walking patterns, arm sequences, kicks, and drop splits, and require the team to appear as one person, every move being incredibly precise and sharp. Facials are typically intense or neutral, and the music is usually instrumental. It is typically part of a marching ensemble, or marching band.
*Kick - A kick routine is all about legs. The majority of the routine is kicking, either in a line, partnership, or alone. Scores are based on the number of kicks in the routine, how together they are, how high they are, and how straight and pointed the legs and feet are.
*Character - Character is about becoming a certain person, thing, or idea and performing as such. Technique is still a priority like in other styles, but it must be done as the character. Teams are judged on how well they fit the persona, use any props, their technique, and their performance as a whole in the way of projection and facials.

<text>Good Singin&#x27; Good Playin&#x27; is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Grand Funk Railroad. The album was released on August 2, 1976, by MCA Records.

The band had actually broken up, but after Frank Zappa expressed interest in producing an album for them, they reassembled for one more attempt at success. Recorded in 1976 for MCA Records, this album included a guest performance by Zappa, playing lead guitar on the song &quot;Out to Get You&quot;. Although the pairing seemed bizarre, Grand Funk drummer Don Brewer said, &quot;His whole viewpoint on what rock and roll is all about is basically the same as ours... Keep it as simple as possible and really bring the balls out of this thing.&quot; Zappa said, &quot;All I did was, in a documentary way, make a record which tells you exactly what they really sound like. For the first time on record you can hear Grand Funk Railroad ... and they&#x27;re fantastic, fan-tastic with an F three times taller than you!&quot; Grand Funk decided on the first day of overdubs to split up again, although Zappa stayed until 4 a.m. trying to talk them out of it.

The album peaked at No. 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. The album was the final release to feature both bassist Mel Schacher and keyboardist Craig Frost.

In addition to training numerous neurosurgeons, his &quot;ingenuity in adapting advanced technologies&quot; saved many lives and even influenced the television program &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. Among other innovations, he created the first intensive care unit dedicated to neurosurgery, pioneered the use of medical imaging and catheterization in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, and helped define the fields of pediatric neurosurgery and neuroradiology.

== Early life and education ==

Ransohoff was born to a Jewish family in Cincinnati, Ohio, son of Dr. Joseph Louis Ransohoff II, a surgeon who himself was the son of a surgeon. He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University. While attending Harvard he briefly considered leaving the country in order to participate in the Spanish Civil War, motivated by his lifelong socialist sympathies. One of Ransohoff&#x27;s favorite boasts was that he was the only student in the history of Harvard to graduate on parole. He later received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1941 and went on to become a surgery instructor at the University of Cincinnati, like his father and grandfather before him. Three years into his residency, he was drafted into the United States Army where he was taught neurosurgery. During the war, Ransohoff was present at both the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. In the course of his service, he personally befriended General George S. Patton, and became a fixture in the General&#x27;s close circle of associates. Later in the war, Ransohoff was assigned to air evacuation centers in France and Germany.

== Career ==

After three years in the military, Ransohoff completed his residency at Montefiore Hospital. He went on to teach at Columbia University and practice surgery at the New York Neurologic Institute at Presbyterian Hospital. In 1962, Ransohoff was invited to become chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at the New York University School of Medicine, a prestigious position he held for over thirty years. While in this capacity, he was famed for hosting a weekly spinal and neurosurgical gathering for doctors of the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to come and seek his advice on challenging cases. Ransohoff was part of the team at George Washington University Hospital that successfully operated on White House Press Secretary James Brady after the Secretary was shot in the 1981 Reagan assassination attempt. During his chairmanship at NYU, he was also known as an early and strong advocate of wider stem cell treatments.

In 1992, Dr. Ransohoff left New York University Hospital for Tampa, Florida, at the behest of the James A. Haley VA Hospital, which wanted to reform its neurosurgical department. Professionally he greatly improved the neurosurgical and spinal centers at the VA Hospital and Tampa General Hospital, and significantly added to the brain cancer research programs at Moffitt Cancer Center.

==Personal life and death==
In 1940, he married Dr. Rita Meyer, a psychotherapist who wrote &quot;Venus After 40&quot;, a book about men&#x27;s responses to sexuality in older women; they divorced in December 1983. In April, 1984, he married Lori Cohen (born 1956), a dentist; they had a son born in 1989.

Ransohoff died at his home on the morning of January 30, 2001 of natural causes.

== Legacy ==

The book &quot;Brain Surgeon: An Intimate View of His World&quot; () by Lawrence Shainberg was based on his life. He also served as a consultant to the popular television series Ben Casey; some viewers familiar with Ransohoff feel that he and Casey have similar personalities. He was a cousin of director/producer Martin Ransohoff.

<text>Empire Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium that stood at the Pacific National Exhibition site at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Track and field and Canadian football, as well as soccer, rugby and musical events, were held at the stadium. The stadium was originally constructed for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. The stadium (which sat 32,375 upon opening, but 30,229 after 1974) hosted both Elvis Presley and The Beatles. It saw most of its use as the home of the BC Lions of the CFL from 1954 to 1982, in which the venue also played host to the first Grey Cup game held west of Ontario in 1955. Empire Stadium also hosted the Grey Cup game in 1958, 1960, 1963, 1966, 1971, and 1974; seven times in total.

Empire Stadium was often home to the Shrine Bowl Provincial Championship for provincial senior high school.

The stadium was also home to the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League during the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the Vancouver Royals of the same league for their only year of play in 1968.

Just before the 1966 Grey Cup game, the stadium had the new &quot;gooseneck&quot; or &quot;slingshot&quot; goal posts erected invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman, marking the first time these goalposts were used at any level of football in a championship game. They were first used a week earlier at Montreal&#x27;s Autostade for the 1966 Eastern Conference final; this model goalpost would soon become the standard design in the NFL and CFL. In 1970, it became the first facility in Canada to have artificial playing surface installed made by 3M, under the brand name &quot;Tartan Turf&quot;.

Both the Lions and Whitecaps moved to BC Place Stadium for the 1983 season. The stadium was demolished in the early 1990s. The site served as a parking lot for the neighbouring Pacific National Exhibition as well as Playland for many years before being converted to a soccer field and track on the site of the old field.

With BC Place Stadium undergoing renovations in 2010 and 2011, the BC Lions and Vancouver Whitecaps played their home games at Empire Field, a temporary field constructed on the former grounds of Empire Stadium. After the renovations to BC Place were complete, the temporary stadium was removed. The park and sports fields were restored for community use.

==The Miracle Mile==
Vancouver hosted the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954 at Empire Stadium. The most famous event of the games was the One Mile Race in which both John Landy and Roger Bannister ran the distance in under four minutes. The race&#x27;s end is memorialized in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race), that stood outside the stadium until its demolition. The statue formerly stood near the south end of Hastings St., but has since been moved to the Pacific National Exhibition north entrance just metres from where the feat took place at the new Empire Fields.

<doc id="771239" wikidata="Q4115810" url="?curid=771239" title="National Defense Academy of Japan">
<text>, abbreviated is the national, four-year university-level service academy aimed to educate and train students who will be serving as officers in the three services of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. It is located in Yokosuka, Kanagawa.

==History==
The National Defense Academy of Japan was opened in 1952 as , and was renamed &quot;National Defense Academy&quot; in 1954, when the incipient Japanese military was renamed from to the Japan Self-Defense Forces. In contrast to the pre-war period, when the Imperial Navy and Army had separate academies (respectively, the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy), the National Safety Academy (later the National Defense Academy) was established as a unified institution in order to mitigate the effects of sectionalism and inter-service rivalry. The Academy matriculated its first female student in 1992.

==Selection==
Its main course students are selected from applicants and typically are recent graduates from Japanese civilian senior high schools who have completed twelve years of formal schooling. They are paid a salary as employees of the Ministry of Defense.

After graduation they are posted to the Officer Candidate Schools in one of three forces, conduct training alongside civilian university graduates and internal promotees before being commissioned as an officer after a year or two.

==Postgraduate==
The academy also conducts master&#x27;s and doctoral level courses for students who are endorsed by their supervisors at their respective serving forces.

==Affiliation==
The National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education, an Independent Administrative Institution affiliated with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has recognised the courses and awards the graduates degrees on request. As the Academy is not an MEXT-recognised university, it cannot offer its own degrees.

<text>Emanuel Ninger (1846/1847 – July 25, 1924), known as &quot;Jim the Penman&quot;, was a counterfeiter in the late 1880s.

==Biography==
Ninger and his wife, Adelaide, arrived c. 1876 from Germany to live in Hoboken, New Jersey. He worked as a sign painter and then bought a farm in Westfield, New Jersey. He told his neighbors that he was receiving a pension from the Prussian army. On October 12, 1892 he moved to Flagtown, New Jersey.

==Forgery==

Ninger began counterfeiting in 1878, and by 1879 the Treasury redemption bureau was aware of his work. Not having any clues as to Ninger&#x27;s identity, he was named &quot;Jim the Penman&quot; by the Secret Service. Beginning with a $10 bill, he moved on to $20s and $50s, and later $100s. His first $100 was spotted by the Treasury in November 1893. Ninger would buy bond paper from Crane &amp; Company, in Dalton, Massachusetts, cut it to the same size as the $50 and $100 United States Notes he was copying, then soak the paper in a dilute coffee solution. He would align the paper over a genuine banknote, place the two on a piece of glass, and trace the resulting image. He used a camel’s hair brush to put colors on the note, imitated the silk threads with red and blue inks, and suggested rather than duplicated the intricate geometric lathework. Notably, he omitted the line crediting the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from all of his bills, and some of them were also missing the counterfeiting warning. When asked why he omitted the Bureau of Engraving and Printing credit on his bills, Ninger responded, &quot;Because dey [sic] didn&#x27;t make dem [sic].&quot;

He worked for weeks at a time on each note, and this was profitable because at the time one of those notes was extremely valuable (about $2,000 or $4,000 in today&#x27;s dollars).

He was apprehended by the United States Secret Service in March 1896 when he paid a bartender with a $50 banknote, the note got wet, and the ink began to smudge. Although first pleading not guilty, Ninger changed his plea to guilty, and was sentenced on May 29, 1896 to six years in the Erie County Penitentiary. At some point after his release he forged a few British pound notes. He died on July 25, 1924, at 77 years old.

Ninger was somewhat romanticized during his time, as almost a &quot;Robin Hood&quot;-like character, whose crimes were deemed &quot;victimless&quot;, both because only the extremely wealthy could afford the bills that he was forging, and also because with the proper art connections, one could stand to profit by receiving a Ninger work. Ninger notes are illegal to possess; it is estimated that there are 20-30 notes in the hands of collectors, out of an estimated 700 made by Ninger. One week before being sentenced, Ninger only admitted to making 390 notes over his 18-year career.

<doc id="771255" wikidata="Q618908" url="?curid=771255" title="Brian Dunkleman">
<text>Brian Dunkleman is an American comedian, actor, and television personality. He is best known as being co-host with Ryan Seacrest on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, in 2002.

==Career==

===&quot;American Idol&quot;===
In 2002, Dunkleman appeared as the co-host with Ryan Seacrest during the first season of &quot;American Idol.&quot; After the season ended, it was reported that Dunkleman had quit from co-hosting. Various news outlets later on said that he &quot;had his career completely destroyed&quot; for doing so, before it became enormously popular and made Seacrest very wealthy. However, one journalist believes that Dunkleman would have been fired had he not quit earlier, a fact numerous &quot;Idol&quot; staffers would eventually admit: Dunkleman had submitted his resignation shortly before news of his firing could reach him.

During his 2008 appearance on the sixth season of the reality television weight loss show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; on which he lost 15 pounds, and won the grand prize with his team, he spoke about his reasons for leaving &quot;American Idol&quot; following its first season. He stated his departure was due to the terrible way they treated the young contestants on the show, staging the fights between the judges and reshooting contestants with producer-provided glycerin tears in their eyes. He went on to say that leaving the show was a mistake. However, Ian K. Smith, one of the doctors on the panel, opined that he made the right decision.

In appearances on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, he had insisted that he intended to leave &quot;Idol&quot; to pursue a career in stand-up comedy and acting, but in 2008, Dunkleman admitted to Stern that he believed leaving the show was a mistake. Dunkleman conceded that he experienced several months of depression, and also still harbored resentment against current show host Ryan Seacrest, but has come to terms with his situation. Stern has compared Dunkleman to Pete Best of the Beatles and several other famous celebrities who chose to leave (or were forced to leave) successful show business careers, only to wind up as has-beens. In 2016, Dunkleman backtracked and said that the mutual decision to part ways was not a mistake on his part.

On April 7, 2016, Dunkleman appeared on the &quot;American Idol&quot; fifteenth season and (initial) series finale. In an interview following the show, Dunkleman said &quot;I think I beat them to the punch and I didn&#x27;t know. I left the show but from what I gather, they weren&#x27;t going to have me back anyway. So it&#x27;s kind of a big load off my shoulders. I guess I didn&#x27;t make a mistake. I didn&#x27;t do a good enough job and I don&#x27;t think I handled myself as professionally as I needed to back then.&quot;

===Other work===
In 2000, Dunkleman appeared in &quot;The One with the Ring&quot;, a sixth season episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, as the man who buys the engagement ring Chandler wants to buy Monica.

Dunkleman has also appeared in pilots for ABC and 20th Century Fox and guest-starred on the late-night talk show &quot;Talkshow with Spike Feresten&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; and &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. He had a recurring guest role on &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot;, played a stand-up comic suspected of murder in &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and appeared in an independent film called &quot;Comedy Hell&quot;.

His voice acting includes voicing himself in an episode of &quot;The Proud Family&quot;, in which the show parodied &quot;American Idol&quot;, did voices for the short-lived animated sitcom &quot;3-South&quot;, and playing Ruiga in the English dub of the Japanese anime series &quot;Naruto&quot;.

Dunkleman was a co-host with Eric the Actor on &quot;The Idol Re-cap Show&quot; on Sirius&#x27;s Howard 101. He also did voice over for the 1st season of &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot;.

Dunkleman played himself on an episode of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, hosting a reality contest show called &quot;Estrada or Nada&quot;, in which contestants show their skills in an &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;-esque show starring Erik Estrada. As Dunkleman ended a segment of the show he said, &quot;Dunkleman... out. Hack stole it from me.&quot;

Dunkleman was also parodied in the series finale of &quot;Drawn Together&quot;. In the episode, he was shown as an out of work and pretentious alcoholic and his inner dialogue expresses contempt of Seacrest&#x27;s last name, success and charisma. According to the on-screen captions, he &quot;declined to voice himself&quot;.

In 2009, Dunkleman pitched a TV series about his life after &quot;American Idol&quot; entitled &quot;American Dunkleman&quot;. The series is a fictional account of the actor-comic&#x27;s life, following the fictional Dunkleman as he tries to work his way back to the television industry, embarrassing himself and disappointing his friends while constantly being reminded that he &quot;could have been a millionaire&quot; had he stuck with &quot;Idol&quot;.

He does stand up regularly in Los Angeles at the Laugh Factory and The Improv, and he makes regular appearances as the host of &quot;Family Feud Live&quot; in Las Vegas and Atlantic City for Fremantle Media.

In November 2019, Dunkleman was on the third episode of Season 1 of the CNBC series &quot;Back in the Game&quot;, hosted by Alex Rodriguez.

In September 2021, Dunkleman started his own podcast called Dunklevision. His first guest was Justin Guarini.

==Personal life==
After a brief return to his hometown of Ellicottville, New York, in 2016, Dunkleman currently resides in Los Angeles. He is divorced and has one son.

<doc id="771262" wikidata="Q274918" url="?curid=771262" title="Grand National Assembly of Turkey">
<text>The Grand National Assembly of Turkey ( ), usually referred to simply as the TBMM or Parliament (), is the unicameral Turkish legislature. It is the sole body given the legislative prerogatives by the Turkish Constitution. It was founded in Ankara on 23 April 1920 amid the National Campaign. This constitution had founded its pre-government known as 1st Executive Ministers of Turkey (Commitment Deputy Committee) in May 1920. The parliament was fundamental in the efforts of &quot;Mareşal&quot; Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, 1st President of the Republic of Turkey, and his colleagues to found a new state out of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire.

== Composition ==
There are 600 members of parliament (deputies) who are elected for a five-year term by the D&#x27;Hondt method, a party-list proportional representation system, from 87 electoral districts which represent the 81 administrative provinces of Turkey (Istanbul and Ankara are divided into three electoral districts whereas İzmir and Bursa are divided into two each because of its large populations). To avoid a hung parliament and its excessive political fragmentation, from 1982 to 2022, a party must have won at least 10% of the national vote to qualify for representation in the parliament, but in 2022 this was reduced to 7%. As a result of the 10% threshold, only two parties won seats in the legislature after the 2002 elections and three in 2007. The 2002 elections saw every party represented in the previous parliament ejected from the chamber and parties representing 46.3% of the voter turnout were excluded from being represented in parliament. This threshold has been criticized, but a complaint with the European Court for Human Rights was turned down.

Independent candidates may also run and can be elected without needing a threshold.

=== Speaker of the parliament ===

A new term in the parliament began on 2 June 2023, after the 2023 general election. Devlet Bahçeli MHP temporarily served as the speaker, as it is customary for the oldest member of the TBMM to serve as speaker during a hung parliament. Numan Kurtulmuş was elected after the snap elections on 7 June 2023.

=== Languages ===
The parliament&#x27;s minutes are translated into the four languages: Arabic, Russian, English and French, but not in the Kurdish language which is the second most spoken native language in Turkey. Though phrases in the Kurdish language can be permitted, whole speeches remain forbidden.

=== Members (since 1999) ===
* Members elected in 1999 (21st Parliament)
* Members elected in 2002 (22nd Parliament)
* Members elected in 2007 (23rd Parliament)
* Members elected in 2011 (24th Parliament)
* Members elected in June 2015 (25th Parliament)
* Members elected in November 2015 (26th Parliament)
* Members elected in 2018 (27th Parliament)
* Members elected in 2023 (28th Parliament)

=== Parliamentary groups ===
Parties who have at least 20 deputies may form a parliamentary group. Currently there are six parliamentary groups at the GNAT: AK Party, which has the highest number of seats, CHP, MHP, Good Party, DEM, and New Path.

MPs can attend more than one committee if not a member of Petitions Committee or Planning and Budgeting Committee. Members of those committees can not participate in any other committees. On the other hand, MPs do not have to work for a committee either. Number of members of each committee is determined by the proposal of the Advisory Council and the approval of the General Assembly.

Sub committees are established according to the issue that the committee receives. Only State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) Committee has constant sub committees that are specifically responsible for a group of SOEs.

Committee meetings are open to the MPs, the Ministers&#x27; Board members and the Government representatives. The MPs and the Ministers&#x27; Board members can talk in the committees but can not make amendments proposals or vote. Every MP can read the reports of the committees.

NGOs can attend the committee meetings upon the invitation of the committee therefore volunteer individual or public participation is not available. Media, but not the visual media, can attend the meetings. The media representatives are usually the parliamentary staff of the media institutions. The committees can prevent the attendance of the media with a joint decision.

== Current composition ==
The 28th Parliament of Turkey took office on 2 June 2023, following the ratification of the results of the general election held on 14 May 2023. The composition of the 28th Parliament, is shown below.

== Parliament Building ==

The current Parliament Building is the third to house the nation&#x27;s parliament. The building which first housed the Parliament was converted from the Ankara headquarters of the Committee of Union and Progress. Designed by architect Hasip Bey, it was used until 1924 and is now used as the locale of the Museum of the War of Independence, the second building which housed the Parliament was designed by architect Vedat (Tek) Bey (1873–1942) and used from 1924 to 1960. It is now been converted as the Museum of the Republic. The Grand National Assembly is now housed in a modern and imposing building in the Bakanlıklar neighborhood of Ankara. The monumental building&#x27;s project was designed by architect and professor Clemens Holzmeister (1886–1993). The building was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50,000 lira banknotes of 1989–1999. The building was hit by airstrikes three times during the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, suffering noticeable damage. It went through a renovation in the summer of 2016.

==History==

Turkey has had a history of parliamentary government before the establishment of the current national parliament. These include attempts at curbing absolute monarchy during the Ottoman Empire through constitutional monarchy, as well as establishments of caretaker national assemblies immediately prior to the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 but after the &quot;de facto&quot; dissolution of the Ottoman Empire earlier in the decade.

=== Parliamentary practice before the Republican era ===

==== Ottoman Empire ====

There were two periods of parliamentary governance during the Ottoman Empire. The First Constitutional Era lasted for only two years, elections being held only twice. After the first elections, there were a number of criticisms of the government due to the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878 by the representatives, and the assembly was dissolved and an election called on 28 June 1877. The second assembly was also dissolved by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II on 14 February 1878, the result being the return of absolute monarchy with Abdul Hamid II in power and the suspension of the Ottoman constitution of 1876, which had come with the democratic reforms resulting in the First Constitutional Era.

The Second Constitutional Era began on 23 July 1908 with the Young Turk Revolution. The constitution that was written for the first parliament included control of the sultan on the public and was removed during 1909, 1912, 1914 and 1916, in a session known as the &quot;declaration of freedom&quot;. Most of the modern parliamentary rights that were not granted in the first constitution were granted, such as the abolition of the right of the Sultan to deport citizens that were claimed to have committed harmful activities, the establishment of a free press, a ban on censorship. Freedom to hold meetings and establish political parties was recognized, and the government was held responsible to the assembly, not to the sultan.

During the two constitutional eras of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman parliament was called the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire and was bicameral. The upper house was the Senate of the Ottoman Empire, the members of which were selected by the sultan. The role of the Grand Vizier, the centuries-old top ministerial office in the empire, transformed in line with other European states into one identical to the office of a prime minister, as well as that of the speaker of the Senate. The lower chamber of the General Assembly was the Chamber of Deputies of the Ottoman Empire, the members of which were elected by the general public.

==== Establishment of the National Assembly ====
After World War I, the victorious Allied Powers sought the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire through the Treaty of Sèvres. The sovereign existence of the Turkish nation was to be eliminated under these plans, except for a small region. Nationalist Turkish sentiment rose in the Anatolian peninsula, engendering the establishment of the Turkish national movement. The political developments during this period have made a lasting impact which continues to affect the character of the Turkish nation. During the Turkish War of Independence, Mustafa Kemal put forth the notion that there would be only one way for the liberation of the Turkish people in the aftermath of World War I, namely, through the creation of an independent, sovereign Turkish state. The Sultanate was abolished by the newly founded parliament in 1922, paving the way for the formal proclamation of the republic that was to come on 29 October 1923.

==== Transition to Ankara ====
Mustafa Kemal, in a speech he made on 19 March 1920 announced that &quot;an Assembly will be gathered in Ankara that will possess extraordinary powers&quot; and communicated how the members who would participate in the assembly would be elected and the need to realise elections, at the latest, within 15 days. He also stated that the members of the dispersed Ottoman Chamber of Deputies could also participate in the assembly in Ankara, to increase the representative power of the parliament. These elections were held as planned, in the style of the elections of the preceding Chamber of Deputies, in order to select the first members of the new Turkish assembly. This &quot;Grand National Assembly&quot;, established on national sovereignty, held its inaugural session on 23 April 1920. From this date until the end of the Turkish War of Independence in 1923, the provisional government of Turkey was known as the Government of the Grand National Assembly.

=== Republican era ===

==== 1923–1945 ====



The first trial of multi-party politics, during the republican era, was made in 1924 by the establishment of the Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fırkası (Progressive Republican Party) at the request of Mustafa Kemal, which was closed after several months. Following a 6-year one-party rule, after the foundation of the Serbest Fırka (Liberal Party) by Ali Fethi Okyar, again at the request of Mustafa Kemal, in 1930, some violent disorders took place, especially in the eastern parts of the country. The Liberal Party was dissolved on 17 November 1930 and no further attempt at a multiparty democracy was made until 1945.

==== 1945–1960 ====

The multi-party period in Turkey was resumed by the founding of the National Development Party (&quot;Milli Kalkınma Partisi&quot;), by Nuri Demirağ, in 1945. The Democrat Party was established the following year, and won the general elections of 1950; one of its leaders, Celal Bayar, becoming President of the Republic and another, Adnan Menderes, Prime Minister.

==== 1960–1980 ====
After the a military coup on 27 May 1960, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, President Celal Bayar, and all the ministers and members of the Assembly were arrested. The Assembly was closed. The Committee of National Unity, CNU &quot;(Milli Birlik Komitesi), &quot;assumed all the powers of the Assembly by a provisional constitution and began to run the country. Executive power was used by ministers appointed by the CNU.

The members of the CNU began to work on a new and comprehensive constitution. The Constituent Assembly &quot;(Kurucu Meclis), &quot;composed of members of the CNU and the members of the House of Representatives, was established to draft a new constitution on 6 January 1961. The House of Representatives consisted of those appointed by the CNU, representatives designated by two parties of that time (CHP and Republican Villagers National Party, RVNP), and representatives of various professional associations.

The constitutional text drafted by the Constituent Assembly was presented to the voters in a referendum on 9 July 1961, and was accepted by 61.17% of the voters. The 1961 Constitution, the first prepared by a Constituent Assembly and the first to be presented to the people in a referendum, included innovations in many subjects.

The 1961 Constitution stipulated a typical parliamentarian system. According to the Constitution, Parliament was bicameral. The legislative power was vested in the House of Representatives and the Senate. while the executive authority was vested in the President and the Council of Ministers. The Constitution envisaged a Constitutional Court.

The 1961 Constitution regulated fundamental rights and freedom, including economic and social rights, over a wide spectrum and adopted the principles of a democratic social state and the rule of law. The 1961 Constitution underwent many comprehensive changes after the military memorandum of 12 March 1971, but continued to be in force until the military coup of 1980.

==== 1980–2018 ====
The country underwent another military coup on 12 September 1980. The Constitution was suspended and political parties were dissolved. Many politicians were forbidden from entering politics again. The military power ruling the country established a &quot;Constituent Assembly&quot;, as had been done in 1961. The Constituent Assembly was composed of the National Security Council and the Advisory Assembly. Within two years, the new constitution was drafted and was presented to the referendum on 7 November 1982. Participation in the referendum was 91.27%. As a result, the 1982 Constitution was passed with 91.37% of the votes.

The greatest change brought about by the 1982 Constitution was the unicameral parliamentary system. The number of MPs were 550 members. The executive was empowered and new and more definite limitations were introduced on fundamental rights and freedoms. Also, a 10% electoral threshold was introduced. Except for these aspects, the 1982 Constitution greatly resembled the 1961 Constitution.

The 1982 Constitution, from the time it was accepted until the present time, has undergone many changes, especially the &quot;integration laws&quot;, which have been introduced within the framework of the European Union membership process, and which has led to a fundamental evolution.

====2018–present====
After the 2017 constitutional referendums, the first general election of the Assembly was under a presidential system, with an executive president who has the power to renew the elections for the Assembly and vice versa. Following the referendum, the number of MPs increased from 550 to 600. Furthermore, due to separation of powers, members of the cabinet can&#x27;t introduce laws anymore. This task is left to the parliamentarians. In line with this change, the seats for the members of the cabinet have been removed from the parliament. These seats were originally located on the left side of the Parliament Speaker.

In 2022, at the initiative of the ruling AK Party and its main political ally MHP, the national electoral threshold for a party to enter parliament was lowered from 10 to 7 percent.

<text>Lo Barnechea is a commune located in the northeastern sector of the province of Santiago and its area corresponds to 48% of this province. Its urban boundaries are: to the north with Los Andes of the Valparaíso region, to the west with Colina, to the southwest with Vitacura and Huechuraba, to the south with Las Condes and to the east with San José de Maipo. It developed around the old rural town of Lo Barnechea. Its population is heterogeneous, as it is inhabited by high- and medium-high-income families in sectors such as La Dehesa, Los Trapenses and El Arrayán, and also by medium-low- and low-income families, mainly in the towns of Lo Barnechea, Población La Ermita and Cerro Dieciocho.

== History ==
Lo Barnechea has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. Before the Incas, it was occupied by the Llolleo culture and the Bato tradition, and after them, the Aconcagua culture, the Promaucaes, the Incas and later the Spanish occupation.

Its pre-Hispanic inhabitants were called &quot;huaicoches&quot; (in Mapudungún: &quot;waykoche&quot; &#x27;people who live in a landslide zone&#x27;) because of the &quot;huaicos&quot; or &quot;huaycos&quot; of the region (in Quechua: &quot;wayqu&quot; &#x27;stream&#x27;). Also called &quot;lloclla&quot; (in Quechua: &quot;lluqlla&quot; &#x27;alluvium&#x27;), these are violent alluvial floods in which a large amount of material from the slopes is dislodged and dragged by the water downstream to the bottom of the valleys, causing enormous burial sites in its path. In modern scientific terms, according to the Multinational Andean Project, a &quot;huayco&quot; is known as a debris flow, or debris flow. A &quot;huayco&quot; is caused by the violent fall of water, which drags mud, stones, trees and anything else in its path. Its origin may be due to an intense rainfall or the overflowing of a river or lagoon at high altitudes.

The town of Lo Barnechea was created in the 19th century. So far, it has resisted conurbation with Greater Santiago.

The DFL 1-3260 of 9 March 1981 established the new commune of Lo Barnechea, from a subdivision of the commune of Las Condes; however, until 1991, it was part of the communal grouping managed by the Municipality of Las Condes. By Decree with Force of Law No. 32-18.992 of 20 May 1991, the Municipality of Lo Barnechea was officially established, the same day as its neighbor Vitacura.

=== Cityscape ===

The urban center of Lo Barnechea is located in the areas below 1,000 meters above sea level, in the basin of the Mapocho River and the valley of La Dehesa. Its neighborhoods are composed of affluent sectors such as Los Trapenses, La Dehesa and El Huinganal (&quot;Molle Schinus polygamus, in Mapudungún Huingan&quot;), El Tranque, and middle class sectors such as the traditional Pueblo de Lo Barnechea, Cerro 18, San Enrique and El Arrayán.

Many of its streets recall the old alleys owned by the seven founding families. El León Street recalls the old Parador and Hostería de El León, which used to welcome miners after their long days of work. On this street lived the Salfate sisters, now deceased, who knew the history of the town and its inhabitants: Blanca and Irene Griselda. Their stories about the mythical trips to the Laguna del Viento in the foothills of the Andes and the local mythology enlivened the village&#x27;s social gatherings in the afternoons.

Towards the northwest there are neighborhoods with Spanish names: the Chin street that remembers the owner of the parcel with the surname Echeñique. In the Trapenses area, many of the landmarks of this congregation, which for many years was in this commune before selling its land for the capital gain, are remembered. Currently, at the end of the Trapenses there is a road that connects La Dehesa with the Chicureo sector and at the end of the road El Golf de Manquehue connects it with the unpopulated area of Huechuraba.

== Economy ==
In 2018, the number of registered companies in Lo Barnechea was 10,072. The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) in the same year was 1.01, while the economic activities with the highest Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index were Retail Sale of Underwear and Personal Wear (42.14), Dance Instructors (27.49) and Amusement Parks and Similar Centers Activities (18.79).

==Demographics==
According to the 2017 census of the National Statistics Institute, Lo Barnechea spans an area of and has 105,833 inhabitants (50,500 men and 55,333 women). Of these, 103,134 (97.4%) lived in urban areas and 2,699 (2.6%) in rural areas. The population grew by 41.58% (31,084 persons) between the 2002 and 2017 censuses. The 2024 projected population was 131,053.

== Administration ==

* Juana Mir Balmaceda (Evópoli)

== Architecture ==

The architecture in the area of buildings is very scarce, with a few late colonial style houses located preferably in the so-called Pueblo de Lo Barnechea. As regards the commercial area, there are the shopping centers Portal La Dehesa, Espacio Urbano La Dehesa, Paseo Los Trapenses and Mall Vivo Los Trapenses. Also noteworthy is the large number of mansions and luxury homes that are established in this commune, especially in the sectors of Arrayán, Los Trapenses and La Dehesa, being these of various styles built mainly during the last twenty years and belonging to the so-called &quot;upper class&quot; of the country, making up one of the areas with the highest average housing prices in Chile. 

In parallel to the construction of houses and luxury apartments, social housing was developed in Lo Barnechea, in addition to the processes of self-construction of the founding tenants of the town, along with their generations. For the same reason, in the commune of Lo Barnechea we can see a series of contrasts, not only architectural, but also of social character, given that in a few square meters, or crossing a street (Padre Alfredo Arteaga Barros with Comandante Malbec), neighborhoods of high socioeconomic strata can be seen, in opposition to sectors of low social strata, clearly delimited between them.

== Transportation ==
The commune has a low connection to the interconnected public transport of the city, consequently and being located at one end of the metropolitan area, together with Vitacura it leads the rate of motorization per capita (motor vehicles per inhabitant) in Greater Santiago. It was expected that by 2020, Lo Barnechea will have 3 stations of the Las Condes Tramway, which would give it a historic connection to the Santiago Metro, being currently one of the three communes of Greater Santiago (along with La Pintana and Lo Espejo) that does not have stations of the metropolitan railroad. However, the project was canceled by the authorities for not having the necessary subsidies for its execution.

Lo Barnechea was also part of the Transantiago feeder zone C, together with the districts of Providencia, Las Condes and Vitacura. It is currently served by units 4 and 6 of this transportation system.

There is an elevator on Cerro 18 operated by the Municipality of Lo Barnechea that connects this sector with Los Quincheros Street and the top of the hill, where the Parque de la Chilenidad is located.

== Climate ==

In general terms, Lo Barnechea participates in the semi-arid Mediterranean climate that affects the Metropolitan Region, characterized by a prolonged dry season and a winter season, which concentrates annual rainfall. 

* &quot;Annual rainfall&quot; 360 mm
* &quot;Average temperature&quot; 14 °C
* &quot;Average Maximum Temperature&quot; 22 °C
* &quot;Average Minimum Temperature&quot; 7 °C

These climatic patterns present, in this commune, very important variations due to its condition as a foothill area, subjected to the altitude factor. It is estimated that in a mountainous environment, rainfall increases by about 22 mm every 100 m of altitude, while the temperature decreases by about 0.5 °C every 100 m. According to this, being the urban area of the town of Lo Barnechea located at 850 m a.s.l., it receives 65 mm more rainfall than in the commune of Santiago. This varies according to the size of the rural territory of the commune. In the annual distribution of rainfall, and considering the entire mountainous area, when it rains several days in a row, large flows are produced in the riverbeds, which causes flooding by accumulation and its consequent transfer according to slopes (1982-84-87). The impact was regrettable, with loss of life, interruption of activities, damage to infrastructure and equipment, due to the permanence of inhabitants on the banks of the Mapocho River.

In addition to the reality of the Mapocho River and its location, there is a natural climatic event that will have to be taken into account in planning the future population of the Commune.

== Flood of 1982 ==
The incursion of warm winter fronts in 1982 caused a rise in the lower limit of the snowpack, from 1800 to 2400 m above sea level, generating a large increase in the volume of water and sediment runoff, resulting from the melting of snow, which caused saturation and subsequent overflow of the natural and artificial water drainage systems.

The repetition of a similar event, under the current conditions of occupation and urban expansion in Lo Barnechea, could cause even more catastrophic situations, due to the high degree of intervention and modification to which the natural system has been subjected by the construction that has taken place on increasingly higher ground.

<text>Rana Saddam Hussein () (born 25 July 1969) is the second-eldest daughter of the former President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein and his first wife, Sajida Talfah. Her older sister is Raghad and younger sister is Hala.

==Biography==

In 1986, she married Saddam Kamel al-Majid, brother of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, her elder sister Raghad&#x27;s husband. She has four children. She accompanied her husband to Jordan in 1995, where she lived from 8 August of that year to 20 February 1996. They returned to Iraq after receiving assurances from Saddam Hussein that he would pardon Kamel and his brother, Hussein Kamel al-Majid. Despite this promise, before the end of the month, both Saddam Kamel al-Majid and Hussein Kamel al-Majid were shot and killed by other clan members who declared them traitors. 

In 1997, her brother Uday Hussein put Rana and her sister Raghad under house arrest for involvement in a plot to assassinate him.

On 31 July 2003, she went back to Jordan, where King Abdullah granted her family asylum. 

As of 2023, she still lives in Jordan.

<doc id="771283" wikidata="Q5090524" url="?curid=771283" title="Chemigation valve">
<text>Sometimes called a check valve or a backflow preventer, a chemigation valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. Most chemigation valves consist of a spring-loaded check valve, a low pressure drain, an air and vacuum relief valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve. Many chemigation valves also have a 4-inch inspection port so that a person can reach inside and feel if the check valve is still functional. Some governments require the use of two chemigation valves installed in series if hazardous chemicals are to be injected.

The following policies require or encourage the installation of these valves:

Texas State law Chapter 344.73 in Subchapter D - 1.(b) 
: &quot;An irrigation system which adds any chemical is considered to be a &#x27;high health hazard&#x27;. Such an irrigation system must not be connected to any potable water supply except through a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.&quot;

Florida&#x27;s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Water Quality/Quantity Best Management Practices for Florida Specialty Fruit and Nut Crops p. 20 specifies that:
: &quot;Backflow prevention should include a check valve between the irrigation pump and the injection device to prevent backward flow; a low-pressure drain to prevent seepage past the check valve; a vacuum relief valve to ensure that a siphon cannot develop; and a check valve on the injection line.&quot;

<doc id="771284" wikidata="Q399673" url="?curid=771284" title="Agüeybaná I">
<text>Agüeybaná (died 1510) was the principal and most powerful &quot;cacique&quot; (chief) of the Kalinago people in Borikén, modern-day Puerto Rico, when the Spanish first arrived on the island on November 19, 1493.

==Etymology==
&quot;Agüeybana&quot;, which has been interpreted by 19th and 20th century authors as meaning &quot;The Great Sun&quot;, was the hereditary title shared by the family that ruled the theocratic monarchy of Borikén, governing the hierarchy over the rest of the regional chiefs or caciques. Like other nobiliary recognitions within Kalinago culture, it was passed down through the maternal bloodline. The Spanish settlers Hispanicized the title to be the equivalent of the European concept of kings, with contemporary writers such as Juan de Castellanos and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés employing the title of &quot;Rey Agüeybana&quot; (English: &quot;King Agüeybana&quot;) when referring to the second monarch to lead the Taíno during the 1510s. By the 1800s, the terms &quot;king&quot; and &quot;cacique&quot; were used exchangeably by both local and Spanish authors, but a resurgence in the interest concerning Kalinago history during the 20th century led to the popularization of native words and the latter term gained more lexical prominence.

== Arrival of the conquistadors ==
Agüeybaná received the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León upon his arrival in 1508. According to an old Taíno tradition, Agüeybaná practiced the &quot;guatiao,&quot; a Taíno ritual in which he and Juan Ponce de León became friends and exchanged names. Ponce de León then baptized the cacique&#x27;s mother into Christianity and renamed her Inés.

The cacique joined Ponce de León in the exploration of the island. After this had been accomplished, Agüeybaná accompanied the conquistador to the island of &quot;La Española&quot; (what today comprises the nations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti), where he was well received by the Governor Nicolás de Ovando. Agüeybaná&#x27;s actions helped to maintain the peace between the Taíno and the Spaniards, a peace which was to be short-lived.
The hospitality and friendly treatment that the Spaniards received from Agüeybaná made it easy for the Spaniards to betray and conquer the island. After a short period of peace, the Taínos were forced to work in the island&#x27;s gold mines and in the construction of forts as slaves. Many Taínos died as a result of the cruel treatment which they received.

== Death and aftermath==
Upon Agüeybaná&#x27;s death in 1510, his brother Güeybaná (better known as Agüeybaná II) became the most powerful Cacique in the island. Agüeybaná II was troubled by the treatment of his people by the Spanish and attacked them in battle. The Taíno were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Yagüecas.

Taínos in Puerto Rico either abandoned the island, were forced to labor as slaves; others were killed off by Spaniard artillery- in what was thought to be, until recently, a complete extinction.

Recent genetic studies published between 2018 and 2019 revealed that Taino blood ancestry is still present in the genome of Puerto Ricans. The analyses revealed a narrative more indicative of assimilation and migrations to nearby islands rather than extinction. Although many succumbed to the smallpox epidemic that attacked the islanders in 1519, others survived the genetic bottleneck to produce progeny. 

==Legacy==
Agüeybaná is admired in Puerto Rico for his dedication to his people and attempting to keep the peace. Puerto Rico has named many public buildings and streets after him:
* The City of Bayamón has named a high school after him.
* There is a street in Caguas that honors him.
* An avenue in the Hato Rey area of San Juan is named after Agüeybaná.
* Puerto Rico once had an equivalent to the Grammy Award which was awarded annually and was called the &quot;Agüeybaná de Oro&quot; (The Golden Agüeybaná), in honor of the great cacique.

Many songs and poems, by poets such as Juan Antonio Corretjer, among others, have been written about Agüeybaná.

<text>Wilhelm Heinrich Solf (5 October 1862 – 6 February 1936) was a German scholar, diplomat, jurist and statesman.

==Early life==
Solf was born into a wealthy and liberal family in Berlin. He attended secondary schools in Anklam, western Pomerania, and in Mannheim. He took up the study of Oriental languages, in particular Sanskrit, at universities in Berlin, Göttingen and Halle and earning a doctorate in philology in the winter of 1885. Under the supervision of the well-known Indologist Richard Pischel, Solf wrote an elementary grammar of Sanskrit.

Solf then found a position at the library of the University of Kiel. While residing there, he was drafted into the Imperial Navy to serve his military obligation. However, he was deemed medically unfit for military service and discharged.

==Early diplomatic career==
Solf joined the German Foreign Office (Consular Service) on 12 December 1888 and was assigned to the Imperial German Consulate General in Calcutta on 1 January 1889. However, he resigned from the consular service after three years to study law at the University of Jena, where he obtained his doctorate in law (&quot;Doktor juris&quot;) in September 1896. Solf&#x27;s advanced degrees qualified him for higher positions in the diplomatic service. He joined the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office (&quot;Kolonialabteilung des Auswärtigen Amtes&quot;) and in 1898 was assigned as district judge in Dar es Salaam in German East Africa for a short period. In 1899, he was posted to the Samoan Islands, where he served as council chairman in the provisional government of the municipality of Apia, Samoa.

==Governor of Samoa==
The division of the Samoan Islands as a result of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 assigned the western islands to Germany (independent Samoa today) and Eastern Samoa to the United States (American Samoa today). Wilhelm Solf, at age 38, became the first Governor of German Samoa on 1 March 1900. &quot;Solf was a man of quite unusual talent, clear-thinking, sensitive to the nuances of Samoan attitudes and opinion.&quot; He was known as a liberal, painstaking and competent administrator. Solf included Samoan traditions in his government programs but never hesitated to step in assertively, including banishment from Samoa in severe cases, when his position as the &quot;Kaiser&#x27;s&quot; deputy was challenged. Under Solf&#x27;s direction, plantation agriculture was further encouraged, which in his judgment provided the soundest basis for the colony&#x27;s economic development. In turn, tax revenues were enhanced, making the establishment of a public school system, the construction and the staffing of a hospital major successes. Road and harbour facilities development was accelerated. The Samoan colony was on its way to self-sufficiency and had reached that achievement just before Solf was called to Berlin and was succeeded by Erich Schultz as Governor of German Samoa.

==Later career==
After his return from Samoa, Solf became (1911) Secretary (&quot;Staatssekretär&quot;) of the German Colonial Office (&quot;Reichskolonialamt&quot;) to 1918 and travelled extensively to the German protectorates in West and East Africa in 1912 and 1913. In the spring of 1914, Solf designed coats of arms for the various German colonies, a project which found enthusiastic favour with Wilhelm II, but his efforts were foiled by the outbreak of World War I a few months later, and the arms were never officially used. The outbreak of World War I caused Germany&#x27;s colonial possessions to be invaded by the United Kingdom (including the dominions), Belgium, France and Japan.

Solf lobbied for a negotiated peace settlement in 1917 and 1918. He opposed the implementation of unrestricted submarine warfare, a policy that eventually contributed to the entry of the United States to the war in 1917.

With the defeat of Germany imminent and the likelihood of revolution growing, he was appointed as what turned out to be the last of the Imperial Foreign Ministers in October 1918. In that capacity, he undertook negotiations for the armistice that took effect on 11 November 1918.

He resigned his post as Foreign Minister on 13 December 1918 with the onset of the German Revolution after news about the payment of about 1-million Mark and a 10.5-million Russian ruble mandate for a bank account at Mendelssohn &amp; Co by the Russian ambassador to Germany, Adolph Joffe, to the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany politician Oskar Cohn had become public. Solf refused further co-operation with the USPD.

Between then and 1920, he served as Vice President of the &quot;Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft&quot;. From 1920 to 1928, he served as the German chargé d&#x27;affaires and then ambassador to Japan; his tenure proved to be fruitful, as he was instrumental in restoring good relations between the two World War I enemies, which culminated in the signing of the German-Japanese Treaty of 1927. On Solf&#x27;s return to Germany and his retirement from government service, he became the Chairman of the Board of the based in Stuttgart.

Solf held centrist political views and joined the German Democratic Party (&quot;Deutsche Demokratische Partei&quot;). However, with its dissolution in 1933, he planned with others to form a new moderate party. With the Nazi reality of that time, it was unsuccessful, if not impossible. In 1932, he supported the re-election of retired Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg as German President.

Solf wrote &quot;Weltpolitik und Kolonialpolitik&quot; (Foreign policy and colonial policy, 1918) and &quot;Kolonialpolitik, Mein politisches Vermächtniss&quot; (Colonial policy, my political legacy, 1919).

== Personal life ==
In 1908 Wilhelm Solf married Johanna Dotti; their children were:

* daughter So&#x27;oa&#x27;emalelagi Solf (known as Lagi), born in Samoa in 1909 (d. 14 Dec 1955). Her Samoan name translates as &quot;she who has come from heaven&quot;.
* son Hans Heinrich Solf (21 Dec 1910 - 18 Feb 1987)
* son Wilhelm Herman Solf (11 Jan 1915 - August 1983)
* son Otto Isao Solf (25 Dec 1921 - 12 Aug 1989)

Solf&#x27;s widow Johanna (Hanna) and his daughter Lagi hosted the anti-Nazi Frau Solf Tea Party get-togethers.

<text>Chamber (Jonothon Evan Starsmore; alternatively spelled Jonothan) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually associated with the X-Men and the New Warriors.

A British mutant, Jono possesses the ability to cast energy blasts from his chest. He had limited control of his power and destroyed much of his chest and lower face when his powers emerged. He lost his powers on M-Day, but replaced them with technology that gave him sonic-based abilities. He regained his powers after the events of Age of X.

Jonothon was a member of the X-Men junior team Generation X. He was sullen and moody and had difficulty bonding with teammates. He has since been offered a permanent position in the X-Men&#x27;s teaching staff.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Chris Bachalo, he first appeared in &quot;Generation X&quot; #1 (November 1994).

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===

Jonothon Evan Starsmore (&quot;Jono&quot; to his friends) is a native of London and a mutant who possesses a furnace of psionic energy in his chest. This power first manifested in an explosion during a party he was attending with his then-girlfriend Gayle Edgerton, crippling Gayle and destroying Jonothon&#x27;s chest and lower face. As a result, he is unable to speak normally and can only do so via telepathy. He does not eat, drink, or breathe; it is believed that he is sustained by or made entirely of psionic energy. This is further supported by the fact that Jono is immune to the &quot;Death Factor&quot; of Omega Red, meaning that he is not sustained by &quot;&quot;.

The primary manifestation of his abilities is his ability to fire powerful blasts of psionic force. It has been implied at numerous times that he has the potential to become one of the most powerful mutants on Earth, but his emotional issues have apparently prevented him from significantly exploring this potential. His disfiguration also left Jono sullen and angry and his teammates have often found him difficult to get along with.

===Generation X===
Shortly after his mutant powers manifested, Jonothon accepted an invitation to join Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters. At the airport, he was attacked by Emplate, a vicious evil mutant who feeds on mutant genetic material to survive, and the fledgling team of Generation X arrived to fight Emplate off. Shortly after, Chamber convinced the crazed Penance to stop attacking the team, as he could sympathize with her freakish appearance; she came to live with the team.

Subsequently, Chamber reconciles with Gayle and enters a relationship with Husk. Unfortunately, the relationship was strained as Jono often sabotaged the relationship, believing he could not offer her the normalcy he assumed she wanted. And despite the mutual attraction, future attempts to restart their relationship failed, as Jono&#x27;s insecurities were always a hindrance. These issues also negatively impacted their ability to interact as platonic teammates.

Jono&#x27;s greatest victory during the time he was with Generation X was when Banshee was attacked by the mutant serial killer Omega Red. With their teacher incapacitated, Chamber led the pursuit of the mutant and after the rest of the team was defeated, Chamber&#x27;s immunity to Omega Red&#x27;s death spores, as well as some tactical thinking on his part, enabled him to single-handedly defeat the killer.

Despite his time at the school, Jono was never able to gain full control of his abilities. Chamber grew even more depressed when he saw that Synch, who could duplicate a nearby mutant&#x27;s powers, was more proficient with Chamber&#x27;s own powers than Chamber himself was. When the school was outed as harboring mutant students, an anti-mutant group attacked the school. After Synch was killed preventing a bomb from killing nearby human students, the Generation X kids felt that their training was over, and they had to use their powers to help humanity. Chamber was the one student to be offered a place on the X-Men by Charles Xavier, but apparently failed to join the group when expected.

===X-Man and Weapon X===

After failing to join the X-Men, Chamber returned to London, where he hooked up with pop star Sugar Kane, creating a publicity blitz for the singer, but she and Chamber parted company after her manager staged her abduction by anti-mutant forces following a phony tabloid story about her pregnancy by Jono. The X-Men met with Chamber in London and persuaded him to join the team after all, after claiming that the X-Men offered a place that he could finally fit in. He remained on the team for some time, but often showed frustration with being treated as a junior member by his teammates, even after playing a role in the defeat of Vanisher and Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants when they infiltrated Banshee&#x27;s X-Corps.

Following a strained time on the X-Men, Chamber investigated the apparent murders of mutant students at Empire State University on their behalf. He became romantically entangled with the shapeshifting reptilian mutant, Amber, who was the only mutant student to remain at ESU when they shut down their mutant program, but the relationship quickly ended before it began when Amber came to believe he was only interested in her when she used her shape-shifting abilities to take on a more conventionally attractive form. After that he asked to be relieved from active duty with the X-Men, claiming that he still had much to learn.

While he was back at the school, Chamber saw Husk in the arms of Archangel. He also saw the death of his friend Skin after the mutant was crucified on the lawn of the school by the Church of Humanity. After an awkward period with Husk, the X-Men were called to a bar where Jono had apparently given into his anger. He attacked Archangel before Wolverine was able to subdue him. Chamber was turned over to the authorities and while in prison, locked in a power-dampening helmet, Chamber received a visit from Brent Jackson, who offered him an invitation to join the Weapon X program. He accepted. It was later revealed that the fight and public falling out with the X-Men had been planned to draw Weapon X into recruiting him. After infiltrating them, Weapon X restored his damaged body and he was sent on a mission to kill John Sublime. He apparently did so, convincing Weapon X of his loyalty, but after stowing aboard a transport to the Neverland concentration camp, he vanished. It was later revealed in the &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot; miniseries that Chamber had been captured and brainwashed into loyalty to the program.

In the second &quot;Runaways&quot; series, it initially appeared Jono had damaged his face again and joined a new team of retired teenage superheroes called Excelsior, but it was revealed that this was merely Geoffrey Wilder, an enemy of the Runaways, impersonating him via a magic amulet.

===Decimation===

Chamber is one of many mutants who lost their powers to Scarlet Witch following M-Day. This leaves him unable to survive normally and forces him to be put on life support. However, he is abducted and healed by Clan Akkaba member Frederick Slade and transformed into a grey-skinned form resembling his distant ancestor Apocalypse. A later scan of Jono&#x27;s residual energy signature has revealed that his powers have possibly evolved to Omega-level. However, if Chamber has any such abilities, they appear to be latent.

===New Warriors===

Jono resurfaced as Decibel, a member of Night Thrasher&#x27;s most recent incarnation of the New Warriors. In this new persona, Jono had a hi-tech suit, which gave him the ability to create solidified sound constructs. He revealed that he chose those powers because he did not want to be a weapon of destruction anymore and could now create. He served with the group for the duration, until it was decided that they should disband. He was last seen departing in the company of Jubilee, and other surviving members of the team.

===Age of X===
Jono eventually made his way to the X-Men&#x27;s new Island nation of Utopia. Shortly after his arrival, one of the split-personalities of Xavier&#x27;s son Legion re-wrote the history of the X-Men turning himself into a hero. In this re-written world, Jono was once again referred to as Chamber and had regained his lost mutant powers, but also lost the body restorations given to him by Clan Akkaba. When normality was finally restored, Jono was one of the few X-Men who retained their physical changes from this altered reality. Now once again in possession of a gaping hole in his chest and jaw, Jono submitted to observation by the X-Men&#x27;s resident biologist, Kavita Rao.

===Schism===
Chamber is mentioned by the Stepford Cuckoos as responding to a Sentinel threat in Berlin alongside Warpath. After the conflict of leaders between Wolverine and Cyclops, Chamber chose to join Wolverine at the new X-Mansion, now the &quot;Jean Grey School for Higher Learning&quot;.

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
Chamber is now teaching a course on &quot;Coping With Physical Changes&quot; at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Chamber is entrusted with the safety and security of the students when a violent threat is roaming the halls. He is shown defending his students from an attack by Weapon Omega while giving a lecture in class. Chamber is killed while battling one of Legion&#x27;s multiple personalities, but is later resurrected by Legion. When the school moves to Central Park, Chamber becomes a teacher there before being killed by Harpoon of the Marauders.

===Krakoa===
Following the establishment of Krakoa as a mutant nation, Chamber is resurrected and joins the New Mutants along with Mondo. They went on a mission to the Shi&#x27;ar Empire with the intent of bringing Cannonball to Krakoa. They were eventually made to transport Deathbird to Chandilar to be Majestrix Xandra Neramani&#x27;s teacher, avoiding an assassination attempt by Oracle. He was later seen working with Nightcrawler&#x27;s Legionaries.

==Powers and abilities==
Jono&#x27;s thoracic and abdominal cavities are a chamber for a furnace of psionic energy capable of nuclear fission whose output can be projected as wide blasts of concussive force or laser-like focused beams that disrupt atomic bonds. The initial manifestation of said powers has destroyed most of his internal organs along with his mouth and chest, effectively killing his body. Chamber requires no food or oxygen and is seemingly indestructible as he has disintegrated his own body along with D&#x27;spayre&#x27;s down to their sub-atomic components in a kamikaze attack and later reconstituted himself.

Jono&#x27;s appearance is so unusual that even other mutants are startled and repulsed. His bizarre physiology suggests he is actually a being of pure psionic energy inhabiting a dead organic shell that he can disintegrate and reassemble from memory, a hypothesis several characters have put forward in comics. Chamber can also project his thoughts into other people&#x27;s minds, but cannot read the thoughts of others, which enables him to communicate without a mouth. At one point, fellow Generation X member Synch used his own mutant powers to tap into and copy Jono&#x27;s powers and fly. Jono himself has never exhibited this ability before or since.

After being depowered by the events of &quot;House of M&quot;, Jono&#x27;s body was rebuilt by Clan Akkaba in the image of Apocalypse and he later employed technology to mimic sonic powers as Decibel. These powers included flight, sonic blasts and the creation of solid energy constructs. He has since been restored to his original form and powers by the events of Age of X.

==Reception==
In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Chamber 35th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

== Other versions ==

===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate universe variant of Chamber from Earth-295 appears in &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;. This version is the leader of Generation X whose body remains intact due to him receiving a cybernetic chest plate that regulates his powers. He is later killed by a mob during an attack on Sugar Man&#x27;s lair.

===Amalgam Comics===
Jonothon Hex, a fusion of Chamber and DC Comics character Jonah Hex, appears in the Amalgam Comics one-shot &quot;Generation Hex&quot;.

===Future X-Men===
An alternate universe variant of Chamber from Earth-13729 appears in &quot;Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme&quot; #10 and &quot;Uncanny X-Men: Winters End&quot; #1. This version is in a relationship with Husk and is later killed in a battle with the Shi&#x27;ar.

<doc id="771320" wikidata="Q6156568" url="?curid=771320" title="Japan Coast Guard Academy">
<text>The (JCGA) is a university-level service academy established within the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for the purpose of developing Coast Guard Officers. It is located in Kure, Hiroshima prefecture.

The cadets and officer candidates learn specialized knowledge on international maritime law, naval police theory, maritime traffic policy, in a rigorous 4 year and 9 month curriculum unique to the Academy.

Graduates of JCGA go out into the fleet as junior officers, alternatively working at land-based offices and Coast Guard vessels as they advance in their careers.

==Charter==
The purpose of the JCGA is stipulated in Article 255 of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Organization Ordinance reads as follows:

==Admissions==
Cadets are typically selected from recent graduates of Japanese civilian senior high schools who have completed twelve years of formal schooling. Applicants must pass the recruitment examination, equivalent level as entrance examination required for a public university, but unlike a regular university, students who enter JCGA become cadets serving in the Japan Coast Guard. The applicant must meet the requirements for becoming an officer in the Coast Guard, such as age and Japanese nationality, which differ from the requirements for general university applicants. The cost of tuition is paid by the Japanese government and both cadets and officer candidates receive a stipend as civil servants (as of 2024, about ¥160,000 per month for cadets and ¥190,000 per month for officer candidates), as with cadets at the National Defense Academy of Japan, National Defense Medical College, and the United States Coast Guard Academy.

In 2021, JCGA began to recruit university graduates as officer candidates. Unlike the United States Coast Guard, officer candidates attend a &quot;Primary Officer Candidates Course&quot; for a year, and then enroll into &quot;Officer Candidates Course&quot; 

Approximately 60 cadets and 30 officer candidates are accepted by JCGA every year. The total population of the JCGA is about 220, of which 11% are female as of 2020.

The National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education, an Independent Administrative Institution affiliated with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has recognised the courses and awards the graduates of the academy degrees (Bachelor of Science in Coast Guard Operations and law Enforcement to JCGA graduates uniquely) on request. As the Academy is not an MEXT-recognised university, it cannot offer its own degrees.

==Academics==

Cadets study basic education subjects including English, maritime law, physics, and political science in the first and second years, and begin taking specialized subjects in navigation, engine, and information and communications majors in the second half of the second year. Courses in subjects such as bridge resource management, business management, information science, international law, leadership, meteorology, oceanography, and languages such as Chinese, Korean, and Russian are offered as electives. Upon graduation or completion of training, both cadets and officer candidates will be commissioned as Coast Guard Officer 3rd Grade. Several domestic voyages are required for graduation or completion, before around the world international voyages and a 3 month deployment following completion of studies aboard the training ship JCG Kojima (PL-21) (replaced by JCG Itsukushima (PL-23) in 2024). In 2011, courses in international business were added to improve language skills and the cadets&#x27; ability to respond to international incidents.

The JCGA participates in exchanges with foreign coast guard organizations such as the United States Coast Guard Academy, Canadian Coast Guard College, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, and the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and other counterparts.

In response to increased Grey-zone challenges affecting many of Japan&#x27;s Indo-Pacific neighbors, JCGA introduced the Maritime Safety and Security Policy Program in 2015, a master’s degree program for junior coast guard officers from Japan and other Asian coast guard agencies in international law, international relations, maritime police policy, and other relevant subjects through the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. Along with international students from other Indo-Pacific countries, students learn how to deal with various issues that arise at sea, and have the opportunity to acquire professional knowledge and analytical skills.

==Campus==
The JCGA is located in the Wakaba-cho neighborhood of Kure, Hiroshima, on land previously belonging to the Kure Naval Arsenal. The present campus was opened in 1952 after JCGA&#x27;s founding a year earlier in Tokyo to provide officers for the newly established Maritime Safety Agency following the dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Navy by Allied forces.

About 8,000 books from the former Imperial Japanese Naval War College, have been preserved at the JCGA library including tactical books from the early 19th century, diplomatic documents from the time of World War I, and books previously owned by Admiral Heihachiro Togo.

The Japan Coast Guard Museum is also located on the JCGA campus, containing approximately 1,000 items, such as photographs of historic patrol boats, ship models, and artifacts from the Battle of Amami-Oshima (2001).

==In popular culture==
JCGA has been featured in several Japanese film and television shows including Keisuke Kinoshita&#x27;s Big Joys, Small Sorrows (1986), and the Umizaru franchise, based on the popular manga by Shuho Sato.

<doc id="771323" wikidata="Q2156517" url="?curid=771323" title="Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem">
<text>Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, or simply The Electric Mayhem, are an American Muppet rock group that debuted in 1975 on the pilot for the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. They are the house band for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, with personalities and appearances inspired by prominent real-life rock music and jazz performers. They subsequently appeared in various Muppet films and television specials and have also recorded album tracks and covered numerous songs. The Electric Mayhem consists of Dr. Teeth on vocals and keyboards, Animal on drums, Floyd Pepper on vocals and bass, Janice on vocals and lead guitar, Zoot on saxophone, and Lips on trumpet. The band&#x27;s members were originally performed by Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, Dave Goelz, and Steve Whitmire, respectively; they are presently performed by Bill Barretta, Eric Jacobson, Matt Vogel, David Rudman, Goelz, and Peter Linz, respectively.

The group made their debut in 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;, the pilot for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Dr. Teeth and Animal were designed by Henson, Zoot was designed by Bonnie Erickson, while the rest of the original band members were designed by Michael K. Frith. Animal, Floyd and Zoot also played in the Muppet Show pit band, performing the opening and closing themes and underscoring most of the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; performances. Lips and occasionally Janice appeared in the orchestra in later episodes. Lips joined the band as the sixth member in the fifth season of the series, and made some appearances with the group after &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; ended production; the group later reverted to its original five member line-up, until Lips returned in 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first film role was performing the song &quot;Can You Picture That?&quot; in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;. They also performed &quot;Night Life&quot; and participated in &quot;The Happiness Hotel&quot; in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; and performed &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;. They appeared in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (sans Lips) where Dr. Teeth sang &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take No For An Answer&quot;. Following the deaths of two of the group&#x27;s puppeteers, Henson and Hunt, they were limited to brief instrumental background music throughout the 1990s. However, the Electric Mayhem backed Miss Piggy for a song in &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; and performed alongside Miley Cyrus in the 2008 &quot;Studio DC: Almost Live&quot; television special. They have been a mainstay in the Muppets&#x27; viral video efforts of the 2010s and have a featured role in 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets&quot; as the house band on the show-within-a-show &quot;Up Late with Miss Piggy&quot;. The same year, they released two music videos for &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; (featuring Sam Eagle) and &quot;Kodachrome&quot;.

An Electric Mayhem &quot;live&quot; tour with audio-animatronic versions of the puppets and rock band My Morning Jacket performing the characters was proposed by The Walt Disney Company but ultimately abandoned. The band performed a live five-song set at the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival on August 6, 2016. 

&quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, a series about the Electric Mayhem recording their first eponymous studio album, premiered on Disney+ on May 10, 2023.

==Members==

Despite featuring Dr. Teeth&#x27;s name prominently in the band&#x27;s name, the group officially has no frontman and instead has described itself as a &quot;rocktocracy&quot;. The original pilot episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; also featured Jim, a Muppet caricature of Henson on banjo.

=== Dr. Teeth ===
* Performed by Jim Henson (1975–1990), John Kennedy (1991–2003), Bill Barretta (2005–present)
Dr. Gerald Teeth Jr. is the gravelly-voiced lead singer and keyboardist. He is green-skinned and red-haired with a large grinning mouth of teeth including a gold tooth supposedly fashioned by melting down his gold records. He sports a scruffy red beard with no mustache, a fur vest, a striped shirt and a floppy purple top hat. He has arms so long that additional puppeteers are required to guide them; this design enabled Henson to work the Dr. Teeth puppet while another performer acted as Dr. Teeth&#x27;s hands in order to play the keyboard. His self-introduction in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was typically grandiose: &quot;Golden teeth and golden tones. &quot;Welcome&quot; to my presence.&quot; He often misuses long words and mangles verb conjugation. Jim Henson originally performed him, basing the character on New Orleans musician Dr. John. He was designed by Henson and Michael K. Frith and built by Don Sahlin. He debuted in &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;.
Dr. Teeth only sings lead vocals on the second Muppet pilot and during the first season and these songs were only written before Rowlf the Dog had become firmly established as the regular Muppet pianist. Later performances mostly feature lead vocals by Floyd or Janice and only a few featured Dr. Teeth. His speaking roles got even smaller after his performer Jim Henson&#x27;s death; an exception was the 1991 Muppets stage show &quot;Muppets on Location: Days of Swine and Roses&quot;, the voice being performed by John Kennedy. He performed Dr. Teeth from 1991 to 2003 but made only very brief appearances with very little dialogue, some examples being the 1999 film &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; and once in the music video for the &quot;We Are Family&quot; charity song in 2002. Bill Barretta took over the role beginning with &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;. Dr. Teeth&#x27;s first major speaking role since Henson&#x27;s death was in Statler and Waldorf&#x27;s very own show, &quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot; where Victor Yerrid performed him. Barretta, however, has been performing Dr. Teeth consistently since 2005.

Although being the band leader, Dr. Teeth is never featured in the regular orchestra playing at &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; like the rest of the group. Instead, Rowlf plays the piano in the orchestra pit.

Jim Henson once said that Dr. Teeth was one of the most difficult characters to play due to the harshness of the character&#x27;s voice. Although he appeared in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, he was absent from &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; and did not appear in the first episode.

In the 2023 series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, Dr. Teeth is revealed to be an actual doctor, having worked in his family&#x27;s dentistry business before leaving with Floyd to start the band. After an argument with the band, he rechristens the band&#x27;s name simply as &quot;The Electric Mayhem&quot; out of parity for the other members.

=== Animal ===
* Performed by Frank Oz (1975–2000), John Kennedy (2001–2003), Eric Jacobson (2002–present)

Animal is the primitive wildman, drummer and the most published member of the band, being the only member to appear in every feature film and the only member in the regular cast of the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; spin-off cartoon. He is named for his wild behavior and drumming. Some speculate the character is based on either Keith Moon, John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Mike Baird, or Levon Helm, while others have suggested Mick Fleetwood. Original performer Frank Oz has stated that Animal&#x27;s character can be summed up in five words: sex, sleep, food, drums, and pain. Several years ago, the famed Ludwig Drum Company built a specially modified version of their child-sized Ludwig Jr. kit for Animal, as noted on their website at the time. In the April 8, 2002, episode of &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Billy Joel claimed that Liberty DeVitto was the inspiration for the Muppets character Animal. This assertion has not been taken seriously as Animal&#x27;s initial appearance in the 1974 pilot for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; occurred two full years before DeVitto even made his first recording (on Joel&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Turnstiles&quot;). Others say there is no evidence that Animal was based on anyone specifically, and is simply an amalgam of common stereotypes about rock drummers.

Oz performed Animal from his first appearance until 2000; he has been performed regularly by Eric Jacobson since his 2002 appearance in &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;. In &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, he was voiced by Howie Mandel (1984–1985) and by Dave Coulier (1986–1991). Animal was also played by Kevin Clash in &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; and by Bill Barretta in &quot;MuppetFest&quot; (the first Muppet fan convention). Animal&#x27;s drumming was performed by British jazz and big band drummer Ronnie Verrell. He has had numerous appearances on television in advertising and on a U.S. postage stamp.

The 2023 series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, it is revealed that Animal was raised by Floyd after being abandoned on his doorstep as a baby.

=== Floyd Pepper ===
* Performed by Jerry Nelson (1975–2003; 2008), John Kennedy (2005–2006), Matt Vogel (2008–present)
Sgt. Floyd Pepper is the bassist and backup singer. A laid back hippie with a pink body and long orange hair, he usually wore a green army cap or sometimes while in the pit, a slightly fancier cap of stiffer, glittery material and a red uniform with epaulets and ornate gold braid on the buttons. He plays his bass left-handed; and although he&#x27;s been seen playing a variety of bass guitars over time, he appears to have settled for playing Fender basses. The character was originated by Jerry Nelson until 2003. At this time, Nelson retired from performing most of his characters, citing health reasons and John Kennedy took over the role beginning with &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;. Matt Vogel took over in &quot;A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa&quot; and is Floyd&#x27;s current performer. Author Christopher Finch says that Floyd is most like Nelson and if there were a spin-off of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; centering on his band, Floyd would probably emerge as the central figure. He was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Dave Goelz. He debuted in &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;.

A battle of the egos occurs whenever he and Miss Piggy are on screen together as he loves to poke fun at her airs and graces. He&#x27;s also somewhat arrogant, referring to himself in a &quot;Muppet Magazine&quot; article as one real cool dude and during &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (season 1 episode 23) he says to Kermit the Frog: &quot;Kermit, you are talking to Floyd Pepper! The hippest of the hip! I mean I have a room for life at the home of the chronically groovy!&quot;. His name and pink color are homages to the band Pink Floyd, and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, the album by the Beatles. He appears backstage more often than the other band members.

Although Dr. Teeth is the leader, Floyd is the one who sings lead most often. Some of the songs he sang on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; include: &quot;New York State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;. He has a close relationship with Janice and is Animal&#x27;s close friend and handler. In books like &quot;The Case of The Missing Mother&quot;, by James Howe, Animal is practically Floyd&#x27;s pet. In &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, it is revealed that Floyd raised Animal from a young age, and inspired a young Dr. Teeth to become a musician.

Floyd has declared himself to be an excellent songwriter—when the band briefly went on strike, one of his conditions was that he be allowed to write new theme music for the show—but with no apparent contradiction, admits that everyone hates his music. &quot;If I didn&#x27;t know I was a genius,&quot; he once declared, &quot;&quot;I&quot; wouldn&#x27;t listen to the trash I write.&quot; He nonetheless seems to have made a small fortune on advertising jingles during one of the band&#x27;s sabbatical.

It is believed he is based on the guitarist Jeff Baxter, who is a studio musician and a former member of both Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers.

=== Janice ===
* Performed by Fran Brill (1975–1976), John Lovelady (1975) Eren Ozker (1976), Richard Hunt (1975, 1977–1992), Matt Vogel (2000), Kevin Clash (2001), Brian Henson (2002–2003), Tyler Bunch (2005–2008), David Rudman (2008–present)
Janice is a guitarist and backup singer with a flower child personality. She has blonde hair, big eyelashes and lips, and usually wears a brown hat with a turquoise gem and a feather. Though she regularly performed vocals, she actually only sang lead a couple of times on the show. She also acted in sketches periodically, most notably as wisecracking Nurse Janice in &#x27;Veterinarian&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;, a recurring parody of medical dramas; in the latter role, she dispenses with much of her flower child lingo. Her name is an homage to Janis Joplin, and she bears a resemblance to Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary. Janice is the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and backup singer and she plays left-handed. Her favourite guitar is a Gibson Les Paul with cherry sunburst colour scheme.

Janice was involved with Zoot in the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; but paired up with Floyd Pepper at the start of season two. Janice was performed by Eren Ozker during the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (without the valley-girl voice), then she was performed by Richard Hunt until his death in 1992. Briefly, in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; pilot, in the Muppet Meeting Films and in one Season 1 sketch she was performed by Fran Brill. Due to the lack of female Muppet performers, Janice has, since Ozker&#x27;s departure, consistently been played by a man.

Muppet characters are frequently paired together based on how well puppeteers perform as a team. Richard Hunt and Jerry Nelson had established themselves as a team prior to &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Therefore, the change in Janice&#x27;s performer may have been the reason for her relationship shifting from Zoot to Floyd. After Hunt&#x27;s death, her character was faded back to brief non-speaking background appearances until 2000&#x27;s &quot;Muppet Race Mania&quot; in which she was performed by Matt Vogel. Brian Henson also provided her voice for &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; and the video game &quot;Muppets Party Cruise&quot;. In &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, she was performed by Tyler Bunch. Her most recent performer is David Rudman, who first performed her in &quot;Studio DC: Almost Live&quot;. John Lovelady performed her for one appearance in 1975.

A running gag in some Muppet movies was that during a scene in which several characters were excitedly talking at once and someone called for silence, Janice would be the last one still talking on a topic with no apparent connection to the situation. In &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;: &quot;So I told him &#x27;Look, buddy, I don&#x27;t take my clothes off for anybody, even if it is artistic,&#x27; and... Oh&quot;. Another example from &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, she says: &quot;Look, Mother. It&#x27;s my life. OK. So if I want to live on a beach and walk around naked... Oh&quot;.

Janice is the only member of the band apart from Animal to have appeared on the animated series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. In her single appearance, she was portrayed as slightly older than the main characters and able to read. She was voiced by Dave Coulier who regularly voiced baby versions of Animal, Bunsen Honeydew and Bean Bunny.

In the 2023 series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, Janice is revealed to have an estranged twin sister.

=== Zoot ===
* Performed by Dave Goelz (1975–present)
Zoot is a teal-colored, balding saxophone player with dark glasses and a high-crowned blue felt hat that is generally a laid-back fellow of few words. His name refers to the 20th-century saxophonist Zoot Sims and per designer Bonnie Erickson is modeled after Latin jazz artist Gato Barbieri. He is performed by Dave Goelz. He was conceived as a burned-out, depressed 50-year-old musician but according to Goelz when the role was assigned to him, he did not know how to perform that type of character. He, therefore, made the character mainly communicate through his playing rather than by speaking.

Zoot spoke much more in the first season where he was often seen dancing with Janice in the &quot;At the Dance&quot; sketches. Goelz stated that he tried to give most of Zoot&#x27;s lines away to other characters, particularly Floyd. Floyd&#x27;s performer Jerry Nelson was not performing full-time in the first season which may explain Zoot originally having more dialogue. Since his eyes are hidden by his shades, he often appears oblivious to events around him—during the band&#x27;s first meeting with Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear as depicted in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, he briefly forgot his own name which Floyd described as Zoot &quot;skip[ping] the groove again&quot;—but he can be sharper than he seems. When Floyd declared the band to be &quot;anklin&#x27;&quot; during its brief strike, only Zoot seemed dubious, noting &quot;The frog&#x27;s been good to us.&quot;

Zoot&#x27;s claim to fame was playing the final off-key note to the end theme of the show; he then looks into his saxophone with a bewildered expression, checks his music, gives a satisfied nod, looks around at the other musicians and gives the same nod. The note played is the lowest note on the baritone saxophone, while most of Zoot&#x27;s other playing has the sound of a tenor saxophone and his instrument appears to be an alto saxophone.

In &quot;A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that he celebrates Hanukkah.

=== Lips ===
* Performed by Steve Whitmire (1980–2016), Peter Linz (2017–present)
Lips is the band&#x27;s mumbling, yellow-haired trumpet player who joined the Electric Mayhem during the final season of &quot;The Muppet Show.&quot; His name is inspired by the imagery of lips seen on posters for &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, one of Whitmire&#x27;s favorite films. He has yellow frizzy hair that has been compared to a chrysanthemum (much to his chagrin), a goatee, and a permanent squint. His appearances on the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; were few and far between and when he did appear in the later episodes or movies, he rarely did anything besides play the trumpet. One of his few speaking appearances was in the Shirley Bassey episode where he sang a line of &quot;Barnyard Boogie.&quot;

He was mainly created so that Whitmire could have a character to perform in the band. His lack of character development was apparently due to Whitmire&#x27;s uncertainty about performing Lips. He was less experienced as a puppeteer at the time and wanted to use a voice like Louis Armstrong but was afraid of offending African Americans. After &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, he was not seen at all until the 2009 NBC special &quot;Christmas in Rockefeller Center&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011). He also appeared and spoke (albeit very briefly) in the 2014 movie &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;. He appears (and speaks on several occasions) in the 2015 series &quot;The Muppets&quot; having been completely rebuilt, as the original puppet from his &quot;Muppet Show&quot; days disintegrated on set during the filming of the 2015 music video &quot;Kodachrome&quot;. Lips speaks frequently in &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot; (2023), with his dialogue mainly consisting of unintelligible mumbling and occasionally a determinable sentence.

A recurring gag in &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot; and media released around the same time is that Lips has inexplicable connections to a myriad of celebrities and other people the Mayhem come across. This colorful history includes, but is not limited to, being a nursery school teacher, inspiring The Bangles song &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot;, and introducing Paula Abdul to MC Skat Kat.

===Songs===
==In popular culture==
* In &quot;&quot; (2004), after a confrontation with some Muppet-style aliens, Crichton makes a comment about &quot;being shot at by the Electric Mayhem&quot;.
* In an episode of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (&quot;Plastic Buffet&quot;), Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem are featured in a fake VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; sketch detailing the band&#x27;s activities after &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. It shows Dr. Teeth earning a living as a piano teacher and claims that no one has seen Zoot since he was arrested in Japan for possessing a suitcase filled with thirty-seven pounds of hash, which is a parody of the 1980 Paul McCartney marijuana bust. Also, in a fake episode of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Janice reveals that Tommy Lee gave her Hepatitis C and that she only has 5 years to live (referencing similar claims made by actress Pamela Anderson); when Stern ignores her distress and asks if Janice will show him her breasts, she angrily refuses. Finally, a possible comeback for the Electric Mayhem—a performance on &quot;Star Search&quot;—ends in tragedy when Animal has to be put down for viciously attacking host Ed McMahon. The sketch ends with Floyd sadly stating that a reunion of the Electric Mayhem is impossible without Animal and Zoot as Dr. Teeth plays a piano duet with Rowlf the Dog and a sickly Janice coughs in the background.
* The &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Herpe the Love Sore&quot; begins with Peter and Lois watching an episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot; about the Electric Mayhem.

<text>WinCo Foods, Inc. is a privately held, majority employee-owned American supermarket chain based in Boise, Idaho, with retail stores in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. It was founded in 1967 as a no-frills warehouse-style store with low prices. The stores feature extensive bulk food sections.

Until 1998, it operated as Waremart and Cub Foods, the latter under a franchise agreement. However, WinCo began re-establishing Waremart Foods in 2017. , WinCo has 138 retail stores and six distribution centers, with over 20,000 employees. As of May 2022, WinCo Foods was No. 46 in Forbes.com&#x27;s list of the largest privately owned companies in the United States.

==Overview==
WinCo Foods is based in Boise, Idaho. It was founded in 1967, and the company is mostly owned by current and former employees through an employee stock ownership plan. WinCo operates distribution centers in the following locations:
* Woodburn, Oregon 
* Myrtle Creek, Oregon 
* Boise, Idaho 
* Phoenix, Arizona 
* Denton, Texas 
* Modesto, California

The company reduces operating expenses by purchasing directly from manufacturers and farmers, operating basic no-frills stores, and not providing a bagging service. In addition, the company does not accept credit cards for payment due to transaction fees (debit and WIC/EBT cards are accepted).

==History==

The company, originally called Waremart, was founded in Boise, Idaho, in 1967 by Ralph Ward and Bud Williams as a no-frills, warehouse-style grocery store focusing on low prices. In 1985, Waremart employees established an employee stock ownership plan and purchased a majority stake of Waremart from the Ward family, making the company employee-owned.

In January 1991, Waremart opened an store in Boise to replace the two older Boise stores. At the time, Waremart was operating 16 stores in the Northwest and had reported annual sales of more than $300 million.

=== WinCo Foods ===

In October 1998, Waremart changed its name to WinCo Foods, citing confusion with retailers Kmart and Walmart as reason for the new name. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;winning company&quot;. Nonetheless, three Oregon stores — those in Independence, Keizer, and Ontario — are branded as &quot;Waremart by WinCo&quot;.

The idea that the company name is an acronym consisting of the first letters of the company&#x27;s original five states of operation (Washington, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Oregon) is false. Michael Read, WinCo&#x27;s VP of Public and Legal Affairs, called the theory &quot;part of the folklore&quot;.

In 2007, WinCo Foods accused a competing chain, Save Mart, of directing a lawsuit filed by a neighborhood group &quot;Tracy First&quot; of Tracy, California, to oppose city approval of a WinCo store. That same year, WinCo Foods opened in Pittsburg, California.

In early 2009, WinCo opened its first two stores in the Spokane, Washington, area. In October, 2009, WinCo expanded to Utah, adding two stores in West Valley City and Midvale. An additional Utah store opened in Roy on June 28, 2010. bringing the total number of stores expanded to Utah to five. WinCo previously operated stores in Utah under the Waremart banner prior to the company&#x27;s name change.

In January 2011, WinCo began signing leases for an expansion to Southern Nevada and Arizona. The chain opened stores in Las Vegas and Henderson, Nevada, on March 4, 2012. The company&#x27;s first two stores in Arizona opened on April 1, 2012, in the Phoenix area. The company opened multiple locations in Texas, primarily in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, beginning in 2014 after it completed a distribution center in the area.

WinCo was named as the sponsor for the WinCo Foods Portland Open in June 2013.

In late 2014, WinCo announced that it would enter the Oklahoma City metro market, starting with stores in Moore and Midwest City, with plans to open two other locations.

In May 2018, Grant Haag was made president and CEO of WinCo Foods.

WinCo was sued in 2023 for the use of excessive force on multiple occasions in the handling of shoplifters. WinCo also faced significant criticism in the treatment of a teenage girl accused of shoplifting at their Vancouver, Washington, store in 2017.

WinCo paid a class action settlement of $3.6 million in 2023. It was alleged that WinCo stores in Portland, Oregon, charged a hidden clean energy surcharge on non-grocery items.

In October 2024, engineering firm JSA Civil filed a proposal for the first WinCo Foods location in Seattle.

<doc id="771326" wikidata="Q2576499" url="?curid=771326" title="Nutritionist">
<text>A nutritionist is a person who advises others on matters of food and nutrition and their impacts on health. Some people specialize in particular areas, such as sports nutrition, public health, or animal nutrition, among other disciplines. In many countries, a person can claim to be a nutritionist even without any training, education, or professional license, in contrast to a dietitian, who has a university degree, professional license, and certification for professional practice.

==Regulation of the title &quot;nutritionist&quot;==
The professional practice of being a &quot;dietitian&quot; (also spelled &quot;dietician&quot; in the US) is different from a &quot;nutritionist&quot;. In many countries and jurisdictions, the title &quot;nutritionist&quot; is not subject to statutory professional regulation; thus, any person may self-title as a nutritionist or nutrition expert, even if self-taught and professionally uncertified. In the United Kingdom, Australia, parts of Canada, and most US states, a person self-titled as a &quot;nutritionist&quot; is not legally defined, whereas a &quot;dietitian&quot; is professionally certified and registered. People who have current registration with the appropriate regulatory body usually refer to themselves as &quot;Registered dietitians&quot;, and so may use the professional designation, &quot;RD&quot; or &quot;SRD&quot;.

The term nutritionist may refer to a range of trained or untrained individuals – from someone who has no qualifications in nutrition to someone with a PhD in nutrition science. Within the professional field of nutrition, there is also the field of &quot;nutrition therapy&quot; which may be associated with practitioners of alternative medicine. Prominent examples include Gillian McKeith, Patrick Holford and Robert O. Young. A potential problem with self-proclaimed and media nutritionists, is low levels of training, the selling of supplements and herbal remedies and the use or promotion of concepts that are untested or potentially even dangerous, such as exclusion of food groups, detox and fad diets.

===Brazil===
To obtain the Nutritionist title, one must have studied at a recognized university for four years plus a year practice (internship). The nutritionists are registered at the &quot;Conselho Regional de Nutrição&quot; (Regional Council of Nutrition). A Nutritionist can prescribe diets, work at hospitals with clinical intervention, or in the food production segment.

===Canada===
There is variation across the country with different provinces having different regulations. The title &quot;nutritionist&quot; is protected by provincial law in Quebec and Nova Scotia. The term &quot;Registered Nutritionist&quot; or &quot;Nutritionist&quot; is protected in Alberta. The term “Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist” is protected by law in New Brunswick.

For example, the Nova Scotia Dietetic Association is the regulatory body for professional dietitians and nutritionists in that province, authorized by legislation, the Professional Dietitians Act, &quot;to engage in registration, quality assurance, and when necessary, the discipline of dietitians in Nova Scotia to ensure safe, ethical and competent dietetic practice.&quot; Professional requirements include a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Dietetics/Nutrition from an accredited university, a program of practical training, and successful completion of a registration examination (the &quot;Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination&quot; or CDRE).

===Hong Kong===
Qualified Nutritionist; Any person who is the holder of a degree (baccalaureate, master, doctoral) in dietetics, foods, and nutrition awarded by a university or other institution recognised by the Association. Qualified Dietitian: Any person who is currently holder of a degree or a postgraduate diploma in dietetics recognized by the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Dietitian Board), the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, British Dietetic Association and Dietitians Australia, for full membership or equivalent. Details can be found in the Hong Kong Nutrition Association. Job opportunities available in the Hospitals (Government or Private), private consultation companies. In Hong Kong, more and more people are taking note of the importance of balanced diets. The Government, Heart Foundation, Elderly Associations, etc., are keenly promoting in collaboration with local companies like WeCare Nutritionist and Consultants, Nestle, Anlene, etc., resulting in the urgent needs of nutritional professionals.

===Morocco===
In Morocco, &quot;Nutritionist&quot; is a protected title and might refer to a researcher in the field of nutrition or to a person who practices therapeutic nutrition. To hold the title of Nutritionist, a person should have carried doctoral studies in the field of nutrition and obtained a Ph.D. degree. On the other hand, the title of &quot;Dietitian&quot; is given to whoever carries studies in nutrition schools for three years and obtains a B.Sc. However, unlike Nutritionists, Dietitians are not given authorization to open private offices and to practice.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, nutritionists must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa. The Council regulates the professional titles of &quot;Nutritionist&quot;, &quot;Student Nutritionist&quot;, and &quot;Supplementary Nutritionist&quot;, along with &quot;Dietitian&quot;, &quot;Student Dietitian&quot;, and Supplementary Dietitian&quot;. Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognized bachelor&#x27;s degree from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management.

===United Kingdom===
&quot;Nutritionist&quot; is not a protected term in the UK, unlike &quot;dietitian&quot;; the latter must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. The Association for Nutrition is a registered charity that holds the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN) and is recognised by Public Health England, NHS Careers as the regulator of Registered Nutritionists in the UK, with individuals requiring a minimum of an Honours Degree in nutrition science alongside a commitment to a set of standards for ethics, conduct and performance to become allowed entry to the UKVRN and conferred the title Registered Associate Nutritionist (ANutr) or Registered Nutritionist (RNutr).

Since 2002, the number of jobs for nutritionists has reportedly grown faster in the National Health Service (NHS) than in any other sector. The NHS states that &quot;Dietitians and nutritionists have different roles and training and are regulated by different bodies.&quot; The growth of the nutritionist career could be due to an increasing focus on disease prevention, which is firmly within the remit and expertise of public health nutritionists, rather than just a focus on disease treatment and the clinical domain of dietitians. 

===United States===

Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS) are professionals who have an advanced degree in nutrition from a fully accredited institution. There are three distinct certification pathways, which include the CNS for Nutrition and Health Professionals (CNS), CNS for MDs and DOs (CNS), and CNS for Scholars (CNS-S). To be awarded the CNS credential, candidates must complete 1,000 supervised practice hours. They must also pass an examination that covers a spectrum of nutritional science and applied clinical topics. CNS practitioners commonly work in private and integrative health practices.

Registered dietitian nutritionists (RD; RDN) are health professionals qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Government regulation, especially in terms of licensing, is currently more universal for the RD or RDN than that of CCN.

Certified Clinical Nutritionists (CCN) are trained health professionals who offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. Quackwatch has accused the group that provides credentialing to CCNs, and its members, of promoting highly dubious medical claims including homeopathy, detoxification, and herbalism.

<doc id="771327" wikidata="Q1185862" url="?curid=771327" title="Kokuji">
<text>In Japanese, or are kanji created in Japan rather than borrowed from China. Like most Chinese characters, they are primarily formed by combining existing characters - though using combinations that are not used in Chinese. 

Since kokuji are generally devised for existing native words, they usually only have native &quot;kun&quot; readings. However, they occasionally also have a Chinese &quot;on&quot; reading derived from a related kanji, such as (&quot;dō&quot;, &#x27;work&#x27;), which takes its &quot;on&quot; pronunciation from (&quot;dō&quot;, &#x27;move&#x27;). In rare cases, a kokuji may only have an &quot;on&quot; reading, such as (&quot;sen&quot;, &#x27;gland&#x27;), which was derived from (&quot;sen&quot;, &#x27;spring, fountain&#x27;) for use in medical terminology.

The majority of kokuji are semantic compounds, meaning that they are composed of two (or more) characters with relevant meanings. For example, (&#x27;work&#x27;) is composed of (&#x27;person&#x27; radical) plus (&#x27;move&#x27;). This is in contrast to Chinese kanji, which are overwhelmingly phono-semantic compounds. This is because the phonetic element of phono-semantic kanji is always based on the &quot;on&quot; reading, which most kokuji don&#x27;t have, leaving semantic compounding as the only alternative. Other examples include &#x27;sakaki tree&#x27;, formed from &#x27;tree&#x27; and &#x27;deity&#x27; (literally &#x27;divine tree&#x27;), and &#x27;crossroads&#x27; formed from &#x27;road&#x27; and &#x27;cross&#x27;.

Kokuji are especially common for describing species of flora and fauna including a very large number of fish such as (sardine), (codfish), (seaperch), and (sillago), and trees such as (evergreen oak), (Japanese cedar), (birch, maple) and (spindle tree).

== Term ==

The term &quot;kokuji&quot; in Japanese can refer to any character created outside of China, including Korean &quot;gukja&quot; () and Vietnamese &quot;chữ Nôm&quot;. &quot;Wasei kanji&quot; refers specifically to kanji invented in Japan.

== History ==
Historically, some kokuji date back to very early Japanese writing, being found in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, for example— &quot;iwashi&quot; &quot;sardine&quot; dates to the Nara period (8th century)—while they have continued to be created as late as the late 19th century, when a number of characters were coined in the Meiji era for new scientific concepts. For example, some characters were produced as regular compounds for some (but not all) SI units, such as ( &quot;meter&quot; + &quot;thousand, kilo-&quot;) for kilometer, ( &quot;liter&quot; + &quot;thousand, kilo-&quot;) for kiloliter, and ( &quot;gram&quot; + &quot;thousand, kilo-&quot;) for kilogram. However, SI units in Japanese today are almost exclusively written using rōmaji or katakana such as or for km, for kl, and or for kg.

In Japan, the kokuji category is strictly defined as characters whose &quot;earliest&quot; appearance is in Japan. If a character appears earlier in the Chinese literature, it is not considered a kokuji even if the character was independently coined in Japan and unrelated to the Chinese character (meaning &quot;not borrowed from Chinese&quot;). In other words, kokuji are not simply characters that were made in Japan, but characters that were &quot;first&quot; made in Japan. An illustrative example is . This spelling was created in Edo period Japan from the ateji (phonetic kanji spelling) for the existing word &quot;ankō&quot; by adding the radical to each character—the characters were &quot;made in Japan&quot;. However, is not considered kokuji, as it is found in ancient Chinese texts as a corruption of (魚匽). is considered kokuji, as it has not been found in any earlier Chinese text. Casual listings may be more inclusive, including characters such as . Another example is , which is sometimes not considered kokuji due to its earlier presence as a corruption of Chinese .

== Examples ==
There are hundreds of &quot;kokuji&quot; in existence. Many are rarely used, but a number have become commonly used components of the written Japanese language. These include the following:

Jōyō kanji has about nine kokuji; there is some dispute over classification, but the following are generally included: 
* &quot;dō&quot;, &quot;hatara(ku)&quot; &quot;work&quot;, the most commonly used kokuji, used in the fundamental verb , included in elementary texts and on the JLPT N5.
* &quot;ko(mu)&quot;, used in the fundamental verb 
* &quot;nio(u)&quot;, used in common verb 
* &quot;hatake&quot; &quot;field of crops&quot;
* &quot;sen&quot;, &quot;gland&quot;
* &quot;tōge&quot; &quot;mountain pass&quot;
* &quot;waku&quot;, &quot;frame&quot;
* &quot;hei&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;
* &quot;shibo(ru)&quot;, &quot;to squeeze&quot; (disputed; see above); 
Jinmeiyō kanji:
* &quot;sakaki&quot; &quot;tree, genus &quot;Cleyera&quot;&quot;
* &quot;tsuji&quot; &quot;crossroads, street&quot;
* &quot;monme&quot; (unit of weight)
Hyōgaiji kanji:
* &quot;shitsuke&quot; &quot;training, rearing (an animal, a child)&quot;

Some of these characters (for example, , &quot;gland&quot;) have been introduced to China; additionally, Standard Mandarin readings are assigned to some kokuji used in Japanese toponymy, for example by the Guobiao standard GB/T 17693.10. In some cases, the Chinese reading is the inferred Chinese reading, interpreting the character as a phono-semantic compound (as in how &quot;on&quot; readings are sometimes assigned to these characters in Chinese), while, in other cases (such as ), the Japanese &quot;on&quot; reading is borrowed (in general this differs from the modern Chinese pronunciation of this phonetic). Similar coinages occurred to a more limited extent in Korea and Vietnam.

<text>, known professionally as , was a Japanese voice actress from Fukushima Prefecture. At the time of her death, she was affiliated with 81 Produce. She was best known for voicing Sailor Jupiter in the first anime adaptation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, Kaho Mizuki in &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and its sequel &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card&quot;, and Kushina Uzumaki in &quot;&quot;. She was married to tokusatsu actor Hiroshi Watari.

==Biography==
Shinohara was born in Fukushima Prefecture on August 8, 1963, and raised in Ueda, Nagano. She joined the drama and choir clubs during her later years in elementary school. Since junior high school, she had always wanted to become an actor, and after graduating from Ueda High School, she thought that &quot;singing can also be a way to study acting&quot;, and she was subsequently educated at the Kunitachi College of Music Department of Music Education. While at the college, she joined an off-campus club and performed in musicals.

While aiming to become an actress, she joined a study group called Voice Arts, and she took part in an audition at the invitation of sound director Yasunori Honda, who was a teacher of hers at Voice Arts, and passed, and she was cast as B-ko Daitokuji in the 1986 film &quot;Project A-ko&quot;. Subsequently, she joined Arts Vision and then 81 Produce.

In 1992, Shinohara began starring as Sailor Jupiter, one of the major characters in the first anime adaptation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. According to Megan Peters of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, Shinohara&#x27;s &quot;work on Sailor Moon helped kickstart one of anime&#x27;s most magical stories&quot; and she &quot;brought that headstrong performance to life with ease.&quot; In addition to Sailor Jupiter, she also voiced other background characters.

In addition to Sailor Jupiter, she also voiced Presea in &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, Kaho Mizuki in &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, Yayoi Matsunaga in &quot;&quot;, Charlotte Elbourne in &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot; (2000), Yōko Mizuno in &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;, Ophelia in &quot;Claymore&quot;, and Kushina Uzumaki in &quot;&quot;. She also voiced Agarte Lindblum in the video game &quot;Tales of Rebirth&quot; and Bakuryū Pteranodon in the tokusatsu series &quot;Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger&quot;. She would often voice &quot;older sister&quot; or &quot;mother&quot; characters in anime. In the last few years of her career, she reprised her role as Kaho in the 2018 sequel series &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card&quot;, and she voiced Sachiko in the 2020 film &quot;A Whisker Away&quot;.

She released three albums through Apollon (now : &quot;Windows&quot; (1994), &quot;Street&quot; (1994), and &quot;Ashita e&quot; (1996). In 1997, she released another album from Nippon Columbia, &quot;Missing Piece&quot;.

Her husband was tokusatsu actor Hiroshi Watari. She had an older brother. She also shared the same birth date as her &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; co-star Rika Fukami, and they even had a joint birthday concert together, performing as the duo Funky Twins on their 33rd birthday in 1996. She also worked at Senzoku Gakuen College of Music as a voice acting and &quot;anison&quot; teacher.

==Death==
Shinohara died on September 8, 2024, one month after her 61st birthday. Undergoing treatment for an unspecified illness at the time, she reportedly had recently been on a respirator and wheelchair and some of her bones had fractured. In addition to her husband, several other voice actors offered condolences, including her &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; co-stars Kotono Mitsuishi, Rika Fukami, Megumi Ogata, and her &quot;Naruto&quot; co-star Toshiyuki Morikawa. Additionally, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; creator Naoko Takeuchi and her husband, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; creator Yoshihiro Togashi both drew Sailor Jupiter as a tribute to Shinohara.
