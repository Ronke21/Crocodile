<text>Donald William Crisp (27 July 188225 May 1974) was an English film actor as well as an early producer, director and screenwriter. His career lasted from the early silent film era into the 1960s. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1942 for his performance in &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;.

==Early life==
Donald Crisp was born George William Crisp at 3 Clay Hall Road, Bow, London, on 27 July 1882. He was the youngest of ten children (four boys and six girls) born to Elizabeth (née Christy) and James Crisp, a labourer. He was educated locally and in 1901 was living with his parents and working as a driver of a horse-drawn vehicle.

Crisp made a number of claims about his early life that were eventually proven false decades after his death. He claimed that he was born in 1880 in Aberfeldy in Perthshire, Scotland, and even went so far as to maintain a Scottish accent throughout his life in Hollywood. In fact, he had no connections to Scotland, but in 1996, a plaque commemorating him was unveiled by Scottish comedian Jimmy Logan in Crisp&#x27;s supposed hometown of Aberfeldy. He claimed on alternative occasions that his father was a cattle farmer, a country doctor or a royal physician to King Edward VII. He also claimed that he was educated at Eton and Oxford, and that he served as a trooper in the 10th Hussars in the Boer War.

==Early career==

While travelling on the SS &quot;Carmania&quot; to the United States in July 1906, Crisp&#x27;s singing talents during a ship&#x27;s concert caught the attention of opera impresario John C. Fisher, who immediately offered him a job with his company. Crisp spent his first year in New York City in the Grand Opera, and the following year as a stage director. It was while touring with the company in the United States and Cuba that Crisp first became interested in the theatre. By 1910, Crisp, now using the name Donald (he retained George as a middle name), was working as a stage manager for the renowned entertainer, composer, playwright and director George M. Cohan. It was during this time he met and befriended film director D.W. Griffith. When Griffith ventured west, to seek his fortune in Hollywood in 1912, Crisp accompanied him. 

From 1908 to 1930, Crisp, in addition to directing dozens of films, also appeared in nearly 100 silent films, though many in bit or small parts. One notable exception was his casting by Griffith as General Ulysses S. Grant in Griffith&#x27;s landmark film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; in 1915. Another was his role in Griffith&#x27;s 1919 film &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; as &quot;Battling Burrows&quot;, the brutal and abusive father of the film&#x27;s heroine, Lucy Burrows (played by Lillian Gish; the actress was only 11 years his junior). 

==Director==
Crisp worked as an assistant to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was &quot;Little Country Mouse&quot;, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a dozen or more films in a single year at this time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably &quot;The Navigator&quot; (1924) with Buster Keaton and &quot;Don Q, Son of Zorro&quot; (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.

When asked later by an interviewer why he eventually gave up directing and returned full-time to acting, Crisp commented that directing had become extremely wearisome because he was so often called upon, if not forced, to do favours for studio chiefs by agreeing to employ their relatives in his films. His final directorial effort was the film &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; (1930).

==Military career==
Between working for Griffith and other producers, along with his many acting roles, Crisp managed to return to the U.K., serving in British army intelligence during the First World War (1914–1918). Crisp became an American citizen in 1930; during the Second World War (1939–1945), he served in the United States Army Reserve, attaining the rank of colonel.

==Return to acting==

With the advent of &quot;talkies&quot;, Crisp abandoned directing and devoted himself entirely to acting after 1930. He became a much sought after character actor. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, he appeared in a wide range of roles alongside some of the era&#x27;s biggest stars, including Katharine Hepburn in &quot;The Little Minister&quot; (1934) and &quot;A Woman Rebels&quot; (1936), Charles Laughton and Clark Gable in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935), Bette Davis and Henry Fonda in &quot;That Certain Woman&quot; (1937) and &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), Laurence Olivier in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), Errol Flynn in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939) and The Charge of the Light Brigade, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940) and Gregory Peck in &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945).

A versatile supporting actor, Crisp could be equally good in lovable or sinister roles. During the same period he was playing loving father figures or charming old codgers in classic films like &quot;National Velvet&quot; and &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;, he also turned in a well-received performance as Commander Beach, the tormented presumptive grandfather in Lewis Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944). Undoubtedly, however, Crisp&#x27;s most memorable role was as the taciturn but loving father in &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941) directed by John Ford. The film received ten Oscar nominations, winning five, including Best Picture, with Crisp winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1942.

==Hollywood power broker==
Crisp was an active and important liaison between the film industry and outside business interests. His extensive experience in business, the military and entertainment, including being a production and studio executive, lent itself well to this task. He became a highly valued adviser whose clear-headed forward thinking proved invaluable to the Bank of America, which was one of the leading sources of working capital for the film industry for many years (an industry whose life blood was loans). Crisp served on the bank&#x27;s advisory board for several decades, including a stint as its chairman. In this role, he had the ear of its board of directors, and many of the films eventually financed by the bank during the 1930s and 1940s got their most important approval from Crisp.

==Later years and legacy==
Crisp eventually became one of the more wealthy members of the film industry. His &quot;banker&#x27;s sobriety&quot;, extensive contacts and clarity of thought allowed him to make good investments, particularly in the real estate market. He continued to appear in films throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s. During more than half a century as an actor, he appeared in as many as 400 two-reel and feature-length productions, perhaps a great deal more. John Carradine, who counted over 500 films to his own credit (the Internet Movie Database records over 300), told his son Keith, who repeated the story during a 2018 Gilbert Gottfried podcast, that only Donald Crisp had appeared in more movies. Crisp&#x27;s final screen role was as Grandpa Spencer alongside former film co-stars Henry Fonda and Maureen O&#x27;Hara in the 1963 film &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot;. This film, adapted from the novel by Earl Hamner, Jr., was the basis for the 1970s television series &quot;The Waltons&quot;. 

Crisp was in his eighties by the time he quit acting entirely, continuing to work long after it was financially necessary simply because he enjoyed it. He was married three times. In 1912, he married actress Helen Pease, and they remained together until her death the following year. In 1917, he married Marie Stark, whom he divorced in 1920; she went on to act in silent films as Marie Crisp. In 1932, he married film screenwriter Jane Murfin, whom he divorced in 1944. He died in 1974, a few months short of his 92nd birthday, due to complications from a series of strokes. In addition to being one of the premier character actors of his era, he left behind an extensive list of contributions to the film industry he worked to promote for more than fifty years. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

He was a staunch Republican who campaigned for Thomas Dewey in 1944.

On February 8, 1960, Crisp received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry at 1628 Vine Street.

<doc id="774005" wikidata="Q251502" url="?curid=774005" title="Franz von Bayern">
<text>Franz Bonaventura Adalbert Maria Herzog von Bayern (born 14 July 1933), commonly known by the courtesy title Duke of Bavaria, is the head of the House of Wittelsbach, the former ruling family of the Kingdom of Bavaria. His great-grandfather King Ludwig III was the last ruling monarch of Bavaria, being deposed in 1918.

Franz was born in Munich. During the Second World War, the Wittelsbachs were anti-Nazi. The family initially left Nazi Germany for the Kingdom of Hungary but were eventually arrested following Operation Panzerfaust in 1944. Franz, who was only 11 at the time, spent time in several Nazi concentration camps, including Sachsenhausen, then Flossenbürg and finally Dachau.

After the war, Franz was a student at the University of Munich and became a collector of modern art. Franz succeeded as head of the House of Wittelsbach, and as pretender to the Bavarian throne, on the death of his father in 1996. He lives at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich and Berg Palace.

==Birth, exile, captivity, and education==
Franz was born on 14 July 1933 in Munich, as the third child and elder son of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, and his first wife, Countess Maria (Marita) Draskovich of Trakostjan, member of the House of Drašković, an old Croatian noble family. As Maria&#x27;s family didn&#x27;t belong to the small circle of reigning or former reigning families, his parents&#x27; marriage was initially considered morganatic. But, on 18 May 1949, when Franz was 15, his grandfather Crown Prince Rupprecht recognised the marriage of Franz&#x27;s parents as dynastic, and Franz became a successor to the headship of the house.

The Wittelsbach dynasty were opposed to the Nazi regime in Germany. The former Crown Prince Rupprecht earned Hitler&#x27;s enmity by opposing the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. In 1933, shortly after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, he sent his son Albrecht to President Paul von Hindenburg with a protest letter strongly objecting to the appointment of governors at the head of the federal states and thus the de facto abolition of German federalism. In July 1934, Prince Albrecht emigrated to Hungary with his family. From 1935 to 1939 the family returned to Bavaria and lived in seclusion in Kreuth, but former crown prince Rupprecht emigrated to Italy in 1939 and his son Albrecht and his family moved back to Budapest, where they stayed in a rented apartment in the Castle Quarter. They often visited Princess Marita&#x27;s Hungarian and Croatian relatives in the countryside. The children received private lessons after a visit to the German school failed after a few weeks because it was dominated by Nazi supporters.

In March 1944, Nazi Germany occupied Hungary, and on 6 October 1944 the entire family, including the 11-year-old Franz, were arrested by the Gestapo. They were sent to a series of Nazi concentration camps, including Oranienburg, Flossenbürg and Dachau. As special prisoners, they were allowed to stay together and were locked in separate buildings. Franz remembers that they only received one slice of bread, often moldy, per person per day as food. Badly hit by hunger and disease, the family barely survived. At the end of April 1945, they were liberated by the United States Third Army.

After the war, Franz received his secondary education at the Benedictine Abbey of Ettal. He then studied business management at the University of Munich and in Zürich. With his father and a sister, he took part in the ship tours organized by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica in 1954 and 1956, which became known as the &quot;Cruise of the Kings&quot; and were attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

==Patron of modern art==

Franz developed a passion for modern art and started to collect contemporary German art. He brought his own important art collection with early works by Joseph Beuys, Georg Baselitz and Blinky Palermo as well as numerous contemporary German painters such as Jörg Immendorff and Sigmar Polke on permanent loan to the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, which he had worked to found for decades, as well as to the Munich State Graphic Collection. He is chairman of the Association for the Promotion of the Alte Pinakothek, co-founder and deputy chairman of the Munich Gallery Association, member of the board of trustees of the Association of Friends and Supporters of the Glyptothek and the Bavarian state collections of antiquities and honorary president of the Friends of the Egyptian Collection Munich. In 2009, he left his extensive private library of 20th and 21st century art to the Central Institute for Art History in Munich.

Because of his good connections in the New York City art scene, his understanding of art, his international connections as well as his fate during the Nazi era, Franz von Bayern was the first German to be elected to the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art, where numerous Jewish emigrants set the tone. Only after him were other Germans elected to the advisory committee. He eventually became chairman of the International Council for 16 years and worked closely with the museum&#x27;s president, Blanchette Rockefeller, in expanding the collection in the 1980s. Despite his friendship with American artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Dan Flavin, he privately collected mostly contemporary German art: &quot;American art was always one step ahead of my financial possibilities.&quot;

In 2003, for his decades of support work, he was the first European to receive the &quot;Duncan Phillips Award&quot; from the Washington art museum Phillips Collection, which has been awarded to collectors and donors who support museums since 1999.

==Further activities==
The respective head of the House of Wittelsbach appoints the board of directors of the foundation &quot;Wittelsbach Compensation Fund&quot;, into which most of the possessions from the former &quot;Wittelsbach House Property Fund&quot; were transferred in 1923, including art treasures and collections (in particular the art collection of King Ludwig I, today mostly in the museums Alte Pinakothek and Neue Pinakothek and in the Glyptothek in Munich), the &quot;Secret House Archives&quot; (today a department of the Bavarian State Archives) and the former royal palaces of Berg, Hohenschwangau (including the &quot;Museum of the Bavarian Kings&quot;), Berchtesgaden as well as Grünau hunting lodge. He also appoints one of the board members of the &quot;Wittelsbach State Foundation for Art and Science&quot;, into which the Wittelsbach art treasures acquired before 1800 were brought in in 1923. Since then, this foundation has owned a large part of the holdings of the Munich museums. The former Bavarian Royal Family receives around 14 million Euros in payments annually from the proceeds of the &quot;Wittelsbach Compensation Fund&quot;. The respective head of the family decides on their distribution and use.
As head of the House of Wittelsbach, Franz is also Grand Master of the Wittelsbach House Orders, the Order of Saint George, the Order of St. Hubert and the Order of Theresa. Furthermore, he is president of the Bavarian Order Provinces of the Knights&#x27; Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

In addition to modern art and contemporary music, Franz&#x27; interest lies in the sciences, where he supported the development and expansion of the Bavarian research landscape. He was a member of the board of trustees of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the Technical University of Munich, the Munich School of Philosophy, the Deutsches Museum and the Institute for Bavarian History. As a patron, he heads numerous other organizations, such as the Bavarian Sports Shooting Association.

There is traditionally a close connection between the House of Wittelsbach and the Roman Catholic Church, especially with the respective Archbishop of Munich, but also with various orders such as the Benedictines and Franciscans. Franz worked voluntarily for many years in the management of the &quot;Catholic Academy in Bavaria&quot;. He expanded these relationships through contacts with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria and the Jewish communities in Bavaria. In 2007 he institutionalized this network as co-founder of the &quot;Nymphenburg Talks&quot;, a platform for intercultural and interfaith dialogue that also includes Muslim representatives.
Franz maintained the tradition founded by his father of holding a large annual reception with a sit-down dinner at Nymphenburg Palace where he lives in a side-wing. Around 1,500 mostly changing guests from state politics, municipalities, churches and sciences, art and medicine as well as friends and relatives are invited. He also invites smaller groups of changing guests to Berchtesgaden Palace to discuss specific topics that are important to him.

His 80th birthday party, in 2013, was held at the Schleissheim Palace near Munich. The party was attended by 2,500 guests, including the then-incumbent Minister-President of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer.

== Personal life and succession ==
Franz has had a life partner since 1980, Thomas Greinwald, although they have never married. In August 2011, the duke appeared at Prince George Frederick of Prussia&#x27;s wedding, accompanied by Greinwald and his first cousin once removed – and future heir – Prince Ludwig. He and Greinwald first appeared publicly as a couple in Munich in 2023. The heir presumptive to the headship of the House of Wittelsbach is his brother Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria. Because Max has five daughters but no sons, he is followed in the Bavarian line of succession by his and Franz&#x27;s first cousin (second cousin in the male line) Prince Luitpold and, in the next generation, by the latter&#x27;s son Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (born 1982).

Franz is a descendant of the House of Stuart. Were it not for the Act of Settlement 1701, Franz would be the successor to the English, Scottish, and Irish crowns of the Stuart kings. Franz&#x27;s spokesman has, however, made it clear that this is a purely &quot;hypothetical issue&quot;, &quot;an entirely British question which does not concern him&quot; and not a claim that he pursues. In his memoirs, Franz describes this claim to the British throne as a &quot;charming historical curiosity.&quot;

<text>Hulbert Harrington Warner (1842–1923) was a Rochester, New York businessman and philanthropist who made his fortune from the sales of patent medicine.

==Biography==
He was born near Syracuse, New York, in a small settlement called Warners. Warners had been named for Warner&#x27;s grandfather, Seth, who had moved there in 1807 from Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In 1865, Warner moved to Michigan to engage in the stove and hardware business. In 1870, Warner moved to Rochester and entered into the first business that would make him a millionaire, selling fire- and burglar-proof safes. The demand for safes had escalated dramatically after the discovery of oil in western Pennsylvania; by decade&#x27;s end, it is estimated that Warner and his sales agents had sold 60,000 safes worth an estimated $10 million ($ in present terms).

==Marriage and children==

Warner was married twice. He married Martha L. Keeney of Skaneateles, New York in 1864. Martha died suddenly in 1871, and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Skaneateles.

In 1872, Warner remarried, this time to Emily Olive Stoddard of Michigan. Although the details of his second marriage remain vague, it appears that Warner and Stoddard separated in 1893. It appears that the couple may have had one child, Maud, but there is little information available about her.

Warner later lived with Christina de Martinez of Mexico. Warner and Martinez were never actually married (and it appears that Warner and Stoddard were never divorced), but Martinez took Warner&#x27;s name as her own and they resided in the same household after Warner moved to Minneapolis.

==Patent medicines==

=== Safe Cure ===

Based upon the history recounted in Warner&#x27;s early almanacs, Warner used a portion of the wealth he accumulated from the safe business to purchase the formula for a patent medicine from Dr. Charles Craig of Rochester. Warner developed an unexpectedly severe case of Bright&#x27;s disease, a kidney disease. While close to death, Warner used a vegetable concoction sold by Craig and was restored to health. Based upon his admiration for Craig&#x27;s Original Kidney Cure, Warner purchased the formula and the rights to the product and in 1879 introduced Warner&#x27;s Safe Kidney &amp; Liver Cure.

Although Warner&#x27;s early publications herald Craig&#x27;s potion as a revelation, references to Craig soon disappeared from Warner&#x27;s advertising, and ultimately the two ended up in court when Craig attempted to reenter the patent medicine business with a cure remarkably similar to the one he had sold to Warner.

In addition to his Kidney &amp; Liver Cure, Warner also introduced a Safe Nervine, Safe Diabetes Cure, Safe Tonic, Safe Tonic Bitters, Safe Bitters, Safe Rheumatic Cure, Safe Pills, and later his Tippecanoe Bitters. The Warner&#x27;s patent medicine products, with the exception of the Safe Pills and Tippecanoe, appeared in a unique bottle, which featured an embossed safe on the front. This drew upon his earlier business and implied to his potential customers that his product posed no risk.

In January, 1884, Warner opened his new Rochester headquarters in a lavish multi-story building on St. Paul Street. The H. H. Warner Building became the centerpiece of his medicine production and turned out an estimated of Safe Cure per day. It also served as the headquarters for his promotional department, which published an untold number of almanac and advertising circulars distributed with his medicines to local druggists and grocers. The Warner Building still exists today and houses a variety of businesses. Its granite façade still bears the initial &quot;W&quot;.

=== Log Cabin Remedies ===

In 1887, Warner introduced a new product line, which he called his Log Cabin Remedies. Unlike his Safe Cures, these products appeared in amber bottles with three slanted panels with the name of the particular remedy embossed. The bottles were in red, white, blue, and yellow boxes that featured the image of a log cabin viewed from a window. The Log Cabin Remedies did not replace the Safe Cure line; they only supplemented it. Warner realized that the nation was in a head-long race for expansion westward and his marketing pitch appealed to the American desire for self-reliance. Indeed, the entire thrust of Warner&#x27;s marketing from its inception can best be described as appealing to his customer&#x27;s desire to &quot;heal thyself&quot;.

=== Warner&#x27;s Foreign Offices ===

Based upon his success in marketing his Safe Cure products in the United States, Warner quickly decided to expand his operation internationally. In 1883, he opened offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and London, England. The bottles from Toronto have become known as &quot;3-Cities&quot;, because they featured the names of all of his offices at that time: Rochester, London, and Toronto.

In 1887, he opened offices in Melbourne, Australia and Frankfurt, Germany. In 1888, he expanded to Pressburg in Hungary; however, this office lasted only two years. In 1891, he opened an office in Dunedin, New Zealand; the bottles from that office have become known as &quot;4-Cities&quot;, bearing the names of Rochester, Toronto, London, and Melbourne. The Dundein office was likely little more than a laboratory and, in fact, bottles from the Melbourne and Dundein offices were likely produced in either Rochester or London and shipped to the southern-hemisphere offices due to the primitive state of glass production that existed there at the time.

Warner&#x27;s advertising also boasts offices in Kreuslingen, Switzerland; Brussels; and Paris. No bottles with these cities embossed have ever appeared, and only one bottle labeled in French is known to exist.

Warner&#x27;s offices lasted well into the 20th century, with the Rochester office closing around 1944.

== Philanthropy and failure ==

Having made millions on his second business in patent medicine, Warner embarked on various philanthropic endeavors, most notably his sponsorship of the Warner Observatory in Rochester.

Prior to opening his patent medicine business, Warner had chanced to meet Dr. Lewis Swift, an astronomer, who was ready to leave Rochester for Colorado when Warner convinced him to stay and operate his new observatory. The observatory was completed in 1883 at the then-staggering cost of $100,000 (in current terms, $). It was equipped with a state-of-the-art telescope and was pronounced as being the best-equipped private observatory in the world.

The Observatory was used as a marketing centerpiece by Warner. His almanacs at the time ran essay contents and featured images of the Observatory. Swift used the Observatory to good end, and reportedly discovered six new comets and 900 nebulae.

At one point, Warner offered a reward of $200 for each new comet discovered. This offer was of great help to the young astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, who claimed eight such awards and used the proceeds to set himself and his new wife up in a newly built house in Nashville, Tennessee.

Astronomer Swift and his telescope left Rochester in 1894. The Observatory was demolished in December, 1931.

Warner also used his money to construct a lavish mansion for himself on East Avenue in Rochester. The house fell into disuse and was later demolished.

Warner&#x27;s patent-medicine empire reached its pinnacle in the late 1880s and began its gradual decline. Flush with success, Warner spent money on highly speculative investments in mining, all of which failed. In an effort to generate more capital, he took the company public, which did generate some revenue.

He sold the company to an English investment group in 1889, which incorporated it as H. H. Warner &amp; Co., Ltd. Warner bought up 80 percent of the English stock, and took the position of managing director of the company. However, Warner&#x27;s speculative investments and his waning interest in the business took its toll. When the Panic of 1893 hit, Warner was unable to generate additional capital through stock sales, forcing him into bankruptcy. The American branch of his company was sold to a group of Rochester investors, who continued to operate it as the Warner&#x27;s Safe Remedies Company.

== Life After Safe Cure ==

After failing in Rochester, Warner lived for a time in New York City, then moved to Philadelphia, where he may have attempted to start a new patent medicine business, although this is unconfirmed. He ultimately landed in Minneapolis, where he promoted the Nuera Manufacturing Co., also known as Neura Remedy Co., with the help of his common-law wife Christina de Martinez. He also operated the Warner Renowned Remedies Company, which produced some products offered by mail order.

Warner died in January, 1923, and is buried alongside his first wife, Martha, in Lakeview Cemetery in Skaneateles, NY.

His legacy is his patent medicine empire that produced remedies sold around the world as well as the bottles in which those remedies were contained. The bottles are prized by collectors.

<text>Japanese poetry is poetry typical of Japan, or written, spoken, or chanted in the Japanese language, which includes Old Japanese, Early Middle Japanese, Late Middle Japanese, and Modern Japanese, as well as poetry in Japan which was written in the Chinese language or &quot;ryūka&quot; from the Okinawa Islands: it is possible to make a more accurate distinction between Japanese poetry written in Japan or by Japanese people in other languages versus that written in the Japanese language by speaking of Japanese-language poetry. Much of the literary record of Japanese poetry begins when Japanese poets encountered Chinese poetry during the Tang dynasty (although the Chinese classic anthology of poetry, &quot;Shijing&quot;, was well known by the literati of Japan by the 6th century). Under the influence of the Chinese poets of this era Japanese began to compose poetry in Chinese (&quot;kanshi&quot;); and, as part of this tradition, poetry in Japan tended to be intimately associated with pictorial painting, partly because of the influence of Chinese arts, and the tradition of the use of ink and brush for both writing and drawing. It took several hundred years to digest the foreign impact and make it an integral part of Japanese culture and to merge this &quot;kanshi&quot; poetry into a Japanese language literary tradition, and then later to develop the diversity of unique poetic forms of native poetry, such as &quot;waka&quot;, &quot;haikai&quot;, and other more Japanese poetic specialties. For example, in the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; both &quot;kanshi&quot; and &quot;waka&quot; are frequently mentioned. The history of Japanese poetry goes from an early semi-historical/mythological phase, through the early Old Japanese literature inclusions, just before the Nara period, the Nara period itself (710 to 794), the Heian period (794 to 1185), the Kamakura period (1185 to 1333), and so on, up through the poetically important Edo period (1603 to 1867, also known as &quot;Tokugawa&quot;) and modern times; however, the history of poetry often is different from socio-political history.

==Japanese poetry forms==
Since the middle of the 19th century, the major forms of Japanese poetry have been &quot;tanka&quot; (the modern name for &quot;waka&quot;), &quot;haiku&quot; and &quot;shi&quot; or western-style poetry. Today, the main forms of Japanese poetry include both experimental poetry and poetry that seeks to revive traditional ways. Poets writing in tanka, haiku and shi may seldom write poetry other than in their specific chosen form, although some active poets are eager to collaborate with poets in other genres. The history of Japanese poetry involves both the evolution of Japanese as a language, the evolution of Japanese poetic forms, and the collection of poetry into anthologies, many by imperial patronage and others by the &quot;schools&quot; or the disciples of famous poets (or religion, in the case of the &quot;Bussokusekika&quot;). The study of Japanese poetry is complicated by the social context within which it occurred, in part because of large scale political and religious factors such as clan politics or Buddhism, but also because the collaborative aspect which has often typified Japanese poetry. Also, much of Japanese poetry features short verse forms, often collaborative, which are then compiled into longer collections, or else are interspersed within the prose of longer works. Older forms of Japanese poetry include &quot;kanshi&quot;, which shows a strong influence from Chinese literature and culture.

===&quot;Kanshi&quot;===

&quot;Kanshi&quot; literally means &quot;Han poetry&quot; and it is the Japanese term for Chinese poetry in general as well as the poetry written in Chinese by Japanese poets. &quot;Kanshi&quot; from the early Heian period exists in the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot; anthology, compiled in 751.

===&quot;Waka&quot;===

&quot;Waka&quot; is a type of poetry in classical Japanese literature. Unlike &quot;kanshi&quot;, &quot;waka&quot; refers to poetry composed in Japanese. &quot;Waka&quot; is sometimes also used in the more specific and restrictive sense of poetry which is in Japanese and which is also in the &quot;tanka&quot; form. The anthology preserves from the eighth century 265 &quot;chōka&quot; (long poems), 4,207 &quot;tanka&quot; (short poems), one &quot;tan-renga&quot; (short connecting poem), one &quot;bussokusekika&quot; (a poem in the form 5–7–5–7–7–7; named for the poems inscribed on the Buddha&#x27;s footprints at Yakushi-ji in Nara), four &quot;kanshi&quot; (Chinese poems), and 22 Chinese prose passages. However, by the time of the tenth-century &quot;Kokinshū&quot; anthology, &quot;waka&quot; had become the standard term used for short poems of the &quot;tanka&quot; form, until more recent times.

===&quot;Tanka&quot;===

&quot;Tanka&quot; is poetry of 31 characters. It is written in the rhythm of 5-7-5-7-7 in Japanese. The &quot;tanka&quot; form has shown some modern revival in popularity. As previously stated, it used to be called waka.

===Collaborative verse===
Much traditional Japanese poetry was written as the result of a process of two or more poets contributing verses to a larger piece, such as in the case of the &quot;renga&quot; form. Typically, the &quot;honored guest&quot; composing a few beginning lines, often in the form of the &quot;hokku&quot; (which, as a stand-alone piece, eventually evolved into the haiku). This initial sally was followed by a stanza composed by the &quot;host.&quot; This process could continue, sometimes with many stanzas composed by numerous other &quot;guests&quot;, until the final conclusion. Other collaborative forms of Japanese poetry also evolved, such as the &quot;renku&quot; (&quot;linked-verse&quot;) form. In other cases, the poetry collaborations were more competitive, such as with &quot;uta-awase&quot; gatherings, in which Heian period poets composed &quot;waka&quot; poems on set themes, with a judge deciding the winner(s).

===Haiku===

&quot;Haiku&quot; is a short verse genre written in one line in Japanese and commonly three lines in English and other languages. It has achieved significant global popularity, having been adapted from Japanese into many other languages. Typical of Japanese haiku is the metrical pattern of 5, 7, and 5 &quot;on&quot; (also known as morae). Other features include the juxtaposition of two images or ideas with a &quot;kireji&quot; (&quot;cutting word&quot;) between them, and a &quot;kigo&quot;, or seasonal reference, usually drawn from a &quot;saijiki&quot;, or traditional list of such words. Many haiku are objective in their depiction of personal experiences.

==Japanese poetry anthologies==

Much of Japanese poetry has been transmitted historically through published anthologies, many of them with imperial patronage. Important collections are the , , &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;, and the .

== Early history and prehistory ==

The history of Japanese poetry is tied to the history of Japanese literature, that is in the purely historical sense of having extant written records. However, the early pre-history and mythology of Japan involve or include some references to poetry. And, the earliest preserved works in the Japanese language also preserve some previous poetry from this earlier period.

===Mythology===
According to Japanese mythology, poetry began, not with people, but with the celestial deities, the goddess Izanami and the god Izanagi. They were said to have walked around the world pillar, and encountered each other. The goddess spoke first, saying the following verse:

::::::&quot;What joy beyond compare&quot;
::::::&quot;To see a man so fair!&quot;

The male god, angry that the female had spoken first told her to go away and return later. When they again met, the male god spoke first, saying the following verse:

::::::&quot;To see a woman so fair—&quot;
::::::&quot;What joy beyond compare!&quot;

===Chinese influence===
Chinese literature was introduced into Japan ca the 6th century CE, mostly through the Korean peninsula. Just as the Chinese writing itself, Chinese literature, historical writings, religious scriptures and poetry laid the foundation for Japanese literature proper. Such influence is somewhat comparable to the influence of Latin on the European languages and literature.

In the court of Emperor Tenmu ( – 686) some nobles wrote Chinese language poetry (&quot;kanshi&quot;). Chinese literacy was a sign of education and most high courtiers wrote poetry in Chinese. Later these works were collected in the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot;, one of the earliest anthologies of poetry in Japan, edited in the early Heian period. Thanks to this book the death poem of Prince Ōtsu is still extant today.

The strong influence of Chinese poetics may be seen in Kakyō Hyōshiki. In the 772 text, Fujiwara no Hamanari attempts to apply phonetic rules for Chinese poetry to Japanese poetry.

Many of the Tang Dynasty poets achieved fame in Japan, such as Meng Haoran (Mōkōnen), Li Bo (Ri Haku), and Bai Juyi (Haku Kyo&#x27;i). In many cases, when these poets were introduced to Europe and the Americas, the source was via Japan and a Japanese influence could be seen in the pronunciations of the names of the poets, as well as the accompanying critical analysis or commentary upon the poets or their works.

== Nara period ==

The Nara period (710 to 794) began in Japan, in 710, with the move of the Japanese capital moved from Fujiwara (today&#x27;s Asuka, Nara) to Nara. It was the period when Chinese influence reached a culmination. During the Nara period, Tōdai-ji (&quot;Great Temple of the East&quot;) was established together with the creation of the Great Buddha of Nara, by order of Emperor Shōmu. The significant &quot;waka&quot; poets in this period were Ōtomo no Tabito, Yamanoue no Okura, and Yamabe no Akahito.

=== Early poems recorded ===
The oldest written work in Japanese literature is &quot;Kojiki&quot; in 712, in which Ō no Yasumaro recorded Japanese mythology and history as recited by Hieda no Are, to whom it was handed down by his ancestors. Many of the poetic pieces recorded by the &quot;Kojiki&quot; were perhaps transmitted from the time the Japanese had no writing. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the oldest history of Japan which was finished eight years later than the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, also contains many poetic pieces. These were mostly not long and had no fixed forms. The first poem documented in both books was attributed to a kami (god), named Susanoo, the younger brother of Amaterasu. When he married Princess Kushinada in Izumo Province, the kami made an &quot;uta&quot;, or &quot;waka&quot;, a poem.
:
This is the oldest waka (poem written in Japanese) and hence poetry was later praised as having been founded by a kami, a divine creation.

The two books shared many of the same or similar pieces but &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; contained newer ones because it recorded later affairs (up till the reign of Emperor Tenmu) than &quot;Kojiki&quot;. Themes of waka in the books were diverse, covering love, sorrow, satire, war cries, praise of victory, riddles and so on. Many works in &quot;Kojiki&quot; were anonymous. Some were attributed to kami, emperors and empresses, nobles, generals, commoners and sometimes enemies of the court. Most of these works are considered collectively as &quot;works of the people&quot;, even where attributed to someone, such as the kami Susanoo. 

== Heian period ==
The Heian period (794 to 1185) in Japan was one of both extensive general linguistic and mutual poetic development, in Japan. Developments include the Kanbun system of writing by means of adapting Classical Chinese for use in Japan by using a process of annotation, and the further development of the kana writing system from the Man&#x27;yōgana of the Nara period, encouraging more vernacular poetry, developments in the &quot;waka&quot; form of poetry. The Heian era was also one in which developed an increasing process of writing poems (sometimes collaboratively) and collecting them into anthologies, which in the case of the Kokin Wakashū were given a level of prestige, due to imperial patronage.

=== &quot;Waka&quot; in the early Heian period ===
It is thought the reached its final form, the one we know today, very early in the Heian period. There are strong grounds for believing that Ōtomo no Yakamochi was the final editor but some documents claim further editing was done in the later period by other poets including Sugawara no Michizane.

Though there was a strong inclination towards Chinese poetry, some eminent waka poets were active in the early Heian period, including the six best waka poets.

=== Man&#x27;yōshū anthology ===
Compiled sometime after 759, the oldest poetic anthology of waka is the 20 volume , in the early part of the Heian period, it gathered ancient works. The order of its sections is roughly chronological. Most of the works in the have a fixed form today called chōka and tanka. But earlier works, especially in Volume I, lacked such fixed form and were attributed to Emperor Yūryaku.

The begins with a waka without fixed form. It is both a love song for an unknown girl whom the poet met by chance and a ritual song praising the beauty of the land. It is worthy of being attributed to an emperor and today is used in court ritual.

The first three sections contain mostly the works of poets from the middle of the 7th century to the early part of the 8th century. Significant poets among them were Nukata no Ōkimi and Kakinomoto no Hitomaro. Kakinomoto Hitomaro was not only the greatest poet in those early days and one of the most significant in the , he rightly has a place as one of the most outstanding poets in Japanese literature.
The also included many female poets who mainly wrote love poems. The poets of the were aristocrats who were born in Nara but sometimes lived or traveled in other provinces as bureaucrats of the emperor. These poets wrote down their impressions of travel and expressed their emotion for lovers or children. Sometimes their poems criticized the political failure of the government or tyranny of local officials. Yamanoue no Okura wrote a chōka, &quot;A Dialogue of two Poormen&quot; (貧窮問答歌, Hinkyū mondōka); in this poem two poor men lamented their severe lives of poverty. One hanka is as follows:

:世の中を　憂しとやさしと　おもへども　飛び立ちかねつ　鳥にしあらねば
:Yononaka wo / Ushi to yasashi to / Omo(h)e domo / Tobitachi kanetsu / Tori ni shi arane ba
:I feel the life is / sorrowful and unbearable / though / I can&#x27;t flee away / since I am not a bird.

The contains not only poems of aristocrats but also those of nameless ordinary people. These poems are called &quot;Yomibito shirazu&quot; (よみびと知らず), poems whose author is unknown. Among them there is a specific style of waka called &quot;Azuma-uta&quot; (東歌), waka written in the Eastern dialect. Azuma, meaning the East, designated the eastern provinces roughly corresponding to Kantō and occasionally Tōhoku. Those poems were filled with rural flavors. There was a specific style among Azuma-uta, called &quot;Sakimori uta&quot; (防人歌), waka by soldiers sent from the East to defend Northern Kyushu area. They were mainly waka by drafted soldiers leaving home. These soldiers were drafted in the eastern provinces and were forced to work as guards in Kyūshū for several years. Sometimes their poetry expressed nostalgia for their faraway homeland.

Tanka is a name for and a type of poem found in the , used for shorter poems. The name was later given new life by Masaoka Shiki (pen-name of Masaoka Noboru, October 14, 1867 – September 19, 1902).

===&quot;Kanshi&quot; in the Heian period===

In the early Heian period kanshi—poetry written in Chinese by Japanese—was the most popular style of poetry among Japanese aristocrats. Some poets like Kūkai studied in China and were fluent in Chinese. Others like Sugawara no Michizane had grown up in Japan but understood Chinese well. When they hosted foreign diplomats, they communicated not orally but in writing, using kanji or Chinese characters. In that period, Chinese poetry in China had reached one of its greatest flowerings. Major Chinese poets of the Tang dynasty like Li Po were their contemporaries and their works were well known to the Japanese. Some who went to China for study or diplomacy made the acquaintance of these major poets. The most popular styles of kanshi were in 5 or 7 syllables (onji) in 4 or 8 lines, with very strict rules of rhyme. Japanese poets became skilled in those rules and produced much good poetry. Some long poems with lines of 5 or 7 syllables were also produced. These, when chanted, were referred to as shigin – a practice which continues today.

Emperor Saga himself was proficient at kanshi. He ordered the compilation of three anthologies of kanshi. These were the first of the imperial anthologies, a tradition which continued till the Muromachi period.

=== &quot;Roei&quot; style &quot;waka&quot; ===
Roei was a favored style of reciting poetical works at that time. It was a way of reciting in voice, with relatively slow and long tones. Not whole poetic pieces but a part of classics were quoted and recited by individuals usually followed by a chorus. Fujiwara no Kintō (966–1041) compiled &quot;Wakan rōeishū&quot; (&quot;Sino-Japanese Anthology for Rōei&quot;, ca. 1013) from Japanese and Chinese poetry works written for roei. One or two lines were quoted in &quot;Wakan rōeishū&quot; and those quotations were grouped into themes like Spring, Travel, Celebration.

=== &quot;Waka&quot; in the context of elite culture ===

&quot;Kuge&quot; refers to a Japanese aristocratic class, and &quot;waka&quot; poetry was a significant feature of their typical lifestyle, and this includes the &quot;nyobo&quot; or court ladies. In ancient times, it was a custom for &quot;kuge&quot; to exchange waka instead of letters in prose. Sometimes improvised waka were used in daily conversation in high society. In particular, the exchange of waka was common between lovers. Reflecting this custom, five of the twenty volumes of the (or &quot;Kokinshū&quot;) gathered waka for love. In the Heian period the lovers would exchange waka in the morning when lovers parted at the woman&#x27;s home. The exchanged waka were called &quot;Kinuginu&quot; (後朝), because it was thought the man wanted to stay with his lover and when the sun rose he had almost no time to don his clothes which had been laid out in place of a mattress (as was the custom in those days). Soon, writing and reciting Waka became a part of aristocratic culture. People recited a piece of appropriate waka freely to imply something on an occasion. In the &quot;Pillow Book&quot; it is written that a consort of Emperor Murakami memorized over 1,000 waka in &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; with their description.

&quot;Uta-awase&quot;, ceremonial waka recitation contests, developed in the middle of the Heian period. The custom began in the reign of Emperor Uda (r. 887 through 897), the father of Emperor Daigo (r. 897 through 930) who ordered the compilation of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;. It was &#x27;team combat&#x27; on proposed themes grouped in similar manner to the grouping of poems in the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;. Representatives of each team recited a waka according to their theme and the winner of the round won a point. The team with the higher overall score won the contest. Both winning poet and team received a certain prize. Holding Uta-awase was expensive and possible only for Emperors or very high ranked kuge.

The size of Uta-awase increased. Uta-awase were recorded with hundreds of rounds. Uta-awase motivated the refinement of waka technique but also made waka formalistic and artificial. Poets were expected to create a spring waka in winter or recite a poem of love or lamentation without real situations.

Emperor Ichijō (980–1011) and courts of his empresses, concubines and other noble ladies were a big pool of poets as well as men of the courts.

&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; (begun during the 990s and completed in 1002) and &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 978 – c. 1014 or 1025), from the early 11th century of the Heian period, provide us with examples of the life of aristocrats in the court of Emperor Ichijō and his empresses. Murasaki Shikibu wrote over 3,000 tanka for her &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; in the form of waka her characters wrote in the story. In the story most of those waka were created as an exchange of letters or a conversation. Many classic works of both waka and kanshi were quoted by the nobles. Among those classic poets, the Chinese Tang-dynasty poet Bai Juyi (Po Chü-i) had a great influence on the culture of the middle Heian period. Bai Juyi was quoted by both &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; and &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;, and his &quot;A Song of unending Sorrow&quot; (長恨歌), whose theme was a tragic love between the Chinese Emperor and his concubine, inspired Murasaki Shikibu to imagine tragic love affairs in the Japanese imperial court in her &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;.

=== Fujiwara no Teika ===

Fujiwara no Teika (1162 to 1241) was a waka poet, critic, scribe and editor of the late Heian period and the early Kamakura period. Fujiwara no Teika had three lines of descendants: the Nijō, Reizei family and Kyōgoku family. Besides that, various members of the Fujiwara family are noted for their work in the field of poetry.

=== &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; anthology ===
In the middle of the Heian period Waka revived with the compilation of the Kokin Wakashū. It was edited on the order of Emperor Daigo. About 1,000 waka, mainly from the late Nara period till the contemporary times, were anthologized by five waka poets in the court including Ki no Tsurayuki who wrote the 

The Kana preface to Kokin Wakashū was the second earliest expression of literary theory and criticism in Japan (the earliest was by Kūkai). Kūkai&#x27;s literary theory was not influential, but Kokin Wakashū set the types of waka and hence other genres which would develop from waka.

The collection is divided into twenty parts, reflecting older models such as the and various Chinese anthologies. The organisation of topics is however different from all earlier models, and was followed by all later official collections, although some collections like the &quot;Kin&#x27;yō Wakashū&quot; and &quot;Shika Wakashū&quot; reduced the number of parts to ten. The parts of the Kokin Wakashū are ordered as follows: Parts 1–6 covered the four seasons, followed by congratulatory poems, poetry at partings, and travel poems. The last ten sections included poetry on the &#x27;names of things&#x27;, love, laments, occasional poems, miscellaneous verse, and finally traditional and ceremonial poems from the Bureau of Poetry.

The compilers included the name of the author of each poem, and the topic (題 &quot;dai&quot;) or inspiration of the poem, if known. Major poets of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; include Ariwara no Narihira, Ono no Komachi, Henjō and Fujiwara no Okikaze, apart from the compilers themselves. Inclusion in any imperial collection, and particularly the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, was a great honour.

=== Influence of &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; ===
The &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; is the first of the &quot;Nijūichidaishū&quot;, the 21 collections of Japanese poetry compiled at Imperial request. It was the most influential realization of the ideas of poetry at the time, dictating the form and format of Japanese poetry until the late nineteenth century. The primacy of poems about the seasons pioneered by the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; continues even today in the &quot;haiku&quot; tradition. The Japanese preface by Ki no Tsurayuki is also the beginning of Japanese criticism as distinct from the far more prevalent Chinese poetics in the literary circles of its day. (The anthology also included a traditional Chinese preface authored by Ki no Tomonori.) The idea of including old as well as new poems was another important innovation, one which was widely adopted in later works, both in prose and verse. The poems of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; were ordered temporally; the love poems, for instance, depict the progression and fluctuations of a courtly love-affair. This association of one poem to the next marks this anthology as the ancestor of the &quot;renga&quot; and &quot;haikai&quot; traditions.

== Period of cloistered rule ==

The period of cloistered rule overlapped the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the Kamakura period. Cloistered rule &quot;(Insei)&quot; refers to an emperor &quot;retiring&quot; into a monastery, while continuing to maintain a certain amount of influence and power over worldly affairs, and yet retaining time for poetry or other activities. During this time the Fujiwara clan was also active both politically and poetically. The period of cloistered rule mostly Heian period but continuing into the early Kamakura period, in or around the 12th century, some new movements of poetry appeared.

=== &quot;Imayō&quot; in the period of cloistered rule ===

First a new lyrical form called &quot;imayō&quot; (今様, modern style, a form of &quot;ryūkōka&quot;) emerged. &quot;Imayō&quot; consists of four lines in 8–5 (or 7–5) syllables. Usually it was sung to the accompaniment of instrumental music and dancing. Female dancers (&quot;shirabyōshi&quot;) danced to the accompaniment of &quot;imayō&quot;. Major works were compiled into the &quot;Ryōjin Hishō&quot; (梁塵秘抄) anthology. Although originally women and commoners are thought to be proponents of the genre, Emperor Go-Shirakawa was famed for his mastery of &quot;imayō&quot;.

=== &quot;Waka&quot; in the period of cloistered rule ===

Some new trends appeared in &quot;waka&quot;. There were two opposite trends: an inclination to the contemporary, modern style and on the other hand a revival of the traditional style. Both trends had their schools and won the honor to compile imperial anthologies of waka. Fujiwara no Shunzei and his son Fujiwara no Teika were the leaders of the latter school.

=== &quot;Renga&quot; in the period of cloistered rule ===

Also in this period for the first time &quot;renga&quot; were included in the imperial anthologies of waka. At that time, renga was considered a variant of waka. The renga included were waka created by two persons only, quite unlike the later style which featured many stanzas.

== Kamakura period==

The Kamakura period (1185–1333) is a period of Japanese history that marks the governance by the Kamakura shogunate, officially established in 1192 AD in Kamakura, by the first &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo. The period is known for the emergence of the samurai, the warrior caste, and for the establishment of feudalism in Japan.

===&quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot; anthology===

In the late period rule by cloistered Emperors, or the early Kamakura period (1185–1333), Emperor Go-Toba (1180–1239), who had abdicated, ordered the compilation of the eighth imperial anthology of waka, the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;. Go-Toba himself joined the team of editors. Other editors included Fujiwara no Teika and Kamo no Chōmei.

=== Later Imperial &quot;waka&quot; anthologies ===

The Kamakura period influence continued after the end of the actual period: after the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;, fourteen waka anthologies were compiled under imperial edict: the 13 and the &quot;Shin&#x27;yō Wakashū&quot; (c. 1381). These anthologies reflected the taste of aristocrats (and later, warriors) and were considered the ideal of waka in each period. Moreover, anthologizing served as a proof of cultural legitimacy of the patrons and often had political connotations.

== Nanboku-chō period ==

The Nanboku-chō period (1334–1392) is also known as the &quot;Northern and Southern Courts period&quot;. Poetic movements included Renga developments, such as the publication of the &quot;Tsukubashū&quot; – the first imperial anthology of renga, in about 1356. There were various Renga poets, critics and theories, such as the development of shikimoku (renga rules) and Sōgi. Haikai no renga appears – as a parody of renga &quot;Shinseninutusukbashu&quot;. Noh play and poetry began to develop. There was influence from waka and other poetry, and Noh play reading as verse.

===&quot;Renga&quot;===

&quot;Renga&quot; is a collaborative verse form between two or more poets. &quot;Tsukubashū&quot;, the first imperial anthology of renga, was published in about 1356. This lent imperial prestige to this form of verse.

== Sengoku period ==

The Sengoku period literally derives its name from the Japanese for &quot;warring states&quot;. It was a militarily and politically turbulent period, with nearly constant military conflict which lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, and which during which there were also developments in &quot;renga&quot; and &quot;waka&quot; poetry.

== Pre-modern (Edo/Tokugawa) ==

In the Pre-modern or Edo period (1602–1869) some new styles of poetry developed. One of greatest and most influential styles was renku, (also known as haikai no renga, or haikai), emerging from renga in the medieval period. Matsuo Bashō was a great haikai master and had a wide influence on his contemporaries and later generations. Bashō was also a prominent writer of haibun, a combination of prose and haiku, one famous example being his &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; (or, &quot;The Narrow Road to the Interior&quot;).

The tradition of collaboration between painters and poets had a beneficial influence on poetry in the middle Edo period. In Kyoto there were some artists who were simultaneously poets and painters. Painters of the Shujo school were known as good poets. Among such poet-painters the most significant was Yosa Buson. Buson began his career as a painter but went on to become a master of renku, too. He left many paintings accompanied by his own haiku poems. Such combination of haiku with painting is known as haiga.

Waka underwent a revival, too, in relation to kokugaku, the study of Japanese classics. Kyōka (mad song), a type of satirical waka was also popular.

One poetry school of the era was the Danrin school.

===Hokku===

Hokku renga, or of its later derivative, renku (haikai no renga). From the time of Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), the hokku began to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (in combination with prose).

===Haikai===
Haikai emerged from the renga of the medieval period. Matsuo Bashō was a noted proponent. Related to &quot;hokku&quot; formally, it was generically different.

In the late Edo period, a master of haikai, Karai Senryū made an anthology. His style became known as senryū, after his pseudonym. Senryū is a style of satirical poetry whose motifs are taken from daily life in 5–7–5 syllables. Anthologies of senryū in the Edo period collect many &#x27;maeku&#x27; or senryū made by ordinary amateur senryū poets adding in front of the latter 7–7 part written by a master. It was a sort of poetry contest and the well written senryū by amateurs were awarded by the master and other participants.

== Modern and contemporary ==

A new wave came from the West when Japan was introduced to European and American poetry. This poetry belonged to a very different tradition and was regarded by Japanese poets as a form without any boundaries. &quot;Shintai-shi&quot; (New form poetry) or &quot;Jiyu-shi&quot; (Freestyle poetry) emerged at this time. They still relied on a traditional pattern of 5–7 syllable patterns, but were strongly influenced by the forms and motifs of Western poetry. Later, in the Taishō period (1912 to 1926), some poets began to write their poetry in a much looser metric. In contrast with this development, &quot;kanshi&quot; slowly went out of fashion and was seldom written. As a result, Japanese men of letters lost the traditional background of Chinese literary knowledge. Originally the word &quot;shi&quot; meant poetry, especially Chinese poetry, but today it means mainly modern-style poetry in Japanese. &quot;Shi&quot; is also known as &quot;kindai-shi&quot; (modern poetry). Since World War II, poets and critics have used the name &quot;gendai-shi&quot; (contemporary poetry). This includes the poets Kusano Shinpei, Tanikawa Shuntarō and Ishigaki Rin.

As for the traditional styles such as &quot;waka&quot; and &quot;haiku,&quot; the early modern era was also a time of renovation. Yosano Tekkan and later Masaoka Shiki revived those forms. The words &quot;haiku&quot; and &quot;tanka&quot; were both coined by Shiki. They laid the basis for development of this poetry in the modern world. They introduced new motifs, rejected some old authorities in this field, recovered forgotten classics, and published magazines to express their opinions and lead their disciples. This magazine-based activity by leading poets is a major feature of Japanese poetry even today.

Some poets, including Yosano Akiko, Ishikawa Takuboku, Hagiwara Sakutarō wrote in many styles: they used both traditional forms like waka and haiku and &quot;new style&quot; forms. Most Japanese poets, however, generally write in a single form of poetry.

===Haiku===

Haiku derives from the earlier hokku. The name was given by Masaoka Shiki (pen-name of Masaoka Noboru, October 14, 1867 – September 19, 1902).

===Tanka===

Tanka is poetry of 31 characters. The name for and a type of poem found in the Heian era poetry anthology . The name was given new life by Masaoka Shiki (pen-name of Masaoka Noboru, October 14, 1867 – September 19, 1902).

===Contemporary Poetry===

Japanese Contemporary Poetry consists of poetic verses of today, mainly after the 1900s. It includes vast styles and genres of prose including experimental, sensual, dramatic, erotic, and many contemporary poets today are female. Japanese contemporary poetry like most regional contemporary poem seem to either stray away from the traditional style or fuse it with new forms. Because of a great foreign influence Japanese contemporary poetry adopted more of a western style of poet style where the verse is more free and absent of such rules as fixed syllable numeration per line or a fixed set of lines.

In 1989 the death of Emperor Hirohito officially brought Japan’s postwar period to an end. The category of &quot;postwar&quot;, born out of the cataclysmic events of 1945, had until that time been the major defining image of what contemporary Japanese poetry was all about (The New Modernism, 2010). For poets standing at that border, poetry had to be reinvented just as Japan as a nation began reinventing itself. But while this was essentially a sense of creativity and liberation from militarist oppression, reopening the gates to new form and experimentation, this new boundary crossed in 1989 presented quite a different problem, and in a sense cut just as deeply into the sense of poetic and national identity. The basic grounding “postwar”, with its dependence on the stark differentiation between a Japan before and after the atomic bomb, was no longer available. Identity was no longer so clearly defined (The New Modernism, 2010) In 1990, a most loved and respected member of Japan’s avant-garde and a bridge between Modernist and Post-Modern practice unexpectedly died. Yoshioka Minoru, the very embodiment of what the postwar period meant to Japanese poetry, had influenced virtually all of the younger experimental poets, and received the admiration even of those outside the bounds of that genre (The New Modernism, 2010). The event shocked and dazed Japan’s poetry community, rendering the confusion and loss of direction all the more graphic and painful. Already the limits of “postwar” were being exceeded in the work of Hiraide Takashi and Inagawa Masato. These two poets were blurring the boundary between poetry and criticism, poetry and prose, and questioning conventional ideas of what comprised the modern in Japan (The New Modernism, 2010). Statistically there are about two thousand poets and more than two hundred poetry magazines in Japan today. The poets are divided into five groups: (1) a group publishing the magazine, Vou, under the flag of new humanism; (2) Jikon or time, with neo-realism as their motto, trying to depict the gap between reality and the socialistic ideal as simply as possible; (3) the Communist group; (4) Rekitei or progress, mixing Chinese Han poetry and the traditional Japanese lyric, and (5) Arechi or waste land (Sugiyama, 254).

The Western poets who appeal to the taste of poetry lovers in Japan are principally French: Verlaine, Paul Valéry, Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire; and Rainer Maria Rilke is also a favorite (Sugiyama, 255). English poetry is not very popular except among students of English literature in the universities, although Wordsworth, Shelley, and Browning inspired many of the Japanese poets in the quickening period of modern Japanese poetry freeing themselves from the traditional tanka form into a free verse style only half a century ago (Sugiyama, 256). In more recent women’s poetry, one finds an exploration of the natural rhythms of speech, often in a specifically feminine language rather than a high, literary form, as well as the language of local dialects (The New Modernism, 2010). All of these strategies are expressions of difference, whether sexual or regional, and map out shifting fields of identity in modern Japan against a backdrop of mass culture where these identities might otherwise be lost or overlooked.

The largest anthology of haiku in Japanese is the 12-volume Bunruihaiku-zenshū (Classified Collection of Haiku) compiled by Masaoka Shiki, completed after his death, which collected haiku by seasonal theme and sub-theme. It includes work dating back to the 15th century.

The largest collection of haiku translated into English on any single subject is &quot;Cherry Blossom Epiphany&quot; by Robin D. Gill, which contains some 3,000 Japanese haiku on the subject of the cherry blossom.&lt; Gill, Robin D. &quot;Cherry Blossom Epiphany&quot;, Paraverse Press, 2007 &gt;

H. Mack Horton&#x27;s translation of the 16th-century &quot;Journal of Sōchō&quot;, by a pre-eminent renga poet of the time, won the 2002 Stanford University Press Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature.&lt; Stanford University Press Awards &gt;

<text>The Eurasian Land Bridge (), sometimes called the New Silk Road (, ), is the rail transport route for moving freight and passengers overland between Pacific seaports in the Russian Far East and China and seaports in Europe. The route, a transcontinental railroad and rail land bridge, comprises the Trans-Siberian Railway, which runs through Russia and is sometimes called the Northern East-West Corridor, and the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge, running through China and Kazakhstan. As of November 2007, about one percent of the $600 billion in goods shipped from Asia to Europe each year were delivered by inland transport routes.

Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific seaports such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s until the early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused the use of the railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is use of a wider rail gauge by the railways of the former Russian Empire and Soviet Union than most of the rest of Europe and China.

China&#x27;s rail system had long linked to the Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990, China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its uninterrupted rail link between the port city of Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project, the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.

Proposed expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge includes construction of a railway across Kazakhstan that is the same gauge as Chinese and European railways (standard gauge, as opposed to 1,520 mm gauge in the former Russian Empire and the Soviet Union), rail links to India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, construction of a rail tunnel and highway bridge across the Bering Strait to connect the Trans-Siberian to the North American rail system, and construction of a rail tunnel between South Korea and Japan. The United Nations has proposed further expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge, including the Trans-Asian Railway project.

==History==
Commercial traffic between Europe and Asia took place along the Silk Road from at least the 2nd millennium BC. The Silk Road was not a specific thoroughfare, but a general route used by traders to travel, much of it by land, between the two continents along the Eurasian Steppes through Central Asia. The route was used to exchange goods, ideas and people primarily between China and India and the Mediterranean and helped create a single-world system of trade between the civilisations of Europe and Asia.

Exports from Asia transported along the Silk Road included fabrics, carpets, furs, weapons, utensils, metals, farm produce, livestock and slaves. Civilisations active in trading during the road&#x27;s history included Scythia, Ancient and Byzantine Greece, the Han and Tang dynasties, Parthia, Rouran, Sogdiana, Göktürks, Xiongnu, Yuezhi and the Mongol Empire.

Beginning in the 5th century AD, new land routes between Asia and Europe developed further to the north. Many of these routes passed through Yugra and extended to the Baltic region. The Khazars, Volga Bulgaria, and the Rus&#x27; Khaganate were active in trading along the northern trade routes.

Traffic along the southern Silk Road routes greatly diminished with the fall of Constantinople in the 15th century and development of the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope in the 16th century. By the 18th century, European influence on trade and new national boundaries severely restricted the movement of traders along all land routes between Europe and China, and overland trade between East Asia and Europe virtually disappeared.

==Trans-Siberian Railway==

The Trans-Siberian Railway and its various associated branches and supporting lines, completed in 1916, established the first rail connection between Europe and Asia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. The line, at , is the longest rail line in the world.

The Trans-Siberian connects the Russian Pacific ports of Vladivostok and Nakhodka with Moscow. Rail links at Moscow allow passengers and freight to connect to train lines running further west into Europe. By making further transfers, passengers and freight can eventually reach Western European seaports. The Trans-Siberian also connects with North Korea (e.g. via Dandong in Northeastern China, or directly at Khasan south of Vladivostok).

A fully electrified and double-tracked line, the Trans-Siberian Railway line is capable of transporting around 100 million tons of freight annually. The line can handle up to 200,000 TEU of containerized international transit freight per year.

A more northerly east–west route across Siberia, parallel to the Trans-Siberian line and known as the Baikal–Amur Mainline was mostly completed in 1989. It terminates at the Pacific ports of Vanino and Sovetskaya Gavan. Although this line is comparatively little used (the management mentions 6 million tons of freight per year, not indicating the year), the management expects the line to be fully used in the foreseeable future for oil and copper ore export, and has plans to double-track it.

While the Trans-Siberian has always been used by the Tsarist, Soviet and modern Russian government to project political power into their territories in Asia, in the 1960s it was opened by the USSR as an international trade route connecting the Western Pacific with Europe. Freight shipments on the Trans-Siberian, however, experienced increasing problems over time with dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of containers and geopolitical tension. As a result, use of the railway for international trade had declined to almost zero by the 1990s.

According to Hofstra University, as of 2001 there was renewed interest in using the Trans-Siberian as a route across Asia to Europe. Also, the Trans-Siberian links directly to railways which ultimately connect, via Finland and Sweden, to the year-round ice-free port of Narvik in Norway. At Narvik, freight can be transshipped to ships to cross the Atlantic to North America. Rail links from Russia also connect to Rotterdam, but may encounter greater congestion along this route with resulting delays. The trade route between the east coast of North America and eastern Russia using the Trans-Siberian is often called the Northern East West Freight Corridor.

In an effort to attract use of the Trans-Siberian to transport goods from Japan, China, and Korea to Europe, in the mid-1990s Russia lowered tariffs on freight using the railway. As a result, freight volume over the rail line doubled in 1999 and 2000.

In February and March 2011, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism sponsored a test of the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. The tiles were transported by ship from Hamada, Shimane to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it takes to ship cargo by ship from Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to use the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.

In 2011, a direct container rail service began carrying car parts from Leipzig, Germany, to inland Shenyang, China, through Siberia in 23 days, every day.

In 2013 a direct container, pallet, and general cargo rail service began, from Łódź, Poland, to inland Chengdu, China, through Siberia in 14 days, 3 days each week.

According to Russian statistics, the amount of international container shipments transiting annually through Russia over the Trans-Siberian grew by a factor of 7 between 2009 and 2014, reaching 131,000 TEU (55,000 physical containers) in 2014.

Belarusian Railways reported similar statistics: in 2014, the volume of direct container traffic from China to Western Europe crossing Belarus amounted to 40,600 TEU, on 25 direct container train routes. This constituted over 20% of Belarusian Railway&#x27;s entire volume of container transportation that year, 193,100 TEU. This was still much less than 0.1% of the number of containers that travel via China&#x27;s sea ports (some 170 million TEU).

==China and the land bridge==
===Direct connections between Russia and China===
The original Moscow–Vladivostok route, completed in 1904, cut across China&#x27;s northeastern provinces, or Manchuria; the section of the railway located within China was known as the Chinese Eastern Railway. While the more northerly Trans-Siberian route, located entirely on Russian soil, was completed in 1916, the former Chinese Eastern Railway route continues as an important connector between the two countries&#x27; railway networks.

The western border point (Zabaykalsk/Manzhouli) and the line connecting it to the Trans-Siberian main line, are now being upgraded, with the goal of enabling the railway by 2010 to pass 30 freight trains in each direction across the border, each one up to 71 cars long. The cross-border freight volume at this rail crossing is expected to reach 25.5 million tons by 2010. Besides cargo (principally, Russian oil exported to China), this crossing sees a direct weekly passenger train, Moscow–Beijing, as well as some local passenger trains. The eastern border point of the former Chinese Eastern Railway, at Suifenhe/Grodekovo, sees significant use as well, with over 8 million tons of freight crossing the border there in 2007, and regular cross-border passenger service.

A third, little-known and less used, rail connection between Russia and China was built farther south, between 
Hunchun (in China&#x27;s Jilin province) and Russian Makhalino (a station on the Ussuriysk–Khasan–North Korean border line, before Khasan). It began operating in February 2000, and saw only a minor amount of traffic (678 railcars of lumber) over the next two years. The line was closed in 2002–03, briefly reopened in 2003, and closed again in September 2004. On 15 February 2011, the two companies who own the line, Northeast Asia Railway Group, a Chinese company, and JSC Golden Link, a Russian company, signed an agreement to resume operations on the line in May 2011.

In November 2008, the transport ministries of Russia and the China signed an agreement about creating one more link between the railway systems of the two countries. It will involve a railway bridge between across the Amur (Heilong) River, connecting Tongjiang in China&#x27;s Heilongjiang province with Nizhneleninskoye in Russia&#x27;s Jewish Autonomous Oblast. On 4 November 2010, the project director, Wang Jin, told Xinhua News Agency that construction on the bridge would begin in January 2011.

===Russia to China via Mongolia===
The Trans-Mongolian line, connecting Ulan-Ude on the Trans-Siberian with China&#x27;s Erenhot via the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, both serves as a crucial link to the outside world for landlocked Mongolia, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and Beijing. This line&#x27;s capacity, however, is limited by its being single-track.

===Kazakhstan to China===
While the USSR had long been connected with China via the rail links in Northeastern China and Mongolia, since the 1950s plans existed to connect the two countries&#x27; rail networks at the Kazakhstan/Xinjiang border. The Soviets completed their line from Aktogay (a station on the Turksib in eastern Kazakhstan) to their border station Druzhba (now Dostyk), but the construction on the Chinese side stopped because of the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In 1985 construction commenced on the Northern Xinjiang Railway to link the Chinese and Russian rail networks via Kazakhstan. The section between Ürümqi and Alashankou was completed on 16 September 1990, linking the railway lines of the two countries at Dostyk. In July 1991 the first goods train traveled along the line from China to Kazakhstan&#x27;s then-capital of Almaty. In December 2009, a second rail link from China was built to the Kazakhstan border at Khorgos. The Jinghe–Yining–Khorgos Railway forks off of the Northern Xinjiang Railway at Jinghe and approaches Kazakhstan from the Ili River Valley. A rail link on Kazakh side will extend the line to Saryozek by 2013. The rail link through the Korgas Pass was completed in December 2012.

Because Kazakhstan was once in the Russian Empire and then a member of the USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, as well as the other Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

From Kazakhstan, four major north–south railways connect with the Russian rail system. Two connect with the Trans-Siberian Railway (the Turksib and the Shu–Nur-Sultan–Petropavl meridional line) while the other two (the Trans-Aral Railway, and the connection via Atyrau and Astrakhan Oblast) go directly to European Russia. These links to the Russian rail system are sometimes called the Eurasian Railway. Kazakhstan plays an important role in the &quot;New Silk Road&quot; initiative, known as &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; linking China and Europe through Central Asia and Russia.

A new direction of the Silk Road was launched in January 2016 and included the Ukraine – Georgia – Azerbaijan – Kazakhstan – China route.

Kazakhstan&#x27;s infrastructure development program Nurly Zhol was developed in line with the New Silk Road Initiative. President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev even noted that Nurly zhol was a part of the New Silk Road Economic Belt.

===Through service between China and Western Europe===
There are three main routes for container services from China to Europe: Eastern route from Vostochny Port (Russia), northern route from west China via Manzhouli/Zabaikalsk border stations and southern route from east China via Dostyk border station, through which totally 25k TEU has been transported on rail by 2014.

In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated a long-distance freight train service between Beijing and Hamburg. Travelling a total of , the train uses the China Railways and the Trans-Mongolian line to travel from Xiangtan (in Hunan Province) to Ulaanbaatar, where it then continues north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching the end of the Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.

Hartmut Mehdorn, chairman of Deutsche Bahn (DB), stated in March 2008 that regularly scheduled, weekly China-Germany freight services should be in operation by 2010. In April 2009, however, DB postponed the service indefinitely because of the global economic crisis.

Another test run, from Chongqing to Duisburg via Alashankou crossing, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, and Poland took place in March–April 2011, covering in 16 days. It was again said by DB that if there is enough demand, the service can be made regular already in 2011, As of March 2014, the Chongqing-Duisburg route makes three weekly services carrying up to 50 forty-foot-long containers.


The transportation authorities in another industrial center of central China, Wuhan, plan to organize regular runs of direct freight train between Wuhan and European destinations (Czech Republic, Poland, Germany) starting in April 2014. Plans call for the service starting from 1–2 trains per month in April–June 2014, gradually increasing the frequency to 1–2 trains per week in 2015. A new customs facility is under construction in Wuhan&#x27;s Wujiashan (吴家山) industrial area; after its planned opening in October 2015, exports from the Wuhan region will be able to clear Chinese customs there, instead of Alashankou.

By 2016, the freight rail service between a number of container terminals in China and their counterparts in Europe has become fairly regular. Between some city pairs, there is one train per week.

Both with respect to cost and speed, the China-Europe direct train service is in between the air and sea options. While it is estimated that the overall volume of goods moving between China and Europe by rail is not going to surpass 1–2% of the sea cargo volume, it may eat significantly into the air cargo volume.

The service is typically used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy enough to make the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.

On the European end of the freight route, the rail terminal near Duisburg&#x27;s river port (Ruhrort) is a major destination. According to a 2018 report, Duisburg is either the destination, or one of the destinations, of some 80% of all direct China-Western Europe cargo trains.

===New Eurasian Land Bridge===
The New Eurasian Land Bridge, also called the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China&#x27;s rail link with Central Asia. The route includes China&#x27;s east–west railways which, in addition to the Beijiang line, are the Longhai Railway and the Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway. Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports, and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.

From Almaty in Kazakhstan, the railway extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan and then to Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line continues to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea.

Since 2013, the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route has been operating, which goes through the territory of Kazakhstan to the Port Kuryk, then through the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan (Ələt), then to Georgia, and from the Georgian Poti Sea Port through the Black Sea to the countries of the European Union. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the disruption of previous routes, this route became more relevant.

In 1996 a branch railway from Tejen was constructed across the border with Iran (at Serakhs) and linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways. The link potentially enables rail freight from China to reach ports on the Persian Gulf and via other train lines, to reach into the Caucasus and Turkey. In 2016, direct container train service was inaugurated on this route, between Yiwu (Zhejiang Province) and Teheran; the trip takes 14 days. 

The central Asian route did not extend all the way into Europe until October 2013 when the rail link across the Bosphorus though the Marmaray link was opened. Iranian rail lines use gauge, requiring freight cars transiting from China into Iran to change wheel gauges twice. The train ferry across Lake Van is also a capacity restriction.

Chinese state media claims that the New Eurasian Land/Continental Bridge extends from Lianyungang to Rotterdam, a distance of . The exact route used to connect the two cities, whether through Mongolia or Kazakhstan, however, is unclear.

===Iron Silk Road via Turkey===
An alternative way from China to Europe is via Turkey. The route from China follows Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey. Due to longer distance, insufficient service, and border crossings, this route has not regularly been used for direct transport from China to Europe. 

However, work is underway to improve the viability of this route, such as the Marmaray project to connect Europe and Asia via a tunnel under the Bosphorus. After the completion of the project, a continuous run of trains will be possible between Asia and Europe, which is now done by rail ferry service. But the Marmaray tunnel may give a limited service to freight trains due to dense usage by public transport. On 7 November 2019 the first Chinese freight train through the Marmaray tunnel to Europe ran, from Xi’an using a Chinese locomotive. This demonstrated a China to Turkey transportation time reduced from a month to 12 days.
The Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway also provides a route via the Caspian Sea by bypassing Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter. The new route, in this case, is China–Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey.

===Break of gauge issues===
The former countries of the Russian Empire and USSR, including Finland (which was once part of Russia), as well as Mongolia, use a track gauge of . The international standard gauge used in most of Europe and China is . As a result, trains cannot run from China or European countries into or out of the former USSR without changing bogies. Large facilities to carry out this procedure exist at most border crossing between the &quot;Russian&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; gauge territories (e.g., at Zabaykalsk or Erenhot)
Changing the bogies on a rail car takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, containerized freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead of changing the bogies. As of 2016, this is the usual procedure with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another in as little as 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.

It has been suggested that on some lines variable-gauge axles would achieve significant time savings in comparison to bogie exchange. However, their implementation would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either retrofitting or replacement of existing bogies.

==Proposed development==

===Expansion projects===

On 10 March 2004 the Kazakhstan Railway Company Ltd announced that it was looking for investors to fund the construction of a railway stretching from China across Kazakhstan to the Caspian Sea that would be the same gauge as Chinese railways. Thus, the railway would allow trains from China to cross Kazakhstan without having to change bogies. The reported construction cost of the new railway was $3.5 billion. Chinese media reported that the railway would complete the link between China and Europe via central Asia, but it is unclear where the actual link to Europe would be. Also unclear is whether construction has yet to begin on the project.

The governments of India and Burma have proposed building, with China&#x27;s cooperation, a link to the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India or Burma and connect to the Chinese rail system in Yunnan. The route would allow freight from India and Burma to travel overland to Europe. The link would also give rail access for China to the Indian Ocean. One proposed starting point for the route is Kyaukpyu. The governments of Thailand and Malaysia are also studying the feasibility of establishing rail links with China.

Both Russia and China are seeking to establish a permanent rail link with South Korea by way of North Korea to allow South Korean goods to be shipped to Europe via the Eurasian Land Bridge. According to Choi Yeon-Hye, a professor of marketing and management at the Korea National Railway College, a rail connection from Busan to Rotterdam would cut shipping time from 26 to 16 days and save $800 per container of freight. As part of its plan to link the Trans-Siberian to North and South Korea, Russia rebuilt its rail link from Khasan to Rajin, finishing in October 2011.

The South Korean government announced on 2 December 2009 that it would conduct an economic and technical study on the feasibility of constructing undersea tunnels for transporting goods and people to and from the country directly to Kyushu, Japan and Shandong, China.

The United Nations Development Programme has advocated greater regional integration along the Eurasian Land Bridge, including development of rail links between the countries of South and Southeast Asia and Central Asia, called the Trans-Asian Railway project. Chinese leaders have called for the establishment of free trade zones at both ends of the Eurasian Land Bridge to facilitate development. Said Khalid Malik, United Nations Resident Coordinator in China, &quot;If this comes true, it will enable the continental bridge to play its due role in enhancing co-operation between Asia and Europe, and promoting world peace and development.&quot;

In 2010 and 2011, China announced plans to finance expansion of the rail systems in Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam and connect them to China&#x27;s rail system via Kunming. The plans include construction of a high-speed rail line from Kunming to Vientiane, beginning in April 2011, with a possible future extension to Bangkok.

On 15 December 2011, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced that a rail link was being considered between Sakhalin Island and Japan. The rail line, constructed in an undersea tunnel, would link Japan to the Trans-Siberian.

===Bering Strait link===

In April 2007 the Russian government announced that it was considering building a double track broad gauge rail tunnel under the Bering Strait between Chukotka and Alaska. The tunnel, as projected, would be long and would include oil and gas pipelines, fiber optic cables and power lines. The tunnel project was estimated to cost $65 billion and take between 15 and 20 years to build. In addition to the Russian government, sponsors of the project apparently include Transneft and RAO United Energy Systems.

The project, as envisioned, would connect the Trans-Siberian via Komsomolsk-on-Amur/Yakutsk in Siberian Russia with the North American rail network (gauge to be widened) at Fort Nelson, British Columbia, Canada, a distance of . A significant hurdle for the project is that the nearest major road to the Russian end of the tunnel is away. In addition, Alaska has no direct rail link to either Canada or the contiguous United States. Other leaders, including Wally Hickel, Lyndon LaRouche, Sun Myung Moon, and the 14th Dalai Lama have also advocated the construction of a tunnel or bridge across the strait.

===High-speed rail===
It was reported in the press in March 2007 that China intends to build a high-speed rail link between China and Western Europe with the possibility of a high-speed rail journey from Beijing to London taking just two days.

In February 2011, the Chinese government announced that it would jointly sponsor the construction of a high-speed rail line between Astana and Almaty in Kazakhstan. The announced completion date was 2015.

<doc id="774035" wikidata="Q880411" url="?curid=774035" title="Marshall Jewell">
<text>Marshall Jewell (October 20, 1825 – February 10, 1883) was a manufacturer, pioneer telegrapher, telephone entrepreneur, world traveler, and political figure who served as 44th and 46th Governor of Connecticut, the US Minister to Russia, the 25th United States Postmaster General, and Republican Party National Chairman. Jewell, distinguished for his fine &quot;china&quot; skin, grey eyes, and white eyebrows, was popularly known as the &quot;Porcelain Man&quot;. As Postmaster General, Jewell made reforms and was intent on cleaning up the Postal Service from internal corruption and profiteering. Postmaster Jewell helped Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow shut down and prosecute the Whiskey Ring. President Grant, however, became suspicious of Jewell&#x27;s loyalty after Jewell fired a Boston postmaster over non payment of a surety bond and asked for his resignation.

A native of New Hampshire, Jewell was the son of a prominent tanner and currier. Having apprenticed in his father&#x27;s tannery business, Jewell moved to Boston where he learned the art of being a currier. In 1847, Jewell moved to Hartford where he worked for his father&#x27;s business as a currier. Jewell stopped working as a currier and became a skilled telegrapher, where he worked in New York, Ohio, and Tennessee. Jewell was a Whig who supported the election of Zachary Taylor to the office of the presidency. Having supported Taylor, Jewell moved to Mississippi where he was elected General Superintendent of Telegraphers. Jewell moved back to New York in 1849, and in 1850 he returned to his father&#x27;s tannery business having entered into partnership with his father. Between 1859 and 1860, Jewell traveled to and visited Europe on business connected with the tannery firm, having returned to the United States during the onset of the American Civil War. In 1865 Jewell returned to Europe and traveled to Egypt and the Holy Land.

Having returned to the United States, Jewell, a Republican, ran for Connecticut state senator in 1867; however, he failed to win the election. In 1868, Jewell ran for the office of Connecticut Governor; however, he lost the election. Jewell ran again the following year and was elected Governor of Connecticut in 1869, serving from 1869 until 1870, and was defeated in the 1870 election. Jewell was reelected to the governorship in 1871 and 1872, and served until 1873. In 1873, Jewell was appointed Consul to Russia by President Ulysses S. Grant and served until 1874 when he was appointed by President Grant as Postmaster General of the United States, a position he held until 1876. Jewell was also a presidential candidate at the 1876 Republican National Convention and served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1880 until 1883. Having returned to Connecticut, Jewell became a wealthy merchant, having invested in the Hartford Evening Post and the Southern New England Telephone Company. He died in 1883 in New Haven, Connecticut, and was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Early life and career==
Marshall Jewell was born in Winchester, New Hampshire on October 25, 1825. His father, Pliny Jewell, native of Hartford, was a prominent tanner and currier. His mother was Emily Alexander. His elder brother was named Harvey Jewell. The young Marshall received a limited education at common schools. At an early age Jewell apprenticed for his father in the tannery business working as a day laborer until the age of 18. Jewell moved to Woburn where he learned the skill of being a currier. Jewell returned to his father&#x27;s tannery business in Hartford where he worked in the currier shop for two years. In 1847, Jewell grew tired of the tannery business and having good business sense learned the telegraphy trade working in Boston, Rochester, and Akron. As a highly skilled telegrapher, Jewell was put in charge of the Louisville and New Orleans telegraph line working in Columbia, Tennessee.

==Early political involvement==

In 1848, while working as a telegrapher, Jewell became interested in national politics becoming a Whig. Jewell supported Zachary Taylor for President of the United States. Jewell&#x27;s political opinions would later draw him into the Republican Party formed in the mid-1850s In 1849, Jewell returned north and was elected Superintendent of the telegraph line between Boston and New York living in New York City.

==Tanning partnership established==
While Jewell was working as a telegrapher, Jewell&#x27;s father Pliny&#x27;s tanning business had increased substantially. Having left the telegraph business, moving back to Hartford, Jewell entered into partnership with his father&#x27;s tanning and belting business on January 1, 1850. Jewell, who had good business sense, for the next eight years increased his father&#x27;s business and gained a positive reputation in the Hartford community. Between 1852 and 1857 Jewell traveled widely throughout the United States to promote his manufactured leather product business.

==World travels and the American Civil War==
From 1859 to 1860, Marshall went on a trip to Europe in order to expand his leather business. During the onset of the American Civil War Jewell purchased leather putting his business in a good position to gain government contracts. During the Civil War, Jewell&#x27;s tanning business flourished having supported the Northern war effort. After the Civil War ended Jewell returned to Europe and extended his travels to Egypt and the Holy Land from 1865 to 1867.

==Governor of Connecticut==

Having returned from his extensive world travels abroad, in 1867, Jewell unsuccessfully ran for Connecticut state senator, having joined the Republican Party. In 1868, Jewell unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Connecticut. In 1869, Jewell was elected Governor of Connecticut having served until his defeat in 1870. Jewell was returned to office in the disputed election of 1871, and was last elected governor in 1872, having served three terms in office until 1873. During Jewell&#x27;s second term in office, Russian Grand Duke Alexis visited Washington, D.C., and Hartford, Connecticut. While in Hartford the Grand Duke stayed at Gov. Jewell&#x27;s house. The Grand Duke was impressed by Jewell&#x27;s ability to improve his status in the United States, having stated, &quot;What! Is this the way Americans rise? from the tannery to the governor&#x27;s chair?&quot;

==U.S. Minister to Russia==
On May 20, 1873, Ulysses S. Grant nominated Jewell as Minister to Russia, to replace James L. Orr. Jewell served with &quot;marked ability&quot; from May 29, 1873, to December 9, 1873. While Minister to Russia, a prince from the Russian nobility became infatuated with a married American woman who was visiting St. Petersburg, having given her his family&#x27;s royal diamonds. This created quite a scandal; however, Jewell investigated the matter and had the woman return the Russian diamonds to the Tsar&#x27;s family.
Jewell, who was an observant man, noticed that inferior goods not made in the United States were falsely sold on the open Russian markets under an American name. Jewell appealed to the Russian government that this practice harmed authentic American trade with Russia. Jewell was able to negotiate a specific treaty that protected United States trademarks.

While in Russia, Jewell, as a tanner, discovered that the Russians used birch tar to make the aromatic and hard-wearing Russia leather. Rather than keep this a secret for his own profit, Jewell sent a sample of the birch tar to the United States and American newspapers published how Russia leather was made. Jewell was recalled from Minister to Russia when President Grant offered Jewell the office U.S. Postmaster General. Jewell had desired to hold a domestic office rather than an international office. Jewell&#x27;s recall from Russia was a surprise to the American public, as he had served less than a year.

==U.S. Postmaster General==
In 1874, a vacancy was created in President Grant&#x27;s Cabinet when John A.J. Creswell resigned as U.S. Postmaster General. President Grant, who desired the position go to a New Englander, appointed Jewell U.S. Postmaster General in July 1874. Jewell, due to commitments as a Russian Minister and his return voyage to the United States, could not take office until August, while assistant Postmaster General, James William Marshall, served as acting U.S. Postmaster General until Jewell could take office.

===Reform efforts===
Jewell took up the office of U.S. Postmaster with vigor, a man of many words and theories, having desired to reform the Postal Service from profiteering in lucrative postal contracts known as Star Routes. Having studied the European postal system, Jewell was the first post-master to establish a direct postal route service from New York City to Chicago. Jewell wanted the Postal Service to be run like a business rather than through patronage. His ethical and progressive business practices, however, soon ran into conflict with those who wanted to the U.S. postal department to distribute patronage and lucrative contracts to brokers and mail route service providers. Jewell often called meetings with his clerks giving them new instructions on reform. Jewell was noted to have said to his clerks, &quot;We are cleaning up the department by degrees, and we are getting it found on business principles.&quot; Postmaster Jewell aided and stood by Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow shut down and prosecute the notorious Whiskey Ring; a tax evasion scheme by whiskey distillers that depleted the U.S. Treasury millions of dollars. Jewell was in favor of Bristow&#x27;s presidential aspirations in 1876.

===Resignation===
Washington, D.C., proved to be a challenge for Jewell&#x27;s reforms of the Postal Service. During his tenure partisan politics caused Jewell to lose President Grant&#x27;s support. In one instance, Jewell fired Boston postmaster, William L. Burt, for non payment of a surety bond and replaced him with Edward C. Tobey on September 18, 1875. Burt, who would not let the issue settle had several conferences with President Grant one at Long Branch in 1875 and one at Washington, D.C., in 1876 to protest his removal. Jewell stated that although Burt was a capable Postmaster of Boston, he had given Burt ample time, five months, to have paid for the surety bond. One partisan broker complained that Jewell &quot;ran the post-office as if it were a factory.&quot; Following a Cabinet meeting in 1876, President Grant abruptly asked for Sec. Jewell&#x27;s resignation without explanation. Jewell, who did not ask why Grant demanded his resignation, was shocked having believed he had the confidence of the President at the previous Cabinet meeting. President Grant, suspicious of any Cabinet members whom he was convinced were personally disloyal, believed that Jewell had been treacherous to his Administration and had conspired with another reformer, Secretary of the Treasury, Benjamin H. Bristow.

==Return to Hartford==
After Jewell had been dismissed by President Grant as Postmaster, Jewell returned to Hartford who welcomed Jewell with open arms. Jewell devoted his time to his tanning business that had faltered while he had been away. Through a series of investments in the Hartford Evening Post and the Southern New England Telephone Company Jewell became a very wealthy man.

==1876 Republican Convention==

During the 1876 Republican National Convention held in Cincinnati, Ohio, Marshall Jewell was nominated by the State of Connecticut for President of the United States. Grant chose not to run and the Republicans did not choose to nominate him for a consecutive third term. Jewell was the first person from the State of Connecticut to be nominated at a national Republican Presidential Convention. On the first presidential ballot, Jewell received 11 votes, ten from Connecticut. Jewell&#x27;s name, however, was withdrawn from the remaining ballots. Benjamin Bristow also ran for the Republican presidential candidacy, but he could not get enough votes at the end of the balloting. Although Bristow was a frontrunner and had Jewell&#x27;s support, he was considered controversial for his prosecution of the Whiskey Ring, a scandal that involved prominent Republican Party members. Instead, Rutherford B. Hayes, went on to win the Republican presidential nomination by receiving 384 votes on the seventh ballot. Jewell was also nominated for Vice President of the United States by S.H. Russell from Texas; however, William A. Wheeler was unanimously nominated on the first ballot by 366 majority votes. William Kellogg withdrew Jewell&#x27;s name from the ballot after the votes cast were unanimously for Wheeler. The state of Connecticut named Jewell on the 1876 Republican National Committee who elected Zachariah Chandler as chairman.

==Chairman of Republican Party==
In 1879 Jewell accepted the appointment of National Chairman of the Republican Party having served to 1880. During the presidential election of 1880, Jewell&#x27;s energetic approach to politics resulted in large part to the election of Republican candidate James A. Garfield to the office of President of the United States.

==Death, burial, and memorial==

Although considered a man of vitality in 1883, Jewell had contracted pneumonia that quickly took his life. When Jewell asked his doctor &quot;How long does it take for a man to die?&quot; His doctor responded, &quot;In your condition, Governor, it is a matter of only a few hours.&quot; Marshall Jewell died on February 10, 1883, in Hartford, Connecticut. Jewell was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 1883. Flags were held at half mast on public and private buildings. The Connecticut Legislature suspended business and adjourned for the day. The Governors Guard guarded Jewell&#x27;s body held in state at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church. Thousands of people viewed Jewell&#x27;s body in state and paid their respects to the former Governor. Many prominent men attended Jewell&#x27;s service, including former Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, Postmaster Timothy O. Howe, and Secretary of Navy William E. Chandler. A tall column pedestal and statue memorial monument with his family&#x27;s name, &quot;JEWELL&quot;, inscribed at the base, was placed near his burial site. Jewell&#x27;s wife, Esther E Dickerson Jewell, died February 26, 1883, and was buried next to her husband Marshall Jewell at Cedar Hill Cemetery.

His daughter was Josephine Jewell Dodge, a prominent early childhood educator and anti-suffrage activist.

<text>Aleksandrów Kujawski (until 1879: &quot;Trojanów&quot;, 1879–1919: &quot;Aleksandrów Pograniczny&quot;) is a town in north-central Poland, in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is the seat of Aleksandrów County, as well as of Gmina Aleksandrów Kujawski (although it is not part of the territory of that gmina). It is situated about south-east of Toruń. Aleksandrów Kujawski has an area of and a population of 11,536.

==History==

The Trojanów train station, which was established in the course of the construction of the railway line from Kutno to Toruń between 1859 and 1865, was the nucleus of the town, which was founded in 1862. Equally important was its location near the border of the Russian Empire (Congress Poland) with the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1879, a meeting between the Russian Emperor Alexander II and the German Emperor William I took place here. On this occasion, the place was renamed &quot;Aleksandrowo&quot; and received municipal rights. It was later renamed &quot;Aleksandrów Pograniczny&quot; (&quot;Aleksandrów on the border&quot;).

The town received its current name in 1919 after Poland was restored as an independent state. According to the 1921 census, the town had a population of 8,193, 89.3% Polish and 9.0% Jewish. In the years 1921–1923 there was an internment camp for soldiers of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in Aleksandrów Kujawski. In 1932, Aleksandrów Kujawski became the seat of the Nieszawa county, which on April 1, 1938, became part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic.

During the German occupation of Poland, between October 1939 and January 1940 Germans murdered many Poles from the town in the nearby Odolion forest (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation). In October 1939, Germans arrested five Salesians from the town, and in 1940 they expelled 735 Poles, whose houses, workshops and offices were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy.

Between 1975 and 1998 the town was a part of Włocławek Voivodeship.

==Transport==
===Road transport===
Voivodeship road 266 (Konin–Ciechocinek) directly passes through the town. The A1 motorway, which is a part of the european route E75, passes about to the east of the town.

===Rail transport===
Railway lines 18 and 245 pass through the town. The town has a railway station.

<doc id="774063" wikidata="Q121567" url="?curid=774063" title="Fisheye lens">
<text>A fisheye lens is an ultra wide-angle lens that produces strong visual distortion intended to create a wide panoramic or hemispherical image. Fisheye lenses achieve extremely wide angles of view, well beyond any rectilinear lens. Instead of producing images with straight lines of perspective (rectilinear images), fisheye lenses use a special mapping (&quot;distortion&quot;; for example: equisolid angle, see below), which gives images a characteristic convex non-rectilinear appearance.
The term &quot;fisheye&quot; was coined in 1906 by American physicist and inventor Robert W. Wood based on how a fish would see an ultrawide hemispherical view from beneath the water (a phenomenon known as Snell&#x27;s window). Their first practical use was in the 1920s for use in meteorology to study cloud formation giving them the name &quot;whole-sky lenses&quot;. The angle of view of a fisheye lens is usually between 100 and 180 degrees, although lenses covering up to 280 degrees exist (see below). Their focal lengths depend on the film format they are designed for.

Mass-produced fisheye lenses for photography first appeared in the early 1960s and are generally used for their unique, distorted appearance. For the popular 35mm film format, typical focal lengths of fisheye lenses are for circular images, and for diagonal images filling the entire frame. For digital cameras using smaller imagers such as and format CCD or CMOS sensors, the focal length of &quot;miniature&quot; fisheye lenses can be as short as .

Fisheye lenses also have other applications, such as re-projecting images originally filmed through a fisheye lens, or created via computer-generated graphics, onto hemispherical screens. They are also used for scientific photography, such as recordings of aurora and meteors, and to study plant canopy geometry, and to calculate near-ground solar radiation. In everyday life, they are perhaps most commonly encountered as peephole door viewers to give a wide field of view.

==History and development==
Panoramas with fisheye distortion predate photography and the fisheye lens. In 1779, Horace Bénédict de Saussure published his downward-facing fisheye view of the Alps: &quot;All the objects are drawn in perspective from the centre&quot;.
In 1906, Wood published a paper detailing an experiment in which he built a camera in a water-filled pail starting with a photographic plate at the bottom, a short focus lens with a pinhole diaphragm located approximately halfway up the pail, and a sheet of glass at the rim to suppress ripples in the water. The experiment was Wood&#x27;s attempt &quot;to ascertain how the external world appears to the fish&quot; and hence the title of the paper was &quot;Fish-Eye Views, and Vision under Water&quot;. Wood subsequently built an improved &quot;horizontal&quot; version of the camera omitting the lens, instead using a pinhole pierced in the side of a tank, which was filled with water and a photographic plate. In the text, he described a third &quot;Fish-Eye&quot; camera built using sheet brass, the primary advantages being that this one was more portable than the other two cameras, and was &quot;absolutely leaktight&quot;. In his conclusion, Wood thought that &quot;the device will photograph the entire sky [so] a sunshine recorder could be made on this principle, which would require no adjustment for latitude or month&quot; but also wryly noted &quot;the views used for the illustration of this paper savour somewhat of the &#x27;freak&#x27; pictures of the magazines.&quot;

W.N. Bond described an improvement to Wood&#x27;s apparatus in 1922 which replaced the tank of water with a simple hemispheric glass lens, making the camera significantly more portable. The focal length depended on the refractive index and radius of the hemispherical lens, and the maximum aperture was approximately ; it was not corrected for chromatic aberration and projected a curved field onto a flat plate. Bond noted the new lens could be used to record cloud cover or lightning strikes at a given location. Bond&#x27;s hemispheric lens also reduced the need for a pinhole aperture to ensure sharp focus, so exposure times were also reduced.

===Hill Sky Lens===

In 1924, Robin Hill first described a lens with 180° coverage that had been used for a cloud survey in September 1923 The lens, designed by Hill and R. &amp; J. Beck, Ltd., was patented in December 1923. The Hill &quot;Sky Lens&quot; is now credited as the first fisheye lens. Hill also described three different mapping functions of a lens designed to capture an entire hemisphere (stereographic, equidistant, and orthographic). Distortion is unavoidable in a lens that encompasses an angle of view exceeding 125°, but Hill and Beck claimed in the patent that stereographic or equidistant projection were the preferred mapping functions. The three-element, three-group lens design uses a highly divergent meniscus lens as the first element to bring in light over a wide view followed by a converging lens system to project the view onto a flat photographic plate.

The Hill &quot;Sky Lens&quot; was fitted to a whole sky camera, typically used in a pair separated by for stereo imaging, and equipped with a red filter for contrast; in its original form, the lens had a focal length of and cast an image in diameter at . Conrad Beck described the camera system in an article published in 1925. At least one has been reconstructed.

===German and Japanese development===

In 1932, the German firm Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft AG (AEG) filed for a patent on the &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot; (wide-angle lens), a 5-element, 4-group development of the Hill &quot;Sky Lens&quot;. Compared to the 1923 Hill &quot;Sky Lens&quot;, the 1932 &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot; featured two diverging meniscus elements ahead of the stop and used a cemented achromatic group in the converging section. Miyamoto credits Hans Schulz with the design of the &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot;. The basic patented design was produced for cloud recording as a 17 mm lens, and Umbo used the AEG lens for artistic purposes, with photographs published in a 1937 issue of &quot;Volk und Welt&quot;.

The AEG &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot; formed the basis of the later Nippon Kogaku (Nikon) &quot;Fisheye-Nikkor&quot; 16 mm lens of 1938, which was used for military and scientific (cloud cover) purposes. Nikon, which had a contract to supply optics to the Imperial Japanese Navy, possibly gained access to the AEG design under the Pact of Steel.
Also in 1938, Robert Richter of Carl Zeiss AG patented the 6-element, 5-group &quot;Pleon&quot; lens, which was used for aerial surveillance during World War II. The converging rear group of the Pleon was symmetrical, derived from the 4-element &quot;Topogon&quot; lens designed by Richter for Zeiss in 1933. Testing on a captured lens after the war showed the &quot;Pleon&quot; provided an equidistant projection to cover a field of approximately 130°, and negatives were printed using a special rectifying enlarger to eliminate distortion. The &quot;Pleon&quot; had a focal length of approximately 72.5 mm with a maximum aperture of and used a plano-concave front element in diameter; the image on the negative was approximately in diameter.
===35 mm development===

At approximately the same time that Schulz was developing the &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot; at AEG, at Zeiss was developing the &quot;Sphaerogon&quot;, which was also designed to encompass a 180° field of view. Unlike the &quot;Weitwinkelobjektiv&quot;, Merté&#x27;s &quot;Sphaerogon&quot; was not limited to medium format cameras; prototype versions of the &quot;Sphaerogon&quot; were constructed for the Contax I miniature format camera. The first prototype &quot;Sphaerogon&quot; lenses constructed had a maximum aperture of , but later examples were computed half a stop faster, to . Several prototype examples of &quot;Sphaerogon&quot; lenses were recovered as part of the Zeiss Lens Collection seized by the Army Signal Corps as war reparations in 1945; the collection, which the Zeiss firm had retained as a record of their designs, was later documented by Merté, the former head of optical computation for CZJ, working under Signal Corps officer Edward Kaprelian.

After the war, the &quot;Fisheye-Nikkor&quot; lens was mated to a medium format camera and was produced in slightly modified form (focal length increased slightly to 16.3 mm) as the &quot;Sky-image Recording Camera&quot; in March 1957 for the Japanese government, followed by a commercial release as the Nikon Fisheye Camera (also known as the &quot;Nikon Sky Camera&quot; or &quot;Nikon Cloud Camera&quot;) in September 1960, which had a retail price of . The revised lens created a circular image in diameter and covered a complete hemispherical field of 180°. Only 30 examples of the Nikon Fisheye Camera were manufactured, and of those, 18 were sold to customers, mainly in the United States; Nikon likely destroyed the remaining stock to avoid tax penalties. Photographs taken with the Fisheye Camera that were published in &quot;Life&quot; in 1957 marked the first wide exposure of the public to fisheye distortion; including a photograph of the United States Senate caucus room, taken by Ed Clark and published in an April 1957 issue, and a photograph of pole vaulter Bob Gutowski taken by Ralph Crane, published in July 1957.
The Nikon Fisheye Camera was discontinued in September 1961, and Nikon subsequently introduced the first regular production fisheye lens for 35 mm cameras in 1962, the &quot;Fisheye-Nikkor&quot; 8 mm , which required the reflex mirror on its Nikon F and Nikkormat cameras to be locked up prior to mounting the lens. Prior to the early 1960s, fisheye lenses were used primarily by professional and scientific photographers, but the advent of the fisheye for the 35 mm format increased its popular use. The &quot;Fisheye-Nikkor&quot; 8 mm has a field of view of 180° and uses 9 elements in 5 groups; it has a fixed focus and built-in filters intended for black-and-white photography. Research indicates that fewer than 1,400 lenses were built. As fisheye lenses became more widely available, the distinctive distortion grew in popularity, especially for album covers. For example, British fashion photographer Tim Walker used a fisheye lens to capture the cover of Harry Styles&#x27; 2019 pop/rock album, &quot;Fine Line&quot;. Other genres that have taken advantage of the fisheye lens look include punk rock, hip-hop, and skateboarding videos. In particular, the fisheye lens became a signature style of music video director Hype Williams, especially in the mid-to-late 1990s when he directed videos for artists such as Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott, and Puff Daddy.
Nikon subsequently released several more milestone circular fisheye lenses in Nikon F mount through the 1960s and 70s:
* 10 mm OP (1968), the first fisheye to feature orthographic projection, which was also the first lens to feature an aspherical element
* 6 mm (1969), the first fisheye to feature a 220° field of view; the patent accompanying this lens includes a design for a lens with a 270° field of view. A 6.2 mm SAP fisheye was later produced in limited numbers with an aspherical surface, encompassing a 230° field of view.
* 8 mm (1970), the first circular fisheye with variable focus, automatic aperture, and reflex viewing (mirror lock-up no longer required).
Contemporaneously, other Japanese manufacturers were developing the so-called &quot;full-frame&quot; or diagonal fisheyes, which captured approximately a 180° field of view across the diagonal of the film frame. The first such diagonal fisheye was the &quot;Fish-eye Takumar&quot; 18 mm , released by Pentax (Asahi Optical) in 1962, followed by the slightly faster &quot;UW Rokkor-PG&quot; 18 mm from Minolta in 1966. Both of these were reflex-viewing and fixed-focus. Both Pentax and Minolta followed up with faster lenses with variable focus in 1967 (&quot;Super Fish-eye-Takumar&quot; 17 mm ) and 1969 (&quot;Rokkor-OK&quot; 16 mm), respectively. The 16 mm Rokkor was later adopted by Leica as the &quot;Fisheye-Elmarit-R&quot; (1974) for its SLRs and then converted to autofocus (1986) for the Alpha system. , the same basic optical design is still sold as the Sony SAL16F28.
==Design==
Unlike rectilinear lenses, fisheye lenses are not fully characterised by focal length and aperture alone. Angle of view, image diameter, projection type, and sensor coverage all vary independently of these.

=== Image diameter and coverage ===
In a circular fisheye lens, the image circle is &quot;inscribed in&quot; the film or sensor area; in a diagonal (&quot;full-frame&quot;) fisheye lens, the image circle is &quot;circumscribed around&quot; the film or sensor area. This implies that using a fisheye lens for a different format than it was intended for is easy (as opposed to a rectilinear lens), and may change its characteristic.

Further, different fisheye lenses map (&quot;distort&quot;) images differently, and the manner of distortion is referred to as their mapping function. A common type for consumer use is &quot;equisolid angle.&quot;

Although there are digital fisheye effects available both in-camera and as computer software, neither can extend the angle of view of the original images to the very large one of a true fisheye lens.

===Focal length===
The focal length is determined by the angular coverage, the specific mapping function used, and the required dimensions of the final image. Focal lengths for popular amateur camera sizes are computed as:

;Notes
===Circular fisheyes===
The first types of fisheye lenses developed were &quot;circular&quot; — lenses which took in a 180° hemisphere and projected it as a circle within the film frame. By design, circular fisheye lenses thus cover a smaller image circle than rectilinear lenses designed for the same sensor size. The corners of a circular fisheye image will be completely black. This blackness is different from the gradual vignetting of rectilinear lenses and sets on abruptly.

Some circular fisheyes were available in orthographic projection models for scientific applications. These have a 180° &quot;vertical,&quot; horizontal and diagonal angle of view. 

For APS and m43 cameras, several lenses have emerged that retain a 180° field of view on a crop body. The first of these was the Sigma 4.5mm. Sunex also makes a 5.6mm fisheye lens that captures a circular 185° field of view on a 1.5x Nikon and 1.6x Canon DSLR cameras.

Nikon produced a 6 mm circular fisheye lens for 35 mm film that was initially designed for an expedition to Antarctica. It featured a 220° field of view, designed to capture the entire sky and surrounding ground when pointed straight up. This lens is no longer manufactured, and is used nowadays to produce interactive virtual-reality images such as QuickTime VR and IPIX. Because of its very wide field of view, it is very large — weighing , having a diameter of , a length of and an angle of view of 220 degrees. It dwarfs a regular 35 mm SLR camera and has its own tripod mounting point, a feature normally seen in large long-focus or telephoto lenses to reduce strain on the lens mount. The lens is extremely rare.

More recently, the Japanese manufacturer Entaniya offers several fisheye lenses with angles of view up to 250° on 35 mm full frame, and up to 280° on smaller sensors (see list below). In 2018, Venus Optics introduced a 210° fisheye lens for the Micro Four Thirds system.

The 8 mm and 7.5 mm circular fisheye lenses made by Nikon have proven useful for scientific purposes because of their equidistant (equiangular) projection, in which distance along the radius of the circular image is proportional to the zenith angle.

=== Diagonal fisheyes (a.k.a. full-frame or rectangular) ===
As fisheye lenses gained popularity in general photography, camera companies began manufacturing fisheye lenses with an enlarged image circle to cover the entire rectangular film frame. They are called diagonal, or sometimes &quot;rectangular&quot; or &quot;full-frame&quot;, fisheyes. (This was well before digital photography, so the use of the term &quot;full frame&quot; with respect to fisheyes has nothing to do with the use of the term to designate a digital sensor measuring 36x24 mm).

The angle of view produced by diagonal fisheyes only measures 180° &quot;from corner to corner&quot;: they have a 180° &quot;diagonal&quot; angle of view (AOV), while the horizontal and vertical angles of view will be smaller. For an equisolid angle 15 mm full-frame fisheye, the horizontal AOV will be 147°, and the vertical AOV will be 94°.

One of the first diagonal fisheye lenses to be mass-produced was the Nikon Fisheye-Nikkor F 16mm , made in the early 1970s. 

To obtain the same effect on digital cameras with smaller sensors, shorter focal lengths are required. Nikon makes a 10.5 mm fisheye for their APS DX SLRs. Several other companies make &quot;full frame&quot;, i.e. diagonal, fisheyes for APS and m43 cameras, see next paragraph.

=== Portrait or cropped-circle fisheyes ===
An intermediate between a diagonal and a circular fisheye consists of a circular image optimised for the &quot;width&quot; of the film format rather than the &quot;height&quot;. As a result, on any non-square film format, the circular image will be cropped at the top and bottom, but still show black edges on the left and right. This format is called a &quot;portrait&quot; fisheye; historically, it has been rather rareonly the 12 mm Accura lens (see list below) directly follows the portrait principle. Today however, a portrait fisheye effect is easily achieved by using a fisheye lens intended for full coverage of a smaller sensor format, like an APS diagonal fisheye on a 35 mm full frame camera, or an m43 diagonal fisheye on APS. 

===Miniature fisheye lenses===
Miniature digital cameras, especially when used as security cameras, often tend to have fisheye lenses to maximize coverage. Miniature fisheye lenses are designed for small-format CCD/CMOS imagers commonly used in consumer and security cameras. Popular image sensor format sizes used include &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;. Depending on the active area of the image sensor, the same lens can form a circular image on a larger image sensor (e.g. &quot;), and a full frame on a smaller one (e.g. &quot;).

==Examples and specific models==
For a comprehensive list of all current and all past fisheye lenses, see External Links below. 

===Noteworthy fisheye lenses for APS-C cameras===
The APS-C image sensor used in Canon cameras is , or on the diagonal, which is slightly smaller than the sensor size used by other popular manufacturers of cameras with APS-C sensors, such as Fuji, Minolta, Nikon, Pentax, and Sony. The other common APS-C sensors range from on the long dimension and on the shorter side, for a diagonal between .

====Full-frame (i.e. diagonal) fisheye lenses====
* Canon EF 15 mm (optically simpler successor of the below FD model; since discontinued)
* Canon Fisheye FD 15 mm (predecessor of the above, incompatible with EF mount. Two versions: original with silver bayonet ring, 1973; NewFD with black bayonet ring, 1980. Both have inbuilt colour filters and S.S.C. coating)

====Zoom fisheye lenses====
*Canon EF 8–15mm L Fisheye USM180° at all focal lengths, but turning from a circular to a diagonal fisheye on a 35 mm full-frame camera, i.e. changing in vertical angle of view. On a crop camera with APS-C/H size sensors, it only yields a cropped circular and full-frame image. A zoom lock is included which avoids leaving the focal length range of full coverage on crop sensor cameras.
* Nikon AF-S Fisheye Nikkor 8–15mm E EDdesigned for full-frame and FX cameras, this lens behaves identically to the Canon.
* Tokina AT-X AF DX = Pentax DA ED IF 10–17 mm a fisheye zoom lens designed for APS-C sensor cameras, also sold as an NH version without integrated lens hood: then, it is usable on full frame cameras.
* Pentax F 17–28mm FisheyeThis lens was born for 35 mm full frame film cameras, to take the place of the 16mm f/2.8 in the AF era. It starts from a 17mm full-frame (diagonal) fisheye. When it reaches 28mm, the fisheye effect is almost gone, leaving an overdistorted wideangle image. It was intended as a &quot;special effect&quot; lens and is claimed not to have sold too many copies.

==== Curiosities ====

* Canon 5.2 mm f/2.8 RF L (a 190° stereographic fisheye with &quot;two&quot; fisheye lens systems: for 3D virtual reality shooting onto a single 35 mm full-frame image sensor, and less relevant for photography: fitting two image circles onto one frame of 36 mm width means that each can only be 18 mm in diameter, wasting quite a bit of resolution)
* Pentax K &quot;Bird&#x27;s eye&quot; 8.4 mm (prototype, 1982, rendition not quite the same as a fisheye)

==Sample images==
==Other applications==
* Many planetariums now use fisheye projection lenses to project the night sky or other digital content onto the interior of a dome.
* Fish-eye lenses are used in POV pornography to make things right in front of the camera look bigger.
* Flight simulators and visual combat simulators use fisheye projection lenses in order to create an immersive environment for pilots, air traffic controllers, or military personnel to train in.
* Similarly, the IMAX Dome (previously &#x27;OMNIMAX&#x27;) motion-picture format involves photography through a circular fisheye lens, and projection through the same onto a hemispherical screen.
* Scientists and resource managers (e.g., biologists, foresters, and meteorologists) use fisheye lenses for hemispherical photography to calculate plant canopy indices and near-ground solar radiation. Applications include evaluation of forest health, characterization of monarch butterfly winter roosting sites, and management of vineyards.
* Astronomers use fisheye lenses to capture cloud cover and light pollution data.
* Photographers and videographers use fisheye lenses so they can get the camera as close as possible for action shots whilst also capturing context, for example in skateboarding to focus on the board and still retain an image of the skater.
* The &quot;eye&quot; of the HAL 9000 computer from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was constructed using a Fisheye-Nikkor 8 mm lens. HAL&#x27;s point-of-view was filmed using a Fairchild-Curtis &#x27;bug-eye&#x27; lens originally designed for films in the Cinerama 360 dome format.
* The first music video to be shot completely with fisheye lens was for the Beastie Boys song &quot;Hold It Now, Hit It&quot; in 1987.
* In Computer Graphics, circular fisheye images can be used to create environment maps from the physical world. One complete 180-degree wide angle fisheye image will fit to half of cubic mapping space using the proper algorithm. Environment maps can be used to render 3D objects and virtual panoramic scenes.
* Many personal weather station online cameras around the world upload fisheye images of the current local sky conditions as well as a previous day time-lapse sequence with climate conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind and rainfall amounts.
* In door&#x27;s peepholes, to allow the viewer inside to see a wider view from the outside.

==Mapping function==
The subject is placed in the image by the lens according to the &quot;mapping function&quot; of the lens. The mapping function gives , the position of the object from the center of the image, as a function of , the focal length, and , the angle from the optical axis, in radians.


Other mapping functions (for example Panomorph Lenses) are also possible for enhancing the off-axis resolution of fisheye lenses.

With appropriate software, the curvilinear images produced by a fisheye lens can be remapped to a conventional rectilinear projection. Although this entails some loss of detail at the edges of the frame, the technique can produce an image with a field of view greater than that of a conventional rectilinear lens. This is particularly useful for creating panoramic images.

All types of fisheye lenses bend straight lines. Aperture angles of 180° or more are possible only with large amounts of barrel distortion.

<text>Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra (November 15, 1846 – May 9, 1919) was a Dominican Republic political figure. He served as the president of the Dominican Republic between 15 November 1899 and 2 May 1902, and again between 5 December 1914 and 7 May 1916.

Jimenes was one of the main leaders of the Los Bolos, Blue party or Jimenistas, opposed to the Los Coludos or Horacistas, led by Horacio Vásquez.

He was married to Josefa de los Santos Domínguez. Los Santos spoke French and read poetry and spiritual books.

He is buried in the Catedral de Santa María la Menor.

==Early life==
He was born on November 15, 1846 in Santo Domingo. He belonged to a family of the Dominican financial oligarchy; his father was Manuel Jiménes, second president of the Dominican Republic, and Altagracia Pereyra.

He settled at an early age in Monte Cristi, where he devoted himself to commerce and made a considerable fortune. His business house had branches in the main ports of the country and in some European cities.

==Early political career==
He entered politics in 1873, when he went to the mountains to fight against Buenaventura Báez in the Six Years&#x27; War. Committed to the liberals, his open opposition to the regime of President Ulises Heureaux led him to exile and to undertake an attempt at an armed invasion of the country in 1872.

He became an expatriate and settled in France, returning to Santo Domingo after the murder of Heureaux in 1899.

==First presidential term==
His reputation as a financier helped him to become president with the support of the military who had taken part in the conspiracy against the previous president. They appointed General Horacio Vásquez as vice president. He was implicated in the murder of Heureaux and Jimenes had a tense relationship with him. The opposition between the two polarized the political life of the country, which was divided between Jimenistas and Horacistas (also called bolos and colúos, respectively, using the jargon of the popular cockfights).

Jimenes inherited the exorbitant foreign debt accumulated during his predecessor&#x27;s term of office, the total amount of which had been kept hidden until then. The country&#x27;s financial situation was catastrophic: customs revenues were in the hands of foreign capital and administrators, who controlled a large part of the treasury&#x27;s resources.

In an attempt to reestablish government control over financial administration, Jimenes abolished export taxes and decreed the expulsion of foreign personnel who controlled customs. He negotiated directly with the country&#x27;s European and American creditors. With the former he managed to reach an agreement on the debt, but with the United States (represented by the powerful Santo Domingo Improvement Company) all his efforts were in vain. At the same time, the country suffered continuous revolts and military uprisings.

In April 1902 he was deposed by a movement led by Vice President Horacio Vásquez. The following year, after Vásquez&#x27;s fall, he tried to retake the government, but the Lilisistas got ahead of him and Alejandro Woss y Gil took power.

==Second presidential term==
He was re-elected in 1914, after elections controlled by Washington. During his second term, he faced continued American interference in Dominican affairs. Woodrow Wilson &#x27;s administration sought to place the country&#x27;s economic resources and security forces under Washington &#x27;s direct control.

On April 15, 1916, U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan ordered the invasion of the Dominican Republic. U.S. Marines occupied the country&#x27;s main cities and took over customs offices.

Jimenes&#x27;s authority was called into question when the foreign occupation took place and, in May 1916, the nation&#x27;s Congress voted in favor of the uprising of the Minister of War, General Desiderio Arias. As a result, Jimenes was forced to resign.

He was replaced as president by Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal.

==Death==
He died in Santo Domingo on May 9, 1919, at the age of 72.

<text>Ricardo Jiménez was a Puerto Rican member of the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña who was sentenced to 90 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was sentenced on February 18, 1981, and incarcerated in a U.S. federal prison. However, he was released early from prison, after President Bill Clinton extended a clemency offer to him on September 7, 1999.

==Early years and personal life==
Jiménez was born in Puerto Rico in 1956. His family moved to the U.S. when he was still an infant. He attended Tuley High School in Chicago when the school was in the midst of a crisis brought about by the lack of a relevant curriculum for Puerto Rican students. As a member of Aspira and the student council he was a leader in struggles which ultimately led to the creation of the Roberto Clemente High School. Jiménez was also Vice President of the Senior Class, a member of the national Honor Society and in 1974 was chosen by the mayor as the city of Chicago&#x27;s Senior High School Student of the Year.

In his community Jiménez worked as a volunteer at El Rancor, a drug rehabilitation center, and on a project on housing which led to the exposure of a plan called the Chicago 21 plan, to turn the Puerto Rican community into an enclave for the high income professional class. Upon graduation he attended Loyola University and was a member of the Latin American Student Organization, which developed the university&#x27;s first Puerto Rican history class. He later attended Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and was selected to represent the student body in a national conference on the need to force large U.S. corporations to open their doors to Latino engineers and other high tech professionals.

==Seditious conspiracy==
Jiménez and 11 others were arrested on April 4, 1980, in Evanston, Illinois. They had been linked to more than 100 bombings or attempted bombings since 1974 in their attempt to achieve independence for Puerto Rico. At their trial proceedings, some of the arrested declared their status as prisoners of war, and refused to participate in the proceedings.

None of the bombings of which they were convicted resulted in deaths or injuries. Jimenez was given a 90-year federal sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Among the other convicted Puerto Rican nationalists there were sentences of as long as 90 years in Federal prisons for offenses including sedition, possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a crime. None of those granted clemency were convicted in any of the actual bombings. Rather, they had been convicted on a variety of charges ranging from bomb making and conspiracy to armed robbery and firearms violations. They were all convicted for sedition, the act of attempting to overthrow the Government of the United States in Puerto Rico by force.

In prison, Jimenez gravitated to educational programs, both as a student and as a tutor for other students. He volunteered teaching illiterate and functionally illiterate prisoners to read and write.

==Human rights violations==
There were reports of human rights violations against the FALN prisoners. The prisoners were placed in prisons far from their families, some were sexually assaulted by prison personnel, some were denied adequate medical attention, and others were kept in isolated underground prison cells for no reason. Amnesty International and the House of Representatives&#x27; Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Administration of Justice both criticized the conditions. The conditions were found to be in violation of the &quot;U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners&quot;. A federal judge also expressed concerns regarding FALN prisoners held at the Female High Security Unit, Lexington, Kentucky. In the case of &quot;Baraldini vs. Meese&quot;, the judge found that their exceptionally restrictive conditions of detention were not in response to any legitimate security threat, and were therefore &quot;an exaggerated response&quot; and in violation of the prisoners&#x27; First Amendment rights.

==Political prisoner==
At the time of their arrest Jimenez and the others declared themselves to be combatants in an anti-colonial war against the United States to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S. domination and invoked prisoner of war status. They argued that the U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be handed over to an international court that would determine their status. The U.S. Government, however, did not recognize their request.

The sentences received by Jimenez and the other Nationalists were judged to be &quot;out of proportion to the nationalists&#x27; offenses.&quot; Statistics showed their sentences were almost 20 times greater than sentences for similar offenses by the American population at large.

For many years, numerous national and international organizations criticized Jimenez&#x27;s incarceration categorizing it as political imprisonment.
 Jiménez was finally released from prison on September 10, 1999, after President Bill Clinton extended him clemency. Clinton cited Rev. Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter as having been influential on his decision to grant Jimenez the clemency offer. Cases involving the release of other Puerto Rican Nationalist prisoners have also been categorized as cases of political prisoners, with some being more vocal than others.

In criticizing President Clinton&#x27;s decision to release the Puerto Rican prisoners, the conservative U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee also categorized Jimenez as a &quot;Puerto Rican Nationalist&quot;, echoing a recent &quot;Newsweek&quot; article. In 2006, the United Nations called for the release of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners in United States prisons.

==HIV/AIDS activism==
As of 2011, Jiménez lives in Chicago and works as an HIV/AIDS counselor for the Latino HIV/AIDS support agency, Vida/SIDA, a project of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He is also active in the movement for funding of HIV intervention/prevention for the Latino community and for LGBTQ (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/queer) rights. Jiménez is currently an openly gay man, as he has discussed in a radio interview.

<text>Joanna is a feminine given name deriving from from . Variants in English include Joan, Joann, Joanne, and Johanna. Other forms of the name in English are Jan, Jane, Janet, Janice, Jean, and Jeanne.

The earliest recorded occurrence of the name Joanna, in Luke 8:3, refers to the disciple &quot;Joanna the wife of Chuza,&quot; who was an associate of Mary Magdalene. Her name as given is Greek in form, although it ultimately originated from the Hebrew masculine name יְהוֹחָנָן &quot;Yəhôḥānān&quot; or יוֹחָנָן &quot;Yôḥānān&quot; meaning &#x27;God is gracious&#x27;. In Greek this name became Ιωαννης &quot;Iōannēs&quot;, from which &quot;Iōanna&quot; was derived by giving it a feminine ending. The name Joanna, like Yehohanan, was associated with Hasmonean families. Saint Joanna was culturally Hellenized, thus bearing the Grecian adaptation of a Jewish name, as was commonly done in her milieu.

At the beginning of the Christian era, the names Iōanna and Iōannēs were already common in Judea. The name &quot;Joanna&quot; and its equivalents became popular for women &quot;all at once&quot; beginning in the 12th century in Navarre and the south of France. In England, the name did not become current until the 19th century.

The original Latin form &quot;Joanna&quot; was used in English to translate the equivalents in other languages; for example, Juana la Loca is known in English as Joanna the Mad. The variant form &quot;Johanna&quot; originated in Latin in the Middle Ages, by analogy with the Latin masculine name &quot;Johannes&quot;. The Greek form lacks a medial &quot;-h-&quot; because in Greek /h/ could only occur initially.

The Hebrew name יוֹחָנָה &quot;Yôḥānāh&quot; forms a feminine equivalent in Hebrew for the name Joanna and its variants. The Christian Arabic form of John is يوحنّا &quot;Yūḥannā&quot;, based on the Judeo-Aramaic form of the name. For Joanna, Arabic translations of the Bible use يونّا &quot;Yuwannā&quot; based on Syriac ܝܘܚܢ &quot;Yoanna&quot;, which in turn is based on the Greek form &quot;Iōanna&quot;.

Sometimes in modern English &quot;Joanna&quot; is reinterpreted as a compound of the two names Jo and Anna, and therefore given a spelling like JoAnna, Jo-Anna, or Jo Anna. However, the original name Joanna is a single unit, not a compound. The names Hannah, Anna, Anne, Ann are etymologically related to Joanna just the same: they are derived from Hebrew חַנָּה &quot;Ḥannāh&quot; &#x27;grace&#x27; from the same verbal root meaning &#x27;to be gracious&#x27;.

<text>Matthías Jochumsson (11 November 1835 – 18 November 1920) was an Icelandic Lutheran clergyman, poet, playwright, and translator. He is best known for his lyrical poetry and for writing the national anthem of Iceland, &quot;Lofsöngur&quot;, in 1874. 

==Life==
He was born in Skógar in Þorskafjörður, western Iceland, into a poor family. He studied theology, was ordained priest and for a number of years served as pastor at Oddi, S Iceland, and later in Akureyri. He also worked as a newspaper editor and schoolteacher. In his religious views, Matthías leaned towards Unitarianism. Matthías made some trips to the continent to further his education.

Intending to become a businessman, Matthías discovered his passion for languages and literature. In addition to his own works, which include many hymns, Matthías was a prolific translator, especially from English and the Scandinavian languages. His translations from Shakespeare include Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello and Romeo and Juliet. 

Matthías&#x27;s popular comedy, &quot;Skugga-Sveinn&quot;, which premiered in 1860, is often hailed as Iceland&#x27;s first successful performed play.

He wrote &quot;Lofsöngur&quot; with music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1874.

He died in Akureyri, where his house, , is now a museum, devoted to his life and work. He is buried in Akureyri.

<doc id="774095" wikidata="Q603233" url="?curid=774095" title="Julius Asclepiodotus">
<text>Julius Asclepiodotus was a Roman praetorian prefect who, according to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, served under the emperors Aurelian, Probus and Diocletian, and was consul in 292. In 296, he assisted the western Caesar Constantius Chlorus in re-establishing Roman rule in Britain, following the illegal rules of Carausius and Allectus.

==Historical Life==
Allectus, having assassinated Carausius in 293, remained in control of Britain until 296, when Constantius staged an invasion to retake the island. While Constantius sailed from Boulogne, Asclepiodotus took a section of the fleet and the legions from San Dun Sandouville and the oppidum near Le Havre, slipping past Allectus&#x27;s fleet at the Isle of Wight under cover of fog, and landed presumably in the vicinity of Southampton or Chichester, where he burned his ships. Allectus attempted to retreat from the coast, but was cut off by Constantius&#x27;s forces and defeated. Some of Constantius&#x27;s troops, who had been separated from the main body by the fog during the channel crossing, caught up with the remnants of Allectus&#x27;s men at London and massacred them.

He may be the same Asclepiodotus as the one who wrote a biography of Diocletian.

==In legend==
Asclepiodotus appears in medieval British legend as a native king of Britain. Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136) portrays him as a duke of Cornwall who is raised to the kingship in opposition to Allectus, a Roman who oppressed the people of Britain. He defeats and kills Allectus near London, and besieges the rest of his forces in the city. The Romans eventually surrender on condition of safe conduct out of Britain, which Asclepiodotus is willing to grant, but his allies the Venedoti attack them and cut off their heads, which are thrown into the river Gallobroc. Asclepiodotus is then officially crowned king, and rules justly for ten years. However, his rule is contemporary with the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian, and Geoffrey places the martyrdom of Saint Alban at this time. In response to these atrocities, Coel, duke of Colchester, leads a revolt against him, kills him, and takes his crown.

<doc id="774100" wikidata="Q320989" url="?curid=774100" title="Johan Sverkersson">
<text>Johan Sverkersson ( – 10 March 1222), also known as John I, was King of Sweden from 1216 until his death in 1222. He was the last king from the House of Sverker, leaving no heirs. During his reign, an expedition was launched from Sweden against the Estonians, with disastrous results.

==Background==
Johan was the son of King Sverker II of Sweden of the House of Sverker and Queen Ingegerd of the Bjälbo dynasty. When he was one year old, his maternal grandfather Jarl Birger Brosa died. King Sverker appointed his son as nominal jarl in order to strengthen his own ruling powers and secure the increasingly important jarl institution. This enraged the rival House of Erik as well as some of Birger Brosa&#x27;s offspring, and Johan was contemptuously known as the &quot;breech-less jarl&quot;. Johan retained his dignity until his father King Sverker was beaten in the Battle of Lena in 1208 and exiled to Denmark, while his rival Erik Knutsson, from the House of Erik, became King of Sweden. Sverker II tried to recapture the throne, but was killed in the Battle of Gestilren in 1210.

==Reign==
When King Erik Knutsson died suddenly in fever in 1216, the teen-aged Johan was hailed king by the Swedish aristocracy against the will of the Pope in Rome. The Danish King Valdemar Sejr also opposed the choice, since the posthumous son of Erik Knutsson was a nephew of his. In Sweden itself the succession did not take place without strife. The Church had a big stake in the appointment, and it is apparent that Johan had a number of church leaders at his side, including Archbishop Valerius, Bishop Bengt of Skara and Bishop Karl of Linköping. The last-mentioned was termed chancellor; this is the first time that the title occurs in Sweden. The young ruler was crowned in 1219 and immediately issued a charter of privileges to the Swedish bishops. The charter confirmed the privileges that his father Sverker II had issued in 1200, but expanded them. The properties of the church were to be free from royal revenue demands, and fines paid by tenants of the Church would go to the bishops. He also granted several royal farms to various clergymen.

==Expedition to Estonia==
During the brief reign of King Johan, a Swedish presence was established in Estonia. The background to this is the activities of the German Order of the Sword Brothers and the Danish King Valdemar Sejr in the still pagan Baltic region. The Swedish aristocracy wished to share the spoils, and an expedition was equipped. King Johan himself, his cousin, Jarl Karl Döve (the brother of Birger Brosa), and his chancellor, Bishop Karl Magnusson led the fleet to Rotalia in Estonia in 1220. The enterprise was initially successful and King Johan established a base in Leal (Lihula). From this stronghold the Swedish soldiers made forays to the countryside, built churches and forced the locals to accept baptism. The king then returned home. However, the expedition ended in disaster. The inhabitants of Ösel assaulted the Swedish base in the Battle of Lihula on 8 August 1220. Bishop Karl and Jarl Karl Döve fell together with almost all the Swedish defenders. The devastating defeat left no Swedish presence and discouraged the Swedish expansion to Estonia for more than 300 years. The events were described in the &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; and the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot;.

==Death and succession==
King Johan remained on the throne until his death on 10 March 1222. He died unmarried and childless, and left a favourable memory in Swedish historiography: &quot;He was young of years and very gentle. He was king for three winters and died of illness on Visingsö. All of Sweden deeply mourned his death, that he was not allowed a longer life. And he rests in Alvastra, and God may preserve his soul in eternity&quot;. In the same year 1222, the rival dynasty&#x27;s young heir Erik Eriksson ascended the throne at the age of 6.

<doc id="774104" wikidata="Q6242326" url="?curid=774104" title="John Jumper (Seminole chief)">
<text>John Jumper (c.1820 – September 21, 1896) or Heneha Mekko, was Principal Chief of the Seminole Nation from 1849 to 1865, and again from 1882 to 1885. He was also a Baptist pastor. Jumper led those Seminole who supported the Confederacy, signing a treaty with the new government in the hope of gaining an Indian state if they were successful. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army Seminole Mounted Volunteers.

==First chieftainship==
Jumper fought against the United States in the Second Seminole War (1835 -1842), and was sent to Indian Territory after his capture. He was born into a prominent Seminole family, as his uncle was Micanopy, the leading chief of the Seminole tribe, and his father was Ote Emathla, a trusted advisor and brother-in-law of Micanopy and an important Seminole leader in his own right. Jumper became principal chief of the Seminoles after the death of his brother, James Jumper, in 1849. In 1850, he led a delegation to Florida to encourage the remaining Seminoles to move to Indian Territory also. As chief, he oversaw the establishment of the Seminole Nation in Indian Territory in 1856. He also supported the establishment of schools for his people by Presbyterian ministers.

==Civil War service==
When the Civil War broke out, Chief Jumper reluctantly agreed to sign an alliance with the Confederate States of America. He also enlisted in the Confederate Army, first serving as a major in the First Battalion Seminole Mounted Rifles, and as lieutenant colonel of the First Regiment Seminole Volunteers. He led these troops in the battles of Round Mountain, Chusto-Talasah, Middle Boggy, and Second Cabin Creek.

==Post Civil War==
After the Civil War, Jumper was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1865. He served as pastor of the Spring Baptist Church near the community of Sasakwa in the Seminole Nation, Indian Territory, and remained as pastor there until 1894.

Because of the Seminole alliance with the Confederacy, the United States forced the tribe to sign a new peace treaty after the war. They were required to emancipate their slaves, and to offer those freedmen who wanted to stay in Indian Territory full citizenship in the tribe.

John Jumper represented the Southern Seminoles at the Fort Smith Council of 1865, where the U.S. Government recognized Union loyalist John Chupko as the Principal Chief of the Seminole Nation. Jumper was elected Principal Chief in 1882, and was succeeded by his son-in-law, John F. Brown in 1885.

==Death==
John Jumper died at his home near Wewoka, Indian Territory on September 21, 1896.

<doc id="774105" wikidata="Q310528" url="?curid=774105" title="Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein">
<text>Johann I Joseph (&quot;Johann Baptist Josef Adam Johann Nepomuk Aloys Franz de Paula&quot;; 26 June 1760 – 20 April 1836) was Prince of Liechtenstein between 1805 and 1806 and again from 1814 until 1836. He was the last Liechtenstein prince to rule under the Holy Roman Empire between 1805 and 1806 and as regent of Liechtenstein from 1806 until 1814. He was the fourth son of Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein.

In the year 1785 Johann joined the Freemason lodge in Vienna. 

==Early career==

Johann chose a military career and at age 21 entered the army as a lieutenant in a cuirassier regiment. During the Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791) he earned, in rapid succession, promotion to Major, Oberstleutnant, and Oberst (colonel). He earned renown as a good cavalry officer and was honored with the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1790.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

During the French Revolutionary Wars, he participated in an &quot;outstandingly effective cavalry action&quot; at Avesnes-le-Sec on 12 September 1793, where 4,663 Republican troops suffered losses of 2,000 killed and wounded with the Allies losing only 69 men. In addition, 2,000 soldiers and 20 artillery pieces were captured. He also participated in many other battles. Soon after being promoted to General-Major in June 1794, he fought at the Battle of Fleurus. He commanded a mixed cavalry-infantry brigade in Anton Sztaray&#x27;s division at the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. After this action he was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa.

In the War of the Second Coalition, Liechtenstein commanded the Austrian Reserve at the Battle of Trebbia. In August 1799 he received promotion to Feldmarschal-Leutnant. He commanded 8,000 men in the successful siege of Cuneo in November and December. On 3 December 1800, he led a 5,109-man cavalry division in the Battle of Hohenlinden.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Liechtenstein was prominent in the Napoleonic Wars. At the Battle of Austerlitz, he led the 4,600 cavalry of the 5th Column. His troops fought well but he was unable to save the Austrian-Russian army from a disastrous defeat. Afterward, he carried on the negotiations with Emperor Napoleon I which concluded with the Peace of Pressburg. He earned the rank of General of Cavalry in 1808.

Throughout the War of the Fifth Coalition Liechtenstein commanded the I Reserve Korps in the army of Archduke Charles. He led his cavalry and grenadiers at the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April 1809, the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21–22 May, and the Battle of Wagram on 5–6 July. He took command of the main army after Archduke Charles resigned and held this responsibility until the end of the year. Emperor Francis II promoted him Feldmarschall in September. He negotiated and signed the Peace of Schönbrunn. Both of these treaties were very favourable to Napoleon and hard on Austria. Afterward, Liechtenstein was accused of having little diplomatic skill. To escape criticism he resigned from the military in 1810.

==Sovereign==

As Prince of Liechtenstein, Johann made forward-thinking reforms, but also had an absolutist governing style. In 1818 he granted a constitution, although it was limited in its nature. He expanded agriculture and forestry and radically reorganized his administration, in an attempt to take the requirements of what was then a modern estate into account.

He proved a trendsetter in the area of garden art by planting Biedermeier gardens and park landscapes in an English model.

In 1806 Napoleon incorporated Liechtenstein in the Confederation of the Rhine and made it a sovereign state. At the Vienna Congress the sovereignty of Liechtenstein was approved. Liechtenstein became a member of the German Confederation in 1815. This membership confirmed Liechtenstein&#x27;s sovereignty.

<doc id="774107" wikidata="Q53541" url="?curid=774107" title="Jean Batten">
<text>Jane Gardner Batten (15 September 1909 – 22 November 1982), commonly known as Jean Batten, was a New Zealand aviator who made several record-breaking flights – including the first solo flight from England to New Zealand in 1936.

Born in Rotorua, Batten went to England to learn to fly. She made two unsuccessful attempts to fly from England to Australia solo before achieving the feat in May 1934, taking just under 15 days to fly the distance in a Gipsy Moth biplane. The flight set the record for a woman&#x27;s solo flight between the two countries. After a publicity tour around Australia and New Zealand, she flew the Gipsy Moth back to England, setting the solo women&#x27;s record for the return flight from Australia to England. She also became the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia and back again. In November 1935, she set the absolute record of 61 hours, 15 minutes, for flying from England to Brazil. During this flight, in a Percival Gull Six monoplane, she completed the fastest crossing of the South Atlantic Ocean and was the first woman to make the England–South America flight. The pinnacle of her flying achievements came in October 1936, when she flew her Gull from England to New Zealand, covering the distance in a little over 11 days, an absolute record for 44 years. The following year she made her last major flight, flying from Australia to England to set a new solo record. 
During the Second World War, Batten unsuccessfully applied to join the Air Transport Auxiliary. Instead, she joined the short-lived Anglo-French Ambulance Corps and worked in the munitions industry. After the war, Batten lived a reclusive and nomadic life with her mother, Ellen Batten, in Europe and the Caribbean. Ellen, a strong personality who dominated her daughter, died in Tenerife in 1967, and soon afterwards Batten returned to public life with several appearances related to aviation and her records. Her death in Mallorca in November 1982 from complications of a dog bite went unnoticed until discovered by a journalist in September 1987.

==Early life==
Jane Gardner Batten was born on 15 September 1909 in Rotorua, New Zealand, to Frederick Batten, a dentist, and his wife Ellen . She was the only daughter of the couple, who were both first-generation New Zealanders of English descent. She had two older brothers and a third who had died soon after birth. Although named for her grandmother, she soon became known as Jean. Being the youngest child as well as sickly, her mother, who had a domineering personality, doted on her. When she was four, the Batten family moved to Auckland.

Commencing her education at a private school, Batten was switched to a state school in 1917. As her father had enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) to fight in the First World War, the family was on a reduced income. Batten&#x27;s mother encouraged her in activities considered to be masculine, taking her to Kohimarama to observe the flying boats of the flight school there. According to Batten&#x27;s unpublished memoirs, these visits inspired her to pursue flying. After the war, Fred Batten was discharged from the NZEF and resumed his career as a dentist, moving his family from Devonport, where they had been renting, to Epsom. Her parents&#x27; relationship, already brittle due to Fred&#x27;s extramarital relationships and Ellen&#x27;s aloofness and reluctance to step back from running the household following her husband&#x27;s return from the war, ended when the couple separated in 1920. This apparently affected Jean badly, who later vowed she would never get married. In later years Jean would deny her parents&#x27; breakup and maintain the marriage was a happy one.

Following the separation of her parents, Batten lived with her mother in Howick; Fred Batten, who lived with his sons near his dental practice on Queen Street, covered some living expenses. In 1922, Jean was sent to Ladies&#x27; College, a girls&#x27; boarding college in Remuera at her father&#x27;s expense. Although she later described her time at the school as a happy one, she had few friends and many of her fellow students found her to be aloof. She finished her education in late 1924, refusing to go back the following year for her fifth form year. Instead, she studied music and ballet with an intention of pursuing a career in one of these disciplines. She soon became an assistant teacher at the ballet school where she trained, playing the piano during classes.

In May 1927, Batten read of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s exploit in flying non-stop across the Atlantic. This stirred her childhood interest in aviation, which was further agitated in 1928 when the Australian pilot Charles Kingsford Smith flew from Australia to New Zealand in his &quot;Southern Cross&quot; Fokker F.VII aircraft. Batten&#x27;s father took her to a reception for Kingsford Smith in Auckland. On meeting him, she declared her intention to learn to fly, which Kingsford Smith considered to be a joke. She was humiliated and supposedly vowed to her mother afterwards that she would indeed fly. She followed this up in 1929 by taking a flight with Kingsford Smith while on a holiday in Sydney. On her return to Auckland, she informed her father of her intention to become a pilot, giving up plans to be a pianist or dancer. He did not approve, believing it an inappropriate career choice for a woman and refused to pay for flying lessons.
==Flight training==
Batten, encouraged by her mother, decided to go to England to learn to fly. As a pretext, she told her father that she was going to attend the Royal College of Music, although she later claimed he knew of her real intentions. Batten had a piano which she sold to fund the voyage to England for herself and her mother. In an interview given a few years later to a newspaper, Ellen Batten claimed she had property that was sold to supplement her daughter&#x27;s funds. Her father provided an allowance to help support her in her supposed musical studies. Batten and her mother left New Zealand in early 1930, travelling to England aboard the RMS &quot;Otranto&quot;.

On arrival in London in the spring of 1930, the duo found a room on James Street in the city&#x27;s West End. Although John Batten lived in London, working as a film actor with a key role in &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot;, they saw little of him in case he discovered their true purpose in England and wrote to Batten&#x27;s father. She joined the London Aeroplane Club (LAC), which was based at the Stag Lane Aerodrome in the northwest of London. In her unpublished memoirs, Batten wrote that she quickly took to flying and had a &quot;natural aptitude for it&quot;. However, other students remembered her as a slow learner. In fact, an early solo flight ended in a crash landing, an incident she never referred to in her later writings. She was also remembered for boasting about planning a solo flight to New Zealand. When, in May, Amy Johnson, who also trained at the LAC, completed the first solo flight for a female pilot from England to Australia in 19 days, Batten sought not only to emulate Johnson but beat her record.

Batten earned her pilot&#x27;s A licence on 5 December 1930. It had been a relatively protracted process; although only three hours of solo flying were required to qualify for the A licence, Batten could only accumulate the flying time in dribs and drabs. Limited funds prevented extensive flying time and she only flew short flights two or three times a week. It was at this time that her father discovered the true purpose of the trip to England and, angered by the deception, ceased paying her allowance. Despite this, Batten was still determined to beat Johnson&#x27;s England to Australia record but short of funds, in January 1931 she left with her mother for New Zealand. She hoped that family there would help fund her venture.

On the voyage to New Zealand, Batten met a fellow New Zealander, Flying Officer Fred Truman who was serving with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in British India and going home on leave. Closely chaperoned by her mother, the two struck up a friendship. Back in New Zealand, Batten reestablished a relationship with her father, whose anger at being deceived had eased by this time. He began to support her in her flying endeavours, paying for her to take lessons in navigation. Batten resumed flight training, joining the Auckland Aero Club, based at Māngere, and soon secured her New Zealand A pilot&#x27;s licence. Her friendship with Truman had grown and he fostered hopes of a relationship. He also flew with Batten at the Auckland Aero Club but this soon ended when he had to rejoin his squadron.

==Record attempts from England to Australia==

Batten still harboured ambitions of an attempt to break the solo England-Australia flight and sought a sponsor to provide the necessary funding. By mid-1931, she decided to seek a B licence, which was required to become a commercial pilot, in the belief that it would add to her credibility with potential sponsors. In July she returned to England aboard the SMS &quot;Rotorua&quot; and resumed her flight training at the LAC. This was paid for with a £500 loan from Truman, although this was never acknowledged by Batten, who later wrote in her autobiography that her mother, still in New Zealand, provided the necessary funds. Truman left the RAF in 1932 and was soon in London as well, tutoring Batten in navigation while he also worked towards gaining a B licence. Batten gained hers in December 1932 and then disentangled herself from Truman without ever paying back the £500 he lent her.

In addition to her flight training, Batten learnt how to maintain aircraft and their engines. This was helpful for while on a delivery flight for a Gipsy Moth biplane, she experienced engine trouble and had to land the aeroplane at Sandhurst Military Academy. She was able to facilitate a repair and continue the flight. During her time at the LAC, she met Victor Dorée, who came from a wealthy family. Dorée borrowed £400 from his mother to buy Batten a Gipsy Moth, with which she intended to beat Johnson&#x27;s record for flying from England to Australia solo. The agreement, as later recalled by Batten in her autobiography, entitled Dorée to half of any profits to be made from the endeavour. Batten modified the Gipsy Moth, acquired from the King&#x27;s Flight and previously flown by the then Prince of Wales, by fitting extra fuel tanks to increase its range to . Visas and landing rights in 14 countries were secured, she made arrangements for refueling, and obtained a plethora of information on landmarks along her route.

===First attempt===

On 9 April 1933, Batten commenced her flight to Australia, a trip of , flying from Lympne Aerodrome. The flight was planned to end by landing at Darwin in Australia. Her departure was widely reported and her mother, present for the occasion, gave an interview that appeared to give the impression of a united and well-off family. Batten was not the only pilot attempting to break the record for the trip to Australia at the time; she took off 24 hours after an Italian, Leonida Robbiano, started his endeavour from Lympne.

The first leg was to Rome and was the first non-stop solo effort to be made by a woman from England to Italy. Batten noted that this flight &quot;caused considerable comment&quot;. Over the next few days she made stops at Naples, Athens, Aleppo, and Baghdad. At Bushehr, in Iran, she encountered Robbiano who had run out of fuel. During the leg to Karachi, she made a forced landing due to a sandstorm. This damaged the propeller and with the help of locals, she travelled to Karachi to source a replacement, and then returned to the stranded aircraft. Delayed by 48 hours, she resumed her flight to Karachi, having fitted the new propeller. During the flight, she experienced engine trouble. Making a forced landing on a road, the Gipsy Moth was flipped onto its back. While she was unharmed, the accident put an end to her record flight attempt; she had flown .

With the assistance of personnel from the RAF station at Karachi, Batten&#x27;s aircraft was retrieved but without funds, she was unable to proceed. Then Charles Wakefield, the chairman of the Castrol oil company, intervened. He wanted to assist Batten and paid for her repatriation to England along with the wrecked Gipsy Moth. Back in England by early May, the Gipsy Moth was sold to the Brooklands Flying Club to be reconditioned. She could not persuade Dorée to buy her another aircraft and after this, she had nothing further to do with him.

===Second attempt===
Batten still intended to make her record flight and for several months, she unsuccessfully sought financial assistance from newspapers and aviation companies. She struggled to make ends meet in London, where she once again lived with her mother, whose allowance of £3 from Fred Batten was their only source of income. Due to a quarrel with her brother John, there was no financial assistance from him. The lack of funds meant her membership at the LAC lapsed and she was unable to fly. Finally, with £400 in funding from Castrol, she purchased a second-hand Gipsy Moth for £240. She kept her new aircraft at Brooklands, an aerodrome in Surrey, living nearby with her mother while the Gipsy Moth was prepared for her record attempt. During her time at Brooklands, she met Edward Walter, a fellow Gipsy Moth pilot who was a stockbroker. The two became engaged to be married within a few weeks of their meeting.

Batten commenced her second attempt on 21 April, departing from Lympne Aerodrome that morning and arriving at Marseilles for a refuelling stop in the early afternoon. Weather conditions were poor and the French authorities tried to dissuade her from leaving. When she did take off, it was only after signing an indemnity. By the time she had reached the Italian coast, it was dark, the flight having taken longer than expected due to headwinds. She ran out of fuel over Rome and glided to a crash landing at San Paolo wireless station. Contrary to her later claims of having &quot;very little damage&quot;, the Gipsy Moth was in a very bad state and she had received a cut to her face.

It took over a week for her aircraft to be repaired. The company carrying out the work did so for free, in acknowledgement of her courage, but Batten still had to source replacement parts. Walter sent over the propeller from his own aircraft, and a lower wing was borrowed from an Italian pilot who also owned a Gipsy Moth. Ten days after the crash, Batten flew her repaired aircraft back to England. She had decided to make a third attempt rather than continue with her present flight, which would have to include her time spent in Rome waiting for the repairs to her aircraft to be completed.

===Third attempt===

Batten arrived back at Brooklands on 6 May and promptly began preparing for her next flight. Despite Walter wanting her to give up on the record attempt, she persuaded him to lend her the lower wings of his Gipsy Moth. The set she had borrowed in Italy required refurbishment and she wanted to start her flight as soon as possible. Her aircraft was made ready and she departed from Lympne Aerodrome on 8 May, aiming to reach Australia in 14 days.

Batten flew to Marseilles, refuelled, and then went on to Rome, arriving at nighttime. The next day, she flew to Athens. The third day involved a single leg of around seven hours flying to Cyprus. Her flight from London to Cyprus was the first time this trip had been successfully completed by a solo pilot. On day four, the leg to Baghdad, she ran into sandstorms and this caused her to divert to Rutbah Wells, to the west of Baghdad. The next day she flew onto Basra and day six was a leg to Jask. Day seven was a flight to Karachi and passed without incident. Batten flew onto Jodhpur and then Allahabad on day eight, before going onto Calcutta, away, where she ended day nine by landing at Dum Dum Aerodrome.

Rangoon was the destination for day ten. On the following day, Batten encountered the Intertropical Convergence Zone, flying into stormy weather. With insufficient fuel to return to Rangoon, she carried on through driving rain and turbulence, relying on solely instruments at times, until she landed at Victoria Point. The rain meant she was unable to continue on to Alor Star, the planned final stop for the day. She flew to Alor Star the next day instead and after refueling there flew on to Salatar in Singapore to end day twelve. She was tracking well for her record attempt, being two days ahead of Johnson at the same stage of the flight. Media interest in her endeavour was increasing.

Day thirteen&#x27;s leg was to Batavia, in the Dutch East Indies. Fog delayed Batten&#x27;s departure the next day but she eventually took off and, after refueling at Surabaya, flew to Rambang on Lombok Island. Day fourteen was a single leg of two hours to Timor, during which she had to deal with fallout from a volcanic eruption on Flores Island. When she landed at Kupang, she was only from Australia. Batten&#x27;s trip was now front-page headlines in London. The final leg, on 23 May 1934, involved a flight across the Timor Sea to Darwin. Batten anticipated a flight time of around six hours but miscalculated, resulting in some anxious moments until the Australian landmass was sighted. She landed at Darwin&#x27;s aerodrome at 1:30pm. Her trip time of 14 days, 22 hours and 30 minutes had beaten Johnson&#x27;s record by over four days.

The breaking of Johnson&#x27;s record was front-page news around the world and there was extensive and generally effusive reporting on Batten&#x27;s feat by mainstream newspapers. However, &quot;The Times&quot; pointed out that the feat was achieved simply by spending less time on the ground and it saw little merit in record flights such as Batten&#x27;s. The aeronautical press was also more restrained, with &quot;Flight&quot; magazine crediting improvements in ground facilities as a factor in her achievement. While Batten&#x27;s successful solo flight was only the third to be made by a woman flying from Europe to Australia, the general route had already been flown thirty times and the overall record for a solo England to Australia flight stood at seven days, five hours, achieved by Kingsford-Smith the previous year. Much of the appeal for the public was due to Batten&#x27;s beauty and glamour which was in contrast to Johnson&#x27;s more down-to-earth nature.
==Australian tour==
Staying the night at Darwin, Batten commenced a flight to Sydney in her Gipsy Moth the next day. The journey took a week, with a delay in Queensland due to engine trouble. At each stop along the way, she was greeted by well-wishers and received telegrams, in addition to those she had received while at Darwin. It was during this trip that she gave an interview in which she announced her engagement to Walter, much to his displeasure as he then had to deal with reporters. She later wrote to him stating it was &quot;good publicity&quot;. Wakefield, keen to capitalise on the publicity, arranged for an escort airplane to accompany her and the Gipsy Moth was emblazoned with a Castrol sticker. He also encouraged Batten to maintain a high profile.

When Batten flew into Sydney on 30 May, a flight of 20 aircraft met her over the city&#x27;s harbour before she landed at Mascot aerodrome. A crowd of 5,000 was present to greet her. Several public engagements followed for the next four weeks during which she was hosted at the expense of the Australian Government. Wakefield soon gave her £1,000, although this was never publicly acknowledged by Batten. Acquaintances she met during this time noted her self-centred nature, and Nancy Bird, a well-known pilot of the 1930s, considered Batten to be a &quot;prima donna&quot;.

==New Zealand tour==
As her aircraft did not have the range to cross the Tasman Sea, Batten travelled to New Zealand by ship. The Gipsy Moth was shipped over at the expense of the Union Steam Ship Company. As in Australia, large crowds turned out to greet her and she was the guest of honour at numerous civic receptions. She also received a grant of £500 from the New Zealand Government, which hosted her at Government House for a time. She toured the country, giving people the opportunity to take £1 joyrides in her Gipsy Moth and giving paid lectures. In her home town of Rotorua, she was made an honorary &quot;rangitane&quot; (chieftainess) by Te Arawa, the local Māori &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe).

In her various public appearances, Batten regularly paid tribute to her mother. When Batten arrived at Darwin to end her record flight, one of her first acts was to send a telegram to Ellen. It read: &quot;Darling, we&#x27;ve done it. The aeroplane, you, me&quot;. Ellen joined her daughter in touring New Zealand, having travelled there by steamship. Shortly after her arrival, she gave an interview stating that Batten and Walter were not engaged. This was contrary to Batten&#x27;s own earlier comments on the matter but she never contradicted her mother.

By the end of her New Zealand visit in September 1934, Batten had created an image of herself as a skilled and courageous aviator. She was now firmly established as an international hero and a source of pride for New Zealand. However, she downplayed her flying accidents and the financial support she had received earlier in her career and the difference between her public and private personas was noted; the Castrol representative accompanying her on her tour of New Zealand found her to be arrogant and immodest. She made a significant sum of money from the tour, around £2,500, equivalent to about £100,000 in 2014, but did not pay back Truman or Dorée. In fact, she later wrote that the flight &quot;had not been a great financial success&quot;.

Returning to Australia, Batten was a radio commentator at the MacRobertson Air Race, for aircraft flying from England to Melbourne in honour of the city&#x27;s centenary. She had hoped to enter the race itself, which had a first prize of £10,000, but was unable to get to England in time for the start on 20 October. Afterwards, she returned to Sydney, where she had temporarily based herself, intending in due course to go onto England and marry Walter. She was now also a published author; her account of her record-breaking flight was published by Jackson &amp; O&#x27;Sullivan Limited in Sydney as &quot;Solo Flight&quot;. The book did not sell well, with one reviewer describing it as &quot;not a brilliant book&quot; and another considered the transcript of the log of her flight to be the most interesting part of the book.

While in Sydney, she met Beverly Shepherd, a 23-year-old who was training to become a commercial pilot and a relationship promptly developed. According to Batten, this was much to the displeasure of Ellen, who regarded her daughter as being committed to Walter, even though she had previously publicly denied the existence of the couple&#x27;s engagement. By March 1935, the engagement was off. Batten had written to Walter to end the relationship but it was reported in the media prior to him receiving her letter. This left him bitter at the news. She later wrote that on arriving in Australia to complete her record flight, she realised that she wanted to prioritise her aviation career for a few years and saw marriage as compromising her ambitions.

==Return to England==
By April 1935, Batten was preparing to fly her Gipsy Moth back to England. Although it was not publicly declared, she hoped to set a new record for flying time between Australia and England. In her autobiography, she stated that the purpose of her return was to be in London for the Silver Jubilee of George V. Shepherd accompanied her in his own de Havilland Puss Moth part of the way to Darwin, from where she was to leave Australia. She commenced the first leg on 12 April, heading for Kupang in Timor. About halfway through the flight across the Timor Sea, her engine stopped; she had to glide for some time, nearly ditching in the sea, before successfully restarting it. The engine continued to play up for the remainder of the trip. On arriving at Kupang, she cleaned some of the components of the fuel system as she and a Dutch mechanic suspected dust was to blame for the problem. Despite this, she continued to experience similar intermittent engine problems for the remainder of her journey to England.

Batten largely followed the reverse of the route flown on her outward trip to Australia. She avoided the worst of the Intertropical Convergence Zone but was slowed by headwinds flying west across West Asia. She had further engine trouble over Italy and by the time she reached Marseilles, there was only a slim chance of beating her record, and even then it would only be by a few minutes. However, she suffered a puncture and more engine problems. She arrived at Croydon, in England, having taken 17 days, 16 hours, to make the journey from Australia to England. She was still the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia and back again. Although only a few people were at Croydon for her arrival, her return to England was widely reported. When interviewed, she claimed that she had no help or financial backing, and credited her persistence for the successful endeavour. This disregarded the support provided by Castrol. In recognition of her record flight, the Women&#x27;s International Association of Aeronautics, in the United States, awarded her its Challenge Trophy for 1934.

==England to Brazil==
Batten had turned her mind to a record flight from England to South America even before she had left Australia in April. Few pilots had attempted record flights over the South Atlantic; the record at the time was 16 hours, 30 minutes, held by the Spaniard Juan Ignacio Pombo, and no female had yet done it solo. The record for the quickest flight from England to Brazil was held by Jim Mollison, who achieved it in three days, ten hours, and Batten decided to attempt to break this record as well. However, the route was already in use by Zeppelin airships and the French airline Aero-postale also regularly crossed the South Atlantic for its mail service. At least one aviation journal thought Batten&#x27;s record attempt, once it became public knowledge, had little value. 

To replace the Gipsy Moth, Batten purchased a Percival Gull Six monoplane. Much faster than her old aeroplane, it had a six-cylinder 200 horsepower de Havilland Gipsy Six engine, electrically operated fuel pumps and starter motor, an enclosed cabin that seated three people and was capable of flying per hour. She arranged for the Gull to be fitted with auxiliary fuel tanks, giving it a range of , and a discreet toilet tube. She took delivery of the aircraft, finished in silver with the registration G-ADPR, on 15 September, her birthday. According to Batten, it had cost £1,750, &quot;practically every penny&quot; she had. Mackersey doubts the accuracy of this statement, pointing out Batten had received fees from newspapers and film companies, as well as money earned from the Australian flight and the sale of her Gipsy Moth.

Batten planned to start from Lympne Aerodrome, flying to Casablanca, go onto Dakar, in West Africa, via Villa Cisneros in the Spanish Sahara, and then flying across the South Atlantic to land at Port Natal in Brazil. When she left on 11 November 1935, it was to news that Kingsford Smith had disappeared off the coast of Burma during an attempt to make the quickest England-Australia flight. Making Casablanca without incident she left the next day for a military airfield at Thies. This was a late change to her itinerary due to the aerodrome at Dakar being under repair. However, on arrival she found that her fuel was still at Dakar. It was dispatched and arrived at midnight whereupon she immediately organised the refuelling of her Gull.

After a short nap, and despite a pessimistic weather forecast, Batten left Thies at 4:45am, 13 November. Because of the short airfield, and the amount of fuel being carried, she opted to lighten the load of her aircraft. Among other items, she left behind her tool kit, signal pistol, spare engine parts, emergency water and life raft. She soon ran into the South Atlantic convergence zone and the weather encountered at this stage meant that she effectively flew blind for some time. A local magnetic disturbance affected her compass, and she had to resort to her turn indicator to keep her bearing. Despite these difficulties, she still encountered her target landmark, Cap San Roque, once she reached the Brazilian coastline after 12 and a half hours of flying. She landed at Port Natal thirteen hours, 15 minutes, after her departure from Thies; this lowered the record for a solo crossing of the South Atlantic by three hours. It took her two days, thirteen hours and 15 minutes to fly from England to Brazil, breaking Mollison&#x27;s record by nearly 24 hours. She also had achieved the overall fastest flight time for crossing the Atlantic, beating by 22 minutes the record set by a four-engined Air France aeroplane.

The next day, 14 November, Batten set out for Rio de Janeiro, a flight of around 10 hours. On the way, the Gull suffered a fuel leak and she landed on a beach about from her destination. She was able to find shelter in a nearby village. According to Batten, she telegraphed for assistance but there was considerable consternation when she did not arrive at Rio at her scheduled time and, in the absence of knowledge of her whereabouts, search and rescue aircraft were dispatched in the morning. After a few hours, her Gull, and Batten herself, were located. The Brazilian Air Force provided fuel and repaired her propeller, damaged when landing, and she continued onto Rio, landing at Campos dos Alfonsos. 
To acknowledge her success, the Brazilian President, Dr. Vargas, presented her with the Order of the Southern Cross; according to Batten, she was the first British woman, other than Royalty, to be so honoured. She was gifted money by the local British Chamber of Commerce and made an honorary officer in the Brazilian Air Force, which also presented her a trophy, &quot;The Spirit of Aviation&quot;. She then flew onto Argentina and Uruguay and while in Buenos Aires, she received an offer from Charles Lindbergh to make a lecture tour of the United States. She declined, opting instead to return to England. According to Peggy Kelman, an Australian aviator of the 1930s interviewed by Mackersey, Batten had written to her mother for permission to take the tour but this was not forthcoming and she was ordered to go back to England. She arrived at Southampton on 23 December aboard the RMS &quot;Asturias&quot;, the Gull in its hold. In her autobiography, Batten makes no mention of Lindberg&#x27;s offer, noting that she wanted to be in London for Christmas.

==Interlude==
After spending Christmas Day with her mother in Hatfield, Batten went to Southampton to fly her Gull back to Hatfield aerodrome. During the flight, she crashed her aeroplane. In an interview given to a reporter of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, she blamed an engine failure that forced her to glide to a crash landing on South Downs, in West Sussex. She suffered a cut to her head and a concussion, while the Gull&#x27;s wings were twisted and its undercarriage was torn away. The Gull was taken to Gravesend to be repaired. During this time, and claiming her aeroplane was &quot;being overhauled&quot;, she went to Paris to receive a gold medal presented by the French Academy of Sports and met Louis Blériot. The French Government shortly announced its intention to award her the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.

She received further honours: these included the Britannia Trophy, awarded by the Royal Aero Club for the most meritorious flight of 1935 to be made by a British subject, the Challenge Trophy, which she was awarded for the second time by the Women&#x27;s International Association of Aeronautics, and the Harmon Trophy, jointly awarded to Batten and Amelia Earhart. The Daily Express also named her as one of its five &quot;Women of 1935&quot;.

Once her Gull was repaired, Batten took her mother on a flying holiday to Spain and Morocco. When back in England, she often attended public engagements and functions but otherwise was largely reclusive. In June, Batten was created Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for &quot;general services to aviation&quot;. The New Zealand Government had agitated for Batten to be made a Dame but this was not entertained by officials in London, who were reluctant to reward risky record flight attempts. She was invested with the CBE by King Edward VIII in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 14 July.

==England to New Zealand==
By this time, Batten&#x27;s preparations for another world record flight, from England to New Zealand, were underway. She also aimed to break the men&#x27;s record for the England-Australia flight, which stood at six days, 21 hours, and was held by Jimmy Broadbent. Batten and her mother had completed an walking trip across the South Downs for fitness while the Gull was being prepared. She spent time in London obtaining the necessary permissions to fly over the countries along her route. The latest maps were purchased and facilities were arranged for her stops on the way to New Zealand.

In the presence of a large media turnout, Batten departed Lympne Aerodrome on the morning of 5 October 1936. With stops at Marseilles, Brindisi, Cyprus, Syria, and Basra, she arrived at Karachi after two and a half days of flying. She had deliberately kept her rest time to a minimum, and the operational ceiling of the Gull allowed her to fly at a height that avoided the worst of the turbulence. Batten then flew onto Akyab, in Burma, a distance of with a stop for fuel at Allahabad. Making an early start the next day, 9 October, she departed at 1:00am for Alor Star, in British Malaya. She encountered bad weather during the flight and was unable to land at Alor Star. Instead, she had to go on to Penang, a further away. She had a fright when she realised the driving rain was stripping the fabric and dope (a lacquer used to weatherproof aircraft fabric) from the leading edges of her wings; this required repair at Penang. She flew onto Singapore while it was still light, and the repair work to her wings was performed at the RAF station there. By this time, her total flight time was four days, 17 hours. She left for Rambang, on Lombok, that night and then onto Kupang in Timor. Here she discovered that the tailwheel of the Gull, part of the landing gear, had a puncture. It took several hours to effect a repair, and by then it was too late to leave for Darwin. She was phlegmatic about the delay for it allowed her to have much-needed sleep. She left Kupang at dawn, 11 October, and arrived at Darwin after four hours of flying, where a large crowd had gathered to greet her. She had problems landing; the throttle stuck open on one attempt. On the second, one of the main wheel brakes failed, causing the Gull to perform a ground loop before coming to a halt. The total trip time from England to Australia was five days, 21 hours, which set a new absolute record for a solo flight for this route. Batten&#x27;s achievement was front-page news around the world.

===Delay in Australia===
Batten was conscious that she needed to push on to Auckland in New Zealand, still some away. From Darwin, she flew onto Longreach in Queensland, where she spent the night. Despite many locals turning out to meet her, she declined to greet them and also refused media interviews. She flew onto Sydney the next day, being greeted by a fleet of aircraft over the city&#x27;s harbour that would escort her into the Mascot airfield. Here she was delayed for two days; the weather over the Tasman was not favourable for a crossing and in addition, there was also public opposition to making the flight in a single-engined aircraft, as the Tasman was noted for difficult weather and the majority of the previous crossings had been achieved in multi-engine aircraft. Batten suspected sexism played a role, noting that &quot;...Australia like New Zealand is still very much &#x27;a man&#x27;s country&#x27;&quot;. She also had difficulties with officialdom. The Australian Civil Aviation Department would not allow her to leave on account that the amount of fuel that the Gull would need to carry to make the flight over the Tasman would make its overall weight exceed the limit on its certificate of airworthiness. This was overcome when she was able to produce a special endorsement provided by the British authorities that allowed the Gull to takeoff with an extra of weight beyond what was stipulated on its certificate of airworthiness.

The delay due to the poor weather over the Tasman meant that she was able to make herself available to the media. She earned £600 for a radio interview and secured exclusive deals with a consortium of newspapers and film companies. Media mogul Frank Packer offered her £5,000 to stay in Australia and do a lecture tour rather than fly to New Zealand. She declined, preferring the &quot;honour of completing the first solo flight from England to New Zealand and linking the two countries in direct flight for the first time in history&quot;. While waiting for the Tasman to clear, she also spent time, albeit limited, with Beverly Shepherd, who was now an airline captain.

===Trans-Tasman crossing===
On 16 October, Batten departed for New Zealand at 4:35am, local time. She left from the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s airbase at Richmond, the longer runway giving her more space to get her heavily loaded Gull in the air. The weather forecast was still not ideal; rather than flying direct to Auckland, where she was to land at Mangere Aerodrome, she decided to aim for New Plymouth, a slightly shorter distance over the sea, and then fly north to Māngere. Before she left, at 4:30am in front of a large press contingent, she specifically instructed that if she came down in the Tasman, no one was to be sent to look for her. She did not want anyone&#x27;s life to be put at risk.

The flight to New Plymouth, about from Richmond, took nine and a half hours, a record for the Trans-Tasman crossing. Due to rain clouds and squalls, she flew below most of the way so she could observe her drift. She did a flypast for a crowd gathered at New Plymouth airfield and then flew north to Māngere as planned. She landed just after 5:00pm in front of a crowd of around 6,000 people. She had set a record of eleven days, 45 minutes for a direct flight from England to New Zealand; this would stand for 44 years before it was broken. She also set a record of ten and a half hours for the crossing from Sydney to Auckland. In her autobiography, she described the cheers from the crowd at Māngere as the &quot;greatest moment in my life&quot;, sentiments she expressed in her speech to the crowd. Her father was among those who greeted her, although he was given short-shrift as Batten focussed on the adulation from the crowd and the official reception party.

Batten&#x27;s feat was widely reported around the world, with media comparing her to Amy Johnson and Amelia Earhart. The &quot;Times&quot; in London called the endeavour &quot;an act of deliberate courage&quot;. Telegrams flooded in; according to Batten, there were 1,700 cables received from overseas. The Government provided her with four secretaries to help her respond to all of them. At a civic reception held in Auckland a few days later, the city&#x27;s mayor announced the naming of &quot;Jean Batten Place&quot; in her honour.

==Publicity tour==
Batten embarked on a publicity tour, eager to make money. She wanted to recover the expenses incurred on her England-New Zealand flight and have some profit to fund further flying, despite the effort likely &quot;overdrawing on [her] reserve energy&quot;. This began on the day of her arrival at Māngere when she collected a portion of the fees charged for vehicle parking at the aerodrome. Despite being fatigued, the same evening she gave the first lecture of her tour at an Auckland cinema. Her Gull was later displayed at a shop in Auckland, where people paid to see it. She began to charge a shilling for her autograph and signed several hundred books. A public subscription raised over £2,000 for her.

She soon found her tour was compromised by the exclusive contracts she had entered into with the media while in Sydney; two minders controlled the public and rival media&#x27;s access to her. This impacted public reporting of her tour and attendance suffered. In addition, behind the scenes, Batten exhibited self-centred behaviour which alienated many who witnessed it. While in Auckland, she also had a confrontation with Fred Truman, who had loaned her £500 back in 1931. Batten had steadfastly ignored his pleas to repay the debt. In the end, he approached Batten&#x27;s father regarding the amount owed. Fred Batten, embarrassed at discovering Batten was so indebted, facilitated a meeting between his daughter and Truman, at which she handed over a cheque for £250 and swiftly departed. The balance was never repaid.

By the time Batten arrived in Christchurch, she was depressed at the poor attendance of her lecture tour and physically exhausted. She took a rest on medical advice. The remainder of the tour was cancelled, and she later described the decision as a result of being &quot;too tired to carry on&quot;. Most of November was spent in the South Island, on the West Coast and at Franz Josef Glacier, at the expense of the Government. By the end of the month, her morale had been boosted with news of more honours. For the second successive year, she was awarded the Royal Aero Club&#x27;s Britannia Trophy for the most meritorious performance in aviation by a British subject. She was awarded the Harmon Trophy again, this time outright, for her 1936 flights. Finally, she received the Segrave Trophy, awarded for the &quot;most outstanding demonstration during the year of the possibilities of transport on land, water or air&quot;. She later wrote that this &quot;was a very great honour&quot;.

At the end of November, Batten travelled to Sydney where she was going to meet her mother who had left England after hearing of her daughter&#x27;s breakdown. While in Sydney awaiting the arrival of Ellen Batten, she reunited with Beverly Shepherd. The two spent several days together. In her unpublished memoirs, she wrote that Shepherd struggled with being with someone as famous as her. Once Ellen arrived, she and Batten returned to New Zealand where they would remain for three months. For part of the time, they were joined by Fred Batten, presenting an image of a united family, as her parents&#x27; separation was not public knowledge. Christmas was spent in her birthplace of Rotorua, where she was honoured by local Māori, as she had been after her 1934 journey. She was given a chief&#x27;s &quot;kahu huruhuru&quot; (feather cloak) and conferred with the title Hine-o-te-Rangi – &quot;Daughter of the Skies&quot;.

In February 1937, Batten, accompanied by her mother, travelled to Sydney to join Shepherd. Publicly, she gave the impression of wanting to continue flying despite friends apparently trying to persuade her to settle down, writing &quot;the fire of adventure that burned within me was not yet quenched&quot; but privately, she expressed a keen desire to marry Shepherd, who was flying from Brisbane to meet her in Sydney. The evening of her arrival on 19 February, she discovered he was missing; the passenger airliner on which he was co-pilot had failed to arrive. Batten was involved in the search for the missing aircraft, even after it was officially called off after five days. The public at large remained unaware of her keen interest in Shepherd; she maintained that her interest was simply as a close friend of one of the missing pilots, describing him as &quot;a great friend of mine&quot;. The wreck of the aircraft was discovered in the MacPherson Ranges by the bushman Bernard O&#x27;Reilly on 28 February, with two survivors. It had crashed during a storm and burst into flames. Shepherd was among the dead.

In her unpublished memoirs, Batten admitted to profound grief at the loss of Shepherd. She withdrew from society and with her mother, moved to a flat near Sydney&#x27;s beaches. The two lived in Australia for the next eight months and for much of this time, Batten was undecided about her future plans. Then, in September, she learnt that Broadbent was going to attempt to break her record for the England-Australia flight; he then held the record of six days, nine hours for the Australia-England flight. Batten shortly announced her intention to break Broadbent&#x27;s record.

==Australia to England==

Batten planned to use her Percival Gull for the attempt and arranged for its engine to be overhauled. For her personal fitness, she embarked on a programme of swimming, skipping and running. Her mother in the meantime departed Australia so that she could be in England to greet Batten when she arrived. To cover her expenses, Batten sought sponsorship from Frank Packer; his interest was lukewarm, advising her that with regular air services to Australia, the days of pioneering flights were over. In the end, he agreed to an exclusive deal whereby she would prepare a 200-word report at the end of each day. Newspapers were describing the event as a duel between Batten and Broadbent. Batten noted that it was &quot;infinitely more difficult to fly from Australia to England than in the opposite direction&quot; because headwinds &quot;retard progress on the route in England&quot;. Journalists questioned the value of the attempt, one noting that with the advancement of commercial aviation, &quot;the day of the adventure flier draws to a close&quot;.

After a delay because of weather, Batten&#x27;s record attempt commenced from Darwin on 19 October 1937, with a flight to Rambang on Lombok Island, where she refueled, and flew onto Batavia to finish her first day. It had been nearly of flying. Rising early, she commenced the next leg, to Alor Star, while it was still dark. According to her autobiography, she encountered thunderstorms within an hour of her departure and much of her flight was spent flying on instruments. After a brief stop at Alor Star, she carried on to Rangoon, arriving there just 36 hours after commencing the record attempt from Darwin. She had already flown . The next day, she flew to Karachi, with a stop for fuel at Allahabad. She had flown part of the leg at just to minimise the effect of the prevailing headwind. The heat was such that the soles of her shoes became stuck to the rudder pedals. On her arrival, she was advised that she was the first solo pilot to make the flight from Rangoon to Karachi in a single day. After a four-hour rest, she resumed her flight, proceeding to Basra, then Damascus and onto Athens. As she crossed the Mediterranean, a major storm was encountered and, according to her autobiography, she also experienced the St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire phenomenon about the hub of her propeller.

The next leg was scheduled to be to Rome but low cloud cover over the city forced her to land at Naples instead, where she spent the night. Exhausted, on landing she had to be bodily lifted from the cockpit of the Gull and given stimulants. The weather prognosis for the next day, 24 October, was not favourable, particularly over the Mediterranean. Regardless, encouraged by many cables of support received overnight, she departed that morning for Marseilles. She skirted some storm systems to land at Marseilles and then carried onto England, where she landed at Lympne Aerodrome in the mid-afternoon. A small enthusiastic crowd was present to cheer her on arrival.

Batten had completed the flight in 5 days, 19 hours and 15 minutes. As well as lowering Broadbent&#x27;s record by just over half a day, she also became the first person to hold the solo record for both the outward and inward flights. Broadbent&#x27;s attempt on her England to Australia record had ended in Iraq, where he ran out of fuel. She also was within four hours of the all-time record for the fastest flight time from Australia to England, this being held by Owen Cathcart Jones and Ken Waller who had flown the trip in the multi-engined de Havilland DH.88 Comet in 1934.

After 20 minutes clearing customs at Lympne Aerodrome, Batten took off again for Croydon, at the time London&#x27;s international airport. A large crowd of 10,000 was present to greet her, Ellen Batten among them. Broadbent had sent a cable of congratulations which was also awaiting her. Batten was moved by the reception at Croydon, noting that it felt &quot;more like a homecoming than just the final landing of a record flight&quot;. Her exploit was front page news the next day; one major newspaper headlined its first page as &quot;The Girl Who Has Beaten All The Men&quot;.

It was Batten&#x27;s last long-distance flight as a pilot.

==European tour==
With her latest record flight completed, Batten was hosted at Grosvenor Hotel in London and gave a press conference. Many questions were regarding her plans for marriage but she refused to comment on the subject. Her mother noted that Batten was too busy to consider marriage and also reiterated how much she had financially supported her daughter in her record ambitions. A publicity tour for Batten followed; she was interviewed for BBC television and radio and attended a series of banquets and receptions. Madame Tussauds made Batten&#x27;s effigy in wax and she was also presented to the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace, meeting King Leopold of Belgium at the same time. By this time she was living with her mother in a flat in Kensington.

In early 1938, she was awarded the medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, aviation&#x27;s highest honour; she was the first woman to receive the medal. Her autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, was published later in May but was poorly received, in much the same way as her previous book had been. She began to tour continental Europe with her Percival Gull; she was hosted by Blèriot&#x27;s widow in Paris, King Leopold in Brussels, and by the Swedish royal family in Stockholm. Holidays in Milan and Lake Como followed. Early in 1939 she commenced a lecture tour of Scandinavia and the Baltic States on behalf of the British Council; she was well received with favourable reports being sent back to London.

With her mother, Batten embarked on a spring cruise in the Caribbean, funded by the profits from her lecture tour. Another holiday, separate from Ellen, followed in the late summer, staying in Sweden with Axel Wenner-Gren, an industrialist who was the owner of Electrolux. At the time, tensions in Europe were high, with the outbreak of war imminent. Batten was ignorant of this and was planning trips to Finland and Oslo before beginning her next lecture tour in October. Just before the end of the month she was advised by the British Foreign Ministry to not travel over German airspace when returning to England. She sought help from Wenner-Gren, who used his connections with Germany to secure clearance for Batten to fly her Percival Gull back over the North Sea with a stop at Hamburg. According to her biographer, Batten later claimed that while at Hamburg, German fighter pilots there blew her kisses. She arrived back in England on 27 August; it was to be the last time she flew herself.

==Second World War==
Within days of the outbreak of the Second World War, Batten wrote to Harold Balfour, the Under-Secretary of State for Air, offering her services as a pilot, and her Percival Gull, for communication work. He indicated that her name would be added to a pool of civilian pilots to be called upon by the RAF. She also had Sir Francis Shelmerdine, who was the head of the National Air Communications, an agency concerned with the coordination of civil aviation for the war effort, advocating on her behalf. She hoped to join the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), formed at the start of the war to provide experienced pilots for ferrying aircraft. Initially, there was no place for women, but in early 1940 a female section was formed at Hatfield with Amy Johnson being an early member.

According to Batten&#x27;s unpublished memoirs, she failed the required medical, blaming shortsightedness caused by the strain of inspecting maps in poor light during her record flight attempts. However, several of the other female pilots had imperfect vision and one flew with glasses. Mackersey speculates that Batten desired a role with the ATA that would only require her to fly her Gull. When this was not forthcoming, her enthusiasm to fly with the ATA was dimmed and later in the year, the Gull was requisitioned for war service.

Batten instead became a driver for the Anglo-French Ambulance Corps. This only lasted a few months and she mainly fundraised for vehicles. The Germans conquered France before she was dispatched there and the unit was subsequently disbanded. She then began working at a munitions factory in Poole, Dorset, renting an apartment nearby. Her mother moved to Dorchester and on her days off, Batten would visit her.

In 1943 she moved to London, taking up a residence in Baker Street with her mother, and began working for the National Savings Committee. She solicited donations from the public in aid of the war effort, and visited factories, industrial facilities and town halls throughout the country. According to her unpublished memoirs, during this time she met and fell in love with an RAF bomber pilot whom she identified only as Richard. She claimed to have made plans with him for the future but he was reported missing on a bombing raid later in the war.

==Later life==
In the postwar period, Batten and her mother moved to Jamaica. Ellen Batten had struggled with her health for most of the winter months of the war years and desired to live in a more hospitable climate. Jamaica, which Batten and her mother had visited in 1939, appealed as a place to settle permanently. When the Battens arrived in November 1946, few of their friends knew where they were living; they maintained a poste restante at Thomas Cook &amp; Son in London. Initially renting a house, they later bought a plot of land on the coast and had a dwelling, which Batten named &#x27;Blue Horizon&#x27;, built on it.

By 1953, Batten and her mother desired a return to England. &#x27;Blue Horizon&#x27; was sold, along with their furniture, and they departed shortly afterwards by ship for Liverpool. Before they left, they invested in plots of land in Discovery Bay. For the next seven years, the duo toured Europe, going on numerous road trips and staying in low-budget hotels. The land they had purchased before leaving Jamaica was developed and sold in 1957 for a significant profit, helping fund their Europe sojourn. With Batten&#x27;s mother now in her eighties and struggling with the cold of the European winters, they spent an increasing period of time in the south of Spain. Finding the area particularly to their liking, in 1960 they purchased a villa in the Costa de Sol. They based themselves there until 1965, at which time they sold the villa and resumed their travels, beginning with a trip to Portugal by road and then travelling onto Madeira. At about the same time, Batten was invited to attend the opening of the new Auckland International Airport, sited at Mangere. Writing from Maderia, she declined on account of the event conflicting with a prearranged tour of the Canary Islands and Morocco.

Batten&#x27;s mother was 89 by the time they began their trip to the Canary Islands. She died on 19 July 1966 on the island of Tenerife, at San Marcos, a fishing village where the two had rented an apartment. Batten arranged for the interment of her mother&#x27;s remains at an Anglican cemetery in Puerto de la Cruz. The headstone inscription read &quot;Ellen Batten beloved mother of Jean Batten&quot; and lacked acknowledgement of her other children or her husband Fred Batten. The words &quot;Jean Batten&quot; were inscribed in a larger font size than that used for her mother&#x27;s name. In a state of depression, Batten disregarded an offer from her brother to stay with him in Auckland and instead went back to Jamaica to stay with a friend there. However, she insisted on seclusion and did not mix with other former acquaintances while there, and after a time returned to Tenerife. Her father died in July 1967, but this had nowhere near the effect on her as her mother&#x27;s death.

==Return to public life==
After three years as a recluse from society, Batten returned to public life in 1969 when she was invited to be present at the start of an air race from England to Australia. She revamped her image by dyeing her hair, undergoing cosmetic surgery and updating her wardrobe. Once in London, she attended a number of events, and was with Sir Francis Chichester when he started the air race. None of the competitors were able to lower her record for the England-Australia flight, much to her pleasure. She was reunited with her Percival Gull, part of the Shuttleworth Collection, joined the British Women Pilots&#x27; Association, and gave interviews for BBC radio and television. Although appearing outgoing, at least one acquaintance noted that her conversation largely consisted of herself and her past achievements. Another observed the dichotomy in her personality; introverted in private but extroverted at public events in her honour.

She went to Australia and New Zealand early the following year but initially kept a low profile. Batten only reunited with some of her family once they discovered she was in New Zealand; she had not let them know she was there until she was interviewed by a local newspaper. Initially staying in a hotel, she was later hosted by her nephews and niece and their families, although they soon found her demanding and inconsiderate. Once the public became aware she was in the country, she attended some events; one was the opening of a school in Māngere that was named for her. She became patron of the New Zealand Airwoman&#x27;s Association and spoke at public gatherings. Most of her interviews were published in women&#x27;s magazines and she gave few details of her lifestyle other than to allude to one of excitement and glamour.

Batten returned to England in April 1970 but shortly afterwards was invited to attend a fundraising banquet in Australia. The flight there and back would be provided at no cost by Qantas, and she quickly accepted the invitation. In Australia, she met with acquaintances, some of whom noted that she talked of little but her record-breaking flights rather than more recent events in her life. Peggy Kelman, the Australian aviator who had met Batten in the 1930s, later described conversations in which Batten admitted to being dominated by her mother. Kelman also flew a light aircraft with Batten as a passenger, and offered her the controls; Batten refused. She ended up staying in Australia for nearly three months, travelling across the country at the expense of Qantas and being hosted for free. Eventually, tired from her visit, she asked for a flight to Fiji to recuperate before going to the United States. There she did a tour at the behest of the Ninety-Nines, an association of female pilots, before returning to Tenerife in October.

For the next few years, Batten made occasional trips to England; she was an advocate of the Concorde supersonic airliner, having viewed the prototype back in 1969 and longed to fly in it to New Zealand. She made further visits to see its progress and wrote to newspapers in support of the project. Buoyed by the public response to the end of her seclusion, she loaned her papers and memorabilia to the RAF museum at Hendon for the purpose of establishing an archive although much material relating to her personal life, particularly correspondence with her family, and also men with whom she had relationships was filtered out. She also commenced writing her memoirs, which she titled &quot;Luck and the Record Breaker&quot;, intended for publication after her death.

In April 1977 she was guest of honour at the opening of the Aviation Pioneers Pavilion at Auckland&#x27;s Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT). Acquaintances were startled at her appearance at this time; her hair had been dyed blonde and she appeared underweight. While in New Zealand, she became ill and stayed with the director of the MOTAT. The director, in the belief she had limited funds, sought financial relief from the government. As a result, she was granted NZ$1,000 along with a weekly state pension of NZ$46. However, unknown to anyone, she actually had enough assets to provide a comfortable standard of living. She later stayed with family before returning to Tenerife before the end of the year.

Batten was soon contacted by Robert Pooley, of Airlife Publishing, who wanted to republish her 1938 book &quot;My Life&quot;. She refused to update it, wanting to have her memoirs published separately later once they were completed. Organising the publication of her book, re-titled &quot;Alone in the Sky&quot; took two years. She returned to New Zealand in late 1979, flying partway on the Concorde, thanks to the generosity of the National Bank which invited her to open a new branch in her home country. She remained for the summer, doing promotional work for &quot;Alone in the Sky&quot;.

After spending the northern summer in Tenerife, Batten was in Australia in November 1980 for the 60th anniversary of the founding of Qantas. While there, her solo record for the England-Australia flight was broken by Judith Chisholm, an airline pilot, who flew a Cessna Centurion to achieve the feat. She then flew to Auckland on 25 November, breaking Batten&#x27;s solo record for the England-New Zealand flight as well. As a courtesy, Qantas flew Batten on a Boeing 747 to Auckland to greet Chisholm. During the flight, made while Chisholm crossing the Tasman Sea, the two briefly spoke via radio. Batten publicly congratulated Chisholm for breaking her longstanding records, noting that her own flight was made &quot;as a pioneer&quot; and it could not be compared to Chisholm&#x27;s. According to friends she later complained of the technological advantage that made the feat much easier to achieve. She was back in Tenerife in early 1981, her focus now on a Concorde return flight between England and New Zealand, being organised by Pooley to commemorate the 45th anniversary of her record flight of 1936. Scheduled to depart London in October with Batten as the guest of honour, tickets cost £3,450. She was engaged in publicity events to help ticket sales, one of which was a ceremony at Luton Airport where Britannia Airways named one of its Boeing 737 aircraft after her. Despite Batten&#x27;s urging and berating of Pooley, the Concorde flight was cancelled in early October due to poor sales, much to her disappointment.

==Final years and death==
In the spring of 1982, Batten sold her apartment in Tenerife. By this time, her neighbours found her increasingly eccentric and noted that she would go to extreme lengths to avoid personal interaction. Much of her personal papers and memorabilia, including her memoirs, were packaged into a suitcase and consigned to Britannia Airways at Luton Airport for her later collection. She was in England in August, having spent some of the previous weeks in Gibraltar. Having caught up with Pooley, she informed him of her plan to look for property in Mallorca and avoid contact for a time. She left England in October, writing to her publisher on 8 November to advise of her temporary address in Mallorca and to query a taxation issue with her royalty payments for &quot;Alone in the Sky&quot;.

In November 1982, Batten, staying at a hotel in Mallorca, was bitten by a dog. Batten refused medical treatment but the wound became infected and she developed a pulmonary abscess. She died alone in her hotel room on 22 November from complications from the dog bite. There was some confusion as to her identity and she was not buried until 22 January 1983. She was interred in a communal pauper&#x27;s grave under her middle name, Gardner, with 150 other people. Officials in Palma Majorca erred in not informing her family or the New Zealand Government.

While her family and acquaintances were used to her being regularly out of touch, over time there was increasing concern as to Batten&#x27;s welfare. The letter that she had written to her publisher was the last anyone had heard from her as she had sent no further correspondence. Uncollected mail was building up at her poste restante and there had been no transactions on her bank account. In 1984, prompted by Pooley who had had no contact from Batten for some time, the New Zealand High Commission in London began a search for her but to no avail. Batten&#x27;s reclusive nature and distant relationships hindered progress. By February 1987 official efforts to locate her had ceased. It was not until the following September that journalist Ian Mackersey discovered her fate as part of his research into a television documentary on her life. Batten&#x27;s death and the circumstances of its discovery were widely reported. When her estate was probated, it was valued at nearly £100,000 (). As Batten&#x27;s remains were buried in a communal grave in Palma, it was impractical to repatriate them to New Zealand as per her wishes. In 1988, a bronze plaque with a depiction of Batten and text in English and Spanish was placed at the grave site.

==Legacy==
Batten is considered to be New Zealand&#x27;s most notable aviator and a better pilot than her contemporaries Amy Johnson and Amelia Earhart, particularly for navigation. The international terminal at the Auckland International Airport is named Jean Batten Terminal in her honour. A bronze statue of Batten was unveiled at the airport in November 1989, and the Percival Gull in which she made the first solo trip from England to New Zealand in 1936 is displayed in the terminal. She was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990.

A primary school founded in 1970 in Māngere is named after her; Batten, in her will, left it money for use as competition prizes. The historic Jean Batten building in Auckland, which occupies the small block between Fort and Shortland Streets, is also bounded by Jean Batten Place. The building has a Historic Place Category 1 rating by Heritage New Zealand. A street in her birthplace of Rotorua is also named for her. A bronze sculpture of Batten is located in the main terminal of Rotorua Regional Airport, and memorial panels are installed in the building. A small park in the middle of the city is named after her, and the Jean Batten Memorial is located there. At , Jean Batten Peak in the Ailsa Mountains of Fiordland was named for her in 1939; she had visited the nearby Walter Peak Station, close to Lake Wakatipu.

In September 2009, a street in the area of Palma where Batten died was renamed Carrer de Jean Batten (Jean Batten Street).

<doc id="774138" wikidata="Q272601" url="?curid=774138" title="Doreen Valiente">
<text>Doreen Edith Dominy Valiente (4 January 1922 – 1 September 1999) was an English Wiccan who was responsible for writing much of the early religious liturgy within the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. An author and poet, she also published five books dealing with Wicca and related esoteric subjects.

Born to a middle-class family in Surrey, Valiente began practising magic while a teenager. Working as a translator at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, she also married twice in this period. Developing her interest in occultism after the war, she began practising ceremonial magic with a friend while living in Bournemouth. Learning of Wicca, in 1953 she was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition by its founder, Gerald Gardner. Soon becoming the High Priestess of Gardner&#x27;s Bricket Wood coven, she helped him to produce or adapt many important scriptural texts for Wicca, such as &quot;The Witches Rune&quot; and the &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, which were incorporated into the early Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In 1957, a schism resulted in Valiente and her followers leaving Gardner in order to form their own short-lived coven. After investigating the Wiccan tradition of Charles Cardell, she was initiated into Raymond Howard&#x27;s Coven of Atho in 1963. She went on the following year to work with Robert Cochrane in his coven, the Clan of Tubal Cain, although she later broke from this group.

Eager to promote and defend her religion, she played a leading role in both the Witchcraft Research Association and then the Pagan Front during the 1960s and 1970s. That latter decade also saw her briefly involve herself in far right politics as well as becoming a keen ley hunter and proponent of Earth mysteries. As well as regularly writing articles on esoteric topics for various magazines, from the 1960s onward she authored a number of books on the subject of Wicca, as well as contributing to the publication of works by Wiccan friends Stewart Farrar, Janet Farrar, and Evan John Jones. In these works also she became an early advocate of the idea that anyone could practise Wicca without requiring initiation by a pre-existing Wiccan, while also contributing to and encouraging research into the religion&#x27;s early history. Living in Brighton during these years, she was a member of the Silver Malkin coven and worked with Ron Cook, who was both her partner and initiate. In her final years she served as patron of the Sussex-based Centre for Pagan Studies prior to her death from pancreatic cancer.

Valiente&#x27;s magical artefacts and papers were bequeathed to her last High Priest, John Belham-Payne, who donated them to a charitable trust, the Doreen Valiente Foundation, in 2011. Having had a significant influence in the history of Wicca, she is widely revered in the Wiccan community as &quot;the Mother of Modern Witchcraft&quot;, and has been the subject of two biographies.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1922–1952===
Valiente was born Doreen Edith Dominy on 4 January 1922 in the London outer suburb of Colliers Wood, Mitcham, Surrey. Her father, Harry Dominy, was a civil engineer, and he lived with her mother Edith in Colliers Wood. Harry came from a Methodist background and Edith from a Congregationalist one, however Doreen was never baptised, as was the custom of the time, due to an argument that Edith had had with the local vicar. Doreen later claimed that she had not had a close or affectionate relationship with her parents, whom she characterised as highly conventional and heavily focused on social climbing. During her childhood they moved to Horley in Surrey, and it was there, according to her later account, that she had an early spiritual experience while staring at the Moon. From there her family moved to the West Country and then to the New Forest. In either late 1934 or 1935, Doreen&#x27;s mother left her father and took her to live with maternal relatives in Southampton. Valiente first began practising magic at age 13, performing a spell to prevent her mother being harassed by a co-worker; she came to believe that it had worked. Her early knowledge of magical practices may have derived from books that she found in the local library. Her parents were concerned by this behaviour and sent her to a convent school. She despised the school and left it at the age of 15, refusing to return. She had wanted to go to art school, but instead gained employment in a factory, before moving on to work as a clerk and typist at the Unemployment Assistance Board.

During the Second World War, she became a Foreign Office Civilian Temporary Senior Assistant Officer, in this capacity working as a translator at Bletchley Park. In relation to this work, she was also sent to South Wales, and it was there, in the town of Barry, that she met Joanis Vlachopolous, a Greek seaman in the Merchant Navy. Entering a relationship, they were married in East Glamorgan on 31 January 1941. However, in June 1941 he was serving aboard the &quot;Pandias&quot; when it was sunk by a U-boat off of the West African coast; he was declared missing in action and presumed deceased. Widowed, during 1942 and 1943 Valiente had a number of short-term jobs in Wales, which were possibly a cover for intelligence work.

After October 1943 she was transferred to the intelligence service&#x27;s offices in Berkeley Street in the Mayfair area of London, where she was involved in message decryption. In London she met and entered into a relationship with Casimiro Valiente, a Spaniard who had fled from the Spanish Civil War, where he had fought on the side of the Spanish Republican Army before later joining the French Foreign Legion, where he was wounded at the Battle of Narvik and evacuated to England. They were married on 29 May 1944 at St Pancras Registry Office. The couple moved to Bournemouth – where Doreen&#x27;s mother was then living – and here Casimiro worked as a chef. Valiente would later say that both she and her husband suffered racism after the war because of their foreign associations.

Developing an interest in occultism, she began practising ceremonial magic with a friend, &quot;Zerki&quot;, at his flat. She had obtained the magical regalia and notebooks of a recently deceased doctor, who had been a member of the Alpha et Omega, a splinter group of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and attempted to learn Hebrew, a language with uses in various forms of ceremonial magic. It was at this point that she selected &quot;Ameth&quot; as her magical name. She was particularly interested by John Symonds&#x27; book &quot;The Great Beast&quot;, which was a biography of the occultist Aleister Crowley, who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904, and following this she avidly read a copy of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot; which she found in a local library. Alongside these, she also had some practical experience with the esoteric religions of Spiritualism and Theosophy, having attended the services of a local Christian Spiritualist church in Charminster.

===Gerald Gardner and the Bricket Wood Coven: 1952–1957===
She had also become familiar with the idea of a pre-Christian witch-cult surviving into the modern period through the works of Charles Godfrey Leland, Margaret Murray, and Robert Graves, although believed that the religion was extinct. It was in autumn 1952 that she read an article by the reporter Allen Andrews in &quot;Illustrated&quot; magazine titled &quot;Witchcraft in Britain&quot;. Discussing the recent opening of the Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft in Castletown on the Isle of Man, it mentioned the museum&#x27;s director, Cecil Williamson, and its &quot;resident witch&quot;, Gerald Gardner.

Intrigued by the article, Valiente wrote a letter to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter eventually suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes (&quot;Dafo&quot;), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.

Gardner invited Valiente again to Woodford-Grimes&#x27;s house on Midsummer 1953, and it was here that he initiated her into Wicca in a ritual during which they stood before an altar and he read from his Book of Shadows. The three of them then set off to the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where they witnessed the Druids performing a ritual there. Gardner had lent a ritual sword which he owned to the Druids, who placed it within the monument&#x27;s Heel Stone during their rite. Valiente told her husband and mother about the visit to Stonehenge, but not about her initiation, of which, she feared, they would not have approved.

Later in the year, Gardner invited Valiente to visit him at his flat in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London, and it was there that she met the eight to ten members of his Bricket Wood coven, which met near St. Albans, north of London. She soon rose to become the coven&#x27;s High Priestess. The historian Ronald Hutton later commented that in doing so, she formed &quot;the second great creative partnership of [Gardner&#x27;s] life&quot; after that with Woodford-Grimes. Valiente recognised how much of the material in Gardner&#x27;s Book of Shadows was taken not from ancient sources as Gardner had initially claimed, but from the works of Crowley. She confronted Gardner with this; he claimed that the text he had received from the New Forest coven had been fragmentary, and he had had to fill much of it using various sources. She took the Book of Shadows, and with Gardner&#x27;s permission, rewrote much of it, cutting out a lot of sections that had come from Crowley, fearing that his infamous reputation would sully Wicca. In 1953 she wrote &quot;Queen of the Moon, Queen of the Stars&quot;, an invocation for use in a Yule ritual which was inspired by a Hebridean song found in the &quot;Carmina Gadelica&quot;. With Gardner she also wrote &quot;The Witches Rune&quot;, a chant for use while dancing in a circle. She rewrote much of the Charge of the Goddess, with Hutton characterising this act as &quot;her greatest single contribution to Wicca&quot;, for her version of the Charge became &quot;the principle expression of Wiccan spirituality&quot; in coming years.

Gardner spent his summers at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, and thus often relied on Valiente to deal with his affairs in Southern England. He sent her to meet the occult artist Austin Osman Spare when he wanted some talismans produced by the latter. Spare subsequently described Valiente as &quot;a myopic stalky nymph... harmless and a little tiresome&quot; in a letter that he wrote to Kenneth Grant. At Gardner&#x27;s prompting, she also met with the occultist Gerald Yorke, who was interested in learning about Wicca; Gardner insisted that she lie to Yorke by informing him that she was from a longstanding family of hereditary Wiccan practitioners. She also aided him in preparing his second non-fiction book about Wicca, &quot;The Meaning of Witchcraft&quot;, focusing in particular on those sections refuting the sensationalist accusations of the tabloid press.

However Gardner&#x27;s increasing desire for publicity, much of it ending up negative, caused conflict with Valiente and other members of his coven like Ned Grove and Derek Boothby. She felt that in repeatedly communicating with the press, he was compromising the coven&#x27;s security. She was also not enthusiastic about two young people whom Gardner brought into the coven, Jack L. Bracelin and his girlfriend &#x27;Dayonis&#x27;, stating that &quot;a more qualid pair of spivs it would be hard to find indeed&quot;. Two factions emerged within the coven; Valiente led a broadly anti-publicity group, while Gardner led a pro-publicity one. In 1957, Valiente and Grove drew up a list of &quot;Proposed Rules of the Craft&quot; which were partly designed to curtail Gardner&#x27;s publicity-seeking. From his home in the Isle of Man, he responded that this was not necessary for a series of rules already existed—at which point he produced the Wiccan Laws. These laws limited the control of the High Priestess, which angered Valiente, who later realised that Gardner had simply made them up in response to her own Proposed Laws. In summer 1957, the coven split. According to Valiente, she and her followers &quot;had had enough of the Gospel according to St. Gerald; but we still believed that the real traditional witchcraft lived&quot;. According to Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White, &quot;Wicca had experienced its first great schism&quot;.

===Robert Cochrane and &quot;Where Witchcraft Lives&quot;: 1957–1969===
After breaking from Gardner&#x27;s Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, still following the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner&#x27;s. However, this coven failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, along with her husband and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got back in touch with Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.

After her mother&#x27;s death in August 1962, Valiente felt that she could be more open about being a Wiccan herself.
Eager to spread information about Wicca throughout Britain, she also began to interact with press, sending a 1962 letter to the Spiritualist newspaper &quot;Psychic News&quot;, and in 1964 being interviewed for her involvement with Wicca by Brighton&#x27;s &quot;Evening Argus&quot;. During the 1960s, she began producing articles about Wicca and other esoteric subjects on a regular basis, for such esoteric magazines as &quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Fate&quot;, and &quot;Prediction&quot;. In this capacity, she also began to make appearances on television and radio. She also involved herself in the newly formed Witchcraft Research Association (WRA), becoming its second President after the resignation of Sybil Leek. Valiente&#x27;s letter of welcome was included in the first issue of the WRA&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Pentagram&quot;, published in August 1964, while she also gave a speech at the WRA&#x27;s Halloween dinner in October. It was at the speech that Valiente proclaimed the Wiccan Rede; this was its first public appearance in a recognisable form, with Doyle White arguing that it was Valiente herself who both created and named the Rede. It was through the WRA that Valiente came to communicate with the journalist Justine Glass, who was then conducting research for her book &quot;Witchcraft, the Sixth Sense, and Us&quot;.

Valiente began visiting local libraries and archives in order to investigate the history of witchcraft in Sussex. On the basis of this research, the esoteric press Aquarian published her first book, &quot;Where Witchcraft Lives&quot;, in 1962. Just as Gardner had done in his book &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot;, here Valiente did not identify as a practising Wiccan, but as an interested scholar of witchcraft. It contained her own research into the history and folklore of witchcraft in her county of Sussex, which she had collected both from archival research and from the published work of the historian L&#x27;Estrange Ewen. It interpreted this evidence in light of the discredited theories of Margaret Murray, which claimed that a pre-Christian religious movement had survived to the present, when it had emerged as Wicca. Hutton later related that it was &quot;one of the first three books to be published on the subject&quot; of Wicca, and that the &quot;remarkable feature of the book is that it remains, until this date [2010], the only one produced by a prominent modern witch that embodies actual original research into the records of the trials of people accused of the crime of witchcraft during the early modern period.&quot; In 1966, Valiente then produced a manuscript for a book titled &quot;I am a Witch!&quot;, a collection of poems with a biographical introduction; however, it was never published, publishers not believing that it would be commercially viable.

Valiente learned of the non-Gardnerian Wiccan Charles Cardell from a 1958 article, and subsequently struck up a correspondence with him. Cardell suggested that they pool their respective traditions together, but Valiente declined the offer, expressing some scepticism regarding Cardell&#x27;s motives and conduct. In 1962, Valiente began a correspondence course run by Raymond Howard, a former associate of Cardell&#x27;s; this course instructed her in a Wiccan tradition known as the Coven of Atho. At Halloween 1963 she was then initiated into the Coven of Atho in a ritual overseen by Howard, entering the lowest rank of the course, that of &#x27;Sarsen&#x27;, and beginning to copy the teachings that she received into notebooks, where she was able to identify many of the sources from which Howard had drawn upon in fashioning his tradition.

In 1964, Valiente was introduced to the Pagan witch Robert Cochrane by a mutual friend, the ceremonial magician William G. Gray, who had met him at a gathering at Glastonbury Tor held by the Brotherhood of the Essenes. Although sceptical of Cochrane&#x27;s claims to have come from a hereditary family of witches, she was impressed by his charisma, his desire to avoid publicity, and his emphasis on working outdoors. Valiente was invited to join Cochrane&#x27;s coven, the Clan of Tubal Cain, becoming its sixth member. 
However, she became dissatisfied with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even at one point calling for &quot;a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians&quot;, at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she &quot;rose up and challenged him in the presence of the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a &#x27;Night of the Long Knives&#x27; was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had better things to do&quot;. Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem &quot;Elegy for a Dead Witch&quot; in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.

===The Pagan Front, National Front, and further publications: 1970–1984===

Living in Brighton, Valiente took up employment in a branch of the Boots pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, &quot;Power of the Witch&quot;, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, she was involved in the founding of the Pagan Front, a British pressure group that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she who developed the three principles that came to be central to the Pagan Front&#x27;s interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.

In April 1972 her husband Casimiro died; he had never taken an interest in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been an unhappy relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had to move as the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s tower block of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, a member of the apartment block&#x27;s residents&#x27; committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her working partner. Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.

During the early 1970s, Valiente became a member of a far right white nationalist political party, the National Front, for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente&#x27;s biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party&#x27;s nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that she might have hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also became a member of another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the National Front to lapse, sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party&#x27;s opposition to women&#x27;s liberation, gay rights, and sex education, all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain&#x27;s intelligence agencies.

It was also in the early 1970s that she read John Michell&#x27;s &quot;The View Over Atlantis&quot; and was heavily influenced by it, embracing Michell&#x27;s view that there were ley lines across the British landscape that channelled earth energies. Inspired, she began searching for ley lines in the area around Brighton. She also began subscribing to &quot;The Ley Hunter&quot; magazine, for which she authored several articles and book reviews. Valiente came to see the public emergence of Wicca as a sign of the Age of Aquarius, arguing that the religion should ally with the feminist and environmentalist movements in order to establish a better future for the planet.

In 1973, the publishing company Robert Hale brought out Valiente&#x27;s second book, &quot;An ABC of Witchcraft&quot;, in which she provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente&#x27;s &quot;Natural Magic&quot;, a discussion of what she believed to be the magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published &quot;Witchcraft for Tomorrow&quot;, in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, &quot;The Witch Ball&quot;, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.

In 1978, Valiente struck up a friendship with the Alexandrian Wiccans Stewart Farrar and Janet Farrar, who were then living in Ireland. With the Farrars, she agreed to publish the original contents of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, in order to combat the garbled variants that had been released by Cardell and Lady Sheba. The original Gardnerian material appeared in the Farrars&#x27; two books, &quot;Eight Sabbats for Witches&quot; and &quot;The Witches&#x27; Way&quot; (1984), both published with Hale at Valiente&#x27;s recommendation. In these works, Valiente and the Farrars identified differences between early recensions of the Book and identified many of the older sources that it drew upon. Hutton believed that later scholars such as himself had to be &quot;profoundly grateful&quot; to the trio for undertaking this task, while Doyle White opined that these publications, alongside &quot;Witchcraft for Tomorrow&quot;, helped contribute to &quot;the democratisation of Wicca&quot; by enabling any reader to set themselves up as a Wiccan practitioner. As an appendix to &quot;The Witches&#x27; Way&quot; she also published the result of her investigations into &quot;Old Dorothy&quot;, the woman whom Gardner had claimed had been involved with the New Forest coven. The academic historian Jeffrey Burton Russell had recently suggested that Gardner invented &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; as an attempt to hide the fact that he had invented Wicca himself. Valiente sought to disprove this, discovering that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; was a real person: Dorothy Clutterbuck. Valiente biographer Jonathan Tapsell described it as &quot;one of Doreen&#x27;s greatest known moments&quot;.

===Autobiography and final years: 1985–1999===

In the mid-1980s, Valiente began writing an autobiography in which she focused on her own place within Wiccan history. It would be published by Hale in 1989 as &quot;The Rebirth of Witchcraft&quot;. In this work she did not dismiss the Murrayite witch-cult theory, but she did undermine the belief that Wicca was the survival of it by highlighting the various false claims made by Gardner, Cochrane, and Sanders, instead emphasising what she perceived as the religion&#x27;s value for the modern era. She also provided a foreword for &quot;Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed&quot;, a book published in 1990 by Hale. It had been written by Evan John Jones, a former member of the Clan of Tubal Cain who also lived in Brighton. Heselton has expressed the view that Valiente likely did more than this, and that she wrote a number of the chapters herself.
As Valiente became better known, she came to correspond with a wide range of people within the Pagan and esoteric communities. Through this, she met the American Wiccan Starhawk – whom she greatly admired – on one of the latter&#x27;s visits to Britain. She also communicated with the American Wiccan and scholar of Pagan studies Aidan A. Kelly during his investigations into the early Gardnerian liturgies. She disagreed with Kelly that there had been no New Forest coven and that Gardner had therefore invented Wicca, instead insisting that Gardner had stumbled on a coven of the Murrayite witch-cult.

In 1997 Valiente discovered the Centre for Pagan Studies (CFPS), a Pagan organisation based in the Sussex hamlet of Maresfield that had been established in 1995. Befriending its founders, John Belham-Payne and his wife Julie Belham-Payne, she became the centre&#x27;s patron and gave several lectures for the group. In 1997 Cooke died, leaving Valiente grief-stricken. Her final public speech was at the Pagan Federation&#x27;s annual conference, held at Croydon&#x27;s Fairfield Halls in November 1997; here she praised the work of early twentieth-century occultist Dion Fortune and urged the Wiccan community to accept homosexuals. Valiente&#x27;s health was deteriorating as she was diagnosed first with diabetes and then terminal pancreatic cancer; increasingly debilitated, John Belham-Payne and two of her friends became her primary carers. In her last few days she was moved to the Sackville Nursing Home, there requesting that Belham-Payne publish an anthology of her poems after her death. She died on 1 September 1999, with Belham-Payne at her side. CFPS&#x27; barn in Maresfield, where an all-night vigil was held; those invited included Ralph Harvey, and Ronald Hutton. After this Pagan rite was completed, her coffin was cremated at Brighton&#x27;s Woodvale crematorium, in an intentionally low-key service with John Belham-Payne, Doreen&#x27;s last High priest as celebrant for the funeral. As per her wishes, Valiente&#x27;s ashes were scattered in Sussex woodland. Her magical artefacts and manuscripts, including her Book of Shadows, were bequeathed to John Belham-Payne. Her book of poems was published posthumously in 2000, followed by an enlarged second edition in 2014.

==Personality==
Hutton characterised Valiente as &quot;a handsome woman of striking, dark-haired, aquiline looks, possessed of a strong, enquiring, candid, and independent personality, and a gift for poetry and ritual&quot;. Belham-Payne noted that Valiente was &quot;very tall, rather reserved and preferred to be in the background&quot;, while Doreen Valiente Foundation Trustee, Ashley Mortimer described her as &quot;sensible, practical, decent, honest and, perhaps most importantly, pragmatic&quot;. The writer Leo Ruickbie described her as &quot;a plain, owlishly bespectacled woman with a slight stoop and a friendly twinkle in her eye&quot;. Throughout her life, Valiente remained a believer in the Murrayite Witch-Cult theory despite its having been academically discredited by the 1970s.

Valiente had a strong dislike of unexpected visitors, and would often refuse to answer the door to those who knocked unannounced.
She was an avid fan of football, and closely followed the World Cup, refusing to open the door to any visitors while she was watching the competition on television. She also enjoyed betting on horse races.

==Reception and legacy==

Within the Wiccan community, Valiente has become internationally known as the &quot;Mother of Modern Witchcraft&quot; or &quot;Mother of Wica&quot;, although she herself disliked this moniker. Heselton believed that Valiente&#x27;s influence on Wicca was &quot;profound and far-reaching&quot;, while Ruickbie characterised her as Gardner&#x27;s &quot;most gifted acolyte&quot;. Doyle White stated that an argument could be made that Gardner would &quot;never have been anywhere near as successful&quot; in promoting Wicca had he not had Valiente&#x27;s help.
In 2016, Heselton expressed the view that Valiente was best known for her books, which are &quot;still some of the most readable on the subject&quot; of Wicca, further highlighting that they often appeared on Wiccan reading lists. The ritual liturgies that Valiente composed also proved highly influential within the Wiccan religion and constitute a core element of her legacy.

Kelly asserted that Valiente &quot;deserves credit for having helped transform the Craft from being the hobby of a handful of eccentric Brits into being an international religious movement&quot;. Describing her as &quot;a major personality in the development&quot; of Wicca, Hutton also expressed the view that &quot;her enduring greatness lay in the very fact that she was so completely and strong-mindedly dedicated to finding and declaring her own truth, in a world in which the signposts to it were themselves in a state of almost complete confusion&quot;.

===Events and organisations===
In 2009, the CFPS organised &quot;A Day for Doreen&quot;, an event in central London dedicated to Valiente. Sixteen speakers from within the Wiccan and Pagan community came to talk at the event, which was a sell-out. On 21 June 2013, the Centre For Pagan Studies unveiled a blue plaque at the Tyson Place tower block, Valiente&#x27;s final home. Julie Belham-Payne performed the unveiling at the ceremony, and a speech was given by Denise Cobb, the Mayor of Brighton. It had been preceded by an open solstice ritual in Brighton&#x27;s Steine Gardens, led by Ralph Harvey.

Following Valiente&#x27;s death, John Belham-Payne received offers of substantial amounts of money from buyers seeking to purchase parts of her collection. In 2011 he entrusted the collection of artefacts that he had inherited from Valiente to the newly established the Doreen Valiente Foundation. A charitable trust, the Foundation was designed to prevent the collection being broken up and sold, moreover allowing for future Wiccans and researchers to start &quot;delving into it, protecting it, making it accessible and available for people to research, learn from and enjoy.&quot; John Belham-Payne became the group&#x27;s chairman, while Ashley Mortimer, Brian Botham, and Trish Botham were appointed as trustees.

Aside from Valiente&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Rebirth of Witchcraft&quot;, the first published biography of Valiente was written by Jonathan Tapsell and published as &quot;Ameth: The Life and Times of Doreen Valiente&quot; by Avalonia Books in 2013. Doyle White characterised this volume as being &quot;all-too-brief&quot;. Belham-Payne initially considered writing a biography of Valiente, but feeling that he was not academically qualified to do so, he commissioned Heselton – who had previously published several books on Gardner – to do so, publishing the result as &quot;Doreen Valiente: Witch&quot; through his Doreen Valiente Foundation in 2016. It held its launch party at the esoteric-themed bookstore, Treadwell&#x27;s, in central London, in February 2016, shortly after Belham-Payne&#x27;s death.

<text>Johann II (Johann Maria Franz Placidus; 5 October 1840 – 11 February 1929), nicknamed the Good (), was Prince of Liechtenstein from 12 November 1858 until his death in 1929.

His reign of 70 years and 91 days is the third-longest of any sovereign monarch in European history, after those of King Louis XIV and Queen Elizabeth II respectively, and fourth-longest overall for which exact dates are known (after King Louis, Queen Elizabeth, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej respectively).

==Early life==

Johann II was the elder son of Aloys II, Prince of Liechtenstein and Countess Franziska Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau. He ascended to the throne shortly after his 18th birthday. Until he was surpassed by Elizabeth II on 9 May 2022, his reign had been the longest precisely documented tenure of any European monarch since antiquity in which a regent (that is, a regent serving in place of an underage sovereign) was never employed. Although his mother acted as his regent from 10 February 1859 to November 1860, she was not the regent for a minor, but was appointed by her son to fulfil his duties because he wished to finish his education before he began his rule.

==Law and reform==
In 1862, Johann II issued Liechtenstein&#x27;s first constitution, which was heavily influenced by the likes of Vorarlberg. After World War I and due to significant popular demand, Johann II granted a new constitution, which was ratified on 5 October 1921. It granted considerable political rights to common Liechtensteiners and made the principality a constitutional monarchy. The constitution has survived but with revisions, most notably in 2003.

==Foreign affairs==
Liechtenstein left the German Confederation in 1866. Not long afterward, the Liechtenstein Army was abolished as it was regarded as an unnecessary expense.

In 1867, Alexander II of Russia had offered Johann the purchase of Russian Alaska, but he refused as he believed the territory was useless.

Johann II somewhat cooled relations with Liechtenstein&#x27;s traditional ally, Austria-Hungary and its successor states, to forge closer relations with Switzerland, particularly after World War I. Liechtenstein was neutral during the war, which broke Liechtenstein&#x27;s alliance with Austria-Hungary and led it to go into a customs union with Switzerland. In 1924, late in Johann&#x27;s reign, the Swiss franc became Liechtenstein&#x27;s official currency.

==Patron of arts==
Johann II, an outstanding art connoisseur and a generous patron, added much to the Liechtenstein Princely Collections. Although considered a prominent patron of the arts and sciences during his long reign, Johann II was also considered to be rather unsociable and did not participate in social events. Rarely did he show up in his magnificent Vienna residences, Liechtenstein City Palace and Liechtenstein Garden Palace. He also never assumed any tasks in Austrian politics or the Austrian military, and he never married or had any children like several other members of his family.

From 1884, he rebuilt Liechtenstein Castle, the ancestral seat of his family near Vienna, which had fallen into ruins. Between 1905 and 1920, Schloss Vaduz was renovated and expanded. Like all of his ancestors he never lived in the principality of Liechtenstein, but on the vast Austrian and Moravian estates of the House of Liechtenstein which were 7.5 times the total area of the Principality itself. His main homes were the castles of Lednice and Valtice (German names: Eisgrub and Feldsberg) in what is today the Czech Republic (then part of Austria-Hungary with the Austrian-Bohemian border running through the park between the two castles). The local administration of the Principality was overseen by a governor, and the government office was located at the prince&#x27;s seat. It was not until the German occupation of the Czech lands at the beginning of World War II that the residence was moved to Vaduz.

== Declining health and death ==
As Johann entered his later years, his eyesight began to decline rapidly and on 12 November 1928, he underwent surgery to remove cataracts. He died on 11 February 1929 and was succeeded by his younger brother Franz I.

==Honours==
* Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order, &quot;1860&quot; (Kingdom of Hanover)
* Knight of the Golden Fleece, &quot;1862&quot; (Austrian Empire)
* Grand Cross of St. Stephen, &quot;1896&quot; (Austria-Hungary)
* Knight of St. Hubert, &quot;1882&quot; (Kingdom of Bavaria)
* Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion (Sovereign Military Order of Malta)

<text>Abbé Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre (1752, Aveyron – 20 September 1804, Saint-Geniez-d&#x27;Olt) was a French zoologist who contributed sections on cetaceans, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects to the &quot;Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique&quot;. He is also notable as the first scientist to study the feral child Victor of Aveyron.

Bonnaterre is credited with identifying about 25 new species of fish, and assembled illustrations of about 400 in his encyclopedia work.

He was the first scientist to study Victor, the wild child of Aveyron, whose life inspired François Truffaut for his film &quot;The Wild Child&quot;.

<doc id="774155" wikidata="Q348587" url="?curid=774155" title="Antipope John XVI">
<text>John XVI (; born ; ; ) was an antipope from 997 to 998.

==Biography==
John was of Greek descent and was a native of Rossano in Calabria, southern Italy. The region was at the time a territory of the Byzantine Empire, while John was the chaplain of the Greek-born Empress Theophanu, wife of Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. Twice he acted as Imperial chancellor in Italy for Otto, in 980–982, whereupon he was appointed Abbot of Nonantola. He was the godfather of the imperial couple&#x27;s son, the future Emperor Otto III. He was his tutor when he was seven (987). By the Empress&#x27;s persuasion, John was appointed Bishop of Piacenza, and he was sent to Constantinople to accompany home a Byzantine princess for the younger Otto. After Otto II&#x27;s death, the youthful Otto III came to the aid of Pope John XV in 996, to put down the rebellion of a faction led by the rich and powerful Roman nobleman Crescentius the Younger. Otto III stopped to be acclaimed King of Lombardy at Pavia, and failed to reach Rome before the Pope died. Once in Rome, Otto III engineered the election of his cousin Bruno of Carinthia as Pope Gregory V, and the new pontiff then crowned Otto III emperor on 21 May 996.

Once Otto III had returned to Germany, the faction headed by Crescentius II violently unseated Gregory V and, with the active support of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II, acclaimed John as Pope John XVI. A synod of the Western bishops held in 997 at the Imperial capital in Italy, Pavia, made no mention of John, but excommunicated Crescentius the Younger.

Otto III firmly put down Crescentius II&#x27;s uprising in February 998 after advancing once more into Rome. John XVI fled, but the Emperor&#x27;s troops pursued and captured him, cut off his nose and ears, cut out his tongue, broke his fingers and blinded him, that he might not write, and publicly degraded him before Otto III and Gregory V by being forced to ride through the streets of Rome seated backwards on a donkey. At the intercession of Saint Nilus the Younger, one of his countrymen, his life was spared: he was sent to the monastery of Fulda, in Germany, where he died about 1001.

John&#x27;s consent to be enthroned as pope against the claims of Gregory can be seen as a manipulation of the constant political struggles by the Roman nobles against Frankish power, accruing to the advantage of Byzantine influence against the widening of Frankish power in Rome, where Gregory was the first German pontiff.

<doc id="774156" wikidata="Q951444" url="?curid=774156" title="Nana Saheb Peshwa II">
<text>Nana Saheb Peshwa II (19 May 1824 – after 1857), born Dhondu Pant, was an Indian aristocrat and fighter who led the Siege of Cawnpore (Kanpur) during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the East India Company. As the adopted son of the exiled Maratha Peshwa, Baji Rao II, Nana Saheb believed he was entitled to a pension from the Company. However, after being denied recognition under Lord Dalhousie&#x27;s doctrine of lapse, he joined the 1857 rebellion and took charge of the rebels in Kanpur. He forced the British garrison in Kanpur to surrender and subsequently ordered the killing of the survivors, briefly gaining control of the city. After the British recaptured Kanpur, Nana Saheb disappeared, and conflicting accounts surround his later life and death.

==Early life==
Nana Saheb was born on 19 May 1824 as Nana Govind Dhondu Pant, to Narayan Bhat and Ganga Bai. After the Marathas were defeated in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the East India Company exiled Peshwa Baji Rao II to Bithoor (near Kanpur), but allowed him to maintain a large establishment, partly funded by a British pension. Nana Saheb&#x27;s father, a well-educated Deccani Brahmin, had travelled with his family from the Western Ghats to serve as a court official for the exiled Peshwa. He married the sister of one of the Peshwa&#x27;s wives, with whom he had two sons.

As Baji Rao II had no biological sons, he adopted Nana Saheb and his younger brother, Bala Saheb, in 1827. Nana Saheb&#x27;s childhood companions included Tatya Tope, Azimullah Khan, and Manikarnika Tambe, the future Rani of Jhansi. Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb&#x27;s fencing master, was the son of Pandurang Rao Tope, a significant noble in the Peshwa&#x27;s court who had accompanied his sovereign into exile. Azimullah Khan later became Nana Saheb&#x27;s secretary and dewan.

==Inheritance==

At the time, the British East India Company had absolute, imperial administrative control over many regions across the subcontinent. The doctrine of lapse was an annexation policy devised by Lord Dalhousie, the British Governor-General of India between 1848 and 1856. According to this doctrine, any princely state or territory under the paramountcy of the Company would automatically be annexed if the ruler was either &quot;manifestly incompetent&quot; or died without a direct heir. The doctrine overturned the long-established right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to select a successor, with the British reserving the power to decide the competency of potential rulers. The policy was widely resented by Indians as illegitimate.

Although the Peshwa&#x27;s domains had been annexed in 1818, prior to the implementation of the doctrine, upon the death of Baji Rao II, the Company invoked the doctrine to deny Nana Saheb the pension previously granted, as he was an adopted son. Baji Rao had been provided with an annual pension of 800,000 Rupees (£80,000 at the time), along with tax-free lands, but these provisions were rescinded after his death. Nana Saheb repeatedly appealed for the restoration of the pension and funds, initially using the pro-Indian barrister John Lang to appeal to the authorities in India. Following the failure in India, he sent his advocate, Azimullah Khan and an entourage, to London to plead his case. However, this attempt too was unsuccessful.

== Role in the 1857 uprising ==

The town of Bithur was 13 miles northwest of Kanpur. In the well-furnished palace which he had inherited from his adopted father, the Nana Sahib entertained British officers and frequently gave parties. He was known to be a generous host and so was well-liked by the British officers. In April 1857, the Nana went on a tour of the neighbouring cantonments, ostensibly on a pilgrimage. He was well received in Lucknow by Sir Henry Lawrence, however he suddenly cut short the visit and returned to Kanpur. Major General Hugh Massey Wheeler trusted the Nana, since his wife was related to Nana&#x27;s family. So when reports, that the disbanded troops of the 19th Native Infantry were lavishly entertained by the Nana whilst they were passing through Bithur in late April 1857, reached the British, Gen. Massey took no notice. By May 1857, there were disturbances and arson attacks in the city. Despite the direct and blunt warnings regarding Nana&#x27;s intentions issued to the British by sympathetic Indians, such as the banker Nanak Chand, the Nana was invited by the British to take part in discussions relating to the defence of the cantonments. 

The Nana Sahib expressed loyalty to Company officials in Kanpur and even offered to protect the Europeans in the city. It was planned that Nana Saheb would assemble a force of 1,500 soldiers to fight the rebels, in case the rebellion spread to Kanpur. Gen. Wheeler put the treasury in charge of Nana&#x27;s own troops. Gen. Wheeler was so confident that there would be no action at Kanpur that he even sent a detachment to Lucknow.

The British had two potential locations where they could take refuge in the event of a rebellion. There was a fortified magazine with high and thick walls 3 miles upstream of the cantonment, however it did not have easy access to water. Therefore, instead of fortifying the magazine north of the depot with adequate arms and ammunition, the British barricaded themselves in two large, yet poorly fortified barrack buildings, one of masonry and another with a thatched roof, near the road to Allahabad, because there was a well near the buildings. They had started constructing a masonry wall, but the wall was only four feet tall at the start of the conflict and was not bulletproof. Sixty years after the events, a large, fortified, Mughal-era underground room was discovered at the barracks&#x27; site, the presence of which seems to have been unknown to both the British and Nana Saheb in 1857. 

===Attack on Wheeler&#x27;s entrenchment===
On 6 June 1857, the East India Company forces at Kanpur rebelled and the British contingent took refuge at the barracks in the northern part of the town. The Company forces had expected the rebels to leave for Delhi, so were unprepared for a lengthy defence. 

The barracks housed around 900 Europeans, Eurasians, and Indians, of which only 210 were European soldiers, joined by around 100 armed civilians. The British had five 9-pounders, one brass 3-pounder, and a mortar. Initially, General Wheeler was confident enough to send part of his garrison to reinforce Lucknow. Amid the prevailing chaos, Nana Saheb and his forces entered the British magazine in the northern part of Kanpur. The soldiers of the 53rd Native Infantry, guarding the magazine, believed Nana was there to protect it on behalf of the Company. On 4 June, the Company sepoys of the 1st, 53rd, and 56th Native Infantry regiments and the 2nd Cavalry regiment rebelled, looted the treasury, and, as expected, left Kanpur for Delhi. 

Nana Sahib, who hitherto had officially been uncommitted to the cause or was officially pro-British, took control of the Company treasury. With the treasury held by his forces, once inside, Nana Saheb officially declared his participation in the rebellion against the Company. On the advice of Azimullah Khan, the Nana rushed up the Grand Trunk Road on his state elephant. He caught up with rebel Company soldiers at Kalyanpur, who were headed to Delhi to meet Bahadur Shah II. Nana persuaded them to return to Kanpur and assist him in defeating the British by promising to double their pay and reward them with gold. He declared his intention to restore the Maratha Confederacy under the Peshwa tradition, with plans to capture Kanpur. He appointed Jwala Prasad as brigadier of the new army, his elder brother Baba Bhutt as the judge of Kanpur and Azimulla Khan as the collector. 

On 5 June 1857, Nana Saheb sent a letter to General Hugh Wheeler, informing him to expect an attack at 10 am the next day. On 6 June, his forces, including the rebel soldiers, attacked the Company entrenchment at 10:30 am. The British, caught off guard, defended themselves as the attackers hesitated to enter the entrenchment, for fear of mined trenches. The British held out for three weeks with little water and food, losing many to sunstroke and dehydration. On 7 June, the rebels brought large calibre guns, and the bombardment of the entrenchment began. In the subsequent battle, Nana Saheb&#x27;s eldest son, Baan Rao, was killed.

As Nana Saheb&#x27;s attack on the British garrison became known, more rebel sepoys joined him. By 10 June, Nana led around 12,000 to 15,000 Indian soldiers. The first week of the siege saw Nana&#x27;s forces establish firing positions from nearby buildings. Captain John Moore of the defending forces launched retaliatory night sorties. Nana Saheb then withdrew his headquarters to Savada House, two miles away. On 13 June, the rebels set fire to one of the thatched barracks used as a hospital and charged the British lines, but their charge was repelled by British grapeshot.

Sniper fire and bombardment continued until 23 June 1857. A prophecy about the downfall of East India Company rule exactly 100 years after the Battle of Plassey motivated over 4,000 rebel soldiers to launch a major attack on 23 June, beginning with a cavalry charge. General Wheeler waited until the cavalry was 50 yards away before opening fire with grapeshot. The infantry, using cotton bales for cover, approached within 100 yards of the perimeter but failed to breach the entrenchment and had to retreat. On the same day, a 9-pound shot decapitated Gordon Wheeler, General Wheeler&#x27;s son.

Meanwhile, in the city, those Indians associated with the British were killed, and sectarian violence erupted, partly inflamed by Baba Bhatt, Nana&#x27;s elder brother, who had ordered his soldiers to kill Muslim butchers who were caught slaughtering cows. The situation was defused to some extent by Azimulla Khan. On 25 June, a Eurasian prisoner named Mrs Jacobi, approached the entrenchment with an offer of honourable surrender and safe passage to Allahabad. Facing dwindling provisions and with no reinforcements, following discussions with his remaining officers, Wheeler accepted the offer on 26 June, leading to a truce and negotiations with Azimulla Khan and Jawala Prasad, commander of Nana’s cavalry. In accordance with the negotiations, the garrison would be allowed to march out with their side arms and ammunition but had to leave the artillery behind.

===Satichaura Ghat massacre===
On the morning of 27 June, Wheeler&#x27;s column, consisting primarily of unarmed civilians, including more than 300 women and children, emerged from the entrenchment. Nana sent a number of carts, dolis, and elephants to enable the women, children, and sick to proceed to the riverbanks. The Company officers and military men were allowed to take their arms and ammunition with them and were escorted by nearly the entire rebel army. They reached the Satichaura Ghat by 8 am. At this ghat, Nana Saheb had arranged around 40 boats, belonging to a boatman named Hardev Mallah, for their departure to Allahabad.

However, Nana Saheb&#x27;s rebels had deliberately placed the boats as high in the mud as possible to delay the boarding, making it difficult for the Europeans to drift the boats away. Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and managed to set their boat adrift. At this point, three shots were fired from the direction of Nana Saheb&#x27;s camp, signalling the start of the attack. The Indian boatmen jumped overboard and began swimming toward the banks. However, according to Mowbray Thompson, one of the few survivors of the massacre, before the boatmen jumped overboard, they had &quot;contrived to secrete burning charcoal in the thatch of most of the boats,&quot; which set some of the boats ablaze. Though there is controversy surrounding what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat, the departing Europeans were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and most were either killed or captured.

Some of the Company officers later claimed that Nana had intentionally placed the boats high in the mud to cause delays. They also claimed that Nana had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the Europeans. Although the East India Company later accused Nana of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no definitive evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion rather than a plan implemented by Nana and his associates. Nevertheless, reports of sniper fire from cannons pre-positioned along the riverbank might suggest pre-planning.

Amid the prevailing confusion at the Satichaura Ghat, Nana&#x27;s general, Tatya Tope, allegedly ordered the 2nd Bengal Cavalry unit and some artillery units to open fire on the Europeans. The rebel cavalry sowars moved into the water to kill the remaining Company soldiers with swords and pistols. The surviving men were killed, while women and children were captured, as Nana did not approve of their killing. Around 120 women and children were taken prisoner and escorted to Savada House, Nana Saheb&#x27;s headquarters during the siege. Two ladies, Mrs. Lett and Mrs. Bradshaw, hid among the grass, disguised themselves, and escaped at night. One boat also escaped, and the boaters found refuge with Raja Dirigibijah Singh, who protected them and later had them escorted to the British lines.

The rebel soldiers pursued Wheeler&#x27;s boat, which was slowly drifting to safer waters. After some firing, the European men on the boat decided to fly the white flag. They were escorted off the boat and taken back to Savada House. The surviving men were seated on the ground as Nana&#x27;s soldiers prepared to kill them. The women insisted they would die with their husbands but were pulled away. Nana granted the British chaplain Rev. Cockey&#x27;s request to read prayers before they were killed. The British were initially wounded by gunfire and then killed with swords. The women and children were taken to Savada House to be reunited with their remaining colleagues.

===Bibighar massacre===
On the advice of astrologers, Nana was consecrated as Baji Rao&#x27;s heir on 1 July amid much fanfare and a 21-gun salute. Meanwhile, the surviving women and children, along with their Indian supporters—around 120 in number—were moved from Savada House to Bibighar (&quot;the House of the Ladies&quot;), a villa-type house in Kanpur. They were later joined by other women and children, the survivors from Wheeler&#x27;s boat. Another group of women and children from Fatehgarh, as well as some other captive women, were also confined in Bibighar. In total, there were around 200 women and children there. An Indian ayurvedic doctor was allowed to attend to the captives and recorded thirty-six fatalities (18 British women, 17 children, and 1 Hindu nurse), possibly due to cholera, in the first week of their capture. Following this, the captives were allowed out of the building twice a day under guard. In the meantime, Nana&#x27;s army had swelled to over 20,000, and the billeting of these troops caused unhappiness among the citizens of Kanpur; sectarian tensions were increasing as well.

Nana Saheb deputed a tawaif (nautch girl) named Hussaini Khanum (also known as Hussaini Begum) to care for the survivors. He decided to use these prisoners as leverage in bargaining with the East India Company. On 9 July, Nana received news that a company of 700 under the command of Major Sydenham Renaud was advancing along the Grand Trunk Road, indiscriminately punishing Indian villages en route. Further Company forces, consisting of around 1,200 British soldiers, 150 Sikh soldiers, 30 irregular cavalry, and 6 cannons, had set out from Allahabad under the command of General Henry Havelock to retake Cawnpore and Lucknow. Havelock&#x27;s forces were later joined by those under Major Renaud and James Neil. Nana demanded that the East India Company forces under Havelock and Neil retreat to Allahabad. However, the Company forces advanced relentlessly towards Cawnpore. Nana sent an army to check the advance of Major Renaud&#x27;s forces, but they encountered General Havelock&#x27;s army at Futtehpore on 12 July. The rebels could not counter the British artillery or the Enfield rifles, which had an accurate range of 900 yards and soon gave way. Tatya Tope had an elephant shot under him by a cannon roundshot, and General Havelock&#x27;s forces emerged victorious, capturing the town with few casualties.

Nana then sent another force under the command of his brother, Bala Rao. On 15 July, Bala fortified his positions at Aong behind walled gardens, with two cannons covering the route of the British. The British mounted patrol was aware of this, leading to the Battle of Aong. Major Renaud charged at the head of his forces, was wounded in the thigh, and later succumbed to his injuries. The British artillery cleared the rebel artillery, forcing Bala to retreat beyond the Pandu River and secure the stone bridge across it. Sympathetic Indian villagers informed Havelock of this, and he marched his forces 16 miles under the sun, flanking the bridge from the village of Maharajpore. In the meantime, Nana Sahib had arrived with more artillery to bolster his forces. The British advanced under heavy fire. Havelock&#x27;s son, Henry, rode his horse right against the muzzle of a cannon just before the touchhole was lit, thereby saving his company. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for this act. The British infantry charged, seized the lines, and Nana fled the field, leaving two cannons behind. On 16 July, Havelock&#x27;s forces began advancing towards Bithur. They managed to rescue a prisoner from the siege, William Jonah Shepherd, who provided them with valuable information.

Nana Sahib and his associates, including Tatya Tope and Azimullah Khan, debated what to do with the four men and 206 women and children held at Bibighar. Some of Nana Sahib&#x27;s advisors had already decided to kill the captives at Bibighar as revenge for the executions of Indians by the advancing British forces. Azimullah Khan suggested that the British might turn back from Kanpur if they had no hostages to rescue. The women of Nana Sahib&#x27;s household opposed this decision and went on a hunger strike, but their efforts were in vain.

On the 15th, after Bala arrived and announced his defeat at the Pandu River, the four male captives—Mr Thornhill, a judge from Fatehgarh; Col. Smith; Col. Goldie; and the 14-year-old Greenway—were bound, brought out of Bibighar, and shot by the sepoys.

Within an hour, Hussaini Begum announced to the women that they too would be killed. Jemadar Yousef Khan and his sepoys refused to kill the prisoners, even disobeying the orders of Tatya Tope on the matter. That evening, Hussaini Khanum organised four butchers from the Kanpur market, as well as a Eurasian member of Nana&#x27;s personal bodyguard, to kill the prisoners, and during the night, the entire group of prisoners was massacred. The screams were heard by the citizens who lived nearby. The next morning, the five returned with sweepers to remove the bodies. The bodies of the dead and three severely wounded boys were thrown into a well 9 feet wide and 50 feet deep near the house.

===Recapture of Kanpur by the British===

The Company forces reached Kanpur on 16 July 1857. Upon hearing of their approach and the news of the massacre, the local population fled. In the early hours of Friday, 17 July, the British arrived at Wheeler&#x27;s encampment. Two sympathetic Indians informed Havelock about the massacre at Bibighar and that Nana Sahib had taken a position at Ahirwa village. The British forces launched an attack on Nana&#x27;s troops and emerged victorious. In response, Nana blew up the Kanpur magazine, abandoned the location, and retreated to Bithur.

The women and children imprisoned in Bibighar had already been massacred with appalling violence. When the British soldiers, particularly Colonel Neill, learned of the Bibighar massacre, they engaged in retaliatory violence, including looting and burning houses. Neill forced the captured rebels to clean up the blood in Bibighar before executing them. On 18 July, Havelock heard about Neill&#x27;s punishments and put an end to the indiscriminate killing, even hanging one British soldier for his actions.

On 19 July, General Havelock resumed operations and left Bithur to save Lucknow, leaving Neill in charge at Kanpur. Nana Sahib had already escaped with an army of 12,000. Major Stevenson led a group of Madras Fusiliers and Sikh soldiers to Bithur, occupying Nana Sahib&#x27;s palace without resistance. Very few relics of Nana Saheb are known, but a silver-mounted sword seems to be one of the more interesting artefacts. Many British search parties attempted to capture Nana Saheb but failed. A detachment of the 7th Bengal Infantry came very close to capturing him, but he managed to escape just in time, leaving this sword on the table where he had been dining. Major Templer (later Major General) of the 7th Bengal Infantry brought the sword home. In the 1920s, the family loaned it to the Exeter Museum, until it was sold at auction in 1992. The present whereabouts of this sword are unknown.

By 13 August, around 4,000 rebels had reoccupied Bithur and threatened Havelock&#x27;s lines of communication at Bashiratganj. They were chased from their positions by the British, but they regrouped again at Bithur, where they were joined by the experienced Gwalior contingent and sepoys of the 42nd Infantry. In the subsequent engagement, the Madras Fusiliers, Highlanders, and Sikhs charged the defenders at Bithur, forcing them to retreat from Bithur and capture their artillery. Havelock&#x27;s forces suffered over 50 battle casualties and 12 from heat stroke, but the rebels were driven out of Bithur. After leaving a small force in Kanpur, General Havelock marched to Lucknow, where he broke through the rebel lines and reached the residency, but was in turn, besieged again in the residency, on 25 September.

Sir Colin Campbell was then put in charge of the British forces in the area. Kanpur remained peaceful due to the British garrison, with scant news about the Nana Sahib. Rumours suggested he was attempting to link up with Tatiya Tope at Fatehpur Chaurasi or was in Chandemagore seeking French assistance. Campbell left for Lucknow on 9 November, leaving behind a garrison of 500 British and Sikh soldiers under the command of the inexperienced Major General Windham. Tatiya Tope&#x27;s counterintelligence unmasked the Indian spies working for the British; they were mutilated and sent back to the British lines as a warning. 

Tatiya Tope attempted to recapture Kanpur during the Second Battle of Cawnpore in November 1857. He arrived with 6,000 soldiers and 18 cannons, with increasing numbers of volunteers and stragglers joining him. On 24 November, Maj. Gen. Windham advanced to meet them, but the British lost the ensuing battle and retreated to the newly fortified barracks, leaving their wounded and dead on the field. By 27 November, Kanpur was back in the hands of the Peshwa, and the bombardment of the British lines began again. Wounded British officers left in the field, were hanged from the branches of the very banyan tree where Neill had previously hung suspected rebels. Tatiya Tope managed to take control of all the routes west and northwest of Kanpur. 

Bala Rao, Jwala Prasad, and Rao Sahib set up their headquarters in the European quarter of Kanpur, though it remains unclear whether Nana Sahib and Azimulla Khan were with them or whether they both stayed at Bithur. In the meantime, Sir Colin Campbell retrieved the British forces from Lucknow and transported them to Allahabad. By 5 December, he had reached Kanpur with his army. Tatiya Tope&#x27;s army had also been reinforced and now included over 14,000 men, including the Gwalior contingent and 40 cannons. On 6 December, the British commenced an artillery barrage, and General Mansfield attacked the left flank of the rebel army, defeating them. On 7 December, the British reached the Bithur palace. The Nana had fled just prior to the arrival of the British cavalry, taking much of his treasure with him; however, he left behind treasure worth millions of rupees, along with guns, elephants, silver howdahs, and camels, all of which were seized by the British. Following extensive excavations to retrieve any hidden treasure, they set Nana Sahib&#x27;s palace on fire.

== Disappearance ==
Nana disappeared from Bithur after the company&#x27;s recapture of Kanpur and Bithur. The British offered a reward of Rs 100,000 (£10,000) for his capture. Subsequently, his movements could not be confirmed, as he consistently stayed a step ahead of his would-be captors. On 10 February 1858, Nana was reported to have entered Bundelkhand. Anghad Tiwari, a capable intelligence officer of the British, tracked him to a small fort in Fatehpur Chaurasi on 17 February, but he escaped just prior to the arrival of the British cavalry. 

At the start of April, the British learned that Nana had crossed the river near Bithur with an escort of 500 cavalry; however, he evaded the patrols sent by General Hope Grant to apprehend him. By the end of April, Nana had retreated back to Shahjahanpur. On 29 April, he wrote a letter addressed to Queen Victoria, stating that he had committed no murders and that the killings were carried out by rebels or &quot;budmashes&quot; (hooligans). In the meantime, Bala wrote a letter blaming his brother for the situation, claiming his own innocence.

Following the capture of Gwalior, Rani Laxmibai, Tatya Tope, and Rao Saheb (Nana Saheb&#x27;s nephew) proclaimed Nana Saheb as their Peshwa in June 1858 at Gwalior. In September 1858, Nana was reported to have fallen victim to malarial fever; however, this is disputed. He had also previously pretended to commit suicide at the Ganges when Bithur was taken by Sir Campbell&#x27;s army, suggesting he might simply have been trying to cover his tracks and throw off the pursuit. In December 1858, both Nana and the Begum of Oudh were said to be in Bahraich. 

On 30 December 1858, the British won the Battle of Banki. Although many rebels surrendered, it was understood that Nana and his younger brother Bala forded the river into Nepal with eight elephants loaded with treasure before the fight began. Both the rebels and the pursuing British suffered casualties during the river crossing due to the flooded river.

===Nepal connection===
By the start of 1859, Nana was reported to have fled to Nepal. Letters purportedly written by Bala and Nana, asking for terms of surrender, were sent to the British from Nepal. Perceval Landon recorded that Nana Sahib lived out his days in western Nepal, in Thapa Teli near Ririthang, under the protection of Sir Jang Bahadur Rana, the Prime Minister of Nepal. The final confirmed letter written by Nana, stamped with his own seal, was dated 13 May the following year. His family also received protection in Dhangara, eastern Nepal, in exchange for precious jewels. In February 1860, the British were informed that Nana&#x27;s wives had taken refuge in Nepal, residing in a house close to Thapathali. Nana himself was reported to be living in the interior of Nepal, as he did not trust the Rana. Thereafter, Nana disappeared from recorded history.

In October 1860, the British resident in Kathmandu was informed that Nana had passed away on 24 September due to malaria. Some government records also claimed he died in Nepal after being attacked by a tiger during a hunt on 24 September 1859, though there are conflicting accounts as to whether he was in Nepal in 1859 at all. Nana&#x27;s ultimate fate was never confirmed, and Bala was also said to have died of fever in the jungles of Nepal.

Venkateshwar, a Brahmin interrogated by the British, disclosed that he met Nana Sahib in Nepal in 1861. Up until 1888, there were rumours and reports that the Nana had been captured, with several individuals claiming to be the aged Nana turning themselves in to the British. As these reports proved false, further attempts at apprehending him were abandoned. There were also reports of the Nana being spotted in Constantinople (now Istanbul).

===Sihor connection===
Two letters and a diary retrieved in the 1970s suggest that Nana Saheb might have spent the rest of his days as an ascetic, Yogindra Dayanand Maharaj, in Sihor in coastal Gujarat until his death in 1903. The letters, possibly written by Nana Saheb in Old Marathi and signed &quot;Baloo Nana&quot;, were addressed to Harshram Mehta, Nana&#x27;s Sanskrit teacher. The third document, the diary of Kalyanji Mehta, Harshram&#x27;s brother, is written in Old Gujarati. The diary records Nana Saheb&#x27;s arrival in Sihor with his colleagues after the failure of the rebellion. Kalyanji raised Shridhar, Nana Saheb&#x27;s son, under the name Giridhar, and arranged his marriage into a Sihori Brahmin family. The diary also notes Nana Saheb&#x27;s death in 1903 at Kalyanji&#x27;s house in Dave Sheri, Sihor, where some of Nana&#x27;s belongings are still preserved. These documents were recovered by Keshavlal Mehta, Giridhar&#x27;s son, in the 1970s, and his descendants continue to reside in the town.

The authenticity of these documents was accepted by G.N. Pant, former director of the National Museum, in 1992, but they have not received official recognition.

===Belsare&#x27;s account===
K. V. Belsare&#x27;s book on the Maharashtrian saint Brahmachaitanya Gondavlekar Maharaj claims that after the last battle, Nana Saheb went to Naimisharanya, the Naimisha Forest near Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh, where he met Brahmachaitanya Maharaj, who assured him of safety. Nana Saheb is said to have lived there from 1860 until his death in 1906. According to the book, he died between 30 October and 1 November 1906, and Shri Brahmachaitanya Maharaj performed his last rites. The authenticity of the claims in the book is not established.

Initially, Nana Saheb was deeply distressed by the loss of his kingdom in battle with the British. However, Shri Gondavalekar Maharaj explained to him the &quot;Wish of God.&quot; He said, &quot;It is very sad that Nana Saheb had to lose the battle and the kingdom in such a tragic way, but fighting the British is totally different from fighting the Mughals. People from the middle class, who understand the British language, will lead the next freedom war against the British. Soon they will come into the picture. Your role as a king or warrior has ended, and now you need to focus on the &#x27;internal war&#x27;.&quot; Although it was initially difficult for Nana Saheb to accept this, he gradually came to terms with it and made progress on his spiritual journey.

===Aftermath of the events of 1857 ===
Nana&#x27;s brigadier, Jwala Prasad, was apprehended by the British and hanged in Kanpur on 3rd May 1860. During the trial, he claimed to have been physically present during the cremation of Nana&#x27;s body in Nepal. Tatia Tope, Nana&#x27;s commander, was betrayed in April 1859 by Man Singh, the Raja of Narwar, who handed him over to the British. On the 18th of April, he too was executed. Nana&#x27;s nephew, Rao Sahib, who had played an active role in the events of 1857, too was betrayed and handed over to the British in 1862. He was hanged at Satichaura Ghat on the 20th of August.

Hussaini Begum is believed to have fled with Nana&#x27;s entourage to Nepal, where she disappeared from history. However, Sarvur Khan, the Eurasian bodyguard she had employed to carry out the massacre at Bibighar, was arrested in February 1858 along with Muhammed Ali Khan, a courtier who had travelled to England in the entourage of Azimullah Khan. Owing to the chivalrous treatment by a British officer, Maj. Forbes-Mitchell, during their incarceration and up to their execution, Muhammed Ali Khan provided more in-depth information about the events of 1857. He also placed the blame on Hussaini Begum for the Bibighar massacre, stating that she harboured some grievances against the British which she took out on the hapless captives.

Baba Bhutt and Azimullah Khan were reportedly seen near Kolkata but their fate remains uncertain since they were not apprehended by the British. It was reported that Baba Butt died of some disease. Azimullah too was said to have died of smallpox in Bengal. Alternatively, there are also claims that he actually escaped India and made his way to Istanbul along with his companion, an English lady, a certain Miss Clayton, where they lived until old age. According to this account, Khan was murdered by local Turks in Istanbul after Miss Clayton&#x27;s death of old age.

General James Neill was killed in action during the relief of Lucknow on 25 September 1857. Major General Sir Henry Havelock died of dysentery in Lucknow in November 1857, shortly after the garrison had been rescued. Sir James Outram died in March 1863 in France, while Sir Colin Campbell, later ennobled as Baron Clyde, died in August 1863 in Kent.

After India gained independence in 1947, Nana was hailed as a freedom fighter, and the Nana Rao Park in Kanpur was constructed in honour of him and his brother, Bala Rao.

<doc id="774162" wikidata="Q442594" url="?curid=774162" title="John Joseph of Austria">
<text>John Joseph of Austria or John of Austria (the Younger) (; 7 April 1629 – 17 September 1679) was a Spanish general and political figure. He was the only illegitimate son of Philip IV of Spain to be acknowledged by the King and trained for military command and political administration. Don John advanced the causes of the Spanish Crown militarily and diplomatically in Naples, Sicily, Catalonia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Dunkirk, and other fronts. He was the governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1656 to 1659. He remained a popular hero even as the fortunes of Imperial Spain began to decline. His feuds with his father&#x27;s widow, Queen Mariana of Austria, led to a 1677 palace coup through which he exiled Mariana and took control of the monarchy of his half-brother Charles II of Spain. However, he proved far from the saviour Spain had hoped he would be. He remained in power until his death in 1679.

==Early life==

His mother was María &quot;La Calderona&quot; Calderón, a popular actress, who was forced into a convent shortly after his birth. He was raised in León by a woman of modest circumstances who likely did not know his parentage, though he received &quot;a careful education&quot; at Ocaña (Kingdom of Toledo). In 1642, the King recognized him officially as his son, creating him a prince (Serenity) and John began his life&#x27;s career as a military representative of his father&#x27;s interests.

==Military career==
Don John was sent in 1647 to Naples, then in the throes of the popular rising first led by Masaniello, with a naval squadron and a military force, to support the viceroy. He ordered his land and sea forces to blockade the rebel held city while Rodrigo Ponce de León, 4th Duke of Arcos inserted agents. Don John waited until the exhaustion of the insurgents and the follies of their French leader, Henry II, Duke of Guise allowed him to move in and crush the remains of the revolt and drive out the, by then, despised French.

He was next sent as viceroy to Sicily, whence he was recalled in 1651 to complete the pacification of the Principality of Catalonia, which had been in revolt since 1640. On the way to Catalonia to assume his position, he captured the French galleon &quot;Lion Couronné&quot;, with a squadron of galleys he had under his command. The high-handedness of the French, whom the Catalans had called in to help their revolt, had produced a reaction, and many switched their loyalties back to the Spanish King. By the time Don John assumed command, most of Catalonia had been recovered and he had not much more to do than to preside over the final siege of Barcelona and the convention which terminated the revolt in October 1652.

On both occasions, he played the peacemaker, and this sympathetic part, combined with his own pleasant manners, engaging personality, and a handsome person with bright eyes made him a popular royal favourite. In 1656, he was sent to command in Flanders, then in revolt against his own sovereign. At the storming of the French camp at Battle of Valenciennes in 1656, Don Juan Jose displayed great personal courage at the head of a brilliantly executed cavalry charge that caught the French totally by surprise. When, however, he took a part in the leadership of the army at the Battle of the Dunes, fought against the French under Turenne and the British forces sent by Oliver Cromwell, he was decisively defeated and failed to raise the Siege of Dunkirk, in spite of the efforts of Louis, Grand Condé, whose invaluable advice he neglected, and the stubborn fight put up by his own troops.

During 1661 and 1662, he fought against the Portuguese in Extremadura. The Spanish troops were ill-supplied and irregularly paid and in a rugged, hostile country. Morale was poor and they were untrustworthy but they were superior in numbers and some successes were gained. If Don John had not suffered from the indolence which Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon considered his chief defect, the Portuguese might have been hard-pressed. John&#x27;s forces overran the greater part of southern Portugal, but in 1663, with the Portuguese forces reinforced by a body of English troops, and put under the command of the Huguenot Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, Don John was completely beaten at Ameixial.

Even so, he might not have lost the confidence of his father, if Queen Mariana, mother of the sickly Prince of Asturias Charles, the only surviving legitimate son of the King, had not regarded him with distrust and dislike. Don John was removed from command and sent to his estate at Consuegra.

==Opposition to Queen Mariana of Spain==
After the death of Philip IV in 1665, Don John became the recognized leader of the opposition to the government of Philip&#x27;s widow, the regent. She and her favourite, the German Jesuit Juan Everardo Nithard, seized and put to death one of his most trusted servants, Don Jose Malladas.

Don John, in return, put himself at the head of a rising of Aragon and Catalonia, which led to the expulsion of Nithard on 25 February 1669. Don John was, however, forced to content himself with the viceroyalty of Aragon. In 1677, the queen mother aroused universal opposition by her favour for Fernando de Valenzuela. Don John was able to drive her from court and establish himself as prime minister. Great hopes were entertained for his administration, but it proved disappointing and short; Don John died, perhaps by poison, on 17 September 1679.

==Popish Plot==
His name featured prominently in the Popish Plot fabricated by the notorious informer Titus Oates in England in 1678. Oates unwisely claimed to have met Don John in Madrid; when questioned closely by Charles II of England, who had met Don John in Brussels in 1656, it became clear that Oates had no idea what he looked like, confirming the King&#x27;s suspicion that the Plot was an invention.

<text>John of Ávila (; 6 January 1499– 10 May 1569) was a Spanish priest, preacher, scholastic author, and religious mystic, who has been declared a saint and Doctor of the Church by the Catholic Church. He is called the &quot;Apostle of Andalusia&quot;, for his extensive ministry in that region.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
He was born in Almodóvar del Campo, in the modern-day Province of Ciudad Real, to Alfonso de Ávila, of Jewish converso descent, and Catalina Xixón (or &quot;Gijón&quot;), a wealthy and pious couple. At the age of fourteen, in 1513, he was sent to the University of Salamanca to study law; he withdrew in 1517, however, without receiving a degree.

Returning home, Ávila spent the next three years in the practice of austere piety. His sanctity impressed a Franciscan friar journeying through Almodóvar, on whose advice he resumed his studies by matriculating at the University of Alcalá de Henares (which was moved to the national capital in the 19th century and renamed the Complutense University of Madrid). There he undertook the study of philosophy and theology, in which he was fortunate to have as his teacher the noted Dominican friar Domingo de Soto. It appears that Ávila earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree during his years at Alcalá and then left without completing requirements for the licentiate degree.

Both his parents died while Ávila was still a student, and after his ordination in spring 1526, he celebrated his first Mass in the church where they were buried. He then sold the family property and gave the proceeds to the poor. He saw in the severing of natural ties a vocation to foreign missionary work and prepared to go to Mexico. He therefore traveled to Seville to await departure for the Indies in January 1527 with the Dominican friar, Julián Garcés, appointed the first Bishop of Tlaxcala. While waiting in Seville, his unusually great devotion in celebrating Mass, and his skills in catechesis and preaching, attracted the attention of Hernando de Contreras, a local priest, who mentioned him to the Archbishop of Seville and Inquisitor General, Alonso Manrique de Lara. The archbishop saw in the young cleric a powerful instrument to stir up the faith in Andalusia, and after considerable persuasion Juan was induced to abandon his journey to America.

John seems to have lived in the initial years after 1526 in a small house in Seville with another priest, probably Contreras, and disciples gathered around him, in a loosely structured fraternal life. It was at the request of the younger sister of one of these disciples, Sancha Carrillo, that he began in 1527 to write the &quot;Audi, filia&quot; (&quot;Listen, Daughter&quot;), a work he continued expanding and editing until his death.

===Apostle of Andalusia===
John&#x27;s first sermon was preached on 22 July 1529, and immediately established his reputation. During his nine years of missionary work in Andalusia, crowds packed the churches at all his sermons. However, his strong pleas for reform and his denunciation of the behaviour of the aristocracy meant that he was denounced to the office of the Inquisition in Seville in 1531, and put in prison in the summer of 1532. He was charged with exaggerating the dangers of wealth and with closing the gates of heaven to the rich. The charges were refuted and he was declared innocent and released in July 1533.

Around the end of 1534 or the beginning of 1535, John of Ávila was incardinated into the Diocese of Córdoba, from which he received a small benefice. This city became his base for directing his disciples and moving around Andalusia, preaching and establishing schools and colleges in various neighbouring cities such as Granada, Baeza, Montilla and Zafra. It is thought that during this time Ávila received the title of Master of Sacred Theology, probably in Granada around 1538.

Of special importance was the University of Baeza, established in 1538 by a papal bull of Pope Paul III. Ávila served as its first rector, and it became a model for seminaries and for the schools of the Jesuits.

Ávila stayed in Granada from 1538–9, where it appears some kind of community was taking shape. Likewise, during the years 1546 to 1555, John lived with about 20 disciples in Córdoba, making it seem that he intended to begin some kind of formal foundation of apostolic priests. However, the foundation and fast expansion of the Jesuits meant that these ideas never came to fruition; from early 1551, when Ávila began to experience poor health, he began actively encouraging his disciples who so desired to join the Jesuits (around 30 in total seem to have joined).

===Death===
From early 1551 Ávila was in constant ill-health. He spent the last years of his life in semi-retirement in the town of Montilla, in the Province of Córdoba. He died there on 10 May 1569, and in accordance with his wishes was buried in that city, in the Jesuit Church of the Incarnation, which now serves as the sanctuary to his memory.

==Works==
The Spanish critical edition of 1970 presents Ávila&#x27;s work in 6 volumes. These consist of two redactions he made of the &quot;Audi, filia&quot;, 82 sermons and spiritual conferences, a few Biblical commentaries, 257 letters (representing the period from 1538 until his death), several treatises on reform and other minor treatises. John wrote letters to prelates who consulted him, such as Pedro Guerrero, Archbishop of Granada, and Juan de Ribera and Thomas of Villanova, both archbishops of Valencia who were later canonised. He also wrote to Ignatius of Loyola, John of God and Teresa of Ávila.

===Modern editions===
Saint John of Ávila&#x27;s works were collected at Madrid in 1618, 1757, 1792 and 1805; a French translation by D&#x27;Andilly was published at Paris in 1673; and a German translation by Schermer in six volumes was issued at Regensburg between 1856 and 1881.

The &quot;Audi, filia&quot; was translated into English in 1620. A modern translation was published by the American scholar Joan Frances Gormley in 2006.

A selection of his letters, entitled &quot;Spiritual Letters&quot;, were translated into English in 1631, a facsimile edition of which was printed in 1970.

== Influence==
Ávila&#x27;s saintly reputation, as well as his efforts to reform the clergy, to establish schools and colleges, and to catechise the laity, were the inspiration for many later reformers. He is especially revered by the Jesuits. Their development in Spain is attributed to his friendship and support for the Society of Jesus.

There is a church in Alcalá de Henares dedicated to him: St. John of Ávila Parish Church. The school Colegio Maestro Ávila in Salamanca is named after him.

===Veneration===

Ávila was declared Venerable by Pope Clement XIII on 8 February 1759. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 15 November 1894, and the cause for his canonization was opened on 14 March 1952. On 31 May 1970 he was canonized by Pope Paul VI.

Pope Benedict XVI named him a Doctor of the Church on 7 October 2012, the Feast of the Holy Rosary. The proclamation of the two new Doctors of the Church was made by Pope Benedict before tens of thousands of people in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. During his homily, Pope Benedict said that John of Ávila was a &quot;profound expert on the sacred Scriptures, he was gifted with an ardent missionary spirit. He knew how to penetrate in a uniquely profound way the mysteries of the redemption worked by Christ for humanity. A man of God, he united constant prayer to apostolic action. He dedicated himself to preaching and to the more frequent practice of the sacraments, concentrating his commitment on improving the formation of candidates for the priesthood, of religious and of lay people, with a view to a fruitful reform of the Church&quot;.

According to the Apostolic letter for the proclamation to Doctor of the Church, John of Ávila explained that &quot;Christian spiritual life, as a participation in the life of the Blessed Trinity, begins with faith in the God who is Love, is grounded in God&#x27;s goodness and mercy as expressed in the merits of Christ, and is wholly guided by the Spirit&quot;. More than a venerable professor, &quot;Father Master Avila&quot; was primarily a preacher and closely friend of Ignatius Loyola. John of Ávila authored a &quot;prayerful and sapiential&quot; theology, based on the &quot;primacy of Christ and of grace in relation to the love of God, for which he showed &quot;a profound knowledge of the Bible&quot;, without setting forth a systematic synthesis.

The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments fixed his optional memorial as 10 May.

<text>Yuan Taotu (; died c. 625 BC, posthumous title ) was a nobleman and diplomat of the Spring and Autumn state of Chen. He is regarded as the ancestor of those surnamed Yuan ().

Yuan Taotu was a distant relative of the Chen royal family, with a fief at Yangxia (Taikang, Henan province). He is mentioned in passing in the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; and &quot;Historical Records&quot;. In 656 BC, he accompanied Duke Huan of Qi on an expedition against the southern state of Cai and was present at the historic covenant of alliance between the various states of the Yellow River valley at Shaoling. On the return journey to the north, however, he suggested that the army of Qi pass by Chen and take a detour to the eastern regions. For this advice he was arrested and only released after an abortive invasion of Chen ended the next year.

The state of Chen supported the neighbouring state of Chu at the Battle of Chengpu in 632 BC, and was defeated. The next year, Yuan Taotu was sent as representative of Chen to Diquan, to renew the state&#x27;s allegiance to the King of Zhou and to consult about an invasion of Zheng. In the winter of that same year, the Chen heir-apparent met with other princes, witnessing the investiture of the Duke of Jin as hegemon. Yuan probably died shortly thereafter.

<text>Low-Life is the third studio album by English rock band New Order, released on 13 May 1985 by Factory Records. It is considered to be among the band&#x27;s strongest work, displaying the moment they completed their transformation from post-punk hold-overs to dance-rockers. The album shows New Order&#x27;s increased incorporation of synthesisers and samplers, while still preserving the rock elements of their earlier work. The original Factory CD issues of the album were mastered with pre-emphasis.

The songs on this album formed the basis of the band&#x27;s live concert video &quot;Pumped Full of Drugs&quot;, filmed in Tokyo shortly before the album&#x27;s release. The music video for &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; was directed by Jonathan Demme.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork is the only New Order release to feature photographs of the band members on its cover; according to designer Peter Saville, the decision to do this was due to him growing tired of his previous &quot;concept covers.&quot; To photograph the band, Saville took portraits of them with instant film, which he saw as more versatile than conventional 135 film, stating that &quot;you could push it and do funny things with it. It was very graphic and very dynamic. The grain and the texture made everything look like a movie film.&quot; Saville further stated that the band were initially reluctant to depict themselves in the artwork; however, thanks in part to the rapid turnaround of instant film, they grew to enjoy the photoshoot after seeing the results. The CD version of the album comes packaged with drummer/keyboardist Stephen Morris on the front cover, while inside the case are four photographs and a semi-transparent piece of paper with the band&#x27;s name, allowing consumers to choose which band member is seen through the sleeve.

==Singles and re-releases==
The album was preceded by the release of the full-length version of &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; as a single (only an edited version appears on the album). John Robie&#x27;s remix of &quot;Sub-culture&quot; was also released as a 12″ single. Both of these extended versions eventually were included on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Substance&quot;.

In 2008, the album was re-released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition with a bonus disc, including the 17-minute complete version of &quot;Elegia&quot;, which was only previously available on a limited edition disc of the 2002 box set &quot;Retro&quot; and, for the first time in digital format, the unedited 12″ mix of &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot;.

In 2023, the album was re-released as the Definitive Edition, featuring bonus CDs and DVDs with previously unreleased content.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review of &quot;Low-Life&quot; for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Richard Cromelin stated that New Order&#x27;s &quot;varied menu of soul-pop, techno-rock, delicate instrumental moods, and driving, clattering percussion offers adventure in texture at every turn&quot;, and that while the album does not contain &quot;anything as transcendent&quot; as &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by New Order&#x27;s precursor Joy Division, &quot;its confidence and imagination suggest that the possibility is still there.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted New Order&#x27;s attempt to insert some &quot;affect&quot; into its music and wrote that the band &quot;has its heart (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) in the right place, so one doesn&#x27;t want to quibble.&quot; While panning &quot;Love Vigilantes&quot; as &quot;an appallingly naive self-parody&quot;, Steve Sutherland of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; found that the remainder of the album &quot;boasts the most articulate sound since The Cocteaus&#x27; &quot;Treasure&quot;, elevating depression to ecstasy.&quot; Giving it an 8 out of 10 rating, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Neil Tennant found it to be New Order&#x27;s best work: &quot;the songs are much stronger than usual - not just doomy electronic workouts but memorable melodies with a sense of humour lurking in the words.&quot;

John Bush of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Low-Life&quot; was &quot;in every way, the artistic equal&quot; of New Order&#x27;s previous album &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;, as well as &quot;the point where the band&#x27;s fusion of rock and electronics became seamless&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Josh Modell similarly noted that the album &quot;completely locked the disco influences into sync with New Order&#x27;s pop leanings&quot;. David Quantick, writing in &quot;Uncut&quot;, felt that &quot;Low-Life&quot; was &quot;the first New Order album that sounds like an album&quot;, with Bernard Sumner&#x27;s &quot;most human lyrics&quot; complementing Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris&#x27; &quot;pop axis&quot; and Peter Hook&#x27;s &quot;breath-taking&quot; bass performances. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Low-Life&quot; at number 97 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. &quot;Low-Life&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>John of God, O.H. (; ; born João Duarte Cidade ; March 8, 1495 – March 8, 1550) was a Portuguese soldier turned healthcare worker in Spain, whose followers later formed the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God, a Catholic religious institute dedicated to the care of the poor, sick and those with mental disorders. 

Cidade was canonized by Pope Alexander VIII and is considered one of the leading religious figures in the history of the Iberian Peninsula.

==Biography==
The first biography of John of God was written by Francisco de Castro, the chaplain at John of God&#x27;s hospital in Granada, Spain. He drew from his personal knowledge of John as a young man and also used material gathered from eyewitnesses and contemporaries of his subject. It was published at the express wish of the Archbishop of Granada who gave financial backing to its publication. Castro began writing in 1579, 29 years after John of God&#x27;s death, but he did not live to see it published, for he died soon after completing the work. His mother, Catalina de Castro, had the book published in 1585.

Shortly after the publication of Castro&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, an Italian translation was published at Rome by an Oratorian priest, Giovanni Bordini, in 1587. Despite several mistranslations and his own extraneous comments, this work became the source of most translations into other languages.

===Early life===

John of God was born João Duarte Cidade in Montemor-o-Novo, now in the District of Évora, Kingdom of Portugal, the son of André Cidade and Teresa Duarte, a once-prominent family that was impoverished but had great religious faith. One day, when John was eight years of age, he disappeared. Whether he had been deliberately kidnapped, or whether he had been seduced from his home by a cleric who had been given hospitality in the home, is not clear. According to his original biography, his mother died from grief soon after this, and his father joined the Franciscan Order.

The young Cidade soon found himself a homeless orphan in the streets of Oropesa, near Toledo, Spain. There, in a foreign land, he had no one to care for him, nothing on which to live, and he had to be content with whatever food he could find. He was eventually taken in by a man called Francisco Mayoral and the boy settled down as a shepherd caring for his sheep in the countryside.

===Military life===
The farmer was so pleased with Cidade&#x27;s strength and diligence that he wanted him to marry his daughter and to become his heir. When he was about 22 years of age, to escape his master&#x27;s well-meant but persistent offer of his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage, the young man joined a company of foot-soldiers, and in that company he fought for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, eventually dispatched by the Count of Oropesa, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo y Zúñiga, against French forces at Fontarabia. While serving there, he was appointed to guard an enormous amount of loot, much of which had been rifled by the time he was relieved. Suspicion naturally fell on Cidade; even if he had not been involved in the theft, at the least he was guilty of dereliction of duty. He was condemned to death, and that would have been his fate had not some more tolerant officer intervened to win his pardon.

Disillusioned by this turn of events after what he felt was faithful military service, Cidade returned to the farm in Oropesa. He then spent four years again following a pastoral life. This went on until the day that the Count and his troops marched by, on their way to fight in Hungary against the Turks. Still unmarried, he immediately decided to enlist with them and left Oropesa for a final time. For the next 18 years he served as a trooper in various parts of Europe.

When the Count and his troops had helped in the rout of the Turks, they set sail to return to Spain, landing in A Coruña in Galicia. Then Cidade found himself so close to his homeland, he decided to return to his hometown and to see what he could learn of the family he had lost so many years before. By that time, he had forgotten his parents&#x27; names but retained enough information from his childhood that he was able to track down an uncle he had still living in the town. He learned their fate from this uncle and, realizing that he no longer had real ties to the region, returned to Spain.

===Africa===
Cidade arrived near Seville, where he soon found work herding sheep, which was familiar to him. With the time now available to him to ponder his life, he began to realize that this occupation no longer satisfied him, and he felt a desire to see Africa and possibly give his life as a martyr through working to free Christians enslaved there. He set out for the Portuguese territory of Ceuta (located on the northern coast of Africa). On the way, he befriended a Portuguese knight also traveling there with his wife and daughters, who was being exiled to that region by the King of Portugal for some crime he had committed.

When they arrived in the colony, the knight found that the few possessions the family had been able to take with them had been stolen, leaving them penniless. Additionally the entire family had become ill. Having no other recourse, the knight appealed to Cidade for his help. He promised to care for the family and began to nurse them and found work to provide them with food, despite the poor treatment poor citizens received at the hands of the colony&#x27;s rulers.

The desertion of one of Cidade&#x27;s coworkers to a nearby Muslim city in order to escape this treatment (which meant his conversion to that faith) led to a growing feeling of despair in him. Troubled and feeling spiritually lost from his failure to practice his faith during his years of military service, he went to the Franciscan friary in the colony. There he was advised that his desire to be in Africa was not working to his spiritual growth and that he should consider returning to Spain. He decided to do this. Landing in Gibraltar, he began to wander around the region of Andalusia, trying to find what God might want from him.

It was during this period of his life that Cidade is said to have had a vision of the Infant Jesus, who bestowed on him the name by which he was later known, John of God, also directing him to go to Granada. Cidade then settled in that city, where he worked disseminating books, using the recently invented moveable type printing press to provide people with works of chivalry and devotional literature.

===Conversion===

Cidade experienced a major religious conversion on Saint Sebastian&#x27;s Day (January 20) of 1537, while listening to a sermon by John of Ávila, a leading preacher of the day who was later to become his spiritual director and would encourage him in his quest to improve the life of the poor. At age 42, he had what was perceived at the time as an acute mental breakdown. Moved by the sermon, he engaged in a public beating of himself, begging mercy and wildly repenting for his past life. He was incarcerated in the area of the Royal Hospital reserved for the mentally ill and received the treatment of the day, which was to be segregated, chained, flogged, and starved. Cidade was visited by John of Avila, who advised him to be more actively involved in tending to the needs of others rather than in enduring personal hardships. John gained peace of heart and shortly after left the hospital to begin work among the poor.

Around this time, he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura, where it is said he experienced a vision of Mary, who encouraged him to work with the poor. Cidade expended all his energy in caring for the neediest people of the city. He established a house where he wisely tended to the needs of the sick poor, at first doing his own begging. When John began to put into effect his dream, because of the stigma attached to mental illness he found himself misunderstood and rejected. For some time he was alone in his charitable work, soliciting by night the needed medical supplies and by day attending to the needs of his patients and the hospital; but he soon received the cooperation of charitable priests and physicians. Many stories are related of the heavenly guests who visited him during the early days of his immense tasks, which were lightened at times by the archangel Raphael in person. To put a stop to his custom of exchanging his cloak with any beggar he chanced to meet, Sebastian Ramirez, Bishop of Tui, had a religious habit made for him, which was later adopted in all its essentials as the religious garb of his followers, and the bishop imposed on him for all time the name given him by the Infant Jesus, John of God.

==Brothers Hospitallers==
Slowly John drew to himself a dedicated circle of disciples who felt called to join him in this service. He organized his followers into the Order of Hospitallers, who were approved by the Holy See in 1572 as the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God, who care for the sick in countries around the world. One mark of honour to his labours is that this order has been officially entrusted with the medical care of the pope. When John of God died the successor of the order was Pedro Soriano.

==Veneration==
John of God died on March 8, 1550, his 55th birthday, in Granada. He died of pneumonia after he had plunged into a river to save a young man from drowning. His body was initially buried in the Church of Our Lady of the Victories, belonging to the Minim friars, and remained there until November 28, 1664, when the Hospitaller Brothers had his relics moved to the church of their hospital in the city,

John was canonized by Pope Alexander VIII on October 16, 1690, and later named the patron saint of hospitals and the sick. His feast day is celebrated on March 8. A church was erected in 1757 to house his remains. On October 26, 1757, they were transferred to that church, now protected by the Knights of Saint John of God. The church has been raised to the rank of a basilica.

==Legacy==
The order maintains a presence in 53 countries, operating more than 300 hospitals, services, and centers serving a range of medical needs in addition to mental health and psychiatry. The Family of Saint John of God, as those who commit to his vision are called, is made up of more than 45,000 members, brothers and co-workers, and supported by tens of thousands of benefactors and friends who identify with and support the work of the order for sick and needy people across the world.

<text>Greektown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is an area in the Kitsilano neighborhood that was historically an enclave of Greek immigrants and their descendants. 
The term is an informal one, and Greektown&#x27;s borders are not strictly defined; however, West Broadway around Trutch Street is generally considered the neighbourhood&#x27;s heart, while Blenheim St to the west and MacDonald St to the east are approximately its outer limits. Vancouverites of Greek descent, who live in Kitsilano, nostalgically also call the area Ουέστ Μπροντουέι (literally &quot;West Broadway&quot;).

This Greek identity has waned considerably since the area first became a community of exiles during the dictatorship in Greece of the 1960s and early 1970s, and the primary markers of Greektown are St. George&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral located at the intersection of Arbutus Street and Valley Drive, the local Athens Social Club, a Greek supermarket, and a higher-than-average concentration of Greek restaurants. There is also a Greek Senior Citizen Society.

St. George&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral been noted for its traditional Byzantine Icons. St. George&#x27;s Hellenic Community of Vancouver (attached to the cathedral with the same patron saint), holds every year a Greek Food Festival from October 20 to October 22.

The Hellenic Cultural Festival takes place every June in Kitsilano. The highlight is Greek Day, when Broadway is closed to vehicle traffic between MacDonald and Blenheim for free, family-oriented festivities. The festival is part of an ongoing effort to restore the Greek identity of Greektown.

==History==
After World War II, Greek refugees from Europe and western Canada congregated in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver. They founded the aforementioned Greek Orthodox Cathedral, several businesses and social clubs, schools, a bank, newspapers, and, later, a television station.

In the 1971 Canada census, Greek was the second-most common language and ethnicity in the Kitsilano area (most common was English and the British Isles, respectively). In 1974, the city of Vancouver sanctioned an annual Greek Day celebration in the area.

The current St. George&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral was built in 1974 and its adjacent Hellenic Community Centre was built shortly thereafter in 1977.

Originally St. George&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Cathedral was located at West Seventh and Vine. But between 1954 and 1960 when Vancouver saw such an influx of Greek immigrants that St. George&#x27;s Hellenic community leaders realized their original church was no longer large enough to accommodate the congregation. The property, today the home of Kitsilano Neighbourhood House, was also not big enough for the construction of a larger church so a new location was proposed.

In the 2001 Canada census, the percentage of people in Kitsilano reporting Greek as their mother tongue had shrunk to 2 percent, fewer than those speaking English, Chinese, French, or German.

In 2005 the City of Vancouver, the Government of British Columbia, and the Government of Greece sponsored a return of Greek Day that has continued annually since.

<text>A chronogram is a sentence or inscription in which specific letters, interpreted as numerals (such as Roman numerals), stand for a particular date when rearranged. The word, meaning &quot;time writing&quot;, derives from the Greek words &quot;chronos&quot; (χρόνος &quot;time&quot;) and &quot;gramma&quot; (γράμμα, &quot;letter&quot;).

In the &quot;pure chronogram&quot;, each word contains a numeral; the &quot;natural chronogram&quot; shows all numerals in the correct numerical order, e.g. AMORE MATVRITAS = MMVI = 2006. Chronograms in versification are referred to as &quot;chronosticha&quot; if they are written in hexameter and &quot;chronodisticha&quot; if they are written in distich.

In the ancient Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist tradition, especially in ancient Java, chronograms were called &quot;chandrasengkala&quot; and usually used in inscriptions to signify a given year in the Saka calendar. Certain words were assigned their specific number, and poetic phrases were formed from these selected words to describe particular events that have their own numerical meanings. For example, the &quot;chandrasengkala&quot; &quot;sirna ilang kertaning bumi&quot; (&quot;the wealth of earth disappeared and diminished&quot;) (&quot;sirna&quot; = 0, &quot;ilang&quot; = 0, &quot;kerta&quot; = 4, &quot;bumi&quot; = 1) corresponds to the year 1400 in the Saka calendar (1478 CE), the date of the fall of the Majapahit Empire.

==Roman numerals==

Chronograms from the Roman Empire are reported but not confirmed. The earliest confirmed chronograms using Roman numerals were devised in the mid 14th century but retrospective chronograms which express earlier dates are known. Chronograms were particularly popular during the Renaissance, when chronograms were often used on tombstones and foundation stones to mark the date of the event being commemorated. They were popular during the Baroque as well. In 1711, Joseph Addison compared chronograms to &quot;anagrams and acrostics&quot;. Examples include:



*&quot;My Day Closed Is In Immortality&quot; is a chronogram commemorating the death of Queen Elizabeth I of England. The initial letters of the words read MDCIII, which corresponds to 1603, the year of Elizabeth&#x27;s death.
*&quot;ChrIstVs DuX ergo trIVMphVs&quot; (&quot;Christ the Leader so a triumph&quot;), on a coin struck by Gustavus Adolphus in 1627, gives MDCXVVVII or 1627. Although chronograms are relatively scarce on coins, many inscriptions on medals incorporate chronograms.
*In a work entitled &quot;Hugo Grotius his Sophompaneas&quot;, published in 1652, the date is indicated by the author&#x27;s name: &quot;FranCIs GoLDsMIth&quot;. This gives MDCLII or 1652.
*An example of a short chronogram is on the monument commemorating the 1764 Massacre at Madéfalva in Transsylvania. The script Siculicidium (in Latin, meaning &quot;murder of Székelys&quot;) written SICVLICIDIVM, gives exactly 1764. Only the beginning letter &quot;S&quot; is not used from the one-word chronogram.

Many lengthy examples of chronograms can be found in Germany and the countries that had been part of the Holy Roman Empire, such as Austria and Czechia, or Hungary and Slovakia. These often commemorate the building of houses in the form of prayers or quotations from the Bible. For instance, &quot;SVRGE O IEHOVA ATQVE DISPERGE INIMICOS TVOS&quot; (&quot;Rise, oh Jehovah, and destroy your enemies&quot;, a slightly altered version of Psalm 68:2) gives 1625 as the year of building. One double chronogram, in Latin and English, on the year 1642, reads, &quot;&#x27;TV DeVs IaM propItIVs sIs regI regnoqVe hVIC VnIVerso.&quot; – &quot;O goD noVV sheVV faVoVr to the kIng anD thIs VVhoLe LanD.&quot; The English sentence demonstrates that the origin of the letter w as a double v or u was recognised historically.
In Hildesheim in the North of Germany, the inscription &quot;CVra BonIfaCII, PrIMo, QVo PraefVIt Anno Abbas SpeCtatos CoLLoCat Hos CeLares &quot; showing the year 1770 can be read above the entrance of the Hospital of Five Wounds which was built in the year indicated.

==Hebrew numerals==

The great popularity of chronograms in Jewish tradition, and the extent to which they have been cultivated, may be explained by the fact that they are a variety of the Jewish mystical practice of Gematria.

The earliest chronogram in Jewish literature is one found in a Hebrew poem of the year 1205 by Al-Harizi, while the earliest Latin chronogram is dated five years later. According to Abraham Firkovich, Hebrew chronograms date back to 582; but the inscriptions cited by him are probably forgeries. In the thirteenth century chronograms are found in the epitaphs of German Jews (Lewysohn, &quot;Nafshot Zaddikim&quot;, No. 14, of the year 1261; No. 16, of the year 1275).

===In epitaphs===

It is evident, therefore, that for a period of five hundred years chronograms occurred in the epitaphs of European Jews. Thus the dates of the epitaphs of the family of Asher ben Jehiel in the first half of the fourteenth century are indicated by chronograms (Almanzi, &quot;Abne Zikkaron&quot;, pp. 4, 6, 9); and among sixty-eight Frankfort epitaphs of that century four chronograms have been preserved (Horowitz, &quot;Inschriften... zu Frankfurt-am-Main&quot;, Nos. 8, 29, 36, 68). The German Jews seem to have possessed little skill in the composition of chronograms, there being only about twenty-five (and these very simple) in a total of some 6,000 inscriptions. In Bohemia and Poland, chronograms in epitaphs occur more frequently, and are often very clever; for example, the epitaph of the physician Menahem b. Asher Mazzerato, who died at Prague in 1680, reads as follows: איש צדיק ישר חכם וענו האלוף מהר״ר מנחם רופא מומחה (Lieben, &quot;Gal &#x27;Ed,&quot; p. 36); and the numerical value of the marked initial letters therein amounts to 440; i.e., 5440, the Jewish year in which Menahem died. The year of death of the associate rabbi of Prague, Zalman, who perished in the great fire of 1689 (=5449 Jewish era), is indicated by the words &#x27;באש יצא מאת ד (bolded letters equal 449) (ib. No. 59).

===In books===
While the epitaphs, in addition to the chronograms, in many cases directly mention the dates, many manuscripts, and an even greater number of printed books, are dated simply by means of chronograms; authors, copyists, and typographers rivaling one another in hiding the dates in intricate chronograms, most difficult to decipher. Hence, many data of Jewish bibliography still remain to be determined, or at least rectified. Down to recent times the custom of indicating dates by means of chronograms was so prevalent in Jewish literature that all but few books are dated by numerals only. In the earliest printed books the chronograms consist of one or two words only: the Soncino edition of the Talmud, for instance, has for its date the earliest printed chronogram, גמרא (&quot;Gemara&quot;) = 244 (1484 C.E.). Words like רננו (&quot;rejoice ye!&quot;), שמחה (&quot;joy&quot;), ברנה (&quot;with rejoicing&quot;) were especially used for this purpose, as they express happiness. Later on, entire verses of the Bible, or sentences from other books, having some reference to the contents or title of the book, or to the name of the author, publisher, printer, etc., were used. In longer sentences, in which some of the letters were not utilized in the chronogram, those that counted were marked by dots, lines, or different type, or were distinguished in other ways. Innumerable errors have been made by bibliographers because the distinguishing marks were missing or blotted, or had been omitted. To this source of confusion must be added the varying methods of indicating the &quot;thousand&quot; of the Jewish era. The Italian, Oriental, and earlier Amsterdam editions frequently designate the thousand as ( = , &quot;the major era&quot;). The German and Polish editions omit the thousand, considering only ( = , &quot;the minor era&quot;); but as neither the former nor the latter is employed throughout the respective editions, many errors arise. The following chronogram, which Rabbi Samuel Schotten adds to his work &quot;Kos ha-Yeshu&#x27;ot&quot; (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1711), shows how artificial and verbose chronograms may be: &quot;Let him who wishes to know the year of the Creation pour the contents out of the cup [i.e., count the word &quot;kos,&quot; כוס with defective spelling = 80] and seek aid [ = 391; together 471] in the sixth millennium.&quot; The days of the month and week are indicated in the same way.

Many important years in Jewish history are indicated by their respective chronograms; e.g., the year 1492 by מזרה (&quot;scatterer&quot; = 252, after Jer. xxi. 10, which says that God scattered Israel). This was the year when the Jews were expelled from Spain (Abravanel&#x27;s Introduction to his Commentary on Kings).

===In poetry===

Neo-Hebraic poetry, which laid especial stress on the formal side of verse, also cultivated chronograms. A number of Hebrew poems were produced in the first half of the 19th century, in which the letters of each verse have the same numerical value, being generally the year in which it was written. A New-year&#x27;s poem in this style, written in the year 579 (=1819), is found in Shalom Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Ketab Yosher&quot; (ed. Warsaw, p. 146). Two years later Jacob Eichenbaum wrote a poem in honor of a friend, each line of which had the numerical value of 581 (&quot;Kol Zimrah&quot;, ed. Leipsic, pp. 50–53). While this poem is really a work of art, in spite of the artifice employed, Eichenbaum&#x27;s imitators have in their translations merely produced rhymes with certain numerical values. Gottlober (in &quot;Ha-Kokabim&quot;, i. 31) wrote an excellent satire on these rimesters, each line of his poem having the numerical value of 618 (=1858). The first two verses of the poem are as follows:

But even poets like I. L. Gordon and A. B. Lewensohn have a great weakness for the לפקים (&quot;minor eras&quot;), though employing them only in the super-scriptions to their poems.

==Arabic numerals==
The letters of the Arabic language also each have a numerical value, which can be used for chronograms in languages which use the Arabic alphabet. Thus the tomb of the Persian poet Hafez in Shiraz has engraved on it the Persian words &quot;ḵāk-e moṣallā&quot; &#x27;dust of Musalla&#x27; (Musalla was a park or pleasure ground in Shiraz made famous in Hafez&#x27;s poem Shirazi Turk and other works); the letters of this phrase add up to the Islamic date 791 (equivalent to AD 1389/1390).

<text>Yuan Shu () (died July or August 199), courtesy name Gonglu, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He rose to prominence following the collapse of the Han central government in 189. He declared himself Emperor of China in 197 under the short-lived Zhong dynasty, two years before his death in 199.

== Life ==
===Early life===
Yuan Shu was from Ruyang County (), Runan Commandery, which is in present-day Shangshui County, Henan. His family had for over four generations been a prominent force in the Han civil service, having produced numerous members in high positions since the first century CE. Descended from Yuan An, who served during the reign of Emperor Zhang, Yuan Shu was a son of the Minister of Works Yuan Feng () and his principal wife. Yuan Shu is sometimes described to be a younger cousin of the warlord Yuan Shao, but was actually Yuan Shao&#x27;s younger half-brother.

As a young man he gained a reputation for gallantry and liked to go hunting with dogs and falcons. Nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, he later became Intendant of Henan () and then General of the Household Rapid as a Tiger ().

=== Campaign against Dong Zhuo (189–191) ===

After the death of General-in-Chief He Jin (22 September 189), Yuan Shu, as the Imperial Corps Commander of the Imperial Tiger Guards, led his men to kill the eunuch faction. When Dong Zhuo seized control of the Han central government, he wanted to appoint Yuan Shu as General of the Rear, but, fearing Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shu fled to Nanyang Commandery, which he took control over after Sun Jian killed its grand administrator, Zhang Zi.

Yuan Shu participated in the Campaign against Dong Zhuo led by Yuan Shao. He was joined by Sun Jian, whom he appointed to Inspector of Yu Province. Sun Jian succeeded in defeating and killing Dong&#x27;s general Hua Xiong (191), but Yuan Shu grew wary that Sun would become too successful and no longer submit to his command, and temporarily secretly cut off Sun&#x27;s food supplies, thereby hindering his advance. By the time Sun Jian reached Luoyang, it had been largely destroyed by fires set by Dong Zhuo, whose forces fled westwards to Chang&#x27;an, abducting the emperor. However, his soldiers found the Imperial Seal, which Sun Jian was compelled to give to Yuan Shu.

=== Rule in Nanyang and Chenliu (190–193) ===
Yuan Shu&#x27;s rule in Nanyang was despotic. After the dissension of the alliance against Dong Zhuo in 191, he vied with Yuan Shao over control of northern China, each establishing opposing alliances. Yuan Shu allied with Yuan Shao&#x27;s northern rival Gongsun Zan, and Yuan Shao in turn allied with Yuan Shu&#x27;s southern rival Liu Biao. Yuan Shu sent Sun Jian to attack Liu Biao, but his proxy was killed in the Battle of Xiangyang (191). Sun Jian&#x27;s nephew Sun Ben took over Sun Jian&#x27;s command and formally joined Yuan Shu, who granted him the title of Inspector of Yu Province. After this defeat and his unpopularity due to his extravagant regime in Nanyang, Yuan Shu moved his residence to Chenliu, and extended his influence into Yang Province in 192.

=== Warlord in Shouchun (193–197) ===

In early 193, Yuan Shu suffered repeated defeats, such as the Battle of Fengqiu, by the combined armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao. He fled to Shouchun in Jiujiang (present day Shou County, Anhui) on the southern bank of the Huai River. From his new headquarters, he built up a powerful warlord state. He deposed Inspector Chen Wen of Yang Province and took the title for himself, also claiming to be Lord of Xu Province.

From 194 to early 197, Sun Jian&#x27;s son Sun Ce and brother-in-law Wu Jing conquered many territories in Jiangdong on Yuan Shu&#x27;s behalf. He was less successful in expanding his rule in Xu Province, where he fought against Liu Bei and Lü Bu; the latter briefly allied himself to Yuan Shu in 196, but betrayed him again and drove him back to Shouchun.

=== Emperor of Zhongshi Dynasty (197–199) ===

Yuan Shu declared himself emperor under the short-lived Zhongshi () dynasty in early 197, citing superstition as his justification, including the Chinese characters for his given name &quot;Shu&quot; and courtesy name &quot;Gonglu&quot;, and his possession of the Imperial Seal, which was given to him by the late Sun Jian. This audacious action made him a target of the other warlords. His extravagant lifestyle and arrogance caused many of his followers to desert him. Most devastating of the departures and defections – both to Yuan Shu personally and to the strength of his forces – was that by Sun Ce, who had conquered most of the Jiangdong territories under Yuan Shu&#x27;s banner. Following crushing defeats by the armies of Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Lü Bu, Yuan Shu attempted to flee north to join Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao sent his eldest son, Yuan Tan, to try to aid Yuan Shu; however, an alliance between the Yuan brothers who had long hated each other would not arise, as Yuan Tan arrived too late, and Yuan Shu&#x27;s forces were blocked and forced to retreat back to Shouchun by Liu Bei. He died shortly thereafter of starvation, being unable to swallow the coarse food that his soldiers ate. His final request was for a glass of honey water, which his soldiers had none.

Yuan Yao&#x27;s daughter married Sun Fen (), the fifth son of Sun Quan.
** Lady Yuan (), daughter, personal name unknown, became one of Sun Quan&#x27;s concubines after she and her brother were captured. She was known for good character but did not give birth. Sun Quan let her raise children which were born by other concubines, however, all the children that she raised died at early ages. When Lady Bu died in 238, Sun Quan wanted to instate Lady Yuan as the empress. Lady Yuan refused with the reason of having no child.

<text>Jean Dorst (7 August 1924 – 8 August 2001) was a French ornithologist.

Dorst was born at Mulhouse and studied biology and paleontology at the Faculty of Biological Sciences of the University of Paris. In 1947 he joined the staff of the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle. He succeeded Jacques Berlioz as chairman of Mammifères et Oiseaux in 1964, and was elected as director of the museum in 1975, resigning in 1985 to protest against government reforms of the museum.

Dorst was a member of the Académie des Sciences, one of the founders and second president of the Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos, president of the 16th International Ornithological Congress (IOC), and vice president of the Commission of Protection of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Dorst was one of the writers of the documentary &quot;Le Peuple Migrateur&quot; (&quot;Winged Migration&quot;), and the film is dedicated to him. A companion volume of photographs and essays was published in 2003.

<text>John of Leiden (born Johan Beukelszoon; 2 February 1509 – 22 January 1536) was a Dutch Anabaptist leader. In 1533 he moved to Münster, capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, where he became an influential prophet, turned the city into a millenarian Anabaptist theocracy, and proclaimed himself King of New Jerusalem in September 1534. The insurrection was suppressed in June 1535 after Prince-Bishop Franz von Waldeck besieged the city and captured John. John was tortured to death in the city&#x27;s central marketplace on 22 January 1536, along with Bernhard Knipperdolling and Bernhard Krechting.

==Life==
John was the illegitimate son of a Dutch mayor, and a tailor&#x27;s apprentice by trade. He was born in the village of Zevenhoven in the municipality of Nieuwkoop, located in the Dutch province of South Holland. Raised in poverty, young John became a charismatic leader who was widely revered by his followers. John was an Anabaptist, secretly at first, but later he became a recognized prophet of a sect which would eventually take over the German town of Münster. According to his own testimony, he moved to Münster in 1533 because he had heard there were inspired preachers there. He sent for Jan Matthys, who had baptized him, to come.

After his arrival Matthys – recognized as a prophet – became the principal leader of the city. Matthys expelled all of the Catholics from the city shortly after his arrival and set up a communal structure based on the Gospels. He outlawed money and forbade owning property. A Catholic supported army, led by Franz von Waldeck, Prince-Bishop of Münster, Osnabrück and Minden, laid siege to the town of Münster after the Anabaptist takeover. Matthys led an assault on the siege on Easter Sunday 1534, but died quickly. John of Leiden became a self-proclaimed &quot;king of the New Jerusalem&quot; until its fall in June 1535.
John of Leiden would lead the Anabaptists during the siege. When he was the leader, he assumed Matthys&#x27; position as the prophet and eventually established a Royal Order complete with a Royal Court and a kingly costume, which was made from the property taken from the citizens of Münster. John of Leiden would make many promises to his starving subjects about salvation from the siege and upcoming rewards for their enduring loyalty. This, along with his charisma, kept his position in the city secure until the eventual defeat by the hands of the prince bishop. His motto was: &quot;Gottes macht is myn cracht&quot; (God&#x27;s might is my strength).
The army of Münster was defeated in 1535 by the prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck. John of Leiden was captured. He was found in the cellar of a house, from where he was taken to a dungeon in Dülmen, then brought back to Münster. On 22 January 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour.

After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that, the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three iron baskets and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert&#x27;s Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the baskets remain.

==Historiography==
The conventional view is that John of Leiden set up in Münster a polygamous theocracy, best known for a law John passed stating that any unmarried woman must accept the first proposal of marriage made to her, with the result that men competed to acquire the most wives. Some sources report that John himself took sixteen wives aside from his &quot;Queen&quot; Divara van Haarlem, and that he publicly beheaded one of his wives, Elisabeth Wandscherer, after she rebelled against his authority.

Karl Kautsky in his &quot;Communism in Central Europe at the Time of the Reformation&quot;, notes that this picture of Anabaptist Münster is based almost entirely on accounts written by the Anabaptists&#x27; enemies, who sought to justify their bloody reconquest of the city. Kautsky&#x27;s reading of the sources emphasizes the Anabaptists&#x27; emphasis on social equality, political democracy, and communal living during the time of John&#x27;s nominal rule.

<doc id="774185" wikidata="Q3545665" url="?curid=774185" title="Juan dela Cruz">
<text>Juan de la Cruz or Maria de la Cruz (feminized form) is the national personification of the Philippines, often used to represent the &quot;Filipino everyman&quot;. He is usually depicted wearing the native &quot;salakot&quot; hat, barong tagalog, long pants, and &quot;tsinelas&quot; (local term for the popular flip-flops).

==History==

Juan dela Cruz was invented by Robert McCulloch-Dick, the editor and publisher of &quot;Philippines Free Press&quot;, founded in 1908. He noticed the frequency with which the names appeared on police blotters and court dockets. He was also notified that the Philippine Catholic Church baptized a large number of children, giving them names of popular saints. He often wrote small verses about Juan dela Cruz in &quot;Free Press&quot;, and narrations of the petty crimes committed by them. 

Later on, McCulloch-Dick widened his idea until he made Juan dela Cruz a character representative of a typical Filipino. Juan dela Cruz is associated with the image of a naïve-looking man wearing a &quot;salakot&quot;, &quot;camisa de chino&quot;, native trousers, and slippers. Jorge Pineda, resident cartoonist of &quot;Free Press&quot;, first drew the image of Juan in 1946.

==Usage==

Activists often portray Juan dela Cruz as a victim of American imperialism, especially since many editorial cartoons of the American period often depicted him alongside Uncle Sam either as a &quot;Little Brown Brother&quot; or as an Asian Partner. In modern times, he is shown independently as a venue for the common Filipino&#x27;s commentary on governmental and social issues.

The term, sometimes shortened to &quot;Juan&quot;, also refers to the collective Filipino psyche.

The name (Spanish for &quot;John of the Cross&quot;) is often used as a placeholder name for an anonymous individual, roughly the equivalent of the American John Doe. The feminine placeholder is usually María dela Cruz, which like Juan is a common first name among Filipino women, though Juana dela Cruz is currently gaining popularity in Philippine television and especially in political campaigns by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

==See also==
* Juan Tamad, or &quot;Lazy John&quot; – another character common in Filipino culture and literature.
* María Clara, from the novel &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; by national hero José Rizal, refers to the idealised Filipina (analogous to the Japanese &quot;Yamato nadeshiko&quot;).

<text>Charley Eugene Johns (February 27, 1905January 23, 1990) was an American politician. Johns served as the 32nd Governor of Florida from 1953 to 1955.

Johns was born in Starke, Florida. He worked as a railroad conductor
and insurance before being elected to the State Senate as a Democrat in 1947. Johns became the Senate President in April 1953, a position Markley Johns, his brother, had been elected to. Johns was a member of the &quot;Pork Chop Gang&quot;, a group of 20 conservative legislators from North Florida who favored racial segregation and consolidated political power and money in the northern, more rural parts of the state. One of the Johns most remembered initiatives during his early state Senate years was to build a new, portable electric chair to be transported by truck with an electric generator and set up in a jail or a courthouse where the convicted was sentenced.

After the death of Governor Dan McCarty on September 28, 1953, Johns became the Acting Governor under the provisions of the state constitution at that time, which provided for the state Senate President to become the Acting Governor upon the death, incapacitation, or resignation of the Governor. During his term as Acting Governor, Johns promoted highway construction, eliminating tolls on the Overseas Highway between Miami and Key West. He was also an advocate for prison reform. In 1954, Johns ran for election to a term as governor in his own right, but was defeated by LeRoy Collins. After leaving office on January 4, 1955, he returned to the Florida Senate, serving until 1966.

Johns is most remembered for his support and chairmanship of the infamous Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, nicknamed the &quot;Johns Committee&quot; because of Johns&#x27; chairmanship. This committee participated in the Red Scare and Lavender scare by investigating communists, homosexuals, and civil rights advocates among the students and faculty of Florida&#x27;s university system. They were responsible for revoking teachers&#x27; certificates and firing university professors. By 1963, the committee had forced the dismissal or resignation of over 100 professors and deans at the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of South Florida. One professor, Sigismond Diettrich, chair of the geography department of the University of Florida, attempted suicide after being investigated by the committee. The state legislature ended funding for the committee in 1964 after it released a report called &quot;Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida&quot;, which infamously became known as the &quot;Purple Pamphlet&quot;. Its many photographs depicting homosexual acts outraged legislators and reportedly copies of the report were being sold as pornography in New York City.

<text>James Lee Peters (August 13, 1889 – April 19, 1952) was an American ornithologist.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Dr. Austin Peters and Francis Howie Lee on August 13, 1889. His early education was at the Roxbury Latin School, followed by his acceptance to Harvard University, where he graduated in 1912.

Peters interest in natural history developed early. His early collecting trips included traveling with Arthur Cleveland Bent, Charles Haskins Townsend and H.K. Job to the Magdalen Islands. Three of Peters early mentors were Charles Johnson Maynard, judge Charles Jenney and Outram Bangs.

Ultimately, Peters was Curator of Birds at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, at Harvard University. He served as president of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1942–45, and also served as president of International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature for a period.

Peters is best known for his multi-volume &quot;Check-list of Birds of the World&quot; (1931–52), widely referred to simply as the &quot;Peters&#x27; check-list&quot;. Compared to earlier check-lists written by Richard Bowdler Sharpe, the list by Peters made several significant advances, among others using subspecies (trinomial nomenclature), which Bowdler&#x27;s had not. For the first four volumes Peters was awarded the Brewster Medal. Peters died before finishing the work, and the last volumes, as well as updates to some of the first, were completed by Ernst Mayr, James Greenway, Melvin Alvah Traylor, Jr. and others, with the final being volume 16 published in 1987. This check-list has been highly influential in ornithology, and has – either directly or indirectly – been used as a basis for numerous modern check-lists such as &quot;The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; by James Clements, &quot;The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; edited by Edward C. Dickinson, &quot;Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World&quot; by Charles Sibley and Burt Monroe, the &quot;AOU Checklist of North American Birds&quot; by AOU, and the check-list to birds of South America by SACC.

<text>Zoutkamp (; ) is a village in the municipality Het Hogeland which is part of the province Groningen in the Netherlands. The village started as a sconce. During the Dutch Revolt, it was the site of the Battle of Zoutkamp. Later it became a fishing village. The harbour was moved to Lauwersoog in 1969 as a result of the closure of the Lauwersmeer, and is nowadays used for recreational purposes. The economy of the village mainly depends on fishing.

== History ==
Zoutkamp was first mentioned in documents in 1418 as &quot;Soltcampum&quot;. Its first inhabitants might have been soldiers. Its name refers to salt and field, which probably means that it was a place for salt production.

During the Dutch Revolt, the city of Groningen sided with Spain. Most of the Ommelanden (country side) and the province of Friesland opted for the Dutch Republic. In 1576, a sconce was built at Zoutkamp by the Spanish. In 1589, the sconce was conquered in the by the Dutch Republic under the command of William Louis of Nassau. On 22 July 1594, after the Siege of Groningen, Groningen was forced to side with Dutch Republic.

During the 17th and 18th century, fishers settled in Zoutkamp. By 1756, Zoutkamp consisted of 25 houses. In 1828, a harbour was constructed, and the church was built in 1836. In 1840, the population had increased to 720 people. In 1882, the fortification was demolished and the military function of Zoutkamp ceased. During World War II, between 80 and 100 soldiers of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; were stationed near Zoutkamp, however the village saw little action.

== Lauwersmeer ==
In the 1950s, there were calls to close the Lauwerszee, the bay near which Zoutkamp was located. As part of the Zuiderzee Works, it was decided to build a dike between Friesland and Groningen, and turn the bay into Lauwersmeer. In 1969, the dike was completed, and a harbour was constructed at Lauwersoog. The province of Groningen intended to use the harbour for recreational purposes only, because they were constructing the Eemshaven, as a new main harbour. Zoutkamp and the province of Friesland desired a commercial harbour. In January 1970, the conflict was brought to the States General of the Netherlands.

Lauwersoog became a successful fishing harbour, however the fishers of Zoutkamp still use the registration &quot;ZK&quot; instead of &quot;LO&quot; to indicate their place of origin. The harbour of Zoutkamp is nowadays for recreational boats only. The ferry to Schiermonnikoog which used to depart from Zoutkamp and Oostmahorn was moved to Lauwersoog.

== Recent history ==
Until 2008, Zoutkamp was the site of a ground station of the Dutch &quot;Nationale SIGINT Organisatie&quot; (National Signals Intelligence Service), which intercepted satellite communications much like the U.S. National Security Agency.

The economy of Zoutkamp is still based on fishing and the village is not subject to a move to the city. As a result, it still has a lively centre with much retail. In 2019, it became part of the municipality of Het Hogeland.

<doc id="774201" wikidata="Q909284" url="?curid=774201" title="Cooper test">
<text>The Cooper test which was designed by Kenneth H. Cooper in 1968 for US military use is a physical fitness test. In its original form, the point of the test is to run as far as possible within 12 minutes. Pacing is important, as the participant will not cover a maximal distance if they begin with a pace too close to an all out sprint. The outcome is based on the distance the test person ran, their age and their sex.

It is a vert hard test to perform in larger groups. For athletes, the length of the run is considered to be that of a short distance run, since everything above 3 km is rated &quot;long distance&quot;—which means the runner will primarily use their &quot;red&quot;, slow oxidative muscle cells.

For comparison the 2 miles (3,218.7 meters) world best is 7:54.10 set by Jakob Ingebrigtsen and the 5000 meters outdoor world record of Joshua Cheptegei is 12:35.36. With the same average speed, this would give 4768 metres for the Cooper test. The 2 miles world best for women is held by Meseret Defar with 8:58.58 and Faith Kipyegon&#x27;s world record time for the outdoor 5000 meters is 14:05.20.

==Interpretation of results==
The following is an example of the many tables that exist for the test:

=== VO2 max estimate ===
The results can be correlated with VO2 max by inverting the linear regression values presented in the original publication.

Formula:

:formula_1

where d12 is distance (in metres) covered in 12 minutes, alternatively

:formula_2

where d(miles)12 is distance (in miles) covered in 12 minutes.

== Practical use ==
For practical use, precise monitoring presents a challenge. Not all military bases have a running track, and tracking soldiers&#x27; laps and positions after 12 minutes is difficult. Testing is easier to administer when the distance is fixed and the finishing time measured. In his original book, Cooper also provided an alternate version of the test, based on the time to complete a 1.5 mile run.

Most armies and police agencies of the world use a fixed distance. This is not exactly a Cooper test but a reasonable practical compromise as long as the distance is of sufficient length to put a continuous load on the cardiovascular system for 10 or more minutes. For example, the British Army uses 1.5 miles, the Australian Army uses 2.4 kilometers, the US Army uses 2 miles and the US Marine Corps 3 miles. For each base the course is measured and local corrections (elevation, conditions, etc.) applied. Soldiers are sent off in waves, and timed over the finish line by some PTIs with a stopwatch.

For personal trainers, the Cooper Test, when carried out on a treadmill, is a reliable and repeatable method for measuring a client&#x27;s progress.

As a standard test this test should to be performed only under standard conditions:

* Between 50 and 75 °F (10 to 25 °C) with 75% maximum humidity.
* On a standard 400 m Tartan track or similar.
* The candidate should not suffer from respiratory problems.

The test formula given by Cooper is not considered to be useful for untrained pupils.
Regression analysis within in a study of sedentary male subjects revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.93, P&lt;0.001) with direct VO2Max measurements with a modified formula: 

:formula_3

where d(kilometers)12 is distance (in kilometers) covered in 12 minutes.

== Football referees ==
The Cooper test was one of the most commonly used fitness tests to measure the fitness levels of both amateur and professional football referees, including referees from the FA (English Football Association). More recently, many countries have decided to stop relying on the Cooper Test, claiming that the Cooper test does not correlate well to a real football match, where players run short sprints rather than at a regular pace. Thus it may not truly indicate if a referee will be able to perform well in a football match. All FIFA referees are now required to pass the HI Intensity Fitness Test. National associations are gradually requiring some of their top-tier officials to do the HI Intensity Fitness Test also. Lower level referees are often given a choice to either perform the HI Intensity Fitness Test or the Cooper Test. Nevertheless, the recent trend seems to indicate that the Cooper Test is slowly being phased out.

<text>Jonathan Eastman Johnson (July 29, 1824 – April 5, 1906) was an American painter and co-founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, with his name inscribed at its entrance. He was best known for his genre paintings, paintings of scenes from everyday life, and his portraits both of everyday people and prominent Americans such as Abraham Lincoln, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His later works often show the influence of the 17th-century Dutch masters, whom he studied in The Hague in the 1850s; he was known as &quot;The American Rembrandt&quot; in his day.

== Life ==
Johnson was born in Lovell, Maine, one of the eight children of Philip Carrigan Johnson and Mary Kimball Chandler (born in New Hampshire, October 18, 1796, married 1818). His siblings were brothers Reuben and Philip, sisters Harriet, Judith, Mary, Sarah and Nell. (His younger brother Philip became a Commodore in the United States Navy and father of Vice Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson.)

Eastman grew up in Fryeburg and Augusta, where the family lived at Pleasant Street and later at 61 Winthrop Street. His father was the owner of several businesses, and active in fraternal organizations: he was Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Maine (ancient Free and Accepted Masons) (1836–1844). He was appointed in 1840 as Secretary of State for Maine, serving two years.
==Career==
Eastman Johnson&#x27;s career as an artist began when his father apprenticed him in 1840 to a Boston lithographer. After his father&#x27;s political patron, the Governor of Maine John Fairfield, entered the US Senate, the senior Johnson was appointed by US President James Polk in the late 1840s as Chief Clerk in the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repair of the Navy Department. The family moved to Washington, DC and first lived in rental housing. In 1853, they bought a new rowhouse at 266 F Street, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth streets and a few blocks from the White House and the Navy Department offices, which became their permanent home. Although the young Johnson lived for a time in Boston, and studied in Europe, he used this home as his base until moving to New York City in the late 1850s.

The young Johnson moved to Washington, D.C. at about age 20, supporting himself by making crayon portraits, including John Quincy Adams, and Dolly Madison, and likely helped by his father&#x27;s political connections. He returned to New England, settling in Boston in 1846 at the age of 22.

In 1849, Johnson went overseas to Germany, for further studies at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. This had become a new center where many artists, including many Americans, studied art. They took part in the Düsseldorf school of painting. 
In January 1851, Johnson was accepted into the studio of Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a German who had lived in the United States for a while before returning to Germany. His major work completed there is his portrait of Worthington Whittredge.Johnson moved to The Hague, where he studied 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters. He ended his European travels in Paris, studying with the academic painter Thomas Couture in 1855 before returning to the United States that year due to the death of his mother.

In 1856, he visited his sister Sarah and her family in Superior, Wisconsin. His mixed-race guide Stephen Bonga, who was Ojibwe and African-American, took Johnson among the native Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) in the areas around Superior. Throughout 1857 Johnson frequently painted them in intimate, casual poses. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, Johnson traveled with Bonga to the areas today known as Grand Portage National Monument, Apostle Islands National Monument, and Isle Royale National Park.

By 1859, Johnson had returned to the East and established a studio in New York City. He secured his reputation as an American artist that year with an exhibit at the National Academy of Design featuring his painting, &quot;Negro Life at the South&quot; (1859) or, as it was popularly called, &quot;Old Kentucky Home.&quot; It was set in the urban back yards of Washington, DC rather than on a plantation. That year Johnson was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1860.

Johnson also became a member of the Union League Club of New York, which holds many of his paintings. In 1869, at the age of 55, he married for the first time, to Elizabeth Buckley. They had one daughter, Ethel Eastman Johnson, born in 1870. Ethel married Alfred Ronalds Conkling (nephew of Senator Roscoe Conkling) in 1896.
When he died in 1906 at age 81, Eastman Johnson was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Style==
Johnson&#x27;s style is largely realistic in both subject matter and in execution. His charcoal sketches were not strongly influenced by period artists, but are informed more by his lithography training. Later works show influence by the 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters, and also by Jean-François Millet. Echoes of Millet&#x27;s &quot;The Gleaners&quot; can be seen in Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Cranberry Harvest, Island of Nantucket,&quot; although the emotional tone of the work is far different.

His careful portrayal of individuals rather than stereotypes enhances the realism of his paintings. Ojibwe artist Carl Gawboy notes that the faces in the 1857 portraits of Ojibwe people by Johnson are recognizable in people in the Ojibwe community today. Some of his paintings, such as &quot;Ojibwe Wigwam at Grand Portage,&quot; are highly realistic, with details seen in the later photorealism movement.

His careful attention to light sources contributes to the realism. Portraits, &quot;Girl and Pets&quot; and &quot;The Boy Lincoln,&quot; make use of single light sources in a manner that is similar to the 17th-century Dutch Masters whom he had studied in The Hague in the 1850s.

==Subject matter==

===Portraits===

Johnson&#x27;s subject matter included portraits of the wealthy and influential, from the President of the United States, to literary figures, to unnamed individuals. He is best known for his paintings of everyday people in everyday scenes. Johnson often repainted the same subject changing style or details.

===New England===
His works of New England life, such as &quot;The Cranberry Harvest, Island of Nantucket&quot;, &quot;The Old Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;Husking Bee, Island of Nantucket&quot;, &quot;The Sap Gatherers&quot;, and &quot;Sugaring Off at the Camp, Fryeburg, Maine,&quot; established him as a genre painter. Over the course of five years, he made many sketches and smaller paintings of the processing of maple sap into maple sugar, but never completed the larger work he had started.

In contrast, he developed the much celebrated &quot;Old Stagecoach&quot; mostly in his studio, and he carefully planned its composition. The stage coach was based on an abandoned coach which he had come across and sketched while hiking in the Catskills. He used local children recruited as models from near his Nantucket studio. Despite this artifice, the painting was celebrated as wholesome, natural and bucolic.

===Ojibwe===

In 1856–1857, Johnson visited his sister Sarah and brother in Superior on the western frontier of Wisconsin at Lake Superior. He was aided in traveling in the area and in meeting Ojibwe people by Stephen Bonga, an interpreter and guide of Ojibwe/African-American parents.

Carl Gawboy, a modern-day Ojibwe artist, speculates that Johnson&#x27;s time with Bonga and his mixed-race family (Bonga had an Ojibwe wife as well as mother) changed his approach to painting. Certainly Johnson was successful in getting many Ojibwe to sit for him as subjects. In his drawings and paintings, Johnson portrayed Ojibwe people in a more intimate and relaxed manner than was usual for paintings of that period. Also unusual was that he often included the subject&#x27;s names in the titles of the works. He did not focus solely on individual portraits, but also did paintings and sketches of scenes which include Ojibwe dwellings, St. Louis Bay, and other groupings of Ojibwe in everyday activities.

Johnson left Wisconsin due to a widespread financial panic, which rendered his real estate investments there worthless. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to earn money by portrait commissions, and never returned to the subject of the Ojibwe.
His paintings and sketches of the Ojibwe remained unsold during his lifetime. They are now owned by the St. Louis County Historical Society in Duluth, Minnesota.

===Slavery===
&quot;Negro Life at the South&quot; (1859), completed shortly before the Civil War began, is considered Johnson&#x27;s masterpiece. Because of its complexity, it has been analyzed and interpreted at length by scholars. The painting depicts an urban &quot;back street&quot; scene of slaves in Washington, DC, although it became popularly known from that year as &quot;Old Kentucky Home&quot; (based on the song &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; by Stephen Foster) and was referred to as showing plantation life. The painting shows a range of domestic activities behind a dilapidated house, with a house of better condition to the right. (The setting is the backyard of slave quarters near Johnson&#x27;s father&#x27;s house in Washington.)

On the left in the foreground are a young black man and light-skinned woman courting, in the middle is a banjo player making music, where an adult woman dances with a child, as others look on. At the right edge, a young white woman in a refined white dress steps over a threshold from the house next door into this world, with another black figure behind her. (She is Johnson&#x27;s sister.) An adult black woman looks out an upstairs window as she steadies a small light-skinned child sitting on the partially collapsed roof. The woman dancing with the child in the middle foreground has the darkest skin; nearly each individual is painted with a different skin tone.

These variations among &quot;people of color&quot; reflect African-American society of the Upper South, but also invite the viewer to contemplate the mixed racial ancestry of those portrayed. Several elements hint at or symbolize relations to an unseen wealthier white father—the mulatto children, the ladder from the Negro quarters up to a larger house next door and, symbolically, the rooster high in the tree near the taller house and hen on the Negroes&#x27; house roof. Both proponents and detractors of slavery perceived this painting as supporting their world views, because the Negroes seem cheerful enough, but their house is dilapidated.

&quot;A Ride for Liberty – The Fugitive Slaves&quot; (1862), which depicts a slave family riding at dawn to freedom, also invites interpretation. Johnson places the slave family squarely in the center of the work, acting as agents of their own destiny. It appears to be dawn and in the distance is light on bayonets, indicating Union lines. A man rides with a child in front of him; behind him, a woman holds an infant close to her chest. She looks behind her as if worried about pursuers, or wondering what she left behind. Curator Eleanor Harvey writes the painting &quot;captures the moment when the full scope of the slavery question begins to loom. Johnson placed these people squarely in the foreground and, in doing so, elevated their plight in the national debate.&quot;
Johnson noted at the time that the painting is based on his observations during the Civil War Battle of Manassas.

His work, &quot;The Lord is My Shepherd&quot; (1863), shows an African-American man reading from the Bible, presumably from Psalm chapter 23, given the name of Eastman&#x27;s work. Here he sits against a blue jacket that may indicate service in the Union army. It was painted soon after the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation, by which many blacks made their exodus from slavery to freedom. Reading was seen as key to the ability of freedmen to make progress.

<text>Esther Johnson (13 March 1681 – 28 January 1728) was an Englishwoman known to have been a close friend of Jonathan Swift, known as &quot;Stella&quot;. Whether or not she and Swift were secretly married, and if so why the marriage was never made public, is a subject of debate.

==Parentage and early life==
She was born in Richmond, Surrey, and spent her early years at Moor Park, Farnham, home of Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet. Here, when she was about eight, she met Swift, who was Temple&#x27;s secretary: he took a friendly interest in her from the beginning and apparently supervised her education.

Her parentage has been the subject of much speculation. The weight of evidence is that her mother acted as companion to Temple&#x27;s widowed sister, Martha, Lady Giffard, and that Stella, her mother and her sister Anne (who married a Mr Firlby) were regarded as part of the family. Stella&#x27;s father is said to have been a merchant who died young: gossip that she was Temple&#x27;s illegitimate daughter seems to rest on nothing more solid than the friendly interest he showed in her (there were similar rumours about his supposed relationship with Swift).

==Friendship with Swift==
When Swift saw her again in 1696 he considered that she had grown into the &quot;most beautiful, graceful and agreeable young woman in London&quot;. Temple at his death in 1699 left her some property in Ireland; it was at Swift&#x27;s suggestion that she move to Ireland in 1702 to protect her interests, but her long residence there, like Vanessa&#x27;s, was probably due to a desire to be close to Swift. She generally lived in Swift&#x27;s house, though always with female companions like Rebecca Dingley, a cousin of Temple whom she had known since childhood. Esther became extremely popular in Dublin and an intellectual circle grew up around her, although it was said that she found the company of other women tedious and only enjoyed the conversation of men.

In 1704 their mutual friend, the Reverend William Tisdall, told Swift that he wished to marry Stella, much to Swift&#x27;s private disgust, although his letter to Tisdall, which outlined his objections to the marriage, was courteous enough, making the practical point that Tisdall was not in a position to support a wife financially. Little is known about this episode, other than Swift&#x27;s letter to Tisdall. It is unclear if Tisdall actually proposed to Stella: if he did he seems to have met with a firm rejection, and he married Eleanor Morgan two years later. He and Swift, after a long estrangement, became friends once more after Stella&#x27;s death.

==Vanessa==

Stella&#x27;s friendship with Swift became fraught after 1707 when he met Esther Vanhomrigh, daughter of the Dutch-born Lord Mayor of Dublin. Swift became deeply attached to her and invented for her the name &quot;Vanessa&quot;. She in turn became infatuated with him and after his return to Ireland followed him there. The uneasy relationship between the three of them continued until 1723 when Vanessa (who was by now seriously ill from tuberculosis) apparently asked Swift not to see Stella again. This led to a violent quarrel between them, and Vanessa before her death in June 1723 destroyed the will she had made in Swift&#x27;s favour, leaving her property to two men, George Berkeley and Robert Marshall, who though eminent in their respective callings were almost strangers to her.

==Secret marriage==
Whether Swift and Stella were married has always been a subject of intense debate. The marriage ceremony was allegedly performed in 1716 by St George Ashe, Bishop of Clogher (an old friend of Swift, and also his college tutor), with no witnesses present, and it was said that the parties agreed to keep it secret and live apart. Stella always described herself as a &quot;spinster&quot; and Swift always referred to himself as unmarried; Rebecca Dingley, who lived with Stella throughout her years in Ireland, said that Stella and Swift were never alone together. Those who knew the couple best were divided on whether a marriage ever took place: some, like Mrs. Dingley and Swift&#x27;s housekeeper Mrs. Brent laughed at the idea as &quot;absurd&quot;. On the other hand, Thomas Sheridan, one of Swift&#x27;s oldest friends, believed that the story of the marriage was true: he reportedly gave Stella herself as his source. Historians have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on the truth of the matter: Bishop Ashe died before the story first became public, and there were no other witnesses to the supposed marriage.

==Writings==
A collection of her witticisms was published by Swift under the titles of &quot;Bon Mots de Stella&quot; as an appendix to some editions of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.&quot; Journal to Stella&quot;, a collection of 65 letters from Swift to Stella, was published posthumously.

==Last years and death==

In 1722, Martha, Lady Giffard died and she left money to Esther and Swift&#x27;s sister Mrs Fenton who had been her companion in 1711.

Her health began to fail in her mid-forties. In 1726 she was thought to be dying; Swift rushed back from London to be with her but found her better. The following year it became clear that she was gravely ill. After sinking slowly for months she died on 28 January 1728, and was buried in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. Jonathan Swift was inconsolable at Esther&#x27;s death and wrote &quot;The Death of Mrs. Johnson&quot; in tribute to her; when he died he was buried beside her at his own request. A ward in St Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital is named &quot;Stella&quot; in her memory.

==Portrayals==
In the 1994 film &quot;Words Upon the Window Pane&quot;, based on the play by William Butler Yeats, Stella is played by Brid Brennan. The plot turns on a seance in Dublin in the 1920s, where the ghosts of Swift, Stella and Vanessa appear to resume their ancient quarrel.

In the 1982 Soviet film &quot;The House That Swift Built&quot;, Stella is played by Aleksandra Zakharova.

== Publications (fiction) ==
*&quot;The Basilisk of St. James&quot; (London, 1945, Chapman and Hall) by Elizabeth Myers, wife of Littleton C. Powys, who was a brother of John Cowper Powys. The novel has as its main protagonist Jonathan Swift. Central to the plot is the personal conflict that arose from Swift&#x27;s relationships with both Esther Vanhomrigh (Vanessa) and Esther Johnson (Stella).

<text>Harold Keith &quot;Johnny&quot; Johnson (22 February 1912 – 24 September 1983) was a United States Army general who served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1964 to 1968. Regarded as a premier tactician, Johnson became skeptical that the level of resources given to the Vietnam War, much of which went into &#x27;find, fix, and destroy the big main force units&#x27; operations, could deliver victory. Johnson came to believe that the Communist forces held a trump card, because they controlled whether there were engagements with U.S. forces, giving an option to simply avoid battle with U.S. forces if the situation warranted it.

==Early life==

Harold Keith Johnson was born in Bowesmont, North Dakota, on 22 February 1912. After graduation from high school in 1929, Johnson attended the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. On June 13, 1933, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry. Johnson&#x27;s first duty assignment was with the 3rd Infantry (Old Guard) at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.

==Military career==
In 1938, Johnson attended Infantry School at Fort Benning. Upon graduation, he was assigned to the 28th Infantry at Fort Niagara, New York. Requesting an overseas transfer, Johnson was reassigned to the 57th Infantry (Philippine Scouts) at Fort McKinley, Philippine Islands in 1940.

===World War II===
After the Battle of Bataan, Johnson became a prisoner of war (POW) of the Japanese on 9 April 1942. Participating in the Bataan Death March, Johnson was eventually imprisoned at Camp O&#x27;Donnell, Cabanatuan and Bilibid Prison. In December 1944, the Japanese attempted to transfer Johnson and 1600 other POWs out of the Philippines. On 14 December 1944, American fighter planes sank the Japanese ship &quot;Ōryoku Maru&quot;, killing over 300 of the POWs. Johnson survived and was eventually transferred to Japan. Unwilling to give up their POWs to the advancing Allies, Japan again transferred Johnson. Finally ending up in Inchon Prison Korea, Johnson was liberated by the 7th Infantry Division on 7 September 1945.

===Korean War and rise to senior command===
After Johnson&#x27;s return to the United States, his first assignment was with the Ground Forces School. In August 1946, he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he remained as an instructor for another two years. Johnson next attended the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1949. After graduation, he was assigned as commanding officer, 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

Johnson organized the 1st Provisional Infantry Battalion at Fort Devens and, in August 1950, he was dispatched to Korea. The battalion became the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division for the defense of the Pusan Perimeter. Still with the 1st Cavalry Division, Johnson was later promoted to command the 5th and the 8th Cavalry Regiments. In February 1951, he was reassigned as Assistant Chief of Staff, G3 of I Corps.

Returning to the United States, Johnson was assigned to the Office of the Chief of the Army Field Forces, Fort Monroe, Virginia. In 1952, he attended the National War College. After graduation, Johnson was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G3, where he served first, as Chief of Joint War Plans Branch, then as the Assistant to the Chief of the Plans Division, and finally as the Executive Officer of the Assistant Chief of Staff.

In January 1956, Johnson was assigned to duty as Assistant Division Commander of the 8th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado. Later in 1956, he transferred with the 8th Division to West Germany. Johnson&#x27;s next assignment was as chief of staff, Seventh Army Headquarters at Stuttgart-Vaihingen. Then in April 1959, Johnson moved to Headquarters, United States Army Europe as Assistant Chief of Staff, G3. The following December, he was appointed chief of staff, Central Army Group at NATO Headquarters concerned with planning for the employment of French, German, and American troop operations in Central Europe.

Returning to the United States, Johnson was assigned as commandant, Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In February 1963, he became assistant deputy chief of staff for military operations (operations and plans), Department of the Army, and in July was appointed as deputy chief of staff for military operations.

===Chief of Staff===
On 3 July 1964, Johnson was appointed the 24th Chief of Staff of the United States Army; his reputation as an expert tactician led to him being selected over candidates with more seniority. He had told the National Guard Association that year that &quot;military force ... should be committed with the object beyond war in mind&quot; and &quot;broadly speaking, the object beyond war should be the restoration of stability with the minimum of destruction, so that society and lawful government may proceed in an atmosphere of justice and order.&quot;

====Vietnam War====
Johnson went to Vietnam in December 1965 after the Battle of Ia Drang. He &quot;concluded that it had not been a victory at all and that Westmoreland&#x27;s big-unit strategy was misconceived&quot;. However, Johnson publicly said there was no alternative to disrupting enemy main force units in the Central Highlands as preventing them from establishing base areas in the middle of the country was essential. After talking to junior officers involved in the first major actions, Johnson concluded that enemy main force units had the ability to evade engagements, giving them the option to keep casualties below an acceptable level, but they were in fact accepting the actual kill ratios being achieved, as evidenced by them attacking United States forces. Johnson started the process to have Westmoreland replaced in Vietnam, and commissioned the PROVN Study, which noted that &quot;aerial attacks and artillery fire, applied indiscriminately, also have exacted a toll on village allegiance.&quot; There was a deep-seated reluctance among the Joint Chiefs of Staff to interfere with the command decisions of Westmoreland, but harassing artillery fire, by United States forces at least, was greatly reduced.

As Johnson saw it, the communist units would always keep their casualties below what they considered a prohibitive level, and could not be swept away by US firepower. He did, however, acknowledge that the U.S. Commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, had little choice but to engage the enemy&#x27;s main formations, which had to be prevented from securing base areas where they could concentrate. Johnson was instrumental in altering the focus to a counterinsurgency approach, but was frustrated at the US Congress&#x27; refusal to provide the manpower necessary for successful pacification. In his later years Johnson said it had been obvious that US national mobilization was required to win in Vietnam, and he regretted not resigning in protest at the government asking the army to fight a war without hope of ultimate victory.

====Conditions for enlisted personnel====
As Chief of Staff, one of Johnson&#x27;s noteworthy accomplishments was creating the office of the Sergeant Major of the Army to improve the quality of life for enlisted personnel. He selected Sergeant Major William O. Wooldridge to be the first to hold this post. Johnson also served as acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a few months in 1967 during the convalescence of General Earle Wheeler. Johnson retired from active duty in July 1968. For three years, General Johnson headed the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge and afterwards worked as a banking executive until retiring for good.

==Final years==
Johnson married Dorothy Rennix in 1935. During his term as chief of staff, he had been involved in many policy debates regarding the escalation of the Vietnam War as a proponent of full military mobilization to achieve a pacification of South Vietnam. He considered resigning in protest over President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s decision not to mobilize the reserves, and at the end of his life expressed regret at not doing so. He was the subject of a biography, &quot;Honorable Warrior&quot;, by Lewis Sorley. Johnson died on 24 September 1983, in Washington, D.C. Johnson came to regret not opposing the escalation of the Vietnam War, lamenting that &quot;I am now going to my grave with that lapse in moral courage on my back.&quot; He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===
:Johnson, Harold K.
:Lieutenant Colonel (Infantry), U.S. Army
:3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division
:Date of Action: 4 September 1950

:Citation:

The President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved 9 July 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel (Infantry) Harold K. Johnson, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of the 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces near Tabu-dong, Korea, on 4 September 1950. When his battalion had been forced to withdraw from their hill position by a series of fierce attacks by an overwhelming number of the enemy, Colonel Johnson immediately directed a counterattack in an attempt to regain the vitally important dominating terrain. Placing himself with the most forward elements in order to more effectively direct and coordinate the attack, Colonel Johnson rallied his men and led them forward. Moving about exposed to the heavy enemy artillery, mortar and small-arms fire, he directed fire, assigned positions and, by personal example, proved the necessary incentive to stimulate and keep the attack moving. When his battalion began to falter due to the devastating enemy fire, Colonel Johnson moved forward to close proximity of the enemy to establish and personally operate a forward observation post. Remaining in this exposed position, he directed effective mortar counter fire against the enemy. When his mortars became inoperable and his casualties very heavy due to the tremendous firepower and numerically superior enemy forces, he realized the necessity for withdrawal. Remaining in the position until the last unit had withdrawn, he directed the salvaging of both weapons and equipment. Reestablishing a new defensive position, he reorganized his battalion and supervised medical attention and evacuation of the wounded. His conspicuous devotion to duty and selfless conduct under enemy fire provided an inspiring example to his men and prevented a serious penetration of friendly lines.

<text>Herschel Vespasian Johnson (May 3, 1894 – April 16, 1966) was a U.S. diplomat from North Carolina. He was the great-grandson of Governor Herschel Vespasian Johnson. He served as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer from 1921 to 1953, and his career included posts in Europe, Latin America, and the United Nations.

He served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden between 12 December 1941 and 28 April 1946. Thereafter, he served as the acting US ambassador to the United Nations between 1946 and 1947. In 1948, he was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Brazil.

During his time in Sweden, he made humanitarian efforts to save civilian lives and was in touch with Raoul Wallenberg.

He was a vocal proponent of the 1947 Palestine Partition Plan. The outcome of the UN vote is attributed to his collaboration with Andrei A. Gromyko, otherwise Johnson&#x27;s political opponent. They both stood together on this issue and urged the General Assembly not to delay its decision but to vote for partition at once, opposing last-minute efforts of Arab delegations to effect a compromise.

<doc id="774220" wikidata="Q1208616" url="?curid=774220" title="Diamond anvil cell">
<text>A diamond anvil cell (DAC) is a high-pressure device used in geology, engineering, and materials science experiments. It permits the compression of a small (sub-millimeter-sized) piece of material to extreme pressures, typically up to around 100–200 gigapascals, although it is possible to achieve pressures up to 770 gigapascals (7,700,000 bars or 7.7 million atmospheres).

The device has been used to recreate the pressure existing deep inside planets to synthesize materials and phases not observed under normal ambient conditions. Notable examples include the non-molecular ice X, polymeric nitrogen and metallic phases of xenon, lonsdaleite, and potentially metallic hydrogen.

A DAC consists of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between the polished culets (tips). Pressure may be monitored using a reference material whose behavior under pressure is known. Common pressure standards include ruby fluorescence, and various structurally simple metals, such as copper or platinum. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium, such as argon, xenon, hydrogen, helium, paraffin oil or a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The pressure-transmitting medium is enclosed by a gasket and the two diamond anvils. The sample can be viewed through the diamonds and illuminated by X-rays and visible light. In this way, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence; optical absorption and photoluminescence; Mössbauer, Raman and Brillouin scattering; positron annihilation and other signals can be measured from materials under high pressure. Magnetic and microwave fields can be applied externally to the cell allowing nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and other magnetic measurements. Attaching electrodes to the sample allows electrical and magnetoelectrical measurements as well as heating up the sample to a few thousand degrees. Much higher temperatures (up to 7000 K) can be achieved with laser-induced heating, and cooling down to millikelvins has been demonstrated.

==Principle==
The operation of the diamond anvil cell relies on a simple principle:

:formula_1

where is the pressure, the applied force, and the area. Typical culet sizes for diamond anvils are 100–250 micrometres (μm), such that a very high pressure is achieved by applying a moderate force on a sample with a small area, rather than applying a large force on a large area. Diamond is a very hard and virtually incompressible material, thus minimising the deformation and failure of the anvils that apply the force.

==History==
The study of materials at extreme conditions, high pressure and high temperature uses a wide array of techniques to achieve these conditions and probe the behavior of material while in the extreme environment. Percy Williams Bridgman, the great pioneer of high-pressure research during the first half of the 20th century, revolutionized the field of high pressures with his development of an opposed anvil device with small flat areas that were pressed one against the other with a lever-arm. The anvils were made of tungsten carbide (WC). This device could achieve pressure of a few gigapascals, and was used in electrical resistance and compressibility measurements. 

The first diamond anvil cell was created in 1957-1958. The principles of the DAC are similar to the Bridgman anvils, but in order to achieve the highest possible pressures without breaking the anvils, they were made of the hardest known material: a single crystal diamond. The first prototypes were limited in their pressure range and there was not a reliable way to calibrate the pressure.

The diamond anvil cell became the most versatile pressure generating device that has a single characteristic that sets it apart from the other pressure devices – its optical transparency. This provided the early high pressure pioneers with the ability to directly observe the properties of a material while under pressure. With just the use of an optical microscope, phase boundaries, color changes and recrystallization could be seen immediately, while x-ray diffraction or spectroscopy required time to expose and develop photographic film. The potential for the diamond anvil cell was realized by Alvin Van Valkenburg while he was preparing a sample for IR spectroscopy and was checking the alignment of the diamond faces.

The diamond cell was created at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) by Charles E. Weir, Ellis R. Lippincott, and Elmer N. Bunting. Within the group, each member focused on different applications of the diamond cell. Van Valkenburg focused on making visual observations, Weir on XRD, Lippincott on IR Spectroscopy. The group members were well experienced in each of their techniques before they began outside collaboration with university researchers such as William A. Bassett and Taro Takahashi at the University of Rochester.

During the first experiments using diamond anvils, the sample was placed on the flat tip of the diamond (the culet) and pressed between the diamond faces. As the diamond faces were pushed closer together, the sample would be pressed and extrude out from the center. Using a microscope to view the sample, it could be seen that a smooth pressure gradient existed across the sample with the outermost portions of the sample acting as a kind of gasket. The sample was not evenly distributed across the diamond culet but localized in the center due to the &quot;cupping&quot; of the diamond at higher pressures. This cupping phenomenon is the elastic stretching of the edges of the diamond culet, commonly referred to as the &quot;shoulder height&quot;. Many diamonds were broken during the first stages of producing a new cell or any time an experiment is pushed to higher pressure. The NBS group was in a unique position where almost endless supplies of diamonds were available to them. Customs officials occasionally confiscated diamonds from people attempting to smuggle them into the country. Disposing of such valuable confiscated materials could be problematic given rules and regulations. One solution was simply to make such materials available to people at other government agencies if they could make a convincing case for their use. This became an unrivaled resource as other teams at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and General Electric entered the high pressure field.

During the following decades DACs have been successively refined, the most important innovations being the use of gaskets and the ruby pressure calibration. The DAC evolved to be the most powerful lab device for generating static high pressure. The range of static pressure attainable today extends to 640 GPa, much higher than the estimated pressures at the Earth&#x27;s center (~360 GPa).

==Components==
There are many different DAC designs but all have four main components:

===Force-generating device===
Relies on the operation of either a lever arm, tightening screws, or pneumatic or hydraulic pressure applied to a membrane. In all cases the force is uniaxial and is applied to the tables (bases) of the two anvils.

===Two opposing diamond anvils===
Made of high gem quality, flawless diamonds, usually with 16 facets, they typically weigh to  carat (25 to 70 mg). The culet (tip) is ground and polished to a hexadecagonal surface parallel to the table. The culets of the two diamonds face one another, and must be perfectly parallel in order to produce uniform pressure and to prevent dangerous strains. Specially selected anvils are required for specific measurements – for example, low diamond absorption and luminescence is required in corresponding experiments.

===Gasket===
A gasket used in a diamond anvil cell experiment is a thin metal foil, typically 0.3 mm in thickness, which is placed in between the diamonds. Desirable materials for gaskets are strong, stiff metals such as rhenium or tungsten. Steel is frequently used as a cheaper alternative for low pressure experiments. The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the x-ray beam must pass through the gasket. Since they are not transparent to X-rays, if X-ray illumination through the gasket is required, lighter materials such as beryllium, boron nitride, boron or diamond are used as a gasket. Gaskets are preindented by the diamonds and a hole is drilled in the center of the indentation to create the sample chamber.

===Pressure-transmitting medium===
The pressure transmitting medium is the compressible fluid that fills the sample chamber and transmits the applied force to the sample. Hydrostatic pressure is preferred for high-pressure experiments because variation in strain throughout the sample can lead to distorted observations of different behaviors. In some experiments stress and strain relationships are investigated and the effects of non-hydrostatic forces are desired. A good pressure medium will remain a soft, compressible fluid to high pressure.
The full range of techniques that are available has been summarized in a tree diagram by William Bassett. The ability to utilize any and all of these techniques hinges on being able to look through the diamonds which was first demonstrated by visual observations.

==Measuring pressure==
The two main pressure scales used in static high-pressure experiments are X-ray diffraction of a material with a known equation of state and measuring the shift in ruby fluorescence lines. The first began with NaCl, for which the compressibility has been determined by first principles in 1968. The major pitfall of this method of measuring pressure is that the use of X-rays is required. Many experiments do not require X-rays and this presents a major inconvenience to conduct both the intended experiment and a diffraction experiment. In 1971, the NBS high pressure group was set in pursuit of a spectroscopic method for determining pressure. It was found that the wavelength of ruby fluorescence emissions change with pressure; this was easily calibrated against the NaCl scale.

Once pressure could be generated and measured it quickly became a competition for which cells can go the highest. The need for a reliable pressure scale became more important during this race. Shock-wave data for the compressibilities of Cu, Mo, Pd, and Ag were available at this time and could be used to define equations of states up to Mbar pressure. Using these scales these pressures were reported:
Both methods are continually refined and in use today. However, the ruby method is less reliable at high temperature. Well defined equations of state are needed when adjusting temperature and pressure, two parameters that affect the lattice parameters of materials.

==Uses==

Prior to the invention of the diamond anvil cell, static high-pressure apparatus required large hydraulic presses which weighed several tons and required large specialized laboratories. The simplicity and compactness of the DAC meant that it could be accommodated in a wide variety of experiments. Some contemporary DACs can easily fit into a cryostat for low-temperature measurements, and for use with a superconducting electromagnet. In addition to being hard, diamonds have the advantage of being transparent to a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to gamma rays, with the exception of the far ultraviolet and soft X-rays. This makes the DAC a perfect device for spectroscopic experiments and for crystallographic studies using hard X-rays.

A variant of the diamond anvil, the hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) is used in experimental petrology/geochemistry for the study of aqueous fluids, silicate melts, immiscible liquids, mineral solubility and aqueous fluid speciation at geologic pressures and temperatures. The HDAC is sometimes used to examine aqueous complexes in solution using the synchrotron light source techniques XANES and EXAFS. The design of HDAC is very similar to that of DAC, but it is optimized for studying liquids.

==Innovative uses==
An innovative use of the diamond anvil cell is testing the sustainability and durability of life under high pressures, including the search for life on extrasolar planets. Testing portions of the theory of panspermia (a form of interstellar travel) is one application of DAC. When interstellar objects containing life-forms impact a planetary body, there is high pressure upon impact and the DAC can replicate this pressure to determine if the organisms could survive. Another reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is that planetary bodies that hold the potential for life may have incredibly high pressure on their surface.

In 2002, scientists at the Carnegie Institution of Washington examined the pressure limits of life processes. Suspensions of bacteria, specifically &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Shewanella oneidensis&quot;, were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 GPa, which is more than 16,000 times Earth&#x27;s surface pressure (985 hPa). After 30 hours, only about 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction. The bacteria were also able to cling to the surface of the DAC with their tails.

Skeptics debated whether breaking down formate is enough to consider the bacteria living. Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, believes an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Subsequent results from independent research groups have shown the validity of the 2002 work. This is a significant step that reiterates the need for a new approach to the old problem of studying environmental extremes through experiments. There is practically no debate whether microbial life can survive pressures up to 600 MPa, which has been shown over the last decade or so to be valid through a number of scattered publications.

Similar tests were performed with a low-pressure (0.1–600 MPa) diamond anvil cell, which has better imaging quality and signal collection. The studied microbes, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (baker&#x27;s yeast), continued to grow at pressures of 15–50 MPa, and died at 200 MPa.

===Single crystal X-ray diffraction===
Good single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments in diamond anvil cells require sample stage to rotate on the vertical axis, omega. Most diamond anvil cells do not feature a large opening that would allow the cell to be rotated to high angles, a 60 degrees opening is considered sufficient for most crystals but larger angles are possible. The first cell to be used for single crystal experiments was designed by a graduate student at the University of Rochester, Leo Merrill. The cell was triangular with beryllium seats that the diamonds were mounted on; the cell was pressurized with screws and guide pins holding everything in place.

==High-temperature techniques==
Heating in diamond-anvil cells is typically done by two means, external or internal heating. External heating is defined as heating the anvils and would include a number of resistive heaters that are placed around the diamonds or around the cell body. The complementary method does not change the temperature of the anvils and includes fine resistive heaters placed within the sample chamber and laser heating. The main advantage to resistive heating is the precise measurement of temperature with thermocouples, but the temperature range is limited by the properties of the diamond which will oxidize in air at 700 °C The use of an inert atmosphere can extend this range above 1000 °C. A tungsten ring-wire resistive heater inside a BX90 DAC filled with Ar gas was reported to reach 1400 °C. With laser heating the sample can reach temperature above 5000 °C, but the minimum temperature that can be measured when using a laser-heating system is ~1200 °C and the measurement is much less precise. Advances in resistive heating are closing the gap between the two techniques so that systems can be studied from room temperature to beyond 5700 °C with the combination of the two.
===Laser heating===

The development of laser heating began only 8 years after Charles Weir, of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), made the first diamond anvil cell and Alvin Van Valkenburg, NBS, realized the potential of being able to see the sample while under pressure. William Bassett and his colleague Taro Takahashi focused a laser beam on the sample while under pressure. The first laser heating system used a single 7 joule pulsed ruby laser that heated the sample to 3000 °C while at 260 kilobars. This was sufficient to convert graphite to diamond. The major flaws within the first system related to control and temperature measurement.

Temperature measurement was initially done by Basset using an optical pyrometer to measure the intensity of the incandescent light from the sample. Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the black-body radiation and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large thermal gradients in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not. The solution to this problem is ongoing but advances have been made with the introduction of a double-sided approach.

====Double-sided heating====
The use of two lasers to heat the sample reduces the axial temperature gradient, which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly. In order for a double-sided heating system to be successful it is essential that the two lasers are aligned so that they are both focused on the sample position. For in situ heating in diffraction experiments, the lasers need to be focused to the same point in space where the X-ray beam is focused.

====Laser heating systems at synchrotron facilities====
The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) as well as many other synchrotron facilities as the three major synchrotron user facilities in the United States all have beamlines equipped with laser heating systems. The respective beamlines with laser heating systems are at the ESRF ID27, ID18, and ID24; at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), 13-ID-D GSECARS and 16-ID-B HP-CAT; at the National Synchrotron Light Source, X17B3; and at the Advanced Light Source, 12.2.2. Laser heating has become a routine technique in high-pressure science but the reliability of temperature measurement is still controversial.

====Temperature measurement====
In the first experiments with laser heating, temperature came from a calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures in the range of 1000 °C to 1600 °C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30 °C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50 °C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200 °C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett&#x27;s group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black-body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.

==Gas loading==

===Principle===
The pressure transmitting medium is an important component in any high-pressure experiment. The medium fills the space within the sample &#x27;chamber&#x27; and applies the pressure being transmitted to the medium onto the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the medium should maintain a homogeneous distribution of pressure on the sample. In other words, the medium must stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting medium has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The medium must also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the medium should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the medium should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the medium should be a poor x-ray scatterer – as to not contribute to the signal.

Some of the most commonly used pressure transmitting media have been sodium chloride, silicone oil, and a 4:1 methanol-ethanol mixture. Sodium chloride is easy to load and is used for high-temperature experiments because it acts as a good thermal insulator. The methanol-ethanol mixture displays good hydrostaticity to about 10 GPa and with the addition of a small amount of water can be extended to about 15 GPa.

For pressure experiments that exceed 10 GPa, noble gases are preferred. The extended hydrostaticity greatly reduces the pressure gradient in samples at high pressure. Noble gases, such as helium, neon, and argon are optically transparent, thermally insulating, have small X-ray scattering factors, and have good hydrostaticity at high pressures. Even after solidification, noble gases provide quasihydrostatic environments.

Argon is used for experiments involving laser heating because it is chemically insulating. Since it condenses at a temperature above that of liquid nitrogen, it can be loaded cryogenically. Helium and neon have low X-ray scattering factors and are thus used for collecting X-ray diffraction data. Helium and neon also have low shear moduli; minimizing strain on the sample. These two noble gases do not condense above that of liquid nitrogen and cannot be loaded cryogenically. Instead, a high-pressure gas loading system has been developed that employs a gas compression method.

===Techniques===
In order to load a gas as a sample or pressure transmitting medium, the gas must be in a dense state, as to not shrink the sample chamber once pressure is induced. To achieve a dense state, gases can be liquefied at low temperatures or compressed. Cryogenic loading is a technique that uses liquefied gas as a means of filling the sample chamber. The DAC is directly immersed into the cryogenic fluid that fills the sample chamber. However, there are disadvantages to cryogenic loading. With the low temperatures indicative of cryogenic loading, the sample is subjected to temperatures that could irreversibly change it. Also, the boiling liquid could displace the sample or trap an air bubble in the chamber. It is not possible to load gas mixtures using the cryogenic method due to the different boiling points of most gases. Gas compression technique densifies the gases at room temperature. With this method, most of the problems seen with cryogenic loading are fixed. Also, loading gas mixtures becomes a possibility. The technique uses a vessel or chamber in which the DAC is placed and is filled with gas. Gases are pressurized and pumped into the vessel with a compressor. Once the vessel is filled and the desired pressure is reached the DAC is closed with a clamp system run by motor driven screws.

===Components===
* High-pressure vessel: Vessel in which the diamond anvil cell is loaded.
* Clamp device seals the DAC; which is tightened by closure mechanism with motor driven screws.
* PLC (programmable logic controller): Controls air flow to the compressor and all valves. The PLC ensures that valves are opened and closed in the correct sequence for accurate loading and safety.
* Compressor: Responsible for compression of the gas. The compressor employs a dual-stage air-driven diaphragm design that creates pressure and avoids contamination. Able to achieve 207 MPa of pressure.
* Valves: Valves open and close via the PLC to regulate which gases enter the high-pressure vessel.
* Burst disks: Two burst disks in the system – one for the high-pressure system and one for the low-pressure system. These disks act as a pressure relief system that protects the system from over-pressurization
* Pressure transducers: A pressure sensor for the low- and high-pressure systems. Produces a 0–5 V output over their pressure range.
* Pressure meters: Digital displays connected to each pressure transducer and the PLC system.
* Vacuum pump and gauges: Cleans the system (by evacuation) before loading.
* Optical system: Used visual observation; allowing in situ observations of gasket deformation.
* Ruby fluorescence system: Pressure in the sample chamber can be measured during loading using an online ruby fluorescence system. Not all systems have an online ruby fluorescence system for in situ measuring. However, being able to monitor the pressure within the chamber while the DAC is being sealed is advantageous – ensuring the desired pressure is reached (or not over-shot). Pressure is measured by the shift in the laser induced luminescence of rubies in the sample chamber.

<doc id="774228" wikidata="Q357353" url="?curid=774228" title="Herschel V. Johnson">
<text>Herschel Vespasian Johnson (September 18, 1812August 16, 1880) was an American politician. He was the 41st Governor of Georgia from 1853 to 1857 and the vice presidential nominee of the Douglas wing of the Democratic Party in the 1860 U.S. presidential election. He also served as one of Georgia&#x27;s Confederate States senators.

==Early life==
Johnson was born near Farmer&#x27;s Bridge in Burke County, Georgia. In 1834, he graduated from the University of Georgia. He studied at the private law school of Judge William T. Gould in Augusta, Georgia and was admitted to the bar.

He moved to Jefferson County in 1839 and began to practice law in Louisville, Georgia. In 1844, Johnson moved to the state capitol, Milledgeville, where he continued to practice law. During the 1850s, he would acquire the Samuel Rockwell House, a historic house in the city, as his summer house.

==Political life==

He unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1843. In 1844 he was a presidential elector, and cast his ballot for James K. Polk and George M. Dallas. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1847, and lost the Democratic nomination to George W. Towns; Towns won the general election, and in 1848 he appointed Johnson to the United States Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Walter T. Colquitt. Johnson served from February 4, 1848, to March 3, 1849, but was not a candidate for election to the seat. He returned to Georgia and served as a circuit court judge from 1849 to 1853. In 1853, he was elected Governor of Georgia, then re-elected in 1855. During the 1856 presidential campaign, Johnson declared that a Fremont victory would be grounds for secession. After he finished his term as governor in 1857, Johnson County, Georgia was named in his honor. In 1860, when the Democratic Party refused to add the support of extending slavery to the western territories to its platform, the party split. To try to recapture some southern votes, Johnson was chosen as the northern Democrats&#x27; nominee as the running mate of presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas.

Johnson was a presidential elector in 1852.

He was also a slave owner. In 1840, he owned 34 slaves in Jefferson County, Georgia. In 1850, he owned 7 slaves in Milledgeville, Georgia. He also owned 60 additional slaves in Jefferson County, Georgia. In 1860, he owned 115 slaves in Jefferson County, Georgia.

==Civil War==
In 1861 he served as a delegate to the state secession convention, and opposed secession from the Union. When it became clear that Georgia would secede, however, he acquiesced out of loyalty to his state and served as a senator of the Second Confederate Congress from 1862 to the end of the war in 1865. In the Confederate Senate, he opposed conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus. After the Civil War, Johnson was a leader in the Reconstruction. Upon Georgia&#x27;s readmission to the Union in 1866, he was chosen as a U.S. Senator, but was disallowed from serving due to his allegiance to the Confederate States of America. He again became a circuit court judge in 1873 and served until his death in 1880 in Louisville, Georgia.

Johnson served as president of Georgia&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1865.

<text>John Neely Johnson (August 2, 1825 – August 31, 1872) was an American lawyer and politician. He was elected as the fourth governor of California from 1856 to 1858, and later appointed justice to the Nevada Supreme Court from 1867 to 1871. As a member of the American Party, Johnson remains one of only two members of a third party to be elected to the California governorship (the other was Hiram Johnson of the Progressive Party).

==Biography==
Born in rural Gibson County, Indiana, Johnson never attended college; while born to a prominent family, his plans for his studies were foiled by economic effects of the Panic of 1837. He apprenticed a printer before moving to Iowa to work with a lawyer, and was admitted to practice law in Iowa.

In July 1849, Johnson left Iowa for the Gold Rush in California, where he briefly employed himself as a gold prospector, and later as a mule train driver. Johnson restarted his law career in Sacramento, California by founding a law practice with Ferris Forman, and was elected as Sacramento City Attorney in 1850. After two years in the City Attorney&#x27;s office, Johnson began his political career by running as a Whig in the 1852 election, in which Johnson was elected to the California State Assembly as one of four members representing Sacramento.

During his time in the Assembly, Johnson nearly broke a local editor&#x27;s nose after accusing the editor of writing an insulting article about him. The editor aimed a pistol at Johnson, but was tackled by onlookers before he could fire.

In 1854, both the state and federal wings of the Whig Party were on the verge on collapse due to party splits over the Kansas–Nebraska Act. In the wake of this split, Johnson joined the nativist American Party, known popularly as the Know Nothings.

In the 1855 general election, the American Party hoped to capitalize on the disintegration of the Whig party, internal Democratic divisions, and growing anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment. The party nominated Assemblyman Johnson as its candidate for governor. Johnson ran against incumbent John Bigler, with Johnson securing the governorship by a comfortable margin. Johnson was described as &quot;the most startled man in the state&quot; upon hearing of his election.

Along with the governorship, Know Nothings also received considerable gains in the California State Legislature, as well as elections to every other major executive post in the state, including the offices of Lieutenant Governor (Robert M. Anderson), Attorney General (William T. Wallace), Treasurer (Henry Bates), and Controller (George W. Whitman).

==Governor==
Johnson was sworn in as the fourth governor of California on January 9, 1856. At 30, Johnson is the youngest governor in California history. Johnson inherited a growing state debt from the Bigler administration, and planned to reduce government expenditures to cut the debt. Early in his administration, Johnson agreed with legislation authored by San Francisco Assemblyman Horace Hawes to unite the city and county of San Francisco as a single entity to combat widespread corruption and lawlessness. The result of the legislation passed by Johnson was the Consolidation Act of 1856,&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=cg0KAAAAIAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=AmxCAAAAYAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which unified the municipal and county governments, as well as separated the southern portion of San Francisco to later become San Mateo County.

===The Vigilante Committee===
Since the early 1850s, tensions within San Francisco political circles had sometimes erupted in open violence. In 1851, armed citizens formed the San Francisco Vigilance Movement to correct wrongs they saw being committed or protected by the municipal government. The vigilantes lynched two criminals being held in city jails. Governor John McDougall, condemned the actions of the vigilantes, but was not able to stop them because state law enforcement was too weak.

Distrust of city authorities again reached the surface on May 14, 1856, when James King of William, editor of the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot; and a vocal critic of corrupt officials, was mortally wounded by James P. Casey, a purported ballot-box stuffer and city politician. When Casey was in the custody of San Francisco law enforcement, William Tell Coleman, a ringleader in the 1851 Vigilance Committee and another vocal critic of municipal authorities, called for the formation of another Vigilante Committee. Vigilantes erected a barricade along Sacramento Street to repel city officers from removing them. After a week, the Vigilantes marched on the city jail and overpowered its guards to arrest Casey, along with another criminal: Charles Cora, who had fatally shot a U.S. Marshal the previous year.

Johnson traveled to San Francisco from Sacramento along with his brother William and the newly commissioned chief of the California Militia, Captain William Tecumseh Sherman to meet the Vigilante Committee ringleaders. Sherman recalled in his 1875 &quot;Memoirs&quot; Johnson angrily confronting Coleman and other Vigilante ringleaders in their makeshift headquarters and exclaiming, &quot;Coleman, what the devil is the matter here?&quot; Coleman replied that the San Franciscans &quot;were tired of it, and had no faith in the officers of the law.&quot; After personal negotiations between Governor Johnson and the Vigilantes over transferring the criminals to state law enforcement failed, Johnson watched helplessly as both Casey and Cora were hanged by the Vigilantes on May 20.

Johnson returned to Sacramento with the Vigilantes refusing to disperse, claiming they were San Francisco&#x27;s rightful law enforcement. With the city&#x27;s police and sheriff&#x27;s departments outnumbered and trying to establish an armed presence in the streets, Mayor James Van Ness pleaded to Johnson for military assistance. Johnson responded by instructing Sherman to call the California Militia to San Francisco on June 2, and issued a gubernatorial proclamation declaring San Francisco in a state of insurrection the following day. Johnson&#x27;s proclamation, like McDougall&#x27;s, was difficult to enforce. Johnson had instructed the California Militia to impose martial law, but without proper arms, the Militia needed more equipment to be provided by federal forces. Johnson ordered John E. Wool of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Department of the Pacific based in Benicia to dispatch weapons to the state militia. General Wool declined, claiming that the Governor did not have the authority to use arms from federal soldiers because that right laid exclusively with the President. Both Johnson and Sherman were furious about General Wool&#x27;s refusal to lend arms for state militia forces: Sherman resigned from his military commission, vowing never to return to California politics. Meanwhile, the California Militia, under the command of Major General Volney E. Howard continued to gather arms, but suffered a major setback on June 21, 1856, when Vigilantes seized the arms schooner &quot;Julia&quot;.

The Vigilantes remained San Francisco&#x27;s de facto law enforcement until August 1856. Vigilantes arrested Chief Justice David S. Terry of the Supreme Court of California for stabbing a Vigilante member, and hanged two more individuals. Governor Johnson revoked his proclamation on San Francisco&#x27;s insurrection on November 3.

===Rest of term===
The Vigilante Crisis in the summer of 1856 overshadowed the rest of Johnson&#x27;s term. Despite the fact that a large portion of the State Legislature were Know Nothing party members, Johnson vetoed a bill due to its &quot;bad spelling, improper punctuation and erasures.&quot; Johnson also approved funds to build the future California State Capitol. By 1857, Know Nothings were frustrated with Johnson&#x27;s inability to deal with the San Francisco Vigilantes. During that year&#x27;s American Party convention, Johnson lost the party&#x27;s nomination for the governorship to George W. Bowie. Bowie would be defeated by Lecompton Democrat John Weller. Shortly after, the American Party ceased to be a major political force in California and elsewhere throughout the United States, and were absorbed by the Republican Party and sections of the Democratic Party.

==Nevada==

Frustrated by his tenure in the California governorship and anxious for a new political start, Johnson relocated to western Utah Territory, which became Nevada Territory in March 1861. In 1863, Johnson was elected as a delegate to Nevada&#x27;s first Constitutional Convention. Following its failed ratification vote, a second Constitutional Convention was called and he again became a delegate to, and this time was elected President of the Convention. Nevada&#x27;s electorate ratified this second attempt, and Nevada was admitted as a U.S. state on October 31, 1864.

In 1867, Nevada governor Henry G. Blasdel appointed Johnson to the Nevada Supreme Court. He served until 1871. After leaving the high court, Johnson contracted a severe case of sunstroke and died in Salt Lake City on August 31, 1872.

<doc id="774258" wikidata="Q691229" url="?curid=774258" title="Joseph Johnson (Virginia politician)">
<text>Joseph Ellis Johnson (December 19, 1785 – February 27, 1877) was a farmer, businessman, and politician who served as United States Representative and became the 32nd Governor of Virginia from 1852 to 1856, the first Virginia governor to be popularly elected as well as the only Virginia governor from west of the Appalachian mountains. During the American Civil War, he sympathized with the Confederacy, but returned to what had become West Virginia for his final years.

==Early life and family==
Born in Orange County, New York, Johnson moved with his widowed mother Abigail Wright Johnson and four siblings to Belvidere, New Jersey in 1791, and then to Winchester, Virginia (possibly after a long detour to Suffolk in southeast Virginia). In 1801, the family moved further west across the Appalachian Mountains to Bridgeport in what became Harrison County, Virginia (and West Virginia late in his lifetime, as discussed below).

The sixteen-year-old Johnson soon got a job helping Ephraim Smith, a local gentleman farmer suffering from ill health, and managed Smith&#x27;s land. Three years later, on May 14, 1804, he married one of his employer&#x27;s daughters, Sarah Smith (1784–1853). At least five of their children died before the age of 11. However, their son Dr. Benjamin Franklin Johnson (1816–1855) and daughter Catherine Selina Minor (1824–1900) survived and married, although both moved from the area (to Franklin County, Ohio, and Baltimore, respectively).

==Career==

By 1807, in addition to farming, Johnson rebuilt the Smith mill (built circa 1803) on Simpson Creek, which he bought from Smith&#x27;s widow and heirs. In 1811, the Harrison county government ordered a bridge built about a quarter mile above &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Mill&quot;, which became the first bridge built in Harrison county outside Clarksburg. As discussed below, Johnson would incorporate Bridgeport on his land, as well as build a mansion, which survives today as the Governor Joseph Johnson House, although both his son and daughter moved to states which remained in the Union.

Unlike many Virginians living across the Appalachian mountains, Johnson came to own enslaved people. While Johnson did not own slaves according to the 1820 federal census, in both the 1830 and 1840 federal census, Johnson owned three enslaved males and three enslaved females (two of each were children in 1830 but by 1840 all were 10 years old or older). In the 1850 federal census, the first with separate slave schedules, Johnson owned two mulatto men (aged 50 and 22), as well as a 15 year old Black boy, and three Black women (aged 48, 25 and 23 years old). A decade later, in the last federal slave census, Johnson owned 11 enslaved people (mulatto men aged 65, 35 and 29 years old, mulatto women aged 60, 33 and 31, a 15 year old Black boy, and mulatto boys aged 8, 6, 3 and year old).
===Constable to Captain===
Johnson initially became active in local politics as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party (aligned with President Thomas Jefferson). He became the local constable in 1811 and formed one of two or three companies of &quot;Harrison riflemen&quot; that fought the War of 1812. In 1814, Captain Johnson and Captain John McWhorter of the other company led their riflemen to Norfolk, where Johnson and his men helped keep the peace until the war&#x27;s end in 1815, while McWhorter&#x27;s men headed west under General (and future President) William H. Harrison to fight in Ohio. Johnson&#x27;s men were first assigned to the Sixth Regiment of Virginia militia, then to the Fourth Regiment.

===Delegate to Congressman and constitutional convention delegate===

When Johnson returned to Harrison County, voters elected him to represent them in the Virginia House of Delegates, rejecting incumbent John Prunty, who had represented them for 22 years. One of Johnson&#x27;s first acts was introducing legislation organizing Bridgeport as a town (on 15 acres of his land). That act passed on January 15, 1816; Johnson became one of the town&#x27;s seven original trustees. Voters reelected Johnson to the House of Delegates in 1816 and with a year&#x27;s gap, elected and reelected him again in 1818-1822, after which Johnson decided not to run again. Johnson would build a mansion in Bridgeport, the Governor Joseph Johnson House.

At the urging of Judge John G. Jackson, Johnson ran against prominent orator and Congressman Philip Doddridge, Johnson again upset the incumbent. He served in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Congresses (March 4, 1823 – March 3, 1825, and became chair of the Committee on Expenditures on Public Buildings in the Nineteenth Congress. Johnson lost his reelection campaign in 1826 to Doddridge and so did not serve in the Twentieth nor Twenty-first Congress, but when Doddridge died, voters elected Johnson to the Twenty-second Congress to fill the brief vacancy, so Johnson again served from January 21 to March 3, 1833. Johnson did not run for renomination in 1832. During this period, Congress built and maintained the National Road westward from Cumberland, Maryland; Johnson sat on the Cumberland Road committee. A key question became where the road would cross the Ohio River. Although Wheeling became the crossing point, others had advocated Parkersburg as the crossing point, following what would later become the Northwestern Turnpike (now U.S. Route 50) through Romney and Clarksburg to Parkersburg. Part of the compromise that allowed the Wheeling route was the construction of a road between Wheeling and Romney.

Johnson again ran for Congress as a Jacksonian in 1834, won the seat in the Twenty-fourth Congress, and was reelected (as a Democrat) to the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Congresses (March 4, 1835 – March 3, 1841). Johnson became chair of the Committee on Accounts in the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Congresses. He declined to run for renomination in 1840 but was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1844. Johnson was elected to the Twenty-ninth Congress (March 4, 1845 - March 3, 1847) and became chair of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (Twenty-ninth Congress). He again declined to run for renomination in 1846.

In 1847, Johnson again ran for election to the Virginia House of Delegates and was reelected the following year, again serving part-time while pursuing his farming and other business interests. During the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 and 1851, Johnson was one of the four delegates from the west-of-the-Appalachians district consisting of Wood, Ritchie, Harrison, Doddridge, Tyler, and Wetzel Counties, alongside John F. Snodgrass, Gideon D. Camden and Peter G. Van Winkle. As the convention&#x27;s eldest delegate, Johnson called the convention to order and chaired the suffrage committee, where he fought for his region&#x27;s interests, especially universal adult white male suffrage and against a poll tax.
===Governor of Virginia===

The General Assembly elected Johnson Governor of Virginia in 1851, shortly before the new state constitution made the office elective by voters. Johnson thus served a short initial term. He also became the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in September 1851, then won reelection by defeating the Whig candidate (also from west of the Appalachians), George W. Summers, in part because Summers supported the American Colonization Society and thus was considered too &quot;light-handed on the issue of slavery&quot;.

The only Virginia governor from west of the Allegheny Mountains began his gubernatorial duties under the new constitution on January 1, 1852. He served four years before returning to his Bridgeport home, although his wife died and was buried in Bridgeport during his governorship. As governor (and prohibited by the constitution from succeeding himself), Johnson granted clemency (sale out of state) to three enslaved people convicted for murders in and near Richmond in highly publicized cases. Phillis had been convicted of murdering a crying child under her care by administering morphine; Jordan Hatcher had killed a white overseer in a Richmond tobacco factory who was whipping him; young Lucy had attempted to conceal a pregnancy and ingested laudanum and camphor while giving birth in an outbuilding and the infant&#x27;s corpse was later found.

==American Civil War==
Johnson had been a Democratic presidential elector in 1860 and personally disfavored secession. However, during Virginia&#x27;s secession crisis in 1861, Johnson joined in the Confederate States&#x27; declared secession, and became an elector for Jefferson Davis as the Confederate President. Pro-Union men held a mass meeting in Clarksburg on April 22, 1861, to hear an address by John S. Carlile, and another on May 3, 1861, to hear an address by Francis H. Pierpont. However, Johnson countered by chairing another meeting on April 26 of &quot;Southern Rights&quot; men, including W.P. Cooper, Norval Lewis, and W. F. Gordon.

When U.S. Army soldiers occupied Bridgeport, Johnson moved his household eastward across the Appalachians to Staunton, where he remained for the rest of the war, during which the State of West Virginia was created, in part through Carlile&#x27;s and Pierpont&#x27;s efforts. His nephew, Waldo P. Johnson, who had become a lawyer in Harrison County before moving to Missouri in 1842 (where he served in that state&#x27;s legislature and then became a U.S. Senator and member of the Peace convention of 1861), was expelled from the U.S. Senate on January 10, 1862, whereupon he became a Confederate Senator from Missouri and (after a time in Canada following the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat), in 1875 chairman of Missouri&#x27;s constitutional convention.

==Final years, death and legacy==

In 1866, Johnson, who had returned to Bridgeport after the conflict, formally joined the Simpson Creek Baptist Church, in whose churchyard his wife had been buried 13 years before. He died at his home, Oakdale, in Bridgeport in 1877 and was buried beside his wife and young children in the old Brick Church Cemetery. In 1887, a decade after Johnson&#x27;s death, West Virginia&#x27;s legislature formally incorporated Bridgeport. In 1941, the cemetery merged with the adjoining Odd Fellows cemetery and Masonic Lodge cemetery and became known as the &quot;Bridgeport Cemetery&quot;. Several locations in Bridgeport, West Virginia honor Johnson, including Johnson Avenue, Johnson Elementary School, and his former home, the Governor Joseph Johnson House.

The Library of Virginia maintains his executive papers.

==Electoral history==

1851; Johnson was elected Governor of Virginia with 53% of the vote, defeating Whig George W. Summers.

<text>Mordecai Wyatt Johnson (January 4, 1890 – September 10, 1976) was an American educator and pastor. He served as the first African-American president of Howard University, from 1926 until 1960. Johnson has been considered one of the three leading African-American preachers of the early 20th-century, along with Vernon Johns and Howard Thurman.

==Early life==

Johnson was born on January 12, 1890, in Paris, Tennessee, to parents who were former slaves. His father was Reverend Wyatt J. Johnson, a preacher and mill worker. His mother, Carolyn Freeman, was a domestic worker for one of the prominent families in town.

==Education==

Johnson attended a small elementary school in his native town. Afterward, he moved to Nashville, where he studied at Roger Williams University. Later he studied at Howe Institute in Memphis.

He transferred to the Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College, a historically black college), where he completed his secondary and undergraduate education. During his college career, he was a member of the debating team and the Glee Club, a star athlete in three sports, and quarterback of the football team. Offered a faculty position at the college upon graduation, he taught English and economics and served a year as acting dean. He maintained a profound interest in economics throughout his career, an interest that was apparent in some of his major speeches.

After one year of teaching, he continued his education at the University of Chicago, where he received a second A.B. degree, and at the Rochester Theological Seminary in Rochester, New York, where he earned the B.D. degree. At Rochester he was profoundly influenced by the great &quot;social gospel&quot; advocate, Walter Rauschenbusch. His experiences there strongly influenced his thinking and his entire career. He also earned a Doctor of Divinity degree at Harvard University in 1923.

==Family==

Johnson married Anna Ethelyn Gardner on December 25, 1916. They had five children: Carolyn Elizabeth Johnson, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson Jr., Archer Clement Johnson, William Howard Johnson, and Anna Faith Johnson.

==Career==

Following a brief stint as secretary of the western region of the Student YMCA, in 1917 he became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charleston, West Virginia. He later founded a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

=== Presidency of Howard University ===

On June 26, 1926, at the age of 36, Johnson was unanimously elected the eleventh President of Howard University, becoming the first African American to serve as the permanent head of that institution. Prior to his appointment Johnson had served as Professor of Economics and History at Morehouse College. He had also served as Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charleston, West Virginia.

During his tenure, Johnson appointed Charles Hamilton Houston as dean of the law school, who played a significant role in dismantling the Jim Crow laws.

Johnson raised millions of dollars for new buildings and for upgrading all of the schools. National honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa, were established on the campus of Howard.

During his administration, it was said that Howard had the greatest collection of African American scholars to be found anywhere. Notable scholars at Howard included:

* Alain LeRoy Locke, graduated from English and Philosophy at Harvard, and was the first African American Rhodes Scholar,
* Ralph Bunche, professor of political science and later a Nobel Laureate;
* Charles R. Drew, who perfected the use of blood plasma; 
* Percy Lavon Julian, a noted chemist; and
* Sterling Allen Brown, professor of English and noted Harlem Renaissance poet;
* Merze Tate, diplomatic scholar and first African American woman to attend the University of Oxford.

Johnson brought Howard University into national prominence and served as president of Howard for 34 years, since 1926 until his retirement in 1960. In this time the enrollment at Howard University increased from 2,000 in 1926 to more than 10,000 in 1960.

===Johnson the Orator===

Johnson was an annual speaker for the Education Night at the National Baptist Convention, a speaker at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston, and spoke alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and others at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. He traveled 25,000 miles a year throughout the country speaking principally on topics such as racism, segregation, and discrimination. In 1951 he was a member of the American delegation to the NATO meetings in London.

==Awards and recognitions==

In 1929, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awarded Johnson the Spingarn Medal (its highest honor at that time), for Johnson&#x27;s ability to secure annual federal funds to support the university&#x27;s financial future.

==Death==

Johnson died on September 10, 1976, at the age of 86, in Washington, D.C.

<text>Malvin Greston Whitfield (October 11, 1924 – November 19, 2015) was an American athlete, goodwill ambassador, and airman. Nicknamed &quot;Marvelous Mal&quot;, he was the Olympic champion in the 800 meters at the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics, and a member of the 1948 gold medal team in the 4 × 400 meters relay. Overall, Whitfield was a five-time Olympic medalist (three gold, one silver, one bronze). After his competitive career, he worked for 47 years as a coach, goodwill ambassador, as well as an athletic mentor in Africa on behalf of the United States Information Service.

==Early life==
Whitfield was born in Bay City, Texas. He moved to the Watts district of Los Angeles when he was 4 years old. At that age, his father died. His mother died when he was 12, after which he was raised by his older sister. He sneaked into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the 1932 Summer Olympic Games, where he watched Eddie Tolan defeat Ralph Metcalfe in the 100 meter race, an event that spurred his own Olympic goals.

Whitfield joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. After World War II, he remained in the military, but also enrolled at Ohio State University. In the early 1950s, he also served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War, flying 27 combat missions as a tail gunner. Under the coaching of Larry Snyder, he won the NCAA title while at Ohio State in the 800 m in 1948 and 880 yd in 1949. After leaving the university, he won the AAU title from 1949 to 1951 at 800 m, in 1953 and 1954 at 880 yd and in 1952 at 400 m. He also won the 800 m at the 1951 Pan American Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

==Olympic career==

At the 1948 Olympics in London, Whitfield won the 800 m and was a member of the winning 4 × 400 m relay team. He also earned a bronze medal in the 400 m. At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, he repeated his 800 m victory. He also earned a silver medal as a member of United States 4 × 400 m relay team. He set a world record at 880 yd of 1:49.2 in 1950 and dropped it to 1:48.6 in 1952. In 1954, Whitfield became the first black athlete to win the James E. Sullivan Award, given annually by the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States (AAU) to the outstanding amateur athlete in the country. Whitfield narrowly missed making the 1956 Olympic team while a student at California State University, Los Angeles, and he retired from track competition shortly thereafter.

==Sports ambassador==
After graduating, he worked for the United States Department of State and the United States Information Service, conducting sports clinics in Africa.

In his 47 years in Africa, Whitfield trained and gave consultation to dozens of athletes who represented their countries as Olympians and All-Africa Games champions. He coached in 20 countries and lived in Kenya, Uganda and Egypt. Whitfield also arranged sports scholarships for over 5,000 African athletes to study in the United States. During his career as a diplomat, he traveled to over 132 countries and played a key role in training and developing African athletes. United States President Ronald Reagan wrote of him: &quot;Whether flying combat missions over Korea, or winning gold medal after gold medal at the Olympics, or serving as an ambassador of goodwill among the young athletes of Africa, you have given your all. This country is proud of you, and grateful to you.&quot; Shortly after his retirement from government service in 1989, Whitfield was invited to the Oval Office, where President George H. W. Bush recognized his service to the nation and the world.

==Awards==
In 1954, Whitfield won the James E. Sullivan Award for amateur athletics. Whitfield was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1974, and Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1978. Among track and field athletes, only Jesse Owens had been inducted before him.

==Memoir==
Whitfield wrote the book &quot;Learning to Run&quot;, which was translated into French. His memoir was published by his foundation and titled &quot;Beyond the Finish Line&quot;.

==Personal life==
He was married to Nola Whitfield. He was also the father of Nyna Konishi, Lonnie Whitfield, CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield and accomplished high jumper Ed Wright. In 1989 Whitfield founded the Mal Whitfield Foundation for the promotion of sports, academics, and culture. The foundation has distributed 5,000 athletic scholarships.

Whitfield died at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospice center in Washington, D.C. on the night of November 19, 2015, aged 91. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="774281" wikidata="Q2339098" url="?curid=774281" title="Tadj ol-Molouk">
<text>Tâdj ol-Molouk (; 17 March 1896 – 10 March 1982) was Queen of Iran as the second wife of Reza Shah, founder of the Pahlavi dynasty and Shah of Iran between 1925 and 1941. The title she was given after becoming queen means &quot;Crown of the Kings&quot; in the Persian language. She was the first queen in Iran after the Muslim conquest in the seventh century to have participated in public royal representation, and she played a major role in the &quot;kashf-e hijab&quot; (ban of the veil) in 1936.

==Biography==
She was the daughter of Brigadier General Teymūr Khan Ayromlou, of the Turkic Ayrum tribe, and wife Malek os-Soltan.

Her marriage with Reza Khan took place in 1916. It was arranged and proved an advantage in the military career of Reza Khan at the time, due to the connections of her father, enabling him to advance in the Cossack hierarchy. Together, they had four children: Shams, Mohammad Reza, the last Shah of Iran, and his twin sister Ashraf, and Ali Reza.

On 23 February 1921, Reza Khan took power in a coup in Tehran.

===Queen===

On 15 December 1925, her spouse declared himself &quot;Shahanshah&quot; (King of Kings), and she was granted the title &quot;Maleke&quot; (Queen).

Privately, Tadj ol-Molouk did not live with Reza Shah at this point, as he reportedly devoted his time to his other wives, Turan Amirsoleimani, and, from 1923, Esmat Dowlatshahi. Neither did she involve herself in politics on her own initiative. However, it was she who was given the position of Queen during his reign, which signified an important role in his policy on women. She was the first Queen of Iran to have played a public role, and to have performed an official position out in public society.

Her role as a queen participating in public representational duties had a great importance within the new policy of women&#x27;s role in Iran, as it was the policy of her husband to increase women&#x27;s participation in society as a method of modernization, in accordance with the example of Turkey.

In 1928, the queen attended the Fatima Masumeh Shrine during her pilgrimage in Qom wearing a veil which did not cover her completely as well as showing her face, for which she was harshly criticised by a cleric. As a response, Reza Shah publicly beat the cleric who had criticised the queen the next day. The reform to allow female teachers and students not to veil, as well as allowing female students to study alongside men, were all reforms opposed and criticised by the Shia clergy. 

During the reign of her husband she played an important role in the abolition of the veil in Iran: the Kashf-e hijab. The unveiling of women had a huge symbolic importance to achieve women&#x27;s participation in society, and the shah introduced the reform gradually so as not to cause unrest: while women teachers were encouraged to unveil in 1933 and schoolgirls and female students in 1935, the official declaration of unveiling were made on 8 January 1936, and the queen and her daughters were given an important role in this event. That day, Reza Shah attended the graduation ceremony of the Tehran Teacher&#x27;s College with the queen and their two daughters unveiled and dressed in modern clothes, without veils. The queen handed out diplomas, while the shah spoke about half the population being disregarded, and told women that the future was now in their hands. This was the first time an Iranian queen showed herself in public. Afterwards, the Shah had pictures of his wife and daughters published, and unveiling enforced throughout Iran.

Tadj ol-Molouk continued to participate in public representation in this fashion when obliged to by her husband and thus played an indirect role in his policy, but she never made any initiatives of her own and stayed out of political involvement. In 1939, she attended the wedding of her son to Fawzia of Egypt. The relationship to Fawzia was not, however, described as a good one.

===Later life===
On 16 September 1941, Reza Shah was deposed and exiled. She did not follow him to his exile in Mauritius, and later South Africa, instead choosing to remain at the court of her son in Iran. A year after Reza Shah&#x27;s death, she married Gholamhossein Saheb Divani, the son of a prominent family from Shiraz who was her junior. He was later elected to the National Consultative Assembly.

She held significant influence over her son and reportedly dominated the royal household. The conflict between Tadj ol-Molouk and her daughter-in-law Queen Fawzia attracted attention at the time, and reportedly participated in the factors which lead to the departure of Fawzia to Egypt and the dissolution of the royal marriage in 1948. She was acknowledged to have had a deeply devoted relationship to Princess Shahnaz.

In 1950, Tadj ol-Molouk participated in arranging the marriage between her son the Shah and Soraya Esfandiari-Bakhtiari. She left Iran with most of the royal household during the premiership of Mossadegh when the latter asked the Shah to expel them from Iran. They returned to Iran after the fall of Mossadegh in 1953.
During her son&#x27;s reign, Tadj ol-Molouk did not normally participate in royal representation, in contrast to her daughters and daughter-in-law, nor did she participate much in charity. She did not fully attend the coronation of the shah on 26 October 1967, attending only the reception following it rather than the coronation itself. She did arrange two receptions in her palace annually: one to celebrate the birthday of her eldest grandson, and one to celebrate the fall of Mossadegh. When the health of the shah was beginning to deteriorate in 1971, this was not admitted, and the official reason for physicians to visit the palace was for the sake of the elderly Tadj ol-Molouk.

Before the 1979 revolution, Tadj ol-Molouk was sent by Mohammad Reza Shah to Princess Shams Pahlavi&#x27;s house in Beverly Hills. She arrived in Los Angeles on 30 December 1978 aboard an Imperial Iranian Air Force Boeing 747. Soon after her arrival, on 2 January 1979, Iranian students in the city attacked the house and attempted to burn it. Then she and her daughter took refuge at the Sunnylands estate in Palm Springs owned by Walter Annenberg, former US ambassador to the United Kingdom.

She died in Acapulco, Mexico, on 10 March 1982, seven days before her 86th birthday.

<text>Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation is an Indian-American multinational IT consulting and outsourcing company. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Cognizant is part of the NASDAQ-100 and trades under CTSH. It was founded in Chennai, India, as an in-house technology unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 1994, and started serving external clients in 1996. After a series of corporate reorganizations, there was an initial public offering in 1998. Ravi Kumar Singisetti has been the CEO of the company since January 2023, replacing Brian Humphries.

== History ==
Cognizant was established in 1994 in Chennai, India, as Dun &amp; Bradstreet Satyam Software (DBSS), a 76:24 joint venture between Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Satyam Computers, with Kumar Mahadeva, and Srini Raju as the founding CEOs and MDs. It began with 50 employees in Chennai as Dun &amp; Bradstreet&#x27;s in-house technology unit focused on implementing large-scale IT projects for Dun &amp; Bradstreet businesses. In 1996, the company started pursuing customers beyond Dun &amp; Bradstreet.

In 1996, Dun &amp; Bradstreet spun off several of its subsidiaries, including Erisco, IMS International, Nielsen Media Research, Pilot Software, Strategic Technologies and DBSS, to form a new company called Cognizant Corporation, headquartered in Chennai, India. Three months later, in 1997, DBSS renamed itself Cognizant Technology Solutions. 

In July 1997, Dun &amp; Bradstreet bought Satyam&#x27;s 24% stake in DBSS for $3.4 million. Headquarters were moved to the United States, and in March 1998, Kumar Mahadeva was named CEO. Operating as a division of the Cognizant Corporation, the company focused on Y2K-related projects and web development.

In 1998, the parent company, Cognizant Corporation, split into two companies: IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research. After this restructuring, Cognizant Technology Solutions became a public subsidiary of IMS Health. In June 1998, IMS Health partially spun off the company, conducting an initial public offering of the Cognizant stock. 

In 2003, IMS Health sold its entire 56% stake in Cognizant, which instituted a poison pill provision to prevent hostile takeover attempts. Kumar Mahadeva resigned as the CEO in 2003, and was replaced by Lakshmi Narayanan. Gradually, the company&#x27;s services portfolio expanded across the IT services landscape and into business process outsourcing (BPO) and business consulting. Lakshmi Narayanan was succeeded by Francisco D&#x27;Souza in 2006. 

In September 2014, Cognizant acquired healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $2.7 billion. Cognizant shares rose nearly 3 percent in pre-market trading.

On 24 June 2015, the company signed a multimillion-dollar agreement with Escorts Group in India to help Escorts&#x27; businesses in digital transformation and modernize its operations across all business segments.

On 30 June 2015, it partnered with Singapore-based supermarket retailer NTUC FairPrice to perform digital transformation in NTUC&#x27;s business to improve personalized and consistent customer service across multiple channels.

On 1 April 2019, Francisco D&#x27;Souza was replaced by Brian Humphries as the CEO.

In January 2022, Cognizant sold its acquisition Oy Samlink to Kyndryl and Mustache to DJE Holdings.

In 2023, Ravi Kumar S was named as CEO of Cognizant.

On 22 April 2024, Cognizant announced its partnership with Microsoft Corporation to extend its reach of Generative AI and Copilots, also to enhance experiences of employee and speed up their cross-industry innovation.

== Criticism and controversies ==
 

=== India ===

==== Bribery ====
Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd (L&amp;T) paid million in bribes to Indian government officials on behalf of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. to secure permits, ranging from environmental clearance to power. L&amp;T has made illicit payments and Cognizant reimbursed the money by disguising it as compensation for cost overruns.

==== Companies Act violations ====
In March 2019, significant publicity was raised because Cognizant repetitively violated the directives of the Registrar of Companies. The Company &quot;has moved [sic] the Madras High Court fearing possibility of criminal prosecution being launched against it by [the] Registrar of Companies for alleged violation of the provisions of the Companies Act of 2013 and the Companies (Appointment and Disqualification of Directors) Rules of 2014.&quot; One of those questions was as to why the company had not disclosed complete information on stock options of its parent holding company — CTS Corporation in the United States — having been given to the employees, including its directors, and the payments running to several hundred crores of rupees (approx US $40 million) having been paid to the parent company in the US towards stock compensating recharge.

==== Discrimination ====
In 2018, a race discrimination suit was brought: &quot;Three former employees claim they were forced out of their jobs and replaced with &#x27;less qualified&#x27; Indians after being poorly treated by their Indian supervisors and colleagues, given unjustifiably low performance ratings and denied promotions.&quot; Cognizant said it was &quot;national origin&quot; and not race. In a 2024 retrial, a jury found the company had discriminated and should pay damages

==== Layoffs ====
200 senior executives, above the Director&#x27;s Level were dismissed because they were not able to catch up with the latest technologies. The number of the executives that were dismissed is unusually high and questions the ability of the company to catch up with the latest technologies.

In 2017, eight employees filed petitions with the labor department, complaining Cognizant forced them to resign as part of a performance-based review. The labor department closed the case in favor of employees and advised company management to give one more opportunity for the petitioners to prove themselves. At the time Cognizant had also rolled out a ‘voluntary separation program’ for directors, associate vice-presidents and senior VP&#x27;s which compensated them with 6–9 months of their salary.

In 2017, approximately 6000 Cognizant employees in Hyderabad/Bangalore/Chennai lost their job as a part of company&#x27;s annual performance review process.

On July 1, 2023, Cognizant acquired the Microsoft/Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience US medical scribes division. On January 8, 2024, Cognizant laid off over 700 of those US medical scribes and managers to migrate the US hospital accounts to their Indian scribes division in a rolling/tiered fashion with termination dates at the end of February and March 2024. In addition, approximately 40 of the US employees (thus not triggering the WARN Act, which stipulates a minimum of 50 employees) were terminated immediately on January 8, 2024, with only 1 month&#x27;s severance pay instead of the 2 months&#x27; severance that would have been required by the WARN Act.

==== Tax evasion ====
The Income Tax department has frozen Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp&#x27;s bank accounts and deposits in Chennai and Mumbai for allegedly evading a dividend distribution tax (DDT). A Cognizant spokesman confirmed the report and said in a statement that a court has instructed the tax department not to take further action pending further hearings. Cognizant failed to pay the tax of more than 25 billion rupees ($385 million) in the 2016–17 financial year, according to &quot;The Hindu&quot;, citing officials from the tax department.

The court asked the company to deposit 15 percent of the disputed tax, amounting to 4.9 billion rupees ($75 million) as security deposit till it decides on the case.

=== Ireland ===
==== Working conditions ====
In February 2018 the UK and Irish press expressed concerns about contractors employed by Cognizant in Dublin as part of the outsourcing contract with Google about the conditions of employment in relationship to compensation and basic employment allowances like sick leave.

=== United States ===
==== Corruption ====
In 2016, Cognizant announced that it was cooperating with US authorities in an investigation related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and carrying out its own probe to determine whether some payments made in India breached the law. The company also said President Gordon Coburn had resigned and would be replaced by Rajeev Mehta.

==== Crawford &amp; Company lawsuit ====
Cognizant has been sued by Crawford &amp; Company, the US-based independent providers of insurance claims-handling services, for alleged breach of contract. Cognizant had been mandated by Crawford to implement PeopleSoft Financials software as part of an ERP project called Project Atlas that it was critical to Crawford&#x27;s operations. Project Atlas included components for both internal operations and client-facing services.

==== Wage theft and H-1B visa violations ====
Cognizant leads the ranks of companies receiving H-1B visas from the United States. The company has been steadily increasing its U.S. work force. In January 2011, the company announced plans to expand its U.S. delivery centers, including a new 1,000-person (0.4% of worldwide workforce) facility in Phoenix, Arizona. 

In 2009, an investigation by the US Department of Labor (DoL) found Cognizant in violation of the H-1B provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Administrative Act. The DoL discovered that the company had stolen wages and benefits from 67 of its workers, for which they demanded they repay $509,607 in back wages. Joseph Petrecca, the director of the Wage and Hour Division&#x27;s Northern New Jersey District Office noted that the company took immediate steps to correct the violations, saying the &quot;level of cooperation sets a standard for others in the industry.&quot;

In 2016, the company was the subject of a lawsuit by workers for Walt Disney World who said workers from India were brought into the United States on H-1B visas in order to replace them. However, in October 2016, federal Judge Gregory A. Presnel of the United States District Court in Orlando dismissed the lawsuits, stating &quot;none of the allegedly false statements put at issue in the complaint are adequate.&quot;

Cognizant was also required to pay $5.7 million in back pay and fines in a U.S. District Court ruling for a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit claimed that Cognizant did not provide quality assurance analysts the full value of their overtime pay.

==== Working conditions and mental health issues ====
In February 2019, an investigative report by &quot;The Verge&quot; described poor working conditions in Cognizant&#x27;s Phoenix, Arizona, office. Cognizant employees tasked with content moderation for Facebook developed mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder, as a result of exposure to graphic violence, hate speech, and conspiracy theories in the videos they were instructed to evaluate. Moderators at the Phoenix office reported drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and sexual intercourse in the workplace, and feared retaliation from terminated workers who threatened to harm them. In response, a Cognizant representative stated the company would examine the issues in the report.

&quot;The Verge&quot; published a follow-up investigation of Cognizant&#x27;s Tampa, Florida, office in June 2019. Employees in the Tampa location described working conditions that were worse than the conditions in the Phoenix office. Content moderator Keith Utley suffered a heart attack while working for Cognizant in March 2018 and died in a hospital; the Tampa office lacked an on-site defibrillator. Moderators were required to sign non-disclosure agreements with Cognizant to obtain the job, although three former workers broke the agreements to provide information to &quot;The Verge&quot;. In the Tampa office, workers reported bed bugs, unsanitary work conditions, inadequate mental health resources, sexual harassment, workplace violence, and theft. As a result of exposure to videos depicting graphic violence, animal abuse, and child sexual abuse, some employees developed psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder. Cognizant sanitized the office before &quot;The Verge&quot;″s visit, a practice the publication described as a &quot;dog-and-pony-show phenomenon&quot;. In response to negative coverage related to its content moderation contracts, a Facebook director indicated that Facebook is in the process of developing a &quot;global resiliency team&quot; that would assist its contractors.

On October 30, 2019, Cognizant announced that it would phase out a portion of its content moderation contracts in 2020.

<text>Tito Schipa (; born Raffaele Attilio Amedeo Schipa; 2 January 1889 in Lecce16 December 1965) was an Italian tenor.

== Biography ==

Schipa was born as Raffaele Attilio Amedeo Schipa on 27 December 1888 in Lecce in Apulia into an Arbëreshë family; his birthday was recorded as January 2, 1889 for military conscription purposes. He studied in Milan and made his operatic debut at age 21 in 1910 at Vercelli. He subsequently appeared throughout Italy and in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1917, he created the role of Ruggiero in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La rondine&quot;.

In 1919, Schipa traveled to the United States, joining the Chicago Opera Company. He remained with the Chicago company until 1932, whereupon he appeared at the New York Metropolitan Opera from 1932 to 1935, and again in 1941. He also sang at the San Francisco Opera, beginning in 1924.

From 1929 to 1949 he performed regularly in Italy, including at La Scala, Milan and the Rome Opera. He returned to Buenos Aires to sing in 1954. In 1957, he toured the Soviet Union.

Schipa&#x27;s artistry is preserved on film. In 1929, he appeared in two Vitaphone movie shorts, singing &quot;M&#x27;appari&quot; from Flotow&#x27;s opera &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Una furtiva lagrima&quot; from Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;.

Schipa&#x27;s stage repertoire, which in his early career had encompassed a wide range of Verdi and Puccini roles, eventually contracted to about 20 congenial Italian and French operatic roles, including Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and Cilea&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;arlesiana&quot;. In concert, Schipa performed a preferred array of lyrical operatic arias and songs, including Neapolitan and Spanish popular songs.

Schipa made numerous recordings of arias and songs during his career, beginning in Italy in 1913. His recorded output included a famous 78-rpm set of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, made in 1932. This is still available on CD. He also recorded several tangos, some of which were composed by him in Spanish, mostly in Buenos Aires and New York. Thanks to his early Latin American tours, Schipa was a very popular tenor in Latin America.

Like his contemporary Richard Tauber, Tito Schipa was also a conductor. Although a few contemporary critics considered Schipa&#x27;s voice to be small in size, restricted in range and slightly husky in timbre, he was still extremely popular with the public. Michael Scott (&quot;The Record of Singing&quot;: 1978), while admiring Schipa&#x27;s charm and taste, points out that it is not correct to say that Schipa was a master of &quot;bel canto&quot;; indeed Scott and others regard Schipa&#x27;s recording of &quot;Il mio tesoro&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; as one of the worst ever made, with sloppy runs and sketchy ornamentation.

Yet his performance of the entire aria during a Metropolitan Opera broadcast of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; on January 20, 1934, as well as surviving fragments from a “live” New Orleans performance of the opera in 1935, show him in superb form. &quot;Although the quality of one or two of Mr. Schipa&#x27;s top notes was rather tenuous,&quot; New York critic Francis D. Perkins wrote in the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; in January 1934, “the style and phrasing of his aria was usually artistic and well schooled.”

On July 18, 1919, he was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the Lodge &quot;Espartana&quot; of Buenos Aires. In 1939, Tito Schipa declined an invitation from Italian-American groups to perform 12 concerts in order to raise money for the Anti-Fascist movement in Italy. Although he was offered $1,000 for each appearance, Schipa refused and is quoted in his letter, dated February 23, 1939, &quot;I am sorry that I cannot sing for Loubet; but you MUST understand my situation; and my relationship with Achille Starace in Italy and all authorities there. And you know the purpose of the benefit for which Loubet asks me to sing for. Not tell anybody the reason; tell that I cannot come to New York or some other excuse; but don&#x27;t ask me the impossible&quot;.

Schipa sang his final performance at the Metropolitan Opera in 1941 before returning to Fascist Italy, &quot;where he was a pet of the Benito Mussolini regime&quot;, an association he would never really live down; after returning to the United States, his first post war concert was poorly attended but when he came out of retirement one last time in 1962, Town Hall was jammed. In 1958, Schipa retired from the operatic stage to teach voice, initially in Budapest. He returned to New York for one last concert performance in 1962; Town Hall was full to overflowing. Schipa died of complications from diabetes on December 16, 1965 at the age of 77 in Manhattan, New York City, while teaching there.

==Legacy==
He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

His son Tito Schipa Jr. is a composer, singer-songwriter, producer, writer and actor.

It is located in the province of Oulu and is part of the Northern Ostrobothnia region. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Neighbour municipalities are Haapavesi, Kärsämäki, Nivala, Pihtipudas, Pyhäjärvi, Reisjärvi and Sievi.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==
Haapajärvi was first mentioned in 1548 as &quot;Hapaierffue&quot; (a Swedish transcription of the Finnish name), when it was a part of the parish of Kalajoki. Many of the initial settlers of the area were Savonians, including the Herranen and Ronka(i)nen families already mentioned in 1543 as settlers in Kalajoki. According to the oldest known (1547) tax documents regarding the area, at least half of Haapajärvi&#x27;s inhabitants were Savonians. Due to this, the area of Haapajärvi (including Pidisjärvi) was known as &quot;Kalajoen Savo&quot; in the 16th century. Savonian influence is still present in the Central Ostrobothnian dialect spoken in Haapajärvi. 

The men of Jämsä held hunting grounds in the area; opposed to the settlement on their lands, men from Jämsä attacked the Savonian settlements of the Kalajoki and Pyhäjoki valleys in 1551. The settlers soon notified the king of Sweden (Gustav Vasa), who forbade the Tavastians from disturbing the new settlements, however also stating that the Tavastians were allowed to settle on their own hunting grounds as well. 

The first church was built in 1649 or 1653. Haapajärvi acquired chapel rights in 1698 and became an independent parish in 1838, also including the chapel communities of Pidisjärvi and Reisjärvi. Both Reisjärvi and Pidisjärvi (Nivala) were separated in 1868.

A chapel was built in the village of Olkkola for the Laestadian community in the 1920s, however it has never been officially designated as a church or a chapel. Olkkola was a chapel community from 1927 to 1978.

Haapajärvi became a town (&quot;kaupunki&quot;) in 1977.

<text>Rui Jorge de Sousa Dias Macedo de Oliveira (born 27 March 1973), known as Rui Jorge, is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a left-back, currently manager of the Portugal national under-21 team.

In a 15-year professional career he spent 14 seasons in the Primeira Liga, mainly in representation of Porto and Sporting CP, playing 292 matches and scoring seven goals in the competition. At international level, he played for Portugal at the 2002 World Cup and two European Championships. 

After retiring from playing at age 33, Rui Jorge became a manager, starting with a short stint at Belenenses. He was appointed coach of the Portugal under-21 team in 2010.

==Club career==
Rui Jorge was born in Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto District. Having emerged through local FC Porto, he made his professional debut with Rio Ave F.C. in the Segunda Liga, returning to his first club in 1992 after one season. Never an undisputed starter with the former (only appearing in more than 20 games twice over a six-year spell) he did help the northern side to five Primeira Liga championships and three domestic cups.

In July 1998, Rui Jorge signed with Sporting CP, where he would remain for the following seven years, being first choice during most of his stint and adding two more leagues to his trophy cabinet, with the double being conquered in 2002. In the 2005–06 campaign he played with another Lisbon team, C.F. Os Belenenses, subsequently retiring from the game – aged 33, with more than 400 official appearances – and joining his final club&#x27;s youth coaching staff.

==International career==
Rui Jorge played for the Portugal under-21 side which lost the 1994 UEFA European Championship final to Italy (2–1) and the Olympic team who finished fourth at the 1996 Summer Olympics in the United States. He also had 45 caps at full level, two while at Porto and 43 when with Sporting, and scored once in a 7–1 away win over Andorra on 1 September 2001. His first game for the latter was a 0–0 draw with Norway on 20 April 1994 in a friendly, and he represented his country at UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004.

Rui Jorge&#x27;s participation at Euro 2004 on home soil was jeopardised when he tested positive in February that year for Budesonide, commercially known as Pulmicort. He said that the substance came from a medically recommended spray for his rhinitis. His suspension was lifted in May, with the fault placed on Sporting for not notifying authorities of his medical exemption; at the tournament, he was one of four players – three from defence – dropped by Luiz Felipe Scolari after the opening 2–1 loss to Greece, and did not return for the remainder of the competition, which Portugal lost in the final to the same team.

==Coaching career==
In May 2009, Rui Jorge was appointed Belenenses&#x27; head coach for the final two matches of the season, taking over from Jaime Pacheco after a 0–5 home loss against S.C. Braga, with the team eventually ranking second from bottom (being later reinstated). At the end of the campaign, he returned to the youth ranks.

On 19 November 2010, Rui Jorge replaced Oceano at the helm of the Portuguese under-21s. He led them to the 2015 European Championships in the Czech Republic after ten wins in as many matches in the qualifying phase, and coached them to the second place in the finals following a penalty shootout defeat against Sweden.

Rui Jorge coached the Portuguese at the 2016 Olympic tournament in Brazil, where they lost 4–0 to Germany in the quarter-finals. He was also in charge for the 2017 edition of the under-21 continental tournament, which ended in group stage exit. On 10 October 2017, six years after the last loss for that stage of the competition, he was on the bench as the team lost 3–1 in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the 2019 European Championship qualifiers.

In November 2020, having already qualified for the 2021 European Championship, Rui Jorge celebrated a decade in the job; at that point he was the most experienced under-21 manager in Europe, and had served longer than all but four senior managers in the world. At the finals in Hungary and Slovenia the following June, his team finished as runners-up.
