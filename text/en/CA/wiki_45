<text>A royal yacht is a ship used by a monarch or a royal family. If the monarch is an emperor the proper term is imperial yacht. Most of them are financed by the government of the country of which the monarch is head. The royal yacht is most often crewed by personnel from the navy and used by the monarch and their family on both private and official travels.

Some royal yachts have been small vessels only used for short trips on rivers or in calm waters, but others have been large seaworthy ships.

==History==
Depending on how the term is defined royal yachts date back to the days of antiquity with royal barges on the Nile in ancient Egypt.

Later the Vikings produced royal vessels. They followed the pattern of longships although highly decorated and fitted with purple sails (purple sails remained standard for royal vessels the next 400 years).

In England, Henry V sold off the royal yachts to clear the Crown&#x27;s debts. The next royal vessels in England were built in the Tudor period with Henry VIII using a vessel in 1520 that was depicted as having cloth of gold sails. James I had &quot;Disdain&quot;, a ship in miniature (she was later recorded as being able to carry about 30 tons), built for his son Prince Henry. &quot;Disdain&quot; was significant in that she allowed for pleasure cruising and as a result can be seen as an early move away from royal ships as warships.

The first ships to unquestionably qualify as royal yachts were those owned by Charles II of England Scotland and Ireland. The first was gift from the Dutch but later yachts were commissioned and built in England. This established a tradition of royal yachts in Britain that was later copied by other royal families of Europe. Through the 19th century royal yachts got larger as they became a symbol of national wealth. World War I brought this trend to an end and the royal families that survived found it harder to justify the cost with the result that there are only three royal yachts left in use in Europe. For the most part royal yachts have been superseded by the use of warships in this role, as royal yachts are often seen as a hard-to-justify expenditure. In addition most monarchies with a railway system employ a special set of ceremonial royal carriages. Most monarchies are also granted access to government owned aircraft for transportation.

<text>A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were usually held the lord&#x27;s manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely (though erroneously) applied to various English country houses, mostly at the smaller end of the spectrum, sometimes dating from the Late Middle Ages, which currently or formerly house the landed gentry.

Manor houses were sometimes fortified, albeit not as fortified as castles, but this was often more for show than for defence. They existed in most European countries where feudalism was present.

==Function==
The lord of the manor may have held several properties within a county or, for example in the case of a feudal baron, spread across a kingdom, which he occupied only on occasional visits. Even so, the business of the manor was directed and controlled by regular manorial courts, which appointed manorial officials such as the bailiff, granted copyhold leases to tenants, resolved disputes between manorial tenants and administered justice in general. A large and suitable building was required within the manor for such purpose, generally in the form of a great hall, and a solar might be attached to form accommodation for the lord.

The produce of a small manor might be insufficient to feed a lord and his large family for a full year, and thus he would spend only a few months at each manor and move on to another where stores had been laid up. This also gave the opportunity for the vacated manor house to be cleaned, especially important in the days of the cess-pit, and repaired. Thus such non-resident lords needed to appoint a steward or &quot;seneschal&quot; to act as their deputy in such matters and to preside at the manorial courts of his different manorial properties. The day-to-day administration was carried out by a resident official in authority at each manor, who in England was called a bailiff, or reeve.

==Architecture==

Although not typically built with strong fortifications as were castles, many manor-houses were fortified, which required a royal licence to crenellate. They were often enclosed within walls or ditches which often also included agricultural buildings. Arranged for defence against roaming bands of robbers and thieves, in days long before police, they were often surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge, and were equipped with gatehouses and watchtowers, but not, as for castles, with a keep, large towers or lofty curtain walls designed to withstand a siege. The primary feature of the manor house was its great hall, to which subsidiary apartments were added as the lessening of feudal warfare permitted more peaceful domestic life.

By the beginning of the 16th century, manor houses as well as small castles began to acquire the character and amenities of the residences of country gentlemen, and many defensive elements were dispensed with, for example Sutton Place in Surrey, . A late 16th-century transformation produced many of the smaller Renaissance châteaux of France and the numerous country mansions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean styles in England. These would eventually evolve into country houses with the estate replacing the manor.

==History in England==

Manor houses were often built in close proximity to the village for ease, as they served not just as a home for the lord of the manor, but as a centre of administration for those who lived or travelled within the bounds of the manor. In some instances they needed to be able to hold meetings of the Manorial court.

Nearly every large medieval manor house had its own deer-park adjoining, imparked (i.e. enclosed) by royal licence, which served primarily as a store of food in the form of venison. Within these licensed parks deer could not be hunted by royalty (with its huge travelling entourage which needed to be fed and entertained), nor by neighbouring land-owners nor by any other persons.

===Decline of the manor house===

Before around 1600, larger houses were usually fortified, generally for true defensive purposes but increasingly, as the kingdom became internally more peaceable after the Wars of the Roses, as a form of status symbol, reflecting the position of their owners as having been worthy to receive royal licence to crenellate. The Tudor period (16th century) of stability in England saw the building of the first of the unfortified great houses, for example Sutton Place in Surrey, circa 1521.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII resulted in many former monastical properties being sold to the King&#x27;s favourites, who then converted them into private country houses, examples being Woburn Abbey, Forde Abbey, Nostell Priory and many other mansions with the suffix Abbey or Priory to their name.

During the second half of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and under her successor King James I (1603–1625) the first mansions designed by architects not by mere masons or builders, began to make their appearance. Such houses as Burghley House, Longleat House, and Hatfield House are among the best known of this period and seem today to epitomise the English country house.

During the 16th century many lords of manors moved their residences from their ancient manor houses often situated next to the parish church and near or in the village and built a new manor house within the walls of their ancient deer-parks adjoining. This gave them more privacy and space.

==Naming==
While suffixes given to manor houses in recent centuries have little substantive meaning, and many have changed over time, in previous centuries manor names had specific connotations.
* Court – This suffix came into use in the 16th century and was applied to the buildings where lords would receive their tenants (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;hold court&quot;).
* Castle – Non-royal castles were generally the residences of feudal barons, whose baronies might comprise several dozen other manors. The manor on which the castle was situated was termed the &quot;caput&quot; of the barony, thus every true ancient defensive castle was also the manor house of its own manor. The suffix &quot;-Castle&quot; was also used to name certain manor houses, generally built as mock castles, but often as houses rebuilt on the site of a former true castle:
* Place – The &quot;Place&quot; suffix is likely to have been a shortened form of &quot;Palace&quot;, a term commonly used in Renaissance Italy (&quot;Palazzo&quot;) to denote a residence of the nobility.
* Park – came into use in the 18th and 19th centuries
* &#x27;Manor&#x27; Suffix - Romantic Revival - Manor houses, although mostly forming residences for the lords of the manors on which they were situated, were not historically named with the suffix &quot;Manor&quot;, as were many grand country houses built in the 19th century, such as Hughenden Manor or Waddesdon Manor.

The usage is often today used as a modern catch-all suffix for an old house on an estate, true manor or not.

==Similar constructions==

*Tower Houses – Tower houses, including Peel towers, were constructed in the wilder parts of England, usually in the marches. They served a defensive purpose, built as a solid fortified keep, they were designed to protect inhabitants from raids by border reivers. Though the lord lived in the tower and their followers lived in simple huts outside the walls, the towers were designed to provide a refuge so that, when cross-border raiding parties arrived, the whole population of a village could take to the tower and wait for the marauders to depart.
*Lodges – Some of the land in England was designated as Royal forest during the feudal era. These areas were under forest law, which was historically distinct from the law of the rest of the country and operated outside the common law, serving to protect game animals and their forest habitat from destruction. Kings would appoint &#x27;Wardens&#x27;, &#x27;Keepers&#x27;, or &#x27;Guardians&#x27; to oversee these lands, who would often be provided Lodges that functioned similarly to manor houses.
*Clergy dwellings – As the often second most important individual in a feudal manor, clergy dwellings often incorporated many of the elements of a manor house. Some manors were themselves clerical and so the manor house and vicarage/rectory were one and the same. Properties such as rectories in England were often supported by their own Glebe – land within the parish/manor set aside to support a parish priest.

==In other jurisdictions==
===France===
In France, the terms &quot;château&quot; or &quot;manoir&quot; are often used synonymously to describe a French manor house; &quot;maison-forte&quot; is the appellation for a strongly fortified house, which may include two sets of enclosing walls, drawbridges, and a ground-floor hall or &quot;salle basse&quot; that was used to receive peasants and commoners. The term &quot;manoir&quot; is used historically only in Normandy and in Brittany. The &quot;salle basse&quot; was also the location of the manorial court, with the steward or seigneur&#x27;s seating location often marked by the presence of a &quot;crédence de justice&quot; or wall-cupboard (shelves built into the stone walls to hold documents and books associated with administration of the demesne or &quot;droit de justice&quot;). 

The &quot;salle haute&quot; or upper-hall, reserved for the seigneur and where he received his high-ranking guests, was often accessible by an external spiral staircase. It was commonly &quot;open&quot; up to the roof trusses, as in similar English homes. This larger and more finely decorated hall was usually located above the ground-floor hall. The seigneur and his family&#x27;s private &quot;chambres&quot; were often located off of the upper first-floor hall, and invariably had their own fireplace (with finely decorated chimney-piece) and frequently a latrine.

In addition to having both lower and upper halls, many French manor houses also had partly fortified gateways, watchtowers, and enclosing walls that were fitted with arrow or gun loops for added protection. Some larger 16th-century manors, such as the Château de Kerjean in Finistère, Brittany, were even outfitted with ditches and fore-works that included gun platforms for cannons. These defensive arrangements allowed &quot;maisons-fortes&quot; and rural manors to be safe from a &quot;coup de main&quot; perpetrated by an armed band, many of which roamed the countryside during the troubled times of the Hundred Years War and the French wars of religion; but these fortified manor houses could not have withstood a lengthy siege undertaken by a regular army equipped with (siege) engines or heavy artillery.

===Germany===

The German equivalent of a manor house is a &quot;Gutshaus&quot; (or &quot;Gut&quot;, &quot;Gutshof&quot;, &quot;Rittergut&quot;, &quot;Landgut&quot; or &quot;Bauerngut&quot;). Also &quot;Herrenhaus&quot; and &quot;Domäne&quot; are common terms. &quot;Schloss&quot; (pl. Schlösser) is another German word for a building similar to manor house, stately home, château or palace. Other terms used in German are &quot;&quot; (castle), &quot;&quot; (fort/fortress) and &quot;Palais&quot;/&quot;Palast&quot; (palace).

German language uses terms like Schloss or Gutshaus for places that functioned as the administrative center of a manor. Gut(shaus) implies a smaller ensemble of buildings within a more agricultural setting, usually owned by lower-ranking landed gentry whereas Schloss describes more representative and larger places. During the 18th century, some of these manor houses became local centers of culture where the local gentry, sometimes inspired by what they had experienced during their grand tour, was mimicking the lifestyle of the higher nobility, creating lavish parks, art collections or showed an interest in science and research.
===Netherlands===

There are many historical manor houses throughout the Netherlands. Some have been converted into museums, hotels, conference centres, etc. Some are located on estates and in parks.

Many of the earlier houses are the legacy of the feudal &quot;heerlijkheid&quot; system. The Dutch had a manorial system centred on the local lord&#x27;s demesne. In Middle Dutch this was called the &quot;vroonhof&quot; or &quot;vroenhoeve&quot;, a word derived from the Proto-Germanic word &quot;fraujaz&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;. This was also called a &quot;hof&quot; and the lord&#x27;s house a &quot;hofstede&quot;. Other terms were used, including &quot;landhuis&quot; (or just &quot;huis&quot;), a &quot;ridderhofstad&quot; (Utrecht), a &quot;stins&quot; or &quot;state&quot; (Friesland), or a &quot;havezate&quot; (Drente, Overijssel and Gelderland). Some of these buildings were fortified. A number of castles associated with the nobility are found in the country. In Dutch, a building like this was called a &quot;kasteel&quot;, a &quot;slot&quot;, a &quot;burcht&quot; or (in Groningen) a &quot;borg&quot;.

During the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century, merchants and regents looking for ways to spend their wealth bought country estates and built grand new homes, often just for summer use. Some purchased existing manor houses and castles from the nobility. Some country houses were built on top of the ruins of earlier castles that had been destroyed during the Dutch Revolt. The owners, aspiring to noble status, adopted the name of the earlier castle.

These country houses or stately homes (called &quot;buitenplaats&quot; or &quot;buitenhuis&quot; in Dutch) were located close to the city in picturesque areas with a clean water source. Wealthy families sent their children to the country in the summer because of the putrid canals and diseases in the city. A few still exist, especially along the river Vecht, the river Amstel, the Spaarne in Kennemerland, the river Vliet and in Wassenaar. Some are located near former lakes (now polders) like the Wijkermeer, Watergraafsmeer and the Beemster. In the 19th century, with improvements in water management, new regions came into fashion, such as the Utrecht Hill Ridge (Utrechtse Heuvelrug) and the area around Arnhem.

Today there is a tendency to group these grand buildings together in the category of &quot;castles&quot;. There are many castles and buitenplaatsen in all twelve provinces. A larger-than-average home is today called a villa or a herenhuis, but despite the grand name this is not the same as a manor house.

===Poland===

The architectural form of the Polish manor house ( or &quot;dworek&quot;) evolved around the late Polish Renaissance period and continued until the Second World War, which, together with the communist takeover of Poland, spelled the end of the nobility in Poland. A 1944 decree nationalized most mansions as property of the nobles, but few were adapted to other purposes. Many slowly fell into ruin over the next few decades.

Poland inherited many German-style manor houses (&quot;Gutshäuser&quot;) after parts of eastern Germany were taken over by Poland after World War II.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, it was quite common during the 17th to early 20th centuries for the aristocracy to have country homes. These homes, known as solares (paços, when the manor was a certain stature or size; &quot;quintas&quot;, when the manor included a sum of land), were found particularly in the northern, usually richer, Portugal, in the Beira, Minho, and Trás-os-Montes provinces. Many have been converted into a type of hotel called pousada.

Quinta is a term used in the Portuguese language-speaking world, which is applied variously to manors homes or to estates as a whole.

===Spain===
Casa solariega is the catch-all name for manor houses in Spain. They were the places where heads of noble families resided. Those houses receive a different name depending on the geographical region of Spain where they are located, the noble rank of the owner family, the size of the house and/or the use that the family gave to them. In Spain many old manor houses, palaces, castles and grand homes have been converted into a Parador hotel.

A Palacio is a sumptuously decorated grand residence, especially a royal residence or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop. The word itself is derived from the Latin name Palātium, for Palatine Hill, the hill which housed the Imperial residences in Rome. Palacio Real is the same as Palacio, but historically used (either now or in the past) by the Spanish royal family. Palacio arzobispal is the same as Palacio, but historically used by the ecclesiastic authorities (mainly bishops or archbishops).

Alcázar is a type of Moorish castle or fortified palace in Spain (and also Portugal) built during Muslim rule, although some founded by Christians. Mostly of the alcázars were built between the 8th and 15th centuries. Many cities in Spain have its alcázar. Palaces built in the Moorish style after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain are often referred to as alcazars as well.

Hacienda is landed estates of significant size located in the south of Spain (Andalusia). They were also very common in the former Spanish colonies. Some haciendas were plantations, mines or factories. Many haciendas combined these productive activities. They were developed as profit-making, economic enterprises linked to regional or international markets. The owner of an hacienda was termed an &quot;hacendado&quot; or &quot;patrón&quot;. The work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located.

Casona is old manor houses in León, Asturias and Cantabria (Spain) following the so-called &quot;casa montañesa architecture&quot;. Most of them were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. Typologically they are halfway between rustic houses and palaces

Quinta is a countryside house closer to the urban core. Initially, &quot;quinta&quot; (fifth) designated the 1/5 part of the production that the lessee (called &quot;quintero&quot;) paid to the lessor (owner of the land), but lately the term was applied to the whole property. This term is also very common in the former Spanish colonies.

Alqueria in Al-Andalus made reference to small rural communities that were located near cities (medinas). Since the 15th century it makes reference to a farmhouse, with an agricultural farm, typical of Levante and the southeastern Spanish, mainly in Granada and Valencia.

A &quot;pazo&quot; is a type of grand old house found in Galicia. A &quot;pazo&quot; is usually located in the countryside and the former residence of an important nobleman or other important individual. They were of crucial importance to the rural and monastic communities around them. The &quot;pazo&quot; was a traditional architectural structure associated with a community and social network. It usually consisted of a main building surrounded by gardens, a dovecote and outbuildings such as a small chapels for religious celebrations. The word &quot;pazo&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;palatiu(m)&quot; (&quot;palace&quot;).

The Baserri, called &quot;Caserio&quot; in Spanish, is the typical manor house of the Basque Provinces and Navarre. A baserri represents the core unit of traditional Basque society, as the &quot;ancestral home of a family&quot;. Traditionally, the household is administered by the &quot;etxekoandre&quot; (lady of the house) and the &quot;etxekojaun&quot; (master of the house), each with distinctly defined rights, roles and responsibilities. When the couple reaches a certain age upon which they wish to retire, the baserri is formally handed over to a child. Unusually, the parents were by tradition free to choose any child, male or female, firstborn or later born, to assume the role of &quot;etxekoandre&quot; or &quot;etxekojaun&quot; to ensure the child most suitable to the role would inherit the ancestral home. The baserri under traditional law (the &quot;fueros&quot;) cannot be divided or inherited by more than one person. This is still the case in the Southern Basque Country but the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in France, under which such practices are illegal, greatly upset this tradition in the North. Although the Basques in the north chose to be &quot;creative&quot; with the new laws, it overall resulted in the breakup and ultimate financial ruin of many baserris. In practice the tradition of not breaking up baserris meant that the remaining children had to marry into another baserri, stay on the family baserri as unmarried employees or make their own way in the world (&quot;Iglesia o mar o casa real&quot;, &quot;Church or sea or royal house&quot;).

A cortijo is a type of traditional rural habitat in the Southern half of Spain, including all of Andalusia and parts of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha. &quot;Cortijos&quot; may have their origins in ancient Roman villas, for the word is derived from the Latin &quot;cohorticulum&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;cohors&quot;, meaning &#x27;courtyard&#x27;. They are often isolated structures associated with a large family farming or livestock operation in the vast and empty adjoining lands. It would usually include a large house, together with accessory buildings such as workers&#x27; quarters, sheds to house livestock, granaries, oil mills, barns and often a wall enclosing a courtyard. The master of the &quot;cortijo&quot; or &quot;señorito&quot; would usually live with his family in a two-story building, while the accessory structures were for the labourers and their families —also known as &quot;cortijeros&quot;.

===United States===
Before the founding of the United States, colonial powers such as Britain, France and the Netherlands made land grants to favored individuals in the original colonies that evolved into large agricultural estates that resembled the manors familiar to Europeans. Founding fathers such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were the owners of large agricultural estates granted by colonial rulers and built large manor houses from which these estates were managed (e.g., Mount Vernon, Monticello).

American agricultural estates, however, often relied on slaves rather than tenant farmers or serfs which were common in Europe at the time. The owners of American agricultural estates did not have noble titles and there was no legally recognized political structure based on an aristocratic, land-owning class. As a result, this limited the development of a feudal or manorial land-owning system to just a few regions such as Tidewater and Piedmont Virginia, the Carolina Low Country, the Mississippi Delta, and the Hudson River Valley in the early years of the republic.

Today, relics of early manorial life in the early United States are found in a few places such as the Eastern Shore of Maryland with examples such as Wye Hall and Hope House (Easton, Maryland), Virginia at Monticello and Westover Plantation, the Hudson River Valley of New York at Clermont State Historic Site or along the Mississippi such as Lansdowne (Natchez, Mississippi). Over time, these large estates were usually subdivided as they became economically unsustainable and are now a fraction of their historical extent. In the southern states, the demise of plantation slavery after the Civil War gave rise to a sharecropping agricultural economy that had similarities to European serfdom and lasted into the early 20th century. The Biltmore Estate in North Carolina (which is still owned by descendants of the original builder, a member of the Vanderbilt family) is a more modern, though unsuccessful, attempt at building a small manorial society near Asheville, North Carolina.

Most manor-style homes built since the Civil War were merely country retreats for wealthy industrialists in the late 19th and early 20th century and had little agricultural, administrative or political function. Examples of these homes include Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts), Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site and Hearst Castle. A rare example of hereditary estate ownership in the United States that includes a manor-type house is Gardiners Island, a private island that has been in the same family since the 17th century and contains a Georgian architecture house. Today, some historically and architecturally significant manor houses in the United States are museums. However, many still function as private residences, including many of the colonial-era manor houses found in Maryland and Virginia a few of which are still held within the original families.

Unlike in Europe, the United States did not create a native architectural style common to manor houses. A typical architectural style used for American manor-style homes in the mid-Atlantic region is Georgian architecture although a homegrown variant of Georgian did emerge in the late 1700s called Federal architecture. Other styles borrowed from Europe include Châteauesque with Biltmore Estate being an example, Tudor Revival architecture see Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park, and Neoclassical architecture with Monticello being a prominent example. In the Antebellum South, many plantation houses were built in Greek Revival architecture style.
Virginia House is a former 16th-entury English manor house blending three romantic English Tudor designs. In 1925, it was relocated to Richmond, Virginia from main sections dating from the 1620 remodeling of a priory in Warwickshire, England and reconstructed on a hillside overlooking the James River in Windsor Farms. Virginia House is now owned and operated by the Virginia Historical Society. The almost eight acres of gardens and grounds on which Virginia House rests were designed by Charles Gillette. The house has been preserved and is largely as it was when the Weddells lived there. Virginia House is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Richmond, Virginia.

<text>Stojan Protić (; 28 January 1857 – 28 October 1923) was a Serbian politician and writer. He served as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes between 1918 and 1919, and again in 1920, later called Yugoslavia. He is best remembered as the key theoretician of Serbian parliamentarism.

==Biography==
Stojan M. Protić was born in Kruševac. His great-great-grandfather (&quot;čukundeda&quot;), Toma Dečanac, moved from the village of Dečani to Kruševac with his wife and two sons.

Having studied history and philosophy in Belgrade&#x27;s Grandes écoles (&quot;Velika škola&quot;), Protić briefly worked in government service before dedicating himself to journalism and becoming editor of &quot;Samouprava&quot; (&quot;Autonomy&quot;), the official daily newspaper of the People&#x27;s Radical Party. In 1884, he became the editor of another paper, &quot;Odjek&quot; (&quot;Echo&quot;), and advocated changing Serbia&#x27;s constitution. He ran in the 1887 elections and was elected to the Parliament. As secretary of the Constitutional committee in 1888 Protić participated in drafting the Serbian Constitution, perhaps one of the most liberal constitutions in late nineteenth-century Europe. He became an influential ideologist of the People&#x27;s Radical Party and a talented journalist. He continued to write numerous articles for several political magazines while in the office.

Protić was often elected as a deputy of the People&#x27;s Radical Party in the Serbian Parliament in the following years, 1887, 1897, 1901, 1903, 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1912. Known as an ardent polemist and advocate of British-type democracy, he served as a deputy in the first Yugoslav parliament (1920) as well.

He was the Minister of Interior in various governments in Serbia after 1903 (Administrations of Jovan Avakumović, Sava Grujić, Nikola Pašić), as well as the Minister of Finance (1909-1912). As the Minister of the Interior at the outbreak of World War I, he worked on the Serbian reply to the Austro-Hungarian Ultimatum during the July Crisis. He supported the Corfu Declaration (1917), opposed the Geneva Declaration (November 9, 1918), and sought to revise the Vidovdan Constitution. In December 1918, Protić was appointed the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes by Prince-Regent Aleksandar Karađorđević. His government, unfortunately, lasted from 20 December 1918 to 16 August 1919. He was the Prime Minister once more from 19 February to 17 May 1920. In 1923, after leaving the Radicals, led by Pašić, he formed a new party the Independent Radical Party (Nezavisna Radikalna Stranka) but failed to gain support. After losing his parliamentary seat in his traditional constituency in Kruševac, Protić quit politics.

His books translated into English, German, Russian and French were published under the pseudonym &quot;Balkanicus&quot;.

== Death ==

Protić died of heart disease in Belgrade in 1923.

His great-grandson is Milan St. Protić, a historian, politician and diplomat who served as the Mayor of Belgrade.

<doc id="769419" wikidata="Q3129298" url="?curid=769419" title="Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)">
<text>Alexander Luis González (born February 15, 1977) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball shortstop. González played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins (1998–2005), Boston Red Sox (2006, 2009), Cincinnati Reds (2007–2009), Toronto Blue Jays (2010), Atlanta Braves (2010–2011), Milwaukee Brewers (2012–2013) and Detroit Tigers (2014). He was given the nickname &quot;Sea-bass&quot; while playing in Florida. He bats and throws right-handed.

==Playing career==

===Florida Marlins===
In 1999, while with the Florida Marlins, González made the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

In 2001, he led all Major League shortstops with 26 errors.

González played an important role in the 2003 World Series against the Yankees. After going 1-for-13 in the first three games of the World Series, he hit a walk-off home run in the 12th inning of Game 4 to give the Marlins a 4–3 victory and a 2–2 tie in the Series. The extra innings happened because Florida&#x27;s closer Ugueth Urbina blew a 3–1 lead in the ninth. In Game 5, González hit a two-out game-tying double and later scored, helping the Marlins take a 3–2 series lead. González added an extra run in the sixth and final game, when he slid around catcher Jorge Posada, eluding him and brushing the plate with his left hand. Florida beat the odds with a 2–0 victory and won the World Series.

One of his most productive seasons came in 2004, when he posted career highs in at bats (561) and games played (159), tied a career high in home runs (23), yet also had a career high in strikeouts (126).

===Boston Red Sox===
Before the 2006 season, the Boston Red Sox signed González as a free agent to a one-year contract worth $3 million, plugging a hole in the starting lineup after the trade of shortstop Édgar Rentería to the Atlanta Braves. He reunited with former Marlins&#x27; teammates Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell who were traded from Florida to Boston earlier.

González&#x27;s signing with the Sox marked the second time he had replaced Rentería as the shortstop; Renteria had just left the Marlins for the St. Louis Cardinals before González joined the team in 1998.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On November 18, 2006, he signed a three-year, $14 million contract with the Cincinnati Reds. In 2008, an MRI showed that Gonzalez still had a fracture in his left knee.

He was named Player of the Week for the week of April 29, 2007.

When González was hurt in February, it looked like he&#x27;d be back in the middle of April. Gonzalez had surgery on the knee in July, however, and ultimately missed the entire 2008 season.

===Boston Red Sox (second stint)===
On August 14, 2009, González cleared waivers with the Cincinnati Reds and was traded back to the Boston Red Sox with $1.1 million for Single A shortstop Kristopher Negron. From August 15 through the end of the regular season, González appeared in 44 games for Boston, batting .284 with 5 home runs and 15 RBIs.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On November 26, 2009, González signed a one-year deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a club option for a second year.

===Atlanta Braves===
On July 14, 2010, González was traded along with prospects Tim Collins and Tyler Pastornicky to the Atlanta Braves for shortstop Yunel Escobar and Jo-Jo Reyes.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 8, 2011, González was signed in free agency by the Milwaukee Brewers. He signed a one-year deal with a vesting option for 2013 if he has at least 525 plate appearances in 2012. He will make $4.25 million in 2012, and would make $4 million in 2013. On May 5, 2012, Gonzalez was placed on the 15-day disabled list after suffering a right knee injury earlier in the day in a game at the San Francisco Giants. He was then placed on the disabled list after revealing that he had a torn ACL, and remained there for the rest of the season. During the offseason Gonzalez played in the Venezuelan Winter League for the Leones del Caracas. González filed for free agency after the World Series, but ultimately re-signed with the Brewers on a one-year, $1.5 million deal. He was released on June 3, 2013.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On January 31, 2014, González signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He never appeared in a game with the Orioles.

===Detroit Tigers===
On March 24, 2014, González was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Steve Lombardozzi Jr., who never played in Tigers uniform. In his Tigers debut Opening Day against the Kansas City Royals, Gonzalez hit an RBI-triple to tie the game in the seventh inning, and later hit a walk-off single in the ninth to give the Tigers a 4–3 victory. He was released on April 20, 2014.

<doc id="769420" wikidata="Q2946609" url="?curid=769420" title="Black sigatoka">
<text>Black sigatoka is a leaf-spot disease of banana plants caused by the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Morelet), also known as black leaf streak. It was discovered in 1963 and named for its similarities with yellow Sigatoka, which is caused by &quot;Mycosphaerella musicola&quot; (Mulder), which was itself named after the Sigatoka Valley in Fiji. In the same valley an outbreak of &quot;this&quot; disease reached epidemic proportions from 1912 to 1923.

According to new terminology, the Sigatoka disease complex is a cluster of three closely related fungi: Black Sigatoka and its congeners Yellow Sigatoka (&quot;Ps. musae&quot;) and eumusae leaf spot (&quot;Ps. eumusae&quot;).

Plants with leaves damaged by the disease may have up to 50% lower yield of fruit, and control can take up to 50 sprays a year.

== Life history ==
&quot;M. fijiensis&quot; reproduces both sexually and asexually, and both conidia and ascospores are important in its dispersal. The conidia are mainly waterborne for short distances, while ascospores are carried by wind to more remote places (the distances being limited by their susceptibility to ultraviolet light). Over 60 distinct strains with different pathogenic potentials have been isolated. To better understand the mechanisms of its variability, projects to understand the genetic diversity of &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; have been initiated.

When spores of &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; are deposited on a susceptible banana leaf, they germinate within three hours if the humidity is high or a film of water is present. The optimal temperature for germination of the conidia is . The germ tube grows epiphytically over the epidermis for two to three days before penetrating the leaf through a stoma. Once inside the leaf, the invasive hypha forms a vesicle and fine hyphae grow through the mesophyll layers into an air chamber. More hyphae then grow into the palisade tissue and continue on into other air chambers, eventually emerging through stomata in the streak that has developed. Further epiphytic growth occurs before the re-entry of the hypha into the leaf through another stoma repeats the process. The optimal conditions for &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; as compared with &quot;M. musicola&quot; are a higher temperatures and higher relative humidity, and the whole disease cycle is much faster in &quot;M. fijiensis&quot;.

== Symptoms ==

Black Sigatoka is also known as black leaf streak, causing streaks that run parallel to the leaves. It affects banana trees specifically in tropical climates; including Asia, West Africa, China, and South America. Tropical weather is the preferred climate for banana cultivation, but it is also the environment where the pathogen thrives: hot and humid, with plenty of rainfall to aid in dispersal. The optimal environment of the pathogen is similar to that of the banana tree. The fungus infects mature banana leaves and will continue to cause infection without proper control.

In the early stages of the infection of the plant, the lesions have a rusty brown appearance and appear to be faint, paint-like specks on the leaves. They become more visible on the undersides of the banana leaf as the lesions and leaves grow. The spots on the undersides of leaf are the fungus itself. The sign of the pathogen consists of the ascocarp which holds the ascospores used for dissemination to infect healthy new plants when the environment is conducive. The pathogen then survives on dead plant tissue as mycelium. The dimensions of the lesions are characteristically with a well defined wall surrounding it. After further development, they become darker, sink into the leaf, and turn into depressions. The depressions themselves and the chlorosis surrounding them are the visible symptoms of the plant pathogen. They eventually will merge, causing the rapid decline of plant morphological and physiological function. Leaves with large infectious lesions will start to degrade and collapse because the leaf spots interrupt the plant&#x27;s ability to perform photosynthesis, leading to the ultimate death of the plant.

The yellow leaf streak pathogen is in the same genus as that of black leaf streak. Yellow leaf streak shows smaller, yellow-green lesions that appear on top of the leaves.

== Management ==
There are several ways to control black Sigatoka, either by cultural and chemical means or by genetic engineering. Cultural control includes the destruction of leaves that have been infected with &quot;M. fijiensis.&quot; This will help reduce the initial (ascospores) and secondary (conidia) spread of inoculum of new plant leaves and interrupt the pathogen&#x27;s polycyclic disease cycle. Another way of reducing primary/secondary inoculums is via efficient drainage and irrigation. Keeping the environment around the plants at low humidity helps keep the ascospores/conidia produced by the pathogen from being dispersed in the water draining towards other healthy, susceptible hosts. Other techniques include planting the banana trees more than above sea level and practicing multi-cropping, mixing banana with other trees or vegetation.

One form of chemical control is preemptive use of fungicides on banana trees in order to protect them from primary inoculum. The fungicide does not kill the pathogen itself, but works on the pre-necrotic spots on the leaves, stopping the secondary spores from inoculating new, healthy plant tissue. The best time to apply this protective fungicide is in the beginning of the season in order to stop any initial infection. The class of fungicides widely used to control black leaf streak is the triazoles. These are demethylation inhibitors and should be rotated with compounds having other modes of action to slow the development of resistance. Leaves that have already been infected must be removed mechanically to save the rest of the tree. Research has shown that there may be fungicide resistance developing for &quot;M. fijiensis&quot;. It has been observed that following the intensive application of chemicals, the fungus persisted and spread. The same observations were found in fields with no chemical interference; the belief now being that the untreated fields are “breeding grounds for (the) development of resistant strains”. Methyl benzimidazole carbamates are also used and there is also resistance known to these. Although fitness penalties are common in resistance evolution many MBC resistant pathogens do not suffer any penalty and a few have the opposite effect. &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; is one such case: Romero &quot;et al.&quot;, 1998 find MBC resistant isolates benefit from enhanced virulence (specifically tested with benomyl).

Research today shows continuous action towards reinventing banana breeding programs. However, some cultivars of bananas are resistant to the disease. Research is done to improve productivity and fruit properties of these cultivars. A genetically modified banana variety made more resistant to the fungus was developed and was field tested in Uganda in the late 2000s. Furthermore, the search for genetic resistance shows promise with the discovery of a protein that can produce a hypersensitive response to control &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; that is being introduced into banana trees. This may lead to the identification of a resistance gene that could be transferred to banana trees.

== Importance ==
The worldwide spread of the disease has been rapid, with its naming and first reported occurrence in 1963. The disease was reported in 1972 in Honduras, from where it spread north to central Mexico and south to Brazil and into the Caribbean islands in 1991. The fungus arrived in Zambia in 1973 and spread to the banana-producing areas of Africa from that introduction. The first occurrence of black Sigatoka in Florida was reported in 1999. As it spread, Black Sigatoka replaced the yellow form and has become the dominant disease of bananas worldwide.

The most likely route of infection is via the importation of infected plant material, and infection can spread rapidly in commercial areas where bananas are farmed in monoculture. Removal of affected leaves, good drainage, and sufficient spacing also help to fight the disease. Although fungicides improved over the years, the pathogen developed resistance. Therefore, higher frequency of applications is required, increasing the impact on the environment and health of the banana workers. In regions where disease pressure is low and fungicide resistance has not been observed, it is possible to better time the application of systemic fungicides by using a biological forecasting system.

Bananas are a principal crop for people with limited access to other resources, and the decrease in production of the fruit can limit their diet. There is also the possibility that the cost of bananas will rise with the substantial loss of bananas, leading to unaffordability. &quot;M. fijiensis&quot; has been found in all regions of the world that are major producers of bananas and is a constraint for these countries; specifically, Africa, Asia, and South America. Black Sigatoka is a very destructive disease to the foliage of banana trees. The disruption of photosynthesis can reduce fruit yield by up to 50%. Infection with black streak deaf can interrupt ripening, causing fruit to “ripen prematurely and unevenly, and as a result becoming unsuitable for export”. A disruption in the maturation of the fruit can lead to a major shift in the economy of the international commerce. 10% of the bananas that are grown are sold to other countries while the other 90% is consumed by the farmers and local communities. Small farmers growing bananas for local markets cannot afford expensive measures to fight the disease. Black Sigatoka of Bananas threatens the fruit&#x27;s economy and the lives of the people who depend on the fruit for subsistence.

<text>Clintonia is a genus of flowering plants in the lily family Liliaceae. Plants of the genus are distributed across the temperate regions of North America and eastern Asia, in the mesic understory of deciduous or coniferous forests. The genus, first described by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1818, was named for DeWitt Clinton (1769–1828), a naturalist and politician from the U.S. state of New York. For this reason, plants of the genus are commonly known as Clinton&#x27;s lily. The common name bluebead (and by extension bluebead lily) refer to the distinctive fruit of members of the genus. Since fruit color varies somewhat across species, the common name bead lily is used as well.

== Description ==

The genus &quot;Clintonia&quot; is morphologically diverse. Species are herbaceous perennial plants growing from rhizomatous underground stems with thin, fibrous roots. They grow from 1.5 to 8 dm tall. They have 2 to 6 basal leaves arising from the rhizome crown, the basal leaves are sessile and sheathing, and the cauline leaves have a stalk. The blade of each leaf has a prominent central vein and entire margins, and the bottom ends are obovate to oblanceolate in shape. The leaf apex is acute to abruptly short-acuminate, often mucronate (ending abruptly in a short sharp point). The inflorescences are terminal, and the flowers are arranged into short racemes or umbel-like clusters, with 1 to 45 flowers. The flowers have 6 tepals with nectaries present. The stamens are inserted at the base of the perianth, and the anthers are oblong-obovate to oblong-linear shaped. The rounded to cylinder shaped ovary is superior with two chambers (sometime three). Each chamber produces 2 to 10 ovules. The smooth fruits are berry-like, round to egg-shaped, metallic blue to black in color. Four to thirty seeds are produced in each fruit and the seeds are shiny brown, round and the ends are angled with 2 or 3 faces.

== Taxonomy ==

, &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; (POWO) accepts the following species in the genus &quot;Clintonia&quot; :
POWO also accepts the infraspecies &quot;Clintonia udensis&quot; var. &quot;alpina&quot; but some authorities do not accept this name.

Molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrate two major disjunct clades, in eastern Asia and in North America respectively, and with the latter in East and in West. Within the family Liliaceae, &quot;Clintonia&quot; is a sister group to &quot;Medeola&quot;.

=== Asia ===

The species &quot;C. udensis&quot; is found in eastern Asia, from the Russian Far East to southeast Asia, extending from the Kuril Islands in the Pacific Ocean to the Western Himalaya region.

== Ecology ==

Spring blooming.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Clintonia&quot; species are cultivated as garden subjects in shade gardens, grown for the glossy foliage, small lily-like flowers, and blue fruits, and their ability to live in heavy shade. They grow best in cool, organic-rich, acid soils that retain moisture and when grown well form dense slowly spreading clumps.

<text>Pierre-Paul Prud&#x27;hon (, 4 April 1758 – 16 February 16, 1823) was a French Romantic painter and draughtsman best known for his allegorical paintings and portraits such as &quot;Madame Georges Anthony and Her Two Sons&quot; (1796). He painted a portrait of each of Napoleon&#x27;s two wives.

He was an early influence on Théodore Géricault and Constance Mayer, who may have influenced him as well, due to their intimate working relationship.

==Biography==
Pierre-Paul Prud&#x27;hon was born in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France. He received his artistic training in the French provinces and went to Italy when he was twenty-six years old to continue his education. On his return to Paris, he found work decorating some private mansions, often allegorical works such as &quot;The Soul Breaking the Links Holding it to the Earth&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Happiness&quot;. His work for wealthy Parisians led him to be held in high esteem at Napoleon&#x27;s court.

His painting of Josephine portrays her not as an Empress, but as an attractive woman, which led some to think that he might have been in love with her. After the divorce of Napoleon and Josephine, he was also employed by Napoleon&#x27;s second wife Marie-Louise.

Prud&#x27;hon was at times clearly influenced by Neo-classicism, at other times by Romanticism. He was appreciated by other artists and writers, including Stendhal, Delacroix, Millet and Baudelaire, for his chiaroscuro and convincing realism. He painted &quot;Crucifixion&quot; (1822) for St. Etienne&#x27;s Cathedral in Metz; it now hangs in the Louvre.

The young Théodore Géricault had painted copies of work by Prud&#x27;hon, whose &quot;thunderously tragic pictures&quot; include his masterpiece, &quot;Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime&quot;, where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously anticipate Géricault&#x27;s painting &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;.

<text>Ramón José Hernández Marin (; born May 20, 1976) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball catcher and current major league staff assistant for the Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB with the Oakland Athletics (1999–2003), San Diego Padres (2004–2005), Baltimore Orioles (2006–2008), Cincinnati Reds (2009–2011), Colorado Rockies (2012) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2013).

==Career==
===Oakland Athletics===
Hernández made his debut with Oakland on June 29, 1999 as a backup catcher for A. J. Hinch. His steady progress enabled the Athletics to trade Hinch to the Kansas City Royals a year later.

With experience, Hernández became known as a catcher who could solidly hit, mentor young pitchers and had steady defense. He earned praise for his defense and game-calling skills with a powerful pitching staff that included Cy Young Award winner Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson.

In 2003, Hernández broke out with his best season, hitting .273 with 21 home runs and 78 RBI and made his first All-Star Game. His most memorable moment as an Athletic came in Game 1 of the 2003 ALDS against the Boston Red Sox. With the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 12th inning, Hernández bunted down the third base line, which scored Eric Chavez to win the game. After the season on November 26, Oakland traded him to the San Diego Padres along with outfielder Terrence Long in exchange for outfielder Mark Kotsay. At the time of the deal, Hernández had caught at least 135 games each of the prior four years.

===San Diego Padres===
In both 2004 and 2005, Hernández battled injuries. On June 20, 2004 against the Toronto Blue Jays, he strained his left knee after being involved in a collision at home plate. The injury sidelined him for four weeks; he was activated on July 26. Upon his return, he batted .281 with 11 home runs and 38 RBI in the second half. He finished the 2004 season with a .276 batting average, 18 home runs, and 63 RBI in 111 games.

In 2005, he suffered a wrist injury on June 17 while diving into first base during a game against the Minnesota Twins. His jammed wrist forced him to the disabled list, causing him to miss 18 games. Hernández returned to the lineup on July 7, but the condition worsened and he decided to have surgery to repair the torn cartilage. The surgery forced Hernández to the DL for the third time in two seasons, and he missed the entire month of August. He rejoined the team in time for the September stretch run, and was pivotal in the Padres&#x27; run to the National League West championship. Hernández hit .359 in September with five home runs, and drove in 20 runs in just 22 games. He came up with several clutch hits, including two dramatic game-winning home runs: a three-run walk-off shot against Washington in the 12th inning on September 17, and a grand slam against division rival San Francisco just 10 days later. He finished the season with a .290 average, 12 home runs and 58 RBI in 99 games. With his performance, Hernández became one of baseball&#x27;s more coveted players in the winter&#x27;s free agent market.
===Baltimore Orioles===
On December 8, 2005, Hernández agreed to a four-year, $27.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. The contract included a team option for the 2010 season as well. In his introductory press conference, Hernández spoke excitedly about working with a young pitching staff, hitting in Camden Yards and helping the team become a contender. He also expressed optimism about spending the next four years with Miguel Tejada as a teammate. (Two years, as it turned out; Tejada was traded to the Astros before the 2008 season). Hernández and Tejada had been teammates in Oakland for almost five years, and are godfathers to each other&#x27;s children. Hernández would compile a respectable .275 batting average in 2006 with 23 home runs and 91 RBI. Veterans Chris Widger and Danny Ardoin served as Hernández&#x27;s backups throughout the season.

===Cincinnati Reds===
Hernández was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Ryan Freel and minor leaguers Justin Turner and Brandon Waring on December 9, 2008. Following the season, the Reds signed Hernandez to a one-year, $3 million contract.

===Colorado Rockies===

On November 30, 2011, Hernandez signed a two-year contract with the Colorado Rockies. He played 52 games for the Rockies and four games for the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the 2012 season.

On March 28, 2013, towards the end of spring training, the Rockies designated Hernández for assignment.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On April 6, 2013, the Rockies traded Hernández to the Los Angeles Dodgers for pitcher Aaron Harang. In 17 games as the Dodgers backup catcher, he hit .208 with three home runs and 6 RBI. He was designated for assignment on June 14, and released on June 22.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
The Toronto Blue Jays signed Hernández on June 30, 2013, and assigned him to their Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons.

Hernández was released on July 9 after playing in five games for the Bisons and hitting .105 (2-for-19) with 2 RBI.

===Kansas City Royals===
Hernández signed a minor league deal with an invitation to Spring Training with the Kansas City Royals on January 7, 2014. He opted out of his deal on March 23 and became a free agent.

==Post playing career==
On December 20, 2022, Hernández was hired by the Oakland Athletics as a staff assistant/interpreter for the 2023 season.

On November 1, 2024, Hernández was elected to the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 76% of the votes from the Contemporary Committee.

<doc id="769434" wikidata="Q7456758" url="?curid=769434" title="Setoid">
<text>In mathematics, a setoid (&quot;X&quot;, ~) is a set (or type) &quot;X&quot; equipped with an equivalence relation ~. A setoid may also be called E-set, [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]] set, or extensional set.

Setoids are studied especially in proof theory and in type-theoretic foundations of mathematics. Often in mathematics, when one defines an equivalence relation on a set, one immediately forms the quotient set (turning equivalence into equality). In contrast, setoids may be used when a difference between identity and equivalence must be maintained, often with an interpretation of intensional equality (the equality on the original set) and extensional equality (the equivalence relation, or the equality on the quotient set).

==Proof theory==
In proof theory, particularly the proof theory of constructive mathematics based on the Curry–Howard correspondence, one often identifies a mathematical proposition with its set of proofs (if any). A given proposition may have many proofs, of course; according to the principle of proof irrelevance, normally only the truth of the proposition matters, not which proof was used. However, the Curry–Howard correspondence can turn proofs into algorithms, and differences between algorithms are often important. So proof theorists may prefer to identify a proposition with a &quot;setoid&quot; of proofs, considering proofs equivalent if they can be converted into one another through beta conversion or the like.

==Type theory==
In type-theoretic foundations of mathematics, setoids may be used in a type theory that lacks quotient types to model general mathematical sets. For example, in Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s intuitionistic type theory, there is no type of real numbers, only a type of regular Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. To do real analysis in Martin-Löf&#x27;s framework, therefore, one must work with a &quot;setoid&quot; of real numbers, the type of regular Cauchy sequences equipped with the usual notion of equivalence. Predicates and functions of real numbers need to be defined for regular Cauchy sequences and proven to be compatible with the equivalence relation. Typically (although it depends on the type theory used), the axiom of choice will hold for functions between types (intensional functions), but not for functions between setoids (extensional functions). The term &quot;set&quot; is variously used either as a synonym of &quot;type&quot; or as a synonym of &quot;setoid&quot;.

==Constructive mathematics==
In constructive mathematics, one often takes a setoid with an apartness relation instead of an equivalence relation, called a constructive setoid. One sometimes also considers a partial setoid using a partial equivalence relation or partial apartness (see e.g. Barthe &quot;et al.&quot;, section 1).

<doc id="769435" wikidata="Q3126021" url="?curid=769435" title="Hall J. Kelley">
<text>Hall Jackson Kelley (February 24, 1790 – January 20, 1874) was an American settler and writer from New England known for his strong advocacy for settlement by the United States of the Oregon Country in the 1820s and 1830s. A native of New Hampshire, he was a school teacher in Maine and Massachusetts, and a longtime resident of the latter state after graduating from Harvard College.

In 1834 Kelley led an expedition to Oregon Country. He became ill in the Northwest and was virtually deported by the head of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company district office at Fort Vancouver. After his return to Massachusetts, he continued to write about the territory to encourage its settlement, also submitting materials to Congress. In 1868 he published a book about the region, by which time the emigrants on the Oregon Trail had already numbered into the tens of thousands. Kelley Point Park in Portland, Oregon, is named for him, as he had encouraged settlement at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers.

==Early years==
Hall Kelley was born in Northwood, New Hampshire, on February 24, 1790. He left school and began teaching in Hallowell, Maine, at the age of 16.

He graduated from Middlebury in Vermont in 1814 with an A.M. degree, and then graduated from Harvard College in 1820. Kelley also worked as school principal in Boston from 1818 to 1823. On May 4, 1815, he married Mary Baldwin, daughter of a minister.

==Career==
Kelley worked as a railroad surveyor in Maine. He also helped design a project for a canal from Boston to the Connecticut River, which was never built. He designed a railroad between Veracruz, Veracruz, and Mexico City.

As early as 1815, after reading about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the expedition by Wilson Price Hunt, Kelley became interested in U.S. settlement of the area west of the Rocky Mountains. He tried to organize a group expedition overland to that region in 1828, but they could not get the funds for outfitting. He followed that effort with a failed attempt to colonize the Puget Sound area with an ocean-based expedition.

Also in 1828, he persuaded the Massachusetts Legislature to charter a society to promote U.S. settlement along the Columbia River. At the time, the Oregon Country was under joint administration of the U.S. and Great Britain pursuant to the Anglo-American Convention of 1818. Effectively the area was under control of the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which actively discouraged U.S. settlement.

Kelley wrote articles to encourage U.S. settlers to move into Oregon Country. This included a memorial to the United States Congress on February 11, 1828, that laid out plans for a city where the Columbia River meets the Willamette River (present-day Portland, Oregon) and a proposal to name mountains in the Cascade Range after US presidents. In 1830, he published a &quot;Geographical Memoir of Oregon&quot;, which contained the first map of that territory ever compiled, as well as a settlement guide for prospective emigrants.

Kelley&#x27;s writings were influential in inspiring Benjamin Bonneville to undertake his 1832 expedition to the West. He also espoused a theory as to the origin of the name Oregon, claiming it came from the Orjon River in Chinese Tartary.

==Expedition to Oregon==
In 1831 Kelley sought to undertake an expedition to the west with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth of Boston, and they assembled a party of several hundred men. Delays forced the last-minute abandonment of the plan. Wyeth went west in 1832 without Kelley, having attracted investors in Boston.

In 1833, Kelley set out with a smaller party for the West, traveling first to New Orleans. Most of the men left the expedition, causing great personal expense to Kelley. Hoping to salvage his expedition, he sailed south to Veracruz, Mexico. After many hardships, he recruited a party of U.S. citizens from Monterey, then under Mexican rule. The party crossed Mexico to California, where Kelley, along with Joseph Gale, joined the party of trader Ewing Young. The latter was moving into the Oregon Country backed by the missionary Jason Lee.
Kelley traveled northward by horse train with the Young party in 1834. On the trip north, Kelley fell ill with malaria while among the Coquille tribe in the Umpqua River valley near present-day Roseburg, Oregon. He was rescued by Michel LaFramboise, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) employee at Fort Umpqua near present-day Tyee.

Kelley wrote of the experience:

:&quot;Captain (LaFramboise) engaged an Indian chief to take me in a canoe, forty or fifty miles down the Umpqua. At first the chief declined, saying, that the upper part of the river was not navigable. Finally, in view of a bountiful reward, he consented to try... At the landing, the faithful Indian received of my property, a fine horse, saddle and bridle, a salmon knife and a scarlet velvet sash, and was satisfied.&quot;

Kelley and the party arrived at the Columbia River on October 27, 1834. In Oregon, Kelley and his party were directed to leave by John McLoughlin, district chief at Fort Vancouver of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). At this time, the HBC was very powerful in the Northwest and Canada; Great Britain and the United States disputed over the boundary and control in the Oregon Country. Both had private companies involved in fur trading.

After Kelley had recovered, McLoughlin gave him passage in 1835 to Hawaii. From there, Kelley found a ship and sailed home to Boston.

Kelley continued to write newspaper articles and memoirs based on his trip that encouraged Americans to settle Oregon. On February 16, 1839, parts of memoirs of his Oregon trip were presented to the United States Congress in a report on the region. Kelley&#x27;s report was bound with a finely engraved map, showing the &quot;Territory of Oregon&quot; that was &quot;compiled in United States Bureau of Topographical Engineers from the latest authorities under the direction of Col. J. J. Abert by Washi. Hood, 1838.&quot; He petitioned Congress 1851 for reimbursement for his expenses on the 1834 trip, but was unsuccessful.

==Later years==
Kelley spent his later years in Three Rivers, Massachusetts. In 1868, he wrote &quot;A History of the Settlement of Oregon and of the Interior of Upper California, and of Persecutions and Afflictions of Forty Years&#x27; Continuance endured by the Author.&quot; Hall Jackson Kelley died in Massachusetts on January 20, 1874, at the age of 83, He was buried in Palmer.

==Legacy and honors==
Kelley Point and Kelley Point Park, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers in Portland, Oregon, are named for him.

During the early 1830s, Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the &quot;Presidents Range&quot;, with each major peak to be named after a former President of the United States. Kelley intended Mount Hood to be named &quot;Mount Adams&quot; in honor of John Adams. A mapmaker mistakenly placed the Mount Adams name north of Mount Hood by about 40 miles (64 km), east of Mt. St. Helens. By coincidence, there was a mountain there with no official United States name. It became known as Mount Adams, despite the failure of Kelley&#x27;s plan to rename the entire range.

<doc id="769439" wikidata="Q1208241" url="?curid=769439" title="Avalanche effect">
<text>In cryptography, the avalanche effect is the desirable property of cryptographic algorithms, typically block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions, wherein if an input is changed slightly (for example, flipping a single bit), the output changes significantly (e.g., half the output bits flip). In the case of high-quality block ciphers, such a small change in either the key or the plaintext should cause a drastic change in the ciphertext. The actual term was first used by Horst Feistel, although the concept dates back to at least Shannon&#x27;s &quot;diffusion&quot;.

If a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization, and thus a cryptanalyst can make predictions about the input, being given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break the algorithm. Thus, the avalanche effect is a desirable condition from the point of view of the designer of the cryptographic algorithm or device. Failure to incorporate this characteristic leads to the hash function being exposed to attacks including collision attacks, length extension attacks, and preimage attacks. 

Constructing a cipher or hash to exhibit a substantial avalanche effect is one of the primary design objectives, and mathematically the construction takes advantage of the butterfly effect. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks. Both of these features allow small changes to propagate rapidly through iterations of the algorithm, such that every bit of the output should depend on every bit of the input before the algorithm terminates.

== Strict avalanche criterion ==
The strict avalanche criterion (SAC) is a formalization of the avalanche effect. It is satisfied if, whenever a single input bit is complemented, each of the output bits changes with a 50% probability. The SAC builds on the concepts of completeness and avalanche and was introduced by Webster and Tavares in 1985.

Higher-order generalizations of SAC involve multiple input bits.
Boolean functions which satisfy the highest order SAC are always bent functions,
also called maximally nonlinear functions,
also called &quot;perfect nonlinear&quot; functions.

== Bit independence criterion ==
The bit independence criterion (BIC) states that output bits &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; should change independently when any single input bit &quot;i&quot; is inverted, for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.

<text>Dragonsong is a science fantasy novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. Released by Atheneum Books in March 1976, it was the third to appear of the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series set on the fictional planet Pern. &quot;Dragonsong&quot; had a new publisher, editor, and target audience of young adults, and became the first book in the &quot;Harper Hall of Pern&quot; trilogy. The original &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; trilogy with Ballantine Books was not completed until after the publication of &quot;Dragonsong&quot; and its sequel.

&quot;Dragonsong&quot; and the second Pern book &quot;Dragonquest&quot; are set at the same time, seven years after the end of the seminal &quot;Dragonflight&quot; — that is, more than 2500 years after human settlement, during the &quot;Ninth Pass&quot; of the Red Star that periodically brings a biological menace from space. Their primary geographical settings are not distant in space yet worlds apart: &quot;Dragonsong&quot; in an isolated sea-hold and &quot;Dragonquest&quot; at the centers of Pernese society, the weyrs and major holds, especially Benden Weyr. Near the end of &quot;Dragonsong&quot;, the protagonist Menolly is rescued by a dragonrider, and the action converges with that of &quot;Dragonquest&quot;.

==Origins==
McCaffrey finished &quot;Dragonquest&quot;, a sequel to the first Pern book, soon after her 1970 emigration to Ireland but she wrote several stories and a few books before completing the original &quot;Dragonriders&quot; trilogy. Writing &quot;The White Dragon&quot; did not really begin until 1974/75 after the New England Science Fiction Association invited her to its annual convention Boskone as Guest of Honor, which included the special publication of a small book for sale on site.

The market for young adults provided crucial opportunities while &quot;Dragonriders&quot; stalled. Editor Roger Elwood sought contributions of short work to anthologies and McCaffrey started the Pern story of Menolly for him, although in the end she delivered four 1973/74 stories that later became &quot;Crystal Singer&quot;. Editor Jean E. Karl, who had established the children&#x27;s and science fiction imprints at Atheneum Books, sought to attract more female readers to science fiction and solicited &quot;a story for young women in a different part of Pern&quot;. McCaffrey completed Menolly&#x27;s story as &quot;Dragonsong&quot; and contracted for a sequel before it was out in 1976.

Like &quot;Crystal Singer&quot;, &quot;Dragonsong&quot; features a young woman with great musical talent. Beside fishing, its focus in Pernese society is the arts and education, in contrast to the military and political focus of the original trilogy. In this the action at Harper Hall rather than the Weyrs is akin to McCaffrey&#x27;s own experience. At Radcliffe College, Harvard, she majored in Slavonic Languages and literature. From her teens through her thirties, before she turned to writing full-time, she pursued musical avocations: piano lessons, voice training and performance, and assisting in amateur production of musicals and operettas.

==Plot summary==
Taking place seven years after the events of &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, the book opens with Menolly, youngest daughter of Masterfisher Yanus, Sea Holder of Half-Circle Seahold, in the fictional world of Pern. Menolly, a gifted young musician, has been assisting the Hold&#x27;s ailing Harper Petiron in his duties to educate the Hold&#x27;s children. After Petiron&#x27;s death, however, a new Harper arrives as his replacement. Menolly&#x27;s parents forbid her to reveal that she has been teaching the children in the interim, believing that music and particularly teaching are not a woman&#x27;s place. To conceal her former role from the new Harper, Menolly is not allowed to play, sing, or compose, and her parents severely punish her for doing so. Unbeknownst to Menolly or her parents, prior to his death Petiron sent several of Menolly&#x27;s original compositions to Masterharper Robinton at Harper Hall, where Robinton is now frantic to locate this mysterious new composer, though unaware that the composer is female.

Frustrated and heartbroken, Menolly chooses to leave her Hold and live Holdless, a dangerous enterprise as flesh-eating Thread fall regularly on the area. She is entirely unaware that Masterharper Robinton has directed the new harper at Half-Circle Seahold to find the composer in order to train them as a Harper. Menolly finds a safe cave near the sea and makes it her new home. She also discovers a nest of the legendary fire-lizards, smaller versions of the giant dragons that defend Pern from Thread. She assists the fire-lizard queen in relocating her clutch to safety, thereby winning the creature&#x27;s trust. Menolly is present when the clutch hatches and inadvertently Impresses nine hatchlings, forming a symbiotic, psychic bond with them and making herself responsible for their care. Feeding both her fire-lizards and herself is a full-time job, but Menolly is resourceful and content. She resumes her music and is delighted when her fire-lizards learn to harmonize with her songs.

One day while gathering food for her fire-lizards, Menolly is caught on the edge of Threadfall. She attempts to race the leading edge back to the safety of her cave, lacerating the soles of her feet in the effort. A passing dragonrider rescues her at the last second and takes her to Benden Weyr, which is full of guests in preparation for a dragon hatching. Menolly is shocked to find others at the Weyr have fire-lizards and that the creatures&#x27; discovery and potential has become a point of deep interest to dragonriders. When Menolly&#x27;s nine fire-lizards come looking for her, Menolly reluctantly admits that she accidentally Impressed them all, thus becoming the center of attention.

Robinton, who is present at Benden for the Hatching, is intrigued that Menolly has taught her fire-lizards to sing. On the pretense of having Menolly show him her fire-lizards&#x27; ability, Robinton tricks her into performing one of the songs written by Petiron&#x27;s mysterious apprentice, thus revealing that she is the composer. Menolly is overwhelmed when Robinton invites her to Harper Hall to become his apprentice and gladly accepts the offer.

==Themes==
Fixed gender roles make Menolly an outcast, as she is unskilled at tasks which are regarded as women&#x27;s work on Pern and excels in the male-dominated field of music. She chooses to live alone in the dangerously unprotected world outside the Hold instead of allowing her natural talents to be suppressed.

==Awards==
The American Library Association in 1999 cited the two early Pern trilogies (&quot;Dragonriders&quot; and &quot;Harper Hall&quot;), along with &quot;The Ship Who Sang&quot;, when McCaffrey received the annual Margaret A. Edwards Award for her &quot;lifetime contribution in writing for teens&quot;.

<text>The Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science () was a German scientific institution established in the German Empire in 1911. Its functions were taken over by the Max Planck Society. The Kaiser Wilhelm Society was an umbrella organisation for many institutes, testing stations, and research units created under its authority.

== Constitution ==
The Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG) was founded in 1911 in order to promote the natural sciences in Germany, by founding and maintaining research institutions formally independent from the state and its administrations. The institutions were to be under the guidance of prominent directors, which included the physicists and chemists Walther Bothe, Peter Debye, Albert Einstein, Fritz Haber and Otto Hahn; a board of trustees also provided guidance.

Funding was ultimately obtained from sources internal and external to Germany. Internally, money was raised from individuals, industry and the government, as well as through the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (Emergency Association of German Science).

External to Germany, the Rockefeller Foundation granted students worldwide one-year study stipends for whichever institute they chose. Some studied in Germany, in contrast to the German universities, with their formal independence from state administration, the institutions of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft had no obligation to teach students.

The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and its research facilities were involved in weapons research, experimentation and production in both the First World War and the Second World War. During the World War I, the group, and in particular Fritz Haber, was responsible for introducing the use of poison gas as a weapon. This was in direct violation of established international law.

==The Holocaust==
During World War II, some of the weapons and medical research performed by the KWI was connected to fatal human experimentation on living test subjects (prisoners) in Nazi concentration camps. In fact, members of the KWI of Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, particularly Otmar von Verschuer received preserved Jewish bodies and body parts such as eyes for study and display from Auschwitz. These were provided by his pupil Dr. Josef Mengele from prisoners in his charge. He specialized in examining twins, and their genetic relationship, especially for their eye colour and other personal qualities. As the American forces closed in on the relocated KWI, the organization&#x27;s president, Albert Vögler, an industrialist and early Nazi Party backer, committed suicide, knowing he would be held accountable for the group&#x27;s crimes and complicity in war crimes.

==Post-war==
By the end of the Second World War, the KWG and its institutes had lost their central location in Berlin and were operating in other locations. The KWG was operating out of its Aerodynamics Testing Station in Göttingen. Albert Vögler, the president of the KWG, committed suicide on 14 April 1945. Thereupon, Ernst Telschow assumed the duties until Max Planck could be brought from Magdeburg to Göttingen, which was in the British zone of the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany. Planck assumed the duties on 16 May until a president could be elected. Otto Hahn was selected by directors to be president, but there were a number of difficulties to be overcome. Hahn, being related to nuclear research had been captured by the allied forces of Operation Alsos, and he was still interned at Farm Hall in Britain, under Operation Epsilon. At first, Hahn was reluctant to accept the post, but others prevailed upon him to accept it. Hahn took over the presidency three months after being released and returned to Germany. However, the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) passed a resolution to dissolve the KWG on 11 July 1946.

Meanwhile, members of the British occupation forces, specifically in the Research Branch of the OMGUS, saw the society in a more favourable light and tried to dissuade the Americans from taking such action. The physicist Howard Percy Robertson was director of the department for science in the British Zone; he had a National Research Council Fellowship in the 1920s to study at the Georg August University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Also, Colonel Bertie Blount was on the staff of the British Research Branch, and he had received his doctorate at Göttingen under Walther Borsche. Among other things, Bertie suggested to Hahn to write to Sir Henry Hallett Dale, who had been the president of the Royal Society, which he did. While in Britain, Bertie also spoke with Dale, who came up with a suggestion. Dale believed that it was only the name which conjured up a pejorative picture and suggested that the society be renamed the Max Planck Gesellschaft. On 11 September 1946, the Max Planck Gesellschaft was founded in the British Zone only. The second founding took place on 26 February 1948 for both the American and British occupation zones. The physicists Max von Laue and Walther Gerlach were also instrumental in establishing the society across the allied zones, including the French zone.

<text>Carlos Alfonso Guillén (born September 30, 1975) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball for the Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers.

Guillén was signed by the Houston Astros as a non-draft amateur free agent in 1992. He was traded to the Mariners with pitcher Freddy García and John Halama in the deal that sent Randy Johnson to the Astros. Guillén made his debut in 1998 and was traded to Detroit at the end of the 2003 season. He retired after the 2011 season. In 1,305 games over 14 seasons, Guillén posted a .285 batting average with 124 home runs and 660 RBI.

==Playing career==

===Seattle Mariners===
In Seattle, Guillén was initially forced to play second and third base with incumbent Alex Rodriguez at shortstop. After Alex Rodriguez signed with the Texas Rangers for the season, Guillén moved back to his natural position. He had a league-average campaign in his first full season with the club.

In Game 3 of the 2000 American League Division Series, he hit a squeeze play in the bottom of the ninth inning to score Rickey Henderson and complete the Mariners&#x27; sweep of the Chicago White Sox. In September 2001, Guillén was hospitalized after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, but was ready for the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees the following month.

===Detroit Tigers===
In , Guillén joined a young and restructured Tigers team. In a career year, he led his club in RBI (97), runs (97), doubles (37), triples (10), total bases (283), slugging percentage (.542), OPS (.921), and his .318 batting average was only second to .334 of teammate Iván Rodríguez. Guillén also got his first All-Star berth. However, his breakout season was cut short, as he missed the final month of the 2004 season after tearing his ACL while legging out a triple. He healed well during the 2004 05 offseason and was back to his previous form in time for &#x27;s opening day, although problems with his left hamstring kept him out of the lineup for much of the year.

Guillén returned to elite status in having another outstanding season. His on-base percentage reached .400 for the first time in his career, and he led all Major League shortstops with a .919 OPS. On August 1, 2006, Guillén became the tenth Tiger to hit for the cycle in a game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In 2006, Guillén became the first player in modern Major League history to raise his average for six consecutive seasons, batting .320. In the field, however, he tied for the major league lead in errors at shortstop, with 28. On August 6, 2007, he got his 1,000th hit, knocking in Curtis Granderson with two out in the bottom of the first. Guillen hit a home run in extra innings against the Yankees ending a marathon game that ended at 3:30 AM due to the length of the game and rain delays. On September 30, 2007, on his 32nd birthday, Guillén hit the 93rd home run of his career and it gave him 100 RBIs in a season for the first time in his career.

Due to the acquisition of shortstop Édgar Rentería from the Atlanta Braves during the 2007–2008 offseason, and due to his decreased mobility, Guillén initially moved to first base to start the 2008 season. However, on April 22, manager Jim Leyland announced that Guillén would be moving to third base, with Miguel Cabrera becoming the new starting first baseman. On September 27, 2008, Tigers manager Jim Leyland announced that Guillén would play left field in 2009. Guillén sat out several weeks of the season with a shoulder injury. Jim Leyland announced Guillén would play left field again in 2010 if he stays healthy, but Guillén publicly stated he would prefer to play third base or shortstop. In May 2010, it was announced that Guillén would be the Tigers 2nd baseman after returning from a hamstring injury which he suffered on April 23, replacing rookie Scott Sizemore.

Guillén sat out the first half of 2011 after having microfracture surgery on his left knee in September. He finally returned to play on July 16. Shortly after returning he hit a home run off of Jered Weaver during the July 31, 2011, game vs the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Weaver was upset about Magglio Ordóñez hitting a home run off of him earlier, and quipped to Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera that he was &quot;an asshole&quot; about the situation. Following the home run, Guillén retaliated by &quot;taunting&quot; Weaver by flipping his bat as he started rounding the bases. Weaver was eventually ejected after throwing a high fastball in retaliation at the head of the following batter, Detroit catcher Alex Avila. On October 30, Carlos elected to become a free-agent, ending his tenure with the Tigers. During the weekend of August 4, 2012, the Tigers held a variety events in Guillén&#x27;s honor, which he attended.

===Retirement===
On February 1, 2012, Guillén signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He also received an invitation to spring training. However, he announced his retirement on March 6, 2012, without playing any games for Seattle that spring.

==Personal life==
Guillén has three children with his wife Amelia.

The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hours, headways of up to 15 minutes are operated, with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Lilydale line run in two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Lilydale line opened as early as 1859, with the line fully extended to Lilydale by 1882. The line was built to connect Melbourne and Ringwood with the rural towns of Croydon, Mooroolbark, and Lilydale, among others.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Lilydale line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. Different packages of work have upgraded the corridor to replace sleepers, upgrade signalling technology, introduce new rolling stock, and remove remaining level crossings.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The line from Richmond to Hawthorn was opened initially to a temporary terminus at Pic Nic, just short of the Yarra River, in September 1860, and to Hawthorn in April 1861. It was extended to Camberwell in April 1882, then to Lilydale in early December of that same year. Duplication from East Richmond to Hawthorn occurred less than a month after the Lilydale extension opened. Soon after, the same section was converted to double-line telegraph safeworking, with the section from Hawthorn to Camberwell being converted to Staff and Ticket working.

In May 1885, Hawthorn to Camberwell was duplicated. Duplication was extended to Box Hill in December 1888.

=== 20th century ===
Automatic signalling was introduced in December 1907 with the conversion of the section from East Richmond to Hawthorn to semi-automatic signalling, followed by Richmond to East Richmond being converted to automatic signalling in August 1919. East Richmond to Camberwell was converted in two stages, both in October 1922, and Camberwell to Canterbury the following month. Electrification occurred between Flinders Street and Box Hill in December 1922 and extended to Ringwood the following month, then to Croydon in November 1925, and to Lilydale in October 1925. Conversion to automatic signalling resumed in April 1927 with the conversion of Canterbury to Surrey Hills, followed by Surrey Hills to Box Hill in October 1929.

The section from Croydon to Mooroolbark was duplicated in 1957, creating a long passing loop on this otherwise single-line section beyond Ringwood. The section from Mooroolbark to Lilydale remains a single track. Automatic signalling conversions resumed in July 1958 with the section from Box Hill to Blackburn, followed by Mitcham to Ringwood in September of that year, and Blackburn to Mitcham in November 1960. Hawthorn to Camberwell was triplicated in December 1963, and the triplication was extended to East Camberwell in November 1964. Richmond to Burnley was quadruplicated in 1966–67, and triplication was extended to Box Hill in December 1971, followed by Burnley to Hawthorn in August 1972. This left a short section of double track on the upside of Richmond, but this was quadruplicated with the construction of a flyover in 1973.

Ringwood to Croydon was converted to automatic signalling in November 1973 and duplicated in June 1984. Mooroolbark to Lilydale was converted to automatic signalling in June 1985.

The new Comeng trains were introduced to the Melbourne railway system in 1981. Initially, along with the Lilydale line, they were only allowed to operate on the Alamein, Belgrave, Dandenong and Glen Waverley lines, due to the width of the trains (). The Comeng trains were introduced with the intention of replacing the last of the Tait sets and the majority of the Harris sets. 

=== 21st century ===
A 2007 restructure of train ticketing in Melbourne involved the removal of Zone 3, with Zone 3 stations being re-classified to Zone 2. This brought the cost of train fares down, improving system accessibility to the public.

== Future ==

=== Level Crossing Removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has removed all seven of the remaining level crossings on the Lilydale line, with works completed in stages from 2017 to 2024, making it the first railway line to be entirely level crossing-free in Melbourne. 
Two crossings were removed at Blackburn Road, Blackburn, and Heatherdale Road, Ringwood in 2017, by lowering the rail line under the roads; Heatherdale station was rebuilt. In 2021, two level crossings were removed at Manchester Rd, Mooroolbark, and Maroondah Highway, Lilydale, by building new elevated stations at Mooroolbark and Lilydale which opened on 19 November 2021. In 2023, the level crossings at Union Road and Mont Albert Road were removed by lowering the rail line; Mont Albert and Surrey Hills stations were demolished and permanently closed on 17 February 2023 and a new station built in between, named Union, which opened on 22 May 2023. The last two crossings removed with grade separation involved lowering the rail line below Dublin Road in Ringwood East and elevating it onto a rail bridge above Coolstore Road in Croydon; both Ringwood East station and Croydon station were rebuilt, with Ringwood East station opening on 8 July 2024 while Croydon station opened on 12 August 2024. The final level crossing on the line, Cave Hill Road in Lilydale, was simply closed to car traffic, with an underpass being built for foot traffic, set to open in &quot;spring 2024&quot;.

=== Duplication ===
The &quot;Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail&quot;, released in 2012, highlighted future upgrades for the rail corridor between Mooroolbark and Lilydale. The development plan highlighted the need for the track to be duplicated between Moroolbark and Lilydale as well as the construction of a new train maintenance facility in the Lilydale area within the next 20 years (by 2032). However, this project has not remained on the planning agenda, despite the significant work conducted by the Level Crossing Removal Project in the area, which has previously undertaken duplication works.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Lilydale line operate from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is ~7 minutes on the Ringwood corridor (combined with the Belgrave line) and 10–20 minutes in the AM peak on the Lilydale line, while during non-peak hours, the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Lilydale line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal work, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of work for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

=== Operators ===
The Lilydale line has had a total of six operators since its opening in 1882. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1882 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Hillside Trains, have a combined operational length of 117 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded as Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===
The Lilydale line forms a curved route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Lilydale. The route is long and predominantly double-tracked, however, between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track widens to 12 tracks, narrowing to four tracks between Richmond and Burnley before narrowing to 3 tracks between Burnley and Box Hill. Finally, the line narrows to two tracks between Box Hill and Mooroolbark before narrowing to a single track to its terminus. After Mooroolbark, passing loops and island platforms are present throughout the remaining track to allow trains to pass. Sections of the line have been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. 

The line follows the same alignment as the Alamein, Belgrave, and Glen Waverley lines, with the four services splitting onto different routes at Burnley. The Alamein, Belgrave, and Lilydale services continue till the Alamein line splits off at Camberwell, with the two services continuing together till Ringwood. After departing Ringwood station, the Lilydale line heads north, with the Belgrave line heading in an eastern direction. Almost all of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs, however, the rail line becomes peri-urban towards its terminus in Lilydale.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 27 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop and in Box Hill, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. From 2025, Ringwood East station will be lowered and Croydon station elevated as part of level crossing removal works. 

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===

The Lilydale line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate up to 432 seated passengers in each six car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004, as well as between 2009 and 2020 with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with seven other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003.

Alongside the passenger trains, Lilydale line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===

All stations that are new or rebuilt are fully accessible. Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 59% of Lilydale line stations classified as fully accessible.

=== Signalling ===
The Lilydale line employs a combination of three-position signaling alongside automatic block signaling (ABS) and automatic track control (ATC) safeworking systems, wherein the former involves different signal &#x27;blocks&#x27;, while the latter encompass a variety of mechanisms for enhancing safety and control on the track. Three-position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1919, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling by 1985. Automatic and track controls are used with the centre line between Burnley and Box Hill, and between Mooroolbark and the line&#x27;s terminus in Lilydale.

<doc id="769473" wikidata="Q6431617" url="?curid=769473" title="Korea Defense Service Medal">
<text>The Korea Defense Service Medal (KDSM) is a military service medal of the United States Armed Forces that was first created in 2002 when it was signed into law by President George W. Bush. The bill to create the proposal was introduced and championed by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) and Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). Several designs for the medal were proposed; the selected design was done by John Sproston.

Those awarded the medal are eligible for membership in the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) as well as the American Legion.

==Criteria==
The Korea Defense Service Medal is authorized for those members of the United States Armed Forces who have served duty in South Korea in support of the defense of the South Korean state after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. To qualify for the KDSM, a service member must have served at least thirty consecutive days in the South Korean theater. The medal is also granted for 60 non-consecutive days of service, which includes reservists on annual training in South Korea.

Exceptions are made for the 30/60 days time requirement if a service member participated in a combat armed engagement, was wounded or injured in the line of duty requiring medical evacuation, or participated as a regularly assigned aircrew member in flying sorties which totaled more than 30 days of duty in South Korean airspace. In such cases, the KDSM is authorized regardless of time served in theater.

The Korea Defense Service Medal is retroactive to the end of the Korean War and is granted to any service performed after July 28, 1954. The National Personnel Records Center is responsible for verifying entitlement of the KDSM to discharged members of the military who served in South Korea prior to the creation of the KDSM.

As an official U.S. Department of Defense exception to policy, service members may be entitled to both the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the KDSM for participation in operations in South Korea during the same timeframe between October 1, 1966 and June 30, 1974.

Only one award of the Korea Defense Service Medal is authorized, regardless of the amount of time served in the South Korean theater.

==Appearance==
The Korea Defense Service Medal is a bronze medal in diameter. The obverse bears a Korean &quot;circle dragon&quot;, surrounded by a scroll inscribed &quot;KOREA DEFENSE SERVICE&quot;. In an earlier design of the medal, the scroll is inscribed &quot;KOREA DEFENSE SERVICE MEDAL&quot;. At the base of the medal are two sprigs, laurel on the left and bamboo on the right. The reverse bears an outline of the Korean Peninsula surmounted by two crossed swords, pointed up. Around the edge is a decorative circlet with five points.

The ribbon for the Korea Defense Service Medal is predominantly green and wide. In the center is a ultramarine blue stripe, flanked by stripes of golden yellow and white, spaced apart.

<text>A bolete is a type of mushroom, or fungal fruiting body. It can be identified thanks to a unique cap. On the underside of the cap there is usually a spongy surface with pores, instead of the gills typical of mushrooms. A similar pore surface is found in polypores, but these species generally have a different physical structure from boletes, and have different microscopic characteristics than boletes. Many polypores have much firmer, often woody, flesh.

&quot;Bolete&quot; is the English common name for fungus species with caps that have this appearance.

Some, but not all boletes bruise blue.

== Taxonomy ==
The boletes are classified in the order Boletales. However, not all members of the order Boletales are boletes. The and molecular phylogeny of the order Boletales have established that it also contains many gilled, puffball, and other fruit body shapes. Examples of these fungi include &quot;Chroogomphus&quot;, &quot;Gomphidius&quot;, &quot;Phylloporus&quot;, &quot;Paxillus, Tapinella,&quot; &quot;Hygrophoropsis&quot;, and &quot;Scleroderma.&quot;

The genus &quot;Boletus&quot; was originally broadly defined and described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, containing all pored mushrooms. Since then, gradually other genera have been defined, such as &quot;Tylopilus&quot; by Karsten in 1881, and old names such as &quot;Leccinum&quot; and &quot;Suillus&quot; resurrected or redefined. 

Recently, the genus &quot;Boletus&quot; has been split up even more, creating new genera, such as &quot;Xerocomellus&quot; and &quot;Caloboletus&quot;.

== Ecology ==
Most boletes are mycorrhizal and are generally found in woodlands. There is also a parasitic bolete, &quot;Pseudoboletus parasiticus&quot;, which grows on &quot;Scleroderma citrinum.&quot; Another parasitic bolete is &quot;Buchwaldoboletus lignicola&quot;, which is a parasite to &quot;Phaeolus schweinitzii&quot;, the dyer&#x27;s polypore.

Boletes are susceptible to infection by the fungus &quot;Hypomyces chrysospermus&quot;, also known as the bolete eater.
== Edibility ==
Many boletes, such as the porcini &quot;(Boletus edulis)&quot;, are edible and considered a delicacy. However, other boletes, such as &quot;Suillus&quot; and &quot;Xerocomellus&quot; are considered edible, but not choice. Some boletes, such as &quot;Caloboletus&quot; and &quot;Tylopilus&quot; are too bitter to eat. Other boletes, such as ones in the &quot;Rubroboletus&quot; genus, such as Satan&#x27;s bolete (&quot;Rubroboletus satanas&quot;) are dangerously poisonous. Most poisonous boletes have red pores. Some boletes appear to be hallucinogenic bolete mushrooms. One known bolete species that might be hallucinogenic is &quot;Boletus manicus&quot;.

<doc id="769483" wikidata="Q52468593" url="?curid=769483" title="Belgrave line">
<text>The Belgrave line is a commuter railway line on the Melbourne metropolitan railway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, the line is coloured dark blue and is one of the four lines that constitute the Burnley group. It is the city&#x27;s fourth-longest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Belgrave station in the city&#x27;s east, serving 31 stations via Burnley, Box Hill, Ringwood, and Upper Ferntree Gully. Beyond Belgrave, the narrow-gauge line has been restored as the Puffing Billy Railway, which runs tourist services to the original terminus of Gembrook.

The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hours, headways of up to 15 minutes are operated, with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Belgrave line run in a two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Belgrave line opened as early as 1889, with the line fully extended and re-gauged to Belgrave by 1962. The line was built to connect Melbourne and Ringwood with the rural towns of Bayswater, Boronia, Upper Ferntree Gully, and Belgrave, among others.

Since the 2010s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Belgrave line, significant improvements and upgrades have been made. Different packages of work have upgraded the corridor to replace sleepers, upgraded signalling technology, introduced new rolling stock, and removed seven of the nine remaining level crossings.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

A rail branch was constructed from Ringwood to Upper Ferntree Gully in December 1889. A narrow-gauge line was opened from Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook station in December 1900, the second of four experimental narrow-gauge lines built by the Victorian Railways. These two lines would become joined and standardised to form the Belgrave railway line in the 20th century.

=== 20th century ===
In 1921, the narrow-gauge section from Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave was converted to automatic signalling, the first such instance on single track in the Southern Hemisphere. This section was then reverted to Staff and Ticket safeworking in 1930. Electrification of the railway to Upper Ferntree Gully was implemented in November 1925.

Following a landslide in 1953, the narrow-gauge line was formally closed in April 1954, although services resumed as far as Belgrave for some &quot;farewell specials&quot;, and then for the Puffing Billy Preservation Society until services ceased again in February 1958.

The line was partly duplicated between Bayswater and Lower Ferntree Gully (now Ferntree Gully) in February 1957.

The closing of the narrow-gauge line to Gembrook enabled the first stage of its planned rebuilding to Emerald as part of the suburban electrified system to proceed. This first stage, as far as Belgrave, of the new, broad-gauge, electrified extension opened in February 1962. It initially operated on the Staff and Ticket system but was converted to automatic signalling in March 1964, with the section from Ferntree Gully to Upper Ferntree Gully being converted the following day. Ringwood to Bayswater was converted to automatic signalling in June 1974, as was Bayswater to Ferntree Gully in July 1977. In December 1982, Ringwood -Bayswater was duplicated.

The Comeng trains were introduced to the Melbourne railway system in 1981, alongside the opening of the City Loop. Initially, along with the Belgrave line, they were only allowed to operate on the Alamein, Dandenong, Glen Waverley and Lilydale lines due to the trains 3.05-metre width.

=== 21st century ===
A 2007 restructure of train ticketing in Melbourne involved the removal of Zone 3, with these stations being re-classified to Zone 2. This brought the cost of train fares down, improving system accessibility for the public.

In April 2016, plans to potentially run a regular revenue Tait set service on the Belgrave line was announced. This came following La Trobe MP Jason Wood&#x27;s push for the idea as part of the greater &quot;Puffing Billy master plan&quot;. The Tait service would be aimed at tourists visiting Puffing Billy. In November 2016, $1 million was committed to restoring a Tait set currently stored at the Newport Workshops. The Tait service is expected to originate at Flinders Street station as a direct service to Belgrave bypassing the City Loop.

== Future ==

=== Level Crossing Removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project has announced the removal of seven level crossings between the city and Ferntree Gully station, to be completed in stages from 2016 to 2025. In 2016, two level crossings were removed at Mountain Highway and Scoresby Road, Bayswater, through lowering the rail line under the road. These two removals also included a rebuilt Bayswater station and upgraded stabling facilities. A further two crossings were removed at Blackburn Road, Blackburn, and Heatherdale Road, Ringwood in January 2017. Both of these removals also involved lowering the rail line under the road, with a rebuilt Heatherdale station built as part of the project. Union and Mont Albert Roads were also been removed by lowering the rail line in May 2023. The removals also included closing Mont Albert and Surrey Hills stations, with a new station built in-between called &quot;Union.&quot; The final crossing to be removed on the corridor was at Bedford Road in Ringwood by also lowering the rail line, completed in March 2024. At the conclusion of these removals, only two crossings remain, both between Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully stations.

== Network and operations ==
=== Services ===
Services on the Belgrave line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is ~7 minutes on the Ringwood corridor (combined with the Lilydale line) and 15 minutes in the AM peak on the Belgrave Line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. During certain periods of the day, services operate as a shuttle to Ringwood due to lower demand. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Belgrave line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===
The Belgrave line has had a total of 6 operators since its opening in 1889. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1889 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 110 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===
The Belgrave line forms a mostly curved route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Belgrave. The route is long and predominantly double-tracked, however, between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 4 tracks between Richmond and Burnley before narrowing to 3 tracks between Burnley and Box Hill. Finally, the line narrows to two tracks between Box Hill and Ferntree Gully before narrowing to a single track to its terminus. After Ferntree Gully, passing loops and island platforms are present at Upper Ferntree Gully, Upwey, and Belgrave. After departing from its terminus at Flinders Street, the Belgrave line traverses both flat and hilly country, with some curves (more towards the end of the line) and fairly significant earthworks for parts of the line. Sections of the line have been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite some removals, there are a small number of level crossings still present, with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as the Alamein, Glen Waverley, and Lilydale lines, with the four services splitting onto different routes at Burnley. The Alamein, Belgrave, and Lilydale services continue till the Alamein line splits off at Camberwell, with the two services continuing together till Ringwood. After departing Ringwood station, the Belgrave line heads south, with the Lilydale line heading in an eastern direction. Almost all of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs, however, the rail line becomes peri-urban towards its terminus in Belgrave.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 31 stations across the 49-kilometre (30-mile)-long track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present in the City Loop and Box Hill, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals.


== Infrastructure ==
=== Rolling stock ===

The Belgrave line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage, and can accommodate up to 432 seated passengers in each six car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020, with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with 7 other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003.

Alongside the passenger trains, Belgrave line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train, designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives; for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage, designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== All passenger rolling stock ====
=== Accessibility ===

All stations that are new or rebuilt are fully accessible. Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 58% of Belgrave line stations classified as fully accessible.

=== Signalling ===
The Belgrave line uses three-position signalling with automatic block signalling (ABS) and automatic and track control (ATC) safeworking systems. Three position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1919, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling by 1960. Automatic and track control are used with the centre line between Burnley and Box Hill, and between Ferntree Gully and the line&#x27;s terminus in Belgrave.

<text>The Atbarah River (; transliterated: Nahr &#x27;Atbarah), also referred to as the Red Nile and / or Black Nile, is a river in northeast Africa. It rises in northwest Ethiopia, approximately 50 km north of Lake Tana and 30 km west of Gondar. It then flows about 805 km (500 mi) to the Nile in north-central Sudan, joining it at the city of Atbarah (). The river&#x27;s tributary, the Tekezé (Setit) River, is perhaps the true upper course of the Atbarah, as the Tekezé follows the longer course prior to the confluence of the two rivers (at 14° 10&#x27; N, 36° E) in northeastern Sudan. The Atbarah is the last tributary of the Nile before it reaches the Mediterranean.

For much of the year, it is little more than a stream. However, during the rainy season (generally July to October), the Atbarah rises some 18 ft (5 m) above its normal level. At this time, it forms a formidable barrier between the northern and central districts of the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Besides the Tekezé, other important tributaries of the Atbarah include the Shinfa River which rises west of Lake Tana, and the Greater Angereb which has its source north of the city of Gondar.

== History ==
The earliest surviving mention of the Atbarah is by Strabo (16.4.8), who called the river &quot;Astaboras&quot; (). Other ancient authors mentioning the name include Agatharchides, who called it &quot;Astabaras&quot; (), and Ptolemy (Geography 4.7). Richard Pankhurst and others have argued that the name should be understood as &quot;River of the Boras people&quot;, where &quot;asta&quot; can be related to Proto-Nubian &quot;asti&quot; &quot;water&quot;, while &quot;-boras&quot; can be linked to a number of Roman allusions to a tribe named the Bora (Bera), who lived near Meroe, and another tribe named the &quot;Megabares&quot; ( in Eratosthenes and Strabo, in Pliny the Elder). Pliny the Elder provides a slightly different etymology of Astaboras, stating that &quot;in the language of the local people&quot; the name means &quot;water coming from the shades below&quot; (&quot;N.H.&quot; 5.10).

In April 1898 a major battle was fought beside the river during the Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1896–1899 between Mahdist forces and an Anglo-Egyptian Army under the command of Lord Kitchener, which resulted in the destruction of the 20,000-strong Mahdist detachment.

In 1964, the river was dammed by the Khashm el-Girba Dam near Kassala in Sudan to provide irrigation to the newly built town of Halfa Dughaym in an otherwise fairly arid region and to resettle the Sudanese population driven away by the Aswan High Dam (Sad al-Aali) in Egypt, which flooded 500 km of the Nile Valley in southern Egypt and northern Sudan.

Construction on a $1.9 billion twin dam project about 20 km upstream from the confluence of the Upper Atbara and Setit rivers, the Rumela and Burdana dams, began in 2011 and was inaugurated by President Omar al-Bashir in February 2017.

==Hydrology==
Average monthly flow (1912–1982) of the Atbarah measured approximately 25 km upstream of its mouth, measured in m3/s:

<text>The standard modern rugby union numbering schemes have the starting players numbered from 1 to 15, and the replacements numbered 16 onwards. Rugby union players have not always been identified by individual labels, nor have the systems used always been the same.

==History of the use of numbers on shirts==
The first use of numbered shirts was the match between New Zealand and Queensland at Brisbane, Queensland in 1897 to allow the spectators to identify the players. In that match, New Zealand wore the numbers 1 to 15, starting at fullback, while the hosts wore the numbers 16 to 30.

The practice was adopted for various major internationals, but no definitive system was adopted. The matter was brought before the International Rugby Board by the English and Welsh Rugby Unions in 1921, but it was decided that the identification of players by marking their shirts was a matter to be determined by the team themselves. Most teams used numbers, but in the 1930s, the Welsh used letters. In the early days, a &quot;back row&quot; was truly a back row, with all three players packing down with their shoulders driving the second row (rather than with the flankers driving the props directly as is usual today). Therefore, in many numbering systems these three players were numbered to reflect that (rather than with the two flankers having consecutive numbers as it is today).

Scotland first adopted a numbering system in 1928 for the match against France, but dropped it again immediately. Thus when Scotland played England that year, King George V who attended the game asked why the Scottish players were not numbered, the former president of the Scottish Football Union (as it was then) James Aikman Smith answered, &quot;This, Sir, is a rugby match, not a cattle sale.&quot;

By the 1950s, the Rugby Football Union had produced a booklet called &quot;Know the Game&quot;, in which it is stated that &quot;there are no hard and fast rules governing the names of the positions or the numbers worn&quot;, but it lists the custom in Britain as being 1 for the fullback, to 15 for the lock (now known as the number 8). Rugby league still uses this &quot;correct&quot; numbering system.

A number of different systems are used to publish team lists in newspapers, match programmes and online. In most of the world, players are listed in numerical order, either 1-15 or 15-1. Another common system is to list the backs 15–9, followed by the forwards 1–8, although traditionalists prefer 15–9, 1–5, 6,8,7, i.e. the forwards in scrum order.

By 1950, all the home nations used numbers; England, Scotland and Wales used the system described above, while France and Ireland did the reverse, using what would now be described as the modern system. By the 1960–61 season, however, they had all agreed to use the France/Ireland system, with 1 being loosehead prop and 15 being the fullback.

==Modern numbering==
There is nothing in the &quot;Laws of Rugby Union&quot; that determines if or how players should be individually identified by marking their clothing. However, since 1967, player numbering has been standardised by World Rugby for international matches (1–15, with 1 being loosehead prop and 15 being the fullback; the replacements are then numbered from 16 onwards, with the forwards first from the front row to the number eight, followed by the backs from scrum-half to full-back). English Premiership sides have also adopted this standard numbering system to better aid the understanding of spectators new to the sport, necessitating that Leicester abandon their traditional lettering system, though they have attempted to keep the tradition alive by printing a small letter appropriate to the player&#x27;s position next to the club badge on the left breast.

In South Africa, the blindside flanker wears 7 and openside flanker wears 6.

==Numbering in rugby sevens==
In rugby sevens, although World Rugby requires that players wear numbers, it does not dictate a specific scheme tied to the player&#x27;s position. Accordingly, most teams use permanent squad numbering, although numbering generally starts with the forwards.

==Exceptional systems==
Traditionally, some clubs (notably Leicester Tigers and Bristol) have used alternative schemes consisting of letters, Bath and Richmond have used a scheme without a number 13. Other common variations in the numbering are the interchange of 6 and 7 (particularly in South Africa and Argentina) or of 11 and 14.

Other exceptions include:
* West Hartlepool RFC hung up their No. 5 jersey in memory of their lock John How who died of a heart condition in a 1994 league match. 
* Waitete Rugby Club (affiliated to the King Country Rugby Football Union in New Zealand) retired the number 5 jersey and replaced it with 55, in honour of legendary club and national rugby hero All Black Colin Meads.
* The rugby team of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, which used to use a system of ancient Thai numbers, making identification by opposing teams virtually impossible. 
* Will Greenwood, who normally played at inside centre, preferred to wear the number 13 shirt rather than the usual number 12 assigned to this position for superstitious reasons. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final he played inside centre wearing number 13 and Mike Tindall played outside him in the number 12 shirt.
* Diocesan College, the first school to play rugby in South Africa, has always played without numbers to emphasise that team aspect of the sport. Other South African schools such as Pietermartizburg College in Kwa Zulu Natal province adopted the same approach until recent years when they decided to use player identification numbers likely due to television coverage of matches and referees and officials needing to cite players by number.

<text>Pankrác is a neighborhood of Prague, Czech Republic. It is located south of the city centre on the hills of the eastern bank of the Vltava River and is part of the Prague 4 municipal district, situated in the district of Nusle. Bordering districts are Krč on the south and southwest, Podolí on the west, Vyšehrad on the north and Michle on the east.

The name derives from the local baroque initially very old church of St Pancras (&quot;Pankrác&quot; in Czech), which is filial to the parish church of St. Wenceslas in Nusle. Pankrác is also a synonym for its prison, which lies within its borders.

Since the 1970s, several high-rise commercial buildings have been built in Pankrác Plain, and still others are being discussed amid some criticism that the skyline may threaten the historical character of Prague. Near the high-rise buildings is Centrální park (Central Park) with 4,8 ha, which is a place for recreation.

<doc id="769500" wikidata="Q466963" url="?curid=769500" title="Tetsuko Kuroyanagi">
<text>is a Japanese actress, television personality, World Wide Fund for Nature advisor, and Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. She joined NHK Broadcasting Theatre Company as the first television actress in 1953. In 1954, she made her debut as the lead actress in the radio drama &quot;Yambō Nimbō Tombō&quot;. In 1976, TV Asahi&#x27;s started airing. This program was recognized by the Guinness World Records in 2011 for having the highest number of broadcasts by the same host. It has been airing on weekdays at noon every week, and as of 2023, it has surpassed 11,000 episodes in its 48th year. Her autobiographical book, Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window, which depicts her childhood, became a post-WW2 bestseller with over 8 million copies sold in Japan and 25 million copies worldwide. It has also been adapted into a television series twice.

She is also known for her charitable works, and is considered one of the first Japanese celebrities to achieve international recognition. In 2006, Donald Richie referred to Kuroyanagi in his book &quot;Japanese Portraits: Pictures of Different People&quot; as &quot;the most popular and admired woman in Japan.&quot;

== Early life ==
Kuroyanagi was born in Tokyo City, Tokyo Prefecture (now Tokyo). Her father was a violinist and a concertmaster. Her nickname as a child was Totto-chan, according to her 1981 autobiographical memoir.

==Education ==
Kuroyanagi studied at the Tokyo College of Music, majoring in opera, as she intended to become an opera singer. After graduation, however, she was drawn to acting and the television entertainment industry by her joining Tokyo Hoso Gekidan. Subsequently, she became the first Japanese actress who was contracted to Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK).

== Career ==

After voicing Lady Penelope in the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; TV series, Kuroyanagi first became well known in 1975 when she established her afternoon television program , which was the first talk show on Japanese television. The show was broadcast by the private television channel TV Asahi, and featured Kuroyanagi&#x27;s discussions with celebrities from various fields, including television, sport and politics. Tetsuko&#x27;s Room was very successful, and Kuroyanagi started to be referred to as a &quot;phenomenon&quot; in Japan, in contradiction to the image of &quot;servile&quot; and &quot;wifely&quot; women on Japanese television&quot;. Statistics show that, by the early 1990s, Kuroyanagi had interviewed over two thousand Japanese and foreign guests. It is acknowledged that her warmness as an interviewer and skilled art of talking is a factor that made the TV program live long. She is also familiar to Japanese audiences with her regular appearance on the television quiz show &quot;World Mysteries&quot;.

1981 marked a turning point in her career, as Kuroyanagi published her children book &quot;Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window&quot;, in which Kuroyanagi wrote about the values of the unconventional education that she received at Tomoe Gakuen elementary school during World War II, and her teacher Sosaku Kobayashi. The book is considered her childhood memoir, and upon release, it became the bestselling book in Japanese history. The book was first translated to English in 1984 by Dorothy Britton, and it was published in more than 30 countries.

== Charitable works ==

Kuroyanagi is known internationally for her charitable and fund raising works. She founded the Totto Foundation, named for the eponymous and autobiographical protagonist of her book &quot;Totto-chan, the Little Girl at the Window&quot;. The Foundation professionally trains deaf actors, implementing Kuroyanagi&#x27;s vision of bringing theater to the deaf.

In 1984, in recognition of her charitable works, Kuroyanagi was appointed to be a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, being the first person from Asia to hold this position. During the late 1980s and the 1990s, she visited many developing countries in Asia and Africa for charitable works and goodwill missions, helping children who had suffered from disasters and war as well as raising international awareness of the situations of children in poor countries. Her visit to Angola in 1989 was the first recorded VIP visit from Japan to this country, and marked a milestone for the diplomatic relation between Japan and Angola. Kuroyanagi has raised more than $20 million for the UNICEF programmes that she has been involved in, through television fund-raising campaigns. She also used the royalties from her bestselling book, Totto-chan, to contribute to UNICEF. Kuroyanagi also participated in the international UNICEF ‘Say Yes for Children’ campaign, along with other celebrities.

In 1997, Kuroyanagi published the book &quot;Totto-chan&#x27;s Children&quot;, which was based on her experience working for as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador from 1984 to 1996. Kuroyanagi is a director of the Japanese branch of the World Wildlife Fund.

Kuroyanagi has twice brought America&#x27;s National Theater of the Deaf to Japan, acting with them in sign language.

== Honours ==
For her involvement in media and television entertainment, Kuroyanagi won the Japanese Cultural Broadcasting Award, which is the highest television honour in Japan. Since then, she has been voted 14 times as Japan’s favourite television personality, for the show Tetsuko’s Room.

In 2000, Kuroyanagi became the first recipient of the Global Leadership for Children Award, which was established by UNICEF in the 10th anniversary of the 1990 World Summit for Children. In May 2003, Kuroyanagi received Order of the Sacred Treasure in recognition of her two decades of service for the world’s children.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, a scale parameter is a special kind of numerical parameter of a parametric family of probability distributions. The larger the scale parameter, the more spread out the distribution.

==Definition==
If a family of probability distributions is such that there is a parameter &quot;s&quot; (and other parameters &quot;θ&quot;) for which the cumulative distribution function satisfies

:formula_1

then &quot;s&quot; is called a scale parameter, since its value determines the &quot;scale&quot; or statistical dispersion of the probability distribution. If &quot;s&quot; is large, then the distribution will be more spread out; if &quot;s&quot; is small then it will be more concentrated.


If the probability density exists for all values of the complete parameter set, then the density (as a function of the scale parameter only) satisfies
:formula_2
where &quot;f&quot; is the density of a standardized version of the density, i.e. formula_3.

An estimator of a scale parameter is called an estimator of scale.

===Families with Location Parameters===
In the case where a parametrized family has a location parameter, a slightly different definition is often used as follows. If we denote the location parameter by formula_4, and the scale parameter by formula_5, then we require that formula_6 where formula_7 is the cmd for the parametrized family. This modification is necessary in order for the standard deviation of a non-central Gaussian to be a scale parameter, since otherwise the mean would change when we rescale formula_8. However, this alternative definition is not consistently used.

===Simple manipulations===
We can write formula_9 in terms of formula_10, as follows:

:formula_11

Because &quot;f&quot; is a probability density function, it integrates to unity:

:formula_12

By the substitution rule of integral calculus, we then have

:formula_13

So formula_9 is also properly normalized.

==Rate parameter==
Some families of distributions use a rate parameter (or inverse scale parameter), which is simply the reciprocal of the &quot;scale parameter&quot;. So for example the exponential distribution with scale parameter β and probability density 
:formula_15
could equivalently be written with rate parameter λ as
:formula_16

==Examples==
* The uniform distribution can be parameterized with a location parameter of formula_17 and a scale parameter formula_18.
* The normal distribution has two parameters: a location parameter formula_19 and a scale parameter formula_20. In practice the normal distribution is often parameterized in terms of the &quot;squared&quot; scale formula_21, which corresponds to the variance of the distribution.
* The gamma distribution is usually parameterized in terms of a scale parameter formula_22 or its inverse.
* Special cases of distributions where the scale parameter equals unity may be called &quot;standard&quot; under certain conditions. For example, if the location parameter equals zero and the scale parameter equals one, the normal distribution is known as the &quot;standard&quot; normal distribution, and the Cauchy distribution as the &quot;standard&quot; Cauchy distribution.

==Estimation==
A statistic can be used to estimate a scale parameter so long as it:
* Is location-invariant,
* Scales linearly with the scale parameter, and
* Converges as the sample size grows.
Various measures of statistical dispersion satisfy these. 
In order to make the statistic a consistent estimator for the scale parameter, one must in general multiply the statistic by a constant scale factor. This scale factor is defined as the theoretical value of the value obtained by dividing the required scale parameter by the asymptotic value of the statistic. Note that the scale factor depends on the distribution in question.

For instance, in order to use the median absolute deviation (MAD) to estimate the standard deviation of the normal distribution, one must multiply it by the factor
:formula_23
where Φ−1 is the quantile function (inverse of the cumulative distribution function) for the standard normal distribution. (See MAD for details.) 
That is, the MAD is not a consistent estimator for the standard deviation of a normal distribution, but 1.4826... MAD is a consistent estimator. 
Similarly, the average absolute deviation needs to be multiplied by approximately 1.2533 to be a consistent estimator for standard deviation. Different factors would be required to estimate the standard deviation if the population did not follow a normal distribution.

<text>World Game, sometimes called the World Peace Game, is an educational simulation developed by Buckminster Fuller in 1961 to help create solutions to overpopulation and the uneven distribution of global resources. This alternative to war games uses Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion map and requires a group of players to cooperatively solve a set of metaphorical scenarios, thus challenging the dominant nation-state perspective with a more holistic &quot;total world&quot; view. The idea was to &quot;make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone,&quot; thus increasing the quality of life for all people.

==History and use==
Fuller first publicly proposed the concept in 1967 as the core curriculum at the (then new) Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in reaction to extensive news coverage of the Pentagon&#x27;s war games. He founded there, together with its then executive director John McHale, the World Resources Inventory, an institute responsible for conducting the research required for the game launch. In 1964, Fuller had proposed to hold a session of the World Game in the U.S. pavilion (later known as the Montreal Biosphere) at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, but the project was eventually rejected.

In a preamble to World Game documents for the curriculum released in 1971, Fuller identified it very closely with his &#x27;Guinea Pig &#x27;B&#x27; experiment&#x27; and his &#x27;Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science&#x27; lifework. He claimed intellectual property rights as well to control what he considered to be misapplication of his idea by others. He also claimed he had been playing it &#x27;longhand&#x27; without the assistance of computers since 1927. Nevertheless, Fuller&#x27;s proposal imagined &quot;a vast computerized network that could process, map, and visualize environmental information drawn from, among other sources, Russian and American spy satellites. Fuller claimed that their optical sensors and thermographic scanners could detect the location and quantity of water, grain, metals, livestock, human populations, or any other conceivable form of energy.&quot; The Game would, according to Fuller, transcend human perception&#x27;s limits in the electromagnetic spectrum, and allow a rich dataset of global environmental trends.

Over fifty hours from June 12 to July 31, 1969, Fuller and 27 grad students from a variety of disciplines met on the court of the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, to play the first instance of the World Game, the goal being to end energy poverty by giving all the world population 2000 gigawatt-hours per person per year by 1980; the final strategy revolved around constructing more hydropower. Footage was captured by Herbert Matter for the documentary &quot;The World Game&quot;.

In 1972, the World Game Institute was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Fuller, Medard Gabel, Howard J. Brown and others.

In 1980, the World Game Institute and the World Resources Inventory published the World Energy Data Sheet. The World Energy Data Sheet compiled a nation by nation summary of energy production, resources, and consumption. The information was compiled in tables and map formats. The project was researched by Seth Snyder and overseen by Medard Gabel. The work was used during a World Game in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1980.

By 1993, the World Game Institute developed and sold an educational software package called Global Recall, which contained global data, maps, an encyclopedia of world problems, and tools for developing solutions to world problems. The package was a computer-based simulation game intended for use by high school and college students in learning about world problems and how to solve them.

In 2001, a for-profit educational company named o.s. Earth Inc. purchased the principal assets of the World Game Institute and offered a Global Simulation Workshop that is a &#x27;direct descendant of Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s famous World Game.&#x27; In 2019, the company transferred its assets to the Schumacher Center for New Economics.

In 2021, Gabel&#x27;s new organization, the Global Solutions Lab, announced their own revamp of the World Game, titled &quot;WorldGame 2.0&quot;.

==Format==
Organizers of a World Game session have a large amount of discretion over the format. The original 1969 workshop version ran for at least fifty hours from June 12 to July 31, and involved 28 people including Fuller. However, versions of the World Game exist with durations ranging from as long as an academic semester (e.g. the 1967 Southern Illinois University curriculum), to one day (as offered by the group We R One World), to four to six hours (as carried out by the University of California, San Diego in 1995, to mark the centenary of Fuller&#x27;s birth) to as short as four hours (as offered by the Global Solutions Lab), and with total player amounts ranging from 15 to hundreds.

The Southern Illinois University curriculum, written by Fuller, does not describe its procedures as rules, but rather as &quot;rudimentary&quot; guidelines. Each World Game session has an overarching goal, from ending energy poverty (the original workshop&#x27;s goal, met by allowing each person on Earth 2 gigawatt-hours per year through increased hydropower), to improving transportation, to ending world hunger, ending illiteracy, building world peace, and solving climate change. Players adopt &#x27;handicaps&#x27; tied to the session goal as necessary; for example, the UCSD session involved the representatives of regions with the lowest literacy rates being barred from speaking or asking questions. All players must work together, ostensibly as one common team (though organizers often opt to split them into smaller teams), to develop strategies for meeting this goal using the latest data, preferably in as short a time or as efficiently as possible—an analogous board game format would be cooperative gameplay, while an analogous video game format would be cooperative within real-time strategy setting. The end product is left vague in Fuller&#x27;s document, but might take the form of a written report.

Fuller proposed one model for how the World Game would be played farther in the future: after a week of studying a given problem, the players would partake in three rounds of peer review and negotiations. Colleague Medard Gabel described Fuller&#x27;s vision as follows, using the example of world hunger:
The company o.s. Earth, which held the intellectual property for the licensed World Game version, formatted its 2000s sessions thusly: 10 teams of randomly selected players representing each region of the world were obligated to form negotiation strategies for the sake of their &#x27;constituents&#x27;, the people, with the aim of meeting five smaller objectives in human rights, technology, environment, education and health and food. There were also eight teams representing facilitators: four role-played executives of fictional for-profit mega-corporations as stand-ins for the private sectors of some regions, while four represented analogs of the World Health Organization, UNESCO, UN Environment Programme, and UN Commission on Human Rights that &#x27;sold&#x27; strategies. The remaining two teams represented the United Nations&#x27; principal organs and aid programs, and the world&#x27;s news media, which would report live on the Game&#x27;s progress. Most of the action in the game centered on three 20-minute rounds of trade negotiations to ensure that all teams&#x27; needs were met, with a few dozen minutes at the end set aside for reflection. The timespan simulated was thirty years. Points were scored based on the sum of solutions cards and currency, with very high-development regions such as Europe, Northern America and Japan starting out at about 110-140 points.

==Resources==
A universal feature of all World Game sessions is the use of an extremely large Dymaxion map of the world, typically within a 70-foot-by-35-foot rectangle on a surface such as a basketball court.
This projection is intended to depict the world&#x27;s landmasses and population without reinforcing cultural perceptions of the Global North and Global South divide, and while balancing accurate representation of landmass shapes with that of land areas.

Players of the World Game are usually given huge collections of data in the form of documents from the United Nations, world atlases, and the organizers (in the Southern Illinois University curriculum, from Fuller&#x27;s own &quot;World Design Science Decade&quot; series). These documents can list data ranging from material inputs, production numbers and inventory sizes, to population sizes, numbers of important institutions such as news outlets, and other such statistics as needed, but will almost always include policy menus, time series and trend forecasts as close to real-time as possible to ensure adjustment of each strategy. Some documents are hosted on specialized software that allows users to review plans in &#x27;breakout rooms&#x27;, as in the most comprehensive version of &quot;WorldGame 2.0&quot;. 

In the o.s. Earth version, the teams were first given multimedia content including PowerPoint presentations. Then they were given cards that depicted solutions signifying advancements in health, education, technology, environment, or human rights. They were obliged to negotiate with mega-corporation and UN analogues for these cards, which could be purchased with oversized poker chips representing large amounts of money; these were fitted into plastic trays. Lastly, they could stick the cards into folders representing development levels. Earlier sessions saw players select a team out of the 20 total by taking a badge and labeled hat, while in later sessions the players were randomly assigned.

==Reception==
In 1995, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Tony Perry covered the UCSD session, and lightheartedly compared it to the board game Monopoly. He also noted Gabel&#x27;s role in expanding the World Game into the area of briefing corporate clients.

In 2021, arts professor Timothy Stott published a book titled &quot;Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s World Game and its Legacy&quot;, which analyzed the World Game and its history. He found that there were extensive contrasts between its purported stateless, cosmopolitan approach to world problems and its conception during the height of 1960s U.S. technological and cultural hegemony, as well as tensions between its apolitical, anarchic aspirations and technocratic character. He also found that participants often failed to grasp and manipulate the complex systems of the game.

<text>The ducat () coin was used as a trade coin in Europe from the later Middle Ages to the 19th century. Its most familiar version, the gold ducat or sequin containing around of 98.6% fine gold, originated in Venice in 1284 and gained wide international acceptance over the centuries. Similarly named silver ducatons also existed. The gold ducat circulated along with the Florentine florin and preceded the modern British pound sterling.

==Predecessors==
The word &quot;ducat&quot; is from Medieval Latin &quot;ducalis&quot; = &quot;relating to a duke (or dukedom)&quot;, and initially meant &quot;duke&#x27;s coin&quot; or a &quot;duchy&#x27;s coin&quot;.

The first issue of scyphate billon coins modelled on Byzantine &quot;trachea&quot; was made by King Roger II of Sicily as part of the Assizes of Ariano (1140). It was to be a valid issue for the whole kingdom. The first issue bears the figure of Christ and the Latin inscription &quot;Sit tibi, Christe, datus, quem tu regis iste ducatus&quot; (meaning &quot;O Christ, let this duchy, which you rule, be dedicated to you&quot;) on the obverse. On the reverse, Roger II is depicted in the style of a Byzantine emperor and his eldest son, Duke Roger III of Apulia, is depicted in battle dress. The coin took its common name from the Duchy of Apulia, which the younger Roger had been given by his father.

Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice introduced a silver ducat which was related to the ducats of Roger II. Later gold ducats of Venice, however, became so important that the name ducat was associated exclusively with them and the silver coins came to be called grossi.
==Gold ducat of Venice==
In the 13th century, the Venetians imported goods from the East and sold them at a profit north of the Alps. They paid for these goods with Byzantine gold , but when the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos backed the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, he debased the . This was just one more in a series of debasements of the , and the Great Council of Venice responded with its own coin of pure gold in 1284.

In 1252 Florence and Genoa introduced the gold florin and genovino, respectively, both of 3.5 grams of 98.6% fine gold; the florin preceded the ducat as Western Europe&#x27;s first standard gold coin. Venice modeled the size and weight of their ducat on the florin, with a slight increase in weight due to differences in the two cities′ weight systems. The Venetian ducat contained 3.545 grams of 99.47% fine gold, the highest purity medieval metallurgy could produce.

Venetian ducat designs followed those of the silver grossi, which were ultimately of Byzantine origin. The obverse shows the Doge of Venice kneeling before St. Mark, the patron saint of Venice. Saint Mark holds the gospel, which is his usual attribute, and presents a gonfalone to the doge. The legend on the left identifies the saint as S M VENET, i.e. Saint Mark of Venice, and the legend on the right identifies the doge, with his title DVX in the field. On the reverse, Christ stands among a field of stars in an oval frame. The reverse legend is the same as on Roger II’s ducats.

Succeeding doges of Venice continued striking ducats, changing only their name on the obverse. The ducat had a variable price versus the silver Venetian lira, reaching 6.2 &quot;lire&quot; or 124 &quot;soldi&quot; (shillings) by 1470. At that point a ducat worth 124 soldi emerged as a new silver-based unit of account for quoting salaries and costs. Continued depreciation in the silver currency during the 16th century, however, made the gold ducat worth more than 124 soldi. At this point, the currency ducat of 124 soldi had to be distinguished from the higher-valued gold ducat, and the latter was eventually called the &quot;ducato de zecca&quot;, i.e. ducat of the mint, which was shortened to &quot;zecchino&quot; and corrupted to &quot;sequin&quot;.

Leonardo Loredan extended the coinage with a half ducat and subsequent doges added a quarter, and various multiples up to 105 ducats. All of these coins continued to use the designs and weight standards of the original 1284 ducat. Even after dates became a common feature of western coinage, Venice struck ducats without them until Napoleon ended the Venetian Republic in 1797.

==Adoption, 14th century==
When the Roman Senate introduced gold coinage either the florin or the ducat could have provided an advantageous model to imitate, but the Florentines who controlled the Senate’s finances ensured that their city’s coin was not copied. Instead, the Roman coin showed a senator kneeling before St. Peter on the obverse and Christ amid stars in oval frame on the reverse in direct imitation of the Venetian ducat. The Popes subsequently changed these designs, but continued to strike ducats of the same weight and size into the 16th century.

Most imitations of the Venetian ducat were made in the Levant, where Venice spent more money than it received. The Knights of Saint John struck ducats with grand master Dieudonné de Gozon, 1346-1353, kneeling before Saint John on the obverse and an angel seated on the Sepulcher of Christ on the reverse. Subsequent grand masters, however, found it expedient to copy the Venetian types more exactly, first at Rhodes and then on Malta. Genoese traders went further; they struck ducats at Chios that could be distinguished from the Venetian originals only by their workmanship. These debased ducats were problematic for Venice, which valued its money&#x27;s reputation for purity. The rarity of ducats that Genoese traders struck at Mytilene, Phocaea, and Pera suggests that Venetians melted those they encountered.

==Hungarian ducats==

In Western Europe, Venice was an active trader but they sold more than they bought, thus giving the Florentine florin an early foothold in the Rhine river valley in 1354. However, this Rhenish florin or &quot;gulden&quot; was debased over the centuries, from 3.43 g fine gold in 1354, to 2.76 g fine gold by 1419, and to 2.503 g fine gold by 1559.

After Henckels assassinated Amadeus Aba in 1311, Charles I of Hungary began a gold coinage exploiting ores of Aba&#x27;s ancient gold mines. His son, Louis I of Hungary changed the designs by replacing the standing figure of Saint John from the florin with a standing figure of Saint Ladislaus and later changing the lily of Florence to his coat of arms, but he maintained the purity of the gold.

In light of the 15th century debasement of the Rhenish florin or goldgulden versus the original ducat, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V recognized this distinction in 1524 when he made ducats of the Venetian standard valid money in the Empire with a value 39% higher than the gulden. His younger brother and eventual successor, Ferdinand I, brought this system to Hungary in 1526, when he inherited its throne. The still-pure gold coins of Hungary were henceforth called ducats. Their purity made the Hungarian ducat acceptable throughout Europe. Even the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland left records of the ones his king used for gambling.

Hungary continued to strike ducats with 3.53133 grams of 98.6% fine gold. Unlike the unchanging designs of the ducats in Venice, the coat of arms on the reverse of the ducats of Hungary was frequently modified to reflect changed circumstances. In 1470, Matthias Corvinus replaced the coat of arms by a Madonna. Hungary struck ducats until 1915, even under Austrian rule. These were used as trade coins and several of the later dates have been restruck.
==Adoption, 15th and 16th centuries==

In the 15th and 16th centuries, international traders in Western Europe shifted from the florin to the ducat as their preferred currency, with ducats often co-circulating with locally minted gold coins like the Rhenish guilder, French &quot;écu&quot; and Spanish &quot;escudo&quot;.

As rulers reformed their currencies, they frequently used the ducat as a model. The Mamluk &quot;ashrafi&quot; and the Ottoman &quot;sultani&quot; are examples.
In 1497, Spain reformed its gold into a copy of the ducat which was known as the from 1504. 23¾ carats fine and slightly smaller than the Venetian ducat, each had about 3.484 g of pure gold and was reckoned as 375 maravedís, the typical unit of account at the time. The Holy Roman Emperor MaximilianI initiated his own currency reform, minting gold ducats in Austria from 1511. Gold ducats and florins were established through the rest of the Holy Roman Empire by minting ordinances () in 1524, 1559, and later. The ducat weighed 3.49 grams and was 23⅔ carats fine (3.442 g of pure gold) and exchanged at a ratio of 8 ducats for 11 Rhenish florins, which weighed 3.25 grams and were 18½ carats fine (2.503 g of pure gold). The German territories retained these standards until the 19th century.

==Ducats of the Netherlands==
The Dutch Revolt gave its seven northern provinces control of their coinage. The collapse of the government of Francis of Anjou in 1583, however, left them without a constitutional ruler to name on those coins. They fell back on the longstanding regional tradition of imitating well accepted foreign coins. In this case they avoided political complications by copying obsolete coins. The gold coins Ferdinand and Isabella issued to the standards of the ducat were widely copied and called ducats. They also imitated the Hungarian ducat and those coins had more influence on the subsequent coinage of the United Provinces. Since the Netherlands became a dominant international trader, the influence of these ducats was global.
At first, ducats of Hungarian type struck in the Netherlands had a standing figure on the obverse with the crown and battle axe that St. Ladislaus carried on the Hungarian prototype, but naming him with a different legend. Like the original, but not contemporary, Hungarian ducats, the reverse had a shield, which now showed the coat of arms of the issuing province These types evolved into a standing knight holding a sword and seven arrows representing the seven provinces in the union. The legend, CONCORDIA RES PARVÆ CRESCUNT, shortened in a variation of ways, says &quot;by concord small things increase&quot;. It also names—or shows a symbol representing—the province that issued the coin. The reverse had a tablet inscribed and always shortened in the same way: MOneta ORDInum PROVINciarum FOEDERatorum BELGicarum AD LEGem IMPerii, gold money of the federated provinces of Belgium in accordance with the law of the realm. In the Napoleonic period, the Batavian Republic and Louis Bonaparte continued to strike ducats with these designs. These coins were not issued during the annexation of the Netherlands into the French Empire. Since Napoleon’s defeat, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has continued to issue them as trade and bullion coins. The text in the table on the reverse now says MOneta AURea REGni BELGII AD LEGEM IMPERII.

==Silver ducaton==

The silver ducaton commenced in the Italian states in the mid-16th century as a large coin of approximately 30 grams fine silver, worth slightly less than the gold ducat or sequin.

Similarly-named coins were also minted in the Low Countries in the 17th and 18th centuries, which became popular &quot;negotiepenningen&quot; (trade coins) along with gold ducats: the Spanish Netherlands ducaton in 1618 of 30.7 g fine silver, the Dutch Republic&#x27;s silver rider ducaton in 1659 of 30.45 g fine silver, and (confusingly) the Dutch Republic&#x27;s smaller &quot;zilveren dukaat&quot; (silver ducat) in 1659 of 24.36 g fine silver.

==Decline==
Use of the ducat waned from the 17th century with the minting of freshly-mined Latin American gold to Iberian standards like the Spanish doubloon and the Portuguese &quot;moidore&quot;. In the 19th century ducats were progressively dropped as standard coin of several nations, most significantly the Latin Monetary Union of 1865 (France, Italy, Switzerland) and the Vienna Monetary Treaty of 1857 (German Confederation, Austria-Hungary). By the 20th century ducats have transitioned from trade coin used in daily commerce to bullion coin for collectors and investors.

Austria continued to strike ducats until 1915, and has continued to restrike the last of them, including some four ducat coins illustrated here. Nevertheless, bullion for Spain&#x27;s American colonies allowed the Spanish dollar to supersede the ducat as the dominant currency of world trade.

Around 1913, the gold ducat was worth the equivalent of &quot;nine shillings and four pence sterling, or somewhat more than two dollars. The silver ducat is of about half this value.&quot; Even now some national mints produce batches of ducats made after old patterns as bullion gold and banks sell these coins to private investors or collectors.

<doc id="769516" wikidata="Q1502082" url="?curid=769516" title="Thyrfing">
<text>Thyrfing is a viking metal band from Sweden. The band is named after the royal sword Tyrfing from Norse mythology.

== History ==
Thyrfing was formed in 1995 by Patrik Lindgren (guitar), Jocke Kristensson (drums), Peter Löf (keyboard) and Kimmy Sjölund (bass guitar). Northern mythology and the Viking age was an interest of all the members. After two demo tapes that gained a lot of positive response in the underground scene, Thyrfing signed to the Dutch record label Hammerheart Records in 1997. In Stockholm&#x27;s Sunlight Studio in Stockholm, their debut album was recorded, showing a much more varied songwriting. The album was then released in March 1998. For their second album, this time recorded in the Abyss Studios, their music took on a more symphonic approach. For future live performances, Henke Svegsjö from Winds was recruited on guitar. Once again with Tommy Tägtgren, &quot;Urkraft&quot; was recorded and released in August 2000. During that same year, the band also held two mini-tours with Primordial and Shadowbreed throughout The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

In the autumn of 2001, the band entered Dug-Out Studio with producer Daniel Bergstrand to record &quot;Vansinnesvisor&quot; (). The album was released in July the following year

To support the album, Thyrfing played two gigs during the winter (for Freedom Call and Dismember) in Stockholm, and did a small headliner tour in Benelux with Cruachan and Shadowbreed.

2003 followed with further live-promotion, such as the Generation Armageddon Festivals (including Ancient Rites, Septic Flesh, Primordial, Blood Red Throne and Skyfire), a 12-day European tour throughout Europe, and performances on the main festival stages of 2000 Decibel in Sweden and Wacken Open Air in Germany.

Thyrfing entered EMI studios on 18 April 2005 to record their new album, &quot;Farsotstider&quot; (&quot;Times of Plague&quot;), which was released on 21 November 2005.

The band played their first US show in January 2006 alongside Moonsorrow and Primordial at the Heathen Crusade metalfest in Columbia Heights, Minnesota.

On 13 March 2007, the band posted a message on the official Thyrfing site declaring that Thomas Väänänen (vocals) and Henrik Svegsjö (guitars) had decided to leave the band due to lack of motivation. Instead of Thomas, founder and ex-vocalist of Naglfar, Jens Rydén, is currently handling the vocals. The band also decided to continue with one guitarist.

In October 2008, Thyrfing released their album &quot;Hels vite&quot;.
Their latest album, &quot;Vanagandr&quot; was released 27 August, 2021.

<doc id="769518" wikidata="Q3322334" url="?curid=769518" title="Huron Mountains">
<text>The Huron Mountains are located in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, mostly in Marquette County, and extending into Baraga County, overlooking Lake Superior. Their highest peak is Mount Arvon, which is the highest point in Michigan at above sea level. Nearby Mount Curwood, Michigan&#x27;s second highest mountain at , is also a part of the Huron Mountains.

==Geology==
The mountains are the remnants of much higher peaks, composed of Precambrian rocks which have gone through successive periods of uplift and erosion. The outcroppings of granite and siliceous metamorphic rocks bear the evidence of more recent glacial action. Geologically, the area is part of the Canadian Shield.

Pleistocene glaciation deposited sandy loam or loamy sand glacial till on most of the terrain, and the soils, podzolized in well drained areas, are largely mapped as Munising or Keweenaw series. Loamy or silty mantles atop the till are mapped as Michigamme series, while sandy outwash often is classified as Kalkaska series.

The region is subject to heavy lake-effect snow from Lake Superior. No official weather records are maintained in the mountains, but annual snowfall averages easily exceed across the entire range. Some higher elevations probably average over . The community of Herman receives an unofficial average of per season.

==Ecology==
The region is characterized by its boreal vegetation and unusually diverse and pristine habitats. It includes one of the largest remnants of substantially undisturbed old-growth forest in the upper Great Lakes region. Forests on the uplands are dominated by hemlock and northern hardwoods. Forests on the steep slopes and mountain ridges are dominated by pine-oak stands.

Fauna in the area includes wolves, moose, coyotes, cougar, fisher, marten, mink, white-tailed deer, gray and red foxes, porcupines, black bears, river otters and beavers.

==Conservation==

The area has been preserved largely by the influence of the highly exclusive Huron Mountain Club (HMC) which owns a large tract of land in the mountains, including a portion of the Salmon Trout River. The club commissioned noted naturalist Aldo Leopold to create a preservation plan for the area. The HMC restricts access to its property, limiting whitewater rafting on the Salmon Trout River. The HMC put Henry Ford on a waiting list. In order to gain favor with the club, Ford blocked the construction of a planned extension of highway M-35 through the mountains. After gaining membership, Ford commissioned noted architect Albert Kahn in 1929 to build a $100,000 cabin for his use.

The Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation sponsors natural science research in the region, including the HMC lands. In the late 1950s, the Huron Mountains were a candidate for becoming a national park. However, the HMC was influential in undermining the proposal.

<doc id="769520" wikidata="Q1064905" url="?curid=769520" title="Concentric castle">
<text>A concentric castle is a castle with two or more concentric curtain walls, such that the outer wall is lower than the inner and can be defended from it. The layout was square (at Belvoir and Beaumaris) where the terrain permitted, or an irregular polygon (at Krak and Margat) where curtain walls of a spur castle followed the contours of a hill.

Concentric castles resemble one castle nested inside the other, thus creating an inner and outer ward. They are typically built without a central free-standing keep. Where the castle includes a particularly strong tower (donjon), such as at Krak or Margat, it projects from the inner enceinte.

== Development ==
Surrounding fortresses or towns with a series of defensive walls where the outer walls are lower than the inner walls is something that has been found in fortifications going back thousands of years to cultures like the Assyrians, Persians, Ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. The ancient city of Lachish, a place in Israel, was excavated and found to consist of multiple walls that were illustrated in Assyrian art documenting their successful siege of the city. The Byzantines also famously constructed the Walls of Constantinople, which featured double layers of walls through most of its perimeter and a moat. The city of ancient Babylon also featured multiple layers of fortifications, famously seen in the Ishtar Gate. However, the relationship of the concentric castle to other forms of fortification is complex. An example of an early concentric castle is the Byzantine castle of Korykos in Turkey, built in the early 11th century AD. 

Historians (in particular Hugh Kennedy) have argued that the concentric defence arose as a response to advances in siege technology in the crusader states from the 12th to the 13th century. The outer wall protected the inner one from siege engines, while the inner wall and the projecting towers provided flanking fire from crossbows. Also, the strong towers may have served as platforms for trebuchets for shooting back at the besiegers. The walls typically include towers, arrowslits, and wall-head defences such as crenellation and, in more advanced cases, machicolations, all aimed at an active style of defence. The Krak des Chevaliers in Syria is the best-preserved of the concentric crusader castles. By contrast, Château Pèlerin was &quot;not&quot; a concentric castle, as the side facing the sea did not require defensive walls. However, the two walls facing the land are built on the same defensive principles as other crusader castles in the same period, rivalling the defences at Krak.

While a concentric castle has double walls and towers on all sides, the defences need not be uniform in all directions. There can still be a concentration of defences at a vulnerable point. At Krak des Chevaliers, this is the case at the southern side, where the terrain permits an attacker to deploy siege engines. Also, the gate and posterns are typically strengthened using a bent entrance or flanking towers.

Concentric castles were expensive to build, so that only the powerful military orders, the Hospitallers and Templars, or powerful kings could afford to build and maintain them. It has also been pointed out that the concentric layout suited the requirements of military orders such as the Hospitallers in resembling a monastery and housing a large garrison. Such castles were beyond the means of feudal barons. Thus, concentric castles coexisted with simpler enclosure castles and tower keeps even in the crusader states.

Concentric castles appeared in Europe in the 13th century, with the castles built in Wales by Edward I providing some outstanding examples, in particular Beaumaris Castle, a &quot;perfect concentric castle&quot;, albeit unfinished. As Beaumaris was built on flat terrain rather than a spur, it was both necessary and possible to build walls and towers facing in all directions, giving a very regular, almost square, floor plan to the castle. Some influence from crusader fortification has been conjectured, but the amount of technology transfer from the East and much earlier Byzantine examples remains controversial among historians.

==Similar structures==

In the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire, many castles had double curtain walls with a narrow ward between them, referred to as a . These were added at vulnerable points like the gate but were rarely as fully developed as in the concentric castles in Wales or the Crusader castles.

The principle of an outer and inner wall was also used in fortified cities, such as the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople and the city wall of Carcassonne.

The concept of mutually reinforcing lines of defence with flanking fire was continued in later periods, such as the early modern fortifications of Vauban, where outer defence works were protected and overlooked by others and their capture did not destroy the integrity of the inner Citadel.

Citadels from before and during the Reconquista in Spain and Portugal also have fortifications similar to concentric castles found elsewhere in Europe. Castle of Almodóvar del Río is a good example of such a fortress along with Saint George Castle in Lisbon Portugal.

<text>Hue and Cry are a Scottish pop duo formed in 1983 in Coatbridge, Scotland by the brothers Pat Kane and Greg Kane. The duo are best known for their 1987 single &quot;Labour of Love&quot;.

==Career==
Their first single &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; was released on a small Glasgow-based independent label, Stampede, in 1986. While not a hit, it attracted the interest of Virgin Records&#x27; subsidiary Circa who signed the duo in 1986. Their debut single for Circa was &quot;I Refuse&quot;. Their second single and biggest hit was &quot;Labour of Love&quot; from the debut album &quot;Seduced and Abandoned&quot;. Other hits included &quot;Looking for Linda&quot; and &quot;Violently (Your Words Hit Me)&quot; – both from their second album &quot;Remote&quot;.

In the 1990s, the brothers embarked upon a period of musical experimentation. Their 1991 album &quot;Stars Crash Down&quot; embraced folk, country, Latin and quartet jazz. &quot;Truth and Love&quot; (1992) was released on the brothers&#x27; own short-lived label, Fidelity. Hue and Cry had a brief chart revival in 1993 with the release of the Circa compilation album &quot;Labours of Love – The Best of Hue and Cry&quot;, which included a Joey Negro remix of &quot;Labour of Love&quot;.

1994 saw a collaboration with jazz arranger and composer, Richard Niles. This produced the album &quot;Showtime!&quot; and the single &quot;Just Say You Love Me&quot;. Pat Kane continued to work with Niles sporadically on live concerts for BBC Radio 2 with the BBC Big Band. In 1996 Hue and Cry signed to the Scottish jazz and classical record label, Linn Records, for an intended trilogy of albums. First came &quot;JazzNotJazz&quot;, an album that mixed jazz with non-jazz sounds. The album was recorded in a week during the Glasgow Jazz Festival, enlisting the services of some of the jazz musicians visiting the city. They included Michael Brecker (tenor sax) and Randy Brecker (trumpet) – who had played on the &quot;Remote&quot; album – as well as guitarist Mike Stern (sidesman with Miles Davis), drummer Danny Gottlieb (Pat Metheny) and saxophonist Tommy Smith.

&quot;Next Move&quot; (1999) featured drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, R&amp;B and Nuyorican Latin-funk. The album contained a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sign &#x27;O&#x27; the Times&quot;, which they stripped bare and built up again as an aggressive bebop number. The intended third album on Linn Records was never produced, as the brothers concentrated on their solo projects – Pat with his writing and solo performing, and Greg with his music production.

=== Reformation ===
In April 2005, Hue and Cry made a comeback when they won the fourth-week heat of the ITV1 pop-competition show &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; with a rendition of &quot;Labour of Love&quot; and a cover of Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;. They were beaten in the final by Shakin&#x27; Stevens.
The band followed this up with dates in Scotland, a piano-vocal spot in support of Jamie Cullum at the &#x27;Live on the Lawn&#x27; festival in Aberdeenshire, and a set in front of 25,000 at Glasgow&#x27;s Hogmanay party. Their concerts in 2006 and 2007 sold out. The band performed two nights at the West End festival in Glasgow in 2007, where they showcased piano-vocal versions of new and old songs. They played Retrofest at Culzean Castle on 2 September 2007, and headlined the Darvel Music Festival on 5 October. The duo showcased new tracks at a gig in Edinburgh Voodoo Rooms on 12 July 2008. At this time, the duo allowed fans exclusive access with the Hue and Cry Music Club through the official website.

On 15 September 2008, they released their &quot;Open Soul&quot; album, for which recording and mixing finished in 2007. The first single &quot;The Last Stop&quot; on digital download was released on 1 September and coincided with the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Remote&quot;. Their &#x27;Open Soul&#x27; tour had sold out dates in Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow, London, Manchester and Sheffield, beginning on 11 September 2008. On 1 December, the band released a second single &quot;Heading for a Fall&quot;. They also opened for Al Green on 30 October. They completed a tour of House of Fraser stores and, in February 2009, embarked on another sell out UK tour, billed as &#x27;Open Soul..Open Road&#x27;. On 9 February, EMI released a &#x27;Best of Collection&#x27; and the band released a third single called &quot;Fireball.&quot; The band also launched the Hue and Cry Music Club.

May 2009 saw the band headline the &quot;Burns an&#x27; a&#x27; that&quot; festival in Ayrshire, and play an acoustic set in Aberdeen. In July 2009, the brothers supported Human League at Thetford Forest and, in November 2009, played at &quot;Homecoming Live- The Final Fling&quot;. They released a Christmas album on 30 November 2009 entitled &quot;Xmasday&quot;. Hue and Cry played sold out nights as part of the History City weekend on 18 and 19 December 2009.

A new Hue And Cry album, &quot;Hot Wire&quot; was released on 19 March 2012 to critical acclaim, and the band played acoustic gigs in support of it. They also appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show, and played &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; on the Titanic memorial show for Radio 2 receiving praise from Holland as well as Dermot O&#x27;Leary and Jeremy Vine. They also appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2012.

Hue and Cry appeared on an August 2012 edition of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother, Bit on the Side&quot;, singing &quot;Labour of Love&quot; at the end of the show. A further compilation album, &quot;A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s&quot; was released in 2012. They headed out on the road again in October 2012 with their band to play six shows in Scotland and performed further charity gigs towards the end of the year.

<text>Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI) (pronounced &quot;perry&quot;) is a non-profit astronomical observatory located in the Pisgah National Forest near Balsam Grove, North Carolina. PARI operates multiple radio telescopes and optical telescopes for research and teaching purposes. The observatory is affiliated with the University of North Carolina system through the Pisgah Astronomical Research and Science Educational Center (PARSEC).

==History==
PARI is located at the site of the former Rosman Satellite Tracking Station, which was established by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1962. The site was part of the worldwide Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network and an integral communications link for the crewed space programs Project Gemini and Project Apollo.

The facility was transferred to the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1981. Known as the Rosman Research Station, it was used as a signals intelligence gathering facility. The site was closed by the NSA in 1995 and transferred to the United States Forest Service.

After several years of inactivity, the federal government proposed to dismantle the facility. Recognizing the utility of the site, a small group of interested scientists and businessmen formed a not-for-profit foundation, which acquired the site in January 1999. It has continued capital investment at the facility, enabling updates of the equipment for astronomical observation purposes. A staff of professional astronomers, engineers, and other scientists work at the observatory.

In the early morning hours of Dec 24th, 2012, the institute was burglarized. Its collection of about 100 meteorites, valued at at least $80,000 and with specimens weighing up to , was stolen, along with about $100,000 worth of TVs, monitors, projectors, microscopes, and other scientific equipment. Much of the stolen property, including the meteorite collection, was recovered within a week.

==Research and education==
PARI hosts research and study programs with Furman University, Clemson University, Virginia Tech, South Carolina State University and Duke University. The PARI site has hosted several professional astronomy meetings, including the Small Radio Telescope Conference in August 2001, the Gamma-Ray Bursts Today and Tomorrow Conference in August 2002 and the Workshop on a National Plan for Preserving Astronomical Photographic Plates in November 2007.

PARI hosts several educational opportunities, including the Duke University Talent Identification Program. PARI also sponsors astronomy educational programs using the portable StarLab planetarium. These have been presented to more than 40,000 people in Western North Carolina.

==Facilities==

The principal radio research instruments at PARI are two 26-meter radio telescopes and a 4.6-meter radio telescope named Smiley. These have been adapted for precision tracking of celestial radio sources using multiple frequencies. Smiley is used for remote classroom teaching of astronomy by students in the US and worldwide. Smiley was given its pleasant face around 1982 as a greeting to overflying foreign surveillance satellites.

PARI is home to the Astronomical Photographic Data Archive (APDA), a site to help preserve astronomical photographic plates. These plates were the primary recording medium for astronomy data from the late 19th century until the 1980s. It is estimated that over two million of the plates are held in astronomy facilities around the world and are in jeopardy of being destroyed because of a lack of storage facilities.

An Exhibit Gallery displays a collection of rare meteorites and minerals, as well as NASA Space Shuttle artifacts. Many of the latter are from space flights.

<doc id="769529" wikidata="Q1310203" url="?curid=769529" title="Independent suspension">
<text>Independent suspension is any automobile suspension system that allows each wheel on the same axle to move vertically (i.e. reacting to a bump on the road) independently of the others. This is contrasted with a beam axle or deDion axle system in which the wheels are linked. &quot;Independent&quot; refers to the motion or path of movement of the wheels or suspension. It is common for the left and right sides of the suspension to be connected with anti-roll bars or other such mechanisms. The anti-roll bar ties the left and right suspension spring rates together but does not tie their motion together.

Most modern vehicles have independent front suspension (IFS). Many vehicles also have an independent rear suspension (IRS). IRS, as the name implies, has the rear wheels independently sprung. A fully independent suspension has an independent suspension on all wheels. Some early independent systems used swing axles, but modern systems use Chapman or MacPherson struts, trailing arms, multilink, or wishbones.

Independent suspension typically offers better ride quality and handling characteristics, due to lower &quot;unsprung weight&quot; and the ability of each wheel to address the road undisturbed by activities of the other wheel on the vehicle. Independent suspension requires additional engineering effort and expense in development versus a beam or live axle arrangement. A very complex IRS solution can also result in higher manufacturing costs.

The key reason for lower unsprung weight relative to a live axle design is that, for driven wheels, the differential unit does not form part of the unsprung elements of the suspension system. Instead, it is either bolted directly to the vehicle&#x27;s chassis or more commonly to a subframe.

The relative movement between the wheels and the differential is achieved through the use of swinging driveshafts connected via universal joints (U joints), analogous to the constant-velocity (CV) joints used in front-wheel-drive vehicles.

==Independent suspension==

=== Suspension ===
Suspension is the only component that separates the driver and/or passenger from the ground. The suspension in a vehicle helps absorb harshness in the road. There are many systems and designs that do this, such as independent suspension.

=== Advantages ===
This system provides many advantages over other suspension systems. For example, in solid axle suspension systems, when one wheel hits a bump, it affects both wheels. This will compromise traction, smoothness of the ride, and could also cause a dangerous wheel shimmy when moving at high speeds. With independent suspension systems, the bump primarily affects only the contacted wheel. This offers many advantages such as greater ride comfort, better traction, and safer, more stable vehicles on the road.

== Types ==

===Double wishbone suspension===
In automobiles, a double wishbone suspension is an independent suspension design using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control the motion of the wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll center height, scrub radius, scuff and more.

===Multi-link suspension===
A multi-link suspension is a type of vehicle suspension design typically used in independent suspensions, using three or more lateral arms, and one or more longitudinal arms. A wider definition considers any independent suspensions having three control links or more multi-link suspensions. These arms do not have to be of equal length, and may be angled away from their &quot;obvious&quot; direction. It was first introduced in the late 1960s on the Mercedes-Benz C111 prototype and put into production later on their W201 and W124 series.

=== MacPherson strut ===
This is the most common, widely used front suspension system in cars today. It is a very simple and effective design that uses a strut-type spring and shock absorber that work as a team that will pivot on a single ball joint. This system was popularized in British Fords in the 1950s, then adopted by BMW (1962) and Porsche (1963). Later, this space-efficient system became widespread with the growing popularity of front-wheel drive vehicles.

One problem with this system is that once the spring or the top plate becomes worn, the driver of a car with this system may hear a loud &quot;clonk&quot; noise at full lock (i.e. steering wheel turned to the extreme left or extreme right positions), as the strut&#x27;s spring jumps back into place. This noise is often confused with CV-joint knock.

=== Transverse leaf-spring ===

Several independent suspension designs have featured transverse leaf springs. Most applications used multi-leaf steel springs, although more recent designs have used fiber reinforced plastic (FRP, typically fibers are fiberglass) springs. In addition to spring type (multi-leaf steel, FRP), a distinction can be drawn between systems where the spring also acts as a locating link and those where the spring only acts as a spring member.

The AC Cobra is an example of a transverse, multi-leaf steel spring suspension that uses the leaf spring as the upper suspension arm. Alternatively, the 1963 Corvette&#x27;s rear suspension is an example where the transverse leaf spring is used only as a ride spring. In both examples, the leaf spring is centrally mounted, preventing displacement of the wheel on one side from affecting the wheel on the other side.

In 1981, General Motors pioneered the use of a FRP plastic transverse leaf spring on the third-generation Corvette. As in the examples above, the spring used a single, central mount which isolated the left and right movements. The FRP spring reduced weight and eliminated the inner leaf friction as compared to the multi-leaf metal spring which was standard on the car.

Rather than centrally mounting the transverse leaf spring and thus isolating the left and right sides of the springs, some manufacturers, starting with Fiat used two widely spaced spring mounts. This was first used on the front of the 1955 Fiat 600 and later at the rear on the Fiat 128. The spring is allowed to pivot inside of the mounts which allows the displacement of the spring on one side to affect the other side. This mechanical communication between the left and right sides of the suspension results in an effect similar to that of an anti-roll bar. Chevrolet Corvettes, starting with the 4th generation in 1984 have combined the dual pivot mounts with FRP leaf springs.

The transverse leaf spring is not used as commonly as it was earlier. It is very rare on modern cars, the Corvette and a few Volvo models being examples. In the past it was more widely used in many Triumphs. The Herald, Vitesse, Spitfire, and GT6 all used a rear transverse leaf spring, as well as the 1995-98 Volvo 960/S90/V90 and a rare Swedish sports car incorporating the Volvo 960 rear suspension called the JC Indigo.

This type of suspension should not be confused with earlier, rigid axle applications such as those used on early Ford cars.

<text>The Lockheed LC-130 is a ski-equipped United States Air Force variant of the C-130 Hercules used in the Arctic and Antarctic. Ten are currently in service with the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard.

==Design and development==
The LC-130 started as a prototype model developed by modifying a &quot;C-130A&quot; with skis in 1956. After testing in 1957, 12 additional C-130A models were modified with skis and hydraulics under the designation of &quot;C-130D&quot;. In 1959 the first four factory equipped, ski-based Hercules were produced under the Navy designation of UV-1L. These C-130s are USAF C-130B models. Later in the program the designation was changed from UV-1L to C-130BL. This designation was again later changed to LC-130F when aircraft nomenclature was standardized for all services by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1962. These four aircraft were bought by the U.S. Navy to support the Navy&#x27;s Antarctic expedition that was ongoing at the time. The Navy also bought one LC-130R model in 1968. The National Science Foundation bought the second set of aircraft as replacement aircraft. The Polar Program Division of the Foundation had assumed management of the Antarctic Program in the early 1970s. These aircraft were designated LC-130R and were delivered in two lots: the first lot of three in 1974 and the remaining two in 1976.

The primary mission of the LC-130 is supporting the scientific community in Antarctica by transporting cargo and personnel from the McMurdo Station to field stations and camps, including the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station.
The aircraft are equipped with retractable skis that allow the aircraft to land on snow and ice as well as on conventional runways. The aircraft have provisions for using rocket-assisted-takeoff (RATO) rockets, four on each side of the aircraft, that are installed and used when the LC-130 operates from rough, unprepared snow surfaces, sticky snow or when shorter takeoff runs are needed. Originally the expended rocket bottles were jettisonable, but due to several accidents which occurred when a bottle detached from the aircraft during takeoff, the mounting provisions were changed so that the bottles could not be released in the air.

==Operational history==
The Navy Antarctic Development Squadron Six (First designated VX-6, then VXE-6 from 1969) originally operated the LC-130 aircraft. Initially, VXE-6 was home based at the Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island and later at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California. Operation of the aircraft was transferred in 1999 to the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard when Navy support of the Antarctic program was terminated. VXE-6 was decommissioned after 44 years of science and cargo support missions in support of &quot;Operation Deep Freeze&quot;.

There have been two crashes in Antarctica. The first crash occurred in 1971 at an ice runway from McMurdo Station as a result of two JATO bottles ejecting improperly and striking the plane&#x27;s propeller. This aircraft&#x27;s registration was 148321. The second crash occurred when a second similar aircraft (159131) was destroyed, while delivering replacement parts for the first aircraft; this resulted in two fatalities and nine injuries. The repaired aircraft was dug out of the snow, had temporary repairs and then flown to McMurdo Station in 1987 at a cost of $10 million and thence to Christchurch, New Zealand. It re-entered service and spent several more seasons doing antarctic work. The aircraft was retired to Davis-Monthan AFB sometime after 1998.

Currently all LC-130 aircraft are operated by the New York Air National Guard and are based at the Air National Guard&#x27;s facility at Schenectady County Airport. There are two versions. Seven aircraft are LC-130H-2 (Three of these were Navy LC-130R from VXE-6 converted to LC-130H-2). Three are the LC-130H-3 model.

==Aircraft on display==

* A D-model LC-130 is on display at the main entrance to Stratton Air National Guard Base, located at the Schenectady County Airport in Schenectady, NY.
* The Pima Air &amp; Space Museum has a 109th Tactical Airlift Group ski-equipped C-130D on display, one of the original twelve built before replacement of the fleet with the H model.

<doc id="769532" wikidata="Q1475713" url="?curid=769532" title="Funj Sultanate">
<text>The Funj Sultanate, also known as Funjistan, Sultanate of Sennar (after its capital Sennar) or Blue Sultanate (due to the traditional Sudanese convention of referring to black people as blue) (), was a monarchy in what is now Sudan, northwestern Eritrea and western Ethiopia. Founded in 1504 by the Funj people, it quickly converted to Islam, although this conversion was only nominal. Until a more orthodox form of Islam took hold in the 18th century, the state remained an &quot;African empire with a Muslim façade&quot;. It reached its peak in the late 17th century, but declined and eventually fell apart in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1821, the last sultan, greatly reduced in power, surrendered to the Ottoman Egyptian invasion without a fight.

==History==
===Origins===
Christian Nubia, represented by the two medieval kingdoms of Makuria and Alodia, began to decline from the 12th century. By 1365 Makuria had virtually collapsed and was reduced to a rump state restricted to Lower Nubia, until finally disappearing 150 years later. The fate of Alodia is less clear. It has been suggested that it had collapsed as early as the 12th century or shortly after, as archaeology suggests that in this period, Soba ceased to be used as its capital. By the 13th century central Sudan seemed to have disintegrated into various petty states. Between the 14th and 15th centuries Sudan was overrun by Bedouin tribes. In the 15th century one of these Bedouins, whom Sudanese traditions refer to as Abdallah Jammah, is recorded to have created a tribal federation and to have subsequently destroyed what was left of Alodia. In the early 16th century Abdallah&#x27;s federation came under attack from an invader to the south, the Funj.

The ethnic affiliation of the Funj is still disputed. The first and second of the three most prominent theories suggest that they were either Nubians or Shilluk, while, according to the third theory, the Funj were not an ethnic group, but a social class.

In the 14th century a Muslim Funj trader named al-Hajj Faraj al-Funi was involved in the Red Sea trade. According to oral traditions the Dinka, who migrated upstream the White and Blue Nile since the 13th-century disintegration of Alodia, came in conflict with the Funj, who the Dinka defeated. In the late 15th/early 16th century the Shilluk arrived at the junction of the Sobat and the White Nile, where they encountered a sedentary people Shilluk traditions refer to as &quot;Apfuny&quot;, &quot;Obwongo&quot; and/or &quot;Dongo&quot;, a people now equated with the Funj. Said to be more sophisticated than the Shilluk, they were defeated in a series of brutal wars and either assimilated or pushed north. Anti-Funj propaganda from the later period of the kingdom referred to the Funj as &quot;pagans from the White Nile&quot; and &quot;barbarians&quot; who had originated from the &quot;primitive southern swamps&quot;.

In 1504 the Funj defeated Abdallah Jammah and founded the Funj Sultanate.

===Ottoman threat and revolt of Ajib===

In 1523 the kingdom was visited by Jewish traveller David Reubeni, who disguised himself as a Sharif. Sultan Amara Dunqas, Reubeni wrote, was continuously travelling through his kingdom. He, who &quot;ruled over black people and white&quot; between the region south of the Nile confluence to as far north as Dongola, owned large herds of various types of animals and commanded many captains on horseback. Two years later, Ottoman admiral Selman Reis mentioned Amara Dunqas and his kingdom, calling it weak and easily conquerable. He also stated that Amara paid an annual tribute of 9,000 camels to the Ethiopian Empire. One year later the Ottomans occupied Sawakin, which beforehand was associated with Sennar. It seems that to counter the Ottoman expansion in the Red Sea region, the Funj engaged in an alliance with Ethiopia. Besides camels the Funj are known to have exported horses to Ethiopia, which were then used in war against the Adal Sultanate. The borders of Funj were raided by Ahmed Gurey during the war taking many slaves before stopping near the Taka mountain range near modern-day Kassala. 

Before the Ottomans gained a foothold in Ethiopia, in 1555, Özdemir Pasha was appointed Beylerbey of the (yet to be conquered) Habesh Eyalet. He attempted to march upstream along the Nile to conquer the Funj, but his troops revolted when they approached the first cataract of the Nile. Until 1570, however, the Ottomans had established themselves in Qasr Ibrim in Lower Nubia, most likely a preemptive move to secure Upper Egypt from Funj aggression. Fourteen years later they had pushed as far south as the third cataract of the Nile and subsequently attempted to conquer Dongola, but, in 1585, were crushed by the Funj at the battle of Hannik. Afterwards, the battlefield, which was located just south of the third Nile cataract, would mark the border between the two kingdoms. In the late 16th century the Funj pushed towards the Habesh Eyalet, conquering north-western Eritrea. Failing to make progress against both the Funj Sultanate and Ethiopia, the Ottomans abandoned their policy of expansion. Thus, from the 1590s onwards, the Ottoman threat vanished, rendering the Funj-Ethiopian alliance unnecessary, and relations between the two states were about to turn into open hostility. As late as 1597, however, the relations were still described as friendly, with trade flourishing.

In the meantime, the rule of sultan Dakin (1568–1585) saw the rise of Ajib, a minor king of northern Nubia. When Dakin returned from a failed campaign in the Ethiopian–Sudanese borderlands Ajib had acquired enough power to demand and receive greater political autonomy. A few years later he forced sultan Tayyib to marry his daughter, effectively making Tayyib and his offspring and successor, Unsa, his vassals. Unsa was eventually deposed in 1603/1604 by Abd al-Qadir II, triggering Ajib to invade the Funj heartland. His armies pushed the Funj king to the south-east. Thus, Ajib effectively ruled over an empire reaching from Dongola to Ethiopia. Abd el-Qadir II, eventually deposed in December 1606, fled to Ethiopia and submitted to emperor Susenyos, providing Susenyos with an opportunity to intervene in the sultanate&#x27;s affairs. However, the new Funj sultan, Adlan I, managed to turn the tide of war against Ajib, eventually killing him in 1611 or 1612. While chasing the remnants of Ajib&#x27;s army to the north, Adlan II himself was deposed and succeeded by a son of the former sultan Abd al-Qadir II, Badi I. He issued a peace treaty with the sons of Ajib, agreeing to factually split the Funj state. The successors of Ajib, the Abdallab, would receive everything north of the confluence of Blue and White Nile, which they would rule as vassal kings of Sennar. Therefore, the Funj lost direct control over much of their kingdom.

In 1618-1619 Bahr Negash Gebre Mariam, ruler of the Medri Bahri, helped Emperor Susneyos in a military campaign against the Sennar Sultanate. Emperor Susneyos sent Bahr Gebre to attack Mandara whose queen, Fatima, controlled a strategic caravan road from Suakin. The Bahr Negash was successful in capturing Queen Fatima, which he sent back to Emperor Susenyos&#x27; palace in Danqaz (Gorgora) and she renewed submission to the Ethiopian Empire.

===17th century peak===

The submission of Abd al-Qadir II to the Ethiopian emperor and the possibility of a consequential invasion remained a problem for the Funj sultans. Adlan I had apparently been too weak to do something against this situation, but Badi I was able to take matters into his own hands. A rich present by Susenyos, which he perhaps sent in the belief that the successors of Abd al-Qadir II would honour the submission of the latter, was rudely answered with two lame horses and first raids of Ethiopian posts. Susenyos, occupied elsewhere, would not respond to that act of aggression until 1617 when he raided several Funj provinces. This mutual raiding finally escalated into a full-fledged war in 1618 and 1619, resulting in the devastation of many of the Funj eastern provinces. A pitched battle was also fought, claimed by the Ethiopian sources to have been a victory, albeit this is posed doubtful by the fact that the Ethiopian troops retreated immediately afterwards. After the war, the two countries remained at peace for over a century.

The Funj sultan who ruled during the war, Rabat I, was the first in a series of three monarchs under whom the sultanate entered a period of prosperity, expansion and increased contacts with the outside world, but was also confronted with several new problems.

In the 17th century, the Shilluk and Sennar were forced into an uneasy alliance to combat the growing might of the Dinka. After the alliance had run its cause, in 1650, Sultan Badi II occupied the northern half of the Shilluk Kingdom. Under his rule the Funj defeated the Kingdom of Taqali to the west and made its ruler his vassal.

===Decline===

Sennar was at its peak at the end of the 17th century, but during the 18th century, it began to decline as the power of the monarchy was eroded. The greatest challenge to the authority of the king were the merchant funded Ulama who insisted it was rightfully their duty to mete out justice.

In about 1718 the previous dynasty, the Unsab, was overthrown in a coup and replaced by Nul, who, although related to the previous Sultan, effectively founded a dynasty on his own. 

In 1741 and 1743 the young Ethiopian emperor Iyasu II conducted raids westwards, attempting to acquire quick military fame. In March 1744 he assembled an army of 30,000–100,000 men for a new expedition, which was initially intended as yet another raid, but soon turned into a war of conquest. On the banks of the Dinder river the two states fought a pitched battle, which went in favour of Sennar. Traveller James Bruce noted that Iyasu II, plundered his way back to Ethiopia, allowing him to display his campaign as a success. Meanwhile, Badi IV&#x27;s repulsion of the Ethiopian invasion made him a national hero. Hostilities between the two states continued until the end of Iyasu II&#x27;s reign in 1755, tensions caused by this war were still recorded in 1773. Trade, however, soon resumed after the conflict, although on reduced scale.
It has been suggested that it was Badi&#x27;s victory over the Ethiopians that strengthened his power; in 1743/1744 he is known to have had his vizier executed and to have taken the reins. He attempted to create a new power base by purging the previous ruling clan, stripping the nobility of their land and instead empowering clients from the western and southern periphery of his realm. One of these clients was Muhammad Abu Likaylik, a Hamaj (a generic Sudannese term applied to the pre-Funj, non-Arabic or semi-Arabized people of the Gezira and Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands) from east of Fazughli who was granted land immediately south of Sennar in 1747/1748. He was a cavalry commander tasked to pacify Kordofan, which had become a battlefield between the Funj and the Musabb’at, refugees from the Sultanate of Darfur. The Fur had the upper hand until 1755, when Abu Likayik finally managed to overrun Kordofan and turn it into his new powerbase. In the meantime, Sultan Badi grew increasingly unpopular due to his repressive measures. Eventually, Abu Likayik was convinced by disaffected Funj noblemen, many of them residing in Kordofan, to march on the capital. In 1760/1761 he reached Alays at the White Nile, where a council was held in which Badi was formally deposed. Afterwards, he besieged Sennar, which he entered on 27 March 1762. Badi fled to Ethiopia but was murdered in 1763. Thus began the Hamaj Regency, where the Funj monarchs became puppets of the Hamaj.

Abu Likayik installed another member of the royal family as his puppet sultan and ruled as regent. This began a long conflict between the Funj sultans attempting to reassert their independence and authority and the Hamaj regents attempting to maintain control of the true power of the state. These internal divisions greatly weakened the state and in the late 18th century Mek Adlan II, son of Mek Taifara, took power during a turbulent time at which a Turkish presence was being established in the Funj kingdom. The Turkish ruler, Al-Tahir Agha, married Khadeeja, daughter of Mek Adlan II. This paved the way for the assimilation of the Funj into the Ottoman Empire.

The later 18th century saw a rapid disintegration of the Funj state. In 1785/1786 the Fur Sultanate conquered Kordofan which it managed to hold until the Egyptian invasion of 1821. In the second half of the 18th century Sennar lost the Tigre in what is now Eritrea to the rising &quot;naib&quot; (&quot;deputy&quot;) of Massawa, while after 1791 Taka around the Sudanese Mareb River made itself independent. The Shukriya became the new dominant power in the Butana. The long isolated province of Dongola finally fell to the Shaiqiya in around 1782, who installed a loyal puppet dynasty. After 1802, the authority of the sultanate was limited to the Gezira for good. In the early years of the 19th century the kingdom was plagued by excessive civil wars. Regent Muhammad Adlan, who rose to power in 1808 and whose father had been assassinated by a warlord of that period, was able to put an end to these wars and managed to stabilize the kingdom for another 13 years.

In 1820, Ismail bin Muhammad Ali, the general and son of the nominally Ottoman vassal Muhammad Ali Pasha, began the conquest of Sudan. Realizing that the Turks were about to conquer his domain, Muhammad Adlan prepared to resist and ordered to muster the army at the Nile confluence, but he fell to a plot near Sennar in early 1821. One of the murderers, a man named Daf&#x27;Allah, rode back to the capital to prepare Sultan Badi VII&#x27;s submission ceremony to the Turks. The Turks reached the Nile confluence in May 1821. Afterwards, they travelled upstream the Blue Nile until reaching Sennar. They were disappointed to learn that Sennar, once enjoying a reputation of wealth and splendour, was now reduced to a heap of ruins. On 14 June they received the official submission of Badi VII.

==Government==
===Administration===

The sultans of Sennar were powerful, but not absolutely so, as a council of 20 elders also had a say in state decisions. Below the king stood the chief minister, the &quot;amin&quot;, and the &quot;jundi&quot;, who supervised the market and acted as commander of the state police and intelligence service. Another high court official was the &quot;sid al-qum&quot;, a royal bodyguard and executioner. Only he was allowed to shed royal blood, as he was tasked to kill all brothers of a freshly elected king to prevent civil wars.

The state was divided into several provinces governed by a &quot;manjil&quot;. Each of these province was again divided into sub-provinces governed by a &quot;makk&quot;, each of them subordinated to their respective &quot;manjil&quot;. The most important &quot;manjil&quot; was the one of the Abdallabs, followed by Alays at the White Nile, the kings of the Blue Nile region and finally the rest. The king of Sennar exercised his influence among the &quot;manjils&quot; forcing them to marry a woman from the royal clan, which acted as royal spies. A member of the royal clan also always sat at their side, observing their behaviour. Furthermore, the &quot;manjils&quot; had to travel to Sennar every year to pay tribute and account for their deeds.

It was under king Badi II when Sennar became the fixed capital of the state and when written documents concerning administrative matters appeared, with the oldest known one dating to 1654.

===Military===
The army of Sennar was feudal. Each noble house could field a military unit measured in its power by its horsemen. The population, although generally armed, was only rarely called to war, in cases of uttermost need. Most Funj warriors were slaves traditionally captured in annual slave raids called &quot;salatiya&quot;, targeting the stateless non-Muslims in the Nuba mountains pejoratively referred to as &quot;Fartit&quot;. The army was divided into infantry, represented by an official called &quot;muqaddam al-qawawid&quot;, and cavalry, represented by the &quot;muqaddam al-khayl&quot;. The Sultan rarely led armies into battle and instead appointed a commander for the duration of the campaign, called &quot;amin jaysh al-sultan&quot;. At its peak the Funj Sultanate was probably able to field about 5,000 horsemen, while in 1772 James Bruce estimated that lightly armed slave warriors fighting as infantry amounted to about 14,000 men. Nomadic warriors fighting for the Funj had an own appointed leader, the &quot;aqid&quot; or &quot;qa’id&quot;. Shilluk and Dinka mercenaries were also utilized.

The weaponry of the Funj warriors consisted of thrusting lances, throwing knives, javelins, hide shields and, most importantly, long broadswords which could be wielded with two hands. Body armour consisted of leather or quilts and additionally mail, while the hands were protected by leather gloves. On the heads iron or copper helmets were worn. The horses were also armoured, wearing thick quilts, copper headgear and breast plates. While armour was also manufactured locally, it was at times imported as well. In the late 17th century Sultan Badi III attempted to modernize the army by importing firearms and even cannons, but they were quickly disregarded after his death not only because the import was expensive and unreliable, but also because the traditionally armed elites feared for their power. James Bruce remarked that the Sultan had &quot;not one musket in his whole army&quot;. 40 years later Johann Ludwig Burckhardt noted that Mek Nimr, the now independent lord of Shendi, maintained a small force of slaves armed with muskets bought or stolen from Egyptian merchants. While they were in bad shape their mere display was enough to cause terror among Nimr&#x27;s enemies. In 1820 the Shaiqiya were said to have a few pistols and guns, although the overwhelming majority still used traditional weapons.

==Culture==
===Religion===
====Islam====

By the time of the visit by David Reubeni in 1523, the Funj, originally Pagans or syncretic Christians, had converted to Islam. They probably converted to ease their rule over their Muslim subjects and to facilitate trade with neighbouring countries like Egypt. Their embracement of Islam was only nominal and, in fact, the Funj effectively even delayed the Islamization of Nubia, as they temporarily strengthened African sacral traditions instead. The monarchy they established was divine, similar to that of many other African states: The Funj Sultan had hundreds of wives and spent most of his reign within the palace, secluded from his subjects and maintaining contact only with a handful of officials. He was not allowed to be seen eating. On the rare occasion he appeared in public he did so only with a veil and accompanied by much pomp. The Sultan was judged regularly and, if found wanting, could be executed. All Funj, but especially the Sultan, were believed to be able to detect sorcery. Islamic talismans written in Sennar were believed to have special powers due to the proximity to the Sultan. Among the populace even the basics of Islamic faith were not widely known. Pork and beer were consumed as staple food throughout much of the kingdom, the death of an important individual would be mourned by &quot;communal dancing, self-mutilation and rolling in the ashes of the feast-fire&quot;. At least in some regions, elderly, crippled and others who believed to be a burden for their relatives and friends were expected to request to be buried alive or otherwise disposed. As late as the late 17th century the Funj Sultanate was still recorded to not follow the &quot;laws of the Turks”, i. e. Islam. Thus, until the 18th century Islam was not much more than a facade.

Despite this, the Funj acted as sponsors of Islam from the very beginning, encouraging the settlement of Muslim holy men in their domain. In the later period civil wars forced the peasants to look to the holy men for protection; the sultans lost the peasant population to the Ulama.

====Christianity====

The collapse of the Christian Nubian states went hand in hand with the collapse of the Christian institutions. The Christian faith, however, would continue to exist, although gradually declining. By the sixteenth century large portions of Nubia&#x27;s population would still have been Christian. Dongola, the former capital and Christian center of the Makurian kingdom, was recorded to have been largely Islamized by the turn of the 16th century, although a Franciscan letter confirms the existence of a community immediately south of Dongola practicing a &quot;debased Christianity&quot; as late as 1742. According to the 1699 account of Poncet, Muslims reacted to meeting Christians in the streets of Sennar by reciting the Shahada. The Fazughli region seems to have been Christian at least for one generation after its conquest in 1685; a Christian principality was mentioned in the region as late as 1773. The Tigre in north-western Eritrea, who were part of the Beni Amer confederation, remained Christians until the 19th century.
Rituals stemming from Christian traditions outlived the conversion to Islam and were still practiced as late as the 20th century.

From the 17th century foreign Christian groups, mostly merchants, were present in Sennar, including Copts, Ethiopians, Greeks, Armenians and Portuguese. The sultanate also served as interstation for Ethiopian Christians travelling to Egypt and the Holy Land as well as European missionaries travelling to Ethiopia.

===Languages===

In the Christian period, Nubian languages had been spoken between the region from Aswan in the north to an undetermined point south of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile. They remained important during the Funj period, but were gradually superseded by Arabic. This process was largely accomplished in central Sudan by the 19th century, although even then there were limited reports of Nubian still being spoken as far south as the 5th cataract, if not Shendi.

After the Funj conversion to Islam, Arabic grew to become the lingua franca of administration and trade while also being employed as language of religion. While the royal court would continue to speak their pre-Arabic language for some time by 1700, the language of communication at the court had become Arabic. In the 18th century, Arabic became the written language of state administration. As late as 1821, when the kingdom fell, some provincial noblemen were still not capable of speaking Arabic. Evliya Çelebi (17th century) and Joseph Russegger (mid 19th century) described a pre-Arabic language in the Funj heartland. Çelebi provided a listing of numerals as well as a poem, both written in Arabic script; the numerals are clearly Kanuri, while the language used for the poem remains unidentified. Russegger stated that a &quot;Fungi&quot; language, sounding similar to Nubian and having absorbed many Arabic words, was spoken as far north as Khartoum, albeit already reduced to a secondary role compared to Arabic. In Kordofan, Nubian was still spoken as primary or at least secondary language as late as the 1820s and 1830s.

==Trade==
During the reign of sultan Badi III in the late 17th and early 18th century the prosperous and cosmopolitan capital of Sennar was described as &quot;close to being the greatest trading city&quot; in all Africa. The wealth and power of the sultans had long rested on the control of the economy. All caravans were controlled by the monarch, as was the gold supply that functioned as the state&#x27;s main currency. Important revenues came from customs dues levied on the caravan routers leading to Egypt and the Red Sea ports and on the pilgrimage traffic from the Western Sudan. In the late 17th century the Funj had opened up trading with the Ottoman Empire. In the late 17th century with the introduction of coinage, an unregulated market system took hold, and the sultans lost control of the market to a new merchant middle class. Foreign currencies became widely used by merchants breaking the power of the monarch to closely control the economy. The thriving trade created a wealthy class of educated and literate merchants, who read widely about Islam and became much concerned about the lack of orthodoxy in the kingdom.
The Sultanate also did their best to monopolize the slave trade to Egypt, most notably through the annual caravan of up to one thousand slaves. This monopoly was most successful in the seventeenth century, although it still worked to some extent in the eighteenth.

<text>The Israel national football team () represents Israel in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Israel Football Association. They have been members of the European Confederation UEFA since 1994.

Israel qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 1970. They also won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup, before a forced relocation to UEFA.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Football has a long tradition in Israel. The game was originally introduced during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestine Football Association was formed in August 1928, and joined FIFA in June 1929, but at the time the association was made up of Arab and Jewish clubs as well as clubs of British policemen and soldiers serving in the region during the British Mandate. The Mandatory Palestine national football team made its debut against Cairo (&quot;Egypt&quot;) in 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification, losing 0–5 in Cairo, Egypt. The team played five international matches, including a friendly match against Lebanon that Palestine won 1–5; until the British Mandate for Palestine national team was dissolved. During these five games, the national team fielded only Jewish players. Three anthems were played before each match: the British &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the Jewish (and future Israeli) &quot;HaTikvah&quot;, and the opposing team&#x27;s anthem.

In 1948 the team became the national football team of Israel. The Israel national team&#x27;s first match as an independent nation was on 26 September 1948, against the US Olympic Team. The game was won by the US 1–3, and in the 20th minute of the game Shmuel Ben-Dror scored the first goal after the creation of the State of Israel.

===Asian Football Confederation membership===

====Muslim and Arab countries boycotting Israel====
Israel was one of the founding members of the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) following its independence in 1948. After the 1974 Asian Games in Iran, and Israel&#x27;s 0–1 tense loss to Iran in the finals, Kuwait and other Muslim and Arab countries refused to play them. Following this, Israel was expelled from the confederation. It tried to join continental bodies such as the OFC (Oceania), before eventually joining UEFA (Europe).

====Israel&#x27;s last years in the AFC====
Israel competed at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) between 1954 and 1974. Due to the Arab League boycott of Israel, several Muslim countries refused to compete against Israel. The political situation culminated in Israel winning the 1958 World Cup qualifying stage for Asia and Africa without playing a single game, forcing FIFA to schedule a playoff between Israel and Wales to ensure the team did not qualify without playing at least one game (which Wales won).

Israel hosted and won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup.

In 1968, Israel went to its first Olympic Games and lost to Bulgaria in the quarterfinals.
In 1969, Israel qualified for its first and only FIFA World Cup, via Asia/Oceania. Israel earned two points after a 1–1 draw with Sweden, a 0–0 draw with eventual finalist Italy, and a 0–2 loss to Uruguay. The goal against Sweden, scored by Mordechai Spiegler, is Israel&#x27;s only FIFA World Cup goal to date.

In 1974, Israel was excluded from AFC competitions, after Kuwait and other Muslim and Arab countries refused to play against it. The proposal was adopted by a vote of 17 to 13 with 6 abstentions. The vote coincided with the 1974 Asian Games, where the football competition was marred by the refusal of both North Korea and Kuwait to play second-round matches against Israel.

In 1976, Israel went to its second Olympic Games and lost in the quarterfinals again, this time against Brazil. In 1973 and 1977, Israel participated in the World Cup qualification tournament which included teams from both Asia and Oceania, but failed to qualify.

===Years in exile===

====First steps in UEFA====
During the early 1980s, Israel played the majority of its matches against UEFA (Europe) teams, and competed in the European stage of qualification for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

====First steps in OFC====
For the next two tournaments, Israel entered Oceania&#x27;s (OFC) qualification stage.

In 1989, Israel won the OFC second round (Oceania) by finishing above both Australia and New Zealand. As a result, Israel made it to the CONMEBOL–OFC play-offs to represent Oceania and play against CONMEBOL&#x27;s (South America) Colombia for the 1990 World Cup, but lost (1–0, 0–0).

===UEFA membership===
In 1991, Israeli clubs began participating in European club competitions of UEFA, and Israel returned to the European leg of World Cup qualifying in 1992. In 1994, Israel received full UEFA membership, 20 years after it had left Asia. Within Europe, Israel has been a relatively minor nation, though with some successes, notably winning 3–2 in Paris against France in 1993, and 5–0 against Austria in 1999. That year, Israel made it to the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs, but was beaten by Denmark.

Israel came close to advancing to the playoff stage in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group, finishing third, behind France, and tied on points with Switzerland, which also remained unbeaten in 10 matches after 4 wins and 6 draws. The Swiss had a better goal difference, though, and advanced to the qualification play-off. Coach Avram Grant announced his resignation on 26 October 2005. After the end of his contract, he was succeeded by Dror Kashtan.

In UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, Israel came very close to qualifying for the final tournament, but finished fourth in Group E, just one point behind second-placed Russia, who qualified directly with Croatia, and level on 23 points with England, who also failed to advance. The 4–3 home loss to Croatia was the first loss after 13 consecutive official games and 9 home games without a loss.

In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Israel again came in fourth, behind Switzerland, Greece, and Latvia. For the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Kashtan was replaced as coach by Frenchman Luis Fernández but Israel failed to qualify again, finishing third behind Greece and Croatia.

The continued presence of the Israeli Football Association in UEFA was a precedent cited by Australia to justify its transfer from the Oceania Football Confederation to the Asian Football Confederation.

In 2018, Willi Ruttensteiner was appointed as technical director. A national football academy was founded and three supporting development centers were established.

Israel subsequently failed to qualify for any World Cup or European Championship finals, and performed inconsistently during the qualifying phases in which they took part, alternating between the good and the not-so-good. However, in the qualifiers for Euro 2020, they came very close to making history. Despite finishing 5th and penultimate in their particularly homogeneous qualifying group, Israel earned the right to play in the play-offs thanks to their position in the 2018-2019 edition of the Nations League. They first had to play in the semi-final of the Path C play-off in Scotland to earn the right to play in the final of the play-off in Serbia, which defeated Norway away in extra time. The game was tight, and the Israelis were finally eliminated in a penalty shoot-out after a goalless draw in regulation time and extra time (0–0, 3:5), Eran Zahavi having missed the first Israeli shot.

Promoted to League B for the 2020-2021 edition of the Nations League without having finished top of their group in the previous edition, thanks to the change of format subsequently decided by UEFA, Israel ensured their survival by finishing 3rd and penultimate in their group, with a balanced record of 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. At the 2022-2023 Nations League, Israel finished top of its 3-team group (Russia, which should have taken part, was excluded from European and international competitions due to its aggression against Ukraine), thanks to 2 wins over Albania (2–1 in both legs) and 2 draws against Iceland (2–2 on each occasion), synonymous with promotion to League A for the 2024-2025 edition.

In the Euro 2024 qualifiers, Israel was again eliminated at the play-off stage, as in the previous edition. Indeed, they finished 3rd in their qualifying group and saw their place in the play-offs assured thanks to their status as group winners at the 2022-2023 Nations League. Against Iceland in the semi-finals of the play-offs for Path B, they opened the scoring with Eran Zahavi&#x27;s 31st-minute penalty, but failed to hold on to their advantage and were soundly beaten (1–4). The turning points of the match were Roy Revivo&#x27;s 73rd-minute red card for a crude foul, and Eran Zahavi&#x27;s penalty miss 7 minutes after the red card, when the score was 1–2.

==Home stadium==

The first home game of the Israel national football team was at Palms Ground on 6 April 1934 against Egypt in a 1934 World Cup qualifier. Prior to the formation of Israel, they also played at the Maccabi Ground for the 1938 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and Maccabiah Stadium. The first national team to represent the newly formed State of Israel back in 1948, had played at the Ramat Gan Stadium as part of 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, in front of 55,000 spectators. The Ramat Gan Stadium would remain Israel&#x27;s home stadium until 2013.

Since the construction of Sammy Ofer Stadium in the city of Haifa, Teddy Stadium in the city of Jerusalem, Turner Stadium in the city of Be&#x27;er Sheva, Netanya Stadium in the city of Netanya and Bloomfield Stadium in the city of Tel Aviv – the Israel national team has rotated their official home matches between the latter five.

During the Israel–Hamas war, Israel played most of their home matches in Hungary.

<doc id="769542" wikidata="Q5191857" url="?curid=769542" title="Cuarenta">
<text>Cuarenta is the national card game of Ecuador. It is a fishing game played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).

This game is almost exclusively played in Ecuador. The name of the game, &quot;&quot; is Spanish for the number 40 (). This refers to the number of points that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it. Two chicas or the first chica with (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a &quot;mesa&quot;, literally meaning &quot;table&quot;, which in this context refers to &quot;match&quot;). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams. Cuarenta is the national card game of Ecuador and even has official tournaments. 

The score is kept with two kinds of chips, the two-point tantos (points) and the ten-point s (dogs). When a standard 52 card pack is used, the 8s, 9s and 10s can be used to keep the score.

==Game==
Five cards are dealt to each player, given out as a hand of five cards at a time starting counterclockwise. The opponent of the dealer or the opponents of the dealer&#x27;s team are given ten points if there are any irregularities during the deal itself, and the dealer&#x27;s turn is handed over to the opponent (&quot;pasa la mano con diez&quot;, hand over the deal with ten points). A typical indication of these irregularities is that the dealer finds himself or herself with 4 or 6 cards in his or her hand after the second deal. The cards left over after the first deal are placed face down on a stack to the side.

Before the first individual turn after each deal, special announcements have to be made by each player if applicable. These are the &quot;doble ronda&quot; (four cards of the same rank) and the &quot;ronda&quot; (gathering of people, patrol, gang; three cards of the same rank). A &quot;doble ronda&quot; automatically wins the game; a &quot;ronda&quot; scores two points.

The player to the dealer&#x27;s right begins. The turn to play passes counterclockwise. Each player plays one card face up onto the table. Cards on the table may be captured by the opponent. If cards are captured, they are placed face down in front of the player or his teammate. Played cards remain on the table until they are captured or the round ends. Cards can be captured in the following three ways: &quot;matching&quot; (card same rank as on the table; player places matching card onto own pile), &quot;addition&quot; (two cards add to the value of the other; a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 6; an ace, a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 7; cards with pictures have no value and cannot be captured this way), and &quot;sequence&quot; (a card captured by matching or addition entitles the picking of the next higher card; matching a 2 entitles the capturing of the 3 and 4 (etc.), as well, should there be any). Note that, due to the absence of 8s, 9s, and 10s, the Jack follows the 7 in sequence. A table with the cards 3 4 J Q K can be cleaned with a 7 (3 and 4 add to 7, then J Q K continue the sequence), capturing a total of 6 cards. The Ace does not follow the King. The Ace counts as one for all purposes of this game.

==Scoring==
If a player clears the table by capturing all cards, he scores a &quot;limpia&quot; (meaning &quot;a cleansing&quot; or &quot;a wiping out&quot; of the table; 2 points). If a player captures the card just played by the player before, this is called a &quot;caída&quot; (meaning &quot;a fall&quot;. These two often happen at the same time; under the &quot;official&quot; Quito rules of the Asociación de Periodistas Deportivos de Pichincha (the association of sports journalists of the province of Pichincha), no additional points are scored for this combination (the &quot;caída&quot; or the &quot;limpia&quot; may be scored, but not both). In the Cuenca rules variation, both events are scored, for a total of 4 points. This variation in scoring is not necessarily regional. Some tournaments may give the match (chica) for a &quot;doble ronda&quot; or &quot;caida en ronda&quot; in the interest of shortening the duration of the entire tournament. In Quito only 4 points are given for &quot;doble ronda&quot; or &quot;caida en ronda&quot;. A summary of these variations is shown below:

After all five cards are played, there is a new deal. After a new deal, &quot;caída&quot; does not apply to any cards remaining on the table. After all cards have been played (2 deals with 4 players, 4 deals with 2 players), each player or team counts their collected cards. If the number of collected cards is 20, 6 points are scored; an additional point is given for each captured card in excess of 20, rounded to the next even number. So, 21 cards gives 8 points, 22 cards still gives 8 points. 23 or 24 cards give 10 points. If both teams capture 20 cards, neither side scores 6 points. In this case and all other ties, the non-dealing team scores 2 points. This is called &quot;dos por darlas&quot;, &quot;two for dealing (next)&quot;, as the scoring team will deal the next round. If neither team captures 20 cards, the team with more cards scores 2 points. 

If a team reaches exactly 38 points, that team is &quot;out of play,&quot; called &quot;38 que no juega&quot; (38 that doesn&#x27;t play). The final two points that achieve victory may only be scored by &quot;caída&quot;. Existing captured cards, limpia, ronda will not count towards closing the game for that team.

A chica is won when a player or team reaches 40 points. The game is won when a player or a team wins two chicas or when the opponent doesn&#x27;t reach ten points at the end of the first chica (this last kind of loss is known as &quot;zapatería&quot;). Losing as &quot;zapatero&quot; immediately disqualifies the team from a tournament or match.

If the opponent loses with &quot;zapatería&quot; (he doesn&#x27;t score a perro = ten points), he&#x27;s called &quot;zapatero&quot;, probably because he ends up &quot;poor&quot; like a shoemaker (zapato = shoe). It may also be related to the expression &quot;Cero, zapatero&quot;, a common rhyme colloquially used when referring to the number cero.

<text>Fastiv (, ) is a city in the Kyiv Oblast (province) in central Ukraine. On older maps it is depicted as Chvastiv (, ). Administratively, it serves as the administrative centre of the Fastiv Raion (district), to which it does not administratively belong. Fastiv hosts the administration of Fastiv urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is approximately 

Lying on conjunction of railway lines, Fastiv is an important node station on the rail route from central Europe to Russia and Asia. On 1 December 1918 at the Fastiv train station delegations of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic signed the Unification Act uniting territories of Ukraine that were split between Austrian and Russian empires.

Beside transportation industry, Brewing and machinery industry are also present, although the majority of inhabitants are employed by Ukrzaliznytsia&#x27;s 12 railway installations in the city.

==History==
The foundation date of the city is not known. Under its current name the populated place is first mentioned as early as 1390 in old Rus&#x27; chronicles where it is stated that Prince of Kyiv Vladimir Olgerdovich issued a certificate that stated that Fastiv belonged to Rozhanovsky princes.

Fastiv is a historical city that survived through many times Cossack uprisings and the Great Turkish War with the period of total devastation and later resettlement. In 1685 it became one of centers of revived Cossack movement in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth following the Treaty of Andrusovo. In early 18th century around Fastiv took place Paliy uprising. Following the unsuccessful military campaign of Pylyp Orlyk in 1711, remnants of his military force withdrew to Fastiv after the 1711 siege of Bila Tserkva.

In the second half of 18th century, Fastiv was one of centers of another local uprising known as Koliyivshchyna.

In 1793 the town was ceded to the Russian Empire as part of the Second Partition of Poland and the complete Russian occupation of the Right-bank Ukraine.

In 1825 during the Decembrist revolt in Saint Petersburg, the Imperial Russian troops quartered around Fastiv and Vasylkiv supported the revolt. In the mid 19th century around Fastiv, the Imperial Russian archaeological commission conducted archaeological excavations of the &quot;Perepiat kurgan&quot; which were attended by Taras Shevchenko as an experienced artist.

The loss in Crimean War, led to intensive development of railroad network throughout the Russian Empire and in 1870 through Fastiv was installed the Kyiv–Odesa railroad.

As Chwastów (Fastów), it is mentioned in the 19th century Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland being a town of the Vasylkiv county.

In 1898 Fastiv became a permanent residence of Imperial Russian inventor Nikolay Benardos out of the Central Ukraine who is known for developing of arc welding in the Russian Empire.

In September 1919, a pogrom of the Jewish population of Fastiv was carried out by Denikin&#x27;s White Army forces (Fastov massacre). About 1,800 people were murdered and about 8,000 died in the following year from wounds or epidemics. In 1941 the Nazi Einsatzgruppe C under Paul Blobel murdered all Fastiv Jews between the ages of 12 and 60.

Until 18 July 2020, Fastiv was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also served as the administrative center of Fastiv Raion even though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven, the city of Fastiv was merged into Fastiv Raion.

<text>Helen Elizabeth Garrett, commonly known as Elizabeth Garrett or Beth Garrett (June 30, 1963 – March 6, 2016), was an American professor of law and academic administrator. On July 1, 2015, she became the 13th president of Cornell University—the first woman to serve as president of the university. She died from colon cancer on March 6, 2016, the first Cornell president to die while in office.

==Early life and education==
Garrett was born in Oklahoma City on June 30, 1963, to Robert and Jane Garrett. According to her mother, Garrett began to read very early and thereafter was never seen without a book in her hand. At age 3, according to Jane, young Garrett announced she would be a lawyer—Garrett, more modestly, claimed she was 5. Her father, Robert, had earned a law degree, though he worked as president of a savings and loan. An uncle and grandfather were also lawyers.

Jane&#x27;s great-grandfather was the first to open a school in the Choctaw Reservation town of Lehigh, Oklahoma. Her parents taught her and her sister Laura that when they finished a task, they should start on something else.

Garrett earned her Bachelor of Arts in history with special distinction from the University of Oklahoma in 1985. In a 2004 interview, David Levy, Garrett&#x27;s favorite history professor at the University of Oklahoma, said that Garrett would finish the weekly quiz ahead of the other students and, in the same motion, turn over the paper and reach for next week&#x27;s reading. Levy also said of Garrett that he &quot;never had a student who made better use of time.&quot; As a sophomore at the University of Oklahoma, Garrett became chair of student congress, the University of Oklahoma Student Government Association, a position she held until she graduated.

In 1988, she received her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.

After law school, Garrett clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and for Judge Stephen F. Williams on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She also served as a legal advisor at the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague and as legislative director and tax and budget counsel for Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma. Boren said about Garrett, &quot;If I were to count on the fingers of one hand the people I’ve known with the most remarkable intellect, she would be on that list.&quot;

==Academia==
Garrett&#x27;s primary scholarly interests included legislative process, the initiative and referendum process and the federal budget process. Among her prolific writings, she was co-author of the preeminent case book on legislation and statutory interpretation, &quot;Cases and Materials on Legislation and Regulation: Statutes and the Creation of Public Policy&quot; (2014). She was also co-editor of &quot;Fiscal Challenges: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Budget Policy and Statutory Interpretation Stories&quot;. Her interdisciplinary scholarship used insights from economics and political science to understand how to design democratic institutions to ensure outcomes more consistent with citizen preferences—and how those preferences might be shaped by the political and legal environments.

Garrett was a professor of law at the University of Chicago from 1995 to 1999 and also served as deputy dean for academic affairs. She also taught as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Virginia Law School, Central European University in Budapest, and the Interdisciplinary Center Law School in Israel.

=== Career at the University of Southern California ===

Garrett began her tenure at the University of Southern California in 2003 as the Frances R. and John J. Duggan Professor of Law and Vice Provost. 

In 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Garrett to serve on the nine-member bipartisan President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform. Its report was issued later in that same year.

On March 30, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama nominated Garrett to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy in the Department of Treasury. Garrett withdrew her nomination on May 29, 2009, citing &quot;aspects of my personal family situation.&quot;

From 2009 to 2014, she served on the California Fair Political Practices Commission. She also served as director of the USC-Caltech Center for the Study of Law and Politics. Garrett also served on the boards of the Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute at USC and on the Internet2 Board of Directors.

Between 2010 and 2015, Garrett served as Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, USC&#x27;s second-ranking officer under USC President C. L. Max Nikias. As provost, she proved a superb administrator with a complex portfolio. In addition to serving as a professor in the USC Gould School of Law, Garrett oversaw the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, as well as the Keck School of Medicine of USC. She also hired Provost Professors and founded the Provost&#x27;s Postdoctoral Scholars Program in the Humanities. Over the course of two years, Garrett formed The USC Strategic Vision: &quot;Matching Deeds to Ambitions&quot;, which the Board of Trustees accepted in December 2011.

=== President of Cornell University ===

On September 30, 2014, Cornell University&#x27;s Board of Trustees unanimously elected Garrett as the 13th president of Cornell University. The university&#x27;s search for a president began when incumbent president David J. Skorton announced in March 2014 that he would be leaving Cornell on June 30, 2015, to become the next secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. She was selected after a six-month search in which some two hundred candidates were considered. Garrett was the first woman selected to lead Cornell University.

==== Inauguration Ceremony ====
Garrett&#x27;s inauguration ceremony was held on September 18, 2015, on the Arts Quadrangle of Cornell University. She delivered her inaugural address in front of the iconic statue of Ezra Cornell. She spoke of &quot;the spirit of Cornell that frames our journey&quot; and stressed the importance of the faculty as the foundation of the university; students as partners in the voyage of discovery; and the university&#x27;s growing presence in New York City as a source of opportunity. Garrett said that the recruitment, development and retention of the best faculty remained Cornell University&#x27;s paramount priorities. She also spoke of focusing on the residential undergraduate experience, defining as a community the shared intellectual experience all Cornell students should encounter. And she pointed to the opportunities inherent in the university&#x27;s dual footprint, in Ithaca and New York City, urging all of Cornell&#x27;s colleges to connect with Cornell Tech in new collaborations.

Following the ceremony, the university hosted a picnic on the Agriculture Quadrangle, inviting Ithaca citizens as well as the campus community. The Cornell Dairy prepared 450 gallons of its newest ice cream flavor, 24 Garrett Swirl. Later in the day, Garrett moderated a panel on democracy and inequality in Bailey Hall, bringing together eminent faculty to explore how inequality interacts with immigration, access to education and health care, job creation and economic opportunity.

====Tenure at Cornell University ====
Although she served as Cornell&#x27;s president for 7 months, Garrett was popular with students and actively involved in campus issues, working to ameliorate housing problems for graduate students, approving the opening of Anabel&#x27;s Grocery store, rearranging administrative leadership and defending freedom of speech on campus.

Several of Garrett&#x27;s decisions also sparked controversy, including her reversal of President Emeritus David Skorton’s 2035 carbon neutrality goal and the January 2016 decision to form the College of Business. Many members of the Cornell community, including students, faculty and alumni, criticized Garrett’s decisions and the lack of transparency in the administration&#x27;s decision-making.

Garrett also emphasized the importance of supporting every Cornell constituency and often expressed her support for students and faculty. At her State of the University address on October 23, 2015, Garrett said that Cornell University &quot;students are simply amazing.&quot; She also said that it is important to provide ample support for students so that they can both contribute to and gain from their academic experience.

==Death==

Garrett died on March 6, 2016, from colon cancer at her New York City home at the age of 52. She was the first Cornell president to die while in office.
Garrett first shared her cancer diagnosis with the Cornell University community February 8, 2016, in a statement. She underwent surgery February 19, 2016, and officially delegated the duties and powers of the presidency to Provost Michael Kotlikoff, as provided by the Cornell University Bylaws. On February 22, 2016, acting president Michael Kotlikoff announced that she had been released from the intensive care unit and would continue treatment under the care of doctors at Weill Cornell Medicine.

The Cornell community gathered across campus in the late afternoon of March 7, 2016, to pay their respects to Garrett. More than a thousand university leaders, students, faculty, staff and local community members met on the Cornell Arts Quadrangle, the same ground that fewer than six months earlier saw the celebration of Garrett&#x27;s inauguration.

On the evening of March 8, 2016, hundreds of students gathered in front of Willard Straight Hall to honor Garrett with a candlelight vigil. Several speakers shared their memories of Garrett and how she had influenced them. Before and after the vigil, students signed a card for Garrett&#x27;s family.

Before her untimely death, Garrett expressed her desire to create a fund at Weill Cornell Medicine to advance research in colon cancer. On March 8, 2016, Dr. Laurie Glimcher, the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine, announced the launch of the President Elizabeth Garrett Fund for Colon Cancer Research.

A memorial gathering was held in Bailey Hall on March 17, 2016.

Garrett was survived by her husband, Israeli legal philosopher Andrei Marmor, the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Philosophy and Law at Cornell University; her parents, Robert and Jane Garrett; and a sister, Laura Garrett.

==Personal life==

During her tenure at the University of Chicago Law School, Garrett started dating Andrei Marmor, and they got married soon after. Matthew Spitzer, dean of USC Gould School of Law at the time, coincidentally attempted to recruit both Garrett and Marmor independently to come to USC before they met. Soon after they decided to get married, Garrett and Marmor accepted USC&#x27;s offers. She and her husband enjoyed traveling together, and most recently visited Cambodia, Vietnam, and Italy before her death in 2016.

One of Garrett&#x27;s hobbies was cross-stitching. In her USC office, Garrett covered her walls in cross-stitched state mottos and landscapes of Jerusalem, Chicago, and the Netherlands. She would send cross-stitched works to her family and friends. Her college friend, Mike Bresson said he remembered traveling through Italy with Garrett and a group of others, and while everyone else slept, she cross-stitched, never to waste a moment.

<text>Eugenie Anderson (May 26, 1909 – March 31, 1997), also known as Helen Eugenie Moore Anderson, was a United States diplomat. She is best known as the first woman appointed chief of mission at the ambassador level in US history.

==Personal life==
Helen Eugenie Moore was born on May 26, 1909, in Adair, Iowa, one of five children of Rev. Ezekial A. Moore, a Methodist minister, and his wife, FloraBelle. She concentrated in music as a student and attended the Juilliard School in New York; her original hope was to become a concert pianist. She was a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of Pi Beta Phi Women&#x27;s Fraternity at Simpson College. She transferred to Carleton College in 1929, where she graduated in 1931. It was there she met her husband, John Pierce Anderson, whom she married in 1929 and with whom she had two children, Hans and Johanna.

==Public life==
Anderson&#x27;s interest in international affairs had been stirred by a trip to Europe in 1937, where in Germany she first saw a &quot;totalitarian state in action,&quot; as she recalled. On her return she spoke frequently for the League of Women Voters, fighting the strong isolationist policies of the time.

Anderson helped to create the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in 1944. Four years later, as one of the few women, she was elected to an office in the national Democratic Party. In 1948, as the DFL split from the national Democratic Party in a controversy over goals and ideology, she supported Hubert H. Humphrey. She was rewarded for this support in 1949, when she was appointed by President Truman as U.S. ambassador to Denmark (1949–1953). 

Truman&#x27;s appointment made her the first woman appointed chief of mission at the ambassador level in US history. (The first female chief of mission at the minister rank was Ruth Bryan Owen in 1933). Despite undercurrents of sexism and discomfort in the press with her career flaunting gender roles, she was well-known in Denmark and was sometimes called &quot;Auntie Anderson&quot; by the media. Anderson was a strong proponent for people&#x27;s diplomacy, or public diplomacy. For example, immediately after she presented her credentials to King Frederik, she invited the workers who furnished her official residence and their families to a house-warming party. Anderson also learned and spoke publicly in Danish which was unusual as such language skills were not seen as necessary at the time. Her popularity and high profile allowed her to exert some political force: she convinced Denmark to make a stronger commitment to NATO, strengthened the Greenland Treaty, and in 1950 became the first American woman to sign a treaty, with the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship with Denmark, which she drafted. When she resigned from this position in 1953, King Frederik IX awarded her the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog, a high honor.

In 1958 Anderson campaigned for, but did not win, the DFL nomination for U.S. Senator, which ultimately went to Eugene McCarthy. She was later appointed by Kennedy to be ambassador to Bulgaria (1962–1964). Thus, Anderson became the first American woman to represent the United States in a country allied with the Soviet Union. She was also the first American diplomat to speak on Bulgarian television and radio. While ambassador to Bulgaria, Anderson negotiated the settlement of outstanding Bulgarian debts to the US from World War II.

After her retirement from these posts, President Johnson appointed Anderson member of the US delegation to the United Nations, serving on the Trusteeship Council and the Security Council. Anderson was the first woman to sit on the UN&#x27;s Security Council. A year later in 1966, she served on the United Nations Committee for Decolonization, which supported newly independent countries in Africa and Asia. In 1968, Anderson was briefly engaged as Special Assistant to the Secretary.

== Retirement and death ==
Anderson retired from the State Department in September of 1968. She continued to work for Humphrey&#x27;s political campaigns. Anderson died in Red Wing, Minnesota at the age of 87.

<text>Forrest Howard Anderson (January 30, 1913 – July 20, 1989) was an American politician, attorney, and judge who served as the 17th Governor of Montana from 1969 to 1973. Prior to this, he served as the Attorney General of Montana from 1957 to 1969 and as a member of the Montana Supreme Court.

==Biography==
Anderson was born in Helena, Montana. His father, Oscar Anderson, was an immigrant from Sweden and his mother, Mary O&#x27;Keefe, was an Irish immigrant. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Montana and obtained his law degree from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. He was admitted to the practice of law in 1938. He married Margaret Evelyn Samson on January 24, 1941, and they had three children.

==Career==
Anderson was a Democrat. He served in the Montana House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He was a Lewis and Clark County Attorney from 1945 to 1947. He was also an Associate Justice on the Montana Supreme Court from 1953 to 1957, a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention, and served three terms as Montana Attorney General from 1957 to 1968.

As Attorney General, he came to prominence during the 1959 State Prison riot, when he personally negotiated with the prisoners. Running for Governor in 1968 he defeated the incumbent, Governor Tim Babcock, largely on an anti-sales tax platform notable for the campaign slogan, &quot;Pay More, What For?&quot;

Elected as Governor of Montana in 1968, Anderson was sworn in on January 6, 1969, and served until January 1, 1973. In his influential and controversial single term in office, he considered his greatest accomplishment to be the reorganization of the executive branch: he oversaw the consolidation of 161 state agencies, boards, commissions and councils into 19 departments. He chaired the bipartisan Montana Commission on Executive Reorganization, which drafted the constitutional amendment to reduce the number of executive agencies. In the 1970 election, voters approved the amendment by a 70-percent margin. The reorganization effort faced opposition from the many boards slated to be dissolved. However, the legislature passed the necessary legislation by the last day of the 1971 session. Anderson called a special legislative session to finalize the details of implementation. On March 10, 1971, he signed the Executive Reorganization Law.

The controversies he faced as governor included a major dispute with the Fish and Game Commission and its commissioner, Frank Dunkle, over environmental issues and sportsmen&#x27;s access to state lands. The biggest political clash he faced occurred in 1971, when the Montana Legislature debated a sales tax. When the Legislature deadlocked, Anderson called them back into special session twice, and finally the issue was put to a ballot referendum, where it was soundly rejected. During his tenure, another major accomplishment was his establishment of the Board of Investments, which was able to remove state funds from low yield bank accounts and invest them in higher yield accounts.

Anderson strongly supported and authorized the 1972 Constitutional Convention, then helped facilitate its implementation after it was ratified that year. Anderson anticipated that opponents of the new constitution would challenge it in the Montana Supreme Court, and he had his legal counsel prepare the proclamation of ratification while the Board of Elections commissioners were still tallying the votes. Secretary of State Frank Murray tried to delay the proclamation on a technicality, saying that he did not see Anderson sign it. Anderson responded sarcastically, &quot;Frank, I&#x27;m going to sign this again. Frank, are you watching me? I&#x27;m writing, Frank. Now, Mr. Secretary of State, attest to my approval of this document; this is your legal duty.&quot; The 1972 constitution overcame legal challenges and remains in place today.

Anderson&#x27;s critics accused him of making backroom deals for his own profit throughout his political career. They pointed to a real estate deal he made during his term as attorney general. Anderson bought property on Holter Lake from the Montana Power Company for $1,800, and later sold it for more than $30,000.

==Later life==
Anderson did not run for a second term because of poor health, and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, Tom Judge. In 1973 and 1974, he served on a regional economic commission. However, further public service became impossible as his health deteriorated. An operation to correct his hiatal hernia failed. In constant pain from an intestinal condition and forced to live on liquids, Anderson retired in 1974.

In 1989, Anderson, who had been in failing health for years, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home. He was cremated and his ashes are interred in Forestvale Cemetery, Helena, Lewis and Clark County, Montana. The Forrest H. Anderson Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River in Craig is named in his honor. There is a marker at near Craig close to the river and highway bridge which memorializes Anderson and his passion for fishing and hunting.

<text>William Anderson VC (28 December 1882 – 13 March 1915) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was posthumously awarded the VC during the First World War for his actions during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Dallas, Moray in Scotland on 28 December 1882 to Alexander and Bella Anderson. The family later moved to Forres, where he was educated at Forres Academy. After completing his education, he moved to Glasgow and was employed as a car conductor with the Corporation Tramways for several years.

In 1905, Anderson enlisted in the British Army, joining the 2nd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, also known as the Green Howards, for a seven-year period of service; his brother James was already serving with the battalion. William would spend time in Egypt, South Africa, and British India, on the North West Frontier. After his period of service ended, Anderson returned to Glasgow and was employed in the Elder Hospital in Govan. By this stage, he was engaged and planned to emigrate to South Africa.

==First World War==
Anderson was still living in England, having not yet completed his move to South Africa, when the First World War broke out. As he was a reservist, he was soon called up to the British Army. In November 1914, he rejoined the 2nd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, the battalion that he had previously served with, which was now on the Western Front in France as part of the 7th Division. By this stage, he was an acting corporal.

In March 1915, the 7th Division was involved in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. It entered the fighting on 11 March, during which time Anderson was one of a group of men involved in a bombing raid. He was involved in another bombing raid the next day, when his company tried to retake ground lost to the Germans the previous day. It was for this action that he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read as follows:
His VC award was gazetted in May 1915, but by then Anderson was dead, having been killed in action on 13 March 1915. His remains were never found, and he is commemorated on the Le Touret Memorial.

==Medal==
As Anderson&#x27;s parents were deceased, his brother Alexander was presented with Anderson&#x27;s VC by Lieutenant General Francis Davies, the former commander of the 7th Division, in a ceremony at Edinburgh Castle on 19 May 1920. Several years later, the VC was donated to the Green Howards Regimental Museum in Richmond, Yorkshire. He is remembered on the Forres War Memorial and on 15 March 2015, a commemorative tablet in Anderson&#x27;s honour was laid at the war memorial at Dallas, where he was born.

==Early life and education==
Blackwell was born in Alliance, Ohio, the son of Dana, a part-time nurse, and George Blackwell, a meatpacker. He has two brothers, Carl and Charles. He married his wife Rosa in 1969 while he was in college. They have three children, Kimberly, Rahshann, and Kristin.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Xavier in 1970 and his Master of Education degree, also from Xavier, in 1971. After college, he was invited to the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; training camp; he gave up football when told he would have to convert from linebacker to offensive lineman. He taught at Xavier from 1974 to 1991.

He has served as a trustee of Wilberforce University and Wilmington College. On April 25, 1987, Kenneth Blackwell was made a Mason-on-Sight by Grand Master Odes J. Kyle Jr. of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Ohio; thereby making him a Prince Hall Freemason. This African-American branch of Freemasonry was founded in the 19th century.

==Political career==
Blackwell became involved in politics through the Charter Committee, Cincinnati&#x27;s third party. He was elected to and served on the Cincinnati city council.

In 1978, he was elected as Mayor of Cincinnati, serving into 1980. One of his first priorities was to establish a crowd control task force, to study better methods of crowd control and injury prevention. This was in response to the deaths of 11 concert fans at a concert by the British rock group The Who at Riverfront Coliseum on December 3, 1979.

Blackwell is a member of the Council For National Policy formed in 1981 and as of 2022 is Vice-President of the Executive Committee of the CNP.

When Blackwell began to consider statewide and national offices, he became a Republican. He was appointed to serve in the administration of President George H. W. Bush, as undersecretary in the Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1989 to 1990. He returned to Cincinnati to run for the first district seat in the United States House of Representatives which was being vacated by Tom Luken. Blackwell lost to Luken&#x27;s son, Charlie Luken, by a narrow 51% to 49% margin. Following his close defeat, Blackwell was appointed by President Bush as US ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Blackwell served in that post from 1992 to 1993.

In 1994 Gov. George Voinovich appointed Blackwell as Ohio State Treasurer to complete the term of Mary Ellen Withrow. She had been appointed as U.S. treasurer by President Bill Clinton. Blackwell was elected treasurer in 1994 and was elected Ohio Secretary of State in 1998. That year, Blackwell considered a run for governor, but Ohio Republican Party chairman Robert T. Bennett persuaded Blackwell to run for secretary of state instead, leaving the governorship open to Bob Taft. Blackwell was national chairman of longtime friend Steve Forbes&#x27; presidential campaign in 2000. Blackwell was re-elected secretary of state in 2002.

==Ohio Secretary of State==

===Involvement in the 2004 U.S. presidential election===
As Secretary of State of a hotly contested swing state, Blackwell played a prominent role in the 2004 United States elections. He held the position of &quot;Chief Elections Officer&quot;, overseeing Ohio&#x27;s elections process.

In testifying to Congress in 2005 about the conduct of the 2004 election in Ohio, Blackwell said that every Republican holder of statewide office in Ohio had been named as an honorary &quot;co-chair&quot; of the 2004 Bush campaign, that the position carried no responsibilities, and that previous Ohio Secretaries of State from both parties had held similar honorary positions.

Prior to the 2004 presidential election, Blackwell had announced he would enforce an Ohio State election law decreeing that any person who appeared at a polling place to vote but whose registration could not be confirmed would be given only a provisional ballot; if it were later determined that the person had attempted to vote in the wrong precinct, then their provisional ballot would not be counted. He directed poll workers to refuse to distribute provisional ballots unless they were satisfied as to the voter&#x27;s residence. The Democratic party filed a lawsuit claiming that the policy was &quot;intended to disenfranchise minority voters&quot; and in violation of federal election law, specifically section 302 of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).

On October 21, 2004, U.S. District Court Judge James G. Carr issued an order rejecting Blackwell&#x27;s policy. Blackwell said that he would go to jail rather than comply. Blackwell appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On October 26, 2004, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed in part and reversed in part.

The court agreed with the plaintiffs and the District Court that Blackwell&#x27;s directive violated HAVA to the extent that it empowered poll workers to withhold a provisional ballot based on their &quot;on-the-spot determination at the polling place.&quot; The court ruled that if a subsequent review concluded that the voter was not entitled to vote in that precinct, then the provisional ballot would not be counted. (pdf) (pdf) In accordance with the Court of Appeals ruling, provisional ballots cast in the wrong precincts were not counted in Ohio&#x27;s 2004 elections.

Democratic members of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary asked Blackwell to explain irregularities in the Ohio election in two letters, (pdf) (pdf) and requested his presence at a Public Congressional Hearing. (pdf) He did not attend the hearing, but responded to the first letter, refusing to comply with their requests for explanation, noting that he was already responding to requests from the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Justice. (pdf)

On December 27, 2004, Blackwell requested a court order to protect him from being interviewed in the &quot;Moss v. Bush&quot; case, a challenge of the presidential vote. He fought a subpoena, arguing that the litigation was frivolous.

A report written by the ranking House Judiciary Committee member John Conyers stated: 

===Release of Ohio Social Security numbers===
On March 1, 2006, Blackwell&#x27;s office accidentally published a list of 1.2 million Social Security numbers of Ohio citizens on a website along with their business filings. A Federal class-action lawsuit was filed by Darrell Estep, who claimed that the release of the data had resulted in his Social Security number appearing three times on the public website. The lawsuit was settled on March 28, 2006, after the numbers were removed from the website, a registration process was enacted to view the data, and Blackwell&#x27;s office agreed to make monthly progress reports to the court. The data was part of a centralized voter database, required by Federal law. At that time, Blackwell promised to retain only the last four digits of the Social Security number in the database to prevent future problems.

But on April 26, 2006, Blackwell&#x27;s office disclosed Ohio Social Security numbers again, mailing out computer disks containing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of 5.7 million registered voters in Ohio (80% of all registered voters in the state). The list was released as a standard practice under the Freedom of Information Act and Help America Vote Act. Blackwell&#x27;s office apologized, saying that the release of the Social Security numbers was accidental and it attempted to recall all 20 of the disks. At least one recipient of the disks refused to comply.

Jim Petro, then Republican Attorney General of Ohio, launched an investigation into the disclosure, citing a legal requirement to &quot;investigate any state entity where there may be a risk of a loss of private data.&quot; Blackwell stated that he considered the issue to be closed, but Petro disagreed, saying that he would use &quot;maximum due diligence&quot; to ensure that the data was not copied before it was returned. Ohio law requires that individuals be notified if their Social Security numbers are compromised.

===Diebold controversies===
Ohio State Senator Jeff Jacobson asked Blackwell in July 2003 to disqualify Diebold Election Systems&#x27; bid to supply voting machines for the state, after security problems were discovered in its software.

On April 4, 2006, the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; reported that Blackwell &quot;owned stock [83 shares, down from 178 shares purchased in January 2005] in Diebold, a voting-machine [and ATM] manufacturer, at the same time his office negotiated a &quot;deal&quot; with the company. After discovering the stock ownership, Blackwell promptly sold the shares at a loss. He attributed the purchase to an unidentified financial manager at Credit Suisse First Boston who he said had, without his knowledge, violated his instructions to avoid potential conflict of interest.

When Cuyahoga County&#x27;s primary was held on May 2, 2006, officials ordered the hand-counting of more than 18,000 paper ballots after Diebold&#x27;s new optical scan machines produced inconsistent tabulations. The results of several local races were in limbo for days and eventually the recount resulted in a reversal of the outcome of one race for state representative. Blackwell ordered an investigation by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; Ohio Democrats demanded that Blackwell, due to his prior role in acquiring the Diebold equipment as well as his status as the Republican gubernatorial candidate in this election, recuse himself from the investigation due to conflicts of interest, but Blackwell did not do so.

==2006 Ohio gubernatorial campaign==

===Campaign and national significance===
Blackwell was the Republican nominee for Governor of Ohio in 2006. He beat state Attorney General Jim Petro in the 2006 Republican primary. (The current governor, Republican Bob Taft, could not run because of term limits.) Blackwell&#x27;s opponents in the general election were Democratic Congressman Ted Strickland, Libertarian professor emeritus Bill Peirce, and Green Bob Fitrakis. Blackwell chose Ohio State Representative Tom Raga to be his running mate. Blackwell was the first African American to be nominated by a major political party as a candidate for the Ohio governorship.

There had been increased national attention on the ability of the Republican party to maintain control in Ohio. On a national level, &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the results of the election would be a bellwether for the 2008 US presidential election.

Blackwell faced an uphill battle; according to a broad survey reported by &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; on April 30, 2006, Ohio voters would &quot;prefer to see a Democrat occupy the governor&#x27;s mansion.&quot; Still, he had his supporters. John Stemberger, president and general counsel for the Florida Family Policy Council, was quoted as saying that Blackwell could &quot;potentially be president of the United States someday, and the first black president at that.&quot; Blackwell&#x27;s campaign relied heavily on accusations that Ted Strickland was not a resident of Ohio, and later that Ted Strickland was gay. Both of these accusations played heavily in campaign literature that failed to resonate with Ohio voters. Due to his poor management of this campaign, Blackwell&#x27;s ability to compete on a national stage was called into question.

On November 7, 2006, Ted Strickland was elected Governor, defeating Blackwell by a 24% margin.

===Conservative platform===
Blackwell has taken some very conservative positions. In 2005, he supported keeping Terri Schiavo on life support indefinitely, saying, &quot;I really do think that life is sacred, no matter how painful.&quot; When asked on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; if he would keep Schiavo on life support for 30 years, Blackwell said he would.

In his 2002 campaign for re-election to the post of Secretary of State, Blackwell took the position that he would favor abortions in the case where the life of the mother was at stake. He has since taken a more conservative position of opposing abortions even in the case where the mother&#x27;s life is at risk.

===May 2 primary===
Blackwell won the Republican Primary on May 2, 2006, against Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro with 56% of the vote. The run up to the primaries was dominated by strongly critical television ads that Blackwell and his opponent Jim Petro ran against one another.

Blackwell was criticized by Petro, for declining to engage in three planned debates which had been organized by the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; and the City Club of Cleveland. The debate at the City Club of Cleveland occurred on April 25, 2006, despite Blackwell&#x27;s absence. The event was originally scheduled to be broadcast on public television around Ohio. According to &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;, &quot;Blackwell said he has &#x27;shared plenty of forums&#x27; with Petro and that he wants to focus on talking to Republicans in the final days of the campaign.&quot;

On April 29, the Hamilton County Democrats publicly demanded that Blackwell pull radio ads which urged unregistered Democrats to ask for Republican primary ballots on May 2, 2006 (rather than the issues-only ballot that unregistered voters normally get), and thereby become registered Republicans. The Democrats argued that the ads are using &quot;illegal and unethical political tactics.&quot;

===Campaign finance===
During the primary, Blackwell led the Republican candidates in his ability to raise significant amounts of money for his campaign. He raised $1.09 million between January 31, 2006, and April 12, 2006, from approximately 12,000 individuals and businesses. This was nearly $800,000 more than his main competition, Jim Petro, but less than the $1.1 million raised by his main Democratic competition, Ted Strickland. Blackwell, along with 14 other candidates, (including Petro and Strickland) were accused by the Ohio Citizen Action group of failing to meet Ohio&#x27;s campaign contribution law which requires best efforts to disclose the names, addresses, employment status, employer, and place of employment of individuals who donate $100 or more to a political campaign. Blackwell, Petro, and Strickland all received a &quot;B letter grade&quot; from the group for their levels of disclosure.

On April 16, 2006, the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; reported that Blackwell had accepted more than $1 million in campaign contributions from &quot;employees of firms seeking business with the statewide offices he&#x27;s held over the past 12 years.&quot; Furthermore, the same organizations donated $1.34 million to the Ohio Republican Party, $1.29 million of which was forwarded directly to Blackwell&#x27;s campaign fund. Several of the firms which have been awarded contracts from Blackwell&#x27;s office have also been hired on to his gubernatorial campaign. The investigators argue that the suggestion of &quot;quid pro quo&quot; based on the actions of contributors raise an issue of a serious conflict of interest. Petro has responded by demanding that a law which bans political contributors from being awarded state contracts. Blackwell has stated that no illegal activity took place. In response to Petro&#x27;s call for reform, Blackwell stated: &quot;If you are asking me ... &#x27;Am I advocating for campaign spending limits?&#x27; No. Never have. Never will.&quot;

After winning their respective primaries, both Blackwell and his Democratic opponent were able to raise record sums, in part because of the national attention paid to the race. As of September 9, 2006, Strickland led Blackwell, $11.2 million to $10 million.

===Support from religious groups===
Blackwell was well supported by many religious leaders in Ohio both politically and financially; according to campaign filings, Blackwell had received $25,031 from clergy, more than 27 times as much as Strickland.

However, on January 16, 2006, a group of 31 pastors, led by Rev. Eric Williams, pastor of North Congregational Church (United Church of Christ) in Columbus, Ohio wrote a 13-page letter to the IRS alleging that Blackwell has enjoyed &quot;special treatment&quot; by two Ohio &quot;mega-churches,&quot; World Harvest Church and Fairfield Christian Church. The pastors accused the two organizations of sponsoring at least nine events with Blackwell as the sole invited politician, described as &quot;partisan voter-registration drives,&quot; and of distributing biased voting guides. Rev. Russell Johnson, pastor of the Fairfield Christian Church in Lancaster, Ohio, defended his actions by saying that the event in question was not a &quot;meet the candidate forum,&quot; but rather that he was giving Blackwell &quot;an award for courageous leadership.&quot; Blackwell later called the group of 31 pastors &quot;bullies.&quot;

On April 19, 2006, e-mails sent on behalf of the Blackwell campaign by Rev. Johnson on Easter Sunday, April 16, 2006, were reported by &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. Both the Blackwell campaign and Johnson, on behalf of Fairfield Christian Church, denied all wrongdoing. The e-mails in question subsequently were publicized on various online media outlets, clearly showing that the e-mails had been sent from within Johnson&#x27;s church office on the evening of Easter Sunday to Church personnel and employees of the church-owned Fairfield Christian Academy.

As the two churches are 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, not-for-profit organizations, they are explicitly barred from campaigning for, endorsing candidates or &quot;becoming involved in any activity which is beneficial or harmful to any candidate.&quot; Johnson and Rev. Rod Parsley, pastor of World Harvest church, have argued that the investigation was politically motivated and violated their constitutional right to free speech. Mark Everson, commissioner of the IRS responded, &quot;you don&#x27;t have an automatic or constitutional right to a tax exemption, and that&#x27;s where the line has been drawn.&quot;

On May 7, 2006, the members of the Lord of Life Lutheran church in Columbus, Ohio, publicly complained that Blackwell&#x27;s campaign workers placed fliers on the windshields of persons attending the church service on April 30, two days before the May 2 primary. The church pastor, Rev. Jim Wilson, stated &quot;the tactic was offensive and suggested the church was endorsing Blackwell.&quot; Wilson said that he had tried to contact the Blackwell campaign in response to the incident but did not get a &quot;satisfactory response.&quot; When questioned, Blackwell&#x27;s campaign said the practice was &quot;standard ... for Republicans and Democrats.&quot;

On May 14, 2007, Blackwell was appointed a senior fellow at the well-known conservative religious, political group Family Research Council.

===Support from pro-gun organizations===
Blackwell has earned an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. He is a member of the NRA&#x27;s Board of Directors. Blackwell is also endorsed by the Ohio Gun Collectors Association, Ohioans for Concealed Carry and Gun Owners of America.

&quot;I unequivocally support the Second Amendment right of every law-abiding Ohioan to keep and own firearms for hunting, personal protection and any other lawful purpose,&quot; said Blackwell. &quot;I am proud to receive the NRA&#x27;s highest rating and will be an unflinching advocate for gun owners as governor.&quot;

===Bonuses===
After Blackwell left office as Secretary of State, an audit found that he had awarded $80,534 in illegal bonuses to 17 employees. 

==RNC Chairman Election==
Blackwell announced his intentions to run in the 2009 RNC Chairmanship Election, but withdrew after the 4th round of voting. He won early endorsement from the state chairmen in Louisiana (Roger F. Villere, Jr.), Texas (Tina Benkiser), and Oklahoma (Gary Jones).

==Association with Family Research Council (FRC)==

Family Research Council identifies Blackwell as a Senior Fellow for Family Empowerment. According to the organization&#x27;s 2010 form 990 filing with the Internal Revenue Service, Blackwell was paid $162,000 as an independent contractor.

==National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA)==
In October 2011, the National Federation of Republican Assemblies elected Blackwell their Executive Vice President at their Des Moines, Iowa Presidential Preference Convention. Blackwell was re-elected in September 2013.

==Involvement in Trump transition==
During the presidential transition of Donald Trump, Blackwell led appointment selections for positions involving domestic issues.

<doc id="769598" wikidata="Q1300359" url="?curid=769598" title="William French Anderson">
<text>William French Anderson (born December 31, 1936) is an American physician, geneticist and molecular biologist. He is known as the &quot;father of gene therapy&quot;. He graduated from Harvard College in 1958, Trinity College, Cambridge University (England) in 1960, and from Harvard Medical School in 1963. In 1990 he was the first person to succeed in carrying out gene therapy by treating a 4-year-old girl suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency (a disorder called &quot;bubble boy disease&quot;). 

==Early life and education==
Anderson was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to his two parents. His father was a civil engineer, his mother was a journalist and writer, and he had two older sisters. He had a very happy childhood. He was recognized in high school for his scholarship, interest in science, and prowess on the track team. He won an Honorable Mention in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search for a project demonstrating how Roman numerals could be used in arithmetical procedures. He graduated in 1954 from Tulsa Central High School.

Anderson went to Harvard College, where he published several papers as an undergraduate: his high school work on Roman numerals in classical philology in 1956, arithmetical operations using Minoan linear B numerals in the &quot;American Journal of Archaeology&quot; in 1958, a physical chemistry research paper in the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; in 1958, and a research study on the effects of irradiation on DNA in the &quot;Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology&quot; in 1961. In its March 19, 1956 issue, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Anderson a &quot;Harvard Prodigy&quot; for his research work on ancient numerical systems. He graduated from Harvard in 1958, and spent two years at Trinity College, Cambridge University (England), where he obtained an M.A., worked in the laboratory of Francis Crick, won a Full Blue on the track team, and met, and in 1961 married Kathy, who was a fellow medical student at Cambridge.

He returned to Harvard, to the medical school, and was joined there by Kathy a year later. Anderson graduated in 1963 and spent a year internship in pediatric medicine at Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. His wife graduated in 1964 and went on to have a very distinguished career in pediatric surgery. Anderson, after his intern year, spent a year conducting bacterial genetics research at Harvard Medical School and published his work in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA&quot; in 1965.

==Career==
Anderson then spent two years, 1965–1967, under the tutelage of Marshall Nirenberg in a laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, where he helped finish the decipherment of the genetic code. Nirenberg rewarded his efforts by allowing him to make the first public presentation of the final genetic code before an audience of approximately 2,000 scientists at the April 1966 meeting of FASEB in Atlantic City. After his successful post-doctoral fellowship with Nirenberg, Anderson was given his own laboratory in the NIH in July 1967. He made clear from the beginning that his goal was to develop a way to give a normal gene to children with a genetic defect in order to cure the genetic disease. He, therefore, decided to begin by studying human disease on the molecular level. Over his career, he has published more than 400 research papers, 39 editorials, and 5 books, and has received numerous awards and honors including 5 honorary doctorate degrees.

=== Discovery of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factors ===
As Anderson began his own career, protein synthesis in bacteria was at the forefront of molecular biology research. He set out to discover protein synthesis initiation factors in mammals. His first major accomplishment, in 1970, was the isolation from rabbit reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) of several factors that initiated hemoglobin synthesis on reticulocyte ribosomes. It was later learned that these factors also initiated protein synthesis in essentially all eukaryotic systems.

=== Development of a cell-free protein synthesizing system ===
In order to isolate the predicted molecule &quot;messenger RNA&quot;, a cell-free protein synthesizing system of mRNA-free ribosomes was needed. Initially, a cell-free tRNA-dependent protein synthesizing system was developed from rabbit reticulocytes ribosomes, using the endogenous mRNA on the ribosomes. An analogous system was developed with human reticulocyte ribosomes.

=== Isolation of human messenger RNA ===
A procedure was developed for stripping the putative mRNA from the ribosomes. This ribosomal wash from rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes was incubated in a cell-free system and rabbit hemoglobin was produced. The procedure for stripping endogenous mRNA from rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes was used on human reticulocyte ribosomes to obtain human globin mRNA.

=== Synthesis of normal and mutant globin proteins using human globin mRNA ===
Stripped rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes were programmed with mRNA isolated from thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or normal human reticulocytes. The rabbit ribosome cell-free system was able to produce normal human globin from normal human mRNA, sickle cell globin from sickle cell mRNA, and the abnormal alpha/beta globin chain abnormality of thalassemia from thalassemia mRNA.

=== Microinjection of globin DNA into mammalian cell nuclei ===
As a first approach for developing a human gene therapy procedure, standard microinjection techniques were modified to permit the injection of DNA plasmids into the nucleus of mammalian cells. Human globin genes were microinjected into mouse fibroblasts and into mouse oocytes and shown to express human globin mRNA.

=== Development of retroviral gene therapy vectors ===
Microinjecting a few non-stem cells was clearly not an efficient procedure for a clinical protocol. In 1984, Anderson published a major review in &quot;Science&quot; in which he analyzed the &quot;Prospects for Human Gene Therapy&quot; and concluded that the most promising approach was to use retroviral vectors as a delivery vehicle. He immediately established a close, long-term collaboration with one of the top retroviral vector scientists: Eli Gilboa, then at Princeton. Together they developed vectors that could efficiently carry a gene package into mouse or human cells in culture.

The most efficient vector, N2, carrying a neomycin resistance gene, was used to transduce mouse bone marrow cells. The N2-transduced cells were injected into lethally irradiated mice where they repopulated the marrow. The presence and expression of the N2 vector could be detected in the repopulated mouse bone marrow cells by testing for the resistance of the marrow cells to the toxic antibiotic neomycin.

Once the procedure was working successfully in mice, successful studies were done in non human primates. In addition, extensive safety studies were done in the vector transduced animals.

=== Successful gene therapy of a human patient ===
Attempting to perform gene therapy by inserting recombinant DNA into a human being was extremely controversial after an illegal attempt was made in 1980. Anderson, together with bioethicist John Fletcher, set the ethical standard for this type of clinical protocol in his 1980 article in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; entitled: &quot;Gene Therapy In Human Beings: When Is It Ethical To Begin?&quot; An extensive regulatory process was established during the late 1980s, including the creation of the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee as a first round of regulatory oversight. Only after approval by that formal public governmental review did the gene therapy clinical protocol move on for review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), the FDA, and other ethics/regulatory committees. The media followed every step closely.

Anderson teamed with Michael Blaese, a prominent immunologist in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and Steven Rosenberg, a prominent cancer surgeon and immunotherapy advocate, also in the NCI. The initial protocol was a safety study where only the N2 vector, previously shown to be safe when used in non-human primates, was administered to cancer patients, on Rosenberg&#x27;s NCI clinical cancer service, who volunteered for the study. A full &quot;gene therapy&quot; regulatory review was carried out. The clinical protocol began on May 22, 1989, and included 10 patients. The procedure was shown to be safe. Rosenberg went on to develop gene therapy/immunotherapy clinical protocols for cancer.

Anderson and Blaese carried out the first gene therapy protocol, on a 4-year-old girl, named Ashanthi DeSilva, who was critically ill with adenosine deaminase deficiency severe combined immunodeficiency disease (ADA SCID). Preliminary studies included development of a retroviral vector containing the ADA gene together with additional safety features, creation of ADA deficient human T cell lines used for testing ADA vectors, and creation of a biotechnology company, Genetic Therapy Inc., to manufacture the ADA vector, called LASN, under strict GMP FDA requirements. Anderson also created, and became editor-in-chief of, a new journal, Human Gene Therapy, in 1990. This new journal published not only original scientific research papers but also articles on ethical and regulatory issues relating to gene therapy.

Ashanthi received her first infusion of cells on September 14, 1990, with no complications. She received 10 more infusions over the next 2 years. Her immune evaluation studies became normal and she became healthy with no major infections. A thorough immune status follow-up was done after 12 years: she remained healthy with 20% of her lymphocytes still carrying an active retroviral ADA gene – a sufficient percentage to ensure immunologic protection. She is now 33 years old, married, and works as a journalist and writer.

=== Late career research projects ===
In 1992, Anderson followed his wife to Los Angeles, where she accepted the position of chief of surgery at Los Angeles Children&#x27;s Hospital. He became professor of biochemistry and pediatrics at the University of Southern California (USC). Anderson maintained his intense interest in gene therapy and was able to develop a retroviral gene therapy vector that could target the collagen matrix surrounding cancer nodules. He wrote a number of reviews of gene therapy in both the scientific literature and in the popular literature.

Anticipating the value of lab-on-a-chip technology for the molecular analysis of individual cells, Anderson joined forces with Stephen Quake, professor of applied physics at California Institute of Technology. Quake was developing lab-on-a-chip technology using soft polymers. Anderson became a visiting associate in applied physics at Caltech from 2001 to 2006, while maintaining his USC positions, and succeeded in developing an improved microfluidic valve that was patented and has become the core of soft polymer lab-on-a-chip devices.

His final project before he was arrested was the discovery and identification of a factor in the serum of irradiated animals that could rescue lethally irradiated animals even 24 hours after the irradiation. Purification from the serum demonstrated that the factor was Interleukin 12. During the 12 years that Anderson has been in prison, IL-12 has been shown to potentially be a very important adjuvant drug in cancer treatment.

== Other activities ==
=== Sports medicine ===
Anderson has been a ring doctor and tournament doctor in a large number of competitions. In 1981, he became the team physician for the National Taekwondo Team, and was also the team physician at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul Korea when taekwondo became an Olympic sport. He has written several sports medicine articles on prevention and treatment of taekwondo injuries. In addition, he was chairman of the medical committee of the World Taekwondo Federation from 1985 to 1988.

=== Forensic medicine ===
Anderson is best known in forensic medicine for his forensic analysis of the famous April 11, 1986 FBI firefight which, at the time, was the deadliest firefight in the history of the FBI. His analysis, privately printed in 1996, was accepted by the FBI as the official version, and every new FBI agent was given a copy of his report. After 10 years, the FBI allowed Anderson to make the report public, and it was published with a new foreword by Paladin Press in 2006.

Anderson also published a forensic analysis of the Warren Earp killing, as well as a study of the bruises beneath soft body armor when bullets of various calibers strike a person wearing the armor.

== Sexual abuse conviction ==
Anderson was arrested on July 30, 2004, on allegations of sexual abuse of a minor girl. He was convicted and jailed on July 19, 2006, of three counts of lewd acts upon a child under the age of 14, and one count of continuous sexual abuse. On February 2, 2007, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison and ordered to pay $68,000 in restitution, fines, and fees. Scientific colleagues regarded his sentence as a &#x27;loss to science&#x27;. The victim was the daughter of his senior lab scientist and business partner from China. The jury was played a recorded conversation between Anderson and the victim in which Anderson is heard saying a number of damaging statements, calling his own behavior “evil.” Additional evidence presented at the trial included several emails between Anderson and the victim. He was eligible for parole after serving 85 percent of his sentence. He was released from prison on May 17, 2018, and served a five-year parole.

<doc id="769602" wikidata="Q433551" url="?curid=769602" title="Lewis Moody">
<text>Lewis Walton Moody MBE (born 12 June 1978 in Ascot) is an English retired rugby union player. He played for Leicester Tigers and Bath Rugby and was part of the 2003 World Cup winning side.

Moody is known for the enthusiasm with which he played the game, his willingness to chase down opponents and his ability to compete for possession at restarts, which earned him the nickname &quot;Mad Dog&quot; from teammates and supporters.

==Background==
When Moody was five, he took up mini rugby at Bracknell, when a school friend suggested he join him. He played at Bracknell until the age of 12. He was educated at Eagle House Prep School, then Oakham School in Rutland, where he initially played rugby union at centre before moving to full back. He later studied Business Administration at De Montfort University while playing for Leicester Tigers.

==Club career==

Moody&#x27;s meeting Ed Houston signalled the beginning of his rugby career. In the Leicester Tigers youth team, he played flanker. He became the youngest Leicester Tigers&#x27; player to play a league game at 18 years and 94 days, a record now surpassed by Ben Youngs. He soon became established as Neil Back&#x27;s understudy for the openside flanker shirt. Making the Tigers starting XV was difficult however, as internationals Neil Back and Martin Corry took two of the three starting positions, with Paul Gustard and Will Johnson (younger brother of Martin) fighting for the remaining place.

Moody was an unused replacement for the 2001 Heineken Cup Final but started the victorious 2002 Heineken Cup Final, and was a member of the Tigers side in the four Premiership winning seasons in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. The arrival of New Zealand international openside Josh Kronfeld at Leicester in 2001, threatened to relegate Moody to third choice openside. However, Kronfeld failed to settle at the club and despite offers from Harlequins and Bath, Moody decided to stay. After the World Cup success in 2003, he suffered a stress fracture of his foot which took a long time to heal and kept him out of the remaining 2003–04 season. Moody made a return in October 2004, in the Heineken European Cup match against Calvisano.

Moody won his fifth Premiership medal in 2007, starting the final and scoring a try as Leicester defeated Gloucester.

He was injured for much of the 2008–2009 season, which was his Testimonial season for the club, but returned to play in the 73–3 win over Bristol, and featured in both the Heineken Cup final and the Guinness Premiership win. Moody stayed fit for the entire 2009–2010 season, and even captained the side in the home fixture against Sale. The Tigers won the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership, beating Saracens 33–27 at Twickenham.

In the 2010–2011 season, he joined Bath Rugby on a three-year deal along with Sam Vesty.

Moody picked up a knee ligament injury in Bath&#x27;s 55–16 win over Aironi in January 2011 but had been confident of making the England team for their opening Six Nations clash with Wales on 4 February.

Moody announced his retirement from rugby on 6 March 2012 with immediate effect due to injuries.

==International career==
Moody scored two tries for England Colts against Wales in April 1997, and was a member of the side that won the Madrid Sevens at the end of that season. He was later called up to the senior team for the 1998–99 &quot;tour from hell&quot; but did not make an appearance.

Moody made his England debut against Canada on 2 June 2001, when the established internationals Neil Back and Richard Hill were touring Australia with the British and Irish Lions. He won a further two caps on the North American tour and scored a try against the US Eagles in San Francisco. He was then called up to the senior squad for the match against Ireland in Dublin in October 2001 and came on to win cap number four.

Continued impressive form saw him challenge his teammate, Neil Back, for the coveted England No.7 shirt, starting in two Six Nations games the following season. Moody displaced Lawrence Dallaglio from the first choice England XV for the 2002/3 autumn internationals scoring a try in the game against New Zealand, but was injured against South Africa and Dallaglio regained his place. He returned to fitness and again featured in Clive Woodward&#x27;s plans, but a further injury in the first Six Nations match against France threatened to curtail the rest of his season.

He was not considered for the summer tour due to that injury, but recovered well enough to play in the pre-world cup friendlies against France and Wales in the summer, scoring a try in the game at the Millennium Stadium.

He played a part in all seven World Cup matches and came on as a replacement in the final to replace Hill. He won the final line-out in the phase of play which led to Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s winning drop goal. He missed the remaining 2003–4 season due to a foot injury. With the retirement of Dallaglio and Back, and Hill out injured, he started all three of England&#x27;s autumn internationals. Moody remained an England mainstay into 2005. That year he became the first English player to be sent off at Twickenham, when he was dismissed for fighting during the autumn international with Leicester teammate Alex Tuilagi.

Having missed the 2007 Six Nations Championship through injury, Moody was selected as part of the England squad for the 2007 World Cup in France. Having been named to start a warm up match against France Moody suffered a further injury and consequently was left out of the starting line up for England&#x27;s first three games of the campaign. Following a disappointing start to the tournament Moody was called into the starting line up for the final pool match against Tonga, where he was lauded for England&#x27;s much improved competition at the breakdown.

Moody kept his place in the starting line up for the quarter-final against Australia where he &#x27;outshone his illustrious opposite number&#x27; George Smith. Moody again started the semi-final against France, and lined up against South Africa in the World Cup final on 20 October, which England narrowly lost to the southern hemisphere side.

He was picked for the 2008 Six Nations Championship and started in the first game against Wales but was substituted in the first half because of an Achilles tendon injury. He returned to play against the Barbarians in June 2009, but was subsequently dropped from the squad, and appeared in the England Saxons EPS for the 2009–10 Season. Club form and injuries to other opensides such as Tom Rees saw him regain his England starting position for the Autumn Internationals against Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand. He continued this form into the 2010 Six Nations Championship.

Moody captained England in their final 2010 Six Nations Championship match against France in Paris, replacing regular captain Steve Borthwick, who had to pull out due to injury. He was also named England Captain for the 2010 summer tour to Australia.

Due to the knee injury he picked up in January 2011, Lewis missed the whole of the 2011 Six Nations tournament however Martin Johnson confirmed Lewis would be England captain for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, provided he was fit. He was selected in the 30-man squad that flew to New Zealand.

On 23 October 2011, Lewis Moody announced his retirement from international rugby.

==The Lewis Moody Foundation==
The Lewis Moody Foundation, inspired by young rugby fan Joss Rowley Stark, raises funds to promote awareness of brain tumours in children through the award-winning HeadSmart campaign, funds vital research into brain tumour diagnosis and gives families living with critical illness days out of the ordinary to lift spirits and create special memories.

==Personal life==
Moody married Annie (an interior designer) in June 2006. The couple live in Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire and have a property development company. They have two children.

He enjoys extreme sports—although he suffers from vertigo—and his current hobbies include wakeboarding, travelling and golf.

Moody is a patron and supporter of a number of charities including The Social Entrepreneurs Project, HOPEHIV, Rainbow Trust children&#x27;s charity and Our Lady&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital. In August 2012 Moody highlighted his battle with ulcerative colitis and the impact this had on his training.

In May 2014, Lewis and his wife Annie set up The Lewis Moody Foundation, inspired by Joss Rowley-Stark, to fund groundbreaking research to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours and give families a day out of the ordinary to lift spirits and create special memories.

In August 2014, Moody was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<doc id="769604" wikidata="Q807964" url="?curid=769604" title="Barco (manufacturer)">
<text>Barco NV is a Belgian technology company that specializes in digital projection and imaging technology, focusing on three core markets: entertainment, enterprise, and healthcare. It employs employees located in 90 countries. The company has 400 granted patents. Barco is headquartered in Kortrijk, Belgium, and has its own facilities for Sales &amp; Marketing, Customer Support, R&amp;D and Manufacturing in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. Shares of Barco are listed on Euronext Brussels. It has a market cap of around €900 million (December 2024). Barco sells its ClickShare products to enable wireless projection from sender devices to receiver displays.

== History ==
Barco is an acronym that originally stood for Belgian American Radio Corporation. Barco was founded in 1934 in the town of Poperinge, in the Flemish-speaking region of Belgium. Founder Lucien de Puydt&#x27;s initial business was to assemble radios from parts imported from the United States – hence the name of his company, the Belgium American Radio Corporation, or &quot;Barco&quot;.

Radio pioneer Camiel Descamps gave the company a new start in 1941 in Kortrijk after founder Lucien Depuydt died. His wife Maria-Anna Reyntjens and his brother-in-law Joseph Versavel assisted him. Later on, also Elie Timmerman joined them. Starting from their office in Kortrijk, the company started to grow and spread around 90 countries across the globe.

In 1949, Barco started developing a multi-standard television that accepted different signal standards, becoming a leader in that field. A jukebox called Barc-O-Matic was sold from 1951. In 1967, it was one of the first European companies to introduce color TV. Building on this, it then entered the professional broadcast market in the late 1960s, supplying TV monitors to broadcasters.

From the 1960s onwards, Barco branched out into numerous other activities, which included mechanical components for industrial use, and quality control monitoring for the textile and plastics industries. In 1967, Barco became the first European manufacturer to produce transistor-based portable televisions.

Barco first entered projection technology in 1979, when it pioneered the development of cathode ray tube (CRT) projection aboard airplanes. Over the following years, it gradually focused solely on professional markets.

In the mid-1980s, Barco became a main projection technology supplier for computer giants IBM, Apple and Hewlett-Packard. In the late 1980s, it entered the Brussels stock market. By 1991, Barco&#x27;s market share in the graphics projection market alone reached 75%, and the company had established offices across the world, including regional headquarters in the United States and East-Asia.

Through the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium, Barco developed and marketed new display technologies such as liquid crystal display (LCD), light-emitting diodes (LED), Texas Instruments&#x27; Digital Light Processing (DLP), and later, liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS). It now covers markets that include media and entertainment, security and monitoring, medical imaging, avionics, 3D and virtual reality, digital cinema, traffic control, broadcast and training and simulation.

In 2018, Barco entered into a joint venture with China Film Group Corporation (CFG), Appotronics and CITICPE to commercialize each company&#x27;s products and services for the global cinema market excluding mainland China: Cinionic. In Barco&#x27;s case, this involved the company&#x27;s cinema projectors.

=== Sustainability ===
Barco&#x27;s Corporate Sustainability Committee, consisting of 13 members, under the leadership of Filip Pintelon, devises an overall sustainability strategy. Under the label &quot;Barco 2020&quot;, Barco is currently developing a sustainability plan encompassing three pillars: their people, their community and the planet.

It is also among the top three Portuguese sports clubs in number of non-affiliated fans. Their home ground has been the Estádio José Alvalade, built in 2003, which replaced the previous one, built-in 1956. The club&#x27;s indoor arena is the Pavilhão João Rocha multi-sports pavilion. Its youth academy has helped produce footballers such as Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Sporting is the third most decorated Portuguese football team, with 55 major trophies. Domestically, they have won 20 League titles, 17 Taças de Portugal, a joint-record of 4 Campeonato de Portugal, 4 Taças da Liga and 9 Supertaças Cândido de Oliveira. In Europe, they won the 1963–64 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and were runners-up at the UEFA Cup in 2005 and at the Latin Cup in 1949. Sporting played in the first European Champions Cup match on 4 September 1955, by invitation, and has participated in the most editions of UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League (36), a tournament in which they have the most matches played and the second most matches won, and where they are ranked first in the all-time club ranking.

==History==

===Foundation (1902–1906)===

Sporting Clube de Portugal has its origins in June 1902, when a group of young men including Francisco da Ponte e Horta Gavazzo and his brother José Maria decided to create &quot;Sport Club de Belas&quot;. This club, the first ancestor of Sporting, played just one match and at the end of the year&#x27;s summer, disbanded. Two years later, the idea of creating a football club was revived, and this time, with the Gavazzo brothers joined by José Alvalade (José Holtreman Roquette) and José Stromp; a new club, the &quot;Campo Grande Football Club&quot;, was founded. They played their matches on the estate of the Viscount of Alvalade (Alfredo Holtreman), José Alvalade&#x27;s grandfather, with the club&#x27;s headquarters located in Francisco Gavazzo&#x27;s home. For two years, the club developed an intense activity on several sports, namely football, tennis and fencing.

The club also organized parties and picnics. Eventually, during one picnic, on 12 April 1906, discussions erupted, as some members defended that the club should only be focused on organizing picnics and social events, with another group defending that the club should be focused on the practising of sports instead. Some time later, José Gavazzo, José Alvalade and 17 other members left the club, with José Alvalade saying: &quot;I&#x27;ll go to my grandad and he&#x27;ll give me money to make another club.&quot; As such, a new club, without a name, was founded on 8 May 1906, and on 26 May, it was named &quot;Campo Grande Sporting Clube&quot;. The Viscount of Alvalade, whose money and land helped found the club, was the first president of Sporting. José Alvalade, as one of the main founders and first club member (&quot;sócio&quot;), uttered on behalf of himself and his fellow co-founders: &quot;We want this club to be a great club, as great as the greatest in Europe.&quot; Beyond José Holtreman Roquette (José Alvalade) and his grandfather Alfredo das Neves Holtreman (Viscount of Alvalade), among the founders were also the brothers António, José and Francisco Stromp, the Gavazzo brothers, José Maria do Couto Valente da Ponte and José Ferreira Roquette. Two months later, on 1 July 1906, António Félix da Costa Júnior suggested the name &quot;Sporting Clube de Portugal&quot;, and since 1920 that is the club&#x27;s foundation date.

===Early years (1907–1946)===
The year 1907 marked some &quot;firsts&quot; for the club, as Sporting played the first football match of their history on 3 February, ending in a 5–1 defeat against third division club &quot;Cruz Negra;&quot; inaugurated their first ground, known as &quot;Sítio das Mouras&quot; (the most advanced in Portugal at the time, equipped with showers, two tennis courts, an athletics track and a football field) on 4 July; and played the first derby of all time against local rivals S.L. Benfica (then known as &quot;Grupo Sport Lisboa&quot;) on 1 December. As early as 1909, the following sports were practised at the sports club: football, running and jumping (athletics), physical exercise (gymnastics), rope-wrestling, tennis, cricket and field hockey.

The club also released their first report card on 31 March 1922, titled &quot;Boletim do Sporting&quot; (Sporting&#x27;s Report), lending the foundation for the later called &quot;Jornal do Sporting&quot;, the official newspaper of the club, that still exists today.

Sporting played their first Primeira Liga game (the 1st Division of Portuguese football) ever on 20 January 1935, winning 0–6 against Académica de Coimbra. A year later, in 1936, the club had their heaviest ever defeat against Porto, losing 10–1. Sporting, however, got their revenge a year later, when they humbled the same team with a 9–1 result. In 1941, under the guidance of Hungarian manager József Szabó, the club celebrated the first league title of their history.

===Golden years and fading (1946–1982)===
The football team had their height during the 1940s and 1950s. It was spearheaded by Fernando Peyroteo, José Travassos, Albano Pereira, Jesus Correia and Manuel Vasques, in a quintet nicknamed &quot;The Five Violins&quot;. With the violins&#x27; help, Sporting won seven league titles in eight seasons between 1947 and 1954, including a then unprecedented four in a row from 1950 to 1951 onwards. Fernando Peyroteo, the most known of &quot;the violins&quot;, is considered one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time.

Sporting and the Yugoslavian team Partizan both made history on 4 September 1955, as they played the first-ever UEFA Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup match. Sporting player João Martins scored the first-ever goal of the competition, on the 14th minute. The match ended in a 3–3 draw. Sporting also inaugurated their new venue, &quot;José Alvalade Stadium&quot;, on 10 June 1956, which would be their home ground until 2003.

In the 1960s, Sporting achieved continental success, winning the 1963–64 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, defeating MTK Budapest of Hungary in the final. It was the only time a Portuguese team side won a UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup title. The team entered the competition defeating Atalanta in the qualifying round, then past Cypriot club APOEL in what was the biggest win in a single UEFA competitions game to date: 16–1, a record that still stands today. On the next round, they lost 4–1 to Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first hand, but made a remarkable comeback at home, winning 5–0. In the semi-finals, Sporting eliminated Lyon, and in the end MTK Budapest, in a two-round final to win their first European title. The winning goal was scored by João Morais from a direct corner kick.

Under the leadership of president João Rocha, the first project of club-company in Portugal was approved by Sporting CP&#x27;s affiliated partners (&quot;sócios&quot;) in November 1973, and denominated &quot;Society of Constructions and Planning&quot; (&quot;SCP, Sociedade de Construções e Planeamento&quot;). The Portuguese government authorised the establishment of the company and the issue of 2.5 million shares, with a nominal value of 100 escudos each. The club-company project with issuance of stock was hampered shortly after due to the events of the Carnation Revolution of 1974 and the subsequent Processo Revolucionário em Curso of 1975 (the creation of &quot;Sociedades Anónimas Desportivas&quot; (&quot;Public limited sports companies&quot;) would be later available in Portugal through a new legal status only introduced in the 1990s).

The club reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1974, but lost to eventual winners 1. FC Magdeburg of East Germany.

===First league title drought (1982–2000)===

English manager Malcolm Allison arrived at Sporting in 1981, and under his guidance the club won the domestic double (league title and Portuguese cup), in 1982. In the years between 1982 and 2000, Sporting suffered from a drought of titles. Despite defeating rivals Benfica 4–0 on aggregate to win the Portuguese Super Cup in 1987, Sporting fans had to wait until 1995 to see their team win some silverware after beating Marítimo 2–0 in the final of the 1995 Portuguese Cup. That victory granted Sporting a place in the following season&#x27;s Portuguese Super Cup. After drawing 0–0 at the José Alvalade Stadium and securing a 2–2 draw at the Estádio das Antas, a replay match was held on 30 April 1996 at the Parc de Princes in Paris. Sporting won 3–0 with Sá Pinto scoring twice and Carlos Xavier scoring a stoppage time penalty. In the same 1995–96 season, Sporting also reached the Portuguese Cup Final but lost 3–1 to Benfica.

Highlights of this period of time also include a 7–1 victory over arch-rivals Benfica at the old José Alvalade Stadium on 14 December 1986. Sporting also reached the UEFA Cup semi-final in 1991, losing against Internazionale. Also, Barcelona and Real Madrid were both tied and defeated in Lisbon when playing against Sporting in the old UEFA Cup, in the 1986–87 and 1994–95 seasons, respectively.

In 1998, Sporting had created the Sporting Clube de Portugal – Futebol, SAD, a public limited sports company for its football department, which went public on the Lisbon Stock Exchange in that year at a price of 1,000 escudos (the equivalent of about five euros at the time) per share.

===The turn of the millennium (2000–2002)===

In 2000, Sporting, led by manager Augusto Inácio (a former Sporting player, who replaced Giuseppe Materazzi at the beginning of the season), won the league title on the last match day, with a 4–0 victory over Salgueiros, ending an 18-year drought. In the following season, Sporting conquered the 2000 Super Cup but came third in the league. In the 2001–02 season, led by coach László Bölöni, Sporting conquered their 18th league title, the Portuguese Cup and the 2002 Portuguese Super Cup. On 21 June 2002, the club had opened its training facility, located in Alcochete, 30 km east of Lisbon.

On 14 August 2002, Cristiano Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a Sporting CP&#x27;s senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at home against Inter Milan. On 1 September 2002, in the Azores, Cristiano Ronaldo debuted as a senior player in official domestic competitions playing for Sporting CP B in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia and on 29 September he made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP&#x27;s main team in a way match against SC Braga.

===Second league title drought (2002–2021)===

====2002–2009====

Sporting have failed to win Primeira Liga again since 2002. On 6 August 2003, the new Sporting CP&#x27;s stadium, the Estádio José Alvalade, was inaugurated. In the 2004–05 season, José Peseiro-led Sporting was leading the Primeira Liga and was trailing a remarkable journey in UEFA Cup. However, at the end of the season, the team eventually lost all the chances of winning any trophy that season: the first set-back had already happened on 26 January 2005 when Sporting was eliminated from Taça de Portugal after losing 7–6 on penalties against Benfica. Nevertheless, Sporting was able to reach the leadership of Primeira Liga, and on 5 May the team booked their second European final, after defeating Dutch team AZ in UEFA Cup. While awaiting the Final, on 14 May, Sporting lost its penultimate match in Primeira Liga against Benfica and dropped to third place. By the end of the season, the team eventually finished 2004–05 Primeira Liga in that place. Lastly, playing the 2005 UEFA Cup Final at their home ground, on 18 May, Sporting lost 1–3 against Russian side CSKA Moscow, after being 1–0 up at halftime.

Domestically, Sporting had back-to-back wins in the Portuguese Cup in 2007 and 2008 (led by coach Paulo Bento). Sporting also reached, for the first time, the knockout phase of UEFA Champions League, in the 2008–09 season, but were roundly defeated by Bayern Munich, with an aggregate loss of 12–1. This is widely regarded as one of the lowest points in the history of the club. The club almost reached another European final in 2012, but were dropped out of the competition by Athletic Bilbao, in the semi-finals of the 2011–12 Europa League.

==== Financial mismanagement and 2013 election ====
After years of financial mismanagement, Sporting had amassed debts exceeding €276 million by 2011. The results on the pitch were also negative, with Sporting finishing seventh in the 2012–13 Primeira Liga, their lowest ever finish. Managerial changes occurred within months or weeks apart: from November 2009 to May 2013, nine managers were contracted, with none of them lasting an entire season. In 2013, after pressure from club members, president Godinho Lopes resigned, and shortly afterwards, Bruno de Carvalho was elected president in a snap election. Carvalho intended to return success to the football team, while threatening to take Godinho Lopes to court, as well as to renegotiate the club&#x27;s debt payment schedule with the banks involved, which eventually renegotiated the debt in very favourable conditions for Sporting CP in the following years as part of the club&#x27;s financial restructuring started by Carvalho and finalized by Frederico Varandas ten years later. This allowed Sporting CP to get a multimillion-euro debt relief – in contrast to their rivals. Carvalho&#x27;s election brought Angolan investors to the club, most notably Álvaro Sobrinho, through Holdimo, which ultimately took possession of 20 million shares of Sporting&#x27;s SAD through conversion of convertible debt.

On 5 June 2015, it was released an audit that analyzed the management of Sporting in the past 20 years: it concluded that in 1994 the club had €55 million worth of real estate assets and an almost nonexistent debt; by 2013, real estate assets were almost nonexistent, and the club had amassed a €331 million debt. Their new stadium (completed in 2003) cost 74% more than what was expected when its construction started (€184 million against the planned €106 million), while their training facility cost 24% more, and the costs of &quot;Alvalade XXI&quot; neighbourhood, a real estate complex located around the stadium, overshot its estimate by 60%; such complex was almost entirely sold in the following years, many estates of which were sold below market prices.

From 1995 to 2013, the club invested €261 million in the football team, however, with few sports and financial results. The audit criticized many football transfers in the 2000s, in which the club paid commissions well above market prices to player agents, and discovered that Sporting even had paid commissions without evidence of written contracts. The audit also concluded that the administrations from 1995 to 2013 intended to convert Sporting, a multi-sports club, exclusively into a football club – although they did not openly admitted so – which was being done gradually through the closure of other sport modalities. Moreover, the audit also pointed out evidence of mismanagement and conflicts of interest by several administrators. Considering the audit&#x27;s results, club members approved the expulsion of Godinho Lopes as an associate of the club in June 2015.

====2013–2020====
Led by coach Leonardo Jardim in the 2013–14 season, Sporting finished second in the league, thus gaining direct access to the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, their first Champions League presence in five years.

In the 2014–15 season, Sporting won their 16th Portuguese Cup in dramatic fashion. The Lisbon side, led by Marco Silva, played the final against Braga, and after a disastrous start, found themselves losing 0–2 at half-time and playing with ten men after the sending-off of Cédric Soares. With the final seemingly lost, Islam Slimani gave some hope to the fans as he scored the 1–2 on the 83-minute. In stoppage time, Fredy Montero managed to equalize, forcing extra-time. Sporting ultimately won the match 3–1 on penalties. Celebrations ended in a pacific pitch invasion of Estádio José Alvalade by the fans, as the club touched silverware for the first time in seven years.

In June 2015, Jorge Jesus joined Sporting after Benfica opted not to renew his contract as coach of the club, signing a three-year contract. Presented as the new manager of the club on 1 July, the managerial change took the rivalry of both Lisbon clubs to new heights. Under Jesus&#x27; tenure, Sporting won the Portuguese Super Cup for the eighth time, against back-to-back champions Benfica. Despite a positive start, Sporting did not win any other trophy, finishing second in the Primeira Liga with 86 points, two points behind Benfica, despite breaking their own points record in the league.

Following a trophyless season, Sporting won their first Taça da Liga on a penalty shoot-out against Vitória de Setúbal. However, on 15 May 2018, days after finishing third in the league, several players and coaches were attacked by around 50 ultra supporters of Sporting at the club&#x27;s training ground (9 of them would be sentenced to at least a specified term of actual imprisonment after trial). Five days later, Sporting lost the Portuguese Cup final to Aves. About a month later, Bruno de Carvalho was dismissed by club members after a general assembly on 23 June. This followed the rescissions of nine players: Bruno Fernandes, Daniel Podence, Rui Patricio, Rodrigo Battaglia, Rafael Leão, Rúben Ribeiro, Bas Dost, Gelson Martins and William Carvalho. Sporting would be later eligible for court-awarded compensation when the rescissions were declared illegal for those players who did not return to the club or were not sold by Sporting.

In the period before scheduled elections, a management committee, headed by former President Sousa Cintra as acting president of the sports club, succeeded in returning some of the players who had left the club following the incident, namely Bruno Fernandes, Bas Dost and Rodrigo Battaglia. Frederico Varandas was elected president on 8 September 2018. Having replaced Jorge Jesus at the beginning of the 2018–19 season, José Peseiro was sacked after a poor performance on the Primeira Liga.

In March 2019, Sporting CP announced a loan negotiated with Apollo Global Management, based on the securitization of NOS&#x27; television rights revenues.

In March 2020, Ruben Amorim was appointed manager of Sporting CP for a managerial transfer worth €10 million (£8.65 million), becoming the third-most expensive manager ever.

=== 2020–present ===
In the 2020–21 season, with no spectators allowed in Portugal due to COVID-19 restrictions, and after being eliminated from European competition by LASK Linz, Sporting won their third league cup and ended their 19-year period without winning the Portuguese league, with only one loss (against Benfica in the penultimate round and already as champions), securing their 19th Primeira Liga title after a 1–0 home win against Boavista.
At the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League group stage, Sporting made a comeback by finishing second on Group C after a 5–1 home loss to Ajax and 1–0 away loss to Borussia Dortmund, thereby reaching the knockout phase for only the second time since the 2008–09 season. Domestically, both the 2021 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and the 2021–22 Taça da Liga were won by the Lions, securing the trophies against Braga and Benfica, respectively. In the 2021–22 Primeira Liga, Sporting finished second with the same 85 points as in the previous league campaign. In the 2023-24 league season, Sporting record signing Viktor Gyökeres helped propel the club to their 20th Primeira liga title, won on the fifth of May after Benfica&#x27;s 2–0 loss to Famalicão.

For the 2022–2026 quadrennium, Frederico Varandas&#x27; administration started works of building renovation and modernization of the club&#x27;s facilities. In December 2023, Sporting and its SAD had gone ahead with a financial restructuring started in 2019 on the grounds of earlier agreements with creditors jump-started by Bruno de Carvalho which included the renegotiation of bank debt, &quot;extinguishing the debt originally belonging to Novo Banco, S.A. (with outstanding capital of 35,403,508.62 euros), with the exception of finance leases&quot;, the company announced in a statement sent to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM). A debt belonging to Millennium BCP was also settled. In addition, Sporting announced it would own 88 per cent of Sporting SAD from 15 February 2024 onwards, instead of the 83.90% it owned at the time. With the completion of the restructuring, the club said it intended to start a new strategic financial planning and secure the entry of a minority investor in its Futebol, SAD.

==Motto, crests, kits, mascot and names==

===Motto===
Since its formation, Sporting CP&#x27;s motto is: &quot;Effort, Dedication, Devotion and Glory&quot; (&quot;Esforço, Dedicação, Devoção e Glória&quot;).

===Crests===
The stylized rampant lion of the crest was taken by the Viscount of Alvalade from the heraldry of Dom Fernando de Castello-Branco, Mayor of Cascais and the main promoter of football at Sporting Club de Cascais (widely known at the time as Sporting Club da Parada). However, Castello-Branco demanded that the color used by the new sports club should not be blue, since that was already a color adopted by Sporting Club da Parada. To keep up with times, the club&#x27;s emblem has been modernized throughout history and this led to the development of various crests consistent with the history of the club: in all of them, the rampant lion and the color green have always been present in prominence. Since its founding on the 1st July 1906, Sporting has already had five emblems, in addition to two commemorating crests for the fiftieth (1956) and the one hundredth years of existence (2006) of the club.

Sporting CP radically changed its emblem in 2001 to convey a message of modernity, more geared towards the new technologies at the time. The current emblem presents an image with simplified framing while maintaining the green color in the shield and adding three horizontal white stripes that symbolize the club&#x27;s shirt. Complemented with the words &#x27;Sporting&#x27; and &#x27;Portugal&#x27;, now written in full, they emphasize the national dimension of the club and clarify its name internationally. A stylized rampant lion appears in golden color and the acronym &quot;SCP&quot;, which stands for the club&#x27;s name (Sporting Clube de Portugal), is shown like a crown on top of the shield.

=== Kits ===
When the club was founded in 1906, its players wore white jerseys. On 25 October 1908, Sporting presented the first ten football shirts that would come to be known as the Stromp kit. The initiative came from founder Eduardo Quintela de Mendonça. The Stromp kit is split at the top, with the right half white and the left half painted green. It was named in honour of one of the club&#x27;s main founders, Francisco Stromp, and it had white shorts, with the shorts changing to black in 1915. It stopped being used as the main jersey in 1928. On 6 November 1927, the horizontally striped green and white jerseys that Salazar Carreira, sportsman and sports manager linked to the club since 1912, had chosen for the club&#x27;s rugby team in 1926 were worn by the football team for the first time in a friendly match against Casa Pia, but after that the Stromp kit continued to be used. When Sporting&#x27;s football team travelled to Brazil in July 1928, and after considering the weather conditions in that country, it was decided to wear the horizontally striped jerseys because they were lighter and tighter to the body. On their return, the Sporting&#x27;s football team once again wore the traditional split jerseys known as the Stromp kit. However, on 5 October 1928, in a match against Benfica, whether it was because of the heavy rain that made them too heavy, or for some other reason, at half-time the players swapped their usual jerseys for the striped ones, thus establishing what is still the club&#x27;s main kit today: green and white horizontally striped jersey with black shorts.

=== Mascot ===
The club&#x27;s mascot is called Jubas, plural of the Portuguese word for mane, and is an anthropomorphic version of a lion wearing customized standard equipment and attire worn by the players of Sporting CP&#x27;s main team. It also wears official Loja Verde (Sporting CP&#x27;s official store) garment in both charity and promotional marketing initiatives.

===Names===
Founded on 1 July 1906, after two months during which the newly created sports club project was temporarily called Campo Grande Sporting Club (after Campo Grande), instead of its final official name, Sporting Clube de Portugal, which could be literally translated as “Sporting Club of Portugal”, the club is officially referred to by UEFA and FIFA as written in its official full name or as &quot;Sporting CP&quot;, a shortened form of the name. The designation &quot;Sporting Lisbon&quot;, a common way some foreign media and non-Portuguese speaking people use to refer to Sporting CP outside Portugal, has been a source of contention and controversy for some &quot;sportinguistas&quot; because it does not conform with the official name of the sports club and its brand value. Regarding this issue, club supporters and officials have promoted awareness campaigns to raise people&#x27;s awareness nationwide and internationally, and the club changed its official crest in 2001 with a focus on the name of the club and its words &quot;Sporting&quot; and &quot;Portugal&quot; in mind.

== Support ==

Sporting CP&#x27;s supporters or fans are called &quot;sportinguistas&quot;. The club has about 150,000 affiliated members (called &quot;sócios&quot;) and research studies have suggested it has a number of fans ranging from 1,100,000 to 2,700,000 in Portugal alone – which makes it the second or third most supported sports club in Portugal, depending on the study. Like the other two Portuguese Big Three sports clubs, Sporting CP has also a sizable number of foreign fans in other Portuguese-speaking countries beyond Portugal itself and supporters among the Portuguese expatriate community.

The club&#x27;s anthem is the &quot;Sporting&#x27;s March&quot; (original official name: &quot;&quot;A Marcha do Sporting&quot;). It was written in 1955 by songwriters Eduardo Damas and Manuel Paião and originally sung by Portuguese singer Maria José Valério. Sporting CP created and uses its own &#x27;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&#x27;-style song, through a Portuguese version of the classic song popularised by Frank Sinatra &#x27;My Way&#x27; called &quot;O Mundo Sabe Que&quot; that is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on match day. Other popular songs include &quot;Só Eu Sei&quot; and &quot;Curva Belíssima&quot; popularized by organized Sporting CP&#x27;s supporter&#x27;s group Juventude Leonina, as well as &quot;Dia de Jogo&quot;, &quot;Força Brutal&quot; and &quot;Voto Solene&quot;&quot; sung by Sporting CP&#x27;s-themed rock band Supporting&quot;.&quot;

Throughout its history the club and its supporters established centres, branches and delegations (&quot;núcleos, filiais e delegações&quot;) of Sporting CP across Portugal and abroad. Among them, branches such as Sporting Clube de Tomar (branch number 1), Farense (branch number 2), Olhanense (branch number 4), Covilhã (branch number 8) and Campomaiorense (branch number 27), as well as delegations such as Lusitânia (delegation number 14), became noted autonomous sports clubs that reached the top level of Portuguese league systems in sports like football, rink hockey or basketball. Founded in 1920, Sporting Clube de Lourenço Marques (branch number 6 until 1975 and later renamed as CD Maxaquene) was also a branch of Sporting CP in Mozambique, East Africa, and under this original name, Portuguese footballer Eusébio graduated as a footballer and played for the Mozambican club at both youth level and the main squad between the ages of 15 and 18. The centres were created and institutionalised in Sporting&#x27;s 10th Club Statutes of 1984 and are characterised as being a group of &quot;sportinguistas&quot; who get together and organise themselves to promote, support, celebrate and publicise Sporting CP. Many of them are also involved in important recreational, social and sporting activities. The branches, more than 100 were founded around the world, are sports clubs that have associated themselves with Sporting CP&#x27;s core values, are managed as autonomous sports clubs and contribute to the expansion of Sporting CP. The delegations are sporting, recreational and cultural institutions that represent the interests of Sporting CP in the places where they are based and mobilise the ideals of the club in those same regions.

==Rivalries==
===Lisbon derby===

Sporting&#x27;s main rivals are Benfica, with both teams contesting the Lisbon derby, also known as &quot;the eternal derby&quot;, among other names. The local rivalry started in 1907 when eight Benfica players left for Sporting looking for better training conditions. The first derby was contested that year and ended with a 2–1 win for Sporting. One of Sporting&#x27;s biggest defeats to Benfica, 7–2, happened at the original Estádio da Luz on 28 April 1948, as well as three 5–0 losses, in 1939, 1978 and 1986. The biggest Sporting win over Benfica, 7–1, occurred at the original Estádio José Alvalade on 14 December 1986. Manuel Fernandes was particularly inspired and scored four goals; Mário Jorge two and Ralph Meade one; Wando scored for Benfica.

Before the start of the 1993–94 season, Sousa Cintra, then president of Sporting, took advantage of Benfica&#x27;s financial crisis by signing Paulo Sousa and Pacheco, who had terminated their contracts with the latter club. This event became known as &quot;Verão Quente&quot; (Hot Summer). Later, on 14 May 1994, a memorable derby was played at the old José Alvalade Stadium, crowded to the top, as winning the derby could be a decisive step for Sporting in trying to regain the title, which by that time they had not won for 12 years. Sporting were considered the favourites, with a squad composed by Luís Figo, Paulo Sousa, Krasimir Balakov, Ivaylo Yordanov, Emílio Peixe, Stan Valckx and others; therefore, Benfica were seen as the underdogs. However, Benfica defied the odds and won the match 6–3 and went on securing the league title weeks later, leaving Sporting empty-handed in one of the most dramatic seasons in their history. Two years later, the rivalry continued intense with a dramatic incident in the 1996 Portuguese Cup final, which Benfica won 3–1. After the latter scored the first goal, a supporter of the club lit a flare which eventually struck a Sporting fan in the chest, killing him instantly.

Eight years later, on 3 May 2004, Geovanni&#x27;s winning goal for Benfica in the 87th minute at Alvalade caused a pitch invasion by Sporting fans. In November 2011, after a 1–0 loss to Benfica at the Estádio da Luz, Sporting supporters set fire to one of the stands of the stadium. Four years later, on 7 February 2015, during a futsal derby, members of No Name Boys, one of Benfica&#x27;s unofficial supporters&#x27; groups, showed a banner saying &quot;Very Light 96&quot;, in reference to the 1996 incident. The next day, during a football derby at Estádio José Alvalade, an official supporters&#x27; group of Sporting, Juve Leo, showed a banner with the inscription &quot;Sigam o King&quot; (&quot;Follow the King&quot;), in reference to Eusébio&#x27;s death a month before.

===Sporting vs Porto===
Sporting has also a rivalry with Porto. Outside of the sports environment itself, the confrontation between Lions and Dragons represents a form of expression in sport, and in football in particular, of the political and regional differentiation between Lisbon and the North of Portugal. The confrontation captured the national imagination, having been remembered in the film &quot;O Leão da Estrela&quot; (1947) starring António Silva and Artur Agostinho, a classic of the Portuguese cinema, and in its remake of 2015 starring Miguel Guilherme.

Sporting and Porto have decided a competition 13 times. The first final won by Sporting took place only in 1978, at the Estádio Nacional, for the Taça de Portugal. The dispute was decided in two matches, a 1–1 draw and a 2–1 victory in the tie-breaker. There would be three more finals in the same location. In 1994, Porto also won the tiebreaker 2–1. In 2000, Porto won the tiebreaker again 2–0. And, in the 2007–08 Taça de Portugal Sporting won in extra time 2–0. In the 2019, after eleven years, Sporting won once again, with a 2–2 draw after extra time, with Sporting winning the penalty shootout 4–3.

Another four decisions between Porto and Sporting were for the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. In 1996, in a tie-breaker valid for the 1994–95 edition; in 2001, valid for the 1999–2000 edition; and in 2007 and 2008. In the first two finals, the matches were held over two legs in the fields of rivals, with tiebreakers in Paris (1996) and Coimbra (2001). In 2007 and 2008, under the format in force since 2001, the decisions took place in a single match held in Leiria and in the Algarve.

Another decision between the two clubs took place in 2019, counting for the 2018–19 Taça da Liga. The match took place in Braga, ending with a 3–1 victory on penalties, after a 1–1 draw in regular time.

Despite the rivalry, both clubs formed an alliance against Benfica in 2017, when Bruno de Carvalho was the president of Sporting.

==Facilities==

===Stadium===
Throughout its history, Sporting has had several grounds. The first one was inaugurated on 4 July 1907, and was called &quot;Sítio das Mouras&quot;. It was a state-of-the-art facility at the time and included changing rooms with individual lockers and changing rooms with showers and baths. It included a grass playing field for football and two tennis courts. It was considered luxurious and had also an athletics track. This was followed by the Estádio do Campo Grande (1917–1937) and the Estádio do Lumiar (1937–1956). In 1956, the first Estádio José Alvalade was inaugurated. Sporting played their matches there until 2003, when the stadium was demolished.

A new stadium, Estádio José Alvalade, was built for the UEFA Euro 2004, hosted by Portugal. Designed by Tomás Taveira, it was inaugurated on 6 August 2003 and the wider complex called Alvalade XXI included a shopping mall, cinemas, health center, office space, residential areas, club&#x27;s museum, official club store and other infrastructure. The opening match was a 3–1 victory over Manchester United in a friendly game that marked the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting CP. The stadium was awarded a &#x27;five-star&#x27; certificate at 2005 UEFA Cup Final by then UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The stadium has a capacity of 50,095 spectators. The Multidesportivo Sporting, is a multi-sports arena located in a five-floor semi-detached building next to the stadium proper.

The stadium hosted quarter-finals and semi-finals matches during the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League.

=== Academia Cristiano Ronaldo and youth academy ===
The Cristiano Ronaldo Academy is the center of all Sporting CP&#x27;s football activity. It is the place where the Sporting CP professional football team has all its daily preparation and also serves as a hub for carrying out internships. It is at the Sporting Professional Academy of Football that Sporting hosts its support staff, which includes the directive, clinical and administrative components. On the other hand, the academy is also Sporting CP&#x27;s Sports Training School.

Sporting&#x27;s youth academy system helped develop Ballon d&#x27;Or recipients Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo.

In the victorious campaign of Portuguese National Team in the Euro 2016 10 out of the 14 players who played the final against France were players &quot;made in Sporting&quot;. Moreover, at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Sporting CP had 14 players that came through their youth system, making it the most represented youth academy system in the tournament, followed by Barcelona with eleven.

===Pavilhão João Rocha===
With a total capacity of 3,000 seats, spread over 4 stands and a corporate area, Sporting CP&#x27;s indoor arena named after former Sporting CP&#x27;s president João Rocha is the largest one in Portugal belonging to a sports club. Its dimensions meet the requirements for all indoor team sports, with an automatic table system for roller hockey, and an advanced video and multimedia system. In the roundabout between the pavilion and the stadium, a monument was also inaugurated to evoke the club. Those who follow the path that surrounds the pavilion will find the &quot;Passeio da Fama&quot; (Walk of Fame) of Sporting CP&#x27;s former and current athletic glories where the names of famous Sporting CP&#x27;s players, athletes, coaching staff and executives such as António Livramento, Carlos Lopes, Dionísio Castro, Domingos Castro, Fernando Mamede, Fernando Peyroteo, Francis Obikwelu, Joaquim Agostinho, José Travassos, Manuel Fernandes, Mário Moniz Pereira, Miguel Maia, Naide Gomes, Patrícia Mamona and Teresa Machado, among many others, can be found. Next to the pavilion there is the Sporting CP&#x27;s youth academy school &quot;Escola Academia Aurélio Pereira&quot; (named after the club&#x27;s historical youth development principal Aurélio Pereira) with three 5-a-side football fields, with the aim of complementing the Pólo EUL (Sporting CP&#x27;s facilities for U13 development footballers at the EUL – Estádio Universitário de Lisboa). One of the entrances to the pavilion gives access to a Loja Verde (the club&#x27;s official store) and to a branch of the Sporting Museum, with a design more focused on virtual realities and the concept of a museum in real time. There is also an auditorium prepared to host conferences, training courses and special events. The Pavilion and all the surrounding space is prepared to host concerts and cultural events.

==Media==
===Newspaper===
&quot;Jornal Sporting&quot; is a weekly newspaper published by Sporting. Beginning its activity as &quot;Sporting Club of Portugal Bulletin&quot; on 31 March 1922, it was initially an eight-page calendar, with the optional payment of $2 a semester. Under the direction of Artur da Cunha Rosa, the bulletin became known as a newspaper in June 1952.

===Sporting TV===
Sporting TV is the television channel of Sporting Clube de Portugal. An open channel available on satellite and cable television as well as online, it is offered by telecommunications companies MEO, NOS, Vodafone and Nowo in Portugal, and also in other countries like Angola and Mozambique, where it is broadcast by operator ZAP. The channel broadcasts content linked to Sporting CP&#x27;s universe ranging from documentaries, interviews, talk shows, news and post-match analysis and commentary programs, to live and recorded Sporting CP&#x27;s ball sport matches and coverage of all the other competitions and sporting events involving the multi-sports club.

== Museum ==
Inaugurated on 31 August 2004 in Lisbon, the Sporting Museum (&quot;Museu Sporting&quot;) is divided into several thematic areas that express the wealth of the club&#x27;s heritage and its sporting achievements over more than a century of existence in thirty-two different modalities. About two thousand trophies are on display, and there are many others in store.

The history of the museum dates back to the trophy room of the old headquarters on Rua do Passadiço, where in 1956, 1850 trophies were already stored. In 1994, President Sousa Cintra inaugurated a new trophy room, where less than half of the club&#x27;s collections were exhibited. The following year the remodeling and organization of the museum is promoted, and a conservative viewpoint is incorporated. During the construction of the new Estádio José Alvalade a new museum is inaugurated, culminating in four years of investigation. Throughout the years, through donations with several origins, in addition to the trophies the patrimony of the club never stopped growing. In July 2016, there was a new inauguration after a total renovation.

Outside of Lisbon, there is also an official Sporting Museum in the city of Leiria, in the Central Region of Portugal.

== Foundation ==
Sporting CP had already developed social solidarity initiatives throughout its history, but in 2006 it created a section called Sporting Solidário, which until the creation of the Sporting Foundation developed a series of social solidarity actions. Established in 2012, the Fundação Sporting (Sporting Foundation), is a humanitarian charity foundation devoted to helping people in need, including children at risk, the homeless and war victims. In-kind donations are collected by the Sporting Foundation on match days and the proceeds from the sale of tickets of some selected matches at Estádio José Alvalade go to the Sporting Foundation to finance the foundation&#x27;s charity work.

<text>George Whelan Anderson Jr. (December 15, 1906 – March 20, 1992) was an admiral in the United States Navy and a diplomat. Serving as the Chief of Naval Operations between 1961 and 1963, he was in charge of the US blockade of Cuba during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Early life and career==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 15, 1906, Anderson attended Brooklyn Preparatory School, entered the United States Naval Academy in 1923 and graduated with the class of 1927. Then, he became a naval aviator and served on cruisers and aircraft carriers, including the .

In World War II, Anderson served as the navigator on the fourth . After the war, he served as the commanding officer of the escort carrier and of the . He also served tours as an assistant to General Dwight Eisenhower at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W. Radford, and as chief of staff to the Commander in Chief Pacific.

==Flag assignments==
As a flag officer, Anderson commanded Task Force 77 between Taiwan and Mainland China, Carrier Division 6, in the Mediterranean during the 1958 Lebanon landing and, as a vice admiral, commanded the United States Sixth Fleet.

As Chief of Naval Operations in charge of the US quarantine of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Anderson distinguished himself in the Navy&#x27;s conduct of those operations. &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured him on the cover and called him &quot;an aggressive blue-water sailor of unfaltering competence and uncommon flair.&quot; He had, however, a contentious relationship with Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. At one point during the crisis, Anderson ordered McNamara out of the Pentagon&#x27;s Flag Plot when the Secretary inquired as to the Navy&#x27;s intended procedures for stopping Soviet submarines; McNamara viewed those actions as mutinous and forced Anderson to retire in 1963. Decades later, the role of Vasily Arkhipov became widely known, as the last person standing in the way of Admiral Anderson&#x27;s procedures unintentionally triggering nuclear war.

==Later career==
Anderson took early retirement, largely because of the ongoing conflict with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

John F. Kennedy subsequently appointed Anderson Ambassador to Portugal, where he served for three years and encouraged plans for the peaceful transition of Portugal&#x27;s African colonies to independence. He later returned to government service from 1973 to 1977 as member and later chairman of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

After his retirement from the navy, Anderson was chairman of Lamar Advertising Company, an outdoor advertising company, and he was a director on the boards of Value Line, National Airlines and Crown Seal and Cork.

==Family and death==
Anderson&#x27;s first wife was Muriel Buttling (1911–1947). They had two sons and a daughter.

Anderson died on March 20, 1992, of congestive heart failure, at the age of 85, in McLean, Virginia. He was survived by his second wife of 44 years, the former Mary Lee Sample (née Anderson), the widow of William Sample; a daughter; a stepdaughter; twelve grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. He was buried on March 23, 1992, in Section 1 of Arlington National Cemetery.

==Cultural depictions==
Anderson was portrayed by Kenneth Tobey in The Missiles of October and Madison Mason in Thirteen Days (film).

<text>Joseph Inslee Anderson (November 5, 1757 – April 17, 1837) was an American soldier, judge, and politician, who served as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1797 to 1815, and later as the First Comptroller of the United States Treasury. He also served as one of three judges of the Southwest Territory in the 1790s, and was a delegate to the Tennessee state constitutional convention in 1796.

From January to December 1805, Anderson served as President pro tempore of the United States.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Anderson was born at White Marsh, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of William Anderson and Elizabeth Inslee. He acquired a good education and studied law. In 1776, following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he enlisted in the 3rd New Jersey Regiment of the Continental Army, and rose to the rank of captain and paymaster in less than two years. Anderson fought at the Battle of Monmouth, and was with the army during its difficult 1777 wintering at Valley Forge. In 1781, he transferred to the 1st New Jersey Regiment, and fought with this unit at the Battle of Yorktown.

At the end of the war, Anderson was discharged with the rank of major. Having studied law before the war, he was admitted to the Delaware bar, and practiced law in Delaware from 1784 to 1791. He owned slaves.

Anderson was a Freemason. He was a member of Military Lodge No. 19 of Pennsylvania and became a member of Lodge No. 36 while in the New Jersey Brigade. After the war, he was the first Senior Warden of Princeton Lodge No. 38 in Princeton, New Jersey.
===Early Tennessee politics===

In 1791, President George Washington appointed Anderson United States judge of the newly formed Southwest Territory. He served alongside David Campbell and John McNairy. No records of any of the trials presided over by Anderson survive, with the exception of a 1794 murder trial. This trial, conducted at the Tellico Blockhouse, concerned an Indian charged with killing settler Joseph Ish.

In 1792, Anderson married Only Patience Outlaw, the daughter of Tennessee pioneer Alexander Outlaw. His wife&#x27;s dowry included land along the Nolichucky River in what is now Hamblen County (but was then a part of Jefferson), where the Andersons built their home, Soldier&#x27;s Rest.

In 1796, Anderson and his father-in-law represented Jefferson County at Tennessee&#x27;s constitutional convention in Knoxville. Resolutions introduced by Anderson and Outlaw included a motion to sever ties with the United States if Tennessee&#x27;s petition for statehood was rejected, a motion to implement &quot;viva voce&quot; voting instead of balloting, and a motion to establish a unicameral legislature, all of which were rejected. Anderson swore in the new state&#x27;s first legislature later that year.

===United States Senate===

In 1797, Anderson was elected by the Tennessee General Assembly to fill the vacancy in the Senate created by that body&#x27;s expulsion of the seat&#x27;s original occupant, William Blount. That term was scheduled to expire on March 3, 1799; however, on December 12, 1798, the Tennessee General Assembly elected Anderson to the state&#x27;s other (Class 1) Senate seat, which had been vacated by Andrew Jackson, and was temporarily held by Daniel Smith. Anderson was re-elected to this seat in 1803, and again in 1809. In the latter election, he defeated retiring governor John Sevier by a vote of 23 to 16.

Anderson voted against a Senate proposal to have Blount arrested in 1797. He opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts, federal intervention into the issue of slavery, the rechartering of the national bank, and the usage of military force in the Quasi-War. He voted in favor of the War of 1812. In the Eighth Congress (1803–1804), he served as the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore.

===Later life===

After retiring from the Senate, Anderson was appointed Comptroller of the U.S. Treasury, the first to hold that office, by President James Madison, and served in that office from 1815 until 1836. He died in Washington on April 17, 1837, and was interred in the Congressional Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Anderson&#x27;s son, Alexander Outlaw Anderson, served as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee from 1840 to 1841, and helped organize the government of the State of California in the early 1850s. Another son, William, served in the state legislature, and a nephew, James W. Deaderick, served as a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Anderson County, Tennessee, is named for Joseph Anderson, as well as Andersonville.

<text>Personal defense weapons (PDWs) are a class of compact, magazine-fed automatic firearms that are typically submachine guns designed to fire rifle-like cartridges. Most PDWs fire a small-caliber (generally less than in bullet diameter), high-velocity centerfire bottleneck cartridge resembling a scaled-down intermediate cartridge, essentially making them an &quot;in-between&quot; hybrid between a submachine gun and a conventional carbine.

The use of these rifle-like cartridges gives the PDWs much better ballistic performance (effective range, external ballistics and armor-penetrating capability) than conventional submachine guns, which fire larger-caliber but slower and less aerodynamic handgun cartridges. The low recoil of these &quot;sub-intermediate&quot; cartridges also makes muzzle jumps on PDWs (which typically have short barrels) much easier to handle than short-barreled rifles, especially when shooting in automatic fire or burst fire.

The name describes the weapon&#x27;s original conceptual role: as a compact but powerful small arm that can be conveniently carried for personal defense, usually by support personnel behind the front line such as military engineers, logistic drivers, medical specialists, artillery crews, or signallers. These &quot;second-line&quot; personnel are not strictly combat troops expected to directly engage the enemy, but may still be at risk of encountering decently equipped (and often well-armored) hostile skirmishers and infiltrators, therefore having to defend themselves in close quarters. Such encounters will warrant an effective weapon that is easy to use while having sufficient firepower to suppress enemy charges and hold them beyond a safe perimeter to prevent the defenders from being overrun, but the risk of hostility is rare enough that a standard service rifle would be an unnecessary burden during their normal duties.

Because of their light weight, controllability, ease of operation and close-range effectiveness (can penetrate a NATO CRISAT vest or an NIJ IIIA soft Kevlar armor at up to ), PDWs have also been used by special forces, paramilitaries, heavily armed tactical police, and bodyguards.

==History==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, shortened versions of the infantry rifle were issued as &quot;carbines&quot; for cavalry troops and gun crews. This designation was dropped as infantry rifle designs became shortened overall, such as in the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield rifle. Thereafter, handguns were typically issued as self-defense weapons. However, they were not effective in most close combat situations. As a result, during the First World War, the Mauser C96 and artillery versions of the Luger pistol were issued with attachable shoulder stock holsters, which allowed for greater control and accuracy.
During World War I, the United States secretly developed the Pedersen device attachment for the M1903 Springfield rifle that allowed it to fire the .30-18 Auto (7.65×20mm Longue) pistol cartridge in semi-automatic mode. This attachment was developed to allow an infantryman to convert &quot;his rifle to a form of submachine gun or automatic rifle&quot; in approximately 15 seconds.

Production of the device and modified M1903 rifles started in 1918. However, the war ended before they were sent to Europe. The contract was cancelled on March 1, 1919, after production of 65,000 devices, 1.6 million magazines, 65 million cartridges and 101,775 modified Springfield rifles. The Pedersen device was declared surplus in 1931. To prevent them from falling into the hands of the lawless, nearly all of the stored devices were destroyed by the Army except for a few examples kept by Ordnance Department.

In 1918, Ribeyrolles, Sutter and Chauchat designed the Chauchat-Ribeyrolles 1918 submachine gun. This weapon was meant to be used for close-range protection for the French tank crews. The weapon is based on the RSC Mle. 1917 semi-automatic rifle mechanism. The first trials used a Mannlicher–Berthier clip holding eight cartridges. The trials continued until 1919 with a weapon using the same magazine as the Chauchat. The results were satisfactory but the weapon was too powerful for the intended self-protection use. A mix of standard and tracer bullets was planned to be used to assist in aiming.

In 1938, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department received a request for a light rifle to be issued to mortarmen, radiomen, drivers, clerks, cooks, and similar grades. During field exercises, these troops found that the M1 Garand rifle was too heavy and too cumbersome for general issue. And, while handguns are undeniably convenient, they had limited range, accuracy and power. This request was refused by authorities.

In 1940, after Germany&#x27;s use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to infiltrate and attack strategic points behind the front lines, the request for a light rifle was resubmitted and subsequently approved. U.S. Army Ordnance issued a requirement for a &quot;light rifle&quot; with greater range, firepower, and accuracy than the M1911 pistol while weighing half as much as the M1 Garand. As a result, the U.S. developed the semi-automatic M1 Carbine and shortly thereafter the select-fire M2 Carbine. Widely employed until the end of the Vietnam War, these carbines are generally considered the forerunners of modern personal defense weapons.

In 1969, AO-46 was an unsolicited design by Peter Andreevich Tkachev working at TsNIITochMash. Although not accepted for service, this design, in combination with report of the US use of the XM-177 in Vietnam led the GRAU to start the competition known as Project Modern, which led to the adoption of AKS-74U for service.

In 1979, Rock Island Arsenal designed a version of the M16 assault rifle adapted for shooting from firing ports on the M2 Bradley, named the M231 Firing Port Weapon. In 1980, the weapon was adopted as the M231. Although most of the Bradley AFV&#x27;s ports have since been removed, these weapons are maintained, and are used by crews for self-defense, close-quarters situations, and for firing from the rear door firing ports as intended.
Developed during the 1980s, the &quot;Personal Defense Weapon&quot; (PDW) concept was created in response to a NATO request as a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum submachine guns. The PDW is a compact automatic weapon that can defeat enemy body armor and which can be used conveniently by non-combatant and support troops, as well as a close quarters battle weapon for special forces and counter-terrorist groups.

Introduced in 1991, the FN P90 features a bullpup design with a futuristic appearance. It has a 50-round magazine housed horizontally above the barrel, an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls. A simple blow-back automatic weapon, it was designed to fire the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge which can penetrate soft body armor. The P90 was designed to have a length no greater than a man&#x27;s shoulder width, to allow it to be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle.

Introduced in 2001, the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 is a direct rival to the FN P90. Featuring a more conventional-looking design, the MP7 uses a short-stroke piston gas system as used on H&amp;K&#x27;s G36 and HK416 assault rifles, in place of a blowback system traditionally seen on submachine guns. The MP7 is able to use 20-, 30- and 40-round magazines and fires 4.6×30mm ammunition which can penetrate soft body armor. Due to the heavy use of polymers in its construction, the MP7 is much lighter than older SMG designs, weighing only with an empty 20-round magazine.

Russia uses 7N21 and 7N31 cartridges which are hotter loaded 9x19mm Parabellum cartridges with special armor piercing bullets. The armor piercing bullets consist of a hardened steel core inside a lighter sleeve which damages soft targets but strips off if it hits an armored target and lets the core pierce it. The RG054 variant of the 9×21mm cartridge follows the same pattern. The space between the core and the bimetallic jacket is filled with polyethyelene which results in 7N21 being lighter than regular 9×19mm, 7N31 is even lighter than 7N21. Using a different variant of the same cartridge bears the advantage that regular ammunition can still be used. The PP-19-01 Vityaz, PP-2000 and GSh-18 can use regular 9×19mm Parabellum as well as the 7N21 and 7N31 ammunition. The Russian Aerospace Forces added the PPK-20 variant of the PP-19-01 Vityaz into the ejection survival kits of the MiG-29, Mig-35, Su-24, Su-27, Su-30SM, Su-34, Su-35 and Su-57.

==Applications==
The PDW concept has not been widely successful, partly because existing PDWs are not significantly cheaper to manufacture than carbines or full-size military rifles. Most PDWs also use a proprietary cartridge, such as the 5.7×28mm cartridge for the FN P90 or the 4.6×30mm for the H&amp;K MP7, neither of which were originally compatible with any existing pistols or rifles/carbines. Although both manufacturers planned handguns that used the same proprietary rounds, only FN went forward with production of the Five-SeveN pistol, which was the only handgun option available for the 5.7×28mm cartridge for over two decades until the introduction of Ruger-57 in 2019. In turn, this made the PDW cartridges expensive to consumers due to the lack of mass production.

Though personal defense weapons have not been very popular for their intended application, they have been acquired by various military special forces units and law enforcement groups, as an upgrade for their older submachine guns. The FN P90 and Five-seven pistol are used by military and police forces in over 40 countries, including Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, India, Peru, Poland, Spain, and the United States. The Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 is also used in a number of countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.

<text>Birley Spa is a grade-II listed community bath hall and a Victorian bathhouse in the Hackenthorpe district of the City of Sheffield, England. 

==History==
The bath house was built for Charles Herbert Pierrepont, 2nd Earl Manvers and the Lord of the Manor of Beighton in 1842, and initially was a hotel with spa baths beneath. Subsequently, it was used for many years as private dwellings. In the 1973 it was given Grade II listed building status. 

During the mid 1800s a committee was created consisting of Thomas Staniforth from the Thomas Staniforth &amp; Co Sickle works, Edward Hobson, George Cox of Beighton and John Tillotson, schoolmaster of Beighton. A man named George Eadon was selected from eleven applicants who applied for the post of manager of the &#x27;Bath Hotel&#x27;, and was paid a salary of twenty pounds and was provided free rent and coal. 

By 1895 the baths were failing to make a profit and only a single plunge bath remained in use, it appears the hotel itself was closed around 1878 and it is believed that the Earl Manvers removed the marble from the building himself for personal use.

Around 1895 John Platts was the proprietor of the property, he was a well known gardener and a farmer.

By the time of the 1920s and 30s, the grounds of the bath house were transformed into a Pleasure Ground for children. Mr Moulson and William Smith were the proprietors at this time. The grounds featured a wishing well, a sand pit, swing boats, a paddling pool and the large lake behind the house was used for boating and fishing. There was also a &#x27;wonder tree&#x27; in the wooded area beside the house, which was a large oak tree said to be over 1,000 years old. When the Second World War began in 1939, the grounds were closed.

The grounds was transferred to Sheffield Corporation in the 1950s, and in the early 2000s it became part of the Shire Brook Valley Local Nature Reserve.

The building was restored in 2000/2002 and for a time was open for tours by the public, but this has recently ceased.

In June 2018 renewed interest was brought to Birley Spa due to its neglect, and a Friends of Birley Spa group was formed.

The Friends Group was formed in response to the Councils intention to sell the building. The sale was withdrawn and the Bath House has been made an Asset of Community Value. Talks are ongoing with the Council to secure a sustainable future for the Spa. The building requires extensive repairs, due to lack of maintenance and neglect. Plans are underway for fundraising events, and applications to funding bodies will be submitted. Work has started with volunteers, supported by Park Rangers, to restore the grounds.

<text>The ICC Men&#x27;s Champions Trophy, formerly called the Knockout Trophy, is a quadrennial cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council played in ODI format. The 2025 edition is underway. 

Inaugurated in 1998, The ICC conceived the idea of the Champions Trophy – a short cricket tournament to raise funds for the development of the game in non-test playing countries. It can be compared to FIFA Confederations Cup in football. It remains as one of the ICC events that has the same format as that of another big cricketing event, in this case One Day International like the Cricket World Cup.

The first Champions Trophy was organised in Bangladesh in June 1998, with the Cricket World Cup having had existed for 23 years with six completed editions. The first two Champions Trophies were held in ICC Associate member nations – Bangladesh and Kenya, to increase the popularity of the sport in those countries and then use the funds collected for the development of their cricket. From the 2002 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with six ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.

The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place in the preceding edition of the Cricket World Cup, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. The top eight ranked teams in the World Cup (including the hosts of the Champions Trophy) secure a berth for the tournament. A total of thirteen teams have competed in the 8 editions of the tournament, with eight teams competing in the 2017 tournament. Australia and India are the two most successful teams winning the tournament twice, while South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Pakistan have won it once each. Seven national teams have played in every edition of the tournament yet.

== History ==

===ICC KnockOut Trophy (1998–2000)===
The first Cricket World Cup was held in 1975 and then every four years since. The tournament was usually played by full ICC member nations. The ICC conceived the idea of the Champions Trophy – a short cricket tournament to raise funds for the development of the game in non-test playing countries, with the first two tournaments being held in Bangladesh and Kenya.

It was inaugurated as the ICC KnockOut Trophy in 1998. Its name was changed to the Champions Trophy before the 2002 edition.

===ICC Champions Trophy (2002–2017)===
Since 2002, the tournament has been held in full ICC member nations with the number of teams reduced to eight. The tournament, later dubbed the &quot;Mini World Cup&quot; as it involved all of the full members of the ICC, was planned as a knock-out tournament so that it was short and did not reduce the value and importance of the World Cup. However, from 2002, the tournament has had a round-robin format, followed by a few knockout games, but the tournament still takes places over a short period of time – about two weeks.

The number of teams competing has varied over the years; originally all the ICC&#x27;s full members took part, and from 2000 to 2004 associate members were also involved. Since 2009, the tournament has only involved the eight highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Rankings as of six months prior to the beginning of the tournament. The tournament has been held in 7 countries since its inception, with England hosting it thrice.

Up to 2006 the Champions Trophy was held every two years. The tournament had been scheduled to be held in Pakistan in 2008 but was moved to South Africa in 2009 due to security reasons. From then on it has been held every four years like the World Cup.

There were calls to scrap the tournament after 2013 and 2017, with no tournament hosted in 2021. However, it was reinstated in 2025.
=== Revival and rebranding (2025 onwards) ===
On 13 November 2024, the ICC launched a refreshed visual identity with an unconventional typographic logo for the Champions Trophy with the release of a brand launch video. The new elements are accompanied by the distinctive white jackets which nod to the history of the Champions Trophy.

Pakistan was announced as the host of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, however, due to India&#x27;s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the tournament citing security concerns, an agreement was made between the BCCI and the PCB for games to be played across Pakistan and a neutral venue, later announced as the UAE.

== Format ==

===Qualification===
In the first eight editions, the top teams in the ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings qualified in the tournament.
In the first 2 editions, a few pairs of teams played in the Pre-Quarter-finals to determine who would move on to the Quarter-finals. The number of teams was 9 in 1998, which was increased to 11 in 2000 and to 12 in 2002. In 2006, it was reduced to 10, with four teams playing in a qualifying round-robin from which 2 progressed to the main tournament. From the 2009 tournament onwards, the number further reduced to 8.

From the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy onwards, the top eight teams of the ICC Men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup will qualify for the event.

=== Tournament ===
The Champions Trophy differs from the World Cup in a number of ways. The matches in the Champions Trophy are held over a period of around two and a half weeks, while the World Cup can last for over a month. The number of teams in the Champions Trophy are fewer than the World Cup, with the latest edition of the World Cup having 10 teams whereas the latest edition of the Champions Trophy having 8.

For 2002 and 2004, twelve teams played a round-robin tournament in four pools of three, with the top team in each pool moving forward to the semi-final. A team would play only four games (two in the pool, semi-final and final) to win the tournament. The format used in the Knock Out tournaments differed from the formats used in the Champions Trophy. The competition was a straight knock out, with no pools and the loser in each game being eliminated. Only eight games were played in 1998, and 10 games in 2000.

Since 2009, eight teams have played in two pools of four in a round-robin format, with the top two teams in each pool playing in the semi-finals. Losing a single match potentially means elimination from the tournament. A total of 15 matches are played in the present format of the tournament, with the tournament lasting about two and a half weeks.

== Hosts ==
England has hosted the tournament for the most times – 3 (2004, 2013, 2017) followed by Wales (2013 and 2017). Bangladesh, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India and South Africa have all hosted the tournament once each.

Sri Lanka were the first (and currently the only) host team to win the tournament (alongside joint winners India), while also being the first home team to reach the final of the tournament. England reached the final two times, both on home soil, only to lose to winners West Indies (2004) and India (2013) respectively.

In 2021, the ICC announced the Future Tours Programme for the 2024–2031 cycle, announcing Pakistan as the host for the 2025 edition and India for the 2029 edition of the tournament.

== Results == 
==Tournament summary==
Thirteen nations have qualified for the Champions Trophy at least once. Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament. Seven different nations have won the title. South Africa won the inaugural tournament, India and Australia have each won twice, while New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Pakistan have each won once. Australia (2006, 2009) is the only nation to have won consecutive titles. Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, England and Ireland are the only full icc member nations (test-playing nations) not to win the Champions Trophy. England has reached the final twice, but lost both times (2004, 2013), Bangladesh reached the semi-finals in 2017, while Zimbabwe has never got past the first round. The highest rank secured by an associate member nation (non test-playing nations) is the 9th rank in first stage achieved by Kenya in 2000.

Sri Lanka was the first and only host to win the tournament, in 2002, but they were declared co-champions with India as the final was twice washed out. England is the only other host to have made the final. It has achieved this twice – in 2004 and 2013. Bangladesh is the only host who did not take part in the tournament while hosting it, in 1998. Kenya in 2000, India in 2006, and South Africa in 2009 have been the only host teams that were eliminated in the first round.

=== 1998 ICC Knock Out Trophy ===

All of the matches in the 1998 tournament were played in Bangladesh at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka. The tournament was won by South Africa who beat West Indies in the final. Philo Wallace of West Indies was the leading run scorer in the tournament of scoring 221 runs.

=== 2000 ICC Knock Out Trophy ===
All of the matches in the 2000 tournament were played at Gymkhana Club Ground in Nairobi, Kenya. All the test playing nations participated in the tournament along with the finals, involving Kenya, India, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh and England. The tournament was won by New Zealand who beat India in the final. Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly (348) was the leading run scorer in this tournament. Venkatesh Prasad (8) was the leading wicket taker. This was the first ICC event won by New Zealand. It was also their only ICC trophy till 2021, and their only limited overs tournament till date.

=== 2002 ICC Champions Trophy ===

The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy was held in Sri Lanka, and included the 10 ICC Test playing nations including the newly appointed full member Bangladesh, Kenya (ODI status) and the 2001 ICC Trophy winners Netherlands. The final between India and Sri Lanka was washed out due to rain twice to leave no result. First, Sri Lanka played 50 overs and then India played two overs before the rain caused interruption. The next day, Sri Lanka again played 50 overs and India played eight overs. In the end India and Sri Lanka were declared joint winners. The teams played 110 overs, but there was no result. Virender Sehwag (271) had the highest number of runs in the tournament and Muralitharan (10) had the highest number of wickets.

=== 2004 ICC Champions Trophy ===
The 2004 ICC Champions Trophy was held in England and the nations competing included the ten ICC Test nations, Kenya (ODI status), and – making their One Day International debut – the United States who qualified by winning the recent 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge. The competition was more like a knockout series where teams losing even one game at the group stage were out of the tournament. The 12 teams were divided into 4 groups and the table topper from each group played semi finals. ENG defeated AUS in the 1st semi-final to make their 4th appearance in final of an ICC event. PAK lost to WI in the second semi final, which was a low scoring game. In the final game the WI team under Lara&#x27;s leadership won a tense match with the help of wicket keeper C Browne and tailender Ian Bradshaw.

=== 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ===

The 2006 ICC Champions Trophy was held in India with the final on 5 November 2006. A new format was used. Eight teams were competing in the group phase: the top six teams in the ICC ODI Championship on 1 April 2006, plus two teams chosen from the other four Test-playing teams Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, chosen from a pre-tournament round robin qualifying round. West Indies and Sri Lanka qualified ahead of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

The eight teams were then split into two groups of four in a round robin competition. While Australia and West Indies qualified from Group A, South Africa and New Zealand qualified from Group B for the semifinals. Australia and West Indies reached the final defeating New Zealand and South Africa, respectively. In the final, Australia beat West Indies by 8 wickets to win the trophy for the first time. The venues for the tournament were Mohali, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Mumbai.

=== 2009 ICC Champions Trophy ===

In 2006, the ICC selected Pakistan to host the 2008 ICC Champions Trophy. On 24 August 2008 it was announced that the 2008 ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan has been postponed to October 2009 as several countries were reluctant to visit Pakistan for security reasons. However, due to the crowded international schedule around that date, and concerns about whether the security situation would have changed by that time, there was widespread scepticism whether it would actually take place in 2009.

On 16 March 2009, an announcement was made that the ICC has recommended that the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy be moved from Pakistan to South Africa.

On 2 April 2009, Cricket South Africa confirmed that it would host the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy from 24 September to 5 October. The Board accepted recommendations from the ICC that Liberty Life Wanderers (Johannesburg) and Supersport Park (Centurion) be the host venues. The details of SA&#x27;s hosting of the Champions Trophy were ironed out at a meeting between CSA&#x27;s CEO Gerald Majola and ICC general manager – Commercial, Campbell Jamieson. Majola confirmed that the six warm-up games will be played at Benoni&#x27;s Willowmoore Park, and Senwes Park in Potchefstroom.

Australia beat England by 9 wickets in the 1st semi-final, and New Zealand beat Pakistan by 5 wickets in the 2nd semi-final, to set up a final that saw Australia beat New Zealand by 6 wickets, in 45.2 overs.

=== 2013 ICC Champions Trophy ===
England and Wales hosted the 2013 Champions Trophy. England became the only country to host the Champions Trophy twice. Australia failed to win a single game in their group, and were knocked out along with New Zealand in Group A. Pakistan lost all three games in Group B and were knocked out along with West Indies. England and Sri Lanka from Group A, and India and South Africa from Group B, made it to the semi-finals.

India and England won their respective games against Sri Lanka and South Africa comprehensively and the final between the two took place on 23 June 2013. India beat England by 5 runs at Edgbaston, winning their second title, although their first title, in 2002, was shared with Sri Lanka due to the final being washed out. Ravindra Jadeja was adjudged man of the match and he also received the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; for taking the most wickets in the tournament. Shikhar Dhawan received the &quot;Golden Bat&quot; for scoring the most runs in the series and was also adjudged the Man of the Series for his consistent outstanding performances. MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies – World Cup in 2011, World T20 in 2007 and this edition of the Champions Trophy.

=== 2017 ICC Champions Trophy ===
In the lead-up to the 2013 tournament, the ICC announced that the 2013 Champions Trophy was to be the last, with its place in the cricketing calendar to be taken by a new ICC World Test Championship. However, in January 2014, that decision was reversed, due to the massive success of the 2013 edition, with the ICC confirming that the 2017 Champions Trophy tournament would take place and the proposed Test Championship was cancelled. England and Wales hosted the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. England became the only country to host the Champions Trophy thrice, and England and Wales became the only countries to host the ICC Champions Trophy consecutively, also hosting the 2013 edition. Bangladesh replaced the West Indies, who finished outside the top eight in ninth position, in the ICC ODI Team Rankings on the cut-off date. Bangladesh returned to the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since 2006, and, for the first time, the West Indies failed to qualify, having won the tournament in 2004.

Arch-rivals Pakistan and defending champions India took each other on in the final of a tournament for the first time since 2007, with the final taking place at The Oval in London. It was India&#x27;s fourth appearance and Pakistan&#x27;s maiden appearance in a Champions Trophy final. Pakistan beat India comfortably by 180 runs, outclassing them across all three departments-batting, bowling and fielding, unlike in the match between the two teams in the group stages, where India had beaten Pakistan by a huge margin. Pakistan, the lowest-ranked team in the competition, won their first Champions Trophy title and became the seventh nation to win it.

Fakhar Zaman of Pakistan received the Man of the Match award for scoring 114. Shikhar Dhawan of India received the &quot;Golden Bat&quot; award for scoring 338 runs, and became the first and only batter to not only win 2 Golden Bats in the ICC Champions Trophy but also 2 consecutive Golden Bats (he also won it in 2013). Hasan Ali of Pakistan received the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; award for taking 13 wickets; he was also adjudged the Man of the Series for his outstanding contribution towards Pakistan&#x27;s first ICC title since the 2009 T20 World Cup.

=== 2025 ICC Champions Trophy ===

In November 2021, it was announced that the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy was to be held in Pakistan. Due to political tensions, India refused to play matches in Pakistan and it was decided that tournament would take place using a hybrid model] with India&#x27;s group matches and potential semi-final scheduled to be played in Dubai, with the final also to be moved to Dubai if India qualifies.

=== 2029 ICC Champions Trophy ===

In November 2021, it was announced that the 2029 ICC Champions Trophy would be held in India. It is expected to be played in October and November 2029.

<text>The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. that was established in 1876. It represents medical schools, teaching hospitals, and academic and scientific societies, while providing services to its member institutions that include data from medical, education, and health studies, as well as consulting. The AAMC administers the Medical College Admission Test and operates the American Medical College Application Service and the Electronic Residency Application Service. Along with the American Medical Association (AMA), the AAMC co-sponsors the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the accrediting body for all U.S. MD-granting medical education programs.

== History ==
The AAMC was founded in 1876 at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia to establish standards for member medical schools. The first meeting was held on June 2, 1876, and included members from 22 medical colleges. Jefferson Medical College&#x27;s Dean, John B. Biddle, was the first president of the Association. The first set of standards established in 1876 included “a curriculum of two terms not occurring in the same year.” 

By 1905, the Association expanded its standards to require member schools to offer a four-year medical curriculum of no less than 4,000 hours.

In 1942, the AAMC partnered with the American Medical Association&#x27;s (AMA) Council on Medical Education and Hospitals to form the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The LCME is an accrediting agency for educational programs at medical schools in the United States and Canada.

In 2006, Darrell G. Kirch became president and CEO of AAMC, he served until 2019. On July 15, 2019, David J. Skorton replaced Kirch as president and CEO.

In 2015, the AAMC announced MCAT examinees with documented disabilities would no longer be required to inform schools if they received accommodations during their exam. Prior to this, if someone received accommodations due to a documented disability, an asterisk was affixed to the score report to inform all schools the individual applied to. The schools were not informed of the specific disability or nature of the accommodations. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the AAMC created a database of treatment and management guidance for clinicians. The resources are divided into various topics, including infection control, emergency department, inpatient, ambulatory, serious illness communication, mental health, and special populations. The AAMC also recommended that medical schools temporarily suspend medical students’ direct patient contact due to safety concerns.

Throughout 2020, the AAMC was criticized for continuing to hold the MCAT exam in person during the COVID pandemic. In October 2020, the Association responded to lawmaker&#x27;s concerns over in-person testing by saying it had resumed only when safety protocols had been developed and implemented. 

In 2020, the AAMC removed Abraham Flexner&#x27;s name from their annual award, claiming his 1910 report contained &quot;racist and sexist&quot; statements. This claim, however, has been challenged.

== Structure ==
The Association is a nonprofit organization that represents medical schools, teaching hospitals, and academic and scientific societies. All accredited MD-granting medical schools in the United States and Canada are members of the AAMC. Membership also includes teaching hospitals or health systems, including 51 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, and academic societies are also members.

The AAMC provides services including data from medical, education, and health studies, as well as consulting. The organization hosts events each year that offer continuing medical education and professional development to the health workforce.

The Association is governed by a 17-member board of directors. Ten of the board members are the chairs of the Association&#x27;s three member councils: the Council of Deans, the Council of Teaching Hospitals and Health Systems, and the Council of Faculty and Academic Societies. The remaining 7 include a medical student, a resident physician, and a member of the public not affiliated with the AAMC, a medical school, or a teaching hospital.

The Council of Faculty and Academic Societies has 94 member professional organizations. Members consist of faculty from U.S. medical schools and teaching hospitals.

The Council of Teaching Hospitals and Health Systems is composed of around 400 teaching hospitals, including Veteran Affairs medical centers.

The Council of Deans is composed of deans from all accredited medical schools in the U.S. and 17 Canadian schools.

In January 2022, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of Academic Health Centers (AAHC) approved a merger agreement. Under the agreement, the AAHC joined the AAMC on April 1, 2022, according to a Jan. 20 joint news release. The AAHC was founded in 1969 and lists over 120 U.S. and international member organizations on its website. The latter are part of the Association of Academic Health Centers International (AAHCI), a subsidiary of the U.S. organization founded in 2008.

== Programs ==
The AAMC administers the Medical College Admission Test and operates the American Medical College Application Service and the Electronic Residency Application Service which facilitate students applying to medical schools and residency programs.

=== Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) ===
The MCAT was formed in 1928 and was known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test for Medical Students”. In 1948, it was renamed the “Medical College Admission Test”. In 2015, after a review process, a new version of the test was introduced by the AAMC. The new exam added a Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section.

The review for the new exam was led by a 21-member committee composed by the Association and called the MR5 Committee. The MR5 Committee consisted of medical school deans; admissions, educational affairs, student affairs, and diversity officers; basic science and clinical faculty; pre-health advisors and undergraduate faculty; and a medical student and a physician resident. The MR5 Committee also reached out to subcommittees of experts in fields such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology.

The Association maintains a “What’s on the MCAT Exam?” webpage that includes a comprehensive list of all tested topics. They also offer a Fee Assistance Program for test takers who require financial aid in order to take the MCAT.

=== American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) ===
Led by the AAMC, the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) administers and processes medical school applications. Most U.S. medical schools participate in the AMCAS.

AMCAS was first used by applicants to medical schools in 1969.

=== Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) ===
The AAMC developed the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) to allow final-year medical school students and graduates to apply electronically for residency positions. The service was established in 1996.

== Resources and data ==
The Association conducts studies, research, and publications on medical education, health care, and biomedical research and provides publications and forums to support medical education and educational health programs. The Association is also responsible for a number of publications, including:
* The State Physician Workforce Data Report: published annually. The report looks at physician supply, medical students, and graduate medical education residents in each state. It also provides data on the breakdown of physicians by specialty and training location.
* The Medical School Admissions Requirements (MSAR): this publication includes a description of each medical school, and the median overall and science GPAs and MCATs of the first year class. The AAMC has received criticism due to charging for the MSAR. Because the MSAR contains data crucial to all those applying to medical school, critics say this practice contradicts AAMC&#x27;s official mission of making medical education available to all regardless of income. 
* The Medical School Enrollment Survey: published annually
* The Report on Medical School Faculty Salaries: provides summary tables with average compensation and percentile statistics by rank and department for basic and clinical science faculty. Additional tables summarize the data by type of school and region.
* The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: projections from 2017 to 2032

The AAMC published a three-part report on conflicts of interest in research and medical education settings. The final report was titled “In the Interest of Patients: Recommendations for Physician Financial Relationships and Clinical Decision Making,” and was released in 2010.

The AAMC publishes the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Academic Medicine&quot;. Past papers of the association are held at the National Library of Medicine.

<text>The Mexican peso crisis was a currency crisis sparked by the Mexican government&#x27;s sudden devaluation of the peso against the U.S. dollar in December 1994, which became one of the first international financial crises ignited by capital flight.

During the 1994 presidential election, the incumbent administration embarked on an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The Mexican treasury began issuing short-term debt instruments denominated in domestic currency with a guaranteed repayment in U.S. dollars, attracting foreign investors. Mexico enjoyed investor confidence and new access to international capital following its signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). However, a violent uprising in the state of Chiapas, as well as the assassination of the presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, resulted in political instability, causing investors to place an increased risk premium on Mexican assets.

In response, the Mexican central bank intervened in the foreign exchange markets to maintain the Mexican peso&#x27;s peg to the U.S. dollar by issuing dollar-denominated public debt to buy pesos. The peso&#x27;s strength caused demand for imports to increase in Mexico, resulting in a trade deficit. Speculators recognized an overvalued peso and capital began flowing out of Mexico to the United States, increasing downward market pressure on the peso. Under election pressures, Mexico purchased its own treasury securities to maintain its money supply and avert rising interest rates, drawing down the bank&#x27;s dollar reserves. Supporting the money supply by buying more dollar-denominated debt while simultaneously honoring such debt depleted the bank&#x27;s reserves by the end of 1994.

The central bank devalued the peso on December 20, 1994, and foreign investors&#x27; fear led to an even higher risk premium. To discourage the resulting capital flight, the bank raised interest rates, but higher costs of borrowing merely hurt economic growth. Unable to sell new issues of public debt or efficiently purchase dollars with devalued pesos, Mexico faced a default. Two days later, the bank allowed the peso to float freely, after which it continued to depreciate. The Mexican economy experienced inflation of around 52% and mutual funds began liquidating Mexican assets as well as emerging market assets in general. The effects spread to economies in Asia and the rest of Latin America. The United States organized a $50 billion bailout for Mexico in January 1995, administered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with the support of the G7 and Bank for International Settlements. In the aftermath of the crisis, several of Mexico&#x27;s banks collapsed amidst widespread mortgage defaults. The Mexican economy experienced a severe recession and poverty and unemployment increased.

==Precursors==
With 1994 being the final year of his administration&#x27;s sexenio (the country&#x27;s six-year executive term limit), then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari endorsed Luis Donaldo Colosio as the Institutional Revolutionary Party&#x27;s (PRI) presidential candidate for Mexico&#x27;s 1994 general election. In accordance with party tradition during election years, Salinas de Gortari began an unrecorded spending spree. Mexico&#x27;s current account deficit grew to roughly 7% of GDP that same year, and Salinas de Gortari allowed the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, Mexico&#x27;s treasury, to issue short-term peso-denominated treasury bills with a guaranteed repayment denominated in U.S. dollars, called &quot;&quot;tesobonos&quot;. These bills offered a lower yield than Mexico&#x27;s traditional peso-denominated treasury bills, called &quot;cetes&quot;&quot;, but their dollar-denominated returns were more attractive to foreign investors.
Investor confidence rose after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed. Upon NAFTA&#x27;s entry into force on January 1, 1994, Mexican businesses as well as the Mexican government enjoyed access to new foreign capital thanks to foreign investors eager to lend more money. That year Chase Manhattan Bank alone held an estimated $1.5 billion in Mexican securities. International perceptions of the country&#x27;s political risk began to shift, however, when the Zapatista Army of National Liberation declared war on the Mexican government and began a violent insurrection in Chiapas. Investors further questioned Mexico&#x27;s political uncertainties and stability when PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated while campaigning in Tijuana in March 1994, and began setting higher risk premiums on Mexican financial assets. Higher premiums initially had no effect on the peso&#x27;s value because Mexico had a fixed exchange rate.

Banco de México, the central bank, maintained the peso&#x27;s value through an exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar, allowing the peso to appreciate or depreciate against the dollar within a narrow band. To accomplish this, the central bank would frequently intervene in the open markets and buy or sell pesos to maintain the peg. The central bank&#x27;s intervention strategy partly involved issuing new short-term public debt instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. They then used the borrowed dollar capital to purchase pesos in the foreign exchange market, which, in turn, caused the peso to appreciate. The bank&#x27;s purpose in mitigating the peso&#x27;s depreciation was to protect against inflationary risks of having a markedly weaker domestic currency, but with the peso stronger than it ought to have been, domestic businesses and consumers began purchasing increasingly more imports, and Mexico began running a large trade deficit. Speculators began recognizing that the peso was artificially overvalued and led to speculative capital flight that further reinforced downward market pressure on the peso.

Mexico&#x27;s central bank deviated from standard central banking policy when it fixed the peso to the dollar in 1988. Instead of allowing its monetary base to contract and its interest rates to rise, the central bank purchased treasury bills to prop up its monetary base and prevent rising interest rates—especially given that 1994 was an election year. Additionally, servicing the tesobonos with U.S. dollar repayments further drew down the central bank&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves. Consistent with the macroeconomic trilemma in which a country with a fixed exchange rate and free flow of financial capital sacrifices monetary policy autonomy, the central bank&#x27;s interventions to revalue the peso caused Mexico&#x27;s money supply to contract (without an exchange rate peg, the currency would have been allowed to depreciate). The central bank&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves began to dwindle and it completely ran out of U.S. dollars in December 1994.

==Crisis==

On December 20, 1994, newly inaugurated President Ernesto Zedillo announced the Mexican central bank&#x27;s devaluation of the peso between 13% and 15%. Devaluing the peso after previous promises not to do so led investors to be skeptical of policymakers and fearful of additional devaluations. Investors flocked to foreign investments and placed even higher risk premia on domestic assets. This increase in risk premia placed additional upward market pressure on Mexican interest rates as well as downward market pressure on the Mexican peso. Foreign investors anticipating further currency devaluations began rapidly withdrawing capital from Mexican investments and selling off shares of stock as the Mexican Stock Exchange plummeted. To discourage such capital flight, particularly from debt instruments, the Mexican central bank raised interest rates, but higher borrowing costs ultimately hindered economic growth prospects.

When the time came for Mexico to roll over its maturing debt obligations, few investors were interested in purchasing new debt. To repay tesobonos, the central bank had little choice but to purchase dollars with its severely weakened pesos, which proved extremely expensive. The Mexican government faced an imminent sovereign default.

On December 22, the Mexican government allowed the peso to float, after which the peso depreciated another 15%. The value of the Mexican peso depreciated roughly 50% from 3.4 MXN/USD to 7.2, recovering only to 5.8 MXN/USD four months later. Prices in Mexico rose by 24% over the same four months, and total inflation in 1995 was 52%. Mutual funds, which had invested in over $45 billion worth of Mexican assets in the several years leading up to the crisis, began liquidating their positions in Mexico and other developing countries. Foreign investors not only fled Mexico but emerging markets in general, and the crisis led to financial contagion throughout other financial markets in Asia and the Americas. US investors in Mexican securities risked losses of $8 to 10 billion. The impact of Mexico&#x27;s crisis in Chile and Brazil became known as the &quot;Tequila effect&quot; ().

==Bailout==
In January 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton held a meeting with newly confirmed U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and then-Under Secretary for the Treasury Larry Summers to discuss an American response. According to Summers&#x27; recollection of the meeting:

 Secretary Rubin set the stage for it briefly. Then, as was his way, he turned to someone else, namely me, to explain the situation in more detail and our proposal. And I said that I felt that was required, and one of the President’s political advisers said, “Larry, you mean .” And I said, “No, I mean .” ... There was a certain pall over the room, and one of his [Clinton&#x27;s] other political advisers said, “Mr. President, if you send that money to Mexico and it doesn’t come back before 1996, you won’t be coming back after 1996.”

Clinton decided nevertheless to seek Congressional approval for a bailout and began working with Summers to secure commitments from Congress.

Motivated to deter a potential surge in illegal immigration and to mitigate the spread of investors&#x27; lack of confidence in Mexico to other developing countries, the United States coordinated a $50 billion bailout package in January 1995, to be administered by the IMF with support from the G7 and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The package established loan guarantees for Mexican public debt aimed at alleviating its growing risk premia and boosting investor confidence in its economy. The Mexican economy experienced a severe recession and the peso&#x27;s value deteriorated substantially despite the bailout&#x27;s success in preventing a worse collapse. Growth did not resume until the late 1990s.

The conditionality of the bailout required the Mexican government to institute new monetary and fiscal policy controls, although the country refrained from balance of payments reforms such as trade protectionism and strict capital controls to avoid violating its commitments under NAFTA. The loan guarantees allowed Mexico to restructure its short-term public debt and improve market liquidity. Of the approximately assembled in the bailout, was contributed by the United States, by the IMF, by the BIS, by a consortium of Latin American nations, and CAD$1 billion by Canada.

The Clinton administration&#x27;s efforts to organize a bailout for Mexico were met with difficulty. It drew criticism from members of the U.S. Congress as well as scrutiny from the news media. The administration&#x27;s position centered on three principal concerns: potential unemployment in the United States in the event Mexico would have to reduce its imports of U.S. goods (at the time, Mexico was the third-largest consumer of U.S. exports); political instability and violence in a neighboring country; and a potential surge in illegal immigration from Mexico. Some congressional representatives agreed with American economist and former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, L. William Seidman, that Mexico should just negotiate with creditors without involving the United States, especially in the interest of deterring moral hazard. On the other hand, supporters of U.S. involvement such as Fed Chair Alan Greenspan argued that the fallout from a Mexican sovereign default would be so devastating that it would far exceed the risks of moral hazard.

Following the U.S. Congress&#x27;s failure to pass the Mexican Stabilization Act, the Clinton administration reluctantly approved an initially dismissed proposal to designate funds from the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s Exchange Stabilization Fund as loan guarantees for Mexico. These loans returned a handsome profit of $600 million and were even repaid ahead of maturity. Then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin&#x27;s appropriation of funds from the Exchange Stabilization Fund in support of the Mexican bailout was scrutinized by the United States House Committee on Financial Services, which expressed concern about a potential conflict of interest because Rubin had formerly served as co-chair of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs, which had a substantial share in distributing Mexican stocks and bonds.

==Economic impacts==
Mexico&#x27;s economy experienced a severe recession as a result of the peso&#x27;s devaluation and the flight to safer investments. The country&#x27;s GDP declined by 6.2% over the course of 1995. Mexico&#x27;s financial sector bore the brunt of the crisis as banks collapsed, revealing low-quality assets and fraudulent lending practices. Thousands of mortgages went into default as Mexican citizens struggled to keep pace with rising interest rates, resulting in widespread repossession of houses.

In addition to declining GDP growth, Mexico experienced severe inflation and extreme poverty skyrocketed as real wages plummeted and unemployment nearly doubled. Prices increased by 35% in 1995. Nominal wages were sustained, but real wages fell by 25-35% over the same year. Unemployment climbed to 7.4% in 1995 from its pre-crisis level of 3.9% in 1994. In the formal sector alone, over one million people lost their jobs and average real wages decreased by 13.5% throughout 1995. Overall household incomes plummeted by 30% in the same year. Mexico&#x27;s extreme poverty grew to 37% in 1996 from 21% in 1994, undoing the previous ten years of successful poverty reduction initiatives. The nation&#x27;s poverty levels would not begin returning to normal until 2001.

Mexico&#x27;s growing poverty affected urban areas more intensely than rural areas, in part due to the urban population&#x27;s sensitivity to labor market volatility and macroeconomic conditions. Urban citizens relied on a healthy labor market, access to credit, and consumer goods. Consumer price inflation and a tightening credit market during the crisis proved challenging for urban workers, while rural households shifted to subsistence agriculture. Mexico&#x27;s gross income per capita decreased by only 17% in agriculture, contrasted with 48% in the financial sector and 35% in the construction and commerce industries. Average household consumption declined by 15% from 1995 to 1996 with a shift in composition toward essential goods. Households saved less and spent less on healthcare. Expatriates living abroad increased remittances to Mexico, evidenced by average net unilateral transfers doubling between 1994 and 1996.

Households&#x27; lower demand for primary healthcare led to a 7% hike in mortality rates among infants and children in 1996 (from 5% in 1995). Infant mortality increased until 1997, most dramatically in regions where women had to work as a result of economic need.

Critical scholars contend that the 1994 Mexican peso crisis exposed the problems of Mexico’s neoliberal turn to the Washington consensus approach to development. Notably, the crisis revealed the problems of a privatized banking sector within a liberalized yet internationally subordinate economy that is dependent on foreign flows of finance capital.

<doc id="769655" wikidata="Q3195010" url="?curid=769655" title="Ken Anderson (quarterback)">
<text>Kenneth Allan Anderson (born February 15, 1949) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL), spending his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals. He later returned as a position coach.

After playing college football for the Augustana Vikings, Anderson was selected in the third round of the 1971 NFL draft by the Bengals. Over the course of his 16-season NFL career, Anderson led the league in passer rating four times, completion percentage three times and passing yards twice. In 1981, he was awarded NFL Most Valuable Player and NFL Offensive Player of the Year, a season in which he led the Bengals to their first Super Bowl appearance. In 1982, Anderson set an NFL record for completion percentage of 70.6%—which stood for over 25 years until broken by Drew Brees in 2009.

As of the end of the 2024 NFL season, Anderson holds the Bengals franchise passing records in yards.

After his professional playing career, Anderson served as a radio broadcaster for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1987 to 1993. From 1993 to 2002, he served as the Bengals quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. Anderson later became the quarterbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars (2003–2006) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2007–2009), before retiring in 2010.

Anderson has been a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame three times, and is often regarded as one of the best players not in the Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Batavia, Illinois. Growing up in Batavia, Anderson&#x27;s backyard adjoined his friend, Dan Issel’s back yard. Anderson&#x27;s father was a janitor at Batavia High School, and the Issel property on Harrison Street backed onto that of the Andersons&#x27; on Republic Road. Growing up together, Issel and Anderson rode in Issel&#x27;s red Ford convertible and frequented the Twin Elms restaurant. Later, Anderson and Issel would co-own a 782-acre farm in Kentucky. Another neighbor and teammate, Byron Von Hoff, played basketball and other sports at Batavia with Anderson and Issel. Issel became a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame
basketball player with the Kentucky Colonels and Denver Nuggets. Von Hoff was the second round pick of the New York Mets in the 1966 
Amateur Baseball draft and pitched successfully in the minor leagues before an injury ended his career. Another friend and teammate at Batavia was future NBA announcer Craig Sager.

==Professional career==
After playing for and graduating from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, Anderson was selected 67th overall in the 1971 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals, where he would soon become noted for his short-range passes and running. Anderson made four starts in the 1971 season while playing in seven other games (Virgil Carter was the primary quarterback) in a year where the Bengals fell off from a productive previous season. He rushed for 125 yards on 22 total carries for one touchdown while being sacked 23 times. However, Anderson was given more rein in 1972, going 7–6 as a starter with 1,918 yards for seven touchdowns and interceptions while having a 56.8 completion percentage. With 22 carries, he also ran for 94 yards and three touchdowns while fumbling it five times and being sacked eighteen times. The Bengals started 5–2, but they only won three of their next seven to miss the playoffs.

The 1973 season proved better, as Anderson went 10–4 as a starter and threw for 2,428 yards while having eighteen touchdowns to twelve interceptions and had a 54.4 completion percentage, with Anderson helping to lead them to the AFC Central Division title with a six-game winning streak. In the playoffs that year, they were tasked to play the defending champion Miami Dolphins in the Orange Bowl. Special teams helped negate a bad start on offense that meant the Bengals only trailed 21–16 at halftime. However, the Dolphins pressed the Bengals for thirteen unanswered points to win 34–16, aided by a running attack that ran for over 200 yards on Cincinnati&#x27;s defense. Anderson went 14-of-27 for 113 yards and one interception.

In 1974 Anderson threw for a league high in completions, completion percentage (64.9), yards (2,667) and passer rating (95.7) while going for eighteen touchdowns to ten interceptions, but the Bengals went 7–6 in his thirteen starts. In 1975, Anderson threw for a league high 3,169 yards while throwing for 21 touchdowns to eleven interceptions for a 60.5 completion percentage. He had league highs in yards gained per pass attempt, yards per game and passer rating while being named to his first Pro Bowl and leading the Bengals to a 10–3 record (John Reaves started and won a game without Anderson). One of the finest performances of his early career was in a Monday Night Football game against the Buffalo Bills in November 1975; Anderson passed for a franchise record 447 yards while the Bengals racked up a franchise record 553 offensive yards in a It was the Bengals&#x27; first ever win in a Monday night game. With Bill Walsh as his quarterbacks coach, Anderson was one of the first quarterbacks to run what would become known as the &quot;West Coast Offense&quot;. The Bengals won the AFC Central for the second time in three seasons, but they were tasked to play against the Oakland Raiders away from their stadium (as per the NFL&#x27;s policy of rotating playoff hosts by year). Anderson went 17-of-27 for 201 yards for two touchdowns. However, the Raiders out-dueled the Bengals with better rushing and time, as they only punted once during the entire game (along with committing two turnovers), and they held on despite nearly blowing a ten-point lead in the fourth quarter to win 31–28. It was the last season with Paul Brown as coach, as he tapped Bill &quot;Tiger&quot; Johnson to replace him, but it was also the last with Walsh with the Bengals, as he left for the San Diego Chargers soon after.

In 1976, Anderson&#x27;s Bengals won nine of their first eleven games, but the wheels fell off shortly after with them losing two of their next three, which included two losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers, for which the division rival slipped by with a spot due to tiebreakers while the Bengals stayed home. Despite this, Anderson had a Pro Bowl caliber year, throwing for 2,367 yards with nineteen touchdowns and fourteen interceptions for a 10–4 record, although his passer rating and completion percentage all dropped considerably. Anderson and the Bengals regressed in 1977. He went 7–6 as a starter (Reaves played and won his only start), throwing for 2,145 yards with eleven touchdowns and interceptions, but the Bengals still had a chance to make the postseason on the final week. Needing to beat the Houston Oilers, Anderson threw 8-of-23 for 97 yards and one touchdown while being tackled for a safety in an ugly game where the two teams combined for five fumbles and the Oilers won 21–16 to keep the Bengals out of the playoffs.

In 1978, Anderson broke a bone in his right hand, and he did not play in the first four games. The Bengals lost all four with Reaves as quarterback, and Johnson quit as coach after an 0–5 start. Anderson went 4–8 as quarterback, but he passed for 2,219 yards with ten touchdowns and 22 interceptions (a career high). In the 1979 season, Anderson went 4–11 as a starter while throwing for 2,340 yards with sixteen touchdowns and ten interceptions while leading the league with 46 sacks. Anderson went 5–7 as a starter in 1980 with 1,778 yards passing, which was the least he threw as a primary starter. He had just six touchdowns to go with thirteen interceptions.

The 1981 season was the reckoning for Anderson. In the Bengals&#x27; opening game against the Seattle Seahawks, Anderson was intercepted twice in the first half and the Seahawks built up a 21–0 first quarter lead. In the second half, with the Bengals trailing 21–10, Cincinnati coach Forrest Gregg benched Anderson and brought in third-string quarterback Turk Schonert (second-string quarterback Jack Thompson was injured at the time). With Schonert in command of the offense, the Bengals stormed back and won the game 27–21. Despite the benching, Anderson would start every game of the whole season. He threw for a career high 3,754 yards while having 29 touchdowns to ten interceptions while leading the league in touchdown/interception percentage along with passer rating (98.4). Anderson also gained another 320 yards and one touchdown on the ground. This performance earned him both the Associated Press and Professional Football Writers of America NFL Most Valuable Player Awards and the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. The Bengals went 12–4 and won the AFC Central and the #1 seed in the American Football Conference. Anderson first faced the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional round. He went 14-of-21 for 192 yards with one touchdown as the Bengals outdueled the Bills 28–21, with Anderson&#x27;s touchdown pass to Cris Collinsworth with 10:39 remaining being the winning score. Anderson and the Bengals had their first postseason win and thus were slated to host the AFC Championship Game. Facing off against future Hall of Famer Dan Fouts and the San Diego Chargers, the game was referred to later as the Freezer Bowl, owing to conditions of −9 °F in Cincinnati on gameday. Anderson lived up to the challenge on the frozen tundra, passing 14-of-22 for 161 yards for two touchdowns as the Bengals led for the entire game and won 27–7 to win their first ever conference championship. In Super Bowl XVI, the Bengals played the San Francisco 49ers, now led by former coach Walsh in a matchup of the two best teams in the NFL. Anderson ended the first drive of the game with an interception, and the 49ers responded with a touchdown six minutes later. The Bengals committed two further turnovers that led to ten subsequent points as the 49ers roared to a 20–0 halftime lead. Anderson led them to a touchdown on the first drive of the second half. The Bengals tried to drive into the endzone midway through the third, but they were stuffed one yard short of the end zone that kept the score 20–7. Despite this, the Bengals made it 20–14 on a touchdown drive capped by an Anderson throw with ten minutes remaining. Five minutes later, trailing 23–14, Anderson threw an interception that led to a subsequent field goal for San Francisco. With two minutes left, Anderson did lead the Bengals on a touchdown drive of 74 yards, but by the time Anderson&#x27;s throw to the end zone had occurred, there were just twenty seconds left as the 49ers hung on to win 26–21. Anderson completed 25-of-34 passes for 300 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions while having fourteen rushing yards and a touchdown on five rushing attempts. At the time, his 25 completions and 73.5% completion percentage were both Super Bowl records.

In the strike-shortened 1982 season, Anderson led the Bengals to a 7–2 record, good for third overall in the AFC. He threw for 2,495 yards with twelve touchdowns to nine interceptions while leading the league in completions, completion percentage (70.6) and passer rating (95.3). In the playoffs that year, they were upset by the New York Jets at home, with Anderson going 26-of-35 for 354 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions in the 44–17 loss. 1983, the Bengals started by going 2–6 in the first half of the season before finishing 7–9 in Forrest Gregg&#x27;s final season as head coach. Anderson played in thirteen games and went 5–8 while leading the league in completion percentage again while throwing 2,333 yards with twelve touchdowns and thirteen interceptions. The 1984 season was his last primary year as quarterback, and he played in just nine games as starter (with two other appearances), going 3–6. He threw for 2,107 yards with ten touchdowns to twelve interceptions while having a 63.6 completion percentage. He was replaced by Boomer Esiason after the first two games of the 1985 season (having gone 14-of-28 for 156 yards in two games combined)., and he retired after the 1986 season.

In his 16 NFL seasons, Anderson completed 2,654 of 4,475 passes (59.3%) for 32,838 yards and 197 touchdowns and 160 interceptions and also gained 2,220 rushing yards and scored twenty rushing touchdowns on 397 carries. His completions, passing yards, and touchdown passes are all Bengals records. His 2,220 rushing yards are the most ever by a Bengals quarterback. Anderson led the NFL in quarterback rating four times during his career (1974, 1975, 1981, and 1982) and led the league in passing yards twice (1974, 1975). He was selected to four Pro Bowls (1975–76 &amp; 1981–82). Anderson was voted All-Pro in 1981, 2nd Team All-Pro in 1975, and 2nd Team All-AFC in 1974 and 1982. Anderson retired with a 91–81 record as a starter, which is good for 32nd as a starting quarterback all-time (beating out quarterbacks of his time such as Dan Fouts and Roger Staubach).

===Legacy===
Anderson finished his career seventh all-time in passing yards (with five of those above him already in the Pro Football Hall of Fame at that time).

While many of his records have since been broken, Anderson held NFL records for consecutive pass completions (twenty), completion percentage for a single game (20-of-22, 90.9%, vs. Pittsburgh in 1974) and completion percentage for a season (70.6% in 1982), as well as the Super Bowl records for completion percentage (73.5%) (since broken by Phil Simms) and completions (25; Tom Brady holds the current record with 43). While Anderson&#x27;s record for regular season completion percentage happened in a strike-shortened nine-game season, the previous record he surpassed had been set by Sammy Baugh in a ten-game season (1945), in which Baugh threw 125 fewer passes then Anderson did in 1982. Furthermore, Anderson was ranked seventh all-time for passing yards in a career at the time of his retirement. Anderson&#x27;s record for completion percentage in a season stood for 27 years (broken by Drew Brees in 2009). He led the NFL in passing yards and completions twice, and led the league in fewest interceptions per pass attempt three times. He ranks eleventh in NFL history for postseason passer rating at 93.5.

An argument has been made in comparing Anderson&#x27;s stats as comparable to ones of his time that have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, such as Dan Fouts. &quot;Football Outsiders&quot; pointed out that in the time of 1973–1984, the two had similar completions and completion percentage while having different touchdowns/interceptions (Fouts threw for more of both) while noting Anderson&#x27;s dominance over Fouts in rushing (over 2,000 yards for sixteen touchdowns to Fouts&#x27; 480 for eleven). Although most of the quarterbacks to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame have won at least one NFL/AFL Championship or a Super Bowl, there have been just eight to have been inducted who did not win a title, and Fouts is one of them. With stats compiled of fellow 1970s quarterback Ken Stabler, Anderson outranks him in games played/started, yards, touchdowns (197 to 194) along with less interceptions (160 to 222). Among quarterbacks to have been the primary starter at the position, Anderson is tied for the second most seasons (thirteen, with Jim Hart) at the position of those eligible for the Hall of Fame to not be inducted (Vinny Testaverde with fifteen is the most). In 2023, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that Anderson is placed higher on &quot;Pro Football Reference&quot;’s “Hall of Fame Monitor” metric than several quarterbacks who are already in the Hall of Fame, notably including Troy Aikman, Sonny Jurgensen, Len Dawson, Bob Griese, and others.

In terms of AFC Central competition, Anderson went 41–34 in appearances and 36–30 in starts overall against division rivals in the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and the Houston Oilers. The toughest rival proved to be Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw and the Steelers, who won nine division titles in Anderson&#x27;s era while he won three himself. In sixteen starts against Bradshaw, he went 8–8.

==Coaching career==
Anderson served as a color analyst for the Bengals’ radio broadcasts from 1987 to 1992. In 1993 he re-joined the team as their quarterbacks coach, a position he held until 1996. He then served as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator from 1996 to 2000, and again as the team&#x27;s quarterbacks coach in 2001 and 2002 he was fired after a poor record with all-time draft bust Akili Smith. In 2003, he became a wide receivers coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and was their quarterbacks coach. He was fired after the 2006 season, along with offensive coordinator Carl Smith and special teams coach Pete Rodriguez, by Jack Del Rio. In January 2007, new Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin hired Anderson as his quarterbacks coach under offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. On January 5, 2010, Tomlin announced that Anderson would be retiring, effective immediately. Anderson earned a Super Bowl ring when the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII.

==Honors==

O&#x27;Donnell wore number 12 during his one-year stay in Cincinnati, the only time in his NFL career he did not wear number 14. With Anderson&#x27;s approval, Andy Dalton wore number 14 for the duration of his Bengals career. 
* He has been nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame several times, and on two occasions was among the 15 finalists for enshrinement (1996 and 1998). he was a finalist a third time for the senior committee in 2023 but missed out on being one of the final three. In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Anderson to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011.
* In 2008, NFL Network selected Anderson as No. 10 on their list of top 10 players who had not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<text>Loni Anderson (born August 5, 1945) is an American actress. She played receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982), which earned her three Golden Globe Awards and two Emmy Award nominations.

== Early life ==
Anderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of Klaydon Carl &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, an environmental chemist, and Maxine Hazel (née Kallin), a model. She grew up in suburban Roseville, Minnesota. As a senior at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School, she was voted Queen of the Valentine&#x27;s Day Winter Formal of 1963. As she states in her autobiography &quot;My Life in High Heels&quot;, her father was going to name her Leilani, but realized that when she got to her teen years, it was likely to be twisted (into &quot;Lay&quot; Lani) so it was changed to simply Loni.

== Career ==
Her acting debut came with a bit part in the film &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), starring Steve McQueen. After that, she was mostly unemployed as an actress for nearly a decade, then she received guest roles on television series in the mid-1970s. She appeared in two episodes of &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, then on the sitcom &quot;Phyllis&quot;, and the detective series &quot;Police Woman&quot; and &quot;Harry O&quot;.

She auditioned for the role of Chrissy on the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. She did not win the role, but in 1978 guest-starred as Susan Walters on a season two episode, an appearance that brought her to the attention of the ABC network.

Anderson&#x27;s most famous acting role came as the sultry receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982). She was offered the role when producers saw a poster of her in a red swimsuit—a pose similar to Farrah Fawcett&#x27;s famous 1976 poster. Hugh Wilson, the sitcom&#x27;s creator, later said Anderson got the role because her body resembled Jayne Mansfield&#x27;s and because she possessed the innocent sexuality of Marilyn Monroe.

Although the series suffered in the Nielsen ratings throughout most of its four-year run, it had a strong following among teens, young adults, and disc jockeys. Owing to her rising popularity as the series&#x27; so-called &quot;main attraction&quot;, Anderson walked out on the sitcom during the 1980 summer hiatus, requesting a substantial salary increase. While she was renegotiating her contract, she starred in the television film &quot;The Jayne Mansfield Story&quot; (1980). When the network agreed to her requests, she returned to the series and remained until its cancellation in 1982. 

Aside from her acting career, Anderson has become known for her colorful personal life, particularly her relationship with and marriage to actor Burt Reynolds. They starred in the comedy film &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; (1983), which was a critical and box-office failure. She later appeared as herself in the romantic comedy &quot;The Lonely Guy&quot; (1984), starring Steve Martin. She voiced Flo, a collie in the animated film &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; (1989).
In the mid-to-late 1980s, Anderson was teamed with &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; actress Lynda Carter in the television series &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; in 1984. She appeared in television adaptations of classic Hollywood films, such as &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1985) with Michele Lee, and &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; (1989), both of which received little attention. After starring in &quot;Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1990), Anderson received considerable praise for her portrayal of comedian actress Thelma Todd in the television movie &quot;White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd&quot; (1991). In the early 1990s, she attempted to co-star with her husband Burt Reynolds on his sitcom &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, but the network was not fond of the idea, thus replacing Anderson with Marilu Henner. After Delta Burke was fired from the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; in 1991, producers offered Anderson a role as Burke&#x27;s replacement, which never came to pass because the network refused to pay Anderson the salary she had requested. She agreed to return as Jennifer Marlowe on two episodes of &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, a sequel to the original series. In 1993, Anderson was added to the third season of the sitcom &quot;Nurses&quot;, playing hospital administrator Casey MacAffee. Although her entering the series was an attempt to boost the series&#x27; ratings, the series was canceled shortly thereafter.

In April 2018, Anderson was seen promoting &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; and other television series on the MeTV television network.

Though less frequent since the start of the 21st century, Anderson continues to act in television series, and played a lead role in the 2016–2020 web series &quot;My Sister is So Gay&quot;.

On October 3, 2023, it was announced that Anderson would feature in the Lifetime film, &quot;Ladies of the &#x27;80s: A Divas Christmas&quot;. According to the official synopsis, the movie follows five soap opera divas readying for a reunion show who take on playing cupid during Christmas to bring together their director and producer as they all learn the meaning of the true Christmas spirit. The ensemble cast is made up of Anderson, Linda Gray, Morgan Fairchild, Donna Mills, and Nicollette Sheridan.

== Personal life ==
Anderson has been married four times. Her first three husbands were real estate developer Bruce Hasselberg (1964–1966), actor Ross Bickell (1974–1981), and actor Burt Reynolds (1988–1994). On May 17, 2008, she married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four. They had originally met at a movie premiere in Minneapolis in 1963.

Anderson has two children: a daughter, Deidra (fathered by Hasselberg), and a son, Quinton, whom she and Reynolds adopted. She also has a sister, Andrea. Anderson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Life in High Heels&quot; was published in 1995.

Growing up with parents who both smoked, Anderson witnessed the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease often caused by smoking. In 1999, she became a spokesperson for a COPD support organization named COPD Together.

<text>Ottis Jerome Anderson (born January 19, 1957) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Giants. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, setting the school record for rushing yards, and was selected eighth overall in the 1979 NFL draft by the Cardinals.

In his first season, Anderson was named Offensive Rookie of the Year and received Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors when he set the Cardinals all-time record for rushing yards. He also received a second Pro Bowl selection the following year. Traded to the Giants in 1986 amid a production decline, Anderson won two Super Bowl titles in Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV. Anderson was named MVP of the latter, in which he played a central part in helping the Giants set the Super Bowl record for time of possession.

==Early life==
Ottis Jerome Anderson was born and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was a football and track star at Forest Hill High School in West Palm Beach, graduating in 1975.

==College career==

Anderson attended the University of Miami on a full athletic scholarship and earned a degree in Physical Education. During his college career, Anderson broke Chuck Foreman&#x27;s career rushing records at the University of Miami, becoming the first player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in the school&#x27;s history his senior year with 1,266 yards. He received honorable mention as an All-American by the Associated Press, and graduated in 1979 as the team&#x27;s all-time leading rusher with 3,331 yards.

Anderson was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1990.

===Statistics===
==Professional career==
Anderson was selected in the first round of the 1979 NFL draft, the 8th overall pick, by the St. Louis Cardinals. He had one of the greatest debut games in NFL history, rushing for 193 yards, which was just 1 yard shy of Alan Ameche&#x27;s all-time record for an NFL debut (Ameche rushed for 194 yards for the Baltimore Colts in 1955). His single season 1,605 rushing yard performance was one of the few bright spots in the Cardinals&#x27; 1979 season, when they finished 5–11. He earned the first of back-to-back Pro Bowl selections that year.

In his first six seasons, Anderson rushed for over 1,000 yards in five seasons. The lone exception was in the 1982 strike-shortened season, when he rushed for 587 yards in eight games; a pace for well over 1,000 yards in a full 16-game season.

The Cardinals made the playoffs in 1982, thanks to an expanded field due to the brevity of the season. It was the franchise&#x27;s first postseason appearance since 1975 and last until 1998. Anderson rushed for 58 yards on eight carries against the Green Bay Packers in the team&#x27;s lone playoff game.

Injuries drastically decreased the number of games Anderson played each season, and his explosiveness as a tailback. After a year and a half, Stump Mitchell emerged as the Cards&#x27; top running back, and the expendable Anderson was traded to the New York Giants in the middle of the 1986 season. He ended up deep in the Giants&#x27; depth chart. By this time in his career, it was clear that he was better used in goal line or short yardage situations. Anderson would rush for only six yards on seven carries in the 1986 playoffs, but did score a rushing touchdown in the Giants&#x27; victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.

In his first two and a half seasons with New York, Anderson did not fumble once in his 100 offensive touches. In 1989, Anderson become the top running back for Bill Parcells&#x27; ball control offense and was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He scored a career-high 14 rushing touchdowns and rushed for 1,023 yards on 325 carries. He was also the top running back for the Giants the following year when they won Super Bowl XXV, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his 102 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. As a testament to the Giants&#x27; ball control strategy, their time of possession was double that of the Buffalo Bills, their opponents, in the first Super Bowl without a turnover. Anderson is one of only four running backs in NFL history to score rushing touchdowns in two Super Bowls and win Super Bowl MVP (only Franco Harris and John Riggins accomplished this feat before Anderson, and only Emmitt Smith has achieved it since).

Anderson was replaced by Rodney Hampton in 1991. His last season was 1992. Anderson fumbled just three times in 739 touches as a Giant, from 1987 to 1992.

When he retired, Anderson ranked seventh in rushing TDs and eighth in rushing yards. At the 2014 season, Anderson was ranked 19th in career rushing touchdowns and is one of 31 running backs in the history of the NFL to rush for more than 10,000 yards (currently ranked 30th in career rushing yards at the conclusion of the 2019 NFL season).

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Life after football==
The end of Anderson&#x27;s 14-year football career in 1993 marked the beginning of his career in entrepreneurship and motivational speaking.

Anderson has appeared on several major local and national radio and television shows, including &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. He appeared on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Tosh.0&quot; during the Crying Giants&#x27; Fan Web Redemption. Chris Cuomo of ABC News interviewed Anderson as part of &quot;One Moment in Time: The Life of Whitney Houston&quot;, a two-hour special on ABC shortly after the death of singer Whitney Houston. In Super Bowl XXV, Houston performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and Anderson and then-Giants quarterback Jeff Hostetler, along with then-Buffalo Bills quarterback Frank Reich, reflected on Houston&#x27;s performance in that game.

He was a broadcast analyst with WFAN for the New York Giants, and he co-hosted three radio shows in St. Louis with former Cardinal teammates Theotis Brown, E.J. Junior and Roy Green. Anderson was a frequent guest on &quot;The Billy Taylor Show&quot; in New York City and contributed to an in-season weekly column, &quot;Ask Ottis&quot;, in the &quot;Giants Insider&quot; publication.

As president of Ottis J. Anderson Enterprises, Anderson is also involved in several ventures and is involved with writing benefits for municipalities, school boards and privately held businesses in New Jersey. In 2017, Anderson began working as the Vice President of Business Development for Metro Exhibits, selling trade show booths and services. He has endorsed Global Syn-Turf, Inc. synthetic turf for sports fields.

Anderson has been affiliated with many community organizations such as the United Way of America, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the Deborah Hospital Foundation.

Anderson was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame on May 2, 2022.

<doc id="769668" wikidata="Q1377263" url="?curid=769668" title="Powis Castle">
<text>Powis Castle () is a medieval castle, fortress and grand country house near Welshpool, in Powys, Wales. The seat of the Herbert family, earls of Powis, the castle is known for its formal gardens and for its interiors, the former having been described as &quot;the most important&quot;, and the latter &quot;the most magnificent&quot;, in the country. The castle and gardens are under the care of the National Trust. Powis Castle is a Grade I listed building, while its gardens have their own Grade I listing on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

The present castle was built in the 13th century. Unusually for a castle on the Marches, it was constructed by a Welsh prince, Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, rather than by a Norman baron. Gruffydd was prince of the ancient Kingdom of Powys and maintained an alliance with the English king Edward I during the struggles of the later 13th century. He was able to secure the position of his son, Owain, although the kingdom itself was abolished by the Parliament of Shrewsbury in 1283. After his father&#x27;s death, Owain was raised to the peerage as Owen de la Pole, 1st Lord of Powis. Following his own death , and the death of his only son, he was succeeded by his daughter, Hawys Gadarn, &quot;the Lady of Powis&quot;. Hawys married Sir John Charlton in 1309.

In the late 16th century the castle was purchased by Edward Herbert, a younger son of William Herbert, 1st earl of Pembroke, beginning a connection between the family and the castle that continues today. The Herberts remained Roman Catholic until the 18th century and, although rising in the peerage to earls, marquesses and Jacobite dukes of Powis, suffered periods of imprisonment and exile. Despite these setbacks, they were able in the late 17th and early 18th centuries to transform Powis from a border fortress into an aristocratic country house, and surround it with one of the very few extant examples of a British Baroque garden.

In 1784 Henrietta Herbert married Edward Clive, eldest son of Clive of India, a match which replenished the much-depleted Herbert family fortune. In the early 20th century, George Herbert, 4th Earl of Powis redeveloped the castle with the assistance of the architect George Frederick Bodley. Herbert’s wife, Violet, undertook work of equal importance in the garden, seeking to turn it into &quot;one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, in England and Wales&quot;. On the 4th Earl&#x27;s death in 1952, his wife and his sons having predeceased him, the castle passed into the care of the National Trust.

==History==
===First castles at Welshpool: 1111–1286===
Unlike the castles at Conwy, Caernarfon, Harlech and nearby Montgomery, which were built by the English to subdue the Welsh, the castles at Welshpool were built by the Welsh princes of Powys Wenwynwyn as their dynastic seat. In addition to the current site, two motte-and-bailey castles and a set of earthworks are located nearby. The names &quot;Trallwg/Tallwm&quot; and &quot;Pola&quot; are used interchangeably in early primary sources, and it is unclear which of these sites is being referred to.

The earliest reference dates from 1111, when Cadwgan ap Bleddyn is mentioned as having planned to construct a castle at Trallwng Llywelyn, the oldest record of a native Welsh castle. Domen Castell, a motte-and-bailey near the modern railway station, is considered the most likely site of Cadwgan&#x27;s castle, although it is uncertain whether it was completed as he was assassinated the same year. The first documentary account of an extant castle at Welshpool is a description of the successful 1196 siege by an English army, although the castle was retaken by the Welsh within the year.

The earliest castle at the current site may have been a timber building constructed by Owain Cyfeiliog or his son, Gwenwynwyn (). The present masonry structure contains 13th-century fabric, most likely the work of Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn () – although historians are uncertain when this took place. In 1274, Gruffydd&#x27;s &quot;first castle&quot; at Welshpool was destroyed by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as punishment for his involvement in a scheme to assassinate Llywelyn. The castle was documented again in 1286, when it was listed amongst Gruffydd&#x27;s possessions as &quot;la Pole Castr&quot;. A detailed examination of Powis Castle&#x27;s extant masonry carried out between 1987 and 1989 revealed early stonework incorporated into the later structure, putatively the remains of an early stone shell keep. At the end of Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales in 1282–83, the king permitted Gruffydd to rebuild his castle at Welshpool as a reward for his loyalty.

===Early history: 1286–1644===

In 1286, four years after the conquest of Wales, Gruffydd&#x27;s son, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn became the last hereditary prince of Powys when he renounced his royal title, and was granted the barony of de la Pole, (i.e. &quot;of the Pool&quot;, a reference to Welshpool, formerly called just &quot;Pool&quot;). The ancient Kingdom of Powys had once included the counties of Montgomeryshire, much of Denbighshire, parts of Radnorshire and large areas of Shropshire, but by the 13th century had been reduced to two independent principalities – Powys Wenwynwyn and Powys Fadog – roughly equivalent to Montgomeryshire and South Denbighshire (plus Maelor Saesneg), respectively; Welshpool had become the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn, of which Owain had been heir. On the death of Owain, the castle passed to his daughter Hawys, who married Sir John Charlton. The Charltons continued to live at Powis until the fifteenth century when two daughters, Joyce Tiptoft and Joan Grey inherited the castle and estates. Both were equally divided, each daughter and her husband living in a portion of the castle.

In 1578 an illegitimate son of the last Baron Grey of Powis, began leasing the lordship and castle to a distant relative – Sir Edward Herbert (d. 1595), second son of Sir William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Edward eventually bought the castle outright in 1587, beginning the connection between the Herberts and Powis Castle which continues today. Sir Edward&#x27;s wife was a Roman Catholic and the family&#x27;s allegiance to Rome and to the Stuart kings was to shape its destiny for over a century. Sir Edward began the transformation of Powis from a border fortress into an Elizabethan country house. The major remaining element of his work is the Long Gallery.

Herbert&#x27;s descendent William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis (), was a supporter of Charles I, and was granted the barony of Powis in 1629. His loyalty during the English Civil War cost him his castle and his estates. On 22 October 1644 Powis Castle was captured by Parliamentary troops and was not returned to the family until the restoration of Charles II in 1660.

===The Herberts: 1660–1800===

On the restoration, the Herberts returned to Powis, and in 1674 William Herbert () was created Earl of Powis (of the first creation). The state bedroom was installed in about 1665 and further improvements, including the construction of the Great Staircase followed in the 1670s. These developments were most probably carried out under the direction of William Winde, who may also have designed the terraced gardens. His employer, although restored to his estates, and raised in the peerage, was barred by his Catholic faith from high office under Charles II. On the accession of the King&#x27;s brother, James in 1685, Herbert became one of the new king&#x27;s chief ministers, and was again advanced in the peerage becoming Marquess of Powis in 1687, but fell at the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and followed James into exile in France. William III granted the castle to his nephew, William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford. Herbert died, still in exile, in 1696.

Despite their 30-year exile, the Herberts were able to continue with developments at the castle and even to live there on an irregular basis, the Baroque water garden below the castle being completed at this time. Their fortunes were also materially improved by the discovery of a lucrative lead mine on their Welsh estates. The second Marquess, also William, was reinstated in 1722. On the death of his son, the third Marquess in 1748, the marquessate became extinct, while the castle and estates passed to a relative, Henry Herbert (), of Oakly Park in Shropshire, who was made 1st Earl of Powis (of the second creation) by George II. Herbert married Barbara, the fifteen-year-old granddaughter of the 2nd Marquess, in 1751. Their eldest son, George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis (1755–1801), died unmarried and the earldom of the second creation became extinct. Powis was much neglected during his tenure. John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington, a diarist and traveller who chronicled his journeys into Wales in the 1780s and 1790s, described the castle in 1784, &quot;In the gardens not even the fruit is attended to; the balustrades and terraces are falling down, and the horses graze on the parterres!!!&quot; The castle itself was in no better condition, a visitor in 1774 describing it as &quot;in Neglect and Ruin&quot;. Nonetheless, the potential of the site was recognised. George Lyttelton, the politician, poet and essayist, recorded his impressions in 1756, &quot;About £3,000 laid out upon Powis Castle would make it the most august place in the Kingdom.&quot;

===The Clives and Herberts: 1801–1952===

In 1784, Henry Herbert&#x27;s daughter, Henrietta, married Edward Clive (1754–1839), the eldest son of Clive of India. Clive had followed his father to India, and served as Governor of Madras. Henrietta&#x27;s brother died in 1801, whereupon the title lapsed; in 1804, her husband was created first Earl of Powis (of the third creation). The Clive fortune paid for long overdue repairs to the castle, which were carried out by Sir Robert Smirke. Their son, Edward (1785–1848), inherited his late uncle&#x27;s Powis estates on his 21st birthday, taking the surname Herbert in compliance with his uncle&#x27;s will. Edward Herbert served in a range of administrations as an Anti-Catholic Tory, his speeches in the House of Commons being &quot;cautious and pertinent, although marred by dull delivery&quot;. He died in 1848, following a shooting accident at Powis in which he was fatally injured by his second son. No further major changes were made to the Powis estate during his time, or in the long tenure of his eldest son Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis (1818–1891), although the castle was well maintained. In honour of his great-grandfather, the earl was offered the viceroyalty of India by Benjamin Disraeli but declined, writing &quot;Not worth considering. Powis&quot; on the envelope containing the invitation.

The final alterations to Powis Castle were undertaken at the beginning of the 20th century by George Frederick Bodley for George Charles Herbert, 4th Earl of Powis (1862–1952). The rooms designed by Bodley remain his only extant decorative scheme; the longevity of the 4th Earl, the deaths of his heirs, and his bequest of the castle to the National Trust saw the early 20th-century remodelling remain largely unaltered. The 4th earl&#x27;s wife, Violet (nee Lane-Fox), undertook the final transformation of the gardens of Powis Castle, which she felt had the potential to be &quot;the most beautiful in England and Wales&quot;. The Countess died following a car accident in 1929, and Lord Powis outlived both his sons, who died on active service, Percy from wounds received at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, and Mervyn in a plane crash in 1943. On his own death in 1952, he bequeathed the castle and gardens to the National Trust.

===The National Trust: 1952–present===
The 4th earl was succeeded by his cousin, Edward Herbert, 5th Earl of Powis (1889–1974). Edward&#x27;s heir was Christian Herbert, 6th Earl of Powis (1904–1988). He was succeeded by his cousin, George Herbert, 7th Earl of Powis (1925–1993), who was in turn succeeded by his son, John, the 8th and current Earl. The Herbert family continue to live in part of the castle, under an arrangement with the National Trust. The Trust has undertaken a number of major works of restoration during its ownership, including the Marquess Gate, the Grand Staircase, and the sculpture of &quot;Fame&quot; in the Outer Courtyard.
The castle and its gardens receive around 200,000 visitors annually.

==Architecture and description==
===Exterior===
Entrance to the castle is made through an outer gatehouse, with the stables to the right and a coach house to the left. The medieval building history is complex; John R. Kenyon, in his study &quot;The Medieval Castles of Wales&quot;, notes that &quot;the accretion of later buildings and much modification, have made it notoriously difficult to interpret the early phasing.&quot; Continuing the run of buildings on the left is the North Range, with former domestic offices below and a ballroom above. The base of this block formed the outer bailey wall of the original castle.

The first floor of this range also contains the Clive Museum, which features artefacts brought from India by the Clives in the 18th century. The outer courtyard contains the lead statue of &quot;Fame&quot;, attributed to the workshop of John Nost (d. 1729). Originally located in the water gardens, the piece seems to have been struck from the same mould as the &quot;Pegasus and Fame&quot; supplied by van Nost between 1705 and 1716 to Sir Nicholas Shireburn at Stonyhurst, Lancashire. A grand staircase leads to the doorway to the main keep, sandwiched between two drum towers. The keep is entered at the other end through the Marquess Gate, a sequence of iron gates, followed by a flight of steps leading up to a Baroque doorcase. Their date of construction is uncertain; they may be from the time of the 1st Marquess in the late 17th century, or from the time of the 2nd Marquess in the early 18th century. Both entrances lead into the small Inner Courtyard. Originally with an open arcade, this was enclosed by Smirke in the 1820s. The keep contains the main living apartments of the Herberts, while the continuance of the North Range houses the kitchen and servants&#x27; quarters.

===Interiors===
Scourfield and Haslam, in their &quot;Powys&quot; volume of Pevsner&#x27;s &quot;The Buildings of Wales&quot;, describe the castle interiors as &quot;the most magnificent in Wales&quot;. They contain murals and ceiling paintings by Antonio Verrio and Gerard Lanscroon; a collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean family portraits mainly of members of the Herberts of Chirbury, who inherited the castle in the early 18th century; Carolean furnishings of notable richness and quality; and items from the picture and Indian collections of Robert Clive. The early 20th-century redevelopment and redecoration undertaken by George Bodley was sensitively handled, Scourfield and Haslam consider it &quot;appropriate and finely executed&quot;, and it is the only remaining, unaltered, example of his decorative approach. The work took from 1902 until Bodley&#x27;s death in 1907 and cost around £30,000.

====Great Staircase====
The great staircase was built , probably under the direction of William Winde. The ceiling painting is by Verrio, and likely depicts Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. Charles restored William Herbert to his Welsh estates and made him 1st Earl of Powis (of the first creation) in 1674. The painting&#x27;s inspiration is the &quot;Apotheosis of Venice&quot; in the Doge&#x27;s Palace, by Paolo Veronese. The staircase has been closed to visitors to the castle for many years, because of structural instability. In 2017 the Trust began fundraising efforts for restoration. A structural survey, undertaken in 2020, investigated whether the staircase vibrations, caused by visitor footfall, were the cause of damage to the wall and ceiling paintings. The report&#x27;s authors concluded that there was not a direct link, but emphasised the challenge of balancing the needs of visitors with the requirement to maintain historic fabrics.

====State Dining Room====

The dining room was created by Bodley by the re-amalgamation of two smaller rooms. The 4th Earl took a very close interest in Bodley&#x27;s work, and influenced much of the decoration. The chimneypieces in the room were copied from examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the ceiling from the Reindeer Inn, a public house in Banbury, both at the Earl&#x27;s suggestion. The room contains a portrait of Henrietta Clive, Countess of Powis (1758–1830), painted in 1777 by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The Countess was daughter of Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis and wife of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis. The hat and the lace scarf which she wears in the portrait are not shown in an engraving of the same subject dating to 1778 and appear to have been added later.

==== State Bedroom ====
A remarkable survival of the 1660s, the State Bedroom is the only remaining one in Britain where a balustrade separates the bed alcove from the rest of the room. The design demonstrates the desire of the Anglo-Welsh aristocracy to emulate the etiquette that regulated the court of Louis XIV at Versailles. The room is attributed to William Winde, at the time of his work on the gardens. When improvements to the castle were being considered in 1772, the architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard recommended that the bedroom be preserved. The bed itself dates from this period of reconstruction. The room was designed to receive Charles II, and is much decorated with the initials &quot;CR&quot;. The window latches in the shape of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers commemorate the visit of the future King Edward VII. His son and daughter-in-law (later King George V and Queen Mary), visited in 1909.

====Long Gallery====
The Long Gallery was built by Sir Edward Herbert, following his purchase of the castle in 1587. It is constructed to a &quot;T&quot;-plan, an unusual design for an Elizabethan long gallery. Displayed in the gallery is a marble group of a cat and snake. It is probably Roman, dating between the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD, although it could be an 18th-century fake. Representations of cats are rare in Roman art. The marble, quarried on Thasos was probably purchased by Clive of India for his wife on his visit to Italy in 1774. The gallery also contains a set of busts of the Roman Caesars. Their great weight led to their being moved from the Long Gallery by the Trust, because of concerns that they would lead the floor to collapse, but a full reconstruction of the floor has enabled them to be returned.

====Clive Museum====

When Robert Clive returned to England, his fortune of some £234,000 (£23 million today), made him the richest self-made man in Europe. According to William Dalrymple, much of the wealth amassed by Clive was loot that was illicitly collected after the Battle of Plassey. Several of Clive&#x27;s acquisitions are on display in the Clive Museum at Powis Castle, along with items acquired subsequently by Edward and Henrietta, during Edward&#x27;s time working firstly for the East India Company and then as the Governor of Madras. These include Tipu Sultan&#x27;s magnificent state tent, made of painted chintz; gold and bejewelled tiger&#x27;s head finials from Tipu&#x27;s throne; two cannons that are today positioned on either side of the castle entrance, and textiles, armour, weapons, bronzes, silver pieces, and collections of jade and ivory.

The Clive Museum, opened in 1987 next to the ballroom in the North Range, has been the focus of controversy in the 21st century, because of the raised awareness of the links between country house collections and colonialism, as a result of the Black Lives Matter movement. The National Trust has committed to supporting reinterpretation of the South Asian collection and in 2020 commissioned a research project in association with the Ashmolean Museum to investigate its history, contents and provenance.

===Listing designations===
In Wales Cadw is the statutory body with responsibility for the listing of buildings. Cadw uses the same rating system as Historic England, classifying listed buildings into three categories; Grade I, the highest grade, for buildings of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;, Grade II*, the next grade, for buildings of &quot;more than special interest&quot;, and Grade II, the lowest grade, for buildings of &quot;special interest&quot;. Powis Castle is a Grade I listed building. The Outer Gatehouse, the Marquess Gate, the Ballroom Range to the north of the Outer Courtyard and the retaining wall to the south, as well as the Top, Aviary, and Orangery Terraces all have separate Grade I listings. The statues of &quot;Fame&quot;, and of &quot;Hercules&quot; are listed Grade II*. The raised terrace to the south-east, the stone vase on the site of the water garden cascade, and the &quot;Peacock&quot; statue have Grade II designations as do a number of domestic offices, including the Ice House, the Bothy, the Garden House, four cottages, and a range of garden features.

==Gardens==

Elisabeth Whittle, the garden historian, considers the gardens at Powis to be &quot;the most important and magnificent [.] in Wales&quot;. They mainly survived the 18th-century reaction against the formality of earlier garden design, and are one of the few remaining Baroque gardens in the UK. Although their exact dating is uncertain, the terraces were hewn from the rock at some point between the 1670s and 1705 under the direction of William Winde and later Adrian Duvall, a French gardener from Rouen.

The concept of formal terraces was introduced into northern Europe from the gardens of 16th-century Italy. The gardens originally comprised six terraces, descending from the castle, and culminating in a water garden. Winde had earlier worked on a similar terraced layout at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, a design of which his patron was almost certainly aware. The castle gardens are listed Grade I on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales, their listing record describing them as the finest remaining Baroque gardens in Britain.

===The Water Garden===

Duvall may have had training in hydraulics, being responsible for the original water gardens, which were laid out in a Dutch style. Their design was almost certainly influenced by the gardens of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, outside Paris. The château was home to James II after his flight from England and was thus well known to the Marquess of Powis and his son. Its grounds were landscaped in an Italianate style comprising gravelled walks between parterres, with fountains and basins. By 1705, despite the Herberts&#x27; absence, the water garden was completed. John Bridgeman, a guest in that year, wrote &quot;the waterworks and fountains are much beyond anything I ever saw, the cascade has two falls of water which concludes in a noble Bason (sic).&quot;

The Powis water garden lasted just over 100 years, and was dismantled by 1809, on the advice of William Emes. Emes, who trained under Capability Brown, swept away the formal parterres and proposed the demolition of the terraces by explosives. The Earl rejected his advice regarding the terraces, although the lowest two were reduced to earthen banks, but permitted the replacement of the water garden with the Great Lawn. The water garden had comprised a series of pools and fountains, interspersed with flower beds and decorated with an array of statuary, a number of which, such as the &quot;Fame&quot; and the &quot;Hercules&quot; were relocated to different sites on the estate.

===The Terraces===

Four of the terraces remain, the last two having reverted to banks of earth covered with shrubs. Each is 150m in length. The Top Terrace is planted with a range of yew trees, a distinctive feature at Powis. Originally tightly clipped in the form of obelisks, they have grown into an array of amorphous shapes. The 14 &quot;tumps&quot; on the Top Terrace, and the hedge at its eastern end, were planted by the 2nd Marquess in the 1720s. The darker Irish yews elsewhere in the garden date from the following century. Below is the Aviary Terrace, the site of a bird house, which is decorated with four statues of shepherds and shepherdesses by John Nost. They were once painted in colours, but are now treated with a uniform grey weather-resistant paint. The third level is the Orangery Terrace, which houses an orangery. When built this was heated and was open to the elements, but in the early 20th century the arcade was enclosed with windows and a door case moved from the main entrance to the keep in the Outer Courtyard. A lead statue of a peacock on this terrace came originally from Claremont, Robert Clive&#x27;s country house in Surrey. The last remaining terrace is the Apple Bank. Helena Attlee, in her &quot;The Gardens of Wales&quot;, notes the varied planting styles, sub-tropical on the Top Terrace, Mediterranean on the Aviary Terrace, and British double-herbaceous borders on the Orangery Terrace.

===Later work===

William Emes, apart from the destruction of the water garden, did make improvements to the estate. A road that cut through the park just below the castle was diverted, and much planting was undertaken on the Wilderness Ridge, the line of hills opposite the castle, on the other side of the Great Lawn. The last major transformation of the gardens was undertaken in the early 20th century by Violet, wife of the fourth earl. Her ambition was &quot;to turn a poor and meagre garden into one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, in England and Wales&quot;.

Violet&#x27;s work included the relocation of the entire kitchen garden, including its glasshouses, to a new position behind the Wilderness ridge and the laying out of the formal garden at the base of the terraces, and a fountain garden and a croquet lawn in the far south-eastern corner. The kitchen garden had previously been concealed from the castle by a bank of elm trees, but these were brought down in a storm in 1912, exposing a view of the greenhouses which appalled the Countess. &quot;I am greeted every day by the repulsive sight of the detestable little [hot]houses which stare in their naked horror up at the beautiful terraces and the grand old castle towering above.&quot;

<doc id="769673" wikidata="Q1335625" url="?curid=769673" title="Robert B. Anderson (Texas politician)">
<text>Robert Bernard Anderson (June 4, 1910 August 14, 1989) was an American administrator, politician, and businessman. He served as the Secretary of the Navy between February 1953 and March 1954. He also served as the Secretary of the Treasury from 1957 until 1961, and was one of President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s closest confidants.

In 1987, two years before his death from throat cancer, he was disbarred for illegal banking operations and tax evasion. In the 1980s, Anderson illegally operated an Anguilla-based bank. The bank was involved in money laundering for drug traffickers. Anderson pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the banking laws, and was sentenced to prison.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Burleson, Texas on June 4, 1910, to Robert Lee Anderson and his wife Elizabeth Haskew &quot;Lizzy&quot; Anderson. He was a high school teacher prior to entering the University of Texas Law School, from which he graduated in 1932. He thereafter engaged in political, governmental, law and business activities in the state of Texas.

== State government service ==

Upon leaving the University of Texas School of Law in 1932, Anderson soon became an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Texas where he worked in 1933–1934. By 1934, he moved onward to become a State of Texas Tax Commissioner.

By 1939–1940, Anderson pursued opportunities within the private sector; he and two other partners purchased the City of Austin-based KTBC radio station from the Texas Broadcasting Company. In 1943, not able to increase KTBC&#x27;s broadcasting power from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the three partners sold KTBC to Lady Bird Johnson, wife of then-Representative and future President Lyndon B. Johnson.

== Marriage and children ==
Anderson married Ollie Mae Rawlins on April 10, 1935. The couple had two sons, Gerald Lee and James Richard. The Anderson family later moved to Cleburne, Texas. Ollie Anderson died in Greenwich, Connecticut of Alzheimer disease on May 31, 1987.

== Federal government service ==
According to the Seagraves, Anderson was with Douglas MacArthur and Edward Lansdale inspecting the Philippine caves containing Yamashita&#x27;s gold immediately after World War II ended.

During his time as Navy Secretary, he ended the last formal vestiges of racial segregation in the Navy and advocated the force levels and technological advances necessary to maintain a flexible defense strategy. In May 1954, Anderson left his Navy post to become Deputy Secretary of Defense. He received the Medal of Freedom in 1955. From 1957 to 1961, he served as Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury.

Eisenhower was particularly impressed by Anderson&#x27;s abilities, believing him to be more than capable of being president himself, and named him as one of his leading choices to be his running mate in 1956 if Vice-President Richard Nixon had accepted Eisenhower&#x27;s recommendation to leave the vice-presidency to serve as Secretary of Defense. However, Nixon opted to remain on the ticket with Ike. As 1960 approached, although Eisenhower acknowledged that Nixon certainly had the Republican presidential nomination sewn up, Eisenhower privately pressed Anderson to enter the primaries and to challenge Nixon, but Anderson declined. Once Nixon was nominated, Eisenhower suggested that he select Anderson as his running mate, but Nixon chose Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. instead. Eisenhower said Anderson &quot;is just about the ablest man that I know, He would make a splendid President.&quot;

In 1959, as Secretary of the Treasury, Anderson supported the creation of the International Development Association, after pressure from then-Senator Mike Monroney (D-Oklahoma). Anderson was close to Sid Richardson and Clint Murchison who was very close to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Many Texas oilmen including Murchison, formerly a close associate of Lyndon B. Johnson, ended their relationships with Johnson when Johnson became vice president on John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential ticket because Kennedy advocated tax reform on oil companies and their investments.

In 1963, President Kennedy appointed Anderson to a special committee to study the United States foreign aid program. In 1964 following Panamanian riots, President Johnson appointed him as special ambassador to Panama where he conducted negotiations for a new treaty on the status of the Panama Canal. At the same time, Anderson served as chairman of a Congressional study commission to determine if building a sea level canal through Panama was possible. He succeeded in negotiating a preliminary treaty to transfer the Canal to the control of Panama, but, before the treaty was ratified by the legislature of Panama, General Omar Torrijos overthrew the Panamanian government in October 1968 and rejected the proposed treaty. In June 1973, he resigned his ambassador post, unable to secure agreement on another preliminary treaty proposal and was replaced by Ellsworth Bunker who agreed to Panamanian demands to a rapid transition to control by Panama and the subsequent Bunker negotiated treaty was ratified in 1978 for transfer of the Panama Canal from United States jurisdiction to Panama jurisdiction and control.

During the 1960s, he carried out diplomatic missions on behalf of President Lyndon B. Johnson, including many trips to Cairo to confer with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the wake of the 1967 Six-Day War.

== Private business and death ==
After leaving office in 1961, Anderson moved to New York City and was active in business, investment, banking affairs, oil, and real estate. Anderson owned the Anderson group, headquartered at One Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, where he had business interests in a number of international projects.

He established the Robert Anderson &amp; Company Limited in Hong Kong on August 19, 1961, and operated it as a private company limited by shares until December 29, 1972, when it was dissolved.

He was unsuccessful in establishing a free port in Malta.

Anderson was a director on the Hong Kong Resort Company board. He had a casino investment with Edward Wong Wing-cheung, who founded HKR in May 1973.

He was a lobbyist for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Unification Church during the 1980s.

Anderson&#x27;s career ended in personal suffering. He was hospitalized several times for alcoholism. From 1983 to 1985, he and his partner David B. Gould illegally operated the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust of Anguilla, British West Indies, which had an unlicensed New York branch office. The bank lost $4.4 million and several investors lost their life savings in the mid-1980s, including record producer Ethel Gabriel. The bank also laundered large amounts of cash for drug traffickers. In 1987, Anderson, who was charged by Rudolph Giuliani as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the banking laws and to tax evasion, and was sentenced to prison. The Supreme Court of New York Appellate Division, in disbarring Anderson from the practice of law, called his disbarment &quot;a sad but we think necessary end to the legal career of one who has in times less beclouded by poor and corrupt judgment served his country in high office as Secretary of Treasury, Deputy Secretary of the Navy and as Special Ambassador to Panama during the Panama Canal negotiations.&quot;

Anderson died of throat cancer following his cancer surgery in New York City on August 14, 1989. He was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Cleburne, Texas.

The Robert B. Anderson Papers 1933–89 were deposited at the Eisenhower Library at Abilene, Kansas, between 1992 and 1996 with more in July 2001 and gifted to the Eisenhower Library on December 26, 2001, by Gerald Anderson, son of Robert Anderson.
