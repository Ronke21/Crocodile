<doc id="768225" wikidata="Q2415242" url="?curid=768225" title="Anti-Party Group">
<text>The Anti-Party Group, fully referenced in the Soviet political parlance as &quot;the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Shepilov, who joined them&quot; () was a Stalinist group within the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that unsuccessfully attempted to depose Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Party in June 1957. The group, given that epithet by Khrushchev, was led by former Premiers Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov and former First Deputy Premier Lazar Kaganovich. The group rejected both Khrushchev&#x27;s liberalization of Soviet society and his denunciation of Joseph Stalin, and promoted the full restoration and preservation of Stalinism.

==Motives==

The members of the group regarded Khrushchev&#x27;s attacks on Stalin, most famously in the Secret Speech delivered at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956 as wrong and hypocritical, given Khrushchev&#x27;s complicity in the Great Purge and similar events as one of Stalin&#x27;s favorites. They believed that Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of peaceful coexistence would jeopardize struggle against capitalist powers internationally.

==Attempted take-over==

On June 18, 1957, the leaders of the group – Malenkov, Molotov and Kaganovich – were joined at the last minute by Foreign Minister Dmitri Shepilov, whom Kaganovich had convinced that the group had a majority. Although they did not have a majority in the entire Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, they had a majority of the Presidium&#x27;s 11 full members, who were the only ones that could vote. In the Presidium the group&#x27;s proposal to replace Khrushchev as First Secretary with Premier Nikolai Bulganin won with 7 to 4 votes in which Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Pervukhin and Saburov supported and Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Suslov and Kirichenko opposed, but Khrushchev argued that only the plenum of the Central Committee could remove him from office. At an extraordinary session of the Central Committee held on June 22, Khrushchev argued that his opponents were an &quot;anti-party group&quot;. 

Khrushchev had the approval of the military, headed by Minister of Defense Georgy Zhukov. At that plenary session of Central Committee Zhukov supported Khrushchev, and used the military to bring in supporters of Khrushchev to convince people to support him. He made a bitter speech, accusing the group of having blood on their hands over Stalin&#x27;s atrocities. Zhukov emphasized that the Red Army supported Khrushchev: &quot;The Army is against this resolution and not even a tank will leave its position without my order!&quot; In the end of the power struggle, Khruschev was reaffirmed in his position as First Secretary.

==Aftermath==

Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich and Shepilov were vilified in the press and deposed from their positions in party and government by a June 29, 1957 decree of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU. They were given relatively unimportant positions:
*Molotov was sent as ambassador to Mongolia
*Malenkov became director of a hydroelectric plant in Kazakhstan
*Kaganovich became director of a small potash works in the Urals
*Shepilov became head of the Economics Institute of the local Academy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan

In 1958, Premier Bulganin, the intended beneficiary of the anti-party group&#x27;s move, was forced to retire and Khrushchev became Premier as well.

In 1961, in the wake of further de-Stalinisation, Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Shepilov were expelled from the Communist Party altogether and all lived mostly quiet lives from then on. Shepilov was allowed to rejoin the party by Khrushchev&#x27;s successor Leonid Brezhnev in 1976 but remained on the sidelines. 

Khrushchev also deposed Defense Minister Zhukov in 1961. Zhukov had assisted Khrushchev against the anti-party group, but the two developed significant political differences in the following years. Khrushchev alleged Bonapartism as a justification for Zhukov&#x27;s removal. 

As a result of the incident, Khrushchev&#x27;s position within the international communist bloc became insecure for a time, thus necessitating the support of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong. The CCP thus traded its support for Khrushchev for Soviet technology of nuclear weapons. The &quot;Agreement on New Technology for National Defence&quot; was signed in October of that year.

<doc id="768226" wikidata="Q1026956" url="?curid=768226" title="California Trail">
<text>The California Trail was an emigrant trail of about across the western half of the North American continent from Missouri River towns to what is now the state of California. After it was established, the first half of the California Trail followed the same corridor of networked river valley trails as the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trail, namely the valleys of the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers to Wyoming. The trail has several splits and cutoffs for alternative routes around major landforms and to different destinations, with a combined length of over .

== Introduction ==
By 1847, two former fur trading frontier forts marked trailheads for major alternative routes through Utah and Wyoming to Northern California. The first was Jim Bridger&#x27;s Fort Bridger (est. 1842) in present-day Wyoming on the Green River, where the Mormon Trail turned southwest over the Wasatch Range to the newly established Salt Lake City, Utah. From Salt Lake the Salt Lake Cutoff (est. 1848) went north and west of the Great Salt Lake and rejoined the California Trail in the City of Rocks in present-day Idaho.

The main Oregon and California Trails crossed the Yellow River on several different ferries and trails (cutoffs) that led to or bypassed Fort Bridger and then crossed over a range of hills to the Great Basin drainage of the Bear River (Great Salt Lake). Just past present-day Soda Springs, Idaho, both trails initially turned northwest, following the Portneuf River (Idaho) valley to the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Fort Hall (est. 1836) on the Snake River in present-day Idaho. From Fort Hall the Oregon and California trails went about southwest along the Snake River Valley to another &quot;parting of the ways&quot; trail junction at the junction of the Raft and Snake rivers. The California Trail from the junction followed the Raft River to the City of Rocks in Idaho near the present Nevada-Idaho-Utah tripoint. The Salt Lake and Fort Hall routes were about the same length: about .

From the City of Rocks the trail went into the present state of Utah following the South Fork of Junction Creek. From there the trail followed along a series of small streams, such as Thousand Springs Creek in the present state of Nevada until approaching present-day Wells, Nevada, where they met the Humboldt River. By following the crooked, meandering Humboldt River Valley west across the arid Great Basin, emigrants were able to get the water, grass, and wood they needed for themselves and their teams. The water turned increasingly alkaline as they progressed down the Humboldt, and there were almost no trees. &quot;Firewood&quot; usually consisted of broken brush, and the grass was sparse and dried out. Few travelers liked the Humboldt River Valley passage.

At the end of the Humboldt River, where it disappeared into the alkaline Humboldt Sink, travelers had to cross the deadly Forty Mile Desert before finding either the Truckee River or Carson River in the Carson Range and Sierra Nevada that were the last major obstacles before entering Northern California.

An alternative route across the present states of Utah and Nevada that bypassed both Fort Hall and the Humboldt River trails was developed in 1859. This route, the Central Overland Route, which was about shorter and more than 10 days quicker, went south of the Great Salt Lake and across the middle of present-day Utah and Nevada through a series of springs and small streams. The route went south from Salt Lake City across the Jordan River to Fairfield, Utah, then west-southwest past Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Callao, Utah, Ibapah, Utah, to Ely, Nevada, then across Nevada to Carson City, Nevada. (Today&#x27;s U.S. Route 50 in Nevada roughly follows this route.) (See: Pony Express Map) In addition to immigrants and migrants from the East, after 1859 the Pony Express, Overland stages and the First Transcontinental Telegraph (1861) all followed this route with minor deviations.

Once in Western Nevada and Eastern California, the pioneers worked out several paths over the rugged Carson Range and Sierra Nevada into the gold fields, settlements and cities of northern California. The main routes initially (1846–1848) were the Truckee Trail to the Sacramento Valley and after about 1849 the Carson Trail route to the American River and the Placerville, California gold digging region.

Starting about 1859, the Johnson Cutoff (Placerville Route, est. 1850–1851) and the Henness Pass Route (est. 1853) across the Sierra were greatly improved and developed. These main roads across the Sierra were both toll roads so there were funds to pay for maintenance and upkeep on the roads. These toll roads were also used to carry cargo west to east from California to Nevada, as thousands of tons of supplies were needed by the gold and silver miners, etc. working on the Comstock Lode (1859–1888) near the present Virginia City, Nevada. The Johnson Cutoff, from Placerville to Carson City along today&#x27;s U.S. Route 50 in California, was used by the Pony Express (1860–61) year-round and in the summer by the stage lines (1860–1869). It was the only overland route from the East to California that could be kept partially open for at least horse traffic in the winter.

The California Trail was heavily used from 1845 until several years after the end of the American Civil War; in 1869 several rugged wagon routes were established across the Carson Range and Sierra Nevada to different parts of northern California. After about 1848 the most popular route was the Carson Route which, while rugged, was still easier than most others and entered California in the middle of the gold fields. The trail was heavily used in the summers until the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869 by the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads. Trail traffic rapidly fell off as the cross-country trip was much quicker and easier by train—about seven days. The economy class fare across the western United States of about $69 was affordable by most California-bound travelers.

The trail was used by about 2,700 settlers from 1846 up to 1849. These settlers were instrumental in helping convert California to a U.S. possession. Volunteer members of John C. Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion assisted the Pacific Squadron&#x27;s sailors and marines in 1846 and 1847 in conquering California in the Mexican–American War. After the discovery of gold in January 1848, word spread about the California Gold Rush. Starting in late 1848 until 1869, more than 250,000 businessmen, farmers, pioneers and miners passed over the California Trail to California. The traffic was so heavy that in two years the new settlers added so many people to California that by 1850 it qualified for admission as the 31st state with 120,000 residents. The Trail travelers were added to those migrants going by wagon from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, California in winter, the travelers down the Gila River trail in Arizona, and those traveling by sea routes around Cape Horn and the Strait of Magellan, or by sea and then across the Isthmus of Panama, Nicaragua, or Mexico, and then by sea to California. Roughly half of California&#x27;s new settlers came by trail and the other half by sea.

The original route had many branches and cutoffs, encompassing about in total. About of the rutted traces of these trails remain in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and California as historical evidence of the great mass migration westward. Portions of the trail are now preserved by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the National Park Service (NPS) as the California National Historic Trail and marked by BLM, NPS and the many state organizations of the Oregon-California Trails Association (OCTA). Maps put out by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) show the network of rivers followed to get to California.

== Establishment (1811–1840) ==
The beginnings of the California and Oregon Trails were laid out by mountain men and fur traders from about 1811 to 1840 and were only passable initially on foot or by horseback. South Pass, the easiest pass over the U.S. continental divide of the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean drainages, was discovered by Robert Stuart and his party of seven in 1812 while he was taking a message from the west to the east back to John Jacob Astor about the need for a new ship to supply Fort Astoria on the Columbia River—their supply ship &quot;Tonquin&quot; had blown up. In 1824, fur trappers Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick rediscovered the South Pass as well as the Sweetwater, North Platte and Platte River Valleys connecting to the Missouri River.

British fur traders primarily used the Columbia and Snake rivers to take their supplies to their trading posts. After 1824, U.S. fur traders had discovered and developed first pack and then wagon trails along the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater and Big Sandy River (Wyoming) to the Green River (Colorado River) where they often held their annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous (1827–1840) held by a fur trading company at which U.S. trappers, mountain men and Indians sold and traded their furs and hides and replenished their supplies they had used up in the previous year.

A rendezvous typically only lasted a few weeks and was known to be a lively, joyous place, where nearly all were allowed—free trappers, Native Americans, native trapper wives and children, travelers, and later on, even tourists who would venture from even as far as Europe to observe the games and festivities. Trapper Jim Beckwourth describes: &quot;Mirth, songs, dancing, shouting, trading, running, jumping, singing, racing, target-shooting, yarns, frolic, with all sorts of drinking and gambling extravagances that white men or Indians could invent.&quot; Initially from about 1825 to 1834 the fur traders used pack trains to carry their supplies in and the traded furs out.

===Beginnings===
Sections of what became the California Trail route were discovered and developed by American fur traders including Kit Carson, Joseph R. Walker, and Jedediah Smith, who often worked with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and after 1834 by the American Fur Company and explored widely in the west. Canadian Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden and others scouted the Humboldt River off and on from about 1830 to 1840—little of their explorations was known. A few U.S. and British fur trappers and traders had explored what is now called the Humboldt River (named Mary&#x27;s River by Ogden) that crosses most of the present state of Nevada and provides a natural corridor to western Nevada and eastern California.

The Humboldt River was of little interest to the trappers as it was hard to get to, dead ended in an alkali sink, and had few beavers. The details of the Humboldt River and how to get to it was known to only a few trappers. When trapping largely ceased in the 1840s due to a change in men&#x27;s hat style that didn&#x27;t use the felt from beaver&#x27;s fur there was a number of out of work fur trappers and traders who were familiar with many of the Indians, trails, and rivers in the west.

In 1832, Captain Benjamin Bonneville, a United States Military Academy graduate on temporary leave, followed the fur traders paths along the valleys of the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater Rivers to South Pass (Wyoming) with a fur trader&#x27;s caravan of 110 men and 20 wagons over and on to the Green River—the first wagons over South Pass.

In the spring of 1833, Captain Benjamin Bonneville sent a party of men under former fur trapper and &quot;now&quot; explorer Joseph R. Walker to explore the Great Salt Lake desert and Big Basin and attempt to find an overland route to California. Eventually the party re-discovered the Humboldt River crossing much of present-day Nevada. After crossing the hot and dry Forty Mile Desert they passed through the Carson River Canyon across the Carson Range and ascended the Sierra Nevada. They descended from the Sierra via the Stanislaus River drainage to the Central Valley of California and proceeded on west as far as Monterey, California—the Californio capital. His return route from California went across the southern Sierra mountains via what&#x27;s named now Walker Pass—named by U.S. Army topographic engineer, explorer, adventurer, and map maker John C. Frémont.

The Humboldt River Valley was key to forming a usable California Trail. The Humboldt River with its water and grass needed by the livestock (oxen, mules horses and later cattle) and emigrants provided a key link west to northern California. One of several &quot;parting of the ways&quot; that split the Oregon and California Trails was eventually established at the Snake River and Raft River junctions in what is now Idaho. The Raft River, Junction Creek in the future states of Idaho and Utah and Thousand Springs Creek in the future states of Nevada and Utah provided the usable trail link between the Snake and Humboldt Rivers.

After about 1832, a rough wagon trail had been blazed to the Green River—the chief tributary of the Colorado River. After 1832, the fur traders often brought wagon loads of supplies to trade with the white and Native American fur trappers at their annual rendezvous usually somewhere on the Green River. They returned to the Missouri River towns by following their rough trail in reverse. The future Oregon/California wagon trail had minimal improvements, usually limited to partially filling in impassable gullys, etc. By 1836, when the first Oregon migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been scouted and roughed out to Fort Hall, Idaho. In July 1836, missionary wives Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Spalding were the first white pioneer women to cross South Pass on their way to Oregon Territory via Fort Hall. They left their wagons at Fort Hall and went the rest of the way by pack train and boats down the Columbia River as recommended by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trappers at Fort Hall.

As early as 1837, John Marsh, who was the first American doctor in California and the owner of the large Rancho Los Meganos, realized that owning a great rancho was problematic if he could not hold it. The corrupt and unpredictable rulings by courts in California (then part of Mexico) made this questionable. With evidence that the Russians, French and English were preparing to seize the province, he determined to make it a part of the United States. He felt that the best way to go about this was to encourage emigration by Americans to California, and in this way the history of Texas would be repeated.
Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, soil and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow (the California Trail), which became known as &quot;Marsh&#x27;s route.&quot; His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first significant immigration to California. The trail ended at his ranch, and he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.

After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh helped take California from the last Mexican governor, thereby paving the way to California&#x27;s ultimate acquisition by the United States.

===Bartleson–Bidwell Party===

The first recorded party to use part of the California Trail to get to California was the Bartleson–Bidwell Party in 1841. They left Missouri with 69 people and reasonably easily reached the future site of Soda Springs, Idaho on the Bear River by following experienced trapper Thomas &quot;Broken-hand&quot; Fitzpatrick on his way to Fort Hall. Near Soda Springs the Bear River swung southwest towards the Great Salt Lake and the regular Oregon Trail headed northwest out of the Big Basin drainage and into the Portneuf River (Idaho) drainage to Fort Hall on the Snake River.

About half of the party elected to attempt to continue by wagon to California and half elected to go to Oregon on the more established Oregon Trail. The California-bound travelers (including one woman and one child), knew only that California was west of them and there was reportedly a river across most of the &#x27;Big Basin&#x27; that led part of the way to California. Without guides or maps, they traveled down the Bear River as it looped southwest through Cache Valley, Utah. When they found the Bear River terminating in the Great Salt Lake, they traveled west across the Big Basin through the rough and sparse semi-desert north of the Great Salt Lake.

After crossing most of what would become the state of Utah and passing into the future state of Nevada, they missed the head of the Humboldt River and abandoned their wagons in Nevada at Big Spring at the foot of the Pequop Mountains. They continued west using their oxen and mules as pack animals eventually finding the Humboldt River and followed it west to its termination in an alkali sink near present-day Lovelock, Nevada.

After crossing the difficult Forty Mile Desert they turned to the south on the east side of the Sierra until they reached the Walker River draining east out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. They followed the Walker westward as they ascended over the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains roughly in the same region crossed by Jedediah Smith in 1828. They were able to finish their rugged trip over the Sierra and into the future state of California by killing and eating many of their oxen for food. Everyone survived the journey.

===Joseph Chiles===
Joseph B. Chiles, a member of the Bartleson–Bidwell Party, returned east in 1842 and organized the first of his seven California-bound immigrant companies in 1843. Following the Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger, the Chiles company enlisted mountain man Joseph R. Walker as a guide. Chiles and Walker split the company into two groups. Walker led the company with the wagons west toward California by following the Oregon Trail to Fort Hall, Idaho, and turning west off the Oregon trail at the Snake River, Raft River junction. At the head of the Raft River they crossed a divide into the Big Basin drainage and followed a series of streams like Thousand Springs Creek in what is now Nevada to the Humboldt River valley near today&#x27;s Wells, Nevada.

They blazed a wagon trail down the Humboldt River Valley and across Forty Mile Desert until they hit the Carson River. Here instead of immediately attempting to cross the Sierra by following the Carson River as it came out of the mountains they turned south, traveling east of the Sierra along what is now roughly the Nevada and California border—about where U.S. Route 395 in California is today.

With scarce provisions, winter approaching and failing draft animals, by the end of 1843 they had traveled south almost on the east side of the Sierra before they abandoned their wagons near Owens Lake in eastern central California and proceeded by pack train to make a December crossing of the Sierra Nevada mountains over Walker Pass on California State Route 178) in the southeast Sierra, an arduous route used by almost no one else.

Trying to find a different route, Chiles led the rest of the settlers in a pack train party down the Oregon Trail to where it intersected the Malheur River in eastern Oregon which he then followed across Oregon to California.

===John Fremont===
Another mixed party on horseback of U.S. Army topographers, hunters, scouts, etc. of about 50 men in 1843–1844 led by U.S. Army Colonel John C. Frémont of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and his chief scout Kit Carson took their exploration company down the Humboldt River, crossing Forty Mile Desert and then following what is now called the Carson River across the Carson Range that is east of what is now called Lake Tahoe—previously seen but not explored by Fremont from a peak near what is now called Carson Pass.

They made a winter crossing of the Carson Range and Sierra Nevada in February 1843. From Carson pass they followed the northern Sierra&#x27;s southern slopes, to minimize snow depth, of what is now called the American River Valley down to Sutter&#x27;s Fort located near what is now Sacramento, California. Fremont took the data gathered by his topographers and map makers in his 1843–1844 and 1846–1847 explorations of much of the American west to create and publish (by order of Congress) the first &quot;decent&quot; map of California and Oregon in 1848.

===First wagons to cross===
The first group to cross the Sierra with their wagons was the Stephens–Townsend–Murphy Party of 1844. They departed from the Oregon Trail along the Snake River by following the Raft River to the City of Rocks in Idaho and then passed over the Big Basin continental divide and used a series of springs and small streams in what is now Nevada to get to the Humboldt River near where the town of Wells, Nevada is now.

They followed the Humboldt River across Nevada and the future Truckee Trail Route across the rugged Forty Mile Desert and along the Truckee River to the foot of the Sierra. They got over the Sierra at Donner Pass by unloading the wagons and packing the contents to the top using their ox teams as pack animals. The wagons were then partially dis-assembled and then pulled by multiple teams of oxen up the steep slopes and cliffs. Some wagons were left at Donner Lake. Once on top, the remaining wagons were reassembled and reloaded for their trip to Sutter&#x27;s Fort (Sacramento, California).

They were caught by early winter snows and abandoned their wagons near Emigrant Gap and had to hike out of the Sierra after being rescued by a party from Sutter&#x27;s Fort on February 24, 1845. Their abandoned wagons were retrieved in the spring of 1845 and pulled the rest of the way to Sutter&#x27;s Fort. A usable but very rough wagon route had finally been worked out along the Humboldt River and the rugged, hot and dry Forty Mile Desert across Nevada and over the rugged and steep Sierra Nevada by California-bound settlers. In the following years, several other rugged routes over the Sierra were developed.

===Hastings Cutoff===
Pioneered by Lansford Hastings in 1846, the Hastings Cutoff left the California Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming. In 1846 the party, guided by Hastings, passed successfully through the rugged, narrow, rock-filled Weber Canyon to get over the Wasatch Range. In a few places the wagons had to be floated down the river in some narrow spots and the wagons had to be pried over large rocks in many places.

Passing the future site of Ogden, Utah and Salt Lake City, Utah Hastings party proceeded south of the Great Salt Lake and then across about of waterless Bonneville Salt Flats and around the Ruby Mountains in Nevada before getting to the Humboldt River Valley California trail. The severely water-challenged Hastings Cutoff trail across the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s salt flats rejoined the California Trail about west of modern-day Elko, Nevada. The party led by Hastings were just two weeks ahead of the Donner Party but did successfully get to California before snow closed the passes and stranded the Donner Party in the Sierra.

As recommended by a message from Hastings after he got through Weber canyon, another branch of the Hastings trail was cut across the Wasatch Range by the Donner Party. Their rough trail required clearing a very rough wagon trail through thick brush down Emigration Canyon to get into the Salt Lake Valley. To avoid cutting too much brush in some places they used multiple ox teams to pull wagons up steep slopes to get around brush loaded canyon sections. Cutting this rough trail slowed the Donner Party down by about two weeks—Hastings successfully navigated the rugged Weber Canyon in about four days.

The Mormon Trail over the Wasatch Mountains followed roughly the same path as the Donner Party trail of 1846 but they built a much better trail with many more workers in 1847 to get to the Salt Lake valley with much less hassle—this was their main route to and from their Salt Lake communities. The Weber Canyon trail was judged too rugged for regular use without a lot of work—later done by Mormon workers on the first transcontinental railroad in 1868–1869.

All of the Hastings Cutoffs to California were found to be very hard on the wagons, livestock and travelers as well as being longer, harder, and slower to traverse than the regular trail and was largely abandoned after 1846. It was discovered by some hurrying travelers in 1849 (before the experience of the 1846 travelers was widely known) that during a wet year, wagons could not be pulled across the Great Salt Lake Desert; it was too soft.

===Salt Lake Cutoff===
In 1848, the Salt Lake Cutoff was discovered by returning Mormon Battalion soldiers and others from the City of Rocks (in the future state of Idaho) to the northwest of the Great Salt Lake and on to Salt Lake City. This cutoff allowed travelers to use the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger over the Wasatch Range to Salt Lake City and back to the California Trail. In Salt Lake they could get repairs and fresh supplies and livestock by trade or cash.

The Mormons were trying to establish new Mormon communities in Utah and needed almost everything then. The trail from Fort Bridger to Salt Lake City and over the Salt Lake Cutoff was about before it rejoined the California Trail near the City of Rocks in Idaho. This cutoff had adequate water and grass, and many thousands of travelers used this cutoff for years. The &quot;regular&quot; California Trail from Fort Bridger via Fort Hall on the Snake River and on to the City of Rocks was within a few miles of being the same distance as going to Salt Lake City and on to the City of Rocks via the Salt Lake Cutoff.

===Central Overland Route===
In April 1859, an expedition of U.S. Corp of Topographical Engineers led by U.S. Army Captain James H. Simpson left U.S. Army&#x27;s Camp Floyd (Utah) (now Fairfield, Utah) in central Utah to establish an army western supply route across the Great Basin to California. Upon his return in early August 1859, Simpson reported that he had surveyed what became the Central Overland Route from Camp Floyd to Genoa, Nevada. This route went through central Nevada roughly where U.S. Route 50 goes today from Carson City, Nevada, to Ely, Nevada. From Ely the route is approximated today by the roads to Ibapah, Utah, Callao, Utah, Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Fairfield, Utah to Salt Lake City, Utah (See: Pony Express Map and Pony Express auto route)

The Central Overland Route was about shorter than the &#x27;standard&#x27; California Trail Humboldt River route. This Central Overland Route, with minor modifications was used by settler&#x27;s wagon trains, the Pony Express, stagecoach lines and the First Transcontinental Telegraph after 1859.

====Literary descriptions====
Several accounts of travel along the Central Overland Route have been published. In July 1859, Horace Greeley made the trip, at a time when Chorpenning was using only the eastern segment (they reconnected with the main California Trail near present-day Beowawe, Nevada). Greeley published his detailed observations in his 1860 book &quot;An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco&quot;.

In October 1860, the English explorer Richard Burton traveled the entire route at a time when the Pony Express was operating. He gave detailed descriptions of each of the way stations in his 1861 book &quot;The City of the Saints, Across the Rocky Mountains to California&quot;.

Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) traveled the route in the summer of 1861 with his brother Orion on their way to Nevada&#x27;s new territorial capital in Carson City, Nevada, but provided only sparse descriptions of the road in his 1872 book &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

== Early history and maps of the California Trail (1826–1850) ==

The Great Basin and the Sierra Nevada through which the trail passed were first explored by British and American fur trappers. U.S. trapper, explorer and fur trader Jedediah Smith led two expeditions into California and over the Sierra Nevada and back from 1826 to 1829. It is believed that on his first trip he used the Mojave River route (later part of the Old Spanish Trail) to get into California and Ebbetts Pass when leaving California in the spring 1827. On Smith&#x27;s second trip he entered California the same way and left through Oregon. Smith was killed in 1831 before he could publish his explorations, which were only known by word of mouth.

In 1828–1829, Peter Skene Ogden, leading expeditions for the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, explored much of the Humboldt River area—named by him the Mary&#x27;s River. The results of these explorations were held as proprietary secrets for many decades by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In 1834 Benjamin Bonneville, a United States Army officer on leave to pursue an expedition to the west financed by John Jacob Astor, sent Joseph R. Walker and a small horse mounted party westward from the Green River in present-day Wyoming. They were charged with the mission of finding a route to California. Walker confirmed that the Humboldt River furnished a natural artery across the Great Basin to the Sierra Nevada. He eventually got across the Sierra Nevada in southern California over Walker Pass. Bonneville had the account of his and Walker&#x27;s explorations in the west written up by Washington Irving in 1838. (See &quot;The Adventures of Captain Bonneville&quot;).

A few hundred mountain men and their families had been filtering into California for several decades prior to 1841 over various paths from Oregon and Santa Fe. The first known emigrants to use parts of the California Trail was the 1841 Bartleson–Bidwell Party. They followed the Humboldt River across Nevada and eventually made it into northern California. Other parts of this party split off and were one of the first sets of emigrants to use the Oregon Trail to get to Oregon. The California-bound travelers, striking out from the Snake River and passing into Nevada, missed the head of the Humboldt River there. They abandoned their wagons in eastern Nevada and finished the trip by pack train. After an arduous transit of the Sierra (its believed over Ebbetts Pass), members of this group later founded Chico, California in the Sacramento Valley. In 1842 (a year without any known California Trail emigration), Joseph Chiles, a member of the Bartleson–Bidwell Party of 1841, returned with several others back east. In 1843, Chiles led a party (of seven he eventually would lead) back to California. At Fort Hall he met Joseph Reddeford Walker who he convinced to lead half the settlers with him traveling in wagons back to California down the Humboldt. Chiles led the rest in a pack train party down the Malheur River to California. Walker&#x27;s party in 1843 also abandoned their wagons and finished getting to California by pack train.

In 1844, Caleb Greenwood and the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party became the first settlers to take wagons over the Sierra Nevada and into California over what became the Truckee Trail. They abandoned their wagons in the early snow in the winter of 1844/1845 and finished retrieving their wagons from the mountains in the spring of 1845. In 1845, John C. Frémont and Lansford Hastings guided parties totaling several hundred settlers along the Humboldt River portion of the California Trail to California. They were the first to make the entire trip by wagon in one traveling season. In 1846 it is believed that about 1,500 settlers made their way to California over the Truckee branch of the California Trail—just in time to join the war for independence there. Many of the 1845 and 1846 emigrants were recruited into the California Battalion to assist the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron with its sailors and marines in the fight for California&#x27;s independence from Mexico.

The last immigrant party in 1846 was the Donner Party, who were persuaded by Lansford Hastings, who had only traveled over the route he recommended by pack train, to take what would be called the Hastings Cutoff around the south end of the Great Salt Lake. At the urging of Hastings, the Donner&#x27;s were induced to make a new &#x27;cutoff&#x27; over the rugged Wasatch Range where there were no wagon trails. Hastings recommended this despite the fact that he had successfully led about 80 wagons in the Harlan-Young party who blazed a new trail down the rugged Weber River to the Utah valley—he thought the Weber River route was too rugged for general travel. The Donner party spent over a week&#x27;s hard work scratching a barely usable path across the Wasatch mountains, getting ever further behind Hastings&#x27;s Party. When the Mormons tried using the Donner blazed trail in 1847 they were forced to abandon most of it and cut (with many more settlers available to clear trees and brush) a new and much easier to use trail (part of the Mormon Trail) to the Salt Lake Valley—taking 10 days of hard work to get through the Wasatch mountains.

The Hastings Cutoff went across about waterless salt flats south of the Great Salt Lake. While crossing the Salt Flats the Donner party, even though following the tracks of the Harlan-Young party, lost several wagons and many animals. After crossing, they spent almost a week at Donner Springs near the base of Pilot Peak (Nevada) in Box Elder County, Utah trying to recover themselves and their animals. They had to use even more time skirting around the Ruby Mountains in Nevada before hitting the Humboldt River and the regular trail. Altogether, crossing the Wasatch mountains and salt flats and skirting the Rubys cost them about three weeks more time over what staying on the main trail would have taken. They and their surviving wagons and teams were in poor shape. To add insult to injury the Donner-Reed party encountered others that had left Ft. Bridger after them, stayed on the main trail to Ft. Hall, and were now ahead of them. They were the last emigrants of 1846 to arrive in California—east of the Sierra and just as it started to snow. They were stranded by early snowfall in the eastern Sierra near what is now called Donner Lake and suffered severely including starvation, death and cannibalism (See: Donner Party).

The first &quot;decent&quot; map of California and Oregon were drawn by Captain John C. Frémont of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Corps of Topographical Engineers, and his topographers and cartographers in about 1848. Fremont and his men, led by his guide and former trapper Kit Carson, made extensive expeditions starting in 1844 over parts of California and Oregon including the important Humboldt River and Old Spanish Trail routes. They made numerous topographical measurements of longitude, latitude and elevation as well as cartographic sketches of the observable surroundings. His map, although in error in minor ways, was the best map available in 1848. John C. Frémont gave the Great Salt Lake, Humboldt River, Pyramid Lake, Carson River, Walker River, Old Spanish Trail etc. their current names. The Truckee River (called the Salmon-Trout River by Fremont) in California and Nevada was mapped. Lake Tahoe is shown but left unnamed. The major rivers in California are shown, presumably given the names used by the trappers and Mexican and foreign settlers there. The Humboldt was named (after the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt). Fremont and his topographers/cartographers did not have time (it would take literally decades of work to do this) to make extensive explorations of the entire Sierra Nevada range or Great Basin. Details of the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin concerning the best passes or possible emigrant routes for wagons would be explored and discovered from about 1846 to 1859 by numerous other explorers.

Fremont, together with his wife Jessie Benton Fremont, wrote an extensive account of his explorations and published the first &quot;accurate&quot; map of California and Oregon making them much more widely known. The U.S. Senate had 10,000 copies of Fremont&#x27;s map and exploration write-up printed. How many of these maps were actually in the hands of early immigrants is unknown.

The trickle of emigrants before 1848 became a flood after the discovery of gold in California in January 1848, the same year that the U.S. acquired and paid for possession of the New Mexico Territory and California Territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which terminated the Mexican–American War. The gold rush to northern California started in 1848 as settlers in Oregon, southern California, South America and Mexico headed for the gold fields even before the gold discovery was widely known about in the east. The public announcement of the gold discovery by President Polk in late 1848 and the display of an impressive amount of gold in Washington induced thousands of gold seekers in the east to begin making plans to go to California.

By the spring of 1849 tens of thousands of gold seekers headed westward for California. The California Trail was one of three main ways used as Argonauts went by the California Trail, across the disease ridden Isthmus of Panama and around the storm tossed Cape Horn between South America and Antarctica to get to California. The 1848 and 1849 gold rushers were just the first of many more as many more sought to seek their fortunes during the California Gold Rush, which continued for several years as miners found about $50,000,000 worth of gold (at $21/troy oz) each year.

1849 was also the first year of large scale cholera epidemics in the United States and the rest of the world, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California—most buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska. The 1850 census showed this rush was overwhelmingly male as the ratio of women to men in California over 16 was about 5:95

Combined with the settlers that came by sea, the California settlers that came over the California Trail by 1850 were sufficient (at about 93,000) for California to choose its state boundary, write a Constitution, and apply for and receive statehood, which it did as a free state.

The busy times on the trail were from late April to early October with almost no winter traffic (several parts of the trail were impassable in winter). In busy years the trail was more like a large immigrating village hundreds of miles long, as thousands used the same parts of the trail in the same short traveling season. Many signed up to wagon trains that traveled the whole route together. Many large trains broke up into several smaller trains to take better advantage of available camping spots, traveling schedules, conditions of teams, etc.. Others, usually traveling as family groups of various sizes, joined and left various trains as their own schedule, inclinations, altercations and traveling conditions dictated. Because of the numerous scrabbles often present in a given wagon train, a typical train may have several different leaders elected at various times to lead the train. Possible Indian troubles was about the only condition that kept large trains together for mutual protection. The 1849 travelers went in a wet year and found good grass almost the entire way and that most had taken too many supplies. The 1850 migration was in a dry year and with roughly double the number of travelers on the trail it suffered seriously from lack of grass and good water. To make things worse many had cut down on the amount of supplies they carried and began running out of food as they traveled down the Humboldt. Emergency relief expeditions led by the U.S. Army and others from California managed to save most of these late 1850 travelers.

==Preparation: trail supplies and equipment==
Books, pamphlets and guides were available for trail information after about 1846. After 1848, information about the trip to California and Oregon and what was needed for the trip was often available in the local newspapers, as, after 1849, mail and news (heavily subsidized) got back to the U.S. (via Panama) in about 40 days. By 1848 the newspapers of the day often published articles about California. After deciding to go, the first thing many did was to sell their farm or business, and start putting together an outfit. The 1850 U.S. Census of California showed that more than 95% of the people going to California in 1849 were male.

The first decision to make was what route to take to California, the California Trail or the various sea routes. Initially, about half of the Argonauts going to California went by sea, and half overland by trail. Most of those going by sea, which was quicker but more costly, lived on or near the East Coast of the United States and were familiar with ships and shipping. On the other hand, most of those going overland already lived in the mid-west or near the Ohio, Mississippi or Missouri Rivers. Nearly all reached their jumping off place by using a steamboat to get there with their animals and supplies. Of the Argonauts who returned from California, about 20% of them usually returned by sea across the Isthmus of Panama, particularly after 1855 when the paddle steamer shipping lines and the Panama Railroad across Panama cut the return trip to about 40 days versus about 140 days by wagon.

About 50–70% of the Argonauts who went by the California Trail were farmers, and many already had many of the supplies, wagons, animals etc. needed. A pioneer&#x27;s typical outfit, for three to six people, usually consisted of one or two small, sturdy farm wagons outfitted with bows and a canvas cover (new cost about $75 to $175 each), six to ten head of oxen ($75 to $300) and chains and yokes or harnesses to attach them to the wagons. For traveling about over rough terrain the wagons used were typically as small and as light as would do the job, approximately half the size of the larger Conestoga wagons used for freight. The typical California Trail wagon weighed about empty with about of capacity (starting with less than recommended) and about of storage space in an -long, -wide, by -high box. These wagons could be easily pulled by 4 to 6 oxen or 4 to 6 mules or horses. More animals than initially needed were usually recommended since some could (and usually did) stray off, die or be stolen during the trip. In addition to providing transport, shelter and protection against bad weather during the trip at the end of the trip many wagons were parked and became a temporary home until a more permanent cabin or shelter could be built. The average number of occupants of a typical wagon was about three pioneers per wagon (Mormon &quot;church teams&quot; often had eight-plus pioneers).

Accompanying nearly all wagon trains was a herd of horses, cows, oxen or mules. In many years it is estimated that there were more animals than people using the trail. A thriving trade consisted of herds of cows and sheep bought in the mid-west, herded over the trail and sold in California, Oregon etc.. The usually much cheaper animals in the mid-west could be herded to California etc. and sold for usually a substantial profit. Large herds were typically separated from the regular wagon trains because of their different speeds and herding requirements. These animals were usually the daytime responsibility of one or more herder(s) and the nighttime responsibility of the three or more wagon train guards. Each adult male, on a rotating schedule, was usually required to spend part of a night on guard duty.

The typical wagon with diameter wheels could easily move over rough ground and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon&#x27;s wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled shovel, wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased with a mixture of tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.

When mules or horses were chosen to pull the wagons, they typically cost about twice as much money and required more expensive harnesses. Oxen (used by 60–70%) were found to be cheaper, tougher, stronger, easier to catch, more easily trained, less prone to be stolen and better able to survive on the often sparse feed found along the way. Their only drawback was they were initially about 10% slower (2–3 miles/hour), but they often passed the mule and horse pulled teams as the trip wore on and the other teams wore out. Since the most popular draft animal was ox teams (≈70%), most walked nearly all the way to their destination. Some of the luckier ones had riding horses or mules and could afford to have someone else drive the wagon team. Mules were the second choice (used by 20–30%) but trained animals were hard to find, and it took up to two months to train them. Mules did better than horses on the often poor feed found along the way. Horses were often found to be incapable of the months of daily work and poor feed encountered without using supplemental grain (initially unavailable or too heavy), and thousands were recorded as dying near the end of the trip in the Forty Mile Desert. Horses and mules had the added disadvantage that they nearly always required herding and guarding day and night to prevent them from wandering off, stampeding, or being stolen. They were also harder to find and re-capture if they got lost. Often late in the trip mixed teams that included dairy cows and riding ponies were sometimes hitched up to make a usable team. Trading posts along the way did a thriving business in buying worn down teams at low prices and selling fresh animals. After a few weeks care and good feeding, these same teams could often be resold at a substantial profit.

One or more horses or mules were often included per wagon for riding, hunting, scouting and keeping herd on the animals. Saddles, bridles, hobbles, ropes, harnesses etc. were needed if they had a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra harness parts, rope, steel chain and wagon parts were often carried. Steel shoes for oxen, mules or horses and some spare parts for the wagons were carried by most. Tar was often carried to help repair an injured ox&#x27;s hoof. If the team was properly taken care of, they usually survived the trip in good shape, but if they were pushed too hard for too long they died or became too weak to continue. Many of the &quot;49ers&quot; were in a great rush and often pushed their animals too hard and they had to buy new animals along the way.

Food for the trip had to be compact, lightweight, and nonperishable. The more knowledgeable also brought dried fruit and vegetables to provide some variety (and Vitamin C) and were a known (to many) scurvy prevention. The method of preparing desiccated vegetables was to squeeze them in a press to remove most of their juice and then bake them for several hours in a low temperature oven. The vegetables like dried peas kept well if kept dry and a piece of dried vegetables the size of a fist when put in water and cooked could feed four. The recommended food to take per adult for the four- to six-month trip was of flour, of corn meal, of bacon, of sugar, of coffee, of dried fruit, of salt, half a pound (0.25 kg) of saleratus (baking soda), of tea, of rice, and of beans. Condiments like mustard, cinnamon, nutmeg, vinegar, pepper and other spices were usually included. Ex-trappers, ex-army soldiers and Indians often used pemmican made by pounding jerky until it was a coarse meal, putting it into a leather bag and then pouring rendered fat (and sometimes pulverized dried berries) over it—this was very light weight, could keep for months and provided a lot of energy. Some families took along milk cows and goats for milk and chickens (penned in crates tied to the wagons) for eggs and chicken dinners. Additional food like pickles, canned butter, cheese or pickled eggs were occasionally carried, but canned goods were expensive and relatively heavy to carry and food preservation was primitive, so few perishable items could be safely kept for the four to six-month duration of the trip. These provisions were usually kept in water-tight containers and carried inside the covered wagon to minimize getting wet. At river crossings their food usually had to be removed and carried across on a boat or raft to keep it dry—one of the reasons toll bridges or ferries were popular. Meat filled barrels () were often bought and then, to reduce weight, the bacon and ham were usually transferred to bran filled sacks and stuck in the bottom of the wagons to stay as cool as possible—the barrel being discarded. In hot weather bacon and ham was often hauled in large barrels packed in bran so the hot sun would not melt the fat. Medicinal supplies carried usually consisted of salves and ointments, laudanum (about the only effective pain medicine then and much over used), and a few home remedies.

The typical cost of enough food for four people for six months was about $150. The cost of other supplies, livestock, wagons etc. per person could easily double this cost. In the 1840s, $150.00 represented about 150 days worth of work or half a year&#x27;s typical salary so most of the poor were excluded from travel unless they got a job herding and guarding the livestock or driving a wagon.

The amount of food required was lessened if beef cattle, calves or sheep were taken along for a walking food supply. Prior to the 1870s, vast herds of buffalo in Nebraska provided fresh meat and jerky for the trip. In general, wild game and fish could not be depended on, but when found, were a welcome change in a monotonous diet. Travelers could hunt antelope, buffalo, trout, deer and occasionally sage hens, elk, bear, duck, geese, and salmon along the trail. Many travelers went via Salt Lake City, Utah and the Salt Lake Cutoff to get repairs, fresh or additional supplies, fresh vegetables and fresh livestock.

Cooking along the trail was typically done over a campfire dug into the ground and made of wood, dried buffalo chips, willow or sagebrush—whatever was easily available. After a rain the &#x27;Buffalo chips&#x27; were often hard to start on fire. Flint and steel or matches were used to start fires. Cooking equipment was typically light and included only simple cooking utensils such as butcher knives, forks, metal plates and cups, spoons, large spoons, spatulas, ladles, Dutch ovens, pots and pans, grills, spits, coffee pots, pot hooks and an iron tripod to suspend the pans and pots over the fire. Some brought small stoves, but these were often jettisoned along the way as too heavy and unnecessary. The usual meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner eaten by the mostly male Argonauts was bacon/ham, beans, coffee and biscuits/bread/corn bread or flapjacks.

If three or more were traveling together a tent was often included; but most slept on the ground—getting in the wagon only in case of bad weather. Wooden or canvas buckets were brought for carrying water, and most travelers carried canteens or water bags for daily use. One of the first tasks, after unhooking the animals and letting them water and graze, at almost every stop was getting a new supply of water for drinking, cooking and washing. The next task was usually rounding up enough fuel to start a fire for cooking and heating up the coffee. At least one ten gallon water barrel was brought, but it was usually kept nearly empty to minimize weight (some water in it helped prevent it from leaking); it was typically only filled for waterless stretches. Most casks were discarded near the end of trip as too heavy and no longer needed after Forty Mile Desert. Some brought a new invention—an India Rubber combination mattress and water carrier.

Each man typically took a rifle or shotgun and occasional pistol along with the necessary balls, gunpowder and primers for hunting game and protection against snakes and Indians. Many took their fishing gear along—at least lines and hooks as a usable pole could usually be cut from a willow or other bush. Belt knives or folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys and considered essential. Farm tools such as a plow, pick, shovel, scythe, rake, hoe; plus carpentry tools—saw, hammer, nails, broad axe, mallet, plane were often carried along. Farmers typically took seeds for corn, wheat and other crops. Some even included fruit trees and vines in their loads. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, thread and leather laces to repair clothes, shoes, harnesses, equipment and occasionally people were constantly in use. Spare leather used for repairs was often needed and used. Goggles to keep dust out of eyes were used by some. Storage boxes for food and supplies were often the same height so they could be arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for sleeping during bad weather. If the cargo weighed too much, and it often did initially, these boxes were typically discarded and nearly everything put into bags.

Nearly all brought at least two changes of clothes with extra shirts and jackets (wool usually recommended for its toughness and warmth) hats and multiple pairs of boots—two to three pairs often wore out on a trip. Moccasins at $0.50 to $1.00 per pair and buffalo robes at $4.00 to $8.00 each were often bought (or traded for equivalent valued items) from Indians encountered on the way. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, buffalo robes, pillows, canvas or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping (usually on the ground) at night. About of soap was recommended for a party of four for washing, bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub was also usually included to aid in washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred once or twice a month or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, fuel and time. Shaving was usually given up for the trip to save on water and bother. Tobacco was popular, both for personal use and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Some alcohol was typically taken for &quot;medicinal&quot; purposes—and used up along the way. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for cushioning the ride in the wagon if there were pregnant women or young children along. The wagons had no springs of any kind, and the ride along the trail was very rough—rough enough to churn butter if a cow was brought along. Despite modern depictions where nearly everybody rides, almost nobody unless a child, pregnant wife or injured traveler actually rode long in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough and too hard on the livestock. Most walked nearly all the way.

Travelers also brought books, Bibles, trail guides, writing quills, and ink and paper for keeping a diary or writing a letter.

Goods, supplies and equipment were often shared by fellow travelers. Other goods that were forgotten, broke or wore out could often be found discarded by someone else along the way or bought from a fellow traveler, post or fort along the way. Equipment and wheel repairs and other goods could often be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries along the way—most did a thriving business. New iron shoes for horses, mules and oxen were often put on by blacksmiths. Emergency supplies, repairs and livestock were often provided by local residents in Oregon, California and Utah for late travelers on the trail who were hurrying to beat the snow and had run out of supplies, broken down or needed fresh animals.

Along the way, non-essential items were often abandoned to lighten the load, or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or trading their lower quality items for better ones found along the road. In the early years, the Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and haul it to Salt Lake City where supplies of all kinds were needed. Blacksmiths there could then recycle the salvaged iron to make almost any iron/steel object needed. Others would use discarded wagons, wheels and furniture as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, Fort Laramie was known as &quot;Camp Sacrifice&quot; because of the large amounts of merchandise discarded nearby. Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their &#x27;luxury&#x27; items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Many of the smarter travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City where they could trade them for new supplies or money.

Some professional tools used by surgeons, blacksmiths, carpenters, farmers, etc. were carried by nearly all. Shovels, crow bars, picks, hoes, mattocks, saws, hammers, axes and hatchets were used to clear or make a road through trees or brush, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon where necessary. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often along the top of ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys. Because the wagons tipped over easily on a side hill they were often dragged straight up a steep hill, with multiple teams if necessary and then skidded straight down the opposite side with chained up wheels if required.

==Routes==
===Eastern migrant trails===
The Oregon, California, Mormon and later the shorter Bozeman (into Montana) Trails (sometimes called the Emigrant Trails) all went west along much of the same network of trails until Wyoming, Utah or Idaho, where they split off to reach their respective destinations. The exact route of the trail to get to California depended on the starting point of the trip, the final destination in California, the whims of the pioneers, the water and grass available on the trail, the threats of Indian attacks on parts of the trail, and the information they had or acquired along the way and the time of year. No government agents or bodies controlled the numbers and routing of the emigrants. The only &quot;help&quot; they could depend on was from their fellow travelers, a few blacksmiths and entrepreneurs running trading posts, and the few Army forts scattered along the road in Nebraska and Wyoming. In emergencies, the early pioneers, with and without Army help, nearly always organized relief parties.

To get the two essentials, water and grass for the travelers and their animals, the trails nearly always followed river valleys across the continent. The other &quot;essential,&quot; &#x27;wood&#x27; for fires, utilized any easily found burnable fuel—trees, brush, &#x27;buffalo chips&#x27;, abandoned wagons and supplies, sage brush, etc.. The wagons and their teams were the ultimate &quot;off road&quot; equipment in their time and were able to traverse incredibly steep mountain ranges, gullies, large and small streams, forests, brush, and other rough country. Initially, the almost total lack of improved roads severely constrained travel in some areas, as the pioneers had to detour, find, or make a way through or around difficult terrain. The trails, when not in flat country, typically went down ridge tops to avoid the trees and gullies normally found in valleys. When the Army established the shorter Central Overland Route in 1859 from Salt Lake City, Utah to Carson City, Nevada, it used local streams and springs found in the desert along the way. On the open plains, the wagons typically spread out to minimize traveling in dust. Later travelers typically used improvements and routes established by previous travelers. To be able to finish the four- to six-month trip in one season, most trips were started in early April or May, as soon as the grass was growing and the trails were dry enough to support the wagons. The trips hopefully terminated in early September or October before snow started falling again.

Feeder routes or Eastern branches of the named emigrant trails crossed the states of Missouri and Iowa before reaching and crossing the Missouri River. Initially, steamboat navigable waters on the Missouri River ended just upstream of Independence, Missouri/Kansas City, Kansas. By 1846, the Great Flood of 1844&#x27;s damage to up-river traffic was fixed, as primitive dredging had opened up the Missouri River as far as the Platte River confluence near Kanesville, Iowa (later renamed Council Bluffs). By 1853, Omaha, Nebraska, on the west bank, became the starting point of choice for many, as armed conflicts in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; made travel across Kansas more hazardous.

Many emigrants from the eastern seaboard traveled from the east coast across the Allegheny Mountains to Brownsville, Pennsylvania (a barge building and outfitting center) or Pittsburgh and thence down the Ohio River on flatboats or steamboats to St. Louis, Missouri. Many others from Europe traveled by sailing ship to the mouth of the Mississippi River where steam powered tugs towed them up river about to New Orleans, Louisiana. From there, cheap (about $5.00) and fast (about 6 days) steamboats brought them to St. Louis. Many bought most of their supplies, wagons and teams in St. Louis and then traveled by steamboats up the Missouri River to their departure point.

The main branch(es) of the trail started at one of several towns on the Missouri River—Independence/Kansas City, St. Joseph, Missouri, Kanesville and Omaha, plus others. Those starting in either St. Joseph/Independence, Missouri, or Kansas City, Kansas, typically followed the Santa Fe Trail route until they could be ferried across the Kansas and Wakarusa Rivers. They then followed either the Little Blue River or Republican River across Kansas and into Nebraska. If they started above the Kansas and Missouri River junction from the future town sites of Atchison, Kansas or Leavenworth, Kansas, they typically traversed northwest across the plains until they encountered the Big Blue River and its tributary, the Little Blue. The trail generally followed the Little Blue, which ended near the Platte River. The only general problem through the rolling hills of Kansas was the need to cross several large creeks or rivers with sharp banks. These required either doing a lot of work to dig a wagon ford, or using a previously established ford or toll bridge. In Nebraska and Kansas, Indian tribes ran many of the toll bridges or ferries.

If they started in Iowa or Nebraska, after getting across the Missouri River, most followed the northern side of the Platte River from near its junction on the Missouri River ferrying across the Elkhorn River and the wide and muddy Loup River, which intercept the Platte River. As the 1850s progressed and armed hostilities escalated in &quot;bleeding&quot; Kansas, travelers increasingly traveled up the Missouri River to leave from or near Omaha. After 1847, many ferries and steamboats were active during the emigration season start to facilitate crossing the Missouri to the Nebraska or Kansas side of the river.

When the Union Pacific Railroad started west in 1865, Omaha was their eastern terminus. The eastern end of the trail has been compared to a frayed rope of many strands that joined up at the Platte River near new Fort Kearny (est. 1848) in Nebraska. Those on the north side of the Platte would have to cross the Platte River to use the mail, repair and supply services available at Fort Kearny.

====Cholera and death on the trail====
The preferred camping spots for travelers on the trails north and south of the muddy Platte River were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera infections during the third cholera pandemic (1852–1860). Many thousands of people used the same camping spots whose water supplies became contaminated by human wastes. Cholera causes vomiting and severe diarrhea, and in places where human wastes contaminate water supplies the causal bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, could easily spread among travelers. Once the water supplies became contaminated, because the cholera bacillus is zoophilic (it can infect birds, various mammals, and live in micro-organisms) it could easily spread and remain a threat along much of the Trail. Cholera, when untreated, can result in fatality rates between fifty and ninety percent. Even after the British physician and pioneer of anesthesia, John Snow, had helped demonstrate that cholera was transmitted through water in 1854, it did not become common knowledge until decades later; scientists continued to debate the cause of cholera until the beginning of the twentieth century. Treatments were almost always ineffective and sometimes hastened death. It would have been a terrifying companion while crossing the desolate high plains and passes of the Rocky Mountain West.

Cholera killed many thousands in New York City, St. Louis, Missouri, New Orleans, Louisiana, and other towns on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who inadvertently drank cholera contaminated water. Cholera is thought to have been brought to these river cities, etc. and the California, Oregon and Mormon Trails by infected immigrants from Europe. These widespread infections and thousands of deaths finally gave impetus to building, at great cost, effective citywide water and sewage systems in many European and US cities.

Germs that caused cholera and other diseases were still undiscovered as a disease spreading mechanism in this era. The Germ theory of disease and the systematic observation of possible disease causing microorganisms were just starting in this era. The cause of cholera, ingesting invisible cholera germs from cholera-infected fecal contaminated water or food was not known. Although magnifying lenses had been discovered in 1592 effective microscopes that could see germs well were just being developed and widely used starting in the 1860s. The prevention or effective treatment for cholera, once patients were infected, were unknown in this era and death rates then sometimes reached 50% of infected people. Cholera infections spread rampantly in the era before possible sources of cholera were identified, cholera carriers isolated and before effective water and sewage treatment facilities were developed and deployed.

Many thousands of emigrants died in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming and were buried along the trail in unmarked graves.

===Great Platte River Road===
 

The Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and was too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for even a canoe to travel very far on as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River. The Platte River Valley, however, provided an easily passable wagon corridor sloping easily up as it went almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo meat and hides and &#x27;buffalo chips&#x27; for fire &#x27;wood&#x27;. There were trails on both sides of the muddy, about wide and shallow () Platte River. In all the trail(s) traveled about in the present state of Nebraska in the Platte River Valley. The Platte&#x27;s water was silty and bad-tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so allowed most of the silt to settle out.

Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte with its muddy and treacherous crossings using one of about three ferries (in dry years it could sometimes be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte into present-day Wyoming to Fort Laramie. After crossing over the South Platte the travelers encountered Ash Hollow with its steep descent down windlass hill. Several days further on they would encounter huge rock formations sticking out of the prairie called Courthouse Rock and further on the startling Chimney Rock, then Castle Rock, and finally Scotts Bluff. Before 1852 those on the North side ferried (or after about 1850 took a toll bridge) across the North Platte to the south side and Fort Laramie.

After 1852, they used Child&#x27;s Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of Casper, Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side. After crossing the Laramie River, the road west of Fort Laramie became much rougher as streams feeding the North Platte cut the terrain into many hills and ravines. The river was now often in a deep canyon, and the road had to veer away from it. Sallie Hester, an immigrant of 1850, described the terrain as something clawed by a gigantic bear: &quot;sixty miles of the worst road in the world.&quot; In all from Omaha, Nebraska () the Platte and North Platte were followed for about to Casper (). Fortunately, swifter flowing waters after Fort Laramie seemed to minimize the chance for cholera germ transmission, and its fatal attacks diminished significantly.

===Sweetwater River===
Continuing upstream from Casper, the North Platte bends to the southwest headed for the Colorado Rockies. About southwest of Casper the North Platte is joined by the Sweetwater River (Wyoming). This river junction is deep in a canyon now filled by the Pathfinder Reservoir. The trail crossed over the North Platte by ferry and later by bridge. Some of the original immigrant travelers proceeded several miles along the North Platte River to Red Buttes, where a bend in the river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The cold North Platte was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the water less stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.

Upon arrival in the Sweetwater valley, the trail encounters one of the most important landmarks on the trail, Independence Rock. Independence Rock was named by Jedediah Smith and party when they first observed it in 1824 on July 4--Independence Day in the United States. Jedediah and his fellow trappers rediscovered South Pass and the Sweetwater River in 1824. Immigrants also tried to reach Independence Rock on July 4 in order to help ensure that they will be at their destinations in California or Oregon before the winter snows came and closed the trails. Many of the travelers left their names on the rock, either carved or painted on with axle grease. It is estimated that more than 50,000 signatures were inscribed on Independence Rock. Other notable landmarks along the Sweetwater valley include Split Rock, Devil&#x27;s Gate and Martin&#x27;s Cove, where, in October to November 1856, the Martin Handcart Company was stranded by an early heavy snow and a late start and about 145 died before they were rescued by the rescue parties (about 250 wagons with supplies and help were dispatched from Utah) sent by Brigham Young from Salt Lake City.

The immigrant trail continues west along the Sweetwater River eventually crossing the meandering river nine times, including three times within a section through a narrow canyon in the Rattlesnake Hills. Prior to the 6th crossing, the trail crossed an unusual location known as Ice Slough. A covering of peat like vegetation grew over a small stream. The stream froze in winter and didn&#x27;t thaw until early summer due to the insulating layer of vegetation. The ice was a welcome treat for settlers who were often enduring temperatures over in July. The trail crosses the Sweetwater three more times and encounters a large hill known as Rocky Ridge on the northern side of the river. This barren and rocky section lasted almost , and was considered a major obstacle in the trail. The same storm in November 1856 that debilitated the Martin Handcart Company also stranded the Willie Handcart Company on the eastern side of the ridge. Before rescuers could arrive, 56 people died in freezing temperatures out of a company of about 600. Following Rocky Ridge, the trail descends one more time into the Sweetwater valley to the ninth and final crossing of the Sweetwater at Burnt Ranch.

In 1853, a new route named Seminoe cutoff was established on the southern side of the river. It was named after trapper Basil LaJeunesse who was referred to as Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe cutoff split from the main trail at the 6th crossing and rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used extensively in the 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.

Immediately after crossing the Sweetwater at Burnt Ranch the trail crosses the continental divide at South Pass, unarguably the most important landmark on the entire trail. South Pass itself is an unimpressive open saddle between the Wind River Range to the north and the Antelope Hills to the south, but it represented a major milestone in the trip. In 1848, Congress created the Oregon Territory which included all the territory in Wyoming west of the Continental Divide. Crossing South Pass meant that the settlers had truly arrived in the Oregon Territory, though their ultimate destination was still a great distance away. Nearby Pacific Springs offered the first water since the trail had left the Sweetwater River and marked the beginning of a relatively dry stretch of trail until the settlers reached Big Sandy River that joined with the Green River more than away.

===Main trail from South Pass through Fort Bridger to the Humboldt River===
The main trail after crossing the South Pass encountered a number of small springs and creeks before hitting the Green River. After ferrying across the Green the main trail went on to Fort Bridger. Here they could take the Mormon Trail to Salt Lake City or go to Fort Hall. The main trail going to Fort Hall went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Divide to the pleasant Bear River Valley. The Bear River wanders about through three states as it makes a large inverted U around the north end of the Wasatch Range and then turns south and eventually empties into the Great Salt Lake as part of the Great Basin drainage system. The trail along the Bear usually had good grass, water, good fishing and wood. Once on the Bear River they followed the Bear&#x27;s valley mostly north along today&#x27;s Utah, Idaho, Wyoming border. In the Thomas Fork area, the trail is forced to go up &quot;Big Hill&quot; to by-pass a narrow canyon filled by the Bear River (Today&#x27;s U.S. Route 30 blasted and bulldozed a wider canyon to follow the river). Big Hill had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent (wagon trail scars are still visible today). A few miles further north is present day Montpelier, Idaho (site of an Oregon-California Trail interpretive Center). They followed the Bear River to present-day Soda Springs, Idaho. Here, there were many hot springs, mineral deposits, wood, and good grass and water. Many travelers stopped there for a few days to refresh their animals, themselves, wash clothes etc. A few miles after Soda Springs, the Bear River turned southwest towards the Great Salt Lake, and the main trail turned northwest near &quot;Sheep&#x27;s Rock&quot; to follow the Portneuf River valley to Fort Hall (Idaho) in the Oregon Country along the Snake River. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall was about taking nine to twelve days.

About west of Soda Springs, &quot;Hudspeth&#x27;s Cutoff&quot; (est. 1849) took off from the main trail heading almost due west and by-passed Fort Hall. Hudspeth&#x27;s Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it did spread out the traffic on busy years and made more grass available.

The original California Trail pioneers, the Bartleson–Bidwell Party, only knew that California was west of Soda Springs—somewhere. They lacked guides or information on the best route west to California. Shortly after Soda Springs the Bear River heads southwest as it rounds the Wasatch Mountains and heads for the Great Salt Lake. Not knowing what else to do and knowing they needed grass and water, they followed the river. After following the Bear and building a trail through Cache Valley, Utah and crossing over the Malad Mountains, they got to somewhere near today&#x27;s Bear River City, Utah. Then they realized the Bear River was going to terminate in the Great Salt Lake. Continuing west by going north of the Great Salt Lake across numerous alkali and salt-encrusted flats, they had a very difficult time because of the few springs and poor feed available for their animals. They finally abandoned their wagons in eastern Nevada when they realized the route they were on was getting ever rougher and they had missed the head of the Humboldt River. In addition, their animals were getting in ever poorer condition. After a very hard struggle they finished their trip to California successfully by building pack saddles for their horses, oxen and mules and converting their wagon train into a pack train. After finally finding the Humbodlt, they continued slogging west and continuing to struggle through most of November 1841 getting over the Sierra—gradually killing and eating up their oxen for food as their food supplies dwindled. The long and very difficult trail they had blazed was used by virtually none of the succeeding emigrants. (See: NPS California Trail Map for the &quot;Bartleson–Bidwell Route&quot;) The very successful Salt Lake Cutoff, developed in 1848, went over much the same territory in Utah but stayed further north of the Great Salt Lake and had much better access to water and grass.

West of Fort Hall, the trail traveled about on the south side of the Snake River southwest towards present day Lake Walcott (reservoir) on the Snake River. At the junction of the Raft River and Snake River, the trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another &quot;Parting of the Ways&quot; junction by leaving the Snake River and following the small and short Raft River about southwest past present day Almo, Idaho and the City of Rocks. Hudspeth&#x27;s Cutoff rejoined the California trail at Cassia Creek on the Raft River about northeast of the City of Rocks. Nearly all were impressed by the City of Rocks—now a national reserve and Idaho State Park. Near the City of Rocks is where the Salt Lake Cutoff rejoined the California Trail. (For Oregon-California trail map in Idaho see: Oregon-California Trail in Idaho for trails in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah etc. see NPS National Trail Map.)

===Cutoffs between South Pass and Humboldt River===
The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff (established 1844) cut about off the main route through Fort Bridger. It left the main emigrant trail about from South Pass at Parting of the Ways junction and then headed almost due west. About further they encountered Big Sandy River—about ten feet wide and one foot deep. This was the last water before crossing about of desert consisting of soft dry soil that rose in suffocating clouds before reaching the next water at the Green River about below the present town of La Barge, Wyoming. Here, the Green cut a steep channel through the Green River Desert, which travelers had to descend by a steep rocky path to reach the life-giving water. Often, thirsty teams stampeded to the water with terrible results. The descent was soon scattered with fragments of many wagons and dead animals. The Sublette cutoff saved about but the typical price was numerous dead oxen and the wrecks of many wagons. After crossing the Green they then had to continue crossing mountain ranges where the trail gets over in several places before finally connecting with the main trail near today&#x27;s Cokeville, Wyoming in the Bear River valley. (For map See: Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff Map,)


The Green River is a major tributary of the Colorado River and is a large, deep and powerful river. It ranges from wide in the upper course where it typically was forded and ranges from in depth. After the opening of the Oregon, California and Mormon trails, several ferries were set up to cross it at both the main trail and the Sublette Cutoff; but during peak travel seasons in July the wait to cross was often several days. At the Green River on the main trail after crossing the river many took the Slate Creek Cutoff (also called the Kinney Cutoff), which turned north up the Green River for about before turning almost due west to connect to the Sublette Cutoff road. This cutoff eliminated most of the waterless desert crossing of the Sublette Cutoff.

====Salt Lake Cutoff====
After 1848, those needing repairs, fresh livestock, fresh vegetables, fruit or other supplies could stay on the Mormon Trail for about from Fort Bridger to Salt Lake City, Utah and other Utah towns. Salt Lake City, located at about halfway on the trip, was the only significant settlement along the route. From Salt Lake City they could easily get back to the California (or Oregon) Trail by following the Salt Lake Cutoff about from Salt Lake City northwest around the north end of Great Salt Lake, rejoining the main trail at the City of Rocks near the present Idaho-Utah border. The trip from Fort Bridger via Salt Lake City to the City of Rocks was about —about shorter than the trail via Fort Hall.

====Mormon Road: Southern Route of the California Trail====

Hundreds of late arriving Forty-niners, and some parties of Mormons, both packers and teamsters, looking to avoid the fate of the Donner Party, in the fall and winter of 1849–1850 used the snow free Southern Route to Southern California. This route, that ran southwest from Salt Lake City, was pioneered by Jefferson Hunt in 1847–48 and a party of veterans of the Mormon Battalion returning from California in 1848. From Parowan onward to the southwest, the original route closely followed the route of the Old Spanish Trail diverting from that route between the Virgin River at Halfway Wash to Resting Springs, following the cutoff discovered by John Fremont on his return from California in 1844. This road only diverted to find places that could be traversed by the wagons of Mormon and Forty-niner parties that pioneered it. Later immigrants and the Mormon colonists of San Bernardino, in the early 1850s followed it. At the same time along what became known as the Mormon Road were seeded the Mormon settlements that developed into towns and cities of modern Utah, Arizona, Nevada and Southern California.

====The Lander Road====
The Lander Road, located further north than the main trail to Fort Hall, also bypassed Fort Bridger and was about shorter to Fort Hall. It was built under the supervision of Frederick W. Lander by federal contractors in 1858—one of the first federally sponsored roads in the west. Lander&#x27;s Road officially was called the &quot;Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake Road&quot; and was a federally funded attempt to improve the Oregon and California trails. The little used Honey Lake part of the proposed route near the present states of Nevada and California border was improved in 1859 under Lander&#x27;s direction but did not go much beyond improving some watering holes—work ceased in 1860. The &quot;Lander Road&quot; was the first section of the federally funded road through the future states of Wyoming and Idaho. Expeditions under the command of Frederick W. Lander surveyed a new route starting at Burnt Ranch following the last crossing of the Sweetwater River before it turned west over South Pass. The Lander Road followed the Sweetwater River further north, skirting the Wind River Range before turning west and crossing the continental divide north of South Pass. The road crossed the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming; then it passes over Thompson Pass in the Wyoming Range near the head of the Grey&#x27;s River; and then it crosses another high pass across the Salt River Range before descending into Star Valley (Wyoming). The trail entered Star Valley about south of the present town of Smoot, Wyoming. From Smoot, the road then continued north about down Star Valley west of the Salt River before turning almost due west at Stump Creek near the present town of Auburn, Wyoming and passing into the present state of Idaho and following the Stump Creek valley about northwest over the Caribou Mountains (Idaho) (this section of the trail is now accessible only by US Forest Service path as the main road (Wyoming Highway 34) now goes through Tincup canyon to get across the Caribous.) After crossing the Caribou Range the road split, turning almost ninety degrees and progressing southwest to Soda Springs, Idaho, or alternately heading almost due west and passing south of Grays Lake (now part of the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge) to Fort Hall Idaho. The Lander Road had good grass, fishing, water and wood but was high, rough and steep in many places. Later, after 1869, it was mostly used by ranchers moving their stock to and from summer grazing or markets.

By crossing the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and water for the travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trains going to Fort Hall. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not a sure thing just before, during and after the American Civil War. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men (hired in Utah) completed the road in Wyoming and Idaho in 90 days, clearing timber and moving about of earth. The Lander&#x27;s road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used. Records after 1859 are lacking and its use after that period are assumed to sharply decrease since the Sublette Cutoff, the Central Overland Route and other cutoffs were just about as fast or faster and were much less strenuous. Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.

===South Pass to the Central Overland Route===
An alternative route, the Central Overland Route, across Utah and Nevada that bypassed both Fort Hall and the Humboldt River trails was developed in 1859. This route was discovered, surveyed and developed by a team of U.S. Army workers led by Captain James H. Simpson of the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and went from individual streams and springs across the Great Basin Desert in central Utah and Nevada—avoiding the Humboldt River trail and its often combative Indians and Forty Mile Desert. This route was about shorter and over ten days quicker. The route followed the Mormon Trail from South Pass to the newly settled Salt Lake City, Utah and passed south of the Great Salt Lake across central Utah and Nevada. The route today is approximated today by the roads from: Salt Lake City, Utah, Fairfield, Utah (then called Camp Floyd), Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Callao, Utah, Ibapah, Utah to Ely, Nevada. From Ely the route is approximated by the U.S. Route 50 in Nevada from Ely, Nevada, to Carson City, Nevada. (See: Pony Express Map) Many California bound travelers took the about and over two weeks shorter Central Overland Route to Salt Lake City and across central Utah and Nevada. Initially the springs and trail were maintained by the army as a western supply route to Camp Floyd, which was set up after the Utah War of 1856–57. By 1860 Camp Floyd was abandoned as the army left to fight the U.S. Civil War and the Central Overland Route was their only long term legacy.

Starting in March 1860 and continuing until October 1861 the Pony express established many small relay stations along the Central Overland Route for their mail express riders. From the end of Central Overland route in Carson City, Nevada, they followed the Johnson Pass (Placerville route) to California since it was the fastest and only route that was then kept open in winter across the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) mountains. On March 2, 1861, before the American Civil War had actually begun at Fort Sumter, the United States Government formally revoked the contract of the Butterfield Overland Stagecoach Company in anticipation of the coming conflict. A more secure route for communication and passengers between the non-Confederate states and the west was needed. The stock, coaches, etc., on the southern Gila River route Butterfield Stage route through or close to some potential Confederate states were pulled off and moved to a new route between St. Joseph, Missouri and Placerville, California along the existing Oregon, California Trails to Salt Lake City and then through central Utah and Nevada. It took about three months to make the transfer of stages and stock, and to build a number of new stations, secure hay and grain, and get everything in readiness for operating a six-times-a-week mail line. On June 30, 1861, the &quot;Central Overland California Route&quot; from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Placerville, California, went into effect. By traveling day and night and using frequent team changes the stages could make the trip in about 28 days. News paper correspondents reported that they had a preview of hell when they took the trip.

These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the first transcontinental telegraph stations (completed October 24, 1861). From Salt Lake City, the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon-California-Oregon trail to Omaha, Nebraska. After the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, the telegraph lines along the railroad tracks became the main line, since the required relay stations, lines and telegraph operators were much easier to supply and maintain along the railroad. The telegraph lines that diverged from the railroad lines or significant population centers were largely abandoned.

===Across the Great Basin on the Humboldt River===

The Humboldt River is fed by melting snow flowing from the Ruby and other mountains in north central Nevada and runs over mostly westward across the Great Basin to the Humboldt Sink in western Nevada where it evaporates. The Great Basin covers essentially all of Nevada and parts of Utah, Idaho, Oregon and California and has no outlet to the sea. The Great Basin lies in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and what little rainfall occurs there—stays there. The Humboldt, headed nearly straight west, provided an easily followed pathway with feed and water across the Great Basin desert. The Humboldt was praised for having water, fishing and feed along its banks and also cursed for its barely adequate grass, meandering and often muddy channel, and hot weather. Its water quality became progressively worse the further the river went west. The fire &#x27;wood&#x27; needed for cooking and making coffee consisted of occasional junipers and ever present sagebrush and willows.

As found by about 1844, the trail at &quot;parting of the ways&quot; (Idaho) from the Snake River leads along the Raft River about southwest to the head of the Raft River and the City of Rocks (now called: City of Rocks National Reserve). The Hudspeth Cutoff and the Salt Lake Cutoff all rejoined the California Trail near the City of Rocks (For maps see NPS map California Trail:). The trail then continued west over Granite Pass, which involved a steep, treacherous descent. West of Granite Pass, the trail was in the Great Basin drainage. Rainfall in the Great Basin either flowed to the Humboldt River, sank into the ground or evaporated. The trail then jogged northwest until it reached Goose Creek where it headed southwest, nicking the far northwest corner of Utah and on into the future state of Nevada. The trail then headed southwest, down Goose Creek for about until it hit Thousand Springs Valley&#x27;s creeks and springs. The trail followed Thousand Springs Valley until it intercepted West Brush Creek and Willow Creek, which run into the Humboldt River. This about trail through Idaho and Nevada connecting the Snake River to the Humboldt River passed enough springs and creeks to provide the necessary feed and water for the California bound emigrants. The trail hit the Humboldt River in northeastern Nevada near present-day Wells, Nevada. Another branch of the trail went through Bishops Canyon and intercepted the trail about west of Wells.() Humboldt Wells had good water and grass. The distance from City of Rocks to Wells was about .

The trail followed the north banks of the Humboldt west for about until it encountered the narrow long Carlin Canyon on the Humboldt. Here the meandering river passed through a steep section of mountains, and its river valley became very narrow or only the width of the stream bed. Various trail guides said you would have to ford the Humboldt from four to nine times to get through the canyon. Carlin Canyon became nearly impassable during periods of high water and a cutoff, the Greenhorn Cutoff, was developed to bypass the canyon when flooded. West of Carlin Canyon, the trail climbed through Emigrant Pass and then descended again to rejoin the Humboldt at Gravelly Ford (near today&#x27;s Beowawe, Nevada). At Gravelly Ford the often muddy Humboldt had a good gravel bottom and was easily forded. There was usually plenty of grass and fresh water springs nearby. Many stayed here a while to rest and recuperate their livestock and themselves. After the ford, the trail divided into two branches, following the north and south banks of the river. The trail on the north side of the river was much better, allowing an easy miss of the Reese River sink. Those who took the south side would have to travel around a big bend in the Humboldt and then cross the usually dry alkali-laden Reese River sink. The two branches of the Trail rejoined at Humboldt Bar (sink).

At the Humboldt Sink (about northeast of present-day Reno, Nevada) the Humboldt River disappeared into a marshy alkali laden lake that late in some years was a dry lake bed. Near the end of the Humboldt, one of the worst sections of the California Trail showed up, the Forty Mile Desert.

The Truckee River, which drains the Lake Tahoe basin and Donner Lake, and the Carson River, which drains Hope Valley and adjacent mountains, are two major rivers that flow eastward out of the Sierra Nevada into the Great Basin and are only about from the end of the Humboldt. The Truckee River terminates in Pyramid Lake with a salinity approximately 1/6 that of sea water and supports several species of fish. The Carson River disappears into another alkali-laden marsh called the Carson Sink. All California Trail emigrants would have to cross the Forty Mile Desert to get to either river. Before crossing the Forty Mile Desert, the California main trail splits with one branch going towards the Truckee River Route (or &quot;Truckee Trail&quot;) (est. 1844) going roughly almost due west where Interstate 80 goes today towards the site of modern-day Wadsworth, Nevada. The Truckee was called the Salmon-Trout River on Fremont&#x27;s 1848 map of the area. The Carson Trail branch (est. 1848) went roughly from today&#x27;s I-80 and U.S. Highway 95 junction to modern day Fallon, Nevada, (near Rag Town) southwest across Forty Mile Desert to the Carson River.

The Forty Mile Desert was a barren stretch of waterless alkali wasteland that stretched from Humboldt Bar to both the Carson and Truckee rivers and beyond. The desert covered an area of over , forming a fire box: its loose, white, salt-covered sands and baked alkali clay wastes reflected the sun&#x27;s heat onto the stumbling travelers and animals. What few plants there are typically covered with thorns and live low to the ground.

The annual rainfall in the Forty mile desert is only It was one of the most dreaded sections of the California Trail, as emigrants reached it just when they were often weak, tired, and nearly out of food. They were also often suffering from scurvy, and their animals and equipment were often worn out. They were about from the end of the trail and had been traveling on the trail from four to six months. For many emigrants, Forty Mile Desert was the end of their trail. Most emigrants got there in late August through early October—one of the hottest, driest times of the year. If possible, they traveled the desert by night because of the great heat, but it often took over a day and a night to traverse. About halfway across the desert on the &quot;Truckee Trail&quot;, they came to a foul tasting hot springs (now a thermal power plant), but its water was usually too hot for even very thirsty animals to consume. Many dead animals were concentrated at and in these &quot;bad&quot; water springs—often preventing access to them. Water had to be pooled off and allowed to cool before it could be used by man or beast. The trail on the last the alkali flats gave way to soft alkali laden sand, six to ten inches (15–25 cm) deep and very hard for the animals to pull the wagons through. The ground was littered with the debris of goods, abandoned wagons and dead and dying animals that had all been discarded in a desperate attempt by the pioneers to make it all the way across. Often a wagon would be abandoned and the team would be unhooked and taken on alone to get water. After drinking their fill of fresh water and recuperating on the other side, many would go back and retrieve their wagon—others simply abandoned them there. Many animals (and people) died on this crossing. A count made in 1850 showed these appalling statistics for Forty Mile Desert: 1,061 dead mules, about 5,000 dead horses, 3,750 dead cattle and oxen, and 953 emigrant graves.

The main route of the California Trail until 1848 is approximated by modern Nevada State Route 233 in eastern Nevada and Interstate 80 in central and western Nevada. The section of the trail from Wells, Nevada, to City of Rocks in Idaho can be approximated by starting at Wells, going north on US Route 93 to Wilkins, Nevada, and then turning onto a gravel county road 765 (Wilkins Montello Rd), that goes from Wilkins to the Goose Creek Road that goes through Nevada and back into Idaho—not advised for winter or spring use.

===Crossing the Sierra Nevada===
The high, rugged Carson Range and Sierra Nevada mountains on the eastern California border were the final obstacles that had to be overcome before westbound travelers could proceed. The Sierra Nevada comprise a large block of weather-worn granite tilted towards the west. They extend about from near the Fandango Pass in the north to the Tehachapi Pass in the south. The western slopes are scarred by glacier and river carved canyons but slope much more gradually west taking about to fall from their rugged over crests to the about elevation of the Central Valley. The even more rugged glacier and river scarred eastern slopes are typically much more precipitous, rising to the rugged Sierra crest from their about base in the Great Basin in many places in less than .

Precipitation in the Sierra Nevada flows to the Pacific Ocean if it falls on the western slope of the range. If precipitation falls on the eastern side of the Sierra crest it flows into the Great Basin where it evaporates, sinks underground or flows into lakes or sinks (mostly saline). These sinks are often dry alkali laden flats late in the year. The eastern side lies in a rain shadow getting much less rain than the western side. Creeks, streams, or rivers originating east of the Sierra crest find no outlet to either the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Ocean. (The water piped over the Sierra to Los Angeles is the only exception.)

A second smaller but yet significant block of weather worn granite formed the Carson Range of mountains located east of today&#x27;s Lake Tahoe, between the two ranges. From the Humboldt River Route, first the Carson Range and then the Sierra would have to be passed to get to western California. Even today there are only about nine roads that go over the Sierra and about half of these may be closed in winter.

====Truckee Trail====
The Truckee Trail (established 1844 by the Stephens–Townsend–Murphy Party) over the Sierra Nevada took about to cross Forty Mile Desert but it did have a hot springs in about the middle that could be consumed if given time to cool. After hitting the Truckee River just as it turned almost due north towards Pyramid Lake near today&#x27;s Wadsworth, Nevada, the emigrants had crossed the dreaded Forty Mile Desert. The emigrants blessed the Truckee&#x27;s cool and sweet tasting water, fresh grass and the cool shade from the first trees (cottonwoods) the emigrants had seen in hundreds of miles. The travelers often rested themselves and their animals for a few days before proceeding. Real shade, grass for their animals and no more bitter, soapy-tasting Humboldt River water were much appreciated. The Truckee Trail followed the Truckee River past present day Reno, Nevada (then called Big Meadows) and went west until they encountered Truckee River Canyon near the present Nevada-California border. This canyon was one of the paths across the Carson Range of mountains. This steep, narrow, rock and cold water filled canyon could be traversed by wagons but required about 27 crossings of the cold Truckee River and much prying and shoving to get wagons and teams over the rocks to proceed up the canyon.

In 1845, Caleb Greenwood and his three sons developed a new route that by-passed the rough and rugged trail up the Truckee River Canyon by leaving the river near the present town of Verdi, Nevada and following a ravine northwest over a pass across the Carson Range (followed today by the Henness Pass Road) and down to Dog Valley and from there southwest down through the present Stampede and Prosser Creek Reservoirs before rejoining the Truckee trail near today&#x27;s Truckee, California. This was about longer route but it avoided most of the continual crossings of the rock filled Truckee River and became the main route for the Truckee Trail. Initially, the trail passed to the north of Lake Tahoe and then followed Donner Creek to the north side of Donner Lake before ascending the precipitous climb north of the lake to Donner Pass. There were several Truckee routes over the Sierra here over time but nearly all required the wagons to be disassembled and hoisted straight up various cliffs using multiple teams to get the wagon parts and goods to the top. Some cliffs were ascended by tilting tall fallen trees against the cliffs and using multiple teams to pull the wagons up the improvised steep ramps. All routes required using multiple teams to get the wagons to the top and differing amounts of wagon dis-assembly. The trail initially crossed the Sierra crest through Donner Pass.

From Donner summit, the trail then proceeded on a rugged cliff and rock-strewn path down the South Fork of the Yuba River—fed by an alpine lake. The first resting spot after the pass for many was beautiful Summit Valley (now mostly covered by Lake Van Norden reservoir) a few miles from the summit.


The trail down the western slope of the Sierra from Donner pass had enormous granite boulders and numerous rocky outcrops and steep slopes before passing through Emigrant Gap (California). Here a Historical marker on Interstate 80 reads: &quot;The spring of 1845 saw the first covered wagons surmount the Sierra Nevada. They left the valley, ascended to the ridge, and turned westward to old Emigrant Gap, where they were lowered their wagons by ropes to the floor of Bear River (Feather River tributary) Valley. Hundreds of wagons followed before, during, and after the gold rush. This was a hazardous portion of the overland emigrant trail.&quot; After getting down off the ridge most emigrants stayed at Bear Valley to rest themselves and their teams and recover before traveling the approximate remaining to Sutter&#x27;s Fort. This combination of a very steep and difficult ascent and a sharp difficult descent into Bear Valley on a route that terminated far from the gold strike regions all combined to make the Truckee Trail little used after about 1849 when the Carson Trail was developed. The main route quickly became variations of the Carson Trail which was rough but not as difficult as the Truckee Trail and terminated in the main gold digging regions around Placerville, California.

After being nearly abandoned, several branches of the Truckee Trail were eventually developed in the early 1860s for freight wagons and emigrants going both ways on the California trail. To be more useful the Truckee Trail needed extensive and expensive work spent on it. The route of the Truckee trail was chosen as the &quot;best&quot; way to get a railroad over the Sierra. In 1863 the Central Pacific Railroad put about 300 men to work on the trail and spent over $300,000 (~$ in ) working on a new toll road roughly following the original Truckee route with several new upgrades. In 1864, the CPRR opened the Dutch Flat Donner Lake Toll Wagon Road (DFDLWR) to earn money hauling freight to Nevada while also supplying their railroad workers building the First transcontinental railroad from Dutch Flat California over the Donner summit and on to what today is Verdi, Nevada. The freight going to the gold and silver strikes in Nevada at the Comstock Lode were calculated to pay about $13,000,000 per year in wagon tolls—a fraction of this was well worth pursuing. One branch of the original Lincoln Highway over Donner summit built in about 1925 climbed the eastern Sierra to Donner Pass with multiple steep switchbacks. Today, the part of Interstate 80 in California and Nevada from 40 Mile Desert, Truckee River, Donner Pass, Sacramento very roughly approximates the original Truckee Trail route.

====Roller Pass on the Truckee Route====
Starting in about 1846, the Joseph Aram party found an alternate route on the south side of Donner Lake. Their route ran past the future town of Truckee, California up Coldstream Canyon south of Donner Lake to a saddle between Mt. Judah and Mt. Lincoln, about south of Donner&#x27;s pass. Here the final climb was up over the somewhat higher but less precipitous Roller Pass. The oxen were taken to the top where they could pull on more or less level ground and about of chain was let down to a wagon and twelve or more yoke of oxen then pulled the wagon up the final steep (about 30 degree) slope. To minimize friction on the chain it ran over round logs (rollers) put at the top.(Roller Pass Truckee Trail Map) By not requiring dis-assembly and allowing the wagon to stay packed this was a much faster way to the top but was still tortuously slow taking two to three days or longer to get to the top with wagon, people, animals and goods. In about 1848 or 1849 a large group of pioneers cut a switchback trail over the final steep section of Roller Pass, eliminating the need for rollers and chains to get over Roller Pass. From the top of the pass all the pioneers could see was a rugged mountain slope headed west that would require almost more of strenuous and dangerous effort to get to their goals.

====Nevada City Road====
Branching off the Truckee Trail was the Nevada City Road (est 1850) to Nevada City. This cutoff is closely followed today by California State Route 20 from Emigrant Gap on Interstate 80 to Nevada City, California.
Portions of the Nevada City Trail are evident at the top of Coyote Street, and North Bloomfield Road, just north of Nevada City. Plaques can be found where these roads meet the top of Harmony Ridge, as this was the ridge used to descend from the High Sierra, to the foothills of California.

====Auburn Emigrant Road====
The Auburn Emigrant Road (1852) from the Truckee trail to Auburn was established to bring emigrants to the new gold diggings at Auburn, California. Its thought to have extended from roughly present day Nevada City, California, roughly the end of the Truckee Trail, to Auburn. California State Route 49 from Auburn to Nevada City approximates this path. Later toll roads would be built along the rough pack trail from Auburn to Emigrant Gap (California) where Interstate 80 and the Central Pacific Railroad would later go. In 1852 Auburn was reachable by wagons from Sacramento.

====Henness Pass Road====
The Henness Pass Road (est. 1850) was an trail over the Sierra from today&#x27;s Verdi, Nevada (Dog Valley) to Camptonville and Marysville, California. The route was developed as a wagon toll route by Patrick Henness starting in about 1850. The Henness Pass Road was located about north of the Truckee trail. The route went from The Truckee Trail in Dog Valley (near today&#x27;s Verdi, Nevada) up the Little Truckee River to Webber Lake to the summit, through Henness Pass, along the ridge dividing the North and Middle Yuba Rivers and into Camptonville and Marysville. After extensive road work, paid for in part by Marysville, California commercial interests, freight could be shipped by steamboat to Marysville and picked up there for shipment over the Sierra. After 1860, extensions went southward to Carson City, Nevada, and on to the Comstock Lode in Virginia City, Nevada. Beginning in 1860 and continuing for some nine years, the road underwent major improvements, becoming one of the busiest trans-Sierra trails being favored by teamsters and stage drivers over the Placerville Route (Johnson Cutoff) because of its lower elevations, easier grades, and access to ship cargo. Many summer camps and relay stations were created along the route at roughly seven to ten-mile (16 km) intervals to accommodate oxen, horse and mule-powered wagons. In busy times the wagons traveled all day, filling the road, and the six or so stages traveled at night. The route was given up by most teamsters when the Central Pacific Railroad and Virginia and Truckee Railroad were completed in 1869, and it became cheaper and easier to ship freight by the railroad(s). People in Virginia City reported a 20–50% lower cost for supplies when the railroads were put in. Today the Henness wagon road is a mostly gravel U.S. Forest Service road called the Henness Pass Road from Verdi Nevada to Camptonville, California.

====Beckwourth Trail====
The Beckwourth Trail (est. 1850 by James Beckwourth) left the Truckee River Route at Truckee Meadows (now the site of Sparks, Nevada) and proceeded north along roughly the route of Stanford Way to Wedekind Road to U.S. Route 395 before crossing the Sierra on what is now California State Route 70 at Beckwourth Pass. After crossing the pass, the trail passed west along the ridge tops (avoiding Feather River Canyon) through present day Plumas, Butte and Yuba counties into California&#x27;s Central Valley, finally terminating at Marysville. The Oroville-Quincy Highway (California State Route 162) and California State Route 70 from Quincy to Highway 395 in general follow the path of the original Beckwourth Trail.

====Carson Trail====
The much used Carson Trail (est. 1848) (also called Mormon Emigrant Trail) crossed Forty Mile Desert by leaving the Humboldt Sink and skirting the western edge of the Carson Sink and hit the Carson River near modern-day Fallon, Nevada. The Carson Trail was named after the Carson River, which was in turn named after Kit Carson, scout for John Charles Fremont who had guided the Fremont party over the Sierra through what was subsequently called Carson Pass in February 1844. The trail across the Forty Mile Desert had the usual of loose sand that made traversing the desert very hard for the often tired and worn out draft animals. The Forty Mile Desert had water in about the middle, Salt Creek, but it was poisonous to drink. The trail through the desert was soon cluttered with discarded supplies, thousands of dead and dying animals, abandoned wagons, and hundreds of emigrant graves. Some estimated that only about half the wagons that started the trip across Forty Mile Desert got to the other side.

The Carson Trail was initially developed by about 45 discharged members of the Mormon Battalion. They, together with one woman, were driving 17 wagons and about 300 head of horse and cattle east to Salt Lake City in 1848. The wagons were veterans of the 1846 or 1847 emigration as California had at that time no facilities for building anything besides simple solid wheeled ox carts. They followed Iron Mountain Ridge southeast of what is now Placerville, California (there were essentially no settlements east of Sutter&#x27;s Fort in 1848) before hitting Tragedy Spring near Silver Lake. Here they found three of their scouts murdered. The unknown culprits were believed to have been Native Americans. From there the Mormon group ascended to at West Pass and then dropped down to Caples Lake. From there they went through Carson Pass, elevation . The only way down to the valley below was very steep ridge requiring many changes in direction with ropes and chains before they reached Red Lake at the head of Hope Valley. To get across the Carson Range of mountains the trail then followed the Carson River, traveling about in a very rough stretch of the Carson River canyon. The canyon was filled with boulders and rocks that had often fallen over a thousand feet into the canyon carved by the river through the Carson Range. In some places the canyon had to be widened enough for wagons to pass and impassable boulders removed by the Mormons headed east. They found that if they started a fire (driftwood was easily available) on boulders or impassably narrow canyon walls the hot rocks became easily breakable when doused with cold water and hit by picks and shovels. After several applications of fire, water and industrious pick use, the parts of the trail that were formerly impassable were opened up. In about 1853, the road through the canyon was converted intermittently to a toll road and made much easier to use when even more large boulders were removed and two permanent bridges were constructed.

Travelers heading west in 1848 and later, crossed Forty Mile Desert, then followed the trail blazed by the Mormons in 1848 up the Carson River valley from what is now Fallon, Nevada, in 1850 the town was called &quot;Ragtown&quot;. Then, to get over the Carson Range, it was a very rough road through Carson River Canyon where the wagons had to be wrestled over the boulders by ropes, pry bars, levers and a few improvised bridges before the wagon trains finally entered beautiful Hope Valley. Westward travelers from Hope Valley had to climb a steep, rocky and tortuous path over the back wall of a glacier carved cirque to reach Carson Pass. The section of trail at the end of Hope Valley near Red Lake is called &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Ladder&quot; where the trail has to climb over of very steep mountain in the final half mile (1 km). Today, a hiker&#x27;s careful eye can still find notches, grooves and rust marks left by iron rimmed wagon wheels. Nearby, trees scarred by ropes, chains and pulleys used to haul the heavy wagons up the precipitous slope, can be seen. Travelers could get to the top of the pass in about one day of hard work, an acceptable trade-off for many emigrants. The trail crossed the Sierra Crest through Carson Pass.

At that time, the trail forward was blocked by the Carson Spur, a sharp ridge not passable by wagons. To proceed, the Carson Trail had to follow the path blazed by the Mormons and make a sharp turn south at what is now Caples Lake (reservoir) and ascend West Pass before finally making it over the Sierra Crest. The half day path up over West Pass was easy compared to the climb to Carson Pass and was used by thousands of wagons from 1848 to 1863. The Carson Trail was a straightforward push to Placerville and the heart of the gold country and was a main route for emigrants for many years. A better route variation was finally blasted out of the face of the cliffs at Carson Spur in 1863 by the Amador and Nevada Wagon Road—a toll road around Carson Spur. Over time the Carson Trail developed many branches and toll roads for freight wagons, emigrants and miners going both ways over the Sierra.

One of the major drawbacks of the Carson Trail was its elevation, with substantial sections of the trail over , where snow often covered it from late fall well into the spring season. The Placerville route (Johnson Cutoff) became the preferred trail, as it was lower and extensively improved. It could be used much of the winter season for at least horse travel.

The present highway route—California State Route 88 follows much of the original Carson Trail route from the California/Nevada border for 38 miles to Mormon-Emigrant Trail/Iron Mountain Road, which goes to Pollock Pines, California, and from there on to Placerville, California. The current road avoids the highest section over West Pass by crossing the Carson Spur. Kirkwood Mountain Resort and ski area now occupies some of the higher parts of the original Carson Trail.

=====Johnson Cutoff=====
The Johnson Cutoff (1850–51) road (also called Placerville Route, Lake Tahoe Route and Day Route) from Carson City, Nevada, to Placerville (then called Hangtown) used part of the Carson Trail to about present day Carson City. This cutoff was developed by John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville in about 1850–51. Leaving the future site of Carson City, the cutoff passed over the Carson Range by following Cold Creek (via Kings Canyon Road) and passing over Spooner Summit (now used by U.S. Route 50). Once near Lake Tahoe it was forced to climb some further steep ridges by rocky spurs jutting into the lake and swampy ground (modern U.S. Highway 50 corrects both these problems). After getting to the southern end of the lake, the trail veered west near Echo Lake and climbing steeply made it over the Sierra on Echo Summit (Johnson&#x27;s Pass). The steep descent from Johnson&#x27;s Pass brought the trail down to Slippery Ford on the South Fork American River. From there, Johnson&#x27;s Cutoff headed westward following the river from Strawberry to today&#x27;s Kyburz, California, before crossing to its north side and ascending about to Peavine Ridge and following its crest to get around a rocky stretch of the river. After descending Peavine ridge the trail forded the South Fork of the American River near Pacific House. From about today&#x27;s Pollock Pines, California it followed the ridge line on the south side of the river to Placerville. Johnson&#x27;s route became a serious competitor as the main route over the Sierra. This route, with considerable up grades and modifications, eventually became one of the main all-season routes over the Sierra since it could be kept open at least intermittently in the winter.

In 1855, the California Legislature passed &quot;An Act to Construct a Wagon Road over the Sierra Nevada Mountains&quot; and appropriated $100,005 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) for its implementation. Sherman Day, a part-time California State Senator was appointed to survey the possible routes. After extensive searches, he recommended the Placerville route (Johnson&#x27;s Cutoff) as the best prospect and surveyed an improved route. The California Supreme Court ruled in 1856 that the law was unconstitutional since it violated the state Constitution&#x27;s allowable $300,000 (~$ in ) debt limit without public vote. Discouraged but not defeated, road proponents got El-Dorado, Sacramento and Yolo counties to kick in $50,000 for road construction. Contracts were let and they got a new bridge across the South Fork American River ($11,300); a new sidehill road along Peavine ridge that was only above the river and avoided the sharp ascents and descents there and extensive work on a new road up to Johnson&#x27;s Summit (Echo Summit) and another less precipitous road down to Lake Valley. This was the first route over the Sierra on which extensive, public financed, improvements were made. The new route was christened the Day Route. Winter and its attendant runoffs raised havoc with the road and in spring 1860, when the mobs were trying to get to Virginia City, Nevada, and the new Comstock Lode strike, it was reported as a barely passably trail in places (April 1860). To get supplies to Virginia City, Nevada, and the Comstock area after 1860, the road was extensively improved as a toll road to the mines in Virginia City, Nevada. It is now followed roughly by U.S. Highway 50.

In 1860–61, the Pony Express used Daggetts Pass and Johnson&#x27;s cutoff route to deliver their mail—even in the winter.

=====Luther Pass Trail=====
The Luther Pass Trail (1854) was established to connect the Carson River Canyon road with the Johnson Cutoff (Placerville Road or Lake Tahoe Road). Luther Pass (present CA SR 89) joined the older emigrant route northeast of Carson Pass through Carson River Canyon rather than following the trails along Lake Tahoe. Going East after descending from Echo Summit and getting to the south end of Lake Valley, it headed southeast over Luther Pass into Hope Valley where it connected with the main Carson Trail through Carson River canyon to get over the Carson Range.

=====Daggett Pass=====
Branching off the Johnson&#x27;s Cutoff (Placerville Road) was about Daggett Pass toll road (Georgetown Pack Trail) (est. abt 1850). This route was developed as a toll road to get across the Carson Range of mountains. Going east it leaves The Placerville Route near what is now Stateline, Nevada (near South Lake Tahoe) and progresses up Kingsbury Grade to Daggett Pass and on down the Kingsbury Grade to Carson Valley. After 1859 and the discovery of gold and silver in the Comstock Lode, this road was extensively improved and used by teamsters going to Virginia City, Nevada, as it cut about off the usual road through Carson River Canyon. Today Nevada State Route 207 closely approximates this road.

=====Grizzly Flat Road=====
The Grizzly Flat Road (1852) to Grizzly Flat &amp; Placerville was an extension of the Carson trail that went down the middle fork of the Consumes River to what was then a busy gold diggings at Grizzly Flat—located about east of Placerville.

=====Volcano Road=====
The Volcano Road (1852) off the Carson Trail was made in 1852 when Amador County and Stockton merchants paid a contractor to construct a road from Corral Flat on what is now the Carson Trail (California State Route 88) to Volcano, California. Today the cutoff is approximately followed off SR 88 by the Fiddletown Silver Lake Road, Shake Ridge Road And Ram&#x27;s Horn Grade.

=====Big Tree Road=====
Big Tree Road &amp; Ebbetts Pass Road (est. about 1851–1862) from the gold mining towns of Murphys, California &amp; Stockton, California to gold and silver mining towns/mines near Markleeville in eastern California and western Nevada. It approximates the present California State Route 4 route over Ebbetts Pass. Descriptions of the pass match those used by Jedediah Smith in the late spring of 1827 when leaving California, as well as the pass used by John Bidwell and the Bartleson–Bidwell Party on their emigration to California in 1841.

Originally a free pack trail route when first used in about 1851 by &quot;Major&quot; John Ebbetts, it was improved to a wagon road and became a toll road to silver mining towns in eastern California and western Nevada from 1864 through 1910, and then a free county road in 1911. It was used by very few emigrants to California.

The road reverted to a free county road in 1911 and was accepted into the California State Highway system in 1926 as California State Route 4. It was not until the early 1950s that the road over Monitor Pass to U.S. Route 395 was completed, connecting the eastern terminus of State Route 4 to U.S. Route 395 via California State Route 89 near the community of Topaz, California. Today&#x27;s Ebbetts Pass National Scenic Byway is a very scenic drive but one of the least traveled highways across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It is anchored at either end by two state parks—Calaveras Big Trees State Park and Grover Hot Springs State Park. It passes through the Stanislaus and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forests. Today&#x27;s Ebbetts Pass road, SR 4, has an extensive section of highway that is less than two lanes wide with no dividing line. It also has some very steep sections, particularly on the eastern Sierra slopes, with several sharp hairpin corners.

Both the &quot;Carson River&quot; and &quot;Truckee River&quot; trails eventually ended up at Sutter&#x27;s Fort in Sacramento, California. In 1848 most emigrants developed and used this route. In 1849 about one-third of all emigrants used the Carson Trail with later years many more using it. Starting in 1848, many left the main trail to stay in a mining district(s) or town(s) that developed along or off the trail(s).

=====Sonora Road=====
In 1852, the Sonora Road was opened from the Carson Trail to Sonora, California, by the Clark-Skidmore Company. From the Humboldt Sink it crossed Forty Mile Desert to the Carson River and then went almost due south to the Walker River, which it followed to the Sierra before making the very steep (about 26 degrees in parts) and rugged ascent to Sonora Pass.

From there the road drops down twisting forested mountain ridges to Sonora. This was the highest road developed across the Sierra—and still a very scenic drive. (modern Tioga Pass out of Yosemite National Park is slightly higher) California State Route 108 between Sonora and U.S. Highway 395 roughly approximates the route of the Sonora Road over the Sierra. This route was little used after about 1854.

====Applegate–Lassen Cutoff====
The Applegate–Lassen Cutoff or Applegate Trail (est. 1846–48) left the California Trail at Lassen Meadows, near the present-day Rye Patch Reservoir on the Humboldt River in Nevada. The trail headed northwest until it could pass north of the worst of the California Sierra Nevada mountains. The trail passed through Rabbithole Springs, crossed the Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon before finally (after nearly of desert travel) arriving at Surprise Valley and climbing steeply to go over Fandango Pass. From there, travelers faced a descent down a very steep hill to Fandango Valley on the shores of Goose Lake on the Oregon-California border. Just south of Goose Lake the combined Oregon-California trail split at Davis Creek. The Applegate Trail branch proceeded northwest into southeastern Oregon along the Lost River before turning almost due north roughly along the route of today&#x27;s Interstate 5 to go the Willamette Valley in Oregon.

The California branch, the Lassen Cutoff (established in 1848 with a help from eager Oregon gold seekers), proceeded southwest through the Devil&#x27;s Garden along the Pit River and passed east of Lassen Peak until it eventually swung west at present day Lake Almanor (reservoir) and arrived at Lassen&#x27;s rancho near the Sacramento River. From there it followed the river south in the Central Valley (California) about to Sutter&#x27;s Fort and the gold fields. This road was so rough that today in many places it can only be traveled by the occasional forest trail and hiking paths.

The Applegate–Lassen Cutoff was almost further than other routes and took roughly fifteen to thirty days of additional travel to get to Sutter&#x27;s Fort, which was unknown to nearly all who initially took it. It avoided Forty Mile Desert and many of the high passes and difficult climbs of other routes, but it introduced some difficult desert crossings and had very limited grass and water. For most it was a very bad choice of routes. Much of the traffic on this alternate route in the early days was due to confusion, as enough travelers turned off on this route to make many of those following think wrongly that it was the main route. Most had dispensed with hiring guides who actually knew the trail by then and almost none had any written guides about the Applegate-Lassen Trail. Most did not realize for several days or even weeks they had made a wrong turn. It is estimated that in 1849 about 7,000 to 8,000 (about one-third of California trail travelers that year) inadvertently took this much longer trail and found that the earlier travelers and their animals had stripped the desert bare and set fires that had burned most available grass. There was almost no forage left for their animals, and they lost many hundreds of animals and suffered severe hardships and several deaths, as many ran out of supplies before rescue parties sent out from Sutter&#x27;s Fort could reach them. By 1853, other faster, easier, and shorter routes had been worked out, and traffic on the Applegate-Lassen cutoff declined to a trickle.

====Nobles Road====
In 1851, William Nobles surveyed a shorter variation of the Applegate–Lassen trail. It was developed to make it easier to get to Shasta, California (which paid him $2,000) in the Central Valley and was first used in 1852. The route, called Noble&#x27;s Road, left the main trail near Lasson&#x27;s meadow (now Rye Patch Reservoir) in Nevada, and bypassed most of the large Applegate-Lassen loop north almost to Goose Lake (Oregon-California) on the Oregon-California border. This reasonably easy wagon route followed the Applegate-Lassen Trail to the Boiling Spring at Black Rock in Black Rock Desert and then went almost due west from there to Shasta, California, in the Central Valley via Smoke Creek Desert to present-day Honey Lake and present-day Susanville before passing North of Mt. Lassen and on to Shasta (near present-day Redding). The route today can be approximated by taking Nevada State Route 49 (Jungo Road) from Winnemucca, Nevada, to Gerlach, Nevada, and from there to Susanville via Smoke Creek Road. From there, California State Route 44 through Lassen Volcanic National Park to Redding approximates the rest of the trail. It depended upon springs for water, as there were no dependable creeks along most of the route. East of Mt. Lassen, it used part of Lassen&#x27;s road in reverse over a distance of about . In that section of trail, a traveler going to Shasta City might travel north passing another traveler going south to Sutter&#x27;s Fort California.

In 1857, Congress appropriated $300,000 (~$ in ) for building a wagon road to California and to establish the Fort Kearny, South Pass and Honey Lake Wagon Road. Exactly why the road was to terminate at Honey Lake near Susanville is a legislative mystery, since very few went that way in 1857 or later. The road was built in response to pressure from California Congressmen who wanted a good road to California, preferably one that bypassed Forty Mile Desert. The first part of the route was surveyed by Frederick W. Lander working under William Magraw. In 1858, Lander guided several hundred workers who built the Landers Cutoff passing the Green River well north of the established ferries, over Thompson Pass into Star Valley Wyoming, and from there up Stump Creek and on to Fort Hall in Idaho. In 1860, Landers was instructed to find a new route north of the Humboldt. To help the emigrants leaving the main trail at Lassen&#x27;s meadow and going to Honey Lake, Lander had two large reservoir tanks built at Rabbit Hole and Antelope Springs. These reservoirs helped Nobles Road keep its status as an emigrant trail, but only the few emigrants interested in going to Northern California used it.

====California toll roads over the Sierra====
Initially, the trails across the Sierra were improved only enough to make them barely passable. The main initial attraction for improved toll roads across the Sierra was Virginia City, Nevada and the Comstock Lode strike in the Washoe district of Nevada in 1859. This strike rapidly developed after about 1860 when they found out how potentially massive the gold and silver deposits there were. A good, easily traversed road was needed to haul in miners, other workers, supplies, etc., and road improvements and maintenance could be financed by the road tolls. The Comstock Lode mines would require millions of dollars of investment to buy and ship in thousands of tons of mining supplies, food and firewood to supply the mines. Almost no cities existed in Nevada then, and Virginia City would be Nevada&#x27;s first major city. In addition, until the mills could be built, high grade ore was shipped to California for processing. The gold and silver ore there required developing a new massive industrial scale mining operation by multiple mines to get it out. New techniques would have to be developed to get the silver out, the Washoe process. New techniques were required to support the mines, which were often in weak ground. The square-set timber process ultimately used millions of board feet of lumber. Millions of gallons of water per day had to be pumped out of the mines usually by massive steam powered Cornish pumps, which ultimately had over long pumping rods that weighed over and used over 33 cords of wood fuel per day, each. In addition, the mine hoists and up to 75 mills were all run with steam engines, all using copious amounts of wood. Winter heating consumed more thousands of cords of wood. All these thousands of cords of firewood had to be freighted in. The heavy firewood and timber needs of the &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;&#x27; strike lead to much of the Carson Range and part of the Sierra Nevada being extensively denuded of timber. As the mines developed they went into progressively hotter regions until they were mining in up to 130 degree Fahrenheit (55 degree Celsius) temperatures. To survive in these temperatures the miners used up tons of ice (frozen in the winter and hauled in) each day. The gold and silver found more than paid for the wages, development, lumbering and shipping costs. In the next twenty years, over $300,000,000 (in 1880 dollars) worth of gold (at about $20/oz.) and silver (at about $1.00/oz.) were extracted.

Starting in 1860, many emigrant trails over difficult terrain and streams were improved and replaced by toll roads and bridges built and financed by private entrepreneurs and some cities. Later, other strikes in western Nevada and eastern California would give impetus to new toll roads to a new mining town.

Initially, the two main toll roads over the Sierra that were improved and developed were the Henness Pass Route from Nevada City, California, to Virginia City, Nevada, and the Placerville Route, (also called Johnsons&#x27;s Cutoff and the Tahoe Wagon Road) from Placerville, California, to Lake Tahoe and over the Carson range to Virginia City. The Placerville route would be the first route that could be kept at least partially open even in winter. The Henness Pass route was partially built by a $25,000 grant from Marysville and Nevada City. The Placerville route was somewhat shorter at about and had the additional advantage that freight could be shipped to Folsom, California, about out of Sacramento on the Sacramento Valley Railroad—built in 1856. This freight could then be transferred onto wagons that had good roads to Placerville and later clear to Virginia City. In their heyday from about 1861–1866, these roads had major improvements made at many thousands of dollars per road and paid the salaries of a small army of employees that worked on building and maintaining different sections of the road and the service centers located roughly every ten miles. A typical wage then was from $1.00 to $2.00/day for laborers, teamsters etc., with higher wages when men were scarce. The miners in Virginia City were paid the very high wage of $4.00/day. A team could be hired for a few dollars/day. The storm-induced and spring runoff gullies and ruts in the roads would have to be filled in, culverts installed, streams and canyons bridged, gravel hauled in to fill the soft spots in the road, rough spots evened out and road cuts made in the side hills to get around the hills. The only tools available to build and maintain roads then were hand tools: picks, shovels, crow bars, hoes, axes, wheelbarrows, hand saws, etc. This was aided by judicious use of black powder to eliminate really bad spots. The only power available was human, ox or mule pulled plows, wagons and mule powered dump carts. The railroads would be built with essentially the same tools. Every spring, extensive repairs costing additional thousands would be needed to repair the ravages of winter and the gully washing spring thaws.

During summer daylight hours, the roads were often packed for miles in busy spots with heavily laden wagons headed east and west usually pulled by up to ten mules. Wagons headed west were mostly empty, but some carried the literally tons of silver mined in the Washoe district (Virginia City) back to San Francisco. Passing spots were located frequently along the roads to allow two way traffic. The roughly round trip over the Henness Pass road or the Placerville Route could be done by freight wagons in about 16–18 days.

Mail and passenger stages usually went at night to avoid most of the slower (≈3 mph) wagon traffic. As counted in 1862, the average number of passengers carried each day on the Placerville Route&#x27;s Pioneer Stage Company line with 12 coaches and 600 horses averaged about 37 passengers/day. Horses were changed at roughly every 10–20 mile intervals and the drivers often vied to make the fastest time. A typical stage trip took approximately 18 hours from Placerville to Virginia City with an 18-hour return. Holdups, stage wrecks and other accidents were an occasional occurrence on both routes. In 1864, stage receipts were estimated by newspapers of the time to be about $527,000 at $27.00 per passenger on the Placerville route. The Henness Pass road&#x27;s California Stage Company and Nevada Stage Line carried somewhat fewer passengers. Both stage coach routes together were estimated by newspapers of the day to have gross receipts, including mail subsidies, of over $1,000,000 total in 1864 (~$ in ). The typical freight charges were about $120.00 to $160.00/ton (6–8 cents/pound) with am additional $20.00 to $30.00 toll charges/wagon. A Central Pacific Railroad agent (J. R. Atkins) estimated, after counting all Placerville toll road traffic in August and September 1862, that the freight charges to Virginia City over the Placerville route would have been about $5,000,000, (~$ in ) which delivered roughly of freight in eight weeks. Similar amounts presumable were shipped over the Henness pass route. In a given month during the busy season, over 2,000 wagons (sometimes up to three wagons were pulled by one team) and over 10,000 draft animals (mostly mules) per month were counted on the Placerville road alone in 1862. The Placerville Route and Henness Pass route even had sprinkler wagons that wetted down the road during daylight hours about every three hours to minimize dust and wear and tear on the road. There were 93 hotels, stage relay stations and lodging stations located along the Placerville Route with similar stations along the Henness Pass route located at roughly intervals. The teamsters stayed at these locations at the end of each day&#x27;s travel. The Placerville Route tried to stay open in winter to at least horse traffic and was only closed temporarily by winter storms. The Pony Express used this route in the summer and winter of 1860–61. The net profit per year from these toll roads was probably over $100,000/yr in 1862 (~$ in ) and increasing every year.

Competition arrived in July 1864 when the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (DFDLWR) This route was opened over much of the route the new Central Pacific railroad would use over Donner Summit. This route followed much of the original Truckee Trail route with the major exception that its large work force could smooth and straighten the route and make major side hill cuts that built around many of the steep grades and over or through major obstacles. Below Dutch Flat where the original Truckee Trail diverged from modern roads to descend into a steep canyon and use the Bear River ridge to get around impassable terrain the Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (and the Central Pacific track) was cut around many of the sharp ridges that had prevented a wagon road there. Despite the Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road name, the railhead would not actually reach Dutch Flat (about east of Sacramento) until July 4, 1866, as it was built over difficult terrain and required very heavy construction to reach Dutch Flat. Their toll road was built with a reported $200,000 (1864 dollars) investment and involved about 350 men and many teams of animals working for over ten months. Initially, the road extended from the railhead (then Newcastle, about east of Sacramento) over Donner summit to Verdi, Nevada, where it joined the road developed by the Henness Pass road to Virginia City, Nevada. After it was opened, this route was advertised by the California Stage Company to reach Virginia City in three hours less time (about 17 hours) than the Sacramento-Placerville Route and have lower grades and wider roads, (), than the other routes. This new toll road was developed so the new railroad could earn money even as it was being built as well as supplying their own hefty transportation needs. As the railroad construction progressed over the Sierra, freight could be shipped to near the railhead then transferred to wagons that could use the new toll road to complete their journey. It slowly took over much of the shipping to Virginia City and the Washoe district as the railroad progressed over Donner Summit (December 1868) and into Truckee and beyond. Today&#x27;s Interstate 80 goes over much of the same route and is the main transportation artery over the Sierra in northern California.

Tolls existed on nearly all Sierra trail crossings as improvements were made; but most other roads after the two (later three) main toll roads were developed, were relatively lightly used. A typical toll from Sacramento to Virginia City Nevada was about $25.00 to $30.00 round trip for a freight wagon carrying at least up to of cargo with additional tolls possible for additional animals over six (usually $1.50/animal) and some additional bridge tolls were also needed. Some teams had up to ten animals pulling up to three wagons trailered behind each other. Some counties and cities did help build some roads but mainly granted franchises so toll road operators could build and maintain good roads and bridges with assurances of minimum competition and compensation. Some resented the toll charges, but the users of the road paid for the improvements and maintenance on the roads, and taxpayers of this era in general were very hesitant to pick up the very hefty cost of building and maintaining good &quot;free&quot; roads.

Nearly all of the heavy wagon freighting and stage use over the Sierra ceased after the completion of the Central Pacific and Virginia Truckee railroads in 1869. The ongoing massive needs for millions of board feet of Sierra timber and thousands of cords of firewood in the Comstock Lode mines and towns would be the single major exception, although they even built narrow gauge railroads to haul much of this. Stages and wagons were still needed and used for the many cities not serviced by the railroads and the stage and freight lines continued in business. The first &quot;highway&quot; established by the counties was the Placerville toll route that was bought by the counties and made a &quot;free&quot; (taxpayer financed) road in 1886. The first &quot;highway&quot; established by the state government was this same Placerville wagon road over the Sierra after it was bought by the state in 1896. This road eventually became U.S. Route 50.

Due to lack of use after 1869, most of the wagon roads across the Sierra were allowed to deteriorate until, by the early 20th century, many were again next to impassable to wagons. The railroad served nearly all trans-Sierra passenger and freight needs. The arrival of the automobile in the early 20th century revived the need for good Sierra roads. By 1910, only the Placerville route (now a state highway) was maintained well enough for car and truck traffic to get over the Sierra. The Truckee Trail that was modified and upgraded to the Dutch Flat and Donner Wagon Road over Donner summit had deteriorated so badly that the road had to be extensively rebuilt and relocated to become passable for cars or trucks. After extensive upgrades and modifications this road would become U.S. Route 40 and later Interstate 80.

====Other traffic====
Others besides emigrants were also using parts of the trail(s) for freighting, extensive livestock herding of cows, sheep and horses, stage lines, and briefly in 1860–61 the Pony Express. Traffic in the California-Nevada area was often two ways as the fabulously rich mines like the Comstock Lode (found in 1859) in Nevada and other gold and silver discoveries in eastern California, Nevada, Idaho and Montana needed supplies freighted out of California. The completion of the Panama Railroad in 1855 along with fast steamboats traveling to both the Pacific and Atlantic ports in Panama made shipping people and supplies from Europe and the east coast into California and from there to new gold and silver mining towns reasonably inexpensive. New ranches and settlements located along the trail(s) also needed supplies freighted in. Gold and silver discoveries in Colorado often had their supplies shipped in from the east coast and midwest along parts of the various emigrant trails. Steamboats delivered supplies to Missouri River ports from both sites in the eastern United States but also from Europe as New Orleans, Louisiana and others allowed cheap and reasonably fast ship connections to Europe. Before the railroads came in, horse, mule or oxen pulled freight wagons from either California or the midwest were the only way new supplies from the east, midwest and Europe could get to several states. Gold, silver, livestock etc. were shipped back to Europe and the east coast to pay for these supplies.

Toll bridges and ferries were active at nearly all previously dangerous river crossings as the trail became not only safer but quicker. Stage coaches by changing teams at newly established stage stations about every and traveling day and night, could make a transit from the Missouri River to California in 25 to 28 days. After 1861, telegraph relay stations and their crews joined these stage stations along much of the route. Forts and army patrols helped protect these various stations from Indian attacks throughout the U.S. Civil War period and later. Regular wagon trains that only had one team per wagon and stopped at night cut their transit time from about 160 days in 1849 to 120 days in 1860. The tolls on the various bridges, ferries and toll roads typically averaged about $30.00 per wagon by 1860. All these toll bridges, roads and ferries shortened the journey west by about 40 days and made it much safer as bad parts of the trail were improved and dangerous river crossings were done now by ferries and toll bridges that cost money but were much safer and faster. Nearly all improvements were financed by tolls on the various roads, bridges and ferries.

====The Central Pacific, Union Pacific, and Virginia and Truckee Railroads====
The ultimate competitor to the California Trail showed up in 1869 when the First transcontinental railroad was completed. The combined Central Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad carried traffic from the East into California, and the Virginia and Truckee Railroad carried traffic from Reno to Virginia City. The trip from Omaha, Nebraska, to California became faster, cheaper, and safer, with a typical trip taking only seven days and a $65 (economy) fare. Even before completion, sections of the railroad were used to haul freight and people around Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and California. The price of many goods imported from the east dropped by 20–50% as the much cheaper transportation costs were mostly passed on to the consumers. The California trail was used after 1869 by a few intrepid travelers, but it mostly reverted to local traffic traveling to towns or locations along the trail.

==Statistics==

===Immigrants===
Some of the trail statistics for the early years were recorded by the U.S. Army at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, from about 1849 to 1855. None of these original statistical records have been found, as the army lost them or destroyed them. Some diary references to these records and some partial written copies of the Army records as recorded in several diaries have survived. Emigration to California spiked considerably due to the 1849 gold rush. Following the discovery of gold, California remained the destination of choice for most emigrants on the trail up to 1860, with almost 200,000 people traveling there between 1849 and 1860.

Travel after 1860 is even less well known as the U.S. Civil War caused considerable disruptions on the trail. Many of the people on the trail in 1861–1863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail Historian Merrill J. Mattes has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table.

These estimates, however, may be low, since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census numbers show an increase of 200,000. This ignores most of California&#x27;s population increase from the excellent sea and rail connections across Panama that existed by then.

Mormon emigration records after 1860 are reasonably well known, as newspaper and other accounts in Salt Lake City give most of the names of emigrants that arrived each year from 1847 to 1868. Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and Montana also caused a considerable increase in people using the trail(s) often in directions different from the original trail users.

Though the numbers are significant in the context of the times, far more people chose to remain at home in the 31 states. Between 1840 and 1860, the population of the United States rose by 14 million, yet only about 300,000 decided to make the trip. Between 1860 and 1870 the U.S. population increased by seven million with about 350,000 of this increase being in the Western states. Many were discouraged by the cost, effort and danger of the trip. Western scout Kit Carson reputedly said, &quot;The cowards never started and the weak died on the way.&quot; According to several sources 3–10% of the immigrants are estimated to have perished on the way west.

===Western census data===
These census numbers show a 363,000 population increase in the western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is due to a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is due to emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is due to emigration by ship, as there were fast and reasonable low-cost transportation via east and west coast steam ships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trail(s) to get to their new homes in the 1860–1870 decade.

===Costs===
The cost of traveling over the California or Oregon trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone outside of family groups and were a distinct minority in the West for decades. The cheapest way to travel the trail was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon and usually make good money doing it. About 60–80% of the travelers were farmers, and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team and many of the necessary supplies, this lowered the cost of the trip to about per person for six months food and other items. Families often planned for a trip months in advance and made many of the extra clothing and other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between and per person. Some who traveled in grand style with several wagons and servants could spend much more.

As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about per wagon or about $10/person.

===Deaths===
The route West was arduous and filled with many dangers, but the number of deaths on the trail is not known with any precision, and there are only wildly varying estimates. The estimates are made even harder by the common practice then of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid them being dug up by animals or Indians. Graves were often put in the middle of a trail and then run over by their livestock to make them difficult to find. Diseases like cholera were the main killer of trail travelers with up to 3% (or more) of all travelers (6,000 to 12,000+ total) dying of cholera in the cholera years of 1849 to 1855. Indian attacks were probably the second leading cause of death with about 500 to 1,000 being killed from 1841 to 1870. Other common causes of death included: freezing to death (300–500), drowning in river crossings (200–500), getting run over by wagons (200–500), and accidental gun deaths (200–500).

A significant number of travelers were suffering from scurvy by the end of their trips. Their typical daily diet of flour, dried corn and salted pork/bacon for months on end had very few anti-scurvy ingredients. Scurvy is a nutritional deficiency disease that can lead to death if not treated. Treatment consists of a proper diet. A known scurvy prevention, as worked out by most navies in the 18th century, was found in a diet that contained dried and fresh fruit or vegetables (as finally discovered in 1932—vitamin C rich foods). The diet in the mining camps was also initially poor in fresh or dried vegetables and fruit, which indirectly led to early deaths of many Argonauts. Some believe scurvy deaths from poor nutrition may have rivaled cholera as a killer, with most deaths occurring after they reached California. In a few years, as the gold strikes continued, nearly any and all foods were grown or imported into California—for sale if you had the gold. How to prevent and treat scurvy was common knowledge in some circles but far from universally known, taught or appreciated as the hazard it was. The Chinese Argonauts with their insistence on many more vegetables in their diet fared much better.

Accidents with animals serious enough to cause death include kicks by animals (getting hit by a shod hoof could be deadly), falling off the horse or mule and hitting your head, getting hit by a falling horse or mule, stampedes, bear attacks, and wounded animal attacks. These probably numbered from 100 to 200 or more deaths along the trail from 1847 to 1869. Because of the large number of animals on the trail, and their close interaction with people, accidents with animals that only resulted in minor injury were much more common.

Miscellaneous deaths included deaths by homicides, lightning strikes, childbirths, snake bites, flash floods, falling trees, and wagon wrecks. These probably numbered from 200 to 500 deaths or more along the trail.

According to an evaluation by Trail Authority John Unruh, a 4% death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail while making the trip.

==Legacy==
One of the main enduring legacies of the Oregon and California Trails is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast. Without the many thousands of United States settlers in Oregon and California with their &quot;boots on the ground&quot; and more thousands on their way each year, it is highly unlikely that this would have occurred. Surprising to some, the Oregon and California Trails were both established as known emigrant routes in 1841 by the same emigrant party. In 1841 the Bartleson–Bidwell Party group set out for California, but about half the party left the original group at Soda Springs, Idaho, and proceeded to the Willamette Valley in Oregon and the other half proceeded on to California. During pre-American Civil War &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; skirmishes between Kansas and Missouri raiders, the jumping off points for westward-bound wagon trains shifted northward towards Omaha, Nebraska. The trail branch John Fremont followed from Westport Landing to the Wakarusa Valley south of Lawrence, Kansas, became regionally known as the California Road.

Part of the same general route of the trail across Nevada was used for the Central Pacific portion of the first transcontinental railroad. In the 20th century, the route was used for modern highways, in particular U.S. Highway 40 and later Interstate 80. Ruts from the wagon wheels and names of emigrants, written with axle grease on rocks, can still be seen in the City of Rocks National Reserve in southern Idaho.

==Notes==
The California U.S. Census of 1850 showed 92,597 residents. To this should be added residents from San Francisco, (the largest city in the state) Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties whose censuses were burned up or lost and not included in the totals. Newspaper accounts in 1850 (&quot;Alta Californian&quot;) gives the population of San Francisco at 21,000; The special California state Census of 1852 finds 6,158 residents of Santa Clara county and 2,786 residents of Contra Costa County. The corrected California U.S. 1850 Census is over 120,000. See: U.S. Seventh Census 1850: California

* 1) Cholera—Cholera deaths includes deaths by other &#x27;diseases&#x27; of the day like old age, smallpox, typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia, consumption (tuberculosis), measles, yellow fever, dysentery, whooping cough, scarlet fever, malaria, mumps etc. The trail people were already exposed to these diseases before they left and would have in all likelihood have caught them anyway and are not unique hazards of the trail. There was no effective treatment for many of these diseases then (the germ theory of disease was just gaining acceptance) and little that any doctor of this era could do for those that got them except let them recover on their own or die.
* 2) Indian attacks—Indian attacks increased significantly after 1860 when most of the army troops were withdrawn and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt lead to most travelers taking the Central Nevada Route across Nevada.
* 3) Freezing—For examples of freezing deaths see: Donner Party and Willie and Martin handcart companies for three major winter disasters.
* 4) Run overs—Run overs by wagons were a major cause of death, despite the wagons only averaging 2–3 miles per hour. The wagons couldn&#x27;t easily be stopped and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving—not always successfully. Another hazard was getting pulled under the wagon wheels by loose clothing getting caught in the wheels. The iron wheels on the wagons were not very forgiving.
* 5) Drownings—Drownings at river crossings probably peaked in 1849 and 1850 when young, impatient men were the predominant population on the trail. Later more family groups started traveling as well as many more ferries and bridges being put in—fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era.
* 6) Shooting deaths—Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary as the perceived Indian threat faded and hunting opportunities receded.
* 7) Scurvy deaths—Scurvy, as such, was not often listed as a cause of death, but reading the reason they died leads to the conclusion that scurvy was probably the major cause of death—particularly in the last month on the trail.
* 8) Accidents with animals serious enough to cause death were almost inevitable given the number of people and animals involved. There were probably over three animals on the trails to each traveler.
* 9) Miscellaneous deaths—Miscellaneous deaths is a large catch-all for other deaths on the trail and may underestimate the true number.

She received numerous accolades becoming one of the few actors to have achieved the Triple Crown of Acting winning an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and two Tony Awards. She has also received a British Academy Film Award and a Golden Globe Award, as well as a nomination for a Grammy Award.

Stapleton started her career in theatre making her Broadway debut in &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; (1946). She went on to receive two Tony Awards for Best Featured Actress in a Play for &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1951) and for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot; (1971). She was Tony-nominated for her roles in &quot;The Cold Wind And The Warm&quot; (1959), &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1960), &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1981). 

For her portrayal of Emma Goldman in the historical epic film &quot;Reds&quot; (1981) she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was also Oscar-nominated for her roles in &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958), &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), and &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978).

Stryker&quot; (1989), &quot;Miss Rose White&quot; (1992), and &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; (1995). She received a Grammy Award nomination for narrating &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in 1975. For her life achievement she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.

==Early life==
Stapleton was born in Troy, New York, the daughter of John P. Stapleton and Irene (née Walsh), and grew up in a strict Irish American Catholic family. Her father was an alcoholic and her parents separated during her childhood.

==Career==

Stapleton moved to New York City at the age of 18, and worked as a salesgirl, hotel clerk, and modeled to pay the bills, including for artist Raphael Soyer. She once said that it was her infatuation with the handsome Hollywood actor Joel McCrea which led her into acting. She made her Broadway debut in the production featuring Burgess Meredith of &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; in 1946. That same year, she played the role of &quot;Iras&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; in a touring production by actress and producer Katharine Cornell. Stepping in because Anna Magnani refused the role due to her limited English, Stapleton won a Tony Award for her role in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; in 1951 (Magnani&#x27;s English improved, however, and she was able to play the role in the film version, winning an Oscar). 

Stapleton played in other Williams&#x27; productions, including &quot;Twenty-Seven Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; and &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; (and its film adaptation, &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot;, co-starring her friend Marlon Brando), as well as in &quot;The Cold Wind and the Warm&quot; (Tony nomination, 1959) and Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1960), for which she received another Tony Award nomination. She was nominated for a Tony Award for Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; in 1968 and won a second Tony Award for Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot;, which was written especially for her, in 1971. Later Broadway roles included a Tony-nominated turn as &quot;Birdie&quot; in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, opposite Elizabeth Taylor, and as a replacement for Jessica Tandy in &quot;The Gin Game&quot;. 

Stapleton&#x27;s film career, though limited, brought her immediate success, with her debut in &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958) earning nominations for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe Award. She appeared in the 1963 film version of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, in the role of Mama Mae Peterson, with Dick Van Dyke, Janet Leigh, Paul Lynde, and Ann-Margret. Stapleton played the role of Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s mother, even though she was only five months and 22 days older than Van Dyke. She was nominated again for an Oscar for &quot;Airport&quot; (Golden Globe Award nomination, 1970) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Interiors&quot; (Golden Globe Award nomination, 1978). She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), directed by Warren Beatty, in which she portrayed the Lithuanian-born anarchist, Emma Goldman. In her acceptance speech, she stated, &quot;I would like to thank everyone I&#x27;ve ever met in my entire life.&quot; Her later appearances included &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), and its sequel &quot;&quot; (1988). 

Stapleton won a 1968 Emmy Award for her performance in &quot;Among the Paths of Eden&quot; and was nominated for six more, for &quot;Avonlea&quot; (1996), &quot;Miss Rose White&quot; (1992), &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; (1989), the television version of &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1959), &quot;Queen of the Stardust Ballroom&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Gathering&quot; (1977), and &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; (1959). She also appeared opposite Laurence Olivier and Natalie Wood in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1976).

She was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981. She was an alumna of the famous Actors Studio in New York City, led by Lee Strasberg, where she became friends with Marilyn Monroe, who was only one year younger than Stapleton. She was impressed with Monroe&#x27;s talent, and always thought it was a shame that Monroe was rarely allowed to play roles beyond the ditzy blonde. By comparison, Stapleton thought herself lucky: &quot;I never had that problem. People looked at me on stage and said, &#x27;Jesus, that broad better be able to act.&#x27;&quot; One of the most famously remembered scenes at the studio was when Stapleton and Monroe acted in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; together.

Despite her association with Strasberg, Stapleton cited Mira Rostova as her most influential acting teacher. She appeared with Rostova and another of Rostova&#x27;s pupils, Montgomery Clift, Off-Broadway in &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; (1954). Additionally, in his book &quot;Sanford Meisner on Acting&quot;, Meisner cites Stapleton as being &quot;a wonderful actress.&quot; The pair starred together on Broadway in &quot;The Cold Wind and the Warm&quot;.

She was nominated for a 1975 Grammy Award for the spoken word recording of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

She hosted the 19th episode of Season 4 of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1979.

==Personal life and death==
Stapleton&#x27;s first husband was Max Allentuck, general manager to the producer Kermit Bloomgarden, and her second was playwright David Rayfiel, from whom she divorced in 1966. She had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Katherine, by her first husband. Her daughter, Katherine Allentuck, played a single movie role, that of &quot;Aggie&quot; in &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (Stapleton herself also had a minor, uncredited role in the film as the protagonist&#x27;s mother, though only her voice is heard; she does not appear on camera). Her son, Daniel Allentuck, is a documentary filmmaker. 

Stapleton suffered from anxiety and alcoholism for many years, and once told an interviewer, &quot;The curtain came down, and I went into the vodka.&quot; She also said that her unhappy childhood contributed to her insecurities, which included a fear of flying, airplanes, and elevators. A lifelong heavy smoker, Stapleton died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2006 at her home in Lenox, Massachusetts.

In 1981 Hudson Valley Community College in Stapleton&#x27;s childhood city of Troy, New York, dedicated a theater in her name.

<text>Raffi Cavoukian (, born July 8, 1948), known professionally by the mononym Raffi, is an Armenian-Canadian singer-lyricist and author born in Egypt best known for his children&#x27;s music. In 1992, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called him &quot;the most popular children&#x27;s singer in the English-speaking world&quot;. He developed his career as a &quot;global troubadour&quot; to become a music producer, author, entrepreneur, and founder of the Raffi Foundation for Child Honouring, an initiative focused on promoting children&#x27;s rights and well-being. He has also been involved in advocacy for environmental and social causes, often addressing issues like commercial exploitation of children and climate change through his music and public appearances.

==Early life==
Raffi was born in Cairo, Egypt, to Armenian Christian parents who fled Turkey during the Armenian genocide. His mother named him after the Armenian novelist Raffi. He was exposed to music at a young age, as his mother sang to him and his father sang and played accordion. In a 2024 interview, he noted that &quot;In my early childhood, growing up in a fairly authoritarian family, my parents loved me greatly. But it was at times a coercive love, not exactly a respectful love&quot;. The family left Egypt in 1952, living in Jerusalem and Syria before immigrating to Canada in 1958, eventually settling in Toronto, Ontario. 

His father, Arto Cavoukian, was a well-known portrait photographer with a studio on Bloor Street in Toronto. His older brother, Onnig Cavoukian, known as Cavouk, is also a famous portrait photographer. His younger sister is Ann Cavoukian, Ontario&#x27;s former Information and Privacy Commissioner. His parents died within twelve hours of each other, his mother dying first of abdominal cancer. He visited Soviet Armenia once in 1972.

==Career==

===Children&#x27;s entertainer===
In the early 1970s, Raffi frequented a Toronto guitar store near Yonge and Wellesley called Millwheel, where he met other developing Canadian musicians such as David Wilcox and John Lacey. He befriended Lacey, a folk guitarist from Oakville, Ontario, who helped Raffi improve his finger picking. Raffi continued playing folk guitar in coffee houses in Toronto and Montréal before hitchhiking to Vancouver in 1972 to find &quot;fame and fortune.&quot;

His first performance for children was in 1974, at a nursery school run by his mother-in-law. His first album, &quot;Singable Songs for the Very Young&quot;, was produced in his friend&#x27;s basement and released in 1976. The album was influenced by three educators, including his then-wife.

Most of Raffi&#x27;s children&#x27;s albums include small, simple, folk instrumentations featuring Raffi&#x27;s vocal and guitar work. Early works included contributions from Toronto-area folk musicians, including Ken Whiteley, The Honolulu Heartbreakers, and Bruce Cockburn. Raffi also incorporated many world music sounds into his records, including &quot;Sambalele&quot; (More Singable Songs, 1977) and &quot;Anansi&quot; (The Corner Grocery Store, 1979). Some of Raffi&#x27;s best-known children&#x27;s songs are &quot;Bananaphone&quot;, &quot;All I Really Need&quot;, and &quot;Down by the Bay&quot;.

In 1979, he wrote &quot;Baby Beluga&quot;, possibly his most famous song, after meeting a beluga whale named Kavna at the Vancouver Aquarium.

In 1989, his album &quot;Raffi In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band&quot; was listed on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart. He took a break from music from 1989 to 1990. 

In 1999, he released his autobiography, &quot;The Life of a Children’s Troubadour&quot;.

After a seven-year gap in publishing, Raffi released an album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Play&quot;, in 2002. Between 2003 and 2013, he took a hiatus from touring.

He is currently the president of Troubadour Music Inc., a triple-bottom-line company he founded to produce and promote his work. He released recordings for a number of other artists, including Caitlin Hanford and Chris Whiteley.

As of 2017, Raffi continues to perform and appears occasionally across Canada and the United States. His most recent album is &quot;Penny Penguin&quot;, a collaboration album with Canadian trio The Good Lovelies which was released in 2024.

===Advocacy===
Raffi&#x27;s recent musical work focuses on social and environmental causes and appeals to the generation who grew up with his children&#x27;s music (&quot;Beluga Grads&quot;) to effect change in the world. He also promotes those causes through his books, academic lectures and as a speaker. 

Raffi has been involved with environmental advocacy since 1989, releasing a music album for adults about climate change, &quot;Evergreen, Everblue&quot;, the following year. 

In 2004, he released &quot;Salaam Shalom,&quot; a song calling for the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

In 2007, Raffi wrote, recorded and produced the single &quot;Cool It&quot;, a rockabilly &quot;call to action&quot; on global warming with Dr. David Suzuki in the chorus. &quot;Cool It&quot; was the theme song for Dr. Suzuki&#x27;s recent Canadian tour to promote action on climate change. In February 2016, Raffi released the song &quot;Wave of Democracy&quot; in support of American Senator Bernie Sanders run to be the Democratic nominee for US Presidency. In September 2019 he released song &quot;Young People Marching&quot;, which was written for Greta Thunberg. 

In August 2020, Raffi released a song titled &quot;For All You Do,&quot; featuring Lindsay Munroe and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The song honored frontline and essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proceeds from downloads and streams were donated to Direct Relief to support healthcare workers globally.

Raffi is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

===Child Honouring===
In 1997, Raffi developed the idea of &quot;Child Honoring,&quot; which he described in 2021 as &quot;a vision of an extraordinary social-change revolution with the universal human at its heart, and that universal human is the human child&quot;. In 2006, he described the Child Honouring ethic is described as a &quot;vision, an organizing principle, and a way of life—a revolution in values that calls for a profound redesign of every sphere of society.&quot; His &quot;Covenant for Honouring Children&quot; outlines the principles of this philosophy.

In 2006, with Dr. Sharna Olfman, he co-edited an anthology, &quot;Child Honouring: How to Turn This World Around&quot;, which introduces Child Honouring as a philosophy for restoring communities and ecosystems. It contains chapters by Penelope Leach, Fritjof Capra, David Korten, Riane Eisler, Mary Gordon, Graça Machel, Joel Bakan, Matthew Fox, Barbara Kingsolver, Jean-Daniel Ó Donncada, and others. The book&#x27;s foreword is by the 14th Dalai Lama. The musical album &quot;Resisto Dancing: Songs of Compassionate Revolution&quot; was released as a tie-in for the book.

In a 2006 speech, Iona Campagnolo, Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, referred to Child Honouring as a &quot;vast change in the human paradigm.&quot;

Raffi advocates for a child&#x27;s right to live free of commercial exploitation and he has consistently refused all commercial endorsement offers. Raffi&#x27;s company has never directly advertised nor marketed to children. In 2005, he sent an open letter to Ted Rogers of Rogers Wireless, urging them to stop marketing cell phones to children. He also turned down a film proposal for &quot;Baby Beluga&quot; because of the nature of the funding, which was based on exploitative advertising and marketing.

Raffi has been hailed for his work as &quot;Canada&#x27;s all time children&#x27;s champion&quot;.

In October 2006, Raffi was presented with the Fred Rogers Integrity Award by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood at the Judge Baker Children&#x27;s Center in Boston, for his consistent refusal to use his music in endorsements that market products directly to children.

In 2012, after learning details surrounding the online bullying, exploitation and ultimate suicide of teenager Amanda Todd, Raffi and his Raffi Foundation for Child Honouring co-founded the Red Hood Project with business owner, former Crown prosecutor, community and arts philanthropist and advocate Sandy Garossino and design professional, writer, educator and community activist Mark Busse. Red Hood Project is a movement for consumer protection for children online that launched in November 2012.

In June 2013, Raffi published the book &quot;Lightweb Darkweb: Three Reasons to Reform Social Media Before it Re-forms Us&quot;, which examines both the benefits and the dangers present on the internet and in social media.

== Personal life ==
Raffi was previously married to a kindergarten teacher. He became a vegetarian in 1980.

He owned a home on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia from 2008 until 2024, when he put the property on the market. He has been an outspoken critic of American President Donald Trump, especially regarding the effects of his policies on children and youth.

<text>The Orange Coast is the string of cities and neighborhoods fronting the Pacific Coast in Orange County, California. From northwest to southeast, these cities are Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente. There are also two small unincorporated areas, a portion of Crystal Cove State Park between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach and Emerald Bay, a gated community located between two neighborhoods of Laguna Beach.

Specific neighborhoods associated with the &quot;Orange Coast&quot; moniker include Surfside (Seal Beach), Sunset Beach (Huntington Beach), Balboa Island (Newport Beach), Balboa Peninsula (Newport Beach), Corona del Mar (Newport Beach), Newport Coast (Newport Beach), South Laguna (Laguna Beach), Monarch Beach (Dana Point) and Capistrano Beach (Dana Point). Seal Beach and Huntington beach are considered to belong to North Orange County, while Newport Beach and the cities to its south are considered part of South Orange County.

The term South Coast is often used synonymously for the coastal communities south of Long Beach (although there exist many other definitions and common uses of South Coast). Many local businesses and institutions have adopted these names, such as Orange Coast College, the &quot;Orange Coast Daily Pilot&quot;, South Coast Repertory and South Coast Plaza (all based in Costa Mesa). The term &quot;beach cities&quot; is also used.

<text>Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro (21 March 1846 – 23 January 1905; spelled Raphael Bordallo Pinheiro in older Portuguese orthography) was a Portuguese artist known for his illustration, caricatures, sculpture, and ceramics designs. Bordalo Pinheiro created the popular cartoon character Zé Povinho (1875) and is considered the first Portuguese comics creator.

== Life ==

Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro was a disciple of his father, the painter Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro. His mother was Donna Maria Augusta do Ó Carvalho Prostes and his brother the painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro. 

He started publishing illustrations and political caricatures in humoristic magazines such as &quot;A Berlinda&quot; and &quot;O Calcanhar de Aquiles&quot; (the first satirical cartoon pamphlet in Portugal), frequently demonstrating a sarcastic humour with a political or social message.

In 1875, he travelled to Brazil to work as an illustrator and cartoonist for the publication &quot;Mosquito&quot; (and later, another publication called &quot;O Besouro&quot;), which was also employing the Italian/Brazilian illustrator Angelo Agostini, until then the unrivaled cartooning authority of Brazil. Pinheiro eventually became editor of other humorous, politically critical magazines. His fame as a caricaturist led the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; to become one of his collaborators.

He married Elvira Ferreira de Almeida in 1866, and the following year, his son Manuel Gustavo Bordalo Pinheiro was born.

In 1881, he published the illustrated reportage &quot;No Lazareto de Lisboa&quot; (&quot;The Lazaretto of Lisbon&quot;) that included personal thoughts and anecdotes (not unlike a Joe Sacco or Guy Delisle chronicle), and is considered an early example of autobiographical comics.

Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro died on 23 January 1905 in Chiado, Lisbon. He had a Catholic funeral, which was attended by several dozen people, including prominent politicians.

== &quot;Zé Povinho&quot; and comics ==

In 1875, Bordalo Pinheiro created the cartoon character Zé Povinho (literal translation: &quot;Joe Little People&quot;), a Portuguese everyman, portrayed as a poor peasant. He became first a symbol of the Portuguese farming poor, and eventually into the unofficial personification of Portugal.

In &quot;Zé Povinho&quot;, as in his other works, Bordalo Pinheiro&#x27;s drawing style was innovative and influential, making extensive use of onomatopoeia, graphical signs (such as those used to represent movement), strong images (the &quot;manguito&quot;), and his unique style of mixing punctuation marks, such as brackets, with drawing.

== Pottery ==

In 1885, he founded a ceramics factory in Caldas da Rainha, where he created many of the pottery designs for which this city is known. Raphael Bordallo Pinheiro was responsible for the technical and artistic aspects and his brother Feliciano Bordallo Pinheiro was in charge of the organizational aspects of the factory. He developed pieces of great technical, artistic and creative quality, painted tiles (azulejos), panels, pots, table centerpieces, vase busts, fountain basins, pitchers, plates, perfume bottles, vases and gigantic animals, etc., which in his hands quickly acquired an original character.

The factory is still in business. Bordalo Pinheiro was devoted to the production of ceramic pieces.

==Legacy==

The Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro Museum in Lisbon is dedicated to his life and works.

<text>Capitol Hill Arts Center, also known by its acronym CHAC (pronounced &quot;shack&quot;), was a performing arts center located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. CHAC operated two performance spaces in the building, most widely known for its theatre.

The center was founded in 2002 by Matthew Kwatinetz. CHAC was acknowledged as producing some of the most exciting theatre in Seattle: from Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; and Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; to the Pacific Northwest premiere of Dario Fo&#x27;s &quot;Archangels Don&#x27;t Play Pinball.&quot;

On the evening of Friday, March 24, 2006, CHAC was the venue of a zombie-themed rave called &quot;Better Off Undead&quot;. Attendees of an afterparty after that rave were the victims of the Capitol Hill massacre. By nearly all accounts, CHAC itself had excellent security at the rave, and the only connection of the massacre to the rave was that the perpetrator and the victims attended the rave, and that one of the victims invited the perpetrator to the afterparty.

CHAC closed in 2007.

<text>Monarch Beach is a small neighborhood in Orange County, California located within the city of Dana Point. It is primarily a residential community. Two luxury resorts, Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach Resort &amp; Club and the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, are located within the area. Monarch Beach is close to the city boundary between Dana Point and Laguna Niguel.

==History==
Monarch Beach is named after its most prominent geological feature, Monarch Bay, aptly named as its rolling hills of sagebrush and manzanita were once a breeding ground for the monarch butterfly. The butterflies were once seen there in large masses, but have disappeared from the area because their habitat has been replaced, almost entirely, by the large houses that can be found in the Monarch Beach neighborhood.

Monarch Beach became a subdivision of the incorporated city of Dana Point on January 1, 1989.

==Culture==
Monarch Beach has access to Salt Creek Beach and a picnic area. The neighborhood includes the Monarch Beach Resort &amp; Links Course – an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. It is also the home to the Dana Point Concours d&#x27;Elegance automotive charitable event held each year on the Monarch Beach Golf Links.

Peacemaker was ranked 9th as the &quot;Favorite Anime Series&quot; in the 26th annual Animage readers&#x27; poll. &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; comments that the &quot;drama of the series is paramount&quot; but its comedy is lame. &quot;Animefringe.com&quot; criticizes the protagonist of the series, labelling him as &quot;an annoying brat that cries and moans when he doesn&#x27;t get what he wants&quot;. &quot;Mania.com&quot;″s Chris Beveridge commends the anime for its slowly revealed &quot;supernatural elements&quot; as well as the simplicity and comical nature of Saizō the pig.

<doc id="768295" wikidata="Q8565258" url="?curid=768295" title="Foxwoods Resort Casino">
<text>Foxwoods Resort Casino is an integrated resort owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation on their reservation located in Ledyard, Connecticut. Including six casinos, the resort covers an area of . The casinos have more than 250 gaming tables for blackjack, craps, roulette, and poker, and have more than 5,500 slot machines. The casinos also have several restaurants, among them a Hard Rock Cafe. It has been developed since changes in state and federal laws in the late 20th century enabled Native American gaming on the sovereign reservations of federally recognized tribes. 

Foxwoods has two hotel towers, with a total of 2,228 hotel rooms; and an arcade for children and teens. The original tower, the Grand Pequot Tower, opened in 1997, while the second opened in 2008 as the MGM Grand. It was re-branded the Fox Tower in 2013. In 2015, a retail complex, known as Tanger Outlet Mall, opened between the two hotel towers with 85 stores featuring luxury goods.

==History==

The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe gained federal recognition and legal control of their reservation by an act of Congress in 1983, which overrode a veto by President Ronald Reagan. The tribe moved forward with development. They founded Foxwoods in 1986 as a high-stakes bingo hall on their reservation.

The tribe partnered with Lim Goh Tong, a Chinese Malaysian who founded the only legal casino in Malaysia, for financing to expand Foxwoods into a full gaming casino.

In 1992, the tribe added table games, followed by additional slot machines in 1993. G. Michael Brown became the chairman of the casino in 1993. In an agreement negotiated with the state of Connecticut, to gain their approval of the casino, the tribe agreed to pay 25 percent of the slot revenue to the state, a sum that amounted to almost $200 million per year . In the fiscal year ending June 2008, Foxwoods&#x27; 6,300 slots handled more than $9.1 billion. In January 2012, the &quot;hold&quot; was $45 million. A poker room and a high-limit 30-table game area were added in 1995.

Because Foxwoods is located on sovereign Mashantucket Pequot land, it is not required to comply with state laws related to smoking. Constructed in 1996, the casino is not a smoke-free facility. Due to complaints in the early 21st century from patrons and employees, it has designated many common areas, such as hallways, walkways, hotel lobbies, retail stores, and most restaurants, as non-smoking areas. In addition, it has designated certain areas for smokers. The poker room is non-smoking, and separate table gaming and slot areas are designated as non-smoking.

In 1997, the associated deluxe Grand Pequot Tower was opened for business.

Foxwoods was once reported to be the world&#x27;s largest casino, though it was later surpassed by the Venetian Macau.

===Debt default===
For years after opening in 1992, Foxwoods had a monopoly on casino gambling in the region. It made billions of dollars in profits. Shortly before the market recession of 2008, Foxwoods borrowed heavily to finance a massive expansion to include new hotel and conference facilities. Starting in 2009, Foxwoods defaulted on debts totaling over two billion dollars. As a result, in 2014 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s lowered Foxwoods&#x27; credit rating. The Mashantucket Pequot, owners of Foxwoods, have applied for and received millions of dollars in federal grants.

==Design==
Over time, the casino management achieved full build-out of the resort by hiring several design and construction entities. The majority of the work from 1992 to 2001 was completed by Construction Managers CR Klewin aka Klewin Building Co. and the Architect of Record was JCJ Architecture (formerly Jeter, Cook &amp; Jepson) of Hartford, Connecticut. Planning and concept designs were by New England Design Inc. and Nick606 Inc. Later phases were completed by Shawmut Design &amp; Construction, Perini Building Co., AZ Corporation, and others, with design work by Steelman Partners, HKS, Inc., and others. The resort managers revamped the whole resort and casino, re-branding it as &quot;The Fox&quot;.

The resort&#x27;s appearance inspires frequent comparisons or references to it as the &quot;Emerald City&quot;, after the city seen in the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Gaming==

Games available at Foxwoods include:
* Traditional &quot;big table&quot; Baccarat (Punto Banco style) and &quot;Mini-Baccarat&quot;, where a dealer handles the cards. In both variants the casino banks the game.
* Bingo, with a bingo hall able to accommodate up to 5000 players.
* Blackjack with 6- or 8-deck shoes. A variant called Spanish 21 is also played. The casino offers a rare &quot;Dollar blackjack&quot; table (minimum bet is $1).
* Craps.
* Keno drawings.
* A money wheel in the Fox Tower
* Pai gow is offered in the Asian gaming section of the Rainmaker Casino.
* Sic Bo, an Asian game with three dice in a shaker, is also played in the Asian gaming section.
* Table variants of poker (played against the house) include Caribbean Stud Poker, Casino war, Crazy 4 poker, High Five poker, Let It Ride, Pai Gow Poker, Texas Hold &#x27;Em bonus, and Three card poker.
* Roulette: Almost all of the wheels are of the American variety (with two green spots, 0 and 00), although there are a few European-style wheels with only one zero.
* Slot machines: It has 3,500 slot machines.
* Stargazer Room: The VIP room. This section requires a minimum of 20,000,000 coins in your account.
* A race book facility with a cafe. Bets may be made on Jai-Alai. They may also be made on a total of more than 60 tracks (combined) for dog racing and horse racing. Races are projected on high digital screens.

===Poker (formerly WPT World Poker Room)===
The Poker Room (formerly known as the WPT-World Poker Tour World Poker Room until 2012) is located one floor below the Rainmaker Casino. Poker games of varying stakes are conducted here, including limit and no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em, limit and pot-limit Omaha hold &#x27;em (including hi/lo), and seven-card stud (high only and hi/lo).

The poker room was relocated and expanded in March 2006, increasing the number of tables from 76 to 114, making it the largest poker room outside California. It is the third-largest poker room in the world, after the Commerce Casino and the Bicycle Casino.

===Sporting events / entertainment===

Since 2014, three major mixed martial arts events have been held at Foxwoods: UFC Fight Night: Jacaré vs. Mousasi, World Series of Fighting 20: Branch vs. McElligott and, most recently World Series of Fighting 24: Fitch vs. Okami.

==Fox Tower==

Construction started in November 2005 on a $700 million expansion at Foxwoods. On April 25, 2006, Foxwoods announced that they would lease the MGM Grand brand name for the new building, and that MGM Mirage would be a partner in the expansion project. The expansion, entitled MGM Grand at Foxwoods, opened on May 17, 2008. It is a separate building from the main Foxwoods resort. A moving walkway and Tanger Outlets Foxwoods (built in 2015), now connect the two complexes. Amenities at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods included:
* 53 table games
* 1,400 slot machines
* 825 hotel rooms/suites
* 4,000 seat performing arts theater
* Four restaurants and four retail outlets

In late 2013, MGM Mirage split from Foxwoods. The tribe renamed the building The Fox Tower, part of a re-branding effort as they face new competition from other casinos in the region.

In 2015, Tanger Outlets Foxwoods opened within the complex, located between the two hotel towers. Constructed for $120 million, the 85-store mall features luxury brands.

==Unionization of employees==
Beginning with an employee-led website to gain support and share ideas of how to react to changes employees had been going through, a small base of employees approached several union organizations to explore unionizing of dealers at Foxwoods Resort Casino. After the dealer group decided on the United Auto Workers in June 2007, the UAW helped start collecting signatures from dealers in support of a union. The UAW announced in September 2007 that it had collected the requisite number of signatures needed to hold an election to determine whether table games and poker dealers desired union representation or not.

The Tribe challenged the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board for their on-reservation Native American enterprises. Following hearings and review of the petitions, the NLRB ruled in favor of the union and ordered a union election to be conducted. On November 24, 2007, employees voted to unionize: 60 percent were in favor and 40 percent were against. The Foxwoods dealers cast 1,289 ballots for the union, 852 against representation, with challenges to 36 additional ballots. Approximately 2,700 dealers and dual-rate dealers were eligible to vote in the election.

After the workers won the right to unionize, Foxwoods Casino appealed the election results, reasserting its jurisdictional challenge. In addition, it said that the NLRB had made mistakes in conducting the vote. It had printed the ballot only in English and provided notices explaining the election in only one form of the Chinese language, thereby disenfranchising workers who spoke other languages. Furthermore, it said that interactions between union officials and some voters were unlawful. An NLRB Administrative Law Judge ruled that the union and the board provided ample explanation of the election in a variety of languages. Foxwoods appealed the decision.

The Foxwoods dealers&#x27; union asked the state of Connecticut to improve the conditions of their workplace. Workers and union organizers pushed for legislation to ban smoking on the casino floors of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. The Mashantucket tribe opposed a complete ban on smoking; however, in May 2009 Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell signed an agreement with Foxwoods by which they would limit smoking areas in the casino.

On January 26, 2010, dealers at Foxwoods reached a labor contract with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. They are the largest group of union-represented dealers at any U.S. casino. On August 7, 2013, the union announced a tentative new contract that would give dealers retroactive and future raises, set stricter limits on second-hand smoke, and give dealers the right to decide how tips are distributed.

In April 2018, an additional 300 cleaning and maintenance workers voted to join the UAW.

<text>Broadcast engineering or radio engineering is the field of electrical engineering, and now to some extent computer engineering and information technology, which deals with radio and television broadcasting. Audio engineering and RF engineering are also essential parts of broadcast engineering, being their own subsets of electrical engineering.

Broadcast engineering involves both the studio and transmitter aspects (the entire airchain), as well as remote broadcasts. Every station has a broadcast engineer, though one may now serve an entire station group in a city. In small media markets the engineer may work on a contract basis for one or more stations as needed.

==Duties==

Modern duties of a broadcast engineer include maintaining broadcast automation systems for the studio and automatic transmission systems for the transmitter plant. There are also important duties regarding radio towers, which must be maintained with proper lighting and painting. Occasionally a station&#x27;s engineer must deal with complaints of RF interference, particularly after a station has made changes to its transmission facilities.

==Titles==

Broadcast engineers may have varying titles depending on their level of expertise and field specialty. Some widely used titles include:
* Broadcast design engineer
* Broadcast Integration Engineer
* Broadcast systems engineer
* Broadcast IT engineer
* Broadcast IT systems engineer
* Broadcast network engineer
* Broadcast maintenance engineer
* Broadcast technician
* Video broadcast engineer
* TV studio broadcast engineer
* Outside broadcast engineer
* Remote broadcast engineer

==Qualifications==

Broadcast engineers may need to possess some or all of the following degrees, depending on the broadcast technical environment. If one of the formal qualifications is not present, a related degree or equivalent professional experience is desirable.
* Degree in electrical engineering
* Degree in electronic engineering
* Degree in telecommunications engineering
* Degree in computer engineering
* Degree in management information system
* Degree in broadcast technology

===Knowledge===

Broadcast engineers are generally required to know the following areas, from conventional video broadcast systems to modern Information Technology:
* Conventional broadcast
** Audio/Video instrumentation measurement
** Baseband video – standard / high-definition
** Broadcast studio acoustics
** Television studios - broadcast video cameras and camera lenses
** Production switcher (Video mixer)
** Audio mixer
** Recording engineer
* Broadcast IT
** Video compression - DV25, MPEG, DVB or ATSC (or ISDB)
** Digital server playout technologies. - VDCP, Louth, Harris, control protocols
** Broadcast automation
** Disk storage – RAID / NAS / SAN technologies.
** Archives – Tape archives or grid storage technologies.
** Computer networking
** Operating systems – Microsoft Windows / macOS / Linux / RTOS
** Post production – video capture and non-linear editing systems (NLEs).
* RF
** RF satellite uplinking – High-powered amplifiers (HPA)
** RF communications satellite downlinking – Band detection, carrier detection and IRD tuning, etc.
** RF transmitter maintenance - IOT UHF transmitters, solid-state VHF transmitters, solid-state MF transmitters (AM radio), tube type VHF, and MF transmitters. Antennas, transmission lines, high power filters, digital modulators, towers, tower lighting systems, and backup generators.
* Health and safety
** Occupational safety and health
** Fire suppression systems like FM 200.
** Basic structural engineering
** RF hazard mitigation

Above mentioned requirements vary from station to station.

==Digital engineering==
The conversion to digital broadcasting means broadcast engineers must now be well-versed in digital television and digital radio, in addition to analogue principles. New equipment from the transmitter to the radio antenna to the receiver may be encountered by engineers new to the field. Furthermore, modern techniques place a greater demand on an engineer&#x27;s expertise, such as sharing broadcast towers or radio antennas among different stations (diplexing).

Digital audio and digital video have revolutionized broadcast engineering in many respects. Broadcast studios and control rooms are now already digital in large part, using non-linear editing and digital signal processing for what used to take a great deal of time or money, if it was even possible at all. Mixing consoles for both audio and video are continuing to become more digital in the 2000s, as is the computer storage used to keep digital media libraries. Effects processing and TV graphics can now be realized much more easily and professionally as well.

With the broadcast industry&#x27;s shift to IP-based production and content delivery technology not only the production technology and workflows are changing, but also the requirements for broadcast engineers, which now include IT and IP-networking know-how.

Other devices used in broadcast engineering are telephone hybrids, broadcast delays, and dead air alarms. See the Glossary of electrical and electronics engineering for further explanations.

<text>Long Island Arena (also commonly known as the Commack Arena, Suffolk Forum, and The Island Music Center) was a 4,000-seat indoor arena in Commack, New York from 1959 until 1996. The Long Island Ducks of the Eastern Hockey League, a popular team in the small community, called the Arena home from 1959 until the league folded in 1973, one year after the New York Islanders came into existence. The Long Island Cougars (an affiliate of the WHA&#x27;s Chicago Cougars) also played at the Long Island Arena from 1973 through 1975.

From 1968 to 1969, the Commack Arena briefly served as the home of the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association. Before the team&#x27;s move to Long Island, the then-New Jersey Americans had scheduled a game against the Kentucky Colonels at the Commack Arena on March 23, 1968. The Americans and Colonels were tied in the standings, and a &quot;play-in&quot; game to determine who would qualify for the playoffs. The Americans were forced to move the game at the last minute because their normal home, the Teaneck Armory, was booked with the circus. However, when the Colonels and Americans arrived at the arena, they found the court full of holes and laden with condensation from a Ducks hockey game the previous night. The court was also unstable. The Colonels refused to take the court under these conditions. The league ruled that the Americans had failed to provide acceptable facilities and forfeited the game to the Colonels, 2–0. The Long Island Ducks of the Eastern Basketball Association also spent one season playing at Long Island Arena during 1977–1978.

Along with hockey and basketball, the Long Island Arena was used for ice skating, the circus, the Suffolk County Fair and concerts.

Peter Frampton recorded part of his 8× platinum double album, &quot;Frampton Comes Alive&quot;, at the arena.

John F. Kennedy made a visit to the arena on November 6, 1960, while campaigning for the presidency.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Long Island Arena housed a large, indoor flea market until the facility closed on July 31, 1996. A shopping center, consisting of Target, Hobby Lobby, and a Whole Foods supermarket, among other stores and restaurants, now stands on the former site of the arena, which was located on the south side of Veterans Highway just west of the Sunken Meadow State Parkway.

<doc id="768301" wikidata="Q1352553" url="?curid=768301" title="Showtaro Morikubo">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor and singer who has voiced characters in anime, drama CDs, and video games. He was formerly affiliated with I&#x27;m Enterprise, Sigma Seven and VIMS. His most notable roles were Shikamaru Nara from &quot;Naruto&quot;, Souji Okita in the &quot;Hakuouki&quot; series, X in the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series, Yuusuke Makishima from &quot;Yowamushi Pedal&quot;, and Yosuke Hanamura from &quot;Persona 4&quot;.

==Biography==
Morikubo graduated from Third Junior &amp; Senior High School of Nihon University in 1992, and dropped out of Tama Art University. Before becoming a full-fledged voice actor, he worked at a talent agency, and was recruited by people in the voice acting industry who saw a performance by the Onigiri Skippers, a theater troupe he founded with his seniors from the lab party he attended in elementary school. During his first dubbing session, he made sounds out of flipping pages on the script because he had no experience as a voice actor at that time. The script for the first episode had four pages of long dialogues from the first page, and the sound director said that he would never have let him do the role if he had known he would talk so much. He made his voice acting debut in 1996 as a Mini 4 Fighter in &quot;Bakusō Kyōdai Let&#x27;s &amp; Go!!&quot;. The show was supposed to finish in a year, but due to its unexpected popularity, it became a long-running production, and he moved from the agency where he had worked as an actor to a voice acting agency. Since then, he has been active in a variety of fields including animation, games, radio personality, music, and stage.

After working at Sigma Seven, Morikubo moved to VIMS, an office affiliated with Arts Vision.

In 1998, he and voice actor Hideo Ishikawa started a music unit called &quot;Anzu&quot; (derived from the only fruit Morikubo could eat), and in 1999, they formed the band &quot;AN&#x27;s ALL STARS&quot; with other band members. In August of the same year, he formed the band &quot;Mosquito Milk&quot;.

In 2001, Morikubo made his solo debut under the Capcom Suleputer label, and in 2008, he debuted again under the Lantis label. In 2010, he formed &quot;Buzzy→Bee&quot; as a solo project, and in January 2015, he became the second DJ of the long-running bayfm program &quot;KEIYOGINKO POWER COUNTDOWN JAPAN HOT 30&quot;.

In 2016, he received the Kei Tomiyama Memorial Award at the 10th Seiyu Awards. In 2020, he received the Personality Award at the 14th Seiyu Awards.

On August 31, 2018, Morikubo left VIMS. On September 1 of the same year, he established Add9th and assumed the position of its representative director.

Morikubo married fellow voice actress Yū Asakawa on February 22, 2007. On January 14, 2009, Asakawa announced on her blog that the two had amicably divorced, citing differences in personality as the reason for the separation.

On July 4, 2014, Morikubo announced on his blog that he had gotten married that week, but expressed a desire to keep details of the marriage private, including the identity of his wife due to her being uninvolved in the entertainment industry. On December 28, 2017, he revealed on an episode of his radio show The BAY☆LINE that he and his wife had welcomed a daughter earlier in the year. The same day, he reaffirmed the news via Twitter.

He and Kentarō Itō call each other their best friend. Morikubo has been in charge of the stage music for the K-Show theater company, which Itō presides over, since its inception.

===Albums===
&quot;Hard Spirit&quot; is an album released from one of Morikubo&#x27;s most popular voice actor units, Heart-beat, in which he paired up with fellow voice actor Hiroki Takahashi. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Shootin&#x27; Stars&quot; and &quot;Continued&quot;. This album was also featured in a three part live action series, &quot;Cross Chord&quot;, a drama starring both voice actors as the lead characters. In addition to the main album, both Morikubo and Takahashi released separate albums (titled &quot;Show&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; for each artist, respectively) containing solo versions of the Hard Spirit songs, along with two exclusively solo tracks, each (both of which are also included on &quot;Hard Spirit&quot;). Morikubo sings alone in &quot;Hurry Up Drive&quot; and &quot;Change or Never change&quot;, and Takahashi&#x27;s solos are &quot;Thanks for...&quot; and &quot;Believe me&quot;.

<doc id="768305" wikidata="Q5517069" url="?curid=768305" title="Gail Edwards">
<text>Gail Edwards is an American retired actress. She has appeared as Dot Higgins in ABC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, Sharon LeMeure in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Blossom&quot;, and Vicky Larson in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Full House.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Edwards was raised in Coral Gables, Florida. Her father hung the curtain and lights while she choreographed, costumed, and starred in her own neighborhood musicals. In the sixth grade, Edwards played Little Mary in &quot;The Women&quot; at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Coconut Grove, Florida, where playwright George Abbott came backstage to single out her performance.

==Career==

Edwards wrote, produced, and starred in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Becoming&quot;. It won the Miami Herald Critics’ Choice award three times before the musical debuted in New York. While in New York, Edwards signed with the LeMond/Zetter Management Group. Soon afterward, she landed the role of Sandy opposite Peter Gallagher in Broadway&#x27;s East Coast tour of &quot;Grease&quot;. After producing and starring in two additional productions, &quot;The Good One&quot; and &quot;Vanities&quot;, both earning her the Drama-Logue Critics&#x27; Award, Edwards turned her focus toward television acting.

Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1976, Edwards signed with the Ro Diamond Agency (later with the Gersh Agency) and immediately began landing guest-star roles on such television series as &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;.

In 1979, Edwards auditioned for a Witt/Thomas production, in which she landed the role of Dot Higgins on ABC&#x27;s &quot;It’s a Living&quot;. The series ran on ABC from 1980 to 1982 and was revived in first-run syndication from 1985 to 1989. Edwards, along with Barrie Youngfellow, Paul Kreppel, and Marian Mercer, were the only four members of the &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; cast who lasted during the network and syndicated runs. After ABC canceled the show in 1982, Edwards&#x27; management was informed by the producers of &quot;Happy Days&quot; that they were offering her the role of new character K.C. Cunningham, the niece of Howard and Marion Cunningham who was moving in with the family. Without informing Edwards of the offer, her management declined the opportunity, reportedly stating that they did not want Edwards &quot;playing a new character on an old show&quot;. Crystal Bernard was then hired for the part. Edwards did not learn of the incident until many years later. In 1985, Edwards and Bernard wound up as co-stars on &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, when the latter resumed production for first-run syndication.

Edwards also appeared in many movies-of-the-week during the 1980s, along with numerous other guest-star appearances in such series as &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot; and the premiere episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg and original music/score by John Williams.

In 1990, Edwards was reunited with former &quot;Happy Days&quot; producers Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett, when she was cast as divorced mother Hilary Kozak on their single-season CBS sitcom &quot;The Family Man&quot;. Upon the series&#x27; cancellation in the summer of 1991, Edwards was asked by Miller and Boyett to join the cast of their hit ABC series &quot;Full House&quot;. They felt Edwards was right for the role of Vicky Larson, a talk show host who strikes up a relationship with Danny Tanner. Edwards made her &quot;Full House&quot; debut late that year, when the Vicky character first appeared as a substitute host for Rebecca Donaldson, who was on maternity leave, on (the fictional) &quot;Wake Up, San Francisco&quot;. Vicky and Danny soon embark on a long-term relationship and are engaged in the show&#x27;s seventh season. Edwards&#x27; co-star on &quot;The Family Man&quot;, Scott Weinger, was transferred over to &quot;Full House&quot; along with her, playing Steve Hale, the high school boyfriend of D.J. Tanner.

During her tenure on &quot;Full House&quot;, Edwards also had the recurring guest role of Sharon LeMeure, the fast-talking mother of Six on NBC’s &quot;Blossom&quot;. Edwards&#x27; work on &quot;Blossom&quot; reunited her with former &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, who produced both series.

Edwards concluded her roles in &quot;Full House&quot; (with Vicky Larson having a mutual breakup with Danny Tanner) and &quot;Blossom&quot; in the spring of 1994. She retired from show business at that time and moved to the Southwest.

In September 2017, it was announced that Edwards would return to acting by reprising her role as Vicky Larson in the third season of the &quot;Full House&quot; sequel series &quot;Fuller House&quot;. She appears in the Season 3 finale, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. Edwards then made another appearance in the series finale, &quot;Our Very Last Show, Again&quot;.

==Retirement==
Edwards has supported and participated in several charities, including performing for the Veterans Administration, where she played ukulele that she learned just for this purpose. While in Miami, Edwards had an impromptu visit with Romero Britto who painted her ukulele, for which she thanked him in song via YouTube.

<text>In sociology, an ethnic enclave is a geographic area with high ethnic concentration, characteristic cultural identity, and economic activity. The term is usually used to refer to either a residential area or a workspace with a high concentration of ethnic firms. Their success and growth depends on self-sufficiency, and is coupled with economic prosperity.

Douglas Massey describes how migrant networks provide new immigrants with social capital that can be transferred to other tangible forms. As immigrants tend to cluster in close geographic spaces, they develop migrant networks—systems of interpersonal relations through which participants can exchange valuable resources and knowledge. Immigrants can capitalize on social interactions by transforming information into tangible resources, and thereby lower costs of migration. Information exchanged may include knowledge of employment opportunities, affordable housing, government assistance programs and helpful NGOs. By stimulating social connections, enclaves can generate intangible resources that help to promote the social and economic development of its members.

By providing a space for people who share the same ethnic identity to create potentially beneficial relations, ethnic enclaves can assist members in achieving economic mobility. By reducing their exposure to language and cultural barriers, enclave economies can improve co-ethnics&#x27; incorporation into the economy. Enclaves can help to explain the success of some immigrant groups. Additionally, while the ethnic enclave theory was developed to explain immigrant incorporation into the receiving society, it has also been linked to migration processes at large as successful incorporation of immigrants has the potential to lower migration costs for future immigrants, an example of chain migration.

Despite their immediate benefits, the long-term implications of participation in an ethnic enclave are a topic of debate. Enclave economies have been linked to a glass ceiling limiting immigrant growth and upward mobility. While participation in the enclave economy may assist in achieving upward mobility through increased availability of employment opportunities in the enclave labor market, it may also impede acquisition of host country skills that benefit the immigrant over the long-run. Such delays constrain immigrants to activity within the enclave and secludes them from the larger economy. Opportunities available to mainstream society can thus be out of reach for immigrants who haven&#x27;t learned about them. Thus, the accelerated path toward economic mobility that lures new immigrants into enclave economies may impede success. One 2024 study, for example, found that relocation from an ethnic enclave led to greater economic outcomes for those who were relocated. Integration into an ethnic enclave may delay and even halt cultural assimilation, preventing the immigrants from benefiting from mainstream institutions.

==History==

Ethnic enclaves have been prominent urban features for centuries. Examples include a new Armenian one near Beirut, an old one in Bucharest, and an even older Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem. Urban quarters have often belonged mainly to residents having a particular sectarian or ethnic origin. 

Historically, the formation of ethnic enclaves has been the result of a variety of socioeconomic factors that draw immigrants to similar spaces in the receiving city, state, or country. Cultural diversity brings together people who don&#x27;t understand each other&#x27;s language but a group can communicate more easily with neighbors in an enclave. In some cases, enclaves have been enforced by law, as in a ghetto. Roman colonies were established to control newly conquered provinces, and grew to absorb the surrounding territory. Some enclaves were established when a governing authority permitted a group to establish their own new town, as in the English town of Gravesend, Brooklyn in 1645.

The lack of access to economic capital and of knowledge regarding residential neighborhoods can constrain newly arrived immigrants to regions of affordable housing. Social dynamics such as prejudice and racism may concentrate co-ethnics into regions displaying ethnic similarity. Housing discrimination may also prevent ethnic minorities from settling into a particular residential area outside the enclave. When discussing the ethnic enclave as defined by a spatial cluster of businesses, economic success, and growth can be largely predicted by three factors. These factors include 1) the size and population of the enclave, 2) the level of entrepreneurial skills of those in the enclave, and 3) the availability of capital resources to the enclave. Successful enclaves can reach a point where they become self-sufficient, or &quot;institutionally complete&quot; through the supply of new immigrants and demand of goods offered in the market. They only reach this point after first supplying for the needs of co-ethnics and then expanding to meet needs of those in the larger market of the host society.

The term &quot;ethnic enclave&quot; arose in response to a publication by Alejandro Portes and Kenneth Wilson in 1980. Portes and Wilson identified a third labor market in which Cuban immigrants in Miami took part. Instead of entering the secondary labor market of the host society, Portes and Wilson discovered that new immigrants tended to become employed by co-ethnics running immigrant-owned firms. The collection of small immigrant enterprises providing employment to new immigrants was defined as the enclave economy.

==Theories==

===Enclave economy hypothesis===

Observations of the Cuban ethnic enclave economy in Miami led Alejandro Portes and Kenneth Wilson to conclude that participation in an enclave economy provided immigrants with an alternative, speedy option to achieve economic mobility in a host society. The discourse pioneered by Portes and Wilson produced the construct for a body of literature that came to be known by the ethnic enclave hypothesis. While never empirically defined, the term &quot;ethnic enclave&quot; began to be widely used to represent two distinct definitions: that of an enclave economy and that of a residential area of high co-ethnic concentration. The most fundamental concept within the enclave hypothesis is that of social capital, which lays the foundation for the establishment of migrant networks and the advantages associated with them.

===Cumulative causation===
With the rise in globalization and ease of international transportation, patterns of immigration show the role of ethnic enclaves for contributing to increased migration over time. New immigrants unintentionally lower costs for future immigration of co-ethnics by pooling together resources for themselves. Thus, by achieving mobility in the receiving country themselves, immigrants create a social structure that makes it easier for future immigrants to become upwardly mobile. According to Douglas Massey, &quot;Networks build into the migration process a self-perpetuating momentum that leads to its growth over time, in spite of fluctuating wage differentials, recessions, and increasingly restrictive immigration policies.&quot; 
Ethnic enclaves thus contribute to continued immigration by providing co-ethnics with a space to make connections that ultimately lower migration costs and promote economic mobility. Many worn path taken by former immigrants are made accessible to enclave members, making immigration easier to future generations. By generating further immigration, migration leads to its own cumulative causation over time.

==Modes of incorporation==
An approach that analyzes ethnic enclaves and their members by their modes of incorporation is preferred to a neoclassical model, which states that the economic success of immigrants depends on the education, work experience, and other elements of human capital that they possess. Sociologists have concluded that these factors do not suffice in explaining the integration and success of immigrants measured by occupational mobility and earnings.

===Social===

Upon arrival to a foreign country, immigrants face challenges in assimilation and integration processes and thus experience different modes and levels of incorporation within the host society. Many factors influence the level of ease or challenge experienced by immigrants as they make the transition and undergo physical, social, and psychological challenges. The segmented assimilation model notes that there can exist a &quot;consciously pluralistic society in which a variety of subcultures and racial and ethnic identities coexist&quot; 

One influential factor in an immigrant&#x27;s journey is the presence of relatives or friends in the receiving country. Friends and family, making up a kinship network, who are willing to help the newcomers can be classified as a type of capital commonly referred to as social capital. Upon arrival, many immigrants have limited or no access to human capital and thus rely heavily on any available source of social capital. The cost to immigration is large, however this burden can be shared and thus eased through an immigrant&#x27;s access to social capital in the receiving country. Kinship networks in the receiving country can provide aid not only for the physical and economic needs of immigrants, but also for their emotional and socio-psychological needs.

====Quality of kinship networks ====

Access to social capital does not guarantee ease or success for the migrant. Because social capital is rooted in relationships it easily lends itself to conflict and disagreement between parties. The level of economic stability on the side of the receiving party can dictate the level of aid they are willing or able to offer. In addition, the economic condition of the country and the availability of jobs open to the immigrants can largely affect the quality of the support network available to the migrant. If the receiving country provides favorable conditions such as access to social programs, the local economy, and employment opportunities, the network is likely to be of much higher quality. Adversely, kinship networks may break down if much stress is placed on the relationships involved due to economic hardships. The duration and intensity of aid needed can dictate the quality of the kinship network available to the immigrant. Immigrant ideas regarding level of support to be received are often high and left unmet if true economic conditions do not allow for favorable network conditions. Shared norms and relational ties can also lead to obligatory ties which some scholars, such as Tsang and Inkpen, argue restricts an individual&#x27;s willingness to explore opportunities outside the network.

====Ethnic identity====

Methods of assimilation and access to social capital vary between and even within ethnic groups. A variety of factors can influence individuals&#x27; ethnic identities including their social class background and the social networks available to them. As theorized by sociologist Mary C. Waters, the involvement level of parents in ethnic organizations or activities heavily influences the development of their children&#x27;s ethnic identities. This is important to note as second-generation immigrants must actively work to identify themselves with their ethnic group.

====Enclave networks====

Enclave networks offer access to a unique type of social capital and act as large kinship networks. Within enclave networks, social capital commonly exists both as a private and public good. Though there is some debate in relation to the long-term benefits offered by these networks, the short-term benefits are universally acknowledged. The socio-psychological challenges faced by the immigrant can be largely reduced through the individual&#x27;s entrance into an ethnic enclave. Ethnic enclaves can resemble the immigrant&#x27;s place of origin through physical look, layout, and language employed both written and orally. In addition to increasing the cultural comfort of the migrant, healthy ethnic enclaves offer solidarity and trust among members, and informal training systems within the workplace. The geographic proximity of the enclave network allows for easy flow of knowledge and varying types of assistance between firms as well. Where there is an atmosphere of trust in ethnic enclaves, this transfer of knowledge and sharing of social capital exists as an asset to the firms. Connections with members in an enclave may also afford the newcomer work opportunities. Immigrants may also receive informal training regarding the customs and practices of the larger culture outside the enclave and help navigating challenges in many areas of everyday life. Social hostility may be a challenge faced by immigrants in their host society, therefore to avoid this factor, ethnic enclaves provide a haven where economic success may still be achieved.

===Economic===

Ethnic enclave economies are predicated upon aspects of economic sociology and the sociology of immigration. Ethnic Enclaves generate a pool of social capital through which members can access resources that lower the costs of migration. Enclave membership provides economic assistance such as job opportunities and small businesses loans. Small ethnic firms within the enclave provide new immigrants with immediate access to economic opportunities by subverting the secondary sector of the economy and creating numerous low-wage jobs that are easily accessed by members.
The ethno-centric nature of businesses and firms provides easy integration into enclave economies. Goods and services tend to be offered in the ethnic group&#x27;s language, while social and cultural norms specific to the host country are not required of employees in the enclave economy. Thus, the ethno-specific nature of enclave economies makes them attractive to new immigrants who are otherwise unable integrate into the mainstream economy.

Ethnic enclave economies also provide a method for immigrants who enter at lower wage jobs to rise to the status community entrepreneurs own firms within the community. While benefiting from the higher wages that owning a business provides them, these established immigrants continue the cycle of providing attractive (albeit lower income) labor to newcomers within the framework of the ethnic enclave. The ethnic enclave economy allows for a measure of independence for immigrants by creating a path for them to own businesses. Ethnic enclave economies also have the effect of raising the hourly wages of workers within the enclave.

An individual&#x27;s entrance into the enclave economy is dependent upon the conditions of incorporation they experience. Unfavorable modes of incorporation into the host society provide incentives for immigrants to enter the informal economy. Discrimination, hostility, and a lack of resources may encourage immigrants to enter into informal employment. Ethnic enclaves are rich in informal activities, as the entrepreneurial services making the core of the enclave&#x27;s founding were historically informal ventures. Informality proves favorable for many immigrant entrepreneurs by bypass regulatory expenses. Additionally, the scope of employment for immigrants is greatly widened by the availability of informal jobs in the enclave economic sector. The informality of the enclave economy simultaneously induces risk and fraud. Informal activities are constantly under risk of detection by the formal sector, which has a negative effect on job security. Furthermore, due to the absence of legal framework, immigrant laborers often remain silent about various forms of exploitation. The most common form of labor exploitation in immigrant economies is unpaid labor. Undocumented immigrants are especially afraid to report violations of labor laws and exploitation.

===Political and civic involvement===
Government policy toward immigrants is the first mode of reception to the receiving country. Governments generally enforce measures to reduce the amount of &quot;unwanted&quot; immigrants which may potentially pose a burden on the receiving society and economy.

The granting of different statuses and visas (i.e. refugee, temporary visas for students and workers) to immigrant groups affects the type of reception immigrants will receive. Aside from immigration control policies, some governments also impose measures to accelerate social and political incorporation of new immigrants, and to stimulate economic mobility.

Wayne Cornelius studies two central theses regarding institutional response to increased movement of people across transnational borders. The first of these is the gap hypothesis which describes the dissonance between official immigration policies and real policy outcomes. Policy gaps are the result of unintended consequences and inadequate enforcement by the receiving society. Many reasons can explain unintended consequences of immigration policy. Governments with undefined or ambiguous stances toward immigration may propagate unintended consequences, and the reliance on flawed policies can further reduce the efficacy of institutional measures. Furthermore, political incoherency policy poses a greater challenge for the incorporation and enforcement of effective measures.

A negative public opinion toward immigrants is a good measure of significant policy gaps in the receiving government; however, special interest groups may also constrain political responses to immigration. This is especially true in liberal democracies, where &quot;lobbying by powerful employer groups, religious groups, ethnic and immigrant advocacy groups, and even labor unions leads governments to adopt more expansionary immigration policies, even when the economy goes bad and general public opinion turns hostile to immigrants.&quot; Furthermore, governments and special groups in the immigrant-sending country may align themselves with pro-immigration lobbyists in the receiving country. Thus, the policymaking process is complicated by involvement of multiple factions.

The second thesis studied by Wayne Cornelius is the convergence hypothesis, which describes the growing similarity of political responses to immigration among immigrant-receiving countries. These similarities fall into: &quot;(1) the policies that their governments have adopted to control immigration; (2) policies designed to integrate immigrants into host societies by providing them with social services as well as political, economic, and social rights; and (3) attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy preferences among general publics.&quot;

Ethnic groups receive various levels of reception by the host society for various reasons. In general, European immigrants tend to encounter little resistance by host countries, while tenets of racism are evinced by widespread resistance to immigrants of color.

Political incorporation into the host country is coupled with adoption of citizenship of the host country. By studying the diverging trajectories of immigrant citizenship in Canada and the U.S., Irene Bloemraad explains that current models of citizenship acquisition fail to recognize the social nature of political incorporation. Bloemraad describes political incorporation as a &quot;social process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement.&quot; This alternative model emphasizes the role of migrant networks in critically shaping how immigrants consider citizenship. Bloemraad shows that friends, family, co-ethnic organizations and local community affect political incorporation by providing a structured mobilization framework. This social structure is most essential for immigrants who face language barriers and may lack familiarity with host institutions.

The extent to which migrant networks promote citizenship depends on the efficacy of government policies on immigrant integration. Governments adopting policies that facilitate the emergence, integration and growth of ethnic economies are presumed to gain support by co-ethnics. Thus, the movement toward political incorporation and citizenship is nested in a larger institutional structure involving economic and social integration policy as these relate to immigrants.
Ethnic enclaves have the ability to simultaneously assist in political and civic incorporation of immigrants. By providing a space that facilitates upward mobility and economic integration into the receiving society, enclaves and their members fundamentally influence the perceptions of receiving institutions by co-ethnics. Finally, enclaves may gauge community interest in naturalization and direct immigrants through the process to gaining citizenship

==Ethnic enclave debate==

Ethnic enclaves have prompted debate among scholars in two related areas of thought. Both areas discuss the role ethnic enclaves play by either offering aid or hindering the economic and social well-being of the enclave&#x27;s members. One area of thought discusses the role of enclaves in assimilative patterns and upward mobility while the second area of thought argues the economic ramifications associated with membership within ethnic enclaves.

The immediate economic and social advantages associated with membership in an ethnic enclave are undisputed by scholars, however the long-term consequences remain an area of uncertainty. The role these networks play remains uncertain due to the fact that ethnic enclaves allow immigrants to function successfully within the host society without a significant amount of adjustment either culturally or linguistically. As such, they can either help or hinder naturalization within the host country. The relatively low levels of skill required allow immigrants to achieve financial stability which can in turn encourage eventual naturalization and assimilation. Adversely, this same factor can afford enclave members the opportunity to remain considerably segregated and secluded from the host society. As such, members may circumvent the need to acquire skills necessary for life in the larger host society such as knowledge of cultural norms and language.

The debate regarding the economic viability of ethnic enclaves revolves around the enclave-economy hypothesis. The hypothesis as written by Wilson and Portes formulates the idea that &quot;[i]mmigrant workers are not restricted to the secondary labor market.&quot; They instead argue that &quot;those inserted into an immigrant enclave can be empirically distinguished from workers in both the primary and secondary labor markets. Enclave workers will share with those in the primary sector a significant economic return past human capital investments&quot; something those who enter the secondary labor market are not able to enjoy.
Thus, they assert the enclave economy is not a mobility trap as some would term it, but an alternate mode of incorporation.

In their argument formulated to disprove the enclave economy hypothesis, Sanders and Nee state the need for a distinction between &quot;immigrant-bosses&quot; and &quot;immigrant-workers&quot; as the economic benefits differ along this distinction. They also call for the investigation of economic opportunities available to those in the enclave, believing them to be lesser in quality and supply. Sanders and Nee also assert the idea that segregation and forced entrance of immigrant-workers into low paying jobs is actually aggravated by the existence of ethnic enclaves. Due to these objections, they call for the revision of Portes and Wilson&#x27;s hypothesis to include an acknowledgement and outline of the entrepreneur/worker economic benefit distinction.

In reaction to Sanders and Nee, Portes and Jensen make the clarification that those in ethnic enclaves need not be wealthier than those who left the enclave for the hypothesis to be supported. They instead assert that this will usually not be the case as the constant entrance of new immigrants into the enclave will actually be somewhat burdensome on the economy; a factor which does not actually represent disadvantage when compared with the other advantages provided. Additionally, Portes and Jensen outline three different conditions to be fulfilled in order to disprove their hypothesis. The first of these conditions requires the demonstration that ethnic entrepreneurship is a mobility trap leading to lower earnings than the immigrant&#x27;s worth in human capital. The second condition requires data proving the work within the enclave to be exploitative, and the third condition requires data showing employment within the enclave leads to a &#x27;dead end&#x27; and offers no chance of upward mobility. They acknowledge that the fulfillment of these three requirements is difficult as there is little data available to accurately test them.

Jennifer Lee adds to the discussion noting the particular niches and types of business immigrant groups enter. She notes that it is most common for immigrants to participate in long hours of physically demanding work in the retail industry. The retail market is a viable option due to the relatively low startup costs and knowledge of the host country&#x27;s language required. Different niches have different levels of communication, for example the retail and self-service niche, (fruit and vegetable markets, take out restaurants) typically require the lowest level of customer interaction and communication. Lee notes the embeddedness of ethnic enclaves and brings the thought that such practices are good for those within the enclave but harmful to certain groups outside them. She also notes the adverse effects patterns of ethnic embeddedness can have on surrounding ethnic groups by noting the difficulty other groups face in joining the network. She argues that this type of retail niche domination can have positive consequences for co-ethnics, as Portes and Wilson believe, however can also have negative effects on surrounding ethnic groups who face exclusion due solely to their ethnic dissimilarity from the network.

==Ethnic enclaves in the United States==

Immigration to the United States has occurred in waves that demonstrate the predominance of certain sets of ethnic minorities. As immigrants tended to cluster in certain cities and states, separate waves were responsible for the establishment of ethnic enclaves in separate physical spaces. The best-known ethnic enclaves in American cities began to appear with the arrival of large numbers of Irish immigrants during the first third of the nineteenth century and continued forming throughout that century and the twentieth as successive waves of immigrants arrived in the United States. In the early 20th century, immigrants chose to live in enclave neighborhoods because of language barriers and cost-of-living benefits. Sociologists Robert Park and Edward Burgess integrated a model that studied these patterns in the 1920s. This model showcased how immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the early 20th century were drawn to urban enclave neighborhoods as they opened up opportunities for social networking and employment. 

In 1998, nearly three quarters of all immigrants in the United States lived in California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey or Illinois. Housing discrimination remains a factor in the persistence of racial enclaves in American cities. However, more recent patterns of migration, such as chain migration, challenge traditional methods of enclaves establishment.

A 2023 study found that 43% of the foreign-born population in the United States lived in ethnic neighborhoods in 1970. By 2010, this had risen to 67%. Ethnic neighborhoods tend to have lower average incomes and housing values, as well as more rental housing and more inhabitants that commute without a car.

Most ethnic neighborhoods in the United States disappear within a decade or two, as immigrants gain language abilities, cultural skills, and resources and subsequently move elsewhere.

== Historical ethnic enclaves ==
Ethnic enclaves have become commonplace in modern times, with the increase in the geographic mobility of humankind. However, they have also arisen in historical times, for various reasons. The village of Schandorf, now in Austria, was for centuries a Croatian ethnic enclave, surrounded by areas of Austrian and Hungarian ethnicity. The enclave originated around 1543 when the Hungarian magnate Batthyany sought to repopulate lands that had been emptied by devastating Turkish attacks; he invited Croatian settlers. The town of Alghero in Sardinia still marginally preserves a Catalan ethnic enclave; this dates from a military conquest of the town by Catalans in the 14th century. Ethnic enclaves also arose when a people remained in its original territory but came to be surrounded by a far more numerous majority, as in the case of Vepsians and Russians. The city of Hat Yai in southern Thailand is an ethnic enclave for Malay Muslims and Chinese people.

<text>The game of French Tarot is a trick-taking strategy tarot card game played by three to five players using a traditional 78-card tarot deck. The game is played in France and also in French-speaking Canada. It should not be confused with French tarot, which refers to all aspects of cartomancy and games using tarot cards in France.

== Background ==

France was one of the first two countries outside of Italy to start playing tarot, the other being Switzerland. While various types of tarot games were played in France since the 16th century, the dominant form now popular is the 19th-century rule set from Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Historically, tarot games in France were played with the Italian-suited Tarot of Marseilles which had Renaissance allegorical images on the &quot;atouts&quot; while lacking reversible court cards and trumps and corner indices. For ease of play, the late 19th century French-suited &quot;Tarot Nouveau&quot; or &quot;Bourgeois Tarot&quot; supplanted the Marseilles Tarot with depictions of typical &quot;fin de siècle&quot; genre scenes of French life and leisure.

In English, the game is referred to as French Tarot or sometimes as French tarot, however, the latter usually refers to tarot cards of French origin or to cartomantic tarot and not to the game. The name French Tarot is used in English to differentiate the card game from other uses of the tarot deck that are more familiar in the Americas and English-speaking countries, particularly the decks used for cartomancy and other divinatory purposes, and also to distinguish it from other card games played with a tarot deck. The unique feature that distinguishes French Tarot from other forms of tarot games is the overtrumping rule. In France it is just known as &quot;jeu de Tarot&quot;.

== History ==
Cards appeared in Europe towards the end of the 14th century and may have been introduced first through Italy or Catalonia. Tarot cards are first mentioned in the mid-15th century in Italy. Initially called &quot;trionfi&quot;, meaning &quot;triumph&quot;, whence the name &quot;trump&quot; in English, the Italians later called them &quot;tarocchi&quot; as the idea of trumps spread to other card games. Both the Italian word &quot;tarocchi&quot; and the French word &quot;tarot&quot; occur from the early 16th century onwards, although it is unclear whether one was derived from the other.

Tarot was introduced into France in the early 16th century as a result of the First and Second Italian Wars (1494–1522) and is widely recorded in French literature of that century, the earliest reference being that by Rabelais in Gargantua in 1534. By 1622 it had become more popular in France than chess and the earliest account appeared around 1637 in Nevers. This describes a three-player, 78-card game played with an Italian-suited pack with the Fool acting as an Excuse and the suits ranking in their &#x27;original&#x27; order i.e. with numeral cards in the suits of Cups and Coins ranking from Ace (high) to Ten (low). This ranking is retained in all Tarot games today except in France and Sicily. In France, Tarot remained in vogue until 1650, but then its popularity steadily waned to the point where, in 18th century France, it was barely played outside the Provence region.

The game experienced a revival in the course of the late 18th and 19th centuries. The original Italian-suited cards typified by the Tarot de Marseille came to be viewed as Italian and were replaced by French designs, notably the Tarot Nouveau.

There is some evidence that Napoleon&#x27;s troops introduced Tarot, in the form of Droggn – a Tarot game with similarities to old French Tarot – into Austrian Tyrol. It is also recorded that French soldiers were issued with Tarot packs during the Franco-Prussian War (1870), First World War (1914–18) and Algerian War (1954–62), leading in each case to the spread of &quot;le jeu de Tarot&quot; throughout France according to Dummett and Berloquin. In 1973, the French Tarot Federation (&quot;Fédération Française de Tarot&quot;) was formed and, by the late 20th century, Tarot had become the second-most popular card game in France, only trailing Belote. Part of the reason why French Tarot persisted is the fact that the rules have been very consistent wherever the game is played. However, it is important to note that details of play outside of officially sanctioned tournaments may vary from circle to circle so that the known rules and terminologies are more typical than definitive.

In the late 18th century in France, Tarot cards first became associated with fortune telling, a practice that eventually spread to much of the Western world. However, the cards preferred for divination are the older Italian-suited packs or bespoke modern designs, which have occultic symbology, rather than the packs with scenes of everyday life like the French Tarot Nouveau, German Cego and Austro-Hungarian &quot;Industrie und Glück&quot; packs.

== Deck ==

The game is played using a 78-card tarot deck. This deck is composed of:

* 21 numbered trump cards (&quot;atouts&quot;), and 1 unnumbered trump card: the &quot;Excuse&quot; or &quot;Fool&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;excuse&quot; or &quot;Fou&quot;)
** 3 of these trumps, known as &quot;oudlers&quot;, have particular importance: the 1 of trumps, the 21 of trumps and the &quot;Excuse&quot; (or Fool). These determine the contract the taker commits to in that particular game. 
* 4 suits of 14 cards each: 
** numbered &quot;pip cards&quot; (aka &#x27;fillers&#x27;) from 1 to 10 have no true value, except when taking its &quot;fold&quot; or add .5 point at counting (the &quot;Ace&quot; has always the lowest value and so it is marked with number 1 instead of the &quot;A&quot; common in 52-card decks),
** four &quot;face cards&quot;; the &quot;Valet&quot; (Jack), &quot;&quot; (Knight; not seen in 52-card decks), &quot;Dame&quot; (Queen) and &quot;Roi&quot; (King) are respectively worth 2, 3, 4 and 5 points at end of match counting.

=== Rank of cards ===
Three cards known as &quot;oudlers&quot; (honours) are of particular importance in the game: the 1 of trumps (&quot;le petit&quot; or &quot;Little one&quot;), the 21 of trumps (&quot;le monde&quot; or &quot;The World&quot;, a holdover from the name of this card in the Tarot of Marseilles), and the &quot;Excuse&quot; (the Fool). These cards, when captured by the high bidder, lower the point threshold needed to fulfil the contract. In colloquial French, &quot;oudlers&quot; are often referred to as &quot;bouts&quot; (ends).

The ranking of the hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades from the top is: King, Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (Ace).

=== &quot;Excuse&quot; ===

The only card with a special effect is the &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Excuse&quot;. The &quot;Excuse&quot; may be played on any trick; it &quot;excuses&quot; the player from following suit. However, it normally doesn&#x27;t win the trick. The card also normally remains the property of the person who played it, not the winner of that trick; to compensate for this in the scoring count, the owner of the &quot;Excuse&quot; should instead give the winner of the trick a half-point card (a trump other than an &quot;oudler&quot;, or a suited number card; see Scoring) from the tricks the Excuse holder has already taken.

Two common exceptions to the above procedure occur when the &quot;Excuse&quot; is played to the last trick, and what happens depends on whether the side playing the Fool has taken all the previous tricks (see &quot;Chelem&quot;/Slam below). If the side has taken all previous tricks, the card takes the last trick; if not, it changes hands to the other side, even if the trick is won by a partner or fellow defender of the person playing it.

== Rules ==

For 3 or 4 players (5 with a simple variation). The 4-player variant is usually considered the most challenging and is the one played in competitions. The following rules are for 4 players.

=== Dealing ===
Players draw for the first deal; the person with the lowest-value card deals first, with suits ordered spades &gt; hearts &gt; diamonds &gt; clubs as a tiebreaker. All trumps rank higher than any suited card; anyone who draws the Fool must redraw. From this point, the deal will pass to the right (anticlockwise) for each subsequent deal.

The player at the left of the dealer cuts the deck. The dealer then deals out the entire deck, anticlockwise, starting with first hand. Each player is dealt their cards in packets of three consecutive cards at a time (they will each receive 6 such packets for a total of 18 cards). In addition, a &quot;chien&quot; (lit. &quot;dog&quot;, alt. &quot;kitty&quot;, &quot;talon&quot; or &quot;nest&quot;) of 6 cards is dealt one card at a time into the centre of the table, while dealing to the other players. A card may be dealt to the dog at any time, but the dealer may not:

* deal the dog two consecutive cards,
* deal the dog a card from the middle of a player&#x27;s packet, or
* deal the first or last card of the deck to the dog.

A common valid dealing order is player A → player B → dog → player C → dealer, but this is just one permutation and the dealer is free to choose the sequence while following the above rules.

A &quot;maldonne&quot; (misdeal) occurs when the dealer makes mistakes in the dealing; if this happens, the hand is redealt, either by the same dealer or the next in rotation. Players inspect, sort and evaluate their hands, and then move on to the bidding round.

=== Annulment ===
Before the bidding phase, if one player has a &quot;Petit sec&quot; (only one trump in hand, and it is the Petit, and does not have the Fool), then the player has to announce it and the hand is redealt. If it is discovered later in the game that a player had a &quot;Petit sec&quot;, then it is also annulled and redealt by the following dealer.

=== Bidding ===
The players look at the cards they have been dealt, and an auction begins, beginning with first hand and rotating anticlockwise. By bidding, a player states their confidence that they will be able to meet a set contract (see below) and sets the terms by which they will try to do so. If a player does not wish to bid, they may &quot;pass&quot; but may not bid after having passed previously. One may only bid higher than the previous bidders. The &quot;preneur&quot; (&quot;taker&quot;, sometimes called declarer as in Bridge) is the one who wins this auction and who must subsequently try to achieve the contract while the other players are the defenders and attempt to prevent the taker from doing so.

The level of bid is based on the strength of a player&#x27;s hand, usually estimated by counting the points within it. See evaluating one&#x27;s hand below for a method to determine the points within one&#x27;s hand.

The bids are, in increasing importance:
*Prise (&quot;take&quot;) or petite (&quot;small&quot;): if this is the winning bid the taker adds the &quot;dog&quot; to their hand, then confidentially sets aside a same number of cards of their choice, to bring their hand back to normal size before play begins. The discarded cards form the beginning of the taker&#x27;s score pile (the tricks pile). The name of this stack evolves from &quot;le chien&quot; to &quot;l&#x27;écart&quot; (&quot;the aside&quot;).
*Pousse (&quot;push&quot;): same actions and scoring as a &quot;prise&quot;, but outranks the &quot;prise&quot; and generally indicates a stronger hand value. This bid is not in the official rules, and is a holdover from an older bidding system (see below).
*Garde (&quot;guard&quot;): the same actions as &quot;prise&quot;, but the taker wins or loses double the usual stake.
*Garde sans (&quot;guard without&quot; the dog): the dog goes directly into the taker&#x27;s score pile, and no-one gets to see it until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth double the &quot;garde&quot; score (4x the base hand score) to whomever wins the hand.
*Garde contre (&quot;guard against&quot; the dog): the dog goes directly into the opposing score pile, without being shown until the end of the hand. The score is counted normally against the target number, but it is worth triple the &quot;garde&quot; score (6x the base hand score) to whomever wins the hand.

If no one bids, the hand is void and the deal passes to the right.

On a &quot;prise&quot;, &quot;pousse&quot; or &quot;garde&quot;, the taker may not set aside a king or a trump, except that if the player cannot discard anything else, they may discard a non-&quot;oudler&quot; trump. In this case, the taker has to display which trumps they set aside. An &quot;oudler&quot; may never be set aside.

In earlier rules, still played outside of competitions, in place of the &quot;prise&quot; and simple &quot;garde&quot;, there were two bids, in increasing importance: the &quot;petite&quot; (small) and the &quot;pousse&quot; (push). The &quot;prise&quot; is still sometimes known as &quot;petite&quot;. There are also some players who play without the &quot;prise&quot; contract, with &quot;garde&quot; as the minimum allowable bid.

=== Main phase ===

First hand leads the first trick, and play proceeds anticlockwise, with every player playing a card to the trick. Tricks are evaluated in a similar fashion as other trick-taking games with a trump suit; the highest trump, if played, takes the trick, and if trump is not played, the highest-value card of the led suit takes the trick. Every subsequent trick is led by the player who took the last trick. The leader of a trick can play any card they like.

Once the leader of a trick has played a card, everyone else must follow suit. If the first card played in a trick is the Fool, the suit which must be followed is determined by the next card. A player who cannot follow suit must play a trump card if able, and additionally, the player is compelled to overtrump if able (The &quot;Petit&quot; or 1 is valued lowest, and the &quot;Monde&quot; or 21 is valued highest). If a player must trump but cannot overtrump, they can play any trump. A player who cannot follow suit or trump may play any card to the trick, however it cannot win the trick.

If a trump is led to the trick, the others must play a trump, and each trump must exceed the rank of all trump previously played in the trick if possible. If this is not possible, a lower-ranked trump, or any card if the player has no trumps, can be played.

The Fool (&quot;L&#x27;Excuse&quot;) may be played to any trick, instead of following suit or trumping. The Fool never wins the trick, unless it is played to the last trick and the side playing it has taken every previous trick. However, it never changes sides, unless played to the last trick and the side playing it has &quot;not&quot; won every trick. After playing the Fool to a trick, the player who played it simply takes the Fool back, places it into their scoring pile and gives the side who took the trick an &quot;ordinary&quot; card (worth a half-point; see scoring below) from their scoring pile.

The official FFT tournament rules do not cover the public or private nature of the contents of scoring piles during play. Generally in trick-taking games, the contents of players&#x27; scoring piles are not public information during play of the hand, except in cases where a revoke is suspected (a player not following suit, trumping or overtrumping when it was possible for them to do so). A player is neither required to divulge the contents of the score pile nor permitted to look through it except as necessary to find a half-point card to replace the Fool.

=== Scoring ===
When the last trick has been played, the round ends. The taker counts the number of &quot;oudlers&quot; and the point value of all cards in the taker&#x27;s scoring pile. Alternatively, if the taker has taken the majority of tricks, the defenders can pool their scoring piles and count their &quot;oudlers&quot; and points; the taker has all remaining points.

==== Value of the cards ====

Cards for scoring purposes are divided into two groups: &quot;counters&quot; (face cards and &quot;oudlers&quot;) and &quot;ordinary&quot; cards or &quot;cartes basses&quot; (any suited pip card, and any trump except the 1 and 21). Cards are paired, with each counter matched to an ordinary card, and remaining ordinary cards are also paired. The values of pairs are then counted and summed:
*1 King or &quot;oudler&quot; + 1 ordinary card: 5 points
*1 Queen + 1 ordinary card: 4 points
*1 Knight + 1 ordinary card: 3 points
*1 Jack + 1 ordinary card: 2 points
*2 ordinary cards: 1 point

Each card thus has an individual value; the pairing simply makes it easier to count points. If a card cannot be paired, because there are an odd number in the scoring pile (common with three or five players) or more counters than ordinary cards:
*Kings and &quot;oudlers&quot; are worth points each;
*Queens are worth ;
*Knights are worth ;
*Jacks are worth ;
*All other cards are worth point.

==== Winning ====
The number of points the taker needs depends on how many of the &quot;oudlers&quot; (Excuse, Petit, 21 of trumps) are among the tricks won by the taker.

*With 3 &quot;oudlers&quot; the taker needs at least 36 card points to win;
*With 2 &quot;oudlers&quot; the taker needs at least 41 card points to win;
*With 1 &quot;oudler&quot; the taker needs at least 51 card points to win;
*With none the taker needs at least 56 card points to win.

There are 91 points to be taken in a round, so if the taker has:
*3 &quot;oudlers&quot;, the defenders need at least card points to win;
*2 &quot;oudlers&quot;, the defenders need at least card points to win;
*1 &quot;oudler&quot;, the defenders need at least card points to win;
*no &quot;oudler&quot;, the defenders need at least card points to win.

==== Updating the scorecard ====
Scoring in Tarot is &quot;zero-sum&quot;; when one player gains points, one or more other players lose an equal number. 
To calculate the basic &quot;hand score&quot; that is to be added or deducted, the scorer starts with a basic score of 25 points, then adds the absolute (non-negative) difference between the points earned by the taker and the threshold, and, if any, the &quot;Petit au bout&quot; bonus. This quantity is multiplied by the appropriate multiplier for the taker&#x27;s bid level (see Bidding), and then two additional bonuses may be added if they apply; the &quot;poignée&quot; or &quot;handful&quot; bonus, and the &quot;chelem&quot; or slam bonus (see below for descriptions of bonuses). Thus, calculation of the hand score is expressed by the formula

:s = (25 + E + P) × M + H + S

where:
*E = Extra Points (points above the target score, or below if the target score is not hit)
*P = &quot;Petit au bout&quot; bonus (see below)
*M = Multiplier (1, 2, 4, or 6 depending on the taker&#x27;s bid level)
*H = Handful bonus (see below)
*S = Slam bonus (see below)

If the taker beats the target score, this hand score is deducted from the score of each defender. If the taker misses the target score, this score is added to the score of each defender. The opposite of the sum of the defenders&#x27; gain or loss is then added to or deducted from the taker&#x27;s score to balance the scores; with four players, the taker will gain or lose three times the hand score depending on whether the taker made or missed the contract. The sum of all scores for each hand, and thus the sum of the running totals after each hand, should be zero.

For example, a Garde Sans bid with a simple handful won by player A by a margin of 12 points gives the following hand score: = 168 points. This score is deducted from the scores of all defenders and the sum of this loss is added to the taker&#x27;s score, hence the scorecard:
*A +504
*B −168
*C −168
*D −168

Some players prefer to round the scores to the nearest 10 points after each game, however care must be taken as the scores should still sum to zero. Rounding each of the above scores independently yields 500 − 170 − 170 − 170 = −10. If rounding is to be done, the defenders&#x27; scores should be rounded and the taker&#x27;s score adjusted accordingly. Doing so in the above example would make the taker&#x27;s score 510, thus it balances out.

This is not the only scoring method; the alternative is seen below.

====Soft shuffling====

After each round, the cards are gathered, cut by the previous dealer, and dealt by the person to the right of the previous dealer. The cards are not commonly shuffled other than the &quot;soft shuffling&quot; that occurs as a natural result of playing the cards. By not shuffling, groups of desirable cards are kept together such that one person generally has a favorable enough hand to open the bidding. With shuffling between deals it is unlikely that any one player will be willing to bid on the hand dealt; this leads to multiple redeals before a hand is actually played.

=== Bonuses ===

==== &quot;Misère&quot; ====
If a player&#x27;s hand contains no trumps or no court cards (roi, dame, cavalier, valet), the player can declare Misère, which gives the declarer 30 points and subtracts 10 from the other players scores. This bonus is a common house rule and is not considered &quot;official&quot; by the Fédération Française de Tarot for tournament purposes.

==== &quot;Poignée&quot; ====
If a player has 10 or more trumps in their hand, they can declare a single (10+), double (13+), or triple (15+) &quot;handful&quot; (&quot;poignée&quot;), right before playing their first card. A single handful adds 20 to the scoring. Doubles and triples add 40 and 60, respectively. The bonus is always added to the hand score, so if a player thinks that his or her side may not win, they might not want to declare a handful, so as not to give the other side points. The declaring player must show at least the number of trump cards for the level of the bonus declared. The Fool counts as a trump for the purposes of declaring handfuls, but if shown it gives information to other players as it usually means that the declaring player has no additional trumps. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.

==== &quot;Petit au bout&quot; ====
When the last trick contains the Petit (1 of trump), 10 points is added to or deducted from the hand score before multiplying. Whether it is added or subtracted depends on which would most benefit the side taking the trick with the &quot;Petit au bout&quot; (One at the End). Usually, when one side (taker or defenders) makes &quot;Petit au bout&quot; but the other side was successful in either making or breaking contract, the bonus is subtracted; when one side is successful in the contract and also makes &quot;Petit au bout&quot;, the bonus is added. If the side attempting the &quot;Petit au bout&quot; wins all the tricks, the player gets the &quot;petit au bout&quot; bonus if the Petit was played at the second to last trick (and won the trick) and the Fool was played at the last trick. This bonus is multiplied according to the contract; if the contract is Guard Without, the gain or loss for a single hand score is adjusted by 40 points one way or the other.

==== &quot;Chelem&quot; ====
To Slam (in French, &quot;chelem&quot;) is to take every trick in the round. &quot;Announced&quot; Slam (made while bidding in the auction) gains 400 points if made. It grants the taker the right (and obligation) to start the first trick. Otherwise, a non-announced Slam made by either the taker or the defenders gains 200 points. Failure to fulfill a pre-declared Slam costs the announcer 200 points. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract.

==== Petit Slam ====
&quot;Petit Slam&quot; is a bid to take every trick but three. It is, like the &quot;misère&quot;, unofficial. An unannounced Petit Slam is worth 150 points, while an announced slam can gain the taker 300 points or lose them 150 if they make or miss.

== Variants ==

=== Petit imprenable ===
In &quot;Petit imprenable&quot; (&quot;untouchable Petit&quot;), a player who has no trump except the Petit can still play, but the Petit is played like the Fool; if it does not take the trick, it is given back to its owner in exchange for a half-point card.

=== &quot;Petit sec&quot; ===
In &quot;Petit sec&quot; (&quot;dry Petit&quot;), a player who has the Petit but no other trump nor the Fool must announce this; the hand is voided and this round will be redealt by the next dealer. Common house rules also allow a player to declare a &quot;maldonne&quot; if their hand has no trumps, or fewer than a given number of combined trumps and face cards.

=== Three-player variant ===
The dog consists of six cards, each hand of 24 cards, dealt in packets of three. 13 trumps are needed for a single handful, 15 for a double handful, 18 for a triple.

=== Five-player variant ===
The dog consists of three cards, each hand of 15 cards, dealt in packets of three. 8 trumps are needed for a single handful, 10 for a double, 13 for a triple. Before calling the dog and scoring the three cards, the taker calls the King of any suit. Whoever has that King becomes the taker&#x27;s partner, and plays with the taker against the other players. If the taker has all four kings, a queen must be called. If the taker has all four kings and all four queens, a knight must be called. A taker with all kings, queens and knights must play alone.

In the Austrian tarot game of Königrufen, this king-calling mechanism is used so that four-player play two against two.

The King is called &quot;before&quot; anything is done with the dog; therefore, the taker may call a King that is in the dog. In this case, the taker plays alone; having effectively called him- or herself as partner if the dog&#x27;s cards are to be integrated into the hand, and in any case no other player has that King in hand.

In scoring, the taker&#x27;s partner gets one &quot;hand score&quot; added to or deducted if the taker makes or misses the contract. So, if taker beats the target score, each defender loses the hand score, the partner gains the hand score, and the taker gets twice the hand score. If the taker misses, the gains and losses are reversed.

=== Higher &quot;Garde Contre&quot; ===
A popular variant is setting the multiplier for the Garde Contre to 8 instead of 6.

=== &quot;Parole&quot; bid ===
In some social games, and in order to avoid abandoned deals and the redistribution of cards, it is possible to have a bid of &quot;Parole&quot;: the player does not commit to a contract but reserves judgment until a second round of bidding. Depending on the variants, this allows you to freely choose a bid from &quot;Prise&quot; to &quot;Garde Contre&quot;, or just a &quot;Prise&quot;. This variant is not accepted in tournaments.

=== &quot;Pousse&quot; contract ===
In some regions, there is a &quot;Pousse&quot; between the &quot;Petite&quot; and the &quot;Garde&quot;. Instead of having multipliers, the contracts are then worth fixed amounts of 10, 20, 40, 80 or 160 points. In this case, the single &quot;Prise&quot; is called the &quot;Petite&quot; (the player says in this case &quot;Petite&quot;). In this variant the player does not say &quot;I&quot; in the other bids, simply saying &quot;&quot;garde&quot; or &quot;pousse&quot;&quot; for example. When a player has made a bid and another player outbids, the first player can in turn outbid or leave i.e. it is bidding with immediate hold.

== Strategy ==
=== Evaluating one&#x27;s hand ===
As a guide to bidding, a player can reckon points for various features of the cards held, judging the bid according to the total number of points.
Each range of point totals suggests a different bid:
:less than 40 points: Passe (no bid)
:40 to 55 points: Prise
:56 to 70 points: Garde
:71 to 80 points: Garde Sans
:80+ points: Garde Contre

=== Getting the Petit ===
It is essential to try to get the Petit if one can. In a 5-player game, if the taker has the 21 of trump, it should always be played so the partner can secure the Petit if held. A taker with many trumps may embark on a &quot;chasse au petit&quot; (Petit hunt), trying to play trumps so that the Petit owner has no choice but to give it away.

=== Observation ===
Every player should know which suits have been played, and which are still to be played. It is useful to count how many trumps, and what kings, have been played.

=== Statistics ===

==== Distribution of suits ====
The following table shows the maximum number of suits and trumps for a Defender for 4 players.
Example: &quot;Suppose the taker has 8 hearts, thus the Defenders have 6 hearts. In 5.3% of the cases, one Defender has 5 or more hearts. Notice that the sum from any column is 100%. If the taker has 9 trumps, thus the Defense has 12 trumps. There is a 1.1% probability that one Defender has 9 or more trumps&quot;.

=== Dog&#x27;s cards ===
This applies to 4 players and 6-card dog.

Example: &quot;Albert is the taker and has no queen; he thus has a 30.5% chance of getting a queen in the dog, 4.4% of two queens. If Florence is the taker and has 8 diamonds, there are 14-8=6 diamonds left, so she has a 51.6% chance of not getting any diamond in the dog at all. If Bertrand is the taker and has 7 trumps, there are 21-7=14 trumps left, so he has a 43% chance of getting 2 or more trumps&quot;.

== Signals ==
The Fédération Française de Tarot has developed a system of conventional leads that lets partners communicate the value and number of the cards in hand. An outline of the system follows.

At the outset (indicated by 1 card)

*In a suit:
: A card from Ace to 5 signals that the player holds a major honour (King-Queen).
: A card higher than the 5 signals that the player does not hold such an honour.

*In trumps:
: An odd trump signals possession of at least 7 trumps, and requests that partner play trumps.
: An even trump played at the beginning of part announces possession of fewer than 7 trumps.

With the Supply (indicated by 2 cards)

*Suit played by the attacker:
: Order going down: behavior 5th in the suit invites to play trump (attention not to have the Petit in hand).
: The Excuse on starts attacker with the first or with the second turn promises the behavior

*Suit played by defender:
: Two cards of the same suit played in descending order signal that the player held a doubleton in this suit. The player&#x27;s partner is implicitly expected to continue playing this suit so that the player can overtrump.

When a player indicates the strength of his or her hand by playing a king or an odd trump, it imposes a line of play to which the partners are duty bound to adhere.

: Excuse at the first round of trumps: Player demands an end to trumps.

<doc id="768318" wikidata="Q845630" url="?curid=768318" title="239 (number)">
<text>239 (two hundred [and] thirty-nine) is the natural number following 238 and preceding 240.
==Properties==
239 is a prime number. The next is 241, with which it forms a pair of twin primes; hence, it is also a Chen prime. 239 is a Sophie Germain prime and a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime. It is an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form 3&quot;n&quot; − 1 (with no exponentiation implied). 239 is also a happy number.

239 is the smallest positive integer &quot;d&quot; such that the imaginary quadratic field Q() has class number = 15.
==HAKMEM entry==
HAKMEM (incidentally AI memo 239 of the MIT AI Lab) included an item on the properties of 239, including these:
* When expressing 239 as a sum of square numbers, 4 squares are required, which is the maximum that any integer can require; it also needs the maximum number (9) of positive cubes (23 is the only other such integer), and the maximum number (19) of fourth powers.
* 239/169 is a convergent of the simple continued fraction of the square root of 2, so that 2392 = 2 · 1692 − 1.
* Related to the above, = 45°.
* 239 · 4649 = 1111111, so 1/239 = 0.0041841 repeating, with period 7.
* 239 can be written as &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; − 1 for &quot;b&quot; = 2, 3, and 4, a fact evidenced by its binary representation 11101111, ternary representation 22212, and quaternary representation 3233.
* There are 239 primes &lt; 1500.
* 239 is the largest integer &quot;n&quot; whose factorial can be written as the product of distinct factors between &quot;n&quot; + 1 and 2&quot;n&quot;, both included.
* The only solutions of the Diophantine equation &quot;y&quot;2 + 1 = 2&quot;x&quot;4 in positive integers are (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = (1, 1) or (13, 239).

<doc id="768322" wikidata="Q1571403" url="?curid=768322" title="Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena">
<text>The Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was a multi-purpose arena at Exposition Park, in the University Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. It was located next to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and just south of the campus of the University of Southern California, which managed and operated both venues under a master lease agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission. The arena was closed in April 2016, and was demolished in September of that same year. It was replaced with BMO Stadium, home of Major League Soccer&#x27;s Los Angeles FC, which opened in 2018.

==History==
The arena was opened by Vice President Richard Nixon on July 4, 1959, and its first event followed four days later, a bantamweight title fight between José Becerra and Alphonse Halimi on July 8. It became a companion facility to the adjacent Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

The venue was the home court of the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA from October 1960 to December 1967, the Los Angeles Clippers also of the NBA from 1984 to 1999, and the home ice of the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL from October to December 1967 during their inaugural 1967–68 season. It was the home for college basketball for the USC Trojans from 1959 to 2006 and the UCLA Bruins from 1959 to 1965 and again as a temporary home in the 2011–2012 season. It was also the home of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association&#x27;s National Finals Rodeo from 1962 to 1964. It also hosted the Los Angeles Aztecs of the NASL who played one season of indoor soccer there (1980–81), the Los Angeles Blades of the Western Hockey League from 1961 to 1967, the Los Angeles Sharks of the WHA from 1972 to 1974, the Los Angeles Cobras of the AFL in 1988, and the original Los Angeles Stars of the ABA from 1968 to 1970. The arena played host to the top indoor track athletics meet on the West Coast, the annual Los Angeles Invitational track meet (frequently called the &quot;Sunkist Invitational&quot;, with title sponsorship by Sunkist Growers, Incorporated), from 1960 until the event&#x27;s demise in 2004.

The arena hosted the 1968 and 1972 NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four, the 1992 NCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Final Four, the 1963 NBA All-Star Game, Game 6 of the 1970 ABA Finals, and the boxing competitions during the 1984 Summer Olympics. In addition to hosting the final portion of WrestleMania 2 in 1986, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena also hosted WrestleMania VII in 1991 as well as other WWE events. The arena hosted When Worlds Collide, a 1994 joint card between the Mexican lucha libre promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and WCW (which normally called the Great Western Forum home until they, too, moved to Staples Center) that is credited with introducing the lucha style to English-speaking audiences in the U.S.

After then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling turned down an agreement to re-locate the franchise permanently to Anaheim&#x27;s Arrowhead Pond (now Honda Center) in 1996, the Coliseum Commission had discussions to build an on-site replacement for the Sports Arena. Plans included a seating capacity of 18,000 for basketball, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site practice facility for the Clippers. However, as a new Downtown Los Angeles sports and entertainment arena was being planned and eventually built (Staples Center) two miles north along Figueroa Street, the Coliseum Commission scuttled plans for a Sports Arena replacement, and as a result, the Clippers became one of the original tenants at the new downtown arena. There were also similar plans years earlier, in 1989, as Sterling had discussions with then-Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley and then-Coliseum Commission president (and eventual Bradley mayoral successor) Richard Riordan about a Sports Arena replacement; Sterling threatened to leave the Sports Arena and move elsewhere in the Los Angeles region if plans did not come together.

After the Trojans departed to the new Galen Center in 2006, the arena assumed a lower profile. The arena still continued to hold high school basketball championships, as well as concerts and conventions. The UCLA men&#x27;s basketball team returned to the arena to play a majority of their home games at the Sports Arena during the 2011–12 season while Pauley Pavilion underwent renovation.

===2010s===

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission embarked on a seismic retrofit, designed to bring the Sports Arena up to 21st century seismic standards. Bentley Management Group was hired as the project manager for the Seismic Bracing Remodel. In order to reinforce the existing structure, a series of steel braced frames were connected to the existing concrete structural system at both the arena and loge levels of the building. To provide a solid footing for these steel frames, portions of the arena floor had to be excavated, then reinforced to provide extra strength. Once the steel frames were fitted and incorporated into the existing structure between existing support columns, concrete was then re-poured into the area. The original crown of the arena, one of its most distinguishing characteristics, was the countless small ceramic tiles, each measuring no more than a square inch in width. A multitude of the crown&#x27;s tiles were loosening and many others were discolored. In order to remedy this, a new crown was designed, this time using individual sections of EIFS (Exterior insulation finishing system), which offered the decided advantages of better durability, easier maintenance and improved thermal characteristics. A foundation surface was applied directly over the existing tiles, in order to seal the crown and give the new surface something to adhere to. Once the structural work was finished, the walls, ceilings, doors, floors and other areas involved in the modification had to be put back together. Throughout the entire project, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena remained open for business. The result was a brand-new crown around the exterior of the building, as well as a new terrazzo floor on the concourse level.

During an open session meeting on July 17, 2013, the Coliseum Commission authorized the amendment to the existing USC-Coliseum Commission Lease for the operation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 25, 2013, the Coliseum Commission and USC executed this new long-term master lease agreement. It became effective on July 29, 2013, and the Commission transferred day-to-day management and financial responsibilities for the Coliseum and Sports Arena to USC. This included the rehiring by USC, on a fixed term basis, of the Coliseum/Sports Arena employees who had been working for the commission the previous day. For most of the former Coliseum Commission employees, the fixed term of their employment would be short-lived, ending 10 months later on May 30, 2014.

===Closure and replacement===
The Sports Arena was demolished in order to replace it with a more in-demand facility — a soccer-specific stadium that would house an MLS team. On May 18, 2015, Los Angeles Football Club announced its intentions to build a privately funded 22,000-seat soccer-specific stadium at the site for $250 million. The stadium would be completed by 2018.
From March 15 to 19, 2016, Bruce Springsteen performed a series of three sold-out concerts, the last events held in the arena. When he introduced his song &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; during the last concert, he opened by saying &quot;We gotta play this one for the old building... We&#x27;re gonna miss this place, it&#x27;s a great place to play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; The arena closed after the last concert. Demolition began in September 2016 for the new stadium development. After a groundbreaking for the new stadium, the arena was demolished between August and October 2016. BMO Stadium now stands in the old Sports Arena footprint.

==The arena==
The arena underwent major renovations to bring it up to 21st century seismic standards and was well maintained. There were four fully equipped team rooms, two smaller rooms for officials, and two private dressing rooms for individual performers. There were two additional meeting rooms on site which could be used for administrative or hospitality functions.

The floor area comprised a space (), affording the largest standing floor capacity of any arena in the area. There was a vertical clearance. The arena has a unique, expansive floor-level footprint of nearly and on the concourse level, allowing the installation of any needed display, food or other programming requirements. There was an enormous load-in ramp at the west side of the arena with a wide entry. Print, radio and television media was serviced on each side of the arena by installation of any kind of portable facilities. Five permanent TV locations were sited on the concourse level. In addition, a catwalk was suspended from the ceiling and circled the arena for cameras or spotlights.

Spectators could reach arena level seating area either by a circulatory ramp on the southwest side of the building or by a stairway located next to the north doors. There were also escalators located at the southwest and northeast sides of the building. The Sports Arena was the first NBA arena to feature a rotating billboard at courtside, which also acted as the scorer&#x27;s table. Rotating billboards eventually became standard at all NBA arenas until the mid-2000s, when LED billboard/scorer&#x27;s tables were introduced.

Spectator amenities included a full-service main ticket office, a secondary box office and 2 portable booths, 6 permanent concession stands, and a first-aid station. A club and restaurant were located on the arena level of the facility. A number of operational improvements had been made to enhance accessibility for the handicapped, including the installation of 14 additional handicapped parking stalls, hand rails on both sides of the pedestrian ramp leading to the floor level seating, handicapped accessible drinking fountains, an Assistive Listening System to aid the hearing impaired, conversion of restroom facilities, dressing rooms and bathroom fixtures for the handicapped, and increased informational signage. Event presentation was augmented by a four-sided overhead scoreboard with several auxiliary boards.

===Seating capacity===
The arena seated up to 16,740 for boxing/wrestling, and 14,546 for hockey. There were 12,389 fixed upper-level, theater-type seats, and floor-level seating which could be configured by sport. The seating capacity for basketball changed over the years:

The team was owned by Nick Mileti, who had been the founder of the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers, and also owned Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cleveland Indians. He had also owned the nine-time American Hockey League champion Cleveland Barons, but moved them to Jacksonville, Florida to make room for the Crusaders. The first coach for the Crusaders was Bill Needham, a mainstay of the Barons. Needham coached the Crusaders to winning records in the first two seasons, but failed to advance past the second playoff round. In the 1974–75 season, John Hanna took over as coach, to be replaced mid-season by Jack Vivian. Cleveland finished second in the east division despite a losing record, but fell in the first round of the playoffs. Johnny Wilson led the team for its final season, also losing in the first round of the post-season.

Mileti sold the team to Jay White in 1975, but White sold it back to Mileti in 1976. However, not long after Mileti closed on his repurchase, the National Hockey League&#x27;s California Golden Seals moved to Cleveland and became the Cleveland Barons. Mileti knew he could not hope to compete with an NHL team and decided to move the Crusaders elsewhere.

Initially, the team was going to relocate to South Florida and become the Florida Breakers, going far enough to have a logo designed. After the proposed move fell through, the Crusaders relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota, becoming the second incarnation of the Minnesota Fighting Saints.

==Players==

Gary Jarrett was the Crusaders top scorer in their four seasons, playing in 298 games, scoring 104 goals, 119 assists, totalling 223 points. Gerry Pinder played the most games in a Crusader uniform, 304 in total. Other notable Crusaders players included Paul Shmyr (538 penalty minutes in four seasons), netminder Gerry Cheevers (99 wins in four seasons), and defenseman Wayne Hillman.

The last active Crusaders player in major professional hockey was Paul Baxter, who last played the 1986-87 NHL season.

<text>A buckle or clasp is a device used for fastening two loose ends, with one end attached to it and the other held by a catch in a secure but adjustable manner. Often taken for granted, the invention of the buckle was indispensable in securing two ends before the invention of the zipper. The basic buckle frame comes in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the intended use and fashion of the era. Buckles are as much in use today as they have been in the past: used for much more than just securing one&#x27;s belt, instead they are one of the most dependable devices in securing a range of items.

The word &quot;buckle&quot; enters Middle English via Old French and the Latin &quot;buccula&quot; or &quot;cheek-strap,&quot; as for a helmet. Some of the earliest buckles known are those used by Roman soldiers to strap their body armor together and prominently on the balteus and cingulum. Made out of bronze and expensive, these buckles were purely functional for their strength and durability - vital to the individual soldier. The baldric was a later belt worn diagonally over the right shoulder down to the waist at the left carrying the sword, and its buckle therefore was as important as that on a Roman soldier’s armor.

Bronze Roman buckles cames in various types. Not only used for practical purposes, these buckles were also decorated. A Type I Roman buckle was a “buckle-plate” either decorated or plain and consisted of geometric ornaments. Type IA Roman buckles were similar to Type I buckles but differed by being long and narrow, made of double sheet metal, and attached to small D-shaped buckles (primarily had dolphin-heads as decorations). Type IB “buckle-loops” were even more similar to Type IA buckles, only difference being that instead of dolphin-heads, they were adorned with horse-heads. There were also Type II buckles (Type IIA and Type IIB) used by Romans, but all types of Roman buckles could have served purposes for simple clothing as well, and predominantly, as a military purpose.

Aside from the practical use found in Roman buckles, Scythian and Sarmatian buckles incorporated animal motifs that were characteristic to their respective decorative arts. These motifs often represented animals engaged in mortal combat. These motifs were imported by many Germanic peoples and the belt buckles were evident in the graves of the Franks and Burgundies. And throughout the Middle Ages, the buckle was used mostly for ornamentation until the second half of the 14th century where the knightly belt and buckle took on its most splendid form.

Buckles remained exclusively for the wealthy until the 15th century where improved manufacturing techniques made it possible to easily produce a cheaper molded item available to the general population.

==Components==

The buckle essentially consists of four main components: the frame, chape, bar, and prong. The oldest Roman buckles are of a simple D-shaped frame, in which the prong or tongue extends from one side to the other. In the 14th century, buckles with a double-loop or &quot;8&quot;-shaped frame emerged. The prongs of these buckles attach to the center post. The appearance of multi-part buckles with chapes and removable pins, which were commonly found on shoes, occurred in the 17th century.

===Frame===
The frame is the most visible part of the buckle and holds the other parts of the buckle together. Buckle frames come in various shapes, sizes, and decorations. The shape of the frame could be a plain square or rectangle, but may be oval or made into a circular shape. A reverse curve of the frame indicated that the whole buckle was intended to be used for securing a thick material, such as leather. This reverse curve shape made it easier to thread the intended thick material end over the bar. But the shape of the frame is not limited to simply squares and ovals, the decoration of the frame itself defines the shape it will turn out to be. Since the frame is the largest part of the buckle, any and all decorations are placed on it. Decorations range from wedged shapes, picture references to people and animals, and insignia of a desired organization.

The part of the frame that strap goes through prior to putting the tongue/prong through the hole is often referred to as the &#x27;end bar&#x27;. The &#x27;center bar&#x27; holds the tongue and the part (if present) that holds the tip of the strap in place is called the &#x27;keeper&#x27; or &#x27;keeper bar&#x27; these terms are used when additional information is needed to describe a buckle for measurements or design. Note that if a separate piece of leather or metal is attached to the strap for holding the tip of the belt/strap in place that is sometimes also called a &#x27;keeper&#x27;.

===Chape===
Chapes or &quot;caps&quot; of various designs could be fitted to the bar to enable one strap end to be secured before fastening the other, adjustable end. This made buckles easily removable and interchangeable, leading to a significant advantage since buckles were expensive. Unfortunately, the teeth or spikes on the semi-circular chapes damaged the straps or belts, making frequent repairs of the material necessary. Buckles fitted with &quot;T&quot;-, anchor-, or spade-shaped chapes avoided this problem but needed a slotted end in the belt to accommodate them.

The belt buckle chapes are frequently made in a form of a plate, thus the name buckle plate.

===Prong===
The prong (also named pin) is typically made out of steel or other types of metal. In conventional belts, the prong fits through the buckle to secure the material at a pre-set length.

The prong is usually referred to as the tongue of the buckle in America, as in &#x27;lock-tongued buckle&#x27;. Prong is only used when the tongue is permanently fixed in position.

===Bar===
The bar serves to hold the chape and prong to the frame. When prongs and chapes are removed from the buckle design, the buckle incorporated a movable bar relying on the tension of the adjusted belt to keep it in place.

==Materials==

=== Metal===

The first known buckles to be used were made out of bronze for their strength and durability for military usage.

For the last few hundred years, buckles have been made from brass (an alloy of copper and zinc). In the 18th century, brass buckles incorporated iron bars, chapes, and prongs due to the parts being made by different manufactures. Silver was also used in buckle manufacturing for its malleability and for being strong and durable with an attractive shine. White metal, any bright metallic compound, was also used in all styles of buckles; however, if iron was present, rust will form if it is allowed to be exposed and remain in damp conditions.

===Pearl===
Pearl buckles have been made from pearly shells and usually for ladies’ dresses. Since a reasonable size flat surface was needed to make a buckle, oyster was commonly used to make these types of buckles. The quality and color of course vary, ranging from layers of yellow and white to brown or grey.

===Wood===
When preferred materials were scarce during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the two World Wars, buckles became a low priority and manufactures needed to find ways to continue to produce them cheaply. Makers turned to wood as a cheap alternative since it was easily worked by hand or simple machinery by impressing the designs onto the wood. But there were problems using wood. Any attempt to brighten the wood’s dull appearance with painted designs or plasterwork embellishments immediately came off if the buckle were to be washed.

===Leather===
Buckles were not entirely made out of leather because a frame and bar of leather would not be substantial enough to carry a prong or the full weight of the belt and anything the belt and buckle intend to support. However, leather (or dyed suede, more common to match a lady’s garment color) was used more as a “cover-up” for cheap materials to create a product worthy of buying.

===Glass===
Buckles were not made out of glass; rather the glass was used as a decorative feature that covered the entire frame of a metal buckle. One method of creating glass buckles was gluing individual discs of glass to the metal frame. Another more intricate method was to set a wire into the back of a glass disc, and then threading the wire through a hole in the fretted frame of the buckle. The glass was further secured by either bending it over the back of the frame or splayed out like a rivet.

===Polymers===
Celluloid, a type of thermoplastic invented in 1869, was used sparingly and only for decoration until after World War I where it began to be produced on a wider commercial scale. After World War II, the chemical industry saw a great expansion where Celluloid and other plastics such as Casein and Bakelite formed the basis of the buckle-making industry. Many thermoplastic polymers such as nylon are now used in snap-fit buckles for a wide variety of applications.

==Types==

=== Clasp vs. buckle ===

Although any device that serves to secure two loose ends is casually called a buckle, if it consists of two separate pieces with one for a hook and the other for a loop, it should be called a clasp. Clasps became increasingly popular at the turn of the 19th century with one clear disadvantage: since each belt end was fixed to each clasp piece, the size of the belt was typically not adjustable unless an elastic panel was inserted.

===Buckle trim or slide===

A buckle without a chape or prongs is called a buckle trim or slide. It may have been designed this particular way or it may have lost its prongs through continuous use. This type was frequently used in home dress-making (belt end being secured with the simple hook-and-eye) and was purely used for decoration for items such as shoe fronts to conceal unattractive elastic fitting.

===Conventional (belt) buckle===
The belt buckle is the conventional buckle with a frame, bar and prong gives the most reliable and easy-to-use closure for a belt. It is not meant, by design, to offer much space for decoration, but for its time-tested reliability.

===Side release buckle===

A conventional snap-fit buckle that is formed by a &quot;male&quot; buckle member—the hook end—and a &quot;female&quot; buckle member—the insertion end. The male buckle member consists of a center rod and two spring prongs equally spaced from the center rod. The two spring arms each have a retaining block that terminates at the front end. The female buckle member has a front open side and two side holes which hold and secure the two spring arms of the male buckle member. This sort of buckle may be found connecting many strapped items such as pet harnesses, safety harnesses, personal flotation jackets, fanny packs and other bags, belts, gun slings, and boots. It is also known as the &quot;parachute buckle&quot;. They are often used in conjunction with tri-glide slides.
=== Western and cowboy (belt) buckles ===

In the United States, during the American Civil War of the 1860s, some members of the military wore brass belt buckles. These buckles had a pin that was inserted directly into the belt, thus not having any moving parts. In 1920, this type of buckle was awarded to winners of professional rodeo contests at the San Francisco Cow Palace in California. Throughout the 1920s and later, they were used as trophies awarded to champions of bull riding, barrel racing, steer roping, bronc riding and other rodeo skill competitions. 

By the 1950s, Hollywood Westerns featured cowboys wearing large, shiny belt buckles and this influenced country/western fashion. During the 1990s, country/western dance competitions mirrored the practice by awarding championship buckles to their dance champions.

Modern-day western belt buckles are commonly made of silver, brass, pewter, zinc alloy, or stainless steel.

<doc id="768333" wikidata="Q1190614" url="?curid=768333" title="Port Authority Bus Terminal">
<text>The Port Authority Bus Terminal (colloquially known as the Port Authority and by its acronym PABT) is a bus terminal located in Manhattan in New York City. It is the busiest bus terminal in the world by volume of traffic, serving about 8,000 buses and 225,000 people on an average weekday and more than 65 million people a year.

The terminal is located in Midtown Manhattan at 625 Eighth Avenue between 40th Street and 42nd Street, one block east of the Lincoln Tunnel and one block west of Times Square. It is one of three bus terminals operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ); the other two are George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Upper Manhattan and Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City.

PABT serves as a terminus and departure point for commuter routes as well as for long-distance intercity bus service and is a major transit hub for residents of New Jersey. It has 223 departure gates and 1,250 car parking spaces, as well as commercial and retail space. In 2011, there were more than 2.263 million bus departures from the terminal.

Opened in 1950, the terminal was built to consolidate several private terminals spread across Midtown Manhattan. A second wing, extending to 42nd Street, was added in 1979. Since then, the terminal has reached peak hour capacity, leading to congestion and overflow on local streets. It does not allow for layover parking; as such, buses must either use local streets and parking lots or deadhead through the tunnel. PANYNJ has been unsuccessful in its attempts to expand passenger facilities through public private partnership, and in 2011 it delayed construction of a bus depot annex, citing budgetary constraints. After considering several plans to relocate the terminal, the PANYNJ released plans in 2021 to reconstruct the terminal on the same site, with layover facilities.

==History==

Before PABT was constructed, there were several terminals scattered throughout Midtown Manhattan, some of which were part of hotels. The Federal Writers Project&#x27;s 1940 publication of &quot;New York: A Guide to the Empire State&quot; lists the All American Bus Depot on West 42nd, the Consolidated Bus Terminal on West 41st, and the Hotel Astor Bus Terminal on West 45th. The Dixie Bus Center on 42nd Street, located on the ground floor of the Dixie Hotel, opened in 1930 and operated until 1959.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had coach service aboard a ferry to Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City that ran from an elegant bus terminal with a revolving bus platform in the Chanin Building at 42nd and Lexington. Greyhound Lines had its own facility adjacent to Pennsylvania Station and did not move into the Port Authority Bus Terminal until May 1963, at which time all long-distance bus service to the city was consolidated at the terminal.

=== Development ===
==== Planning ====
The Lincoln Tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey opened in 1937. Within a year and a half of the tunnel&#x27;s opening, five companies were operating 600 interstate bus trips through the tunnel every day. The city opposed letting buses go through Midtown Manhattan because they caused congestion. A large bus terminal near the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel was first mandated in December 1939, after the city announced that it would ban commuter buses from driving into congested parts of Midtown. The ban was supposed to go into effect in January 1941, but New York Supreme Court Justice John E. McGeehan blocked La Guardia&#x27;s proposed bus ban on the grounds that it was unreasonable.

In July 1940, at the request of New York City mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Port of New York Authority started conducting a survey into the causes and effects of intercity and commuter bus traffic in Manhattan. That December, Times Square Terminal Inc. filed an application to build and operate a commuter bus terminal from 41st to 42nd Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, adjacent to the McGraw-Hill Building on land owned by the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. According to projections at the time, the $4 million terminal could be completed within nine months. Manhattan Borough President Stanley M. Isaacs proposed building a short $600,000 tube between the Lincoln Tunnel and the new terminal. The city approved the construction of the new terminal and connecting tunnel in January 1941.

Plans for a bus terminal were delayed because of World War II, which diverted resources from most projects that were not directly involved in the war effort. In June 1944, the New York state government allocated $180,000 to the Port of New York Authority for studying the feasibility of constructing a bus terminal in Midtown Manhattan. Early the next year, plans for a mid-Manhattan bus terminal were presented to the different bus companies. While most major bus lines agreed to the plan, Greyhound was already planning on expanding its then terminal near Penn Station. Greyhound initially opposed the terminal but withdrew its opposition in late 1947.

==== Construction ====
The New York City Board of Estimate approved the construction of the new terminal in January 1947. The terminal was to be built one block south of the aborted Times Square Terminal Inc. site, on the block bounded by 40th and 41st Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. The Port of New York Authority began acquiring land for the terminal two months later. To finance the terminal&#x27;s construction, the agency issued $16.3 million in bonds in July 1947. Plans for the structural design were revised substantially in March 1948, when the Port of New York Authority added a 500-spot parking lot on the terminal&#x27;s roof, to be accessed via a series of ramps. The last industrial tenant on the future terminal&#x27;s site moved away the following month, and the agency began relocating the first of 450 displaced families in November 1948.

Walter McQuade designed the terminal, with Vincent Marchesani as the assistant architect. The Port of New York Authority hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for the terminal on January 27, 1949, at which point half of the site had been cleared. At the same time, the agency began soliciting bids from concessionaires for the terminal&#x27;s 50 stores. By the middle of the year, the agency had received 500 bids from concessionaires. The first steel beams for the new bus terminal were installed in November 1949, and Turner Construction received a contract the next month to build the terminal&#x27;s superstructure for approximately $9.2 million. The steel framework for the new terminal topped out during March 1950. The terminal&#x27;s construction was delayed slightly by a labor strike in the middle of that year. Despite this, the terminal was substantially complete by November 1, 1950. The project had employed 1,055 men and used 1.53 million bricks and of concrete.

===Original terminal===

The original Mid-Manhattan Bus Terminal (now PABT&#x27;s South Wing), built in the International Style, was opened on December 15, 1950. The four-story terminal measured and was tall, with a 500-space parking lot and 50 stores. The ground level contained 40 slips for long-haul buses, as well as an auxiliary platform with space for 15 more buses. The second level was the main concourse and contained ticket offices, waiting rooms, baggage check, restaurants, shops, a 300-seat newsreel theater, and escalators to other levels. The third story was the suburban concourse, which was divided into three sections and contained 72 loading slips and 15 unloading slips. The fourth story was for short-haul buses. A system of pipes was embedded into the reinforced-concrete ramps leading to the terminal, keeping the ramps free of ice. The Port of New York Authority had also proposed a heliport on the roof during the terminal&#x27;s construction, and the agency had authorized the construction of a ramp to the 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue subway station just before the terminal opened.

During its first year, the Port Authority Bus Terminal accommodated 40 million passengers; the terminal&#x27;s construction was credited with diverting 5,000 buses per day from street-level bus stops. The terminal had replaced a series of coffee shops frequented by the elderly; after the coffee shops had been demolished, patrons of these establishments began meeting at the terminal instead. The terminal&#x27;s rooftop garage was initially mostly empty, prompting the garage&#x27;s operators to allow trucks to park there. By mid-1951, the garage was frequently fully occupied and was profitable. In the terminal&#x27;s early years, the Port of New York Authority constantly cleaned the terminal, scrubbing the floor every night. Despite the large numbers of passengers who used the terminal, it recorded a net loss during its first five years, in part due to high operating expenses, debt charges, and interest costs.

=== Expansions and modifications ===

==== First expansion ====
In September 1959, the Port of New York Authority announced that it would spend $19 million to increase the bus terminal&#x27;s capacity by 50 percent. The plans involved converting the existing parking lot atop the building with 25 spaces for long-haul buses and 32 spaces for short-haul buses. In addition, a 1,000-space parking lot would be built above the existing roof. That December, the Port of New York Authority approved $24 million for the expansion of the terminal and for the widening of several ramps leading from the terminal to the Lincoln Tunnel. Construction of the expansion took place during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions to bus service. As part of an experiment in 1960, the Port of New York Authority installed a canopy above one of the loading slips to shield commuters from buses&#x27; emissions. The first of 30 &quot;legs&quot; supporting the new parking lot were installed in November 1960, and the existing parking lot was closed the following March.

The expansion topped out in June 1961, and a bridge connecting the expanded terminal with the Lincoln Tunnel was installed two months later. The Port of New York Authority sold $25 million in bonds for the expansions of the Port Authority Bus Terminal and George Washington Bridge in January 1962. The new ramps to the Lincoln Tunnel were finished the next month. The first 300 spaces in the new parking lot opened in April 1962, and the rest of the parking lot was opened in stages over the next two months. The new loading slips were opened in several stages and were in full operation by April 1963.

==== Decline ====
As early as the mid-1960s, the Port Authority Bus Terminal had gained a reputation as a &quot;derelict&#x27;s haven&quot;, especially at night, when dozens of homeless persons slept in the terminal. Following a &quot;New York Times&quot; report about the large homeless populations in the terminal, the PANYNJ began stationing additional officers there in January 1967 to deter homeless people from sleeping there. The PANYNJ also added a CCTV system in 1966 in an attempt to reduce crime. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1969 that hustlers frequently harassed the terminal&#x27;s passengers; at the time, the Port Authority Police Department arrested 130 people per month.

By the early 1970s, the PANYNJ had redecorated some of the terminal&#x27;s spaces, adding glass enclosures and rubber trees in an attempt to discourage loiterers. The PANYNJ also built a coffeehouse in late 1971 for elderly residents of the area who frequented the terminal, and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission installed a taxi-dispatch system at the terminal in 1972. Meanwhile, the terminal still accommodated an average of 250,000 passengers daily by 1975, even as the number of buses traveling to the terminal had started to decline in 1968. Hustlers, pimps, prostitutes, alcoholics, and the homeless still frequented the terminal, which also attracted runaway youth from other cities. The Port Authority Bus Terminal also recorded hundreds of crimes every year by the late 1970s; this was attributed in part to the &quot;lonely and derelict&quot; in the neighborhood.

In March 1975, a federal judge ruled that the PANYNJ &quot;was not competent to&quot; allocate loading space to the bus companies that used the terminal, since the agency had never properly studied traffic patterns at the terminal. The PANYNJ subsequently conducted a study of the terminal&#x27;s traffic, finding that the terminal handled between 750 and 800 buses during a typical morning, which carried a total of 35,000 passengers. The Interstate Commerce Commission began investigating overcrowding at the terminal that March after receiving numerous commuter complaints that the PANYNJ and bus operators had &quot;failed to provide safe and adequate service&quot;. After the PANYNJ announced the next month that it would build an annex north of the original terminal, the ICC canceled a public hearing for its overcrowding investigation. One of the operators using the terminal, Trailways, began a rent strike in 1977, complaining that the terminal was dilapidated and that rent at the terminal was far too high. Trailways quickly ended its rent strike under threat of eviction, but the company criticized the terminal&#x27;s safety after two people were killed there in mid-1978.

==== Northern annex ====
Private developer Irving Maidman had proposed erecting a second bus terminal just north of the existing terminal in 1956. The PANYNJ first considered expanding the bus station northward to 42nd Street as early as January 1965; the New York City Planning Commission endorsed the plan, which was not carried out at that time. The PANYNJ announced plans in 1970 to expand its terminal northward and build an office tower above the north annex. The annex would have cost $80 million, while the skyscraper above it would have cost $50 million. PANYNJ officials hoped the new annex would alleviate traffic on Eighth Avenue, which was frequently congested because of double-parking taxis. Plans for the annex were delayed for several years because of disputes between the PANYNJ and the bus companies using the terminal. The PANYNJ claimed that the bus companies had refused to pay higher fees, but unnamed sources affiliated with the bus companies said the construction of the World Trade Center had used up the agency&#x27;s money.

The expansion was delayed until May 1975, when PANYNJ chairman William J. Ronan announced that the expansion would begin that September at a cost of $137.5 million. The project was to involve the replacement of the original terminal&#x27;s curved facade with a glass curtain wall; the construction of a new wing with four above-ground concourses and one basement; improved access to the subway; and a tunnel connecting with the Lincoln Tunnel. The project also included replacing existing escalators. To raise money for the annex, the PANYNJ raised tolls by 50 percent on six bridges and tunnels that it operated between New York and New Jersey. That August, the PANYNJ allocated another $22 million for the terminal&#x27;s renovation. The additional funds were earmarked for renovating the main concourse, erecting glass enclosures around 24 platforms, adding entrances on Ninth Avenue, refurbishing the restrooms, and replacing the air-conditioning system.

Although bus traffic continued to decline during the late 1970s, the PANYNJ still wished to build the annex to alleviate congestion at the existing terminal. The facility handled 7,000 buses per day in 1977; as such, during rush hours, buses had seven minutes to unload and load all passengers. The North Wing was opened in 1979. This expansion increased capacity by 50 percent and included a new facade comprising 27 steel X-shaped trusses. Assessing the facade design in 2008, Virtualtourist listed the terminal as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Top 10 Ugliest Buildings and Monuments&quot;. The northern annex included 50 loading slips, with space for another 25 slips, as well as a arcade recessed from the 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue facades.

==== Later years ====
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the public considered the area around Times Square, including PABT, to be dangerous. In an attempt to alleviate fears of crime, the PANYNJ turned on some lights that had been switched off to save energy; cleaned the city-maintained sidewalk outside the terminal; and created designated zones for hustlers and advocacy groups. Crime increased after the north wing was completed, with 2,800 crimes being reported in 1979 and 3,300 crimes in 1983.

During 1997, the terminal was the subject of a study, coordinated by Professor Marcus Felson of Rutgers University, which identified strategic changes to the building&#x27;s design and area supervision with a view to reducing crime and other problems. In 2007, the South Wing underwent a seismic retrofit in a $52 million building code-compliance project to reinforce and stabilize it against earthquakes. In addition, architecture firm PKSB Architects was hired in 1995 to design a titanium facade, a canopy above the entrance, and stainless steel cladding around the terminal&#x27;s ramps and bridges. That project was completed in 2008.

===Further expansion proposals===

====Air rights====
The PANYNJ has attempted to further expand the terminal through public–private partnerships by leasing air rights over the North Wing. In 1999, a 35-story building, to be known as 7 Times Square, was proposed to be constructed over the North Wing and a golf driving range was to be constructed over the South Wing. However, the project was put on hold in 2001 due to a decline in the economy following the dot com bust.

Between 2000 and 2011, the PANYNJ worked with Vornado Realty Trust, which had partnered with the Lawrence Ruben Company. Plans for the tower were revived in April 2007. That November, the PANYNJ announced the terms of an agreement in which it would receive nearly $500 million in a lease arrangement for a new office tower that would also provide funds for additional terminal facilities. The new tower would include of commercial space in a new office tower, which was to use the vanity address 20 Times Square, the addition of of new retail space in the bus terminal, as well as 18 additional departure gates, accommodating 70 additional buses carrying up to 3,000 passengers per hour. New escalators would be installed to help move passengers more quickly between the gate area and the ground floor. Construction was expected to begin in 2009 or 2010, and take four years to complete. After an architectural competition, the PANYNJ selected the design by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Richard Rogers from Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners for a 45-story office tower with an overall height of . The agreement expired in August 2009, and in May 2010, Vornado was given a retroactive extension on the deadline to August 2011. In July 2011, Vornado announced they had found a new partner to partially finance the tower, but in November 2011, the new backers pulled out of the project.

In June 2014, the PANYNJ received a higher price than anticipated for the sale of nearby property, $115 million versus $100 million. The value of air rights above the terminal would be higher than previously appraised, thanks to rising property values in the area surrounding the terminal and an indication of the rising value air rights above the terminal. The agency had intentions to release a request for proposals for air-rights development in 2014–2015.

====West Side bus depot====

The Port Authority allows for limited layovers of buses, thus requiring companies to make other arrangements during off-peak hours and between trips. Many park on local streets or parking lots during the day, while others make a round-trip without passengers through the Lincoln Tunnel to use layover facilities in New Jersey. Bus layover parking on city streets is regulated by the NYDOT, which assigns locations throughout the city. In the vicinity of PABT, these are concentrated on the side streets between Ninth and Twelfth Avenues from 30th Street to 60th Street.

Various studies and news reports have concluded that there is a need for a new bus depot in Midtown. In a joint study by New York City and PANYNJ, it was determined that a preferred location for a bus depot was at Galvin Plaza located on 39th to 40th Streets between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. However, this proposed location for commuter buses would not have capacity for charter buses and tour buses.

The PANYNJ announced considerable toll increases on its crossings between New York and New Jersey in August 2011, citing as one of their reasons the construction of an $800 million &quot;new bus garage connected to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, which will serve as a traffic reliever to the Lincoln Tunnel and midtown Manhattan streets, saving two-thirds of the empty bus trips that must make two extra trips through the tunnel each day.&quot; Originally included in the PANYNJ 2007–2016 Capital Plan, construction of the garage was scrapped by the agency in October 2011, after it cited budgetary constraints due to an arrangement whereby the toll increases would be incrementally implemented.

In April 2012, the director of the PANYNJ reported that a proposal had been made by developer Larry Silverstein, who has a memorandum of understanding to develop a property at 39th Street and Dyer Avenue near the ramps between the tunnel and the terminal, to construct a bus garage with a residential tower above it. This parcel is not large enough to accommodate bus ramps and would require the use of elevators, which seemed to be a new type of application for bus storage. The proposal has not progressed any further.

In 2014, the PANYNJ made an application for a $230 million grant to the Federal Transit Administration for development of the garage.

===Replacement proposals===
In June 2013, the PANYNJ commissioned an 18-month study that was to consider reconfiguration, expansion, and replacement options for PABT and new bus staging and storage facilities on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. The $5.5 million contract awarded to Kohn Pedersen Fox and Parsons Brinckerhoff would look into potential public-private financing, including the sale of air rights and cost-sharing with private bus carriers.

In 2016, the PANYNJ invited a number of development teams to propose ideas for replacement of the existing bus terminal. Subsequently, in May 2019, the PANYNJ commenced the environmental review process for PABT&#x27;s replacement. The PANYNJ planned to host four public hearings, two each in New York and New Jersey, in July and September 2019. Three plans were considered: building a new terminal on the site, building a new terminal elsewhere, or moving intercity buses elsewhere while renovations took place in the existing terminal. In anticipation of opportunities that reconstruction of the bus terminal will portend, the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen South Coalition produced its own plan for the area.

In January 2021, the PANYNJ released plans for reconstructing the terminal on the same site, with expansion of bus layover facilities. The PANYNJ hired architects Boston-based Foster + Partners and Chicago-based design and engineering firm Epstein Global in August 2022 to design the new terminal, and $65 million was allocated to the project the next year. In January 2024, the Federal Transit Administration approved a draft environmental impact report for the replacement terminal. The PANYNJ announced revised plans for the terminal the same month, which called for of parks, a glass atrium, and a main entrance on 41st Street. The plans also called for two office buildings of at least 60 stories on 40th and 42nd streets. At the time, the new terminal was planned to cost $10 billion; new ramps to the terminal were to be completed by 2028, while the terminal itself was planned to be finished by 2032. The New York City Planning Commission approved the terminal-replacement plans in October 2024, and the plan received federal approval that December. In January 2025, the United States Department of Transportation disbursed a $1.89 billion grant for the Port Authority Bus Terminal&#x27;s reconstruction.

==Art and advertising==

&quot;The Commuters&quot;, a sculpture of three weary bus passengers and a clock salvaged from the original terminal by George Segal, was unveiled in the main ticket area in 1982. &quot;42nd Street Ballroom&quot;, a rolling ball sculpture by George Rhoads on the main floor of the North Wing, was installed in 1983. A statue of Jackie Gleason in the guise of one of his most famous characters, the bus driver Ralph Kramden, stands in front of the main entrance to the original South Wing. The plaque reads, &quot;Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden - Bus Driver - Raccoon Lodge Treasurer - Dreamer - Presented by the People of TV Land&quot;.

&quot;Triple Bridge Gateway&quot;, completed in 2009, is an art installation by Leni Schwendinger Light Projects, underneath the ramps connecting the tunnel and the terminal; it is part of the transformation of the Ninth Avenue entrance of the South Wing.

In July 2011, PABT became home to the world&#x27;s largest mediamesh, a stainless steel fabric embedded with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for various types of media, art, and advertising imagery. The LED imagery façade covers , and wraps around the corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue.

==Configuration==

=== Information and ticketing===
For many years there was no timetable board displaying departures at PABT; passengers were required to inquire at information booths or ticket counters for schedules and departure gates. In 2015, both the Port Authority and NJ Transit installed screens listing upcoming scheduled departures, though buses are not tracked so delays are not communicated via this method.

Tickets can be purchased on the main level (ground floor) of the South Wing at the main ticket plaza; Greyhound, Trailways and Short Line have additional ticket counters in the terminal.

New Jersey Transit (NJT) maintains a customer service counter at the terminal on the south wing main level (open weekdays). NJT has ticket vending machines (TVM) throughout the terminal. Effective in 2009, passengers boarding NJT buses are required to purchase a ticket before boarding. In April 2012, NJT began re-equipping machines that would give change for those paying cash with bills rather than $1 coins. NJT also accepts contactless payment systems (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) at TVMs, NJT&#x27;s mobile app, and ticket windows.

===Gates===

There are 223 departure gates of either saw-tooth (pull-in) or island platform (pull-through) design at PABT. At the Subway Level, or lower level of both wings, Gates 1-85 are predominantly used for long-distance travel, including buses to Canada, and jitneys, and during overnight hours (1 a.m. to 6 a.m.) for commuter lines. From 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., during the hours of normal operation, Gates 200–425, numbered to indicate the different boarding areas (100, 200, 300, etc.) within the complex are accessible from the 2nd floor and serve short-haul commuter lines. The third and fourth floors are respectively known as the 300 and 400 levels. Most NJ Transit routes and New Jersey private carrier commuter routes are on the 200, 300, and 400 levels.

===Retail and entertainment===
Like other transit hubs, PABT has undergone a series of renovations to create a mall-like sphere to promote its retail, food, entertainment, and services spaces. There are numerous franchise stores, such as Heartland Brewery, Au Bon Pain, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Hudson News, Duane Reade, GNC, plus a United States Postal Service branch station, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars throughout the terminal. Frames, a bowling alley (previously long known as Leisure Time Bowling) occupies a large space on the 2nd floor.

===Restrooms===
Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms in the bus terminal have been the subject of media attention; the women&#x27;s restroom on the second floor is the terminal&#x27;s busiest. It acts as a makeup counter, frequented by crowds daily due to its lighting, large mirrors, and cleanliness, a noted contrast to the rest of the unpopular terminal.

The men&#x27;s restrooms are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the Port Authority&#x27;s police department. The lawsuit exposed a trend of plainclothes officers targeting homosexual or effeminate men at the bus terminal&#x27;s restrooms. Five officers, of about 1,700 in the department, were responsible for 70 percent of public lewdness arrests in 2014, the year the lawsuit was filed. Most of the arrests have been for masturbation; the lawsuit alleged most of the arrests are targeted at LGBT men who have not performed any wrongful acts. The Port Authority Police Department ended the practice in 2022.

==Connecting transport==

Direct underground passageways connect the terminal with the of the New York City Subway at the and stations. Several bus routes operated by New York City Bus, including the local buses and the Staten Island express buses, stop immediately outside the terminal.

In the last decade, numerous jitney routes serving Hudson and Passaic counties in northern New Jersey pick up passengers inside the bus terminal or on the street outside the terminal. Dollar vans operated by Spanish Transportation to Paterson and Community Lines jitneys to Journal Square use platforms on the lower level. Routes to Bergenline Avenue/GWB Plaza, and Boulevard East depart from 42nd Street outside the bus terminal&#x27;s North Wing.

In 2011, a controversy arose when Megabus, a long-distance carrier using double-decker buses, with the permission of the New York City Department of Transportation, began to use the streets and sidewalk at the terminal. The director of the PANYNJ, citing safety, as well as other long-haul companies (which paid rent to use the terminal) citing unfair competitive advantage, were opposed to the permission to allow the company use of 41st Street directly beneath the connection between the two wings of the Port Authority. Despite these concerns and complaints, Megabus was initially permitted to stay. However, the permission was withdrawn later that year. Megabus now largely uses street-side stops near the Javits Center (for pickup) and Penn Station (for drop-off), except for a limited number of routes which use PABT.

==Capacity and overflow==

PABT is the gateway for most bus and jitney traffic entering Manhattan with more than 190,000 passengers on 6,000 bus trips made through the Lincoln Tunnel and terminal daily. The Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix (Route 495) in Hudson County, New Jersey passes through a cut and descends the Hudson Palisades to the Lincoln Tunnel; PABT is located at the other end. Starting in 1964, studies were conducted to address the feasibility of an exclusive bus lane (XBL) during the weekday morning peak period. The XBL, first implemented in 1970, serves weekday eastbound bus traffic between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. The lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits 16E and 17 and New Jersey Route 3. The helix, tunnel, and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the bi-state agency that also implements the contraflow express bus left lane in three westbound lanes. The XBL serves over 1,800 buses and 65,000 bus commuters on regular weekday mornings and is a major component of the morning &quot;inbound&quot; commutation crossing the Hudson River. Over 100 bus carriers utilize the Exclusive Bus Lane. As of 2013, New Jersey Transit operates fifty-seven interstate bus routes through the Lincoln Tunnel, as do numerous regional and long-distance companies.

Despite the XBL to the tunnel, there are often long delays due to congestion caused by the limited capacity of bus lanes for deboarding passengers at the bus terminal, which has reached its capacity. leading to re-routing and overflow on local streets In December 2011, the New Jersey Assembly passed a resolution calling upon the PANYNJ to address the issue of congestion. Congestion contributed to a decline of the on-time performance of buses, which was 92 percent in 2012 and 85 percent in the first quarter of 2014. Thomas Duane, representing New York&#x27;s 29th Senate District which includes the area around PABT, has also called for reduced congestion in the neighborhood. A consortium of regional transportation advocates, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, have proposed a reconfiguration and expansion of the terminal, a PM westbound XBL, bus stops at other Manhattan locations, and a new bus storage depot. A proposed bus garage in Midtown, so that daytime turnover buses could avoid unnecessarily traveling through the tunnel without passengers, was scrapped by the agency in October 2011. In May 2012, the commissioner of NJDOT suggested that some NJ Transit routes could originate/terminate at other Manhattan locations, notably the East Side; an arrangement requiring approval of the NYC Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to use bus stops.

<text>Joseph Schildkraut (22 March 1896 – 21 January 1964) was an Austrian-American actor. He won an Oscar for his performance as Captain Alfred Dreyfus in the film &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937). He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as Otto Frank in the film &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959) and a Primetime Emmy for his performance as Rabbi Gottlieb in a 1962 episode of the television series &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;.

== Early life ==
Schildkraut was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Erna (née Weinstein) and stage (and later motion picture) actor Rudolph Schildkraut. His family was Jewish. 

In 1910, he accompanied his father on his tour to the U.S. and returned to Europe in 1913. He began stage training with Max Reinhardt in Berlin shortly afterward, began his career on the stages of Germany and Austria, then made the transition to film. Schildkraut moved to the U.S. in 1920 and appeared in many Broadway productions. Among the plays in which he starred was a notable production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

==Career==
In 1921, Schildkraut played the title role in the first American stage production of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot;, the play that eventually became the basis for Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot;. He then began working in silent movies, but he returned to the stage occasionally. He had early success in film as the Chevalier de Vaudrey in D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; with Lillian Gish. Later, he was featured in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s epic 1927 film &quot;The King of Kings&quot; as Judas Iscariot. Schildraut&#x27;s father Rudolf also appeared in the film. Joseph Schildkraut also played a Viennese-accented, non-singing Gaylord Ravenal in the 1929 part-talkie film version of Edna Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;. The character as written in the 1929 film was much closer to Ferber&#x27;s original than to the depiction of him in the classic Kern and Hammerstein musical play based on the novel as well as the 1936 and 1951 film versions of the musical, but the 1929 film was not a critical or box-office success. 

Schildkraut received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Alfred Dreyfus in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937). Additional accolades came for playing the ambitious duc d&#x27;Orléans in the historical epic &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938), and he gave a notable performance as the villainous Nicolas Fouquet in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939).

Schildkraut is perhaps best remembered today for playing the role of Otto Frank in both the original stage production and film version of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959). Noticeably, he plays the villain in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940). He was also an active character actor and appeared in guest roles on several early television shows, including the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, in which he played Claudius in the 1953 television production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Maurice Evans in the title role. Schildkraut also hosted and starred in &quot;Joseph Schildkraut Presents&quot;, a short-lived series on the DuMont Television Network from October 1953 to January 1954.

In 1961, during the third season of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he made his first appearance on &quot;Deaths-Head Revisited&quot;. He later played an elderly man in &quot;The Trade-Ins&quot; in season 3, episode 31 of the same show. In 1963, he was nominated for a Best Actor Emmy Award for his performance in a guest-starring role on &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;.

==Personal life==
Schildkraut was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elise Bartlett in 1923; they divorced in 1931. He was married to Mary McKay from 1932 until her death on February 17, 1962. In 1963, Schildkraut married Leonora Rogers, who survived him.

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Schildkraut has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6780 Hollywood Boulevard. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Death==
Schildkraut died at his home in New York City of a heart attack. His father had died at the age of 68, also of a heart attack.

<doc id="768339" wikidata="Q7866985" url="?curid=768339" title="USS Absecon (AVP-23)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Absecon&quot; (AVP-23) was a United States Navy &quot;Barnegat&quot;-class seaplane tender in commission from 1943 to 1947, converted during construction to serve as a catapult training ship during World War II. The ship was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC &quot;Absecon&quot; (WAVP-374), later WHEC-374, from 1949 to 1972. Transferred to South Vietnam in 1972, she served in the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; (HQ-15) until she was captured by North Vietnam at the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975. After that, she served in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam″s Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy as PRVSN &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; (HQ-01).

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Absecon&quot; was laid down on 23 July 1941 at Houghton, Washington, by Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 8 March 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Robert L. Moon, Jr., the daughter of Captain G. E. Davis – who was then the chief of staff to the Commandant of the 13th Naval District – and the wife of Commander Robert L. Moon, Jr.. &quot;Absecon&quot; was unique among the &quot;Barnegat&quot;-class ships in that she was the only one fitted with an aircraft catapult and cranes for handling floatplanes. Her redesign from the standard seaplane tender configuration resulted from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s need for pilots to gain experience needed to qualify for catapult operations in battleship- and cruiser-based floatplane aviation units. &quot;Absecon&quot; was converted to this configuration during construction. She commissioned at the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bermerton, Washington, on 28 January 1943 and completed her fitting out period on 14 February 1943

==United States Navy service==

===World War II===
&quot;Absecon&quot; was assigned the duty of providing aviator training for catapulting and sled net recovery of floatplanes while underway. She commenced her shakedown cruise on 15 February 1943, her aircraft complement consisting of one SO3C Seamew and a pair of OS2U Kingfishers.

On her way from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean via the Panama Canal, &quot;Absecon&quot; picked up seven survivors from SS &quot;Olancho&quot;, a freighter which had been torpedoed by a German submarine.

From March to September 1943, &quot;Absecon&quot; operated out of the Naval Section Base at Mayport, Florida, coordinating observation-plane pilot training and serving as a target for practice torpedo runs. On 16 April 1943, she struck a submerged wreck that caused considerable damage to her hull. Following repairs, she resumed her duties.

In September 1943, &quot;Absecon&quot; was shifted to operate from Port Everglades, Florida. She carried out her training activities there into the winter of 1943–1944. One event highlighted her service during this period: On 13 November 1943, while serving as a target ship for torpedo bombers, &quot;Absecon&quot; observed a small freighter, SS &quot;Franklin Baker&quot;, flying distress signals. &quot;Absecon&quot; initially attempted to tow &quot;Franklin Baker&quot; to shore. When it became apparent that &quot;Franklin Baker&quot; would not move even under tow and was a navigational hazard, &quot;Absecon&quot; took her crew on board and attempted to sink her. Two depth charges and eighteen 5-inch (127-millimeter) projectiles failed to sink the freighter. The United States Coast Guard assisted in the effort to sink &quot;Franklin Baker&quot;, eventually succeeding by setting demolition charges on board her.

During 1944, &quot;Absecon&quot; conducted 1,394 catapult launchings and a corresponding number of recoveries and qualified 211 pilots, thus averaging approximately 116 launches per month with 18 pilots a month qualifying for the operation of cruiser and battleship-based floatplanes such as the SO3C Seamew, the OS2U Kingfisher, the SOC Seagull, and the SC Seahawk. Her peak month of operations was November 1944, when she conducted 279 launchings and qualified 58 aviators.

In addition to this duty, she continued to serve as a mobile target for torpedo planes. Shallow-running exercise torpedoes struck &quot;Absecon&quot; four times during 1944: on 30 January 1944, on 24 June 1944, on 19 August 1944, and on 31 October 1944. The first hit flooded two compartments, the third caused flooding in the forward engine room, and the last caused a small rupture in the shell plating.

Between 17 October 1944 and 20 October 1944, &quot;Absecon&quot; was caught in a hurricane while moored in Mayport. After sending her aircraft inland, she rode out the storm, experiencing winds of up to 100 knots (115 miles per hour or 190 kilometers per hour).

&quot;Absecon&quot; assisted the fishing boat &quot;Chip&quot; on 6 February 1945. She was again hit by an exercise torpedo on 19 February 1945 and was forced to enter dry dock at the Charleston Navy Yard in Charleston, South Carolina, to repair her starboard propeller.

On five occasions during 1945, aircraft capsized during recovery operations. All resulted in the salvage of the aircraft involved except the last, on 4 August 1945. On that occasion she sank the plane, apparently damaged beyond repair, with gunfire.

&quot;Absecon&quot; was based at Port Everglades until mid-July 1945, when she shifted to Pensacola, Florida, for duty involving training and logistical support of the observation aircraft operations there. &quot;Absecon&quot; carried out this training through the end of World War II on 15 August 1945 and into September 1945. During those nine months, she conducted 1,839 catapult launches, an average of 204 per month, and qualified 274 pilots. Her peak production of pilots occurred in March 1945 when she qualified 45, and her peak number of launches occurred during August 1945, when she conducted 340.

===Post-World War II===
As the helicopter began to supplant cruiser- and battleship-based seaplanes, the need for qualifying pilots of floatplanes diminished accordingly. After a period as a training ship based at Pensacola, &quot;Absecon&quot; was decommissioned on 19 March 1947 and placed in reserve, laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in Orange, Texas.

==United States Coast Guard service==

&quot;Barnegat&quot;-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the United States Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the &quot;Casco&quot;-class cutters.

The U.S. Navy loaned &quot;Absecon&quot; to the Coast Guard on 4 January 1949. After she underwent conversion for service as a weather reporting ship, the Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC &quot;Absecon&quot; (WAVP-374) in May 1949.

===Service history===
&quot;Absecon&quot; was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia, throughout her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations.

During the 1950s, &quot;Absecon&quot; frequently visited Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, and Bermuda between stints on patrol on the high seas in the North and central Atlantic Ocean and periods of regular upkeep at Norfolk. On 5 March 1955, &quot;Absecon&quot; provided medical assistance to a cadet aboard the Swedish training schooner HMS &quot;Falken&quot; en route to Bermuda.

On 21 September 1957, &quot;Absecon&quot;, on her ocean station in the central Atlantic, picked up a distress call from the West German four-masted steel-hulled bark &quot;Pamir&quot;. The square rigger, homeward bound from Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a cargo of barley and with 86 men (52 teen-aged cadets among them) on board, had run into Hurricane Carrie and been battered severely by the vicious storm, ultimately sinking. &quot;Absecon&quot; altered course immediately and stood toward &quot;Pamir&quot;″s last position. Arriving on the scene on 22 September 1957, &quot;Absecon&quot; immediately began sweeping the stormy sea for signs of life, aided by Portuguese Air Force and United States Air Force planes from the Azores and U.S. Navy planes from Bermuda. Sixty ships, representing 13 nations, searched for survivors for one week, with &quot;Absecon&quot; coordinating their efforts. Ultimately, six survivors – four crewman and two cadets – were recovered; the American merchant ship &quot;Saxon&quot; rescued five men on 24 September 1957, three days after &quot;Pamir&quot; had sunk, while &quot;Absecon&quot; found &quot;Pamir&quot;″s last survivor, 22-year-old Günter Haselbach, on 25 September 1957. The other 80 men and boys had perished.

In 1958, &quot;Absecon&quot; made a cruise to Europe, visiting Hamburg, West Germany; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Dublin, Ireland; and Lisbon, Portugal, before returning, via Bermuda, to the United States East Coast.

In 1960 and again in 1962, &quot;Absecon&quot; participated in a Coast Guard cadet practice cruise to Canada, Europe, and Bermuda. She was damaged by heavy seas on 7 March 1962 while putting to sea from Norfolk to assist merchant ships during a storm.

From 20 through 23 July 1963, &quot;Absecon&quot; stood by the disabled merchant ship &quot;Seven Seas&quot; in the mid-Atlantic and escorted the ship to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada.

On 13 September 1963, &quot;Absecon&quot; rescued the third engineer of the West German merchant ship &quot;Freiberg&quot; midway between Bermuda and the Azores after he had fallen overboard and remained in the water for 17 hours.

In February 1966, &quot;Absecon&quot; stood by the disabled British merchant ship &quot;Parthia&quot; while waiting for a commercial tug.

&quot;Absecon&quot; was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-374 on 1 May 1966.

On 13 November 1969, &quot;Absecon&quot; evacuated a crewman of the merchant ship &quot;Morgenstern&quot; in need of medical assistance while &quot;Morgenstern&quot; was in the mid-Atlantic.

In late 1971, while battling seas over 30 feet (9.1 meters) in height on Ocean Station Charlie in the North Atlantic, &quot;Absecon&quot; narrowly escaped capsizing when she was hammered by a rogue wave estimated at 50 feet (15 meters) in height that rolled her 32.5 degrees, only one-half-degree short of her rollover point.

Early in 1972, &quot;Absecon&quot; was called to conduct a search and rescue action while on Ocean Station Bravo when a U.S. Navy pilot went down while on a training mission off the Virginia coast. She recovered only a life jacket from the ocean, and the pilot and the wreckage of his plane were never found.

===Decommissioning and transfer to South Vietnam===
In April 1972, &quot;Absecon&quot; and two of her sister ships, the Coast Guard cutters and , were deployed as Coast Guard Squadron Two, with crews composed mainly of members of the United States Coast Guard Reserve. They were originally scheduled to sail to Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, but were diverted to the U.S. Navy base at Apra Harbor, Guam. The Coast Guard decommissioned the three cutters and transferred them to the U.S. Navy, these events both occurring for &quot;Absecon&quot; on 9 May 1972. After her antisubmarine warfare equipment had been removed, she was transferred to South Vietnam on 15 June 1972.

==Republic of Vietnam Navy service==
South Vietnam commissioned the former &quot;Absecon&quot; into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; (HQ-15) She was the last of seven former &quot;Casco&quot;-class cutters transferred to South Vietnam in 1971 and 1972. Known in South Vietnam as the &quot;Tran Quang Khai&quot;-class frigates, they were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam&#x27;s largest naval guns. &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore.

South Vietnam collapsed in late April 1975, bringing the Vietnam War to an end. Although all six of her sister ships fled to the Philippines, &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; remained behind and was captured by North Vietnam in May 1975.

==Vietnam People″s Navy service==

&quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; was commissioned into the Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy of the now-unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam as the patrol vessel PRVSN &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; (HQ-01).

===Modifications===

When captured, &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; was armed with the American weaponry that South Vietnam had relied upon. The Vietnam People″s Navy appears to have retained its major components, such as the 5-inch 38-caliber (127-millimeter) gun and 81-mm mortars. In the mid-1980s, Soviet-made 37-mm and 25-mm guns were installed for close-in defense, as were two Soviet-made SS-N-2 (NATO reporting name &quot;Styx&quot;) anti-ship cruise missile launchers and two Soviet-made quad SA-N-5 (NATO reporting name &quot;Grail&quot;) surface-to-air-missile launchers. However, all the missile launchers are thought to have been removed in the 1990s.

===Service history===
On 10 January 1979, &quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot; joined the Vietnam People′s Navy patrol boats , , , and in an action off Ream, Cambodia, that resulted in the sinking of two Cambodian warships.

&quot;Pham Ngu Lao&quot;&#x27;s status in the secretive Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy is murky, but she was thought to be in active service into the 1990s and perhaps as recently as 2000. By the early-to-mid-2000s she apparently was inactive and may have been decommissioned.

<text>Thomas John Mitchell (; July 11, 1892 – December 17, 1962) was an Irish-American actor and writer. Among his most famous roles in a long career are those of Gerald O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Doc Boone in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, Uncle Billy in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, Pat Garrett in &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, and Mayor Jonas Henderson in &quot;High Noon&quot;. Mitchell was the first male actor to gain the Triple Crown of Acting by winning an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony Award.

Mitchell was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the films, &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937), and &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), winning for the latter. He was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 1952 and 1953, for his role in the medical drama &quot;The Doctor&quot;, and won in 1953. While he was nominated again in 1955, for an appearance on a weekly anthology series, he did not win. Mitchell won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, in 1953, for his role as Dr Downer in the musical comedy &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;, based on the 1937 screwball comedy film &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, rounding out the Triple Crown of Acting. In addition to being an actor, he was also a director, playwright, and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born to Irish immigrants in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He came from a family of journalists and civic leaders. Both his father and brother were newspaper reporters, and his nephew, James P. Mitchell, later served as Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of Labor. In the 1952 presidential election, Mitchell, a Republican, supported Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign. The younger Mitchell also became a newspaper reporter after graduating from St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth. However, Mitchell soon found that he enjoyed writing theatrical skits much more than chasing scoops. In 1927 Mitchell joined The Lambs.

==Acting career==
He became an actor in 1913, at one point touring with Charles Coburn&#x27;s Shakespeare Company. Even while playing leading roles on Broadway into the 1920s, Mitchell continued to write. One of the plays he co-authored, &quot;Little Accident&quot;, was eventually made into a film (three times) by Hollywood. Mitchell&#x27;s first credited screen role was in the 1923 film &quot;Six Cylinder Love&quot;. Mitchell&#x27;s breakthrough role was as the embezzler in Frank Capra&#x27;s film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937).

Following this performance, he was much in demand in Hollywood. That same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, directed by John Ford.

Over the next few years, Mitchell appeared in many significant films. Forty-three of the fifty-nine films in which he acted were made in the 10-year period from 1936 to 1946. Considered one of the finest character actors in film, in 1939 alone he had key roles in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. While probably better remembered as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s loving but doomed father in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, it was for his performance as the drunken Doc Boone in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, co-starring John Wayne (in Wayne&#x27;s breakthrough role), that Mitchell won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. In his acceptance speech, he quipped, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know I was that good&quot;. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Mitchell acted in a wide variety of roles in productions such as 1940&#x27;s &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, 1942&#x27;s &quot;Moontide&quot;, 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (as an atheist doctor) and &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) as the town mayor. He is probably best known to audiences today for his role as Uncle Billy in Capra&#x27;s Christmas classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) with James Stewart.

From the 1950s and into the early 1960s, Mitchell worked primarily in television, appearing in a variety of roles in some of the most well-regarded early series of the era, including &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theater&quot; (in a pilot episode that became the CBS series &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;), and &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; productions. In 1954, he starred in the television version of the radio program, &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;. In 1955, he played Kris Kringle in &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot; version of &quot;The Miracle on 34th Street&quot; opposite Teresa Wright and MacDonald Carey. In 1957 he hosted The O. Henry Playhouse. In 1959, he starred in thirty-nine episodes of the syndicated television series, Glencannon, which had aired two years earlier in the United Kingdom.

Mitchell&#x27;s last role was on the stage, portraying Columbo, a detective character previously played by Bert Freed on an episode of &quot;The Chevy Mystery Show&quot; and later made famous on NBC and ABC television by Peter Falk.

==Death==
Mitchell died at age 70 from peritoneal mesothelioma in Beverly Hills, California. He was cremated at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory and, at his request, his ashes were placed in private vaultage. As a part of a 2023 cataloging project of the cremains in the vaults, Mitchell&#x27;s family confirmed his wishes that his ashes remain in vaultage and not be made publicly accessible.

<text>McNichols Sports Arena was an indoor arena located in Denver, Colorado, United States. Located adjacent to Mile High Stadium and completed in 1975, at a cost of $16 million, it seated 16,061 for hockey games and 17,171 for basketball games.

==Sports use==
It was named after Denver mayor William H. McNichols Jr., who served from 1968 to 1983. A small-scale scandal surrounded the naming because McNichols was in office at the time.

Twenty-seven luxury suites were installed as part of a 1986 renovation. The renovation also saw the original Stewart-Warner end-zone scoreboards, which each had color matrix screens, upgraded by White Way Sign with new digits and to include new color video screens.

McNichols Sports Arena was the home of the Denver Nuggets of the ABA and NBA for its entire existence from 1975 to 1999. It also hosted multiple hockey teams, including the Denver Spurs of the WHA during the 1975–76 season, the Colorado Rockies of the NHL from 1976 to 1982, the Colorado Flames of the CHL from 1982 to 1984, the Denver Grizzlies of the International Hockey League from 1994 to 1995, and the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL from 1995 to 1999.

The NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets played their last game on May 5, 1999, against the Houston Rockets, and the Colorado Avalanche played their final game on June 1, 1999, during the playoffs versus the Dallas Stars. Though the arena was only 24 years old when it was demolished, like most arenas of the 1970s, it was narrow and dark in the concourse-level corridors. In addition, the locker rooms and shower facilities were not updated to NBA and NHL standards. Also, the arena lacked enough luxury suites (27 compared to some newer arenas&#x27; 200 or more) and had no club seating. Combined, these factors effectively made McNichols Sports Arena obsolete.

The arena closed after the Nuggets and Avalanche moved to the Pepsi Center (now Ball Arena) and was demolished in 2000 to make space for a parking lot surrounding Empower Field at Mile High.

===Notable events===
McNichols hosted the NCAA Final Four in 1990, won by UNLV over Duke University and the West Regional semifinal in 1996. It was also host to the 1976 ABA All-Star Game, in which the host Nuggets defeated the ABA All-Stars, games 1, 2, and 5 of the 1976 ABA finals, and the 1984 NBA All-Star Game. It also hosted games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals in 1996, where the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Florida Panthers in four games to bring Denver its first major sports championship.

UFC 1, the first event of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, was held there in 1993.

Another notable event at McNichols took place on December 13, 1983, when the Nuggets hosted the Detroit Pistons in a regular season contest. Nuggets players Kiki Vandeweghe and Alex English scored 51 and 47 points, respectively, while Piston Isiah Thomas also scored 47 points, with teammate John Long scoring 41 in a 186–184 triple-overtime Detroit win over the Nuggets. The game, still to date, is the highest-scoring game in NBA history, and also holds the record for the most players to score 40 or more points in a single game. However, the game was not televised in the Denver area (instead being shown back to the Detroit market, via WKBD-TV) and was attended by just over 9,300 people. This game has since been broadcast on NBA TV and ESPN Classic.

<doc id="768361" wikidata="Q5449911" url="?curid=768361" title="Finder (comics)">
<text>Finder is a science fiction comic book series written and drawn by Carla Speed McNeil, and is currently published by Dark Horse Comics. McNeil describes &quot;Finder&quot; as &quot;aboriginal science fiction&quot; and their storylines throw together characters from recognizable aboriginal and modern urban societies in a far-future Earth. Finder is the recipient of numerous awards and award nominations.

Finder was also listed in the British Science Fiction Association&#x27;s journal &quot;Vector&quot; among six groundbreaking science fiction comics. &quot;The world-building is immense...&quot; and compared it to Dave Sim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus&quot; in terms of &quot;...sheer scale of storytelling&quot;.

==Setting==
The series is set in a vastly depopulated far-future Earth where numerous hunter-gatherer cultures, some human and some not, surround densely overpopulated domed city-states of recognizably modern urbanites functioning at a high technological level. Our own civilization and its considerably more advanced successors are lost to prehistory save for a few twentieth-century pop cultural artifacts conveniently recovered by well-paid psychics.

The cities, particularly the city state of &quot;Anvard,&quot; are dominated by wealthy and exclusive clans which self-select their members for physical and psychological homogeneity and head up a hierarchy of half-clan culls, clanless half-citizens, slaves, visiting nomads (some non-human), and genetic &quot;constructs&quot; with animal features. Large corporations and a decentralized infotrader/media network both wield considerable and at times quite nefarious influence. Office workers routinely jack in to virtual reality environments while walking the city as zombies.

The societies outside the domes endure less overt injustice but much more privation and danger. These include, but are not limited to, several aboriginal human cultures, an all-but-matriarchal civilization of lion-women, enigmatic raptor lizards with organs adapted specifically to brain surgery and genetic engineering, and cow-horned farmer-pirates harvesting enemy crops in giant militarized combines, and they are all constantly in low-grade conflict with each other for scarce resources.

==Characters==
All storylines thus far feature one of two aboriginal characters although several focus chiefly on their urban contacts.

===Jaeger===
The main character is &quot;Jaeger&quot; Ayers, who is half-redneck and half &quot;Ascian&quot; (McNeil&#x27;s stand-in culture for real-world Native Americans). Jaeger has featured in all storylines thus far, whether as protagonist or in cameos and flashbacks, although McNeil has stated the intention to continue the series without him at some future date, when his story is completed.

Jaeger is the son of an Ascian mother of whom he knows nothing, and a rural white father whose death in Jaeger&#x27;s early teens set him travelling with a nomadic Ascian camp which ordained Jaeger as both a &quot;Sin-eater,&quot; or ritual scapegoat, and a &quot;Finder,&quot; a member of a secret society of extremely skilled hunter-trackers bound to give aid when asked. He divides his time inside and outside of cities, where he sleeps with strings of fascinated women to have a place to sleep and makes a living as fighter/killer for hire.

His personality is best characterized by his astonishing self-sufficiency, and his ability to travel nearly anywhere, relate to nearly anyone, and survive nearly anything. He&#x27;s assisted in this by a nearly miraculous physical healing ability for which he himself has no explanation. Both of these gifts are balanced by self-destructive tendencies, a need to sustain (or self-inflict) serious physical injuries to remain healthy, and a corresponding (and seemingly connected) inability to remain in any one place or relationship for long. There are hints that he is aging slowly or not at all.

===Vary===

Vary L. S. (Lakya Sagarananda) Krishna, who is the main character of only one story collection thus far, has come to the big city from a Hautami (Indian (Asian)) community. She&#x27;s joint-majoring in anthropology and prostitution, the latter recognized as a prestigious art form, and serving as assistant to both of her anthropology professors, a cantankerous human and a giant plumed lizard, with both of whom she is quite frustratedly in love.

===Grosvenor-Lockhart family===

Jaeger&#x27;s chief acquaintances in the city of Anvard are Emma Lockhart, Brigham Grosvenor, and their three daughters, one of whom is biologically male. Brigham, Jaeger&#x27;s sergeant from army days, comes from a stoic clan of cops and soldiers, but glamorous Emma&#x27;s clan self-selects for theatricality and feminine gender characteristics in both sexes. Their union, which is held as anathema to both of their clans, has contributed to Brigham&#x27;s derangement, the handling of which is Jaeger&#x27;s primary task in &quot;Sin-Eater.&quot;

Of the three children, the eldest child Rachel&#x27;s attempt to gain admittance to her mother&#x27;s clan (and to perhaps do something by herself for once in her life) appeared on McNeil&#x27;s website for collection in 2008 as Finder volume 9; youngest child Marcie&#x27;s quest to find a certain lost book if only by writing it is the subject of volume #4; while the story of middle-child Lynne has yet to be written but may complete a hypothetical &quot;three sisters&quot; hardcover McNeil has speculated about releasing.

===Others===

*a celebrity virtual reality artist named Magri White; 
*Chief Coward&#x27;s Ascian tribe, including young rebel Jackdaw and a band of his followers helping him explore the city
*Grazie Maugheri, who broadcasts an unlicensed TV program on healthcare as a sexual fetish - a subject she researches quite intimately, at times with Jaeger as subject;
*Brom, Jaeger&#x27;s closest and oldest male friend seen thus far, who Jaeger won&#x27;t sleep with and who once beat Jaeger near to death with a chair leg; 
*Vary Krishna&#x27;s professors and fellow students in Xenology/Anthropology and The Art.
* Royal &quot;Roy&quot; Sudamer Ayers, Jaeger&#x27;s half-brother and possible love interest of Rachel.

==Themes==
&quot;Finder&quot; tends to focus on the primarily Western/liberal social norms of and media consumption habits of its urban characters, seen from the viewpoint of their aboriginal neighbors, and on all her characters&#x27; strategies, chiefly through travel or artistic endeavor, to escape the often quite intractable limits their societies (and others) place on them.

The series makes allusions to various genres of science fiction and fantasy; apparent influences include Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delany, and cyberpunk for thematic content, and a wide range of work for the visual aspects, from old horror comics and simple line cartoons to the science fiction work of Mœbius.

==Awards==

McNeil and Finder have been nominated for seven Eisner Awards and won in 2009 for Best Digital Comic. Finder has also won one Kimberly Yale Award and three Ignatz awards. &quot;Finder: Voice&quot; won the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Graphic Novel). In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Jaeger Ayers as #8 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;.

==Publication==
McNeil first self-published the series through their &quot;Lightspeed Press&quot;. They began the series in the customary comics format of 24-page magazine/pamphlets, which they soon began collecting on a roughly annual basis in trade paperback editions containing extensive footnotes explaining particulars of the story and of the richly detailed world the characters are moving through.

In 2005, prompted both by low profits on the single-issues and by the format&#x27;s implicit limitations on story pacing, McNeil ended the pamphlet format of the series with issue #38, and moved regular publication of the story onto their website, with two fresh pages a week appearing free on her website, formerly called www.lightspeedpress.com. The solidly profitable trade-paperback collections continued to appear annually in time for the summer convention season, although in 2007, &quot;Finder Book 1&quot;, a hardcover collection of the first two volumes, was issued as that year&#x27;s book, and Volume 9&#x27;s release pushed ahead to summer 2008.

With a few additions, the volumes have presented the single issues (and then the webcomic) in their original order of production, except for issue #22 (included with vols 1 &amp; 2 in the hardcover &quot;Book 1&quot;), issue #30 (batched with issue #38 (and its online continuation) in Volume 8); and the two issues of McNeil&#x27;s connecting side project &quot;Mystery Date&quot; which, with issue #31, form the bulk of &quot;Finder Volume 6&quot;. The collections have included short stories such as &quot;Counting Coup&quot; or &quot;The Model&#x27;s Artist&quot; and &quot;Brief Wake&quot; while rare shorts such as &quot;Free Trade&quot; have appeared on the website.

In 2010, McNeil made a publishing deal with Dark Horse Comics. Finder Library Volume One, which is a reprint of the first three stories, was released under Dark Horse in 2011, along with Finder Library Volume Two later that year. Dark Horse also individually published the arcs Voice, Third World, and Talisman; Talisman also has a limited-edition hardcover version that is signed by McNeil. These arcs, along with the two omnibus collections, are also available in digital versions.

<doc id="768362" wikidata="Q2885621" url="?curid=768362" title="Barrie Unsworth">
<text>Barrie John Unsworth (born 16 April 1934) is an Australian former politician, representing the Labor Party in the Parliament of New South Wales from 1978 to 1991. He served as the 36th Premier from July 1986 to March 1988. Since the death of Steele Hall on 10 June 2024, Unsworth is the oldest living premier of an Australian state.

==Early years==
Unsworth, the son of Joseph and Olive Unsworth, was born in Dubbo, New South Wales, and educated in Sydney, at Kogarah High School. On leaving school at age 15, he was apprenticed as an electrical fitter. In 1955, aged 21 years, he married Pauline Hennessy and they subsequently had one daughter and three sons, one of whom has died; he and his wife have nine grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. Unsworth was initially an Apprentice Electrical Fitter, then Electrical Fitter, Electrical Testing Officer and subsequently Sales Representative for Sydney County Council from 1950 until 1960.

Unsworth had a brief period of military national service in 1953–1954 in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Union career==
In 1961, Unsworth became an organiser of the Electrical Trades Union, and continued to build his career in the labour movement. He was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1966 to attend Harvard University Trade Union Program. The following year he was elected to the Labor Council of NSW and was its elected Secretary from 1979 to 1984. Unsworth was an Australian delegate to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh Study Conference, Oxford University in 1974.

During his career as an elected union official, he was appointed by the Wran Labor NSW Government to a range of positions on government bodies including:
* Public Transport Commission of New South Wales, Commissioner (1972–1975)
* Pipeline Authority, Member (1973–1978)

While working in the union movement Unsworth worked for the United States of America in what a historian has called &quot;a discreet relationship&quot;.

==Political career==

Unsworth was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1978. While serving in the Legislative Council, he represented Australia as a delegate at the International Labour Organization (ILO) Worker Participation in Management Conferences held in Geneva (1980) and The Hague (1981).

In the Wran Labor Government, Unsworth was Minister for Transport (1984–1986) and Minister for Health (February–July 1986).

After the surprise retirement of Premier Neville Wran in May 1986, Unsworth became leader of the NSW Labor Party and thus Premier, and was also Minister for Ethnic Affairs and Minister for State Development. As Premiers are required by convention to be members of the Legislative Assembly, Brian Bannon, the member for the normally safe Labor seat of Rockdale, resigned to accept a government job as Chairman of the Homebush States Sport Centre Trust, and Unsworth contested the resulting by-election held on 2 August 1986. He only narrowly won the seat, with a 17.1% dive in the primary vote and hostile independent preferences giving him a margin of just 54 votes.

Unlike several of his predecessors including Wran, Unsworth chose not to be his own Treasurer.

Unsworth was Premier for two years until the Labor Party&#x27;s landslide defeat by the Liberals&#x27; Nick Greiner in the 1988 elections. Unsworth did not contest the 1991 election.

==Life after politics==
Immediately following politics, Unsworth had little political involvement with his only public commitment being as deputy chairman and then Chairman of the Australian Executive Committee for His Royal Highness Duke of Edinburgh Study Conference (1982–1998). Unsworth was General Manager of 2KY Broadcasters Pty Ltd Racing Radio 1992–2000. In 2001, he was a recipient of the Centenary Medal.

Following the election of the Carr Labor Government in 1995, Unsworth was placed on a number of key government and community bodies, including:
* Australia Day Council of New South Wales, Chairman (1995–2003)
* Totalizator Agency Board, Director (1997–2004)
* Delta Electricity, Director (1997–2006)
* New South Wales Centenary of Federation Committee, Chairman (1997–2002)
* Tempo Services, Director (1999–2005)
* Ambulance Service of New South Wales, Chairman (2001–2008)
* RailCorp, Director (2005–2008)
* State Transit Authority, Chairman (November 2004 to November 2009)
* WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, Chairman (1995–1997)
* Constitution Education Fund Australia, Trustee

During 2003 - 2008, Unsworth was a Director of Father Chris Riley&#x27;s charity, Youth off the Streets, that provides crisis care, refuges, schools, drug programs and alcohol programs to young people in Australia and throughout Asia. Unsworth has also been a Director of Entherm Pty Ltd (2003–2005), Member of Overseas Trade Authority of New South Wales (1978) and a Director of Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (2004–2006).

In 2003 and 2004, Unsworth was commissioned by the NSW Government to conduct a formal review of public bus services. In 2008 he headed a committee that considered the privatisation of the New South Wales&#x27; electricity industry. The committee and Unsworth supported the sale.

Unsworth lives in the Northern Beaches where he has participated in community campaigns to stop overdevelopment in NSW. He also led the effort to purchase and preserve the former home of Gough Whitlam as a historic site which would be open to the public.

<doc id="768370" wikidata="Q3359522" url="?curid=768370" title="P50 (pressure)">
<text>In biochemistry, &quot;p&quot;50 represents the partial pressure of a gas required to achieve 50% saturation of a particular protein&#x27;s binding sites. Values of &quot;p&quot;50 are negatively correlated with substrate affinity; lower values correspond to higher affinity and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The term is analogous to the Michaelis–Menten constant (&quot;KM&quot;), which identifies the concentration of substrate required for an enzyme to achieve 50% of its maximum reaction velocity.

The concept of &quot;p&quot;50 is derived from considering the fractional saturation of a protein by a gas. Imagine myoglobin, a protein which is able to bind a single molecule of oxygen, as per the reversible reaction below, whose equilibrium constant &quot;K&quot; (which is also a dissociation constant, since it describes a reversible association-dissociation event) is equal to the product of the concentrations (at equilibrium) of free myoglobin and free oxygen, divided by the concentration of myoglobin-oxygen complex.

: &lt;chem&gt;Mb + O_2 &lt;=&gt; Mb \cdot O_2&lt;/chem&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;\it{K}=\rm\frac{[Mb][O_2]}{[Mb\cdot O_2]}&lt;/chem&gt;

The fractional saturation &quot;Y&quot;&quot;O&quot;2 of the myoglobin is what proportion of the total myoglobin concentration is made up of oxygen-bound myoglobin, which can be rearranged as the concentration of free oxygen over the sum of that concentration and the dissociation constant &quot;K&quot;. Since diatomic oxygen is a gas, its concentration in solution can be thought of as a partial pressure.

: formula_1

From defining the &quot;p&quot;50 as the partial pressure at which the fractional saturation is 50%, we can deduce that it is in fact equal to the dissociation constant &quot;K&quot;.

: formula_2

For example, myoglobin&#x27;s &quot;p&quot;50 for O2 is 130 pascals while the &quot;P&quot;50 for adult hemoglobin is 3.5 kPa. Thus, when O2 partial pressure is low, hemoglobin-bound O2 is more readily transferred to myoglobin. Myoglobin, found in high concentrations in muscle tissue, can then transfer the oxygen to muscle tissue muscle fibers, where it will be used in the generation of energy to fuel muscle contraction. Another example is that of human fetal hemoglobin, which has a higher affinity (lower &quot;P&quot;50) than adult hemoglobin, and therefore allows uptake of oxygen across the placental diffusion barrier.

<text>Bernhard Knipperdolling (c. 1495 – January 22, 1536) was a German leader of the Münster Anabaptists. He was also known as Bernd or Berndt Knipperdollinck or Knypperdollynck or Bertrand Knipperdoling; his birth name was van Stockem.

==Early life==
Born at the beginning of the sixteenth century in Münster, Knipperdolling was the son of a wealthy, patrician cloth merchant. Little is known of his life as a young man. He first came into the public eye when he became a guild leader in the city council. A follower of the preacher Bernhard Rothmann, in 1528 he showed his colours as a &quot;bold and proud&quot; Protestant by suing the Catholic Münster town council and the Bishop Franz von Waldeck at the Imperial Court of Justice. His position as guild leader meant he had the financial and political support of the guilds.

In January 1534, wandering Dutch Anabaptist preachers arrived in Münster proclaiming that a new prophet was on his way. They were soon followed by the &quot;prophet&quot; himself, the baker Jan Matthys of Haarlem. Knipperdolling became a passionate believer.

==Beliefs==
* Initial (pre-conflict) pacifism 
* Anti-clerical, anti-imperial socially mobile merchant
* Political pragmatist and strategist
Bernhard Knipperdolling taught that the righteous before the day of Judgment, [each person would] have a monarchy on earth and the wicked be destroyed, that men are not justified by their faith in Christ; that there is no original sin; that infants ought not to be baptized, and that immersion is the only mode of baptism; that every one has the authority to preach and administer the sacraments; that men are not obliged to pay respect to magistrates; that all things ought to be in common, and that it is lawful to marry many wives.

==Anabaptist revolution==

On February 10, 1534, Knipperdolling joined the movement to overthrow the town council and bishop, along with Jan Matthys and Jan Bockelson (or John of Leiden), one of Matthys&#x27; twelve disciples. He rallied the Anabaptists against conservative forces with &quot;frenzied ecstasies&quot;. Accepted by the council, Knipperdolling won the elections of February 24, 1534, becoming Lord Mayor of Münster – this was the high point of the Anabaptist movement. His house became the centre of the Anabaptist movement; on January 15, 1534 the first believers&#x27; baptisms were performed there.

When Matthys made his demand for the execution of all &quot;godless&quot; citizens of Münster, Knipperdolling convinced him to allow people a week&#x27;s time to be baptised, or leave the city. This avoided arousing international opposition against Münster and risking internal stability.
Knipperdolling organised military defenses against the Bishop&#x27;s troops. He was also made chief executioner to the Twelve Judges; as chief executive he balanced out Bockelson, the Judges&#x27; spokesman. He was in charge of executions, &quot;immigration officer&quot;, and the administrator of state property. Some of Matthys&#x27; policies went against Knipperdolling&#x27;s best interests, such as the dissolution of the guilds and the confiscation of private property.

After Matthys&#x27; death on April 4, 1534, Knipperdolling supported the leadership of Jan Bockelson, who was crowned king, supported by poor non-Münsterite Anabaptists. Soon, however, he was claiming superiority to Bockelson and prophesying that &quot;while Jan was king according to the flesh&quot;, he, Knipperdolling, was &quot;called to be the spiritual king&quot;. This led to his brief imprisonment in 1535. On his release, Knipperdolling was named Stadholder (vice-king and governor) and executioner. His daughter Clara was married to Jan Bockelson after the introduction of polygamy.

In 1535, Knipperdolling&#x27;s position of power was however once again lost when Heinrich Krechting became the king&#x27;s right-hand man.

On June 24–25, 1535, the Bishop, with the aid of the deserter Henry Gresbeck, retook Münster. Knipperdolling, Bockelson and Bernhard Krechting were imprisoned and interrogated. On January 22, 1536, Knipperdolling, Krechting, and Bockelson were publicly tortured and executed in Münster. Their corpses were suspended in metal baskets from the Lambertuskirche (St. Lambert&#x27;s Church), which had been the initial focus of the Anabaptist revolution.

==Significance==
As the worldly leader of the Münster Anabaptists, Knipperdolling was &quot;Steigbügelhalter&quot; (facilitator, literally &quot;stirrup-holder&quot;) and chief executive of the movement. Knipperdolling represented the local Münsterite basis of the revolution and his path shows their mode of adaptation to the siege situation and the rule of the Dutch Jans.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary the word &quot;knipperdolling&quot; once was used as a derogatory synonym for an Anabaptist and now generally refers to any person who is a religious fanatic.

<text>Market Square Arena (MSA) was an indoor arena in Indianapolis. Completed in 1974, at a cost of $23 million, it seated 16,530 for basketball and 15,993 for ice hockey. Seating capacity for concerts and other events was adjusted by the use of large curtains which sealed off the upper rows. The arena closed down in 1999 and was demolished two years later.

==History==

In the late 1960s, the city of Indianapolis studied several market areas of the city for future development and revitalization. Students from the fourth-year design studio class at Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning met with the City of Indianapolis to review and select 20–26 projects for consideration. Students Joseph Mynhier and Terry Pastorino selected downtown Indianapolis as their market and designed what would become Market Square Arena. The design envisioned by Mynhier and Pastorino was later selected and used as a promotional tool by the City of Indianapolis for construction of the stadium. The city selected four architectural firms to complete the arena design with two representatives from each of the four companies. Terry Pastorino, who had worked for the firm of Kennedy, Brown &amp; Trueblood during the summer of 1970 on the project, later joined the firm working on the arena.

The original student design included a four-story office building covering two city blocks. As constructed, the arena consisted of a unique space frame design spanning Market Street. The playing floor was elevated over Market Street by twin 1400-space parking garages on each side of Market Street. Market Street, which already was physically terminated on the west by the Indiana Statehouse, was visually terminated on the east by the arena. The final design eventually took up one city block spanning Market Street.

The arena was built using a $16 million contribution from the city of Indianapolis.

===Scoreboard===
Market Square Arena&#x27;s original center-hung scoreboard was an American Sign &amp; Indicator scoreboard with monochrome matrix screens, similar to those which would be installed at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum and Joe Louis Arena. Its replacement, another American Sign &amp; Indicator model, but with a color matrix screen on each of its four sides, was installed in time for the 1985 NBA All-Star Game held in the city and remained at the arena for the rest of its life, where it would later be complemented by front-projection video screens on each end of the arena.

===Demolition===
The Pacers moved to the new Conseco Fieldhouse, now Gainbridge Fieldhouse, for the 1999–2000 NBA season, and Market Square Arena was demolished on July 8, 2001, in a multimillion-dollar implosion performed by Controlled Demolition, Inc. It only took 12 seconds to demolish the arena completely. The arena&#x27;s basketball floor remains preserved and housed nearby within the National Institute for Fitness and Sport in White River State Park.

The site of the former arena was a parking lot for over a decade. The parking lot held a memorial to Elvis Presley, who played his final concert at MSA on June 26, 1977. The memorial was designed and built by Alan Clough.

In January 2017, Cummins opened its Global Distribution Headquarters on the southern half of the site. A 28-story apartment building named 360 Market Square and containing a Whole Foods Market store opened in March 2018 on the northern half. The Elvis memorial was then placed on the sidewalk adjacent to 360 Market Square.

==Events==
Market Square Arena was best known as the home of the Indiana Pacers of the American Basketball Association and National Basketball Association from 1974 to 1999.

The first Pacers basketball game held in the arena was a preseason game against the Milwaukee Bucks; the total attendance was 16,929. The first regular-season ABA game in the arena was held on October 18, 1974, against the San Antonio Spurs; the Pacers lost in double overtime, 129–121 in front of 7,473 fans. The first Pacers victory in Market Square Arena came on October 23 with a 122–107 win over the Spirits of St. Louis. The 1974–75 season ended for the Pacers with the ABA Finals played in Market Square Arena and Freedom Hall against their archrivals, the Kentucky Colonels. The Colonels defeated the Pacers in that championship series, winning the ABA title in five games (4 wins to 1). The 1975–76 Pacers won their final home ABA game in Market Square Arena with a 109–95 victory against the Colonels. (Kentucky won the next game by one point to win the series and advance, ending the Pacers&#x27; ABA tenure.) The Pacers continued to play at Market Square Arena after they joined the NBA in 1976; their first game at the arena as an NBA team was a 129–122 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on October 21. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return to the Chicago Bulls after his first retirement took place at Market Square Arena in a loss to the Pacers on March 19, 1995.

The arena also hosted the 1980 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball Final Four, which was won by the University of Louisville. and the Midwestern Collegiate Conference (now Horizon League) men&#x27;s basketball conference tournament from 1986 to 1988 and again in 1993.

In 1987, Indianapolis hosted the Pan American Games, and all of its basketball games were held at Market Square. The gold-medal game pitted Brazil against the United States. The U.S. team of college players featured two All-Americans in David Robinson and Danny Manning, two Final Four MVPs in Pervis Ellison and Keith Smart, and several other future NBA players. The U.S. team led 68–54 at halftime, but Oscar Schmidt led Brazil to a stunning comeback, finishing with 46 points as Brazil won 120–115.

Market Square Arena was the primary concert venue for virtually all national and international musical acts visiting Indiana until its demolition in 2001. While many concerts moved to the Deer Creek Music Center amphitheater during summer months after that venue opened in 1989, Market Square remained the primary concert venue for large acts visiting the city of Indianapolis. Market Square hosted acts from Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Eric Clapton, Kenny Rogers, Deep Purple, Cheap Trick, Grateful Dead, KISS, Metallica, and several Black Expo performances.

Other events held at Market Square included circuses, Ice Capades, monster truck shows, indoor motocross racing, and rodeos.

Market Square Arena was also the home of the Indianapolis Racers of the WHA from 1974 to 1979. 17-year-old Wayne Gretzky starred for the Racers in his first professional action before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers after a handful of games.

As part of a series of 24 NHL games held in non-league markets during the 1992-93 season, the arena hosted its first NHL game on November 3, 1992, a matchup between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Washington Capitals.

<text>Herbert Mitchell Muschamp (November 28, 1947 – October 2, 2007) was an American architecture critic.

== Early years ==
Born in Philadelphia, Muschamp described his childhood home life as follows: &quot;The living room was a secret. A forbidden zone. The new slipcovers were not, in fact, the reason why sitting down there was taboo. That was just the cover story. It was used to conceal the inability of family members to hold a conversation. Who knew what other secrets might come tumbling out if they actually sat down and talked? The cause of Mother&#x27;s headaches might come up.&quot;

This motivated Muschamp to engage in boisterous conversations outside the home in later years, particularly in the company of such up-and-coming architects as Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, Bernard Tschumi and Tod Williams, which formed the basis for his perceptive and often vehement architectural commentary and criticism.

Muschamp attended the University of Pennsylvania but dropped out after two years to move to New York City, where he was a regular at Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory. He later attended Parsons School of Design, where he studied architecture, and returned to teach after spending some time studying at the Architectural Association in London.

== Career ==
During this period, he began writing architectural criticism for various magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, and &quot;Art Forum&quot;. He was appointed the architecture critic for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1987.

Muschamp became the architecture critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1992, succeeding Paul Goldberger. During his controversial tenure at the &quot;Times&quot;, Muschamp rose, according to Nicolai Ouroussoff, to preeminence as the nation&#x27;s foremost judge of the architecture world. His writing championed now-famous architects such as Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Zaha Hadid and Jean Nouvel, as well as architects that he regarded as rising talents, including Greg Lynn, Lindy Roy, Jesse Reiser, Nanako Umemoto and Casagrande &amp; Rintala.

His detractors, noted the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, argued that his conflicts of interest, from socializing with his subjects frequently, and his &quot;iconoclasm and obscurantism, his unapologetic dilettantism&quot; were along with his &quot;very public break downs&quot; a source of a &quot;fall from grace.&quot;

Muschamp was a lover of cities. One of his most often quoted lines came from a 2004 review: &quot;A city is never more fully human than when expertise – our own or someone else&#x27;s – allows us access to ebullience, lightness and delight.&quot; He spent a number of columns criticizing the new master plan for the World Trade Center site, calling the plan produced by Daniel Libeskind an embodiment of the &quot;Orwellian condition America&#x27;s detractors accuse us of embracing: perpetual war for perpetual peace.&quot;

He stepped down as the architecture critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004 to write the &quot;Icons&quot; column for the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;T Style Magazine&quot;, among other features. He was replaced by his protégé, Nicolai Ouroussoff. Muschamp was openly gay, and the centrality of gay men in the cultural life of New York City was central to his writing. He continued to write until his death from lung cancer in Manhattan in 2007.

A book collection of Muschamp&#x27;s writings, &quot;Hearts of the City: The Selected Writings of Herbert Muschamp,&quot; was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2010.

<doc id="768402" wikidata="Q15099738" url="?curid=768402" title="Rhynchocephalia">
<text>Rhynchocephalia (; ) is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only one living species, the tuatara (&quot;Sphenodon punctatus&quot;) of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, during the Mesozoic rhynchocephalians were a speciose group with high morphological and ecological diversity. The oldest record of the group is dated to the Middle Triassic around 238 to 240 million years ago, and they had achieved global distribution by the Early Jurassic. Most rhynchocephalians belong to the group Sphenodontia (&#x27;wedge-teeth&#x27;). Their closest living relatives are lizards and snakes in the order Squamata, with the two orders being grouped together in the superorder Lepidosauria.

Rhynchocephalians are distinguished from squamates by a number of traits, including the retention of rib-like gastralia bones in the belly, as well as most rhynchocephalians having acrodont teeth that are fused to the crests of the jaws (the latter also found among a small number of modern lizard groups like agamids).

Once representing the world&#x27;s dominant group of small reptiles, many of the niches occupied by lizards today were held by rhynchocephalians during the Triassic and Jurassic. Rhynchocephalians underwent a great decline during the Cretaceous, and they had disappeared almost entirely by the beginning of the Cenozoic. While the modern tuatara is primarily insectivorous and carnivorous, the diversity of the group also included the herbivorous eilenodontines, and there were other rhynchocephalians with specialised ecologies like the durophagous sapheosaurs. There were even successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians, such as the pleurosaurs.

Tuatara were originally classified as agamid lizards when they were first described by John Edward Gray in 1831. They remained misclassified until 1867, when Albert Günther of the British Museum noted features similar to birds, turtles, and crocodiles. He proposed the order Rhynchocephalia (from Ancient Greek (&#x27;) &#x27;beak&#x27; and (&#x27;) &#x27;head&#x27;, meaning &quot;beak head&quot;) for the tuatara and its fossil relatives. In 1925, Samuel Wendell Williston proposed the Sphenodontia to include only tuatara and their closest fossil relatives. &quot;Sphenodon&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek (&#x27;) &#x27;wedge&#x27; and (&#x27;) &#x27;tooth&#x27;. Many disparately related species were subsequently added to the Rhynchocephalia, resulting in what taxonomists call a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. These include the superficially similar (both in shape and name) but unrelated rhynchosaurs, which lived in the Triassic. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated that rhynchosaurs were unrelated, with computer-based cladistic analysis conducted in the 1980s providing a robust diagnosis for the definition of the group.

== Anatomy ==
Rhynchocephalia and their sister group Squamata (which includes lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians) belong to the superorder Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha.

Squamates and rhynchocephalians have a number of shared traits (synapomorphies), including fracture planes within the tail vertebrae allowing caudal autotomy (loss of the tail when threatened), transverse cloacal slits, an opening in the pelvis known as the thyroid fenestra, the presence of extra ossification centres in the limb bone epiphyses, a knee joint where a lateral recess on the femur allows the articulation of the fibula, the development of a sexual segment of the kidney, and a number of traits of the feet bones, including a fused astralago-calcaneun and enlarged fourth distal tarsal, which creates a new joint, along with a hooked fifth metatarsal.

Like some lizards, the tuatara possesses a parietal eye (also called a pineal eye or a third eye) covered by scales at the top of the head formed by the parapineal organ, with an accompanying hole in the skull roof enclosed by the parietal bones, dubbed the &quot;pineal foramen&quot;, which is also present in fossil rhynchocephalians. The parietal eye detects light (though it is probably not capable of detecting movement or forming images), monitoring the day-night and seasonal cycles, helping to regulate the circadian rhythm, among other functions. While parietal eyes were widespread among early vertebrates, including early reptiles, they have been lost among most living groups.

Rhynchocephalians are distinguished from squamates by a number of traits, including the retention of gastralia (rib-like bones present in the belly of the body, ancestrally present in tetrapods and also present in living crocodilians). Unlike squamates, but similar to the majority of birds, the tuatara lacks a penis. This is a secondary loss, as a penis or squamate-like hemipenes were probably present in the last common ancestor of rhynchocephalians and squamates.
The complete lower temporal bar (caused by the fusion of the jugal and quadtrate/quadratojugal bones of the skull) of the tuatara, often historically asserted to be a primitive feature retained from earlier reptiles, is actually a derived feature among sphenodontians, with primitive lepidosauromorphs and many rhynchocephalians including the most primitive ones having an open lower temporal fenestra without a temporal bar. While often lacking a complete temporal bar, the vast majority of rhynchocephalians have a posteriorly directed process (extension) of the jugal bone. All known rhynchocephalians lack the splenial bone present in the lower jaw of more primitive reptiles, with the skulls of all members of Sphenodontia lacking lacrimal bones. The majority of rhynchocephalians also have fused frontal bones of the skull. While early rhynchocephalians possessed a tympanic membrane in the ear and a corresponding quadrate conch, similar to those found in lizards, these have been lost in the tuatara and likely other derived rhynchocephalians. This loss may be connected to the development of back and forth motion of the lower jaw. 
The dentition of most rhynchocephalians, including the tuatara, is described as acrodont, which is associated with the condition of the teeth being attached to the crest of the jaw bone, lacking tooth replacement and having extensive bone growth fusing the teeth to the jaws resulting in the boundary between the teeth and bone being difficult to discern. This differs from the condition found in most lizards (except acrodontans), which have pleurodont teeth which are attached to the shelf on the inward-facing side of the jaw, and are replaced throughout life. The teeth of the tuatara have no roots, though the teeth of some other rhynchocephalians possess roots. The acrodont dentition appears to be a derived character of rhynchocephalians not found in more primitive lepidosauromorphs. The most primitive rhynchocephalians have either pleurodont teeth or a combination of both pleurodont front and acrodont posterior teeth. Some rhynchocephalians differ from these conditions, with &quot;Ankylosphenodon&quot; having superficially acrodont teeth that continue deeply into the jaw bone, and are fused to the bone at the base of the socket (ankylothecodont). In many derived sphenodontians, the premaxillary teeth at the front of the upper jaw are merged into a large chisel-like structure.

Rhynchocephalians possess palatal dentition (teeth present on the bones of the roof of the mouth). Palatal teeth are ancestrally present in tetrapods, but have been lost in many groups. The earliest rhynchocephalians had teeth present on the palatine, vomer and pterygoid bones, though the vomer and/or the pterygoid teeth are lost in some groups, including the living tuatara, which only has palatine teeth. A distinctive character found in all rhynchocephalians is the enlargement of the tooth row present on the palatine bones. While in other rhynchocephalians the palatine tooth row is oblique to the teeth of the maxilla, in members of Sphenodontinae (including the tuatara) and Eilenodontinae it is orientated parallel to the maxilla. In these groups, during biting, the teeth of the dentary in the lower jaw slot between the maxillary and palatine tooth rows. This arrangement, which is unique among amniotes, permits three point bending of food items, and in combination with propalinal movement (back and forward motion of the lower jaw) allows for a shearing bite.

The body size of rhynchocephalians is highly variable. The tuatara has an average total length of for females and males respectively. &quot;Clevosaurus sectumsemper&quot; has an estimated total length of , while large individuals of the largest known terrestrial sphenodontian, &quot;Priosphenodon avelasi&quot; reached total lengths of just over . The aquatic pleurosaurs reached lengths of up to .

The tuatara has among the highest known ages of sexual maturity among reptiles, at around 9 to 13 years of age, and has a high longevity in comparison to lizards of similar size, with wild individuals likely reaching 70 years, and possibly over 100 years in age. Such a late onset of sexual maturity and longevity may have or not have been typical of extinct rhynchocephalians.

== Classification ==

While the grouping of Rhynchocephalia is well supported, the relationships of many taxa to each other are uncertain, varying substantially between studies. In modern cladistics, the clade Sphenodontia includes all rhynchocephalians other than &quot;Wirtembergia,&quot; as well as &quot;Gephyrosaurus&quot; and other gephyrosaurids. Gephyrosaurids have been found as more closely related to squamates in some analyses. In 2018, two major clades within Sphenodontia were defined, the infraorder Eusphenodontia which is defined by the least inclusive clade containing &quot;Polysphenodon, Clevosaurus hudsoni&quot; and &quot;Sphenodon&quot;, which is supported by the presence of three synapomorphies, including the presence of clearly visible wear facets on the teeth of the dentary or maxilla, the premaxillary teeth are merged into a chisel like structure, and the palatine teeth are reduced to a single tooth row, with the presence of an additional isolated tooth. The unranked clade Neosphenodontia is defined as the most inclusive clade containing &quot;Sphenodon&quot; but not &quot;Clevosaurus hudsoni,&quot; which is supported by the presence of six synapomorphies, including the increased relative length of the antorbital region of the skull (the part of the skull forward of the eye socket), reaching 1/4 to 1/3 of the total skull length, the posterior (hind) edge of the parietal bone is only slightly curved inward, the parietal foramen is found at the same level or forward of the anterior border of the supratemporal fenestra (an opening of the skull), the palatine teeth are further reduced from the condition in eusphenodontians to a single lateral tooth row, the number of pterygoid tooth rows are reduced to one or none, and the posterior border of the ischium is characterised by a distinctive process. In 2021 the clade Acrosphenodontia was defined, which is less inclusive than Sphenodontia and more inclusive than Eusphenodontia, and includes all sphenodontians with fully acrodont dentition, excluding basal partially acrodont sphenodontians. In 2022 the extinct clade Leptorhynchia was defined, including a variety of neosphenodontians, at least some of which were aquatically adapted, characterised by the elongation of the fourth metacarpal, the presence of a posterior process on the ischium, and the antorbital region of the skulls is between a third and a quarter of the total skull length. The clade Opisthodontia has been used for the grouping of all sphenodontians more closely related to &quot;Priosphenodon&quot; (a member of Eilenodontinae) than to &quot;Sphenodon.&quot; Not all studies use this clade, as some studies have found the scope of the clade to be identical to Eilenodontinae.

The family Sphenodontidae has been used to include the tuatara and its closest relatives within Rhynchocephalia. However the grouping has lacked a formal definition, with the included taxa varying substantially between analyses. The closest relatives of the tuatara are placed in the clade Sphenodontinae, which are characterised by a completely closed temporal bar.

== Ecology ==
The fossil record of rhynchocephalians demonstrates that they were a diverse group that exploited a wide array of ecological niches. Early rhynchocephalians possess small ovoid teeth designed for piercing, and were probably insectivores. Like modern tuatara, extinct members of Sphenodontinae were likely generalists with a carnivorous/insectivorous diet. Amongst the most distinct rhynchocephalians are the pleurosaurs, known from the Jurassic of Europe, which were adapted for marine life, with elongated snake-like bodies with reduced limbs, with the specialised Late Jurassic genus &quot;Pleurosaurus&quot; having an elongated triangular skull highly modified from those of other rhynchocephalians. Pleurosaurs are thought to have been piscivores (consuming fish). Several other lineages of rhynchocephalians have been suggested to have had semi-aquatic habits. Eilenodontines are thought to have been herbivorous, with batteries of wide teeth with thick enamel used to process plant material. The sapheosaurids, such as &quot;Oenosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sapheosaurus&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Europe possess broad tooth plates unique amongst tetrapods, and are thought to have been durophagous, with the tooth plates being used to crush hard shelled organisms. &quot;Sphenovipera&quot; from the Jurassic of Mexico has been suggested to have been venomous, based on presence of grooves on two enlarged teeth at the front of the lower jaw though this interpretation has been questioned by other authors. The body of &quot;Pamizinsaurus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of Mexico was covered in osteoscutes, similar to those of helodermatid lizards like the Gila monster, which is unique among known sphenodontians, which probably served to protect it against predators.

== Evolutionary history ==

The timing of when Rhynchocephalia is estimated to have diverged from Squamata is disputed. Older estimates place the divergence between the Middle Permian and earliest Triassic, around 270 to 252 million years ago, while other authors posit a younger date of around 242 million years ago. The oldest known remains of rhynchocephalians are those of &quot;Wirtembergia&quot; known from the Erfurt Formation near Vellberg in Southern Germany, dating to the Ladinian stage of the Middle Triassic, around 238-240 million years old, which is also the most primitive rhynchocephalian known. Rhynchocephalians underwent considerable diversification during the Late Triassic, and reached a worldwide distribution across Pangaea by the end of the Triassic, with the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic genus &quot;Clevosaurus&quot; having 10 species across Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America. The earliest rhynchocephalians were small animals, but by the Late Triassic the group had evolved a wide range of body sizes. During the Jurassic, rhynchocephalians were the dominant group of small reptiles globally, reaching their apex of morphological diversity during this period, including specialised herbivorous and aquatic forms. The only record of Rhynchocephalians from Asia (excluding the Indian subcontinent, which was not part of Asia during the Mesozoic) are indeterminate remains of &quot;Clevosaurus&quot; from the Early Jurassic (Sinemurian) aged Lufeng Formation of Yunnan, China. Rhynchocephalians are noticeably absent from younger localities in the region, despite the presence of favourable preservation conditions. Rhynchocephalians remained diverse into the Late Jurassic, and were more abundant than lizards during the Late Jurassic in North America.

Rhynchocephalian diversity declined during the Early Cretaceous, disappearing from North America and Europe after the end of the epoch, and were absent from North Africa and northern South America by the early Late Cretaceous. The cause of the decline of Rhynchocephalia remains unclear, but has often been suggested to be due to competition with advanced lizards and mammals. They appear to have remained prevalent in southern South America during the Late Cretaceous, where lizards remained rare, with their remains outnumbering terrestrial lizards in this region by a factor of 200. Late Cretaceous South American sphenodontians are represented by both Eilenodontinae and Sphenodontidae (including Sphenodontinae). An indeterminate rhynchocephalian is known from a partial lower jaw of a hatchling from the latest Cretaceous or possibly earliest Paleocene Intertrappean Beds, in what was then the isolated landmass of Insular India, which appears to be an acrosphenodontian, possibly related to &quot;Godavarisaurus&quot; from the Jurassic of India. The youngest undoubted remains of rhynchocephalians outside of New Zealand are those of the sphenodontid &quot;Kawasphenodon peligrensis&quot; from the early Paleocene (Danian) of Patagonia, shortly after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Indeterminate sphenodontine jaw fragments bearing teeth are known from the early Miocene (19–16 million years ago) St Bathans fauna, New Zealand, that are indistinguishable from those of the living tuatara. It is unlikely that the ancestors of the tuatara arrived in New Zealand via oceanic dispersal, and it is thought that they were already present in New Zealand when it separated from Antarctica between 80 and 66 million years ago.

<text>A car seat is a seat used in automobiles. Most car seats are made from inexpensive but durable material in order to withstand prolonged use. The most common material is polyester.

== Bucket seat and bench seat ==

A bucket seat is a separate seat with a contoured platform designed to accommodate one person, distinct from a bench seat that is a flat platform designed to seat up to three people. Individual bucket seats typically have rounded backs and may offer a variety of adjustments to fit different passengers.

==Folding seats==

Early touring cars featured folding auxiliary seats to offer additional passenger capacity. Some early automobiles were available with an exterior rumble seat that folded open into an upholstered seat for one or two passengers.

Some vehicle models offer rear seats, to gain cargo space when they are not occupied by passengers.

A fold-down front-passenger seat was a feature on the Chrysler PT Cruiser to fit longer items such as a ladder inside the vehicle.

==Ergonomics: lumbar and thigh support==
The lumbar is the region of the spine between the diaphragm and the pelvis; it supports the most weight and is the most flexible. The adjustable lumbar mechanisms in seats allow the user to change the seat back shape in this region, to make it more comfortable and include adjustable lumbar cushion. Some seats are long enough to support full thigh and follow back curves.

==Safety==
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act enacted by the U.S. in 1966 established standards of strength for automobile seats. These included requirements for proper anchorage and construction of automobile vehicle seat assemblies. The legal requirements in some jurisdictions for a child to sit up front is and they must weigh more than . Some studies have shown that drivers have an aversion towards carrying the full capacity number of passengers due to concerns over insufficient vision through the back window.

* An anti-submarine seat is a kind of seat that incorporates specially shaped panels in the forward edge of the seat cushion, reducing the tendency for the occupant to slide beneath the seatbelt in a severe frontal collision. Anti-submarine seating is a safety feature that may be more important for the front seats than the rear seats.
* A child safety seat or child restraint system is a restraint which is secured to the seat of an automobile equipped with safety harnesses or seat belts, to hold a child in the event of a crash. All 50 states require child seats with specific criteria. Requirements vary based on a child&#x27;s age, weight and height. The National Child Passenger Safety Board, managed by the National Safety Council, maintains the quality and integrity of the National Child Passenger Safety Certification Training Program. The program is used to train and certify child passenger safety technicians and instructors in order to assist caregivers in safe transportation of children.

Side airbags are often built right into the outer edge of the seatback. Seats so equipped should not be covered which impedes the operation of the airbag.

==Power seats==

Some car seat systems are set up with a battery-powered automatic control to adjust how the seat sits in the car.

In suitably equipped cars, seats and mirrors can be adjusted using electric controls. Some vehicles let the driver(s) save the adjustments in memory (memory seat) for later recall, with the push of a button. Most systems allow users to store more than one set of adjustments. This allows multiple drivers to store their comfort settings, or a single driver to store several different occupant positions. Some vehicles associate memorized settings with a specifically numbered, remotely operated key fob, resetting a seat to the position associated with that fob when the vehicle is unlocked (e.g. key fob #1 sets seats to memory position #1, #2 to #2, etc.).

==Covers==

Car seat covers are accessories that protect the original seat upholstery from wear and add a custom look to a vehicle&#x27;s interior. They can help to maintain the resale value of the vehicle and maximize the comfort of the driver and passengers.

==Seat construction==

==Climate control and ventilation==
Some vehicles includes the option of seat climate control (i.e. heating by seat warmers or cooling) and ventilation. Ventilation was introduced in 1997 by Saab and heating by Cadillac in 1966. In 2023 BMW pulled out of a plan to implement a subscription model on their heated seats due to public backlash.

<doc id="768407" wikidata="Q549437" url="?curid=768407" title="Veterans Memorial Coliseum (Portland, Oregon)">
<text>The Veterans Memorial Coliseum (originally known as the Memorial Coliseum) is an indoor arena located in the oldest part of the Rose Quarter area in Portland, Oregon. The arena is the home of the Portland Winterhawks, a major junior ice hockey team, and was the original home of the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. It has been included on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its architectural significance.

==Tenants==
From 1960 to 1974 the Memorial Coliseum was the home of the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League, and it was the venue for the Final Four of the NCAA basketball tournament in March 1965, where UCLA won its second of ten such championships in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Portland Trail Blazers===

When the Portland Trail Blazers franchise was awarded in 1970, the Memorial Coliseum became the team&#x27;s home court, capable of seating 12,666 when configured for basketball. Three NBA Finals have been played in the Coliseum; in 1977 (when the Trail Blazers won) and in 1990 and 1992. The Blazers were 10–0 in the Coliseum during the 1977 playoffs, including the clincher in Game 6 of the Finals. The Detroit Pistons were the only visiting team to win the championship at the Coliseum, claiming their second consecutive championship in Game 5 of the 1990 Finals.

In 1974, Gerald Ford became the first president of the United States to attend an NBA game. On November 1 at Memorial Coliseum, he arrived in the third quarter and watched the Trail Blazers defeat the Buffalo Braves, 113–106.

Construction began on the nearby Rose Garden Arena (now Moda Center) soon after the 1992 NBA Finals, and it became the team&#x27;s home arena when it opened in 1995.

As part of the team&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebration, the Blazers played a pre-season game at Memorial Coliseum on October 14, 2009, against the Phoenix Suns. Team founder Harry Glickman, former players Jerome Kersey, Terry Porter, and Bob Gross, as well as broadcaster Bill Schonely attended the game. The Suns defeated the Blazers, 110–104, with 11,740 tickets sold.

In 2019, the Portland Trail Blazers celebrated their 50th season anniversary of becoming an NBA franchise. The organization played their first preseason game of the 2019–2020 season at the Memorial Coliseum on October 8, against the Denver Nuggets as a tribute to the stadium that the Trail Blazers called home for 25 years.

===Portland Winterhawks===
The building is currently the home arena of the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, which used to split its schedule with the Moda Center prior to 2021. In August 2007, the City of Portland and the Portland Winterhawks reached an agreement to have replay screens installed in the main center ice scoreboard in time for the 2007–2008 hockey season. The city agreed to rent the screens, which are owned by the Winterhawks, for the first year, and then either buy them outright or replace them with different screens in 2008–09. Other improvements included adding a beer garden area, replacing graphic displays, and general painting and repairs.

Prior to the start of the 2021-22 WHL season, the Winterhawks announced they will be playing at Veterans Memorial Coliseum full-time.

===Other occupants===
The original Portland Timbers of the NASL played indoor soccer at the coliseum from 1979 to 1982. The Portland Power of the American Basketball League played in the Coliseum from 1996 to 1998. It hosted the OSAA 4A Men&#x27;s State Basketball Tournament in March 1966 – 2003 and the March 2005 Big Sky Conference Basketball Tournament. The Memorial Coliseum hosts the Oregon High School Hockey League; local high school ice hockey teams play a few games each season and it also hosts some other events such as conventions, touring shows, and high school graduations. The Memorial Coliseum also hosts the OSAA High School Dance and Drill team State Championships every year in March. It has also hosted the FIRST Robotics Competition Pacific Northwest district championship event every other year, most recently in 2024.

==Major events==

The Memorial Coliseum was designed with large doors at both ends to accommodate the floats of the Portland Rose Festival&#x27;s Grand Floral Parade. The parade begins at the Memorial Coliseum, where paying guests watch the parade cross the Coliseum&#x27;s floor from reserved seats inside and from bleachers outside. The Rose Festival Queen&#x27;s coronation has also been held in the facility since 1961.

On August 22, 1965, The Beatles played two shows at Memorial Coliseum to 20,000 screaming fans as part of their 1965 American Tour. Allen Ginsberg, who was in the audience, wrote a poem about the event called &quot;Portland Coliseum&quot;. Led Zeppelin performed at the Coliseum on May 7, 1969, during their second North American concert tour and returned during their fifth and eighth tours in 1970 and 1972, respectively. The Monkees performed at the coliseum on August 26, 1967.

Elvis Presley performed at Memorial Coliseum on November 11, 1970, April 27, 1973, And Again on November 26, 1976, in front of 12,000 13,000 and 11,000 fans, respectively. The Bee Gees performed two sold-out concerts on July 17 and 18, 1979, as part of their successful Spirits Having Flown Tour.

Bon Jovi played at the Memorial Coliseum for two consecutive nights as part of their New Jersey Syndicate Tour. During these shows on May 8, 1989, and May 9, 1989, the band recorded most of the footage for their music video Lay Your Hands On Me.

A political rally for 2000 presidential candidate Ralph Nader sold 10,500 $7-tickets at the venue on August 26, 2000, with every seat sold except those behind the stage. President Barack Obama spoke at the Memorial Coliseum on March 21, 2008, before winning the Democratic Nomination.

===Dew Tour===
In 2004, Portland was selected as one of five cities in the U.S. to host the Dew Tour, an extreme sports franchise started in 2005. Titled the Vans Invitational, the event was held at the Rose Quarter August 17–21, 2005. The Memorial Coliseum hosted &quot;BMX: Park&quot;, &quot;BMX: Vert&quot;, &quot;Skateboard: Park&quot;, and &quot;Skateboard: Vert&quot;. The Dew Tour returned to the Rose Quarter again with the Wendy&#x27;s Invitational on August 12–15, 2010, marking the tour&#x27;s sixth year in Portland, which is the only city that has qualified to host the tour in every year since its inception.

===Davis Cup Tennis final===
From November 30 through December 2, 2007, the Memorial Coliseum hosted the 2007 Davis Cup Tennis final between the USA and Russia.

==History==

Financed by an $8 million bond approved by voters in 1954, construction was completed by Hoffman Construction in 1960 and dedicated on January 8, 1961, to the &quot;advancement of cultural opportunities for the community and to the memory of our veterans of all wars who made the supreme sacrifice.&quot; The facility is tall and has a footprint of about . It is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; in Portland. The building was designed by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.

Original plans called for a building made of wood, which is plentiful in the region, but cost and safety factors precluded that. The structure instead consists of a modernistic gray glass and aluminum, non-load-bearing curtain-wall cube around a central ovular concrete seating bowl. Four concrete piers support the steel roof, with no interior columns required. The exterior appearance, with of glass, is of a skyscraper laid on its side. The curtain-wall windows inside offer views of the city in all directions. The black curtains can be closed to block sunlight in 90 seconds. Seating includes 9,000 permanent seats expandable to 14,000 with portable chairs and bleachers. At its opening, it was called the largest multipurpose facility of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.

The war memorial consists of two black granite walls below ground level and near the main gate. The names of the dead are inscribed in gold paint, now faded with age. There are no dates given, only the names and an inscription: &quot;To the memory of a supreme sacrifice we honor those who gave their lives for God, principle and love of country&quot;.

The International Style glass and concrete building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 2009.

In 2011, the Portland City Council voted to change the name of the arena from Memorial Coliseum to Veterans Memorial Coliseum, to better reflect its history as a memorial to war veterans, and as part of the larger Rose Quarter Development project.

The seating capacity for basketball has been as follows:
In 2018, Avantika Bawa had a solo exhibition of drawings and prints of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum at the Portland Art Museum, as part of the APEX series curated by Grace Kook-Anderson.

==Future==
It was proposed that Memorial Coliseum be demolished to make room for a 9,000-seat new ballpark for Merritt Paulson&#x27;s Portland Beavers baseball team, since the team was moving from PGE Park to make room for the new Portland Timbers Major League Soccer franchise, also a Paulson-owned team. There had been talk about using two of the outer glass walls as part of the exterior for a new ballpark. Opposition to razing Memorial Coliseum included some veterans and architectural historians who successfully applied for National Register of Historic Places status for the building. Former governor Vic Atiyeh also opposed demolition if it led to the veteran memorial being forgotten. The Memorial Coliseum was given a rank of the highest importance in the city&#x27;s historic resource inventory of 1984. The proposal to demolish Memorial Coliseum was dropped early in May 2009 with Lents Park being re-considered as a ballpark site.

Other proposed uses of the grounds include turning the site into an entertainment district, a recreation center, a retail center, or a multilevel center for arts, athletics, and education. Another possibility is to update and repair the facility to improve its marketability. In December 2011, it was announced that the Coliseum will undergo a $30 million renovation, partially paid for by the city and partially by the Winterhawks. The renovations would be completed in the spring and summer of 2012.

<doc id="768413" wikidata="Q7362" url="?curid=768413" title="Ear">
<text>In vertebrates, an ear is the organ that enables hearing and (in mammals) body balance using the vestibular system. In humans, the ear is described as having three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the auricle and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear, the word &quot;ear&quot; often refers to the external part (auricle) alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ear canal is cleaned via earwax, which naturally migrates to the auricle. 

The ear develops from the first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from the ectoderm.

The ear may be affected by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.

The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewelry in numerous cultures for thousands of years, and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations.

==Structure==
The human ear consists of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle ear by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.

===Outer ear===

The outer ear is the external portion of the ear and includes the fleshy visible auricle, the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).

The auricle consists of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region in front of the ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum, while the surrounding skin contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective earwax. Earwax naturally migrates outward through ear canal, constituting a self-cleaning system.

Two sets of muscles are associated with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, as well as to the external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.

The auricle consists of a single piece of elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin&#x27;s tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe consists of areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies, which are connected via pathways to both ears.
===Middle ear===
The middle ear lies between the outer ear and the inner ear. It consists of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.

The three ossicles transmit sound from the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.

The round window allows for the fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the secondary tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.

===Inner ear===

The inner ear sits within the temporal bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, called the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled at right angles to each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.

The bony labyrinth refers to the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli are present in the organ of Corti in the cochlea.

===Blood supply===
The blood supply of the ear differs according to each part of the ear.

The outer ear is supplied by a number of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.

The middle ear is supplied by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, a branch of the maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.

The inner ear is supplied by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.

==Functions==

===Hearing===

Sound waves travel through the outer ear, are modulated by the middle ear, and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear. This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.

Sound that travels through the outer ear impacts on the eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three ossicles bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window), which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.

The inner ear houses the apparatus necessary to change the vibrations transmitted from the outside world via the middle ear into signals passed along the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain. The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid, and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells. The microscopic &quot;hairs&quot; of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid. The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated. Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti. The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium-rich endolymph. This causes the cell to depolarise, and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain.

The human ear can generally hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds outside this range are considered infrasound (below 20 Hz) or ultrasound (above 20 kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory portion of the central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.

===Balance===

Providing balance, when moving or stationary, is also a central function of the ear. The ear facilitates two types of balance: static balance, which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity, and dynamic balance, which allows a person to sense acceleration.

Static balance is provided by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters the positions of the filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.

Dynamic balance is provided through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At the end of each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

==Development==
During embryogenesis, the ear develops as three distinct structures: the inner ear, the middle ear and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.

===Inner ear===

Around its second to third week, the developing embryo consists of three layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The first part of the ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the embryo&#x27;s 22nd day, derived from two thickenings called otic placodes on either side of the head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass is eventually surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.

Around the 28th day, parts of the otic vesicle begin to form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons, which supply sensation to parts of the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti).

Around the 33rd day, the vesicles begin to differentiate. Posteriorly, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Anteriorly, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which eventually becomes the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule eventually gives rise and connects to the cochlear duct, which appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.

As the cochlear duct&#x27;s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph, while the scala media contains endolymph. The vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate the cochlear duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.

;Molecular regulation
Most of the genes responsible for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis are members of the homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.

===Middle ear===
The middle ear and its components develop from the first and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from the first part of the pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually, cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.

===Outer ear===

Unlike structures of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded by the end of the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The auricle originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms, they move towards their final position level with the eyes.

===Growth===
The ears of newborn humans are proportionally very large, even more so than the head&#x27;s largeness as compared to the body. Ears grow quickly until about the age of nine, then continue to grow steadily in circumference (about 0.5 millimeters a year) throughout life, with the increase in length more extreme in males.

=== Uniqueness ===
Ears are individually very unique, with the odds of two people having matching ears very low. Additionally, the ear&#x27;s proportions are normally retained for life, and have thus been employed for forensic identification since the 1950s.

==Clinical significance==

===Hearing loss===
Hearing loss may be either partial or total. This may be a result of injury or damage, congenital disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.
Causes of conductive hearing loss include an ear canal blocked by earwax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear&#x27;s eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.

Hearing aids or cochlear implants may be used if the hearing loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying the sound of the local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard as if it were a nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea. Active middle ear implants send sound vibrations to the ossicles in the middle ear, bypassing any non-functioning parts of the outer and middle ear.

===Congenital abnormalities===
Anomalies and malformations of the auricle are common. These anomalies include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children may also present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases, no auricle is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small auricles can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop if it does not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby&#x27;s hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs of the rest of the ear.

Approximately one out of one thousand children suffer some type of congenital deafness related to the development of the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.

===Vertigo===

Vertigo refers to the inappropriate perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière&#x27;s disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result in the perception of vertigo.

===Injury===
;Outer ear
Injuries to the external ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, the external ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.

;Middle ear
The ear drum may become perforated in the event of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.

;Inner ear
There are two principal damage mechanisms to the inner ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), and the second is exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.

=== Tinnitus ===
Tinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present. While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.

Tinnitus is not a disease but a symptom that can result from a number of underlying causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière&#x27;s disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It is more common in those with depression and anxiety.

==Society and culture==
The ears have been ornamented with jewelry for thousands of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.

Injury to the ears has been present since Roman times as a method of reprimand or punishment – &quot;In Roman times, when a dispute arose that could not be settled amicably, the injured party cited the name of the person thought to be responsible before the Praetor; if the offender did not appear within the specified time limit, the complainant summoned witnesses to make statements. If they refused, as often happened, the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted. Hence the French expression &quot;&quot;, of which the literal meaning is &quot;to have one&#x27;s ear pulled&quot; and the figurative meaning &quot;to take a lot of persuading&quot;. We use the expression &quot;to tweak (or pull) someone&#x27;s ears&quot; to mean &quot;inflict a punishment&quot;.&quot;

The auricles have an effect on facial appearance. In Western societies, protruding ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first case report in 1881.

Pointy ears are a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as the French croquemitaine, Brazilian curupira or Japanese earth spider. It has been a feature of characters on art as old as that of Ancient Greece and medieval Europe. Pointy ears are a common characteristic of many creatures in the fantasy genre, including elves, faeries, pixies, hobbits, or orcs. They are a characteristic of creatures in the horror genre, such as vampires. Pointy ears are also found in the science fiction genre; for example among the Vulcan and Romulan races of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe and the Nightcrawler character from the X-Men universe.

Georg von Békésy was a Hungarian biophysicist born in Budapest, Hungary. In 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the function of the cochlea in the mammalian hearing organ.

The Vacanti mouse was a laboratory mouse that had what looked like a human ear grown on its back. The &quot;ear&quot; was actually an ear-shaped cartilage structure grown by seeding cow cartilage cells into a biodegradable ear-shaped mold and then implanted under the skin of the mouse; then the cartilage naturally grew by itself. It was developed as an alternative to ear repair or grafting procedures and the results met with much publicity and controversy in 1997.

==Other animals==
The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localization.

All mammals have three auditory ossicles. The external pinna in therian mammals helps direct sound through the ear canal to the eardrum. The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a Fresnel lens, and may be seen in a wide range of animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.

Some large primates such as gorillas and orangutans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear muscles that are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still large enough to be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and it has been said that it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.

In some animals with mobile pinnae (like the horse), each pinna can be aimed independently to better receive the sound. For these animals, the pinnae help localise the direction of the sound source.

The ear, with its blood vessels close to the surface, is an essential thermoregulator in some land mammals, including the elephant, the fox, and the rabbit. There are five types of ear carriage in domestic rabbits, some of which have been bred for exaggerated ear length—a potential health risk that is controlled in some countries. Abnormalities in the skull of a half-lop rabbit were in 1868. In marine mammals, earless seals are one of three groups of Pinnipedia.

===Invertebrates===
Only vertebrate animals have ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using other kinds of sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly &quot;Ormia ochracea&quot; has tympanal organs on each side of her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her &quot;ears&quot; to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly&#x27;s hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50 billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.

Simpler structures allow other arthropods to detect sounds. Spiders and cockroaches, for example, have hairs on their legs, which are used for detecting sound. Caterpillars may also have hairs on their body that perceive vibrations and allow them to respond to sound.

<text>Sporting clays is a form of clay pigeon shooting, often described as &quot;golf with a shotgun&quot; because a typical course includes from 10 to 15 different shooting stations laid out over natural terrain. 

Unlike trap and skeet, which are games of repeatable target presentations, sporting clays simulates the unpredictability of live-quarry shooting, offering a great variety of trajectories, angles, speeds, elevations, distances, and target sizes.

==History==
In the early 1900s, a number of British shooting schools adopted the use of clay targets to practice for driven-game shoots. Sporting Clays was originally used with live pigeons in the early 1900s, until they started using clay targets. When clay target began being used the sport became more popular. Rather than using standard distances, target angles and sizes, sporting clay courses are designed to simulate the hunting of ducks, pheasants, and even rabbits. Sporting clays makes it easier to practice bird hunting in the off-season because you can practice a flight pattern you struggle with or just practice for fun. After, clay target shooting quickly attracted a large following. The first British Open, England&#x27;s premier sporting clays competition, was held in 1925. Sporting Clays was introduced to American shooters by Bob Brister in his feature article in Field &amp; Stream magazine in July 1980. On September 27, 1980, the first Sporting Clays shoot was held at Remington&#x27;s Lordship Gun Club in Connecticut. Ninety shooters participated, including executives from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF). The following spring, at Bob Brister&#x27;s suggestion, the legendary Chris Cradock from England designed a Sporting Clays venue at Remington Farms, which was used to introduce the sport to Outdoor Writers. In 1982, the oldest continuous Sporting Clays competitive event (The Norbert Buchmayer Society annual Gathering of Friends) began and continues to this day. In 1985, the United States Sporting Clays Association (USSCA) was formed in Houston, TX. Also in 1985, the Orvis Company sponsored the first U.S. National Sporting Clays Championship, which was held in Houston, Texas and continues to promote the sport via the annual Orvis Cup held at Sandanona Shooting Grounds. In 1989, the National Skeet Shooting Association (NSSA) in San Antonio, Texas, formed the National Sporting Clays Association (NSCA) to provide governance and promote Sporting Clays. Today sporting clays is one of the fastest growing sports in America, with more than three million people of all ages participating both competitively and recreationally.

Pictures of courses, tower shooting and walk-up (Quail Walk) shooting have frequented magazines in the United States all the way back to 1912. Edward Cave wrote an article in 1913 called &quot;Clay Bird Golf&quot; which included a diagram of his shooting course with all types of target presentations and two towers. The name may have been new in 1980, but the game has been played in America for over 100 years and several of today&#x27;s target arrangements were known to have been used as early as 1884, and probably earlier.

==Equipment and safety==
Because the sport is popular with a wide variety of shotgun enthusiasts, the shotguns used do not fit an exact standard; however, every shotgun used for sporting clays must be capable of shooting two cartridges of 12 gauge or smaller. The most popular shotgun configurations are over-and-under, semiautomatic, and pump-action, using traditional cartridge shot sizes of 9, 8, or 7.5.

Safety is an important part of sporting clays. Proper ear and eye protection are mandatory, and firearms safety procedures, as listed in the National Sporting Clays Association (NSCA) Rule Book, must be followed at all times while on a course.

==Course layout and play==
A typical course consists of 10 to 15 stations, with each station presenting targets from trap machines laid around a field or a trail through the woods, every course will be different. Targets are thrown from any angle or distance, to simulate the flight of a bird and sometimes rabbit. There are six different sizes of targets, ranging from minis to standards. Usually 6 to 10 targets are shot at each station by a squad of up to six shooters for a total outing of 50 to 100 targets per person. Targets are thrown in pairs. A pair of targets may be thrown as a &quot;true pair&quot; (or &quot;sim pair&quot;, i.e., thrown at the same time), as a &quot;following pair&quot; (thrown sequentially), or &quot;on report&quot; (the second clay launched on the firing of the shooter&#x27;s gun). Numerous hunting conditions can be simulated by combining various speeds and angles with different types of clay targets. Each station is unique. Throughout a course, the shooters might see targets crossing from either side, coming inward, going outward, flying straight up, rolling on the ground, arcing high in the air, or thrown from towers. The possible target presentations are limited only by safety considerations, the terrain, and the imagination of the course designer. The configuration of the stations is often changed to maintain interest for the shooters and for environmental preservation of the course.

<doc id="768420" wikidata="Q3729594" url="?curid=768420" title="Hamites (genus)">
<text>Hamites (&quot;hook-like&quot;) is a genus of heteromorph ammonite that evolved late in the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous and lasted into the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The genus is almost certainly paraphyletic but remains in wide use as a &quot;catch all&quot; for heteromorph ammonites of the superfamily Turrilitoidea that do not neatly fit into the more derived groupings. In an attempt to identify clades within the genus, it has been divided up into a series of new genera or subgenera by different palaeontologists, including &quot;Eohamites&quot;, &quot;Hamitella&quot;, &quot;Helicohamites&quot;, &quot;Lytohamites&quot;, &quot;Planohamites&quot;, &quot;Psilohamites&quot;, and &quot;Sziveshamites&quot;.

The type species is &quot;Hamites attenuatus&quot; from the early Albian, named by James Sowerby in his &quot;Mineral Conchology of Great Britain&quot; of 1814, although the genus itself was created by James Parkinson in his 1811 book &quot;Organic Remains of the Former World&quot;. This James Parkinson is best known as the first scientific description of a disease he called the &quot;Shaking Palsy&quot;, now referred to as Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his honour.

==Morphology and ecology==

&quot;Hamites&quot; species are characterised by a shell that began with an open, sometimes helical, regular spiral that either opened into a single large hook, or else formed three parallel shafts that gave the mature shell the approximate appearance of a paper clip. No &quot;Hamites&quot; had spines or other such ornamentation on the shell, but several species appear to have developed apertural modifications when mature; that is, once the ammonite had grown to its final size, the aperture became constricted and was bounded by one or two thickened ribs, known as collars. These have been observed on other ammonites as well, and are assumed to be signs of sexual dimorphism.

The open shell of these ammonites would have made them poor swimmers because of drag, but beyond that fact, very little is certain about their mode of life. It is widely assumed that they were planktonic, perhaps catching small prey in the manner of jellyfish, but repaired shell damage apparently caused by crabs may indicate that they spent at least some time close to the sea floor.

==Phylogeny==

The genus &quot;Hamites&quot; is of particular interest to palaeontologists because the species included in the genus span a wide range of morphologies including ones apparently similar to several more derived groups of heteromorph ammonites. The genus rapidly diversified during the Albian into a number of morphologically distinct lineages that seem to have given rise to at least three other families of heteromorphs, the Baculitidae, Turrilitidae, and Scaphitidae. The lineage that gave rise to the helical Turrilitidae, for example, had a shell that initially grew as a helix before straightening out; the Turrilitidae thus appear to have been derived from neotenic &quot;Hamites&quot; that retained the helically-coiled juvenile morphology of &quot;Hamites&quot; into adulthood.

<doc id="768424" wikidata="Q3305514" url="?curid=768424" title="Memorial Stadium (University of Illinois)">
<text>Memorial Stadium is a stadium on the campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The stadium, used primarily for football, is a memorial to the university&#x27;s students who died in World War I; their names are engraved on the nearly 200 pillars surrounding the stadium&#x27;s façade. With a capacity of 60,670, the stadium is primarily used as the home of the university&#x27;s Fighting Illini football team.

==Construction==

In the early 1920s, the old football stadium, Illinois Field, was deemed inadequate. There was some sentiment for retaining the site, but it was too congested to expand the stadium adequately, so a new site was selected, in a largely undeveloped area at the south end of the campus. George Huff and Robert Zuppke were responsible for pushing most of the fundraising for this project.
Memorial Stadium was completed in 1923 at a cost of US$1.7 million, which, adjusted for inflation, is equal to $25.8 million in 2020. Its original U-shaped design borrows some form from the earlier constructed Harvard Stadium. The project&#x27;s general contractor was English Brothers of Champaign, who are in business to this day. The name was chosen in honor of the dead from World War I. The original construction was financed with donations from University students, alumni and others. At the time, the stadium consisted of double-decked stands on the east and west sidelines. The single-decked horseshoe around the south end zone was later completed, along with a large student section near the north end zone.

According to an archival &quot;campus tours&quot; website, heavy rain during the construction resulted in a bulldozer sinking into the field. It was decided the expense of removing the bulldozer would have been greater than leaving it buried under the field, and it remains there today. However, this has since been disputed as a campus urban legend. Oddly enough, the same myth exists for the University of Michigan Stadium built a few years later, but no evidence has been found to support the rumor.

The bell of the &quot;USS Illinois (BB-65)&quot;, an Iowa-class battleship that was never completed, is on loan to the university and is in use. It is traditionally rung when the Fighting Illini score a touchdown or goal during home games.

==Dedication==
The stadium is dedicated to the men of the University of Illinois that gave their lives serving in World War I. In 2002, the stadium dedication was extended to those who died in World War II. There are a total of 200 columns on the east and west sides of the stadium. 183 columns display one name of a University of Illinois alum that lost their lives in the first war (182 men and 1 woman).

The stadium was officially dedicated on October 18, 1924, on which the university football team played a homecoming game against the University of Michigan. On way to a 39–14 Illini victory, Red Grange scored five touchdowns in one of the greatest single-game performances in football history.

==Tributes==

* The football playing surface within the stadium is named Zuppke Field, in honor of Robert Zuppke, the University of Illinois head football coach from 1913 to 1941.
* The north end of Zuppke Field hosts The Grange Rock, a tribute to Red Grange. The tribute was dedicated on October 22, 1994, with Mrs. Margaret Grange, Red Grange&#x27;s wife, in attendance. The rock came from the same Indiana quarry that produced the stadium&#x27;s columns.
* In 2009, a statue of Red Grange was dedicated as the capstone of the stadium&#x27;s &quot;Illinois Renaissance&quot; renovations.
* The Ray Eliot Varsity Room is named for Ray Eliot, the University of Illinois head football coach from 1942 to 1959.

==Capacity==

The seating capacity of the stadium&#x27;s permanent seating, including the north end zone bleachers, is 60,670. This number was reduced from 62,870 when it was announced on 12 April 2011 that 2,200 south end zone bleacher seats added in 1982 would be removed. The 62,870 number had been reduced from 69,249 as part of the Illinois Renaissance program which was completed in 2008. The east main holds approximately 18,000 with the east balcony adding 10,000. The west main holds less than 13,000 on the first level plus 5,000 in the balcony. The south end zone &quot;horseshoe&quot; holds nearly 9,800 (12,000 before the removal of the aforementioned 2,200 seats), while the north bleachers add 5,000 more seats.

===Attendance records at Memorial Stadium===

===Average attendance since 2001===

==Past renovations==
* A press box was built at the top of the west balcony in 1967.
* As part of the 1974 Golden Anniversary campaign, artificial turf was installed on the field, along with a new lighting system.
* A $7 million renovation began in April 1985. New AstroTurf was installed, along with new football headquarters in the northeast corner of the stadium.
* From November 1991 to August 1992, an $18 million renovation project replaced all concrete bleachers in both the east and west upper decks, along with the top 25 rows of the main stands. New restrooms were built, and the stadium&#x27;s electrical and drainage systems were upgraded to meet new building codes.
* A color scoreboard was added to the north end of the stadium for the 1994 season.
* The stadium&#x27;s AstroTurf was replaced with AstroPlay in 2001.
* In the summer of 2022, the stadium was given a new turf field.

===2008 &quot;Illinois Renaissance&quot; renovation===

A massive renovation project was unveiled for Memorial Stadium in the fall of 2005. The &quot;Illinois Renaissance&quot; project began after the completion of the 2006 football season, and was completed just days before the 2008 season began. The concourse areas on all four sides of the stadium were improved with better concession and restroom facilities. Additionally, the concourse areas were connected all the way around the stadium for easier passage between the east and west stands. A permanent, 5,000-seat structure was built on the north end of the stadium, and the existing scoreboard and video replay screen was moved to the south end zone. The south horseshoe was planned to be filled in down to field level, and would have completely connected the east and west stands. The horseshoe improvements, which were not implemented, would have increased seating to 14,000 seats behind the south end zone. The capacity of the west stands will be significantly reduced in order to build a large press box and luxury suite area at the top of the balcony. The new boxes will be three levels tall and will extend the entire length of the field. The new capacity of the stadium after the renovation will be 62,143. This $100 million project will be largely paid for by sales of the stadium&#x27;s new suites and luxury seating in the west stands. The field also got a new FieldTurf playing surface.

Controversy has arisen over the decision to move the bulk of the student section to the north side of the stadium. Some student overflow seating is set aside on the north end of the east stands. The location may hamper the view of the student section when the ball is at the south end of the field. Critics of the plan suggest this is a move to sell the seats currently occupied by the student section at a higher price to the general public. The planners assert that they are trying to make the field noise louder and cater to the student&#x27;s needs by giving them separate concessions and amenities.

The renovated stadium was rededicated at the 2008 season home opener against Eastern Illinois University on September 6, 2008.

===2013 renovation===

For the start of the 2013 Fighting Illini season, the athletic department replaced the main scoreboard with a new Daktronics video board that measures . Additionally, the stadium&#x27;s sound system was updated and two ribbon video boards were installed along the façade between the upper and lower decks of the stadium&#x27;s sideline seating.

To recognize the Illinois Fighting Illini football&#x27;s historical accomplishments, the athletic department also installed new lettering along the outside of the luxury suites and press box. The lettering lists National Championships, Big Ten Championships, Retired Numbers, and also reads &quot;Welcome to Memorial Stadium&quot; &quot;Home of the Fighting Illini&quot;.

===Future Renovations===
On June 25, 2022, Athletic Director Josh Whitman stated during his annual Media Roundtable Press Conference that he plans to further renovate Memorial Stadium in the near future. Whitman stated, &quot;Obviously, the East and South of Memorial Stadium is something that needs attention. In my perfect world, I always wanted to unveil a fully renovated Memorial Stadium in time for the 100th anniversary of its dedication in 2024. At this point, I don&#x27;t know how likely that is. As we transition into Phase 2, it will be a function of talking through the priorities. Sometimes those priorities are driven in part by donor interest and donor appetite. It happens often where a certain gift materializes and it moves a project from No. 3 to No. 1. That happens all the time.&quot;

The following year, Whitman disclosed that renovations were being completed incrementally, with $8 million spent over the past three years. Renovations included new flooring, repainting, and updating bathroom facilities, among other improvements. Whitman also stated that he was targeting a renovation package between $25–30 million that would upgrade the stadium&#x27;s technology, such as the sound system and Wi-Fi.

<text>Miami Arena was an indoor arena located in Miami, Florida. The venue served as the home of the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). From 1988 until 1999, it also was the indoor arena for the Miami Hurricanes.

==History==

Completed in 1988 at a cost of $52.5 million, its opening took business away from the Hollywood Sportatorium and eventually led to that venue&#x27;s demolition. The arena was the home of the Miami Heat from 1988 to 1999, the Florida Panthers from 1993 to 1998, the University of Miami basketball teams from 1988 to 2003, the Miami Hooters of the Arena Football League from 1993 to 1995, the Miami Matadors of the ECHL in 1998 and the Miami Manatees of the WHA2 in 2003. The first game played by the Heat in their first home was a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, 111–91, on November 5, 1988; the first victory came a month and a half later against the Utah Jazz, 101–80.

The arena also hosted the 1990 NBA All-Star Game, the 1991 WWF Royal Rumble, the 1994 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball East Regional final, the NHL&#x27;s 1996 Stanley Cup Finals between the Florida Panthers and Colorado Avalanche and the NBA&#x27;s 1997 NBA Playoffs Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls.

By 1998, the Miami Arena, like most indoor sports arenas built in the late 1980s, was beginning to show its age, despite being only 10 years old. Its seating capacity was one of the lowest of any NBA or NHL arena. In addition, sports teams in general began wanting newer, more updated facilities, specifically luxury suites and new concessions. In 1998, the Panthers moved into the National Car Rental Center (now Amerant Bank Arena) in Sunrise, near Florida&#x27;s largest outlet mall, Sawgrass Mills. On January 2, 2000, the Heat moved to the new American Airlines Arena located three blocks east of Miami Arena on the shore of Biscayne Bay.

After the year 2000, the arena became mostly inactive, as most of the concerts that were held at Miami Arena moved to the newer venues. However, the Miami Manatees of the WHA2 played at the Miami Arena in 2003, and the Miami Morays indoor football from 2005 to 2006.

The arena was easily accessible via mass transit, with a Metrorail stop at Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre station just across the street (once known as Overtown/Arena station). Miami-Dade city buses also service the arena area downtown. Miami Arena was sometimes called the &quot;Pink Elephant&quot;, because it was a white elephant with pink colored walls.

In 2004, the arena was sold in a public auction to Glenn Straub, an investor from Palm Beach County, for half of the price the city of Miami paid for its original construction. On August 3, 2008, Straub announced in a television interview that the interior of the arena had been cleared out and that the building would be demolished by the end of the month. On September 21, 2008, the roof of the Miami Arena was imploded. While the exterior walls remained standing after the implosion, demolition continued until the falling of the west wall on October 21, 2008. A parking lot now exists where the arena used to stand.

<doc id="768450" wikidata="Q754050" url="?curid=768450" title="Kowari">
<text>The kowari (Dasyuroides byrnei), also known by its Diyari name kariri, is a small carnivorous marsupial native to the gibber deserts of central Australia. It is the sole member of the genus &quot;Dasyuroides.&quot;

Other names for the species include brush-tailed marsupial rat, bushy-tailed marsupial rat, kawiri, Kayer rat, and Byrne&#x27;s crest-tailed marsupial rat.

== Taxonomy ==

The kowari was first described by Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer in 1896, based on a type specimen collected near Charlotte Waters in the Northern Territory. The species was named in honour of Patrick Michael Byrne, the telegraph operator at the Charlotte Waters Telegraph Station who handed the specimen to Spencer. However, it is likely that the specimen was first collected by a person from the Arrernte nation.

The kowari is a member of the family Dasyuridae, and the sole member of genus &quot;Dasyuroides.&quot; For some time it was included in the genus &quot;Dasycercus&quot; with the mulgaras, however recent genetic work has confidently separated the kowari as their sister-taxon.

It was once thought that there were two subspecies, however these were based on minor morphological differences and they are no longer recognised:
*&quot;D. b. byrnei&quot;, including the original type specimen from Charlotte Waters, Northern Territory;
*&quot;D. b. pallidior&quot;, type specimen from Killalpaninna, South Australia.

== Description ==

The kowari is most readily distinguished from its closest relatives, the mulgaras, by having a thick, bushy brush of black hairs fully encircling the end of its tail. Other distinguishing features include having four toes on each hindfoot (as opposed to five), and the fact that the base of its tail is never fattened (tail base is often fattened in the brush-tailed mulgara, and occasionally fattened in the crest-tailed mulgara).

Male kowaris are slightly larger than females, with males weighing , and females weighing . Head-body length is for males and for females, with both sexes having tails long. 

== Distribution and habitat ==

The kowari is found in stony desert areas of the Lake Eyre drainage basin, including the Sturt Stony Desert in north-eastern South Australia and south-western Queensland&#x27;s Channel Country. Its range is declining, and it is now extinct in the Northern Territory.

Kowaris inhabit open gibber plains between braided river channels and sand dunes. They prefer areas where rocks are flat, even-sized and smaller than 5 cm, and there are few shrubs. They burrow in small sand mounds, which form in depressions on the gibber plain, and hunt nocturnally between the sand mounds and on the gibber plain. During the day, they generally remain inside their burrows, but may emerge to bask at its entrance.

==Diet==

The kowari is an opportunistic and voracious hunter, with its regular diet including the long-haired rat (&quot;Rattus villosissimus&quot;), house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), geckoes, insects and other arthropods, including centipedes. Most animals of equal or smaller size to the kowari may be considered prey if the opportunity arises, including birds. Kowaris kill with strong bites to the head, although they do not always strike the optimal location.

==Reproduction==

Kowaris reach sexual maturity at 10–11 months old, and will commence breeding in their first year of life. Breeding occurs in May-December, with each female producing up to six pouch young. They have a gestation period of 35 days, after which the young are firmly attached to the teat for about 56 days. Other development milestones include eyes opening at 74 days, play-fighting beginning at 86 days and switching to solid food at around 95 days. Once weaned, the young will live independently. Wild kowari lifespans average little more than a year, although some have been known to live and breed for two years in the wild, or longer in captivity. 

==Conservation==
The kowari is listed as a Vulnerable species under both the Australian Federal EPBC Act and IUCN Red List, as well as Vulnerable in Queensland, Endangered in South Australia, and Extinct in the Northern Territory.

Much of its remaining range is currently run as pastoral land for the production of beef. In Queensland, it is protected in both the Astrebla Downs and Diamantina National Parks, although it has not been seen in Diamantina National Park since 2012. In South Australia, none of its current range falls under conservation tenement, though a predator free reserve of 12,000 hectares has been set up near Andamooka Station where 12 kowaris were transferred to from around the Birdsville Track in 2022.

===Threats===
The kowari&#x27;s primary threat is habitat degradation, particularly by livestock, but also rabbits. Other threats include being preyed upon by (and being in competition for prey with) feral cats, foxes, and dingoes, as well as climate change, possible poisoning by insecticides and baits, and the loss of habitat for road construction material.

Overstocked cattle are known to degrade the sand mounds which kowaris burrow in for shelter, and by eating the sparse vegetation associated with the mounds, they also reduce the shelter available for kowari prey. There is strong evidence that overstocking of cattle has reduced kowari abundances at some sites, and possibly led to their extirpation at others.

Kowaris now have a highly fragmented population, with a high proportion of the subpopulations likely to be un-viable in the face of current threats.

===Diseases in captivity===
Captive kowari are known to be associated with oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The SCCs cause tumours to invade the oral cavity of the kowari and begin to cause swelling in the gums. Prior to tumour formation, periodontal diseases are heavily present in the oral cavity. Captive kowaris are not expected to survive if SCCs spread into other regions of the body.

<text>Omni Coliseum (often called The Omni) was an indoor arena in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Completed in 1972, the arena seated 16,378 for basketball and 15,278 for hockey. It was part of the Omni Complex, now known as the CNN Center.

It was the home arena for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1972 until the arena&#x27;s closure in 1997, and the Atlanta Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL) from their inception in 1972 until 1980, when the franchise was sold and relocated to Calgary, Alberta. It hosted the 1977 Final Four, the 1988 Democratic National Convention, and the 1996 Summer Olympics indoor volleyball competition.

The Omni was closed and demolished in 1997. Its successor, Philips Arena (now State Farm Arena), was constructed on the Omni&#x27;s site and opened in 1999.

==Construction==
In 1968, real estate developer Tom Cousins, and former Governor of Georgia, Carl Sanders bought the NBA&#x27;s St. Louis Hawks, and relocated them to Atlanta, where Cousins made plans to build a new sports arena over an unused railroad gulch in the downtown area. The $17 million indoor arena with a total capacity of 16,500 would be named &quot;The Omni&quot;, where its name comes from the Latin prefix meaning &quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot;. Construction on the Omni began in April 1971, and was completed in October 1972.

===Structure===
The arena was considered an architectural marvel that combined innovative roof, seating, and structural designs. The logo is based on the unique seating arrangement.

The exterior cladding was composed of Cor-Ten weathering steel, which is covered in rust; the idea was that the steel would continue to rust to the point where the rusted exterior would form a protective seal, making a solid steel structure that would last for decades.

The Omni was noted for its distinctive space frame roof, often joked about as looking like an egg crate or a rusty waffle iron. Designed by the firm of tvsdesign with structural engineering work by the firm of Prybylowski and Gravino, the roof was technically described as an ortho-quad truss system.

===Scoreboard===
The only surviving component of the Omni is its scoreboard, which now hangs in the pavilion of the State Farm Arena. American Sign &amp; Indicator (which became Trans-Lux) built the basketball-specific scoreboard in the early 1980s to replace the original hockey-specific scoreboard that Daktronics maintained during the 1990s. The arena also had four message boards in each end zone, two of which were animation boards.

==Events==

===Professional wrestling===
The Omni was a hotbed for professional wrestling. Since its opening, it was considered the home base for the NWA&#x27;s Georgia Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, and World Championship Wrestling. Many major and historic wrestling events took place at the Omni, including Starrcade (1985, 1986, 1989 and 1992), the first WarGames match during the Great American Bash tour (1987), and the first Slamboree in 1993. The World Wrestling Federation also held many events at the Omni including house shows and closed circuit broadcasts until their last card at the venue on November 2, 1992. WCW also aired &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on January 1, 1996, and March 3, 1997, at the Omni.

===Boxing===
In July 1986 challenger Evander Holyfield beat WBA Light Heavyweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi by split decision (144–140, 147–138, 141–143). The fight is widely regarded as one of the best fights in the history of boxing.

===Basketball and hockey===
The Omni was home to the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks from 1972 to 1997. The Hawks played their first game at the Omni on October 15, 1972, defeating the New York Knicks, 109–101. Their final game at the Omni was a Game 4 loss to Michael Jordan, and the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals during the 1997 NBA Playoffs, 89–80 on May 11, 1997.

The Omni was also home to the NHL&#x27;s Atlanta Flames (now the Calgary Flames) from 1972 until 1980, and the Atlanta Knights of the IHL (1992–1996). In 1994, the Knights became the only pro team to win a championship in the building, when they won the Turner Cup.

In 1977, the arena hosted the NCAA Final Four, won by Marquette University over North Carolina. This was Warriors&#x27; coach Al McGuire&#x27;s last game. It also hosted one SEC and three ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournaments, the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, the 1993 NCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Final Four, and the indoor volleyball matches for the 1996 Summer Olympics.

===Indoor soccer===
The Omni was the indoor home of the Atlanta Chiefs of the North American Soccer League, as well as the Atlanta Attack of the American Indoor Soccer Association.

===Concerts===
The Omni was Atlanta&#x27;s primary concert venue from 1972 to 1997. The Grateful Dead played The Omni 24 times between 1973 and 1995, more than any other musical act.
The Jacksons performed for the Destiny World Tour in 1979 and for the Triumph Tour in 1981. Madonna brought both her Virgin Tour in 1985 and her Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour in 1987 to the Omni Coliseum. Michael Jackson performed for the Bad Tour in 1988. Elvis Presley played 12 sell out shows between June 1973 and December 1976. Judas Priest has also played this venue on a few occasions. Def Leppard recorded footage from the October 7–9, 1988 shows at the Omni for their In the Round, in Your Face video. Paul McCartney and Wings played at the Omni on May 18, 1976, and May 19, 1976, during their Wings Over the World tour. Paul McCartney returned to the Omni with his band for concerts on February 18, 1990, and February 19, 1990. George Harrison played two concerts on November 24, 1974, on his only North American solo tour. Pink Floyd played at the Omni in November 1987 on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour.

===Other events===
Among the major non-sports events at the Omni was the 1988 Democratic National Convention, where delegates nominated Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen for President and Vice President of the United States, respectively.

==Problems and replacement==
The Omni did not last nearly as long as many other arenas built during the same time period, in part because a number of its innovations did not work as intended. Most seriously, its designers failed to reckon with Atlanta&#x27;s humid subtropical climate, which specifically caused problems with the Cor-Ten exterior walls; the weathering steel never actually created the seal that had been envisioned and instead corroded to the point where holes large enough for a person to climb through began showing up along the perimeter of the building. In addition, the space frame roof of the building would often leak water as the designers did not anticipate the building settling into its foundation as quickly as it did.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing number of NBA and NHL teams began to construct arenas with better amenities for their high-end customers to increase revenue. These amenities included luxury boxes, club seating, and massive club concourses. Some of these new arenas had as many as 200 luxury boxes. By comparison, the Omni had only 16 luxury boxes and no club level. It also became a disadvantage during Atlanta&#x27;s explosive population growth.

Although the Omni hosted many events, it lost more than its share due to the smaller capacity and lack of amenities compared to newer buildings in other cities. By the start of the 1990s, an effort began to build a replacement. A new arena would have likely been needed in any event due to the Omni&#x27;s structural problems. This also stemmed from Ted Turner&#x27;s desire to own an NHL franchise; the Flames had been sold to Canadian businessmen and relocated to Calgary, Alberta a decade earlier. The NHL determined the Omni was not suitable even as a temporary facility, and would only grant Atlanta an expansion team if Turner guaranteed a brand-new arena would be in place by the time the new team took the ice.

Despite the arena&#x27;s close proximity to the CNN Center, Georgia World Congress Center, and the Omni MARTA station, the Omni was imploded on July 26, 1997. Philips Arena (now State Farm Arena) was constructed in its place, and opened on September 18, 1999. The demolition of the Omni forced the Hawks to split their home games for the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons between the Alexander Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech (their first home in Atlanta), and the Georgia Dome.
