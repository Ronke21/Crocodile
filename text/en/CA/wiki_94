<text>HMS &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was the second of two s built for the Royal Navy before the First World War. Designed in response to the s of the Imperial German Navy, the ships significantly improved on the speed, armament, and armour of the preceding . The ship was named after Louise, The Princess Royal, a title occasionally granted to the Monarch&#x27;s eldest daughter.

Completed in 1913, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the start of World War I in August 1914. She was then sent to the Caribbean Sea to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS). During the Battle of Dogger Bank, the ship scored only a few hits, although one crippled the German armoured cruiser . Shortly afterward, she became the flagship of the 1st BCS, under the command of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock.

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. She was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==

The &quot;Lion&quot;-class battlecruisers, nicknamed the &quot;Splendid Cats&quot;, were designed by Philip Watts, the Director of Naval Construction, to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the &quot;Moltke&quot; class as the German ships were to the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 70% increase in size over the preceding battlecruisers. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship normally displaced and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. She had a metacentric height of at deep load.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Lion&quot;-class ships had two paired sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine-rooms, each set driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 42 Yarrow large-tube boilers. Designed power was for a speed of . In September 1912, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; began her sea trials and developed for a speed of . During maximum power trials in July 1913, the battlecruiser achieved for a speed of while at the unusually high displacement of . Maximum was of coal and an additional of fuel oil to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At , the ship&#x27;s range was .

===Armament===
&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was armed with eight BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns (&quot;BL&quot; for breech-loading) in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; from bow to stern. Her secondary armament consisted of 16 BL 4-inch Mk VII guns, most of which were mounted in casemates in the superstructure. The two guns mounted on the deck above the forward group of casemates were fitted with gun shields in 1913 and 1914 to better protect their crews from enemy fire.

The battlecruiser was built without anti-aircraft (AA) guns, but from October 1914 to December 1916 she was fitted with a single QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun (&quot;QF&quot; for quick-firing) on a high-angle mount. A single QF 3-inch 20 cwt AA gun was added in January 1915 and carried until April 1917.

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; received a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their guns on the target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier for the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship&#x27;s roll as the turrets fired individually.

By early 1918, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off ramps fitted on top of &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

===Armour===
The armour protection given to &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was heavier than on the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s. The waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships; this thinned to 4 inches towards the ships&#x27; ends, and did not reach the bow or stern. The upper armour strake had a maximum thickness of 6 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast of the end turrets. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used . The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from . Nickel-steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast of the magazines and shell rooms. The sides of the conning tower were thick. After the Battle of Jutland revealed a vulnerability to plunging shellfire, 1 inch of additional armour, weighing approximately , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was laid down at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 2 May 1910. She was launched on 29 April 1911 by Louise, Princess Royal, and commissioned on 14 November 1912. She cost £1,955,922 plus an additional £120,300 for her armament. Upon commissioning, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which was renamed the 1st BCS in January 1913. Rear-Admiral David Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. The squadron, including &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, visited Brest in February 1914 and ports in the Russian Empire during June.

===Battle of Heligoland Bight===
&quot;Princess Royal&quot; first saw combat during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. She was part of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruiser force, which was originally to provide distant support to the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast if the German High Seas Fleet sortied in response. The battlecruisers headed south at full speed at 11:35, when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule, as the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. The British light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers appeared out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; was quickly crippled by the squadron&#x27;s guns. Before &quot;Cöln&quot; could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the German light cruiser directly to his front, and ordered pursuit. &quot;Ariadne&quot; was reduced to a burning hulk after only three salvos at less than .

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; sailed from Cromarty on 28 September to rendezvous with a Canadian troop convoy bound for the United Kingdom. She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October, but was detached again a few days later to reinforce the North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons in the search for Admiral Graf Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November during the Battle of Coronel. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; arrived at Halifax on 21 November, then spent several days off New York City before she steamed down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility that Graf Spee would use the Panama Canal. The East Asia Squadron was sunk off the Falkland Islands on 7 December, and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; left Kingston, Jamaica, en route to the UK on 19 December.

===Battle of Dogger Bank===

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British vessels that might be collecting intelligence on German movements. The British were reading the German coded messages, and a large battlecruiser force under Beatty sailed to intercept. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th, when the British light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35, the Germans had seen Beatty&#x27;s force; Hipper – aboard – ordered his ships south at , thinking he could outpace any British battleships, and could increase to &quot;Blücher&quot;″s maximum speed of if the pursuing ships were battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships – &quot;Lion&quot;, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and – pursued at , and &quot;Lion&quot; opened fire at 08:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later, but the extreme range and decreasing visibility meant they did not start scoring hits until 09:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire two minutes later at a range of and concentrated their fire on &quot;Lion&quot;, hitting her once. At 09:35, Beatty signalled to &quot;engage the corresponding ships in the enemy&#x27;s line&quot;, but &quot;Tiger&quot;″s captain – believing that was already engaging &quot;Blücher&quot; – joined &quot;Lion&quot; in attacking &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, which left unengaged and able to fire on &quot;Lion&quot; without risk. &quot;Moltke&quot; and combined their fire to badly damage &quot;Lion&quot; over the next hour, even with &quot;Princess Royal&quot; attacking &quot;Derfflinger&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;Blücher&quot; had been heavily damaged; her speed had dropped to , and her steering gear was jammed. Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot; to attack her at 10:48. Six minutes later, he spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although the submarine warning flag was not raised because most of &quot;Lion&quot;″s signal halyards had been shot away. Soon afterward, &quot;Lion&quot; lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water, which knocked out all remaining light and power. At 11:02, Beatty had flags hoisted signalling &quot;course north-east&quot;, to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper, and &quot;attack the rear of the enemy&quot;. Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore – temporarily commanding the squadron from – thought the signals meant to attack &quot;Blücher&quot;, which was about to the north-east, and ordered the four other battlecruisers away from the pursuit of Hipper&#x27;s main force to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read in the smoke and haze.

Beatty transferred to the destroyer at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers, reaching them shortly before &quot;Blücher&quot; sank. He boarded &quot;Princess Royal&quot; at 12:20 and ordered the ships to pursue the main German force. This order was rescinded when it became clear that the time lost in sinking &quot;Blücher&quot; meant the rest of Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers would reach friendly waters before they could be caught. Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers turned for home, catching up to &quot;Lion&quot;, which was limping along at .

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; hit &quot;Derfflinger&quot; once, but only damaged two armour plates and caused a coal bunker to flood. She hit &quot;Blücher&quot; at least twice, including the shot that crippled her, out of a total of 271 shells fired during the battle, a hit rate of only 0.7%. By way of contrast, her sister made four hits out of 243 shells fired, a rate of 1.6%. She also fired two 13.5-inch shrapnel shells at the German airship L 5 as its crew attempted to bomb the sinking &quot;Blücher&quot;, mistaking it for a British ship, despite the fact that the maximum elevation of those guns was only 20°. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was not damaged during the battle.

===Battle of Jutland===

On 31 May 1916, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was flagship of the 1st BCS under Beatty&#x27;s overall command; they had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not see the Germans to their east for another 10 minutes. At 15:32, Beatty ordered a course change to east south-east, positioning the British ships to cut off the Germans&#x27; line of retreat, and signalled action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.

This began what was to be called the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course less than away. The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships – &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; – had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The two battlecruisers engaged , the leading German ship, while &quot;Derfflinger&quot; targeted &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. The German fire was accurate from the start, with two hits on &quot;Princess Royal&quot; within the first three minutes. British gunnery was less effective; the range was incorrectly estimated as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Princess Royal&quot;″s &#x27;A&#x27; turret stopped working effectively early in the battle: the left gun was rendered inoperable when the breech pinion gear sheared, and the right gun misfired frequently. By 15:54, the range was down to ; Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range three minutes later.

At 16:11, a torpedo fired by &quot;Moltke&quot; passed under &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo&#x27;s track, but incorrectly concluded that a U-boat was positioned on the opposite side of the British line – away from the German battlecruisers – and was firing toward both groups of ships. This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer . By this time, the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 16:12 and 16:15, closing the range. This manoeuvre exposed &quot;Lion&quot; to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused &quot;Derfflinger&quot; to lose sight of &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and switch targets to at 16:16. By 16:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded. At 16:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, they sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not report this to the fleet for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit, but Beatty&#x27;s ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet, and at 17:40 opened fire again on their German counterparts. Facing the setting sun, the Germans could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 17:47. Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division to manoeuvre away from the Germans. About 18:22, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was hit by two shells fired by the battleship ; one of these disabled &#x27;X&#x27; turret and the other penetrated the ship&#x27;s side armour. By 18:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 18:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper&#x27;s force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of &quot;New Zealand&quot;, while slowing to and altering course to the south. Beatty then ordered his ships to make a complete circle to stay within visual range of the Grand Fleet. At 18:55, Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 19:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the danger precipitated by his previous turn. About this time, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; fired at the leading German battlecruiser for three minutes without result.

The British lost sight of the Germans until the light cruiser spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 20:05, then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. Hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers. Shortly after 20:30, the pre-dreadnought battleships of Konteradmiral (Rear-Admiral) Franz Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans fired only a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, disappearing into the mist around 20:40. Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 02:55.

Along with the rest of the battlecruisers, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; reached Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on the morning of 2 June, and she immediately received temporary repairs over the next eight days. She then sailed for Plymouth, where permanent repairs were completed on 15 July, and returned to Rosyth by 21 July. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was hit nine times during the battle – six times by &quot;Derfflinger&quot; during the &quot;Run to the South&quot;, twice by &quot;Markgraf&quot; during the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, and once by just after II Battle Squadron appeared – with 22 killed and 81 injured. The battlecruiser fired only 230 main-gun shells during the battle, as her visibility was often impaired by the funnel smoke and fires aboard &quot;Lion&quot;. She was credited with three hits on &quot;Lützow&quot; and two on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;.

===Post-Jutland career===
The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea but miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or that it could be forced into an engagement at a disadvantage.

&quot;Princess Royal&quot; provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German ships. She sailed with the 1st BCS on 12 December after German destroyers sank seven ships of a Norway-bound convoy, including the escorting destroyer , four naval trawlers and four cargo ships earlier that day, but the British were unable to intercept and returned to base the following day. &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. Starting in July, the Grand Fleet was affected by the 1918 flu pandemic; at one point, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; lacked sufficient healthy crewmen to sail.

Following the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at the end of the war, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force at Scapa Flow. &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919. The battlecruiser was placed in reserve the following year, and an attempt to sell her to Chile later in 1920 was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922 and was sold on 22 January 1923 to J&amp;W Purves for £25,000. Her contract was immediately transferred to the Rosyth Shipbreaking Co. which had leased facilities at Rosyth Dockyard for that purpose, and her demolition was completed during 1925.

<text>Orchiopexy (or orchidopexy) is a surgery to move and/or permanently fix a testicle into the scrotum. While orchiopexy typically describes the operation to surgically correct an undescended testicle, it is also used to resolve testicular torsion.

==Indications==
=== Undescended testicle ===
Undescended testicles affect 1% of males and are 10% bilateral. The cause is unknown, with a small percentage associated with developmental abnormalities or chromosomal aberrations.

Early orchiopexy reduces the risks for cancer and sterility in males with cryptorchidism, or undescended testes.

Cryptorchidism is definitively diagnosed after 1 year of age, as testicular descent may occur after birth. Surgical placement into the scrotum is recommended by 18 months to decrease the likelihood of testicular cancer, testicular atrophy, and sterility.

Cryptorchidism is associated with tubular atrophy and sterility. In addition, cryptorchid testes carry a three to five times higher risk for testicular cancer (germ cell neoplasia in situ within the atrophic tubules). Patients are at increased risk for the development of cancer and atrophy in the contralateral, normally descended testes as well.

There are multiple different orchiopexy techniques used to correct an undescended testicle due to the large variation in location where the testes may present. The procedures have a high overall success rate.

=== Testicular torsion ===

Orchiopexy is performed in the event of testicular torsion, a urologic emergency presenting with intense pain and often without inciting injury.

While neonatal torsion occurs with no anatomic defect to account for its occurrence (occurring in utero or shortly after birth), adult torsion results from a bilateral congenital anomaly often called a &quot;bell-clapper deformity&quot;, where the testis is abnormally anchored in the scrotal sac, leading to increased mobility.

Twisting of the spermatic cord results in obstruction of the testicular venous drainage. Intense vascular engorgement and infarction may lead to testicular injury and sterility. If the cord is manually untwisted within approximately six hours the testis has a high chance of remaining viable. One in three cases results in dead testes, requiring orchiectomy.

Surgical fixation in the form of orchiopexy is indicated to prevent the reoccurrence of torsion, and is usually performed bilaterally, even if only one testicle is affected by torsion. The procedure has a high success rate in preventing reoccurrence.

==Surgical techniques==
=== For fixation of the undescended testes ===
For the management of palpable undescended testes (over 80% of undescended testes) the standard inguinal approach is the appropriate procedure.

Approximately 50% of non-palpable testis are high in the inguinal canal or abdominal, while the other 50% are atrophic, and usually located in the scrotum. Diagnostic laparoscopy is often advised to determine the location of non-palpable testis.
* Prescrotal orchiopexy is often used for low inguinal testes, reducing surgical time and patient discomfort as compared to other methods, while also reducing the risk of complications. Additionally, hernias and hydroceles can be successfully repaired during this procedure. This approach maintains the high success rate seen in other surgical methods.
* Standard open inguinal orchiopexy is most appropriate procedure for palpable testes. With this technique, the spermatic cord and testicular vessels can be easily visualized and a patent processus vaginalis can be easily corrected. This approach requires a second incision to secure the testicle within the scrotum (as compared to the prescrotal approach).
* Laparoscopic orchiopexy is best used for abdominal testis, while mobile/peeping testis distal to the inguinal ring should be approached with the standard one-stage laparoscopic or open orchiopexy. The major proposed benefits of laparoscopic orchiopexy are the possibility of high retroperitoneal dissection and/or rerouting the testes through a shorter pathway medial to the inferior epigastric vessels (called the “Prentiss maneuver”) for a more favorable scrotal position. The benefits of both techniques is debated, with neither showing a difference in success rates. For palpable undescended testes, multi-study analysis has shown that there is no significant difference in safety or success rates between standard open inguinal and laparoscopic approaches, with the latter being more expensive and associated with a higher rate of complications (extensive high retroperitoneal dissection with scrotal hematomas and wound infection, Prentiss maneuvers with hemorrhage from epigastric vessels and wound infection).
* Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy is a two-stage procedure applied for high intra-abdominal testes (often with short vascular pedicle) or non-mobile testis. This method makes use of collateral blood supply to maintain testicular blood flow, allowed the testis to be brought down further to reach the scrotum without tension. Stage 1 involved vessel ligation (spermatic arteries, as well as inferior epigastric, cremasteric, and vas deferens arteries), with a period of 6 months to allow for collateral blood supply to develop. Stage 2 involved testicular mobilization and fixation within the dartos pouch, which is often performed with laparoscopy. The two-staged Fowler-Stephens is now performed as routine management for intra-abdominal testes at many institutions.
* Microvascular autotransplantation is another option for patients with intra-abdominal testes, particularly in those with bilateral undescended testes. This technique uses microvascular anastomosis to maximize testicular blood supply after mobilization of the testicles (to get around the high variability in blood supply can complicate the Fowler-Stephens procedure). It takes a lot of microvascular surgical skill, specialized instrumentation, and is a much longer procedure.

=== For fixation of testicular torsion ===
Two distinct techniques used for surgical fixation are the sutured point-fixation and Jaboulay tunica plication. Multiple studies have shown that both are effective techniques for fixation with limited evidence favoring either in acute torsion.

Sutured fixation may be performed using either absorbable or non-absorbable sutures, with 3 point fixation sites being preferred. There are concerns regarding potential complications arising from suture fixation (and required breach of the tunica albuginea) like infarction and abscess formation, however this is not supported by data.

The Jaboulay procedure was developed later as a non-suture fixation method that avoids trans-parenchymal sutures and instead utilizes eversion, loose plication, and adhesion formation. this technique is criticized for potential security inadequacy.

Overall, there is considerable variation in surgical practice for testicular fixation for testicular torsion, with no significant difference in effectiveness between sutured and Jaboulay fixation in emergency re-presentations, post-operative complications, or returns to operation.

==History==
The first attempts at surgical correction of cryptorchidism began in the early 1800s. Before this, inguinal testis were managed with the use of truss or castration, if at all.

The theory of orchiopexy is attributed to the observations of Baron Albrecht von Haller and John Hunter in the 1700s, who began to elucidate the anatomy and mechanism of testicular descent.

The first recorded attempt for surgical correction of an undescended testis was performed by James Adams in the London Hospital in 1871, although there are reports of attempts by several German doctors (J. F. Rosenmerkel in 1820 and M.J. von Chelius in 1837). The patient died due to infectious complications of the procedure.

Thomas Annandale completed the first successful orchiopexy in 1887 on a three-year-old boy. He discussed the care of this patient in &quot;The British Medical Journal,&quot; crediting Thomas Curling (who had worked with James Adams) with the idea of anchoring the testis to the bottom of the scrotum. Notably, Annandale was a close acquaintance of Joseph Lister, and practiced antiseptic techniques that had been absent from previous attempts by other physicians. The postoperative course was reported to be “satisfactory in every way”.

Max Schüller, Arthur Dean Bevan, and John K. Lattimer further contributed to the current techniques for orchiopexy between the late 1800s and early 1900s, with the steps for standard orchiopexy being established before the 1960s. At this point, the standard orchiopexy applied to most undescended testes had a high success rate ranging from 89% to 92%- Attention was then turned to the treatment of high undescended testes, which the standard orchiopexy did not adequately treat.

In 1979, Jones and Bagley suggested a high inguinal incision for high canalicular or intra-abdominal testes. Fowler and Stephens devised a means to preserve the blood supply of high undescended testes through collateral circulation. Their technique was modified into a two-staged operation. Later, one-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy was reported first to reveal the location of non-palpable testes and then as a therapeutic treatment.

<text>Battle Chess is a video game version of chess with 2.5D graphics and fighting animations showing the result of one piece moving onto the square of another. It was developed and released by Interplay Entertainment for the Amiga in 1988 and ported to many other systems, including the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Acorn Archimedes, Amiga CD32, Amiga CDTV, Apple IIGS, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, FM Towns, Nintendo Entertainment System, MacOS, PC-98, X68000, and Microsoft Windows. In 1991, Battle Chess Enhanced was released by Interplay for IBM PC compatibles and Macintosh with improved VGA graphics and a symphonic musical score played from the CD-ROM.

&quot;Battle Chess&quot; was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, resulting in two official follow-ups as well as several inspired games. A remake, &quot;Battle Chess: Game of Kings&quot;, was released on Steam on December 11, 2015.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Battle Chess&quot; follows the same rules as traditional chess, with pieces moving in an animated fashion and battles playing out so that the capturing piece defeats its target. Furthermore, when checkmate is delivered, the checkmating piece fights and defeats the king. Since there are six types of pieces for each color, and a king cannot check (let alone capture) another king, there are a total of 35 different battle animations. The rook, for example, turns into a rock monster and kills a pawn by smashing its head, and the rook kills the queen by eating her. There are some pop-culture homages; the knight versus knight animation references the black knight fight in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, and the king versus bishop fight pastiches the short battle between Indiana Jones and a swordsman in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

The game can be also played in a 2D version with no animations, and the Amiga CDTV version has a fully voiced introduction describing the movements of the pieces for the benefit of beginners. Digitized sound is used in the MS-DOS version for all battle sound effects and is played through the PC speaker, without the need for a sound card, using a technique akin to RealSound.

&quot;Battle Chess&quot; can be played against a human opponent (by hotseat, null modem or over a local area network in some ports) or against the computer&#x27;s artificial intelligence (AI). The game has an opening library of over 30,000 moves (which were not available for the Commodore 64 and Apple II versions). 

== Development ==
&quot;Battle Chess&quot; was the first title developed and published by Interplay Entertainment themselves after ending their relationship with Electronic Arts, besides &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.

&quot;Battle Chess&quot; producer and Interplay&#x27;s founder Brian Fargo expressed his fondness for the game in a 2006 interview, although he added that he did not think there would be much of an audience for it today.

An apocryphal story of the development was the invention of &quot;The Duck&quot; (an example of Parkinson&#x27;s law of triviality): The producers of the game were known to demand changes to the game, presumably to make their mark on the finished product. To this end, one animator added a small duck around the queen piece, but made sure that the sprite would be easily removable. Come review, the producers, predictably, okayed everything but asked for the duck to be removed. This became known as &quot;Atwood&#x27;s duck&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Battle Chess&quot; sold 250,000 copies by February 1993.

Ken St. Andre reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;Quibbles aside, every chess player will want a copy of this program, and every Amiga owner owes it to him/herself to see Battlechess in action. Highly recommended.&quot;

The Amiga version received favourable reviews from magazines due to its comical battle sequences which were advanced (for the time) in terms of graphics, animation and sound. German game magazine &quot;ASM&quot;, however, criticized the weak chess AI. In a review of the 3DO version, Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated, &quot;If you are a chess fan, then you may want to check this title out.&quot;

In 1994 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said of the remake, &quot;Battle Chess Enhanced&quot;, that &quot;Better artwork, smoother animations, and a much stronger chess algorithm than its disk predecessors make the CD version a good buy&quot;.

Interplay won &quot;Best Graphics Achievement In A Non-Graphics Product&quot; from Software Publishers Association (later renamed to Software and Information Industry Association) for &quot;Battle Chess&quot;. In 1994 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; added it to the magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame honoring those games rated highly over time by readers, describing &quot;Battle Chess&quot; as &quot;a showcase product for the first level of multimedia standards&quot;. In 1996 the magazine ranked it as the 106th-best game of all time for its &quot;funny, elaborate animated sequences and spectacular special effects.&quot;

== Legacy ==
International Master Anna Rudolf credits &quot;Battle Chess&quot; with helping introduce her to chess at a young age.

The game was featured in the 1992 film &quot;Knight Moves&quot; about a chess grandmaster who is accused of several murders.

===Sequels===
A sequel titled &quot;Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess&quot; was released in 1990, based on xiangqi, commonly known as &quot;Chinese chess&quot;. 1992&#x27;s &quot;Battle Chess 4000&quot; spoofed science fiction movies and television series (such as a battle sequence involving the monolith from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;) and used a clay-animation art style similar to &quot;ClayFighter&quot;.

On December 28, 2015, Brian Fargo revealed that he had started working on a second sequel of the game titled &quot;Battle Chess 3&quot; in the late 1990s but the game was cancelled. He also released a footage of the prototype of the game.

===Inspired games===
&quot;Battle Chess&quot; also inspired a number of video game clones, such as &quot;Star Wars Chess&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day – Chess Wars&quot;, &quot;Combat Chess&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Chess Maniac 5 Billion and 1&quot;. Another clone, &quot;War Chess&quot; was released by XS Games for the PlayStation 2 in 2005, and was later ported to the PC by Big Fish Games and released online.

One similar game, titled &quot;Battle vs. Chess&quot;, was developed by TopWare Interactive for &quot;just about every platform&quot;. However, Interplay filed and won an injunction for trademark infringement in 2010 and TopWare was prevented from releasing &quot;Battle vs. Chess&quot; in the United States.
The District Court of California came into session and given that after two years of litigation, TopWare Interactive discharged their lawyer, resulting in Interplay winning the case by default. Topware afterwards released the game in North America with the name &quot;Check vs. Mate&quot;.

===Remake===
In 2012 Subdued Software launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund an updated version of &quot;Battle Chess&quot;. Although the campaign was unsuccessful, the game was ultimately published by Interplay under the name &quot;Battle Chess: Game of Kings&quot; and released on Steam in 2015. On whatoplay.com it has a rating of 4.9/10.

<text>Harold Campbell Adamson (December 10, 1906 – August 17, 1980) was an American lyricist during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early life==
Adamson, the son of building contractor Harold Adamson and Marion &quot;Minnie&quot; Campbell Adamson, was born and raised in Greenville, New Jersey, United States.

Adamson suffered from polio as a child which limited the use of his right hand. Initially, Adamson was interested in acting, but he began writing songs and poetry as a teenager.

He went on to studying acting at the University of Kansas and Harvard.

==Career==
Ultimately he entered into a songwriting contract with MGM in 1933. During his stint with MGM, he was nominated for five Academy Awards. Among his best-known compositions was the theme for the hit sitcom, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

He retired from songwriting in the early 1960s, and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972.

In 1941, he collaborated with Pierce Norman, and baseball&#x27;s Joe DiMaggio to write &quot;In the Beauty of Tahoe&quot;, published by Larry Spier, Inc. He was the lyricist for the Broadway musicals &quot;Smiles&quot; (1930), &quot;The Earl Carroll Vanities of 1931&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; (1931), &quot;Banjo Eyes&quot; (1941), and &quot;As the Girls Go&quot; (1948).

<text>Älvsjö () is a district of the city of Stockholm Municipality in Sweden, located in the borough Älvsjö in Söderort. It has the biggest rentable facility in northern Europe called Stockholm International Fairs, and also the hotel Scandic Talk Hotel, which both are located east of Älvsjö commuter train station. In 2017, the total population of the district was 1,530 inhabitants.

The name was written &quot;Elffuesio&quot; in 1461. The origin of the first element is unclear – it is possibly derived from an Old Swedish male name *&quot;Ælve&quot;, but that interpretation is uncertain. The last element &quot;sjö&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27; refers to Brännkyrkasjön, a former lake east of Älvsjö.

<text>Lyman Judson Gage (June 28, 1836 – January 26, 1927) was an American financier who served as the 42nd United States Secretary of the Treasury in the cabinets of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in DeRuyter, New York, educated at an academy in Rome, New York, and at the age of 17 became a bank clerk. In 1853 he moved to Chicago, served for three years as bookkeeper, and in 1858 entered the Merchants Loan and Trust Company, where he was cashier in 1861–1868. Afterwards he became successively assistant cashier, vice-president, and president of the First National Bank of Chicago, one of the strongest financial institutions in the Midwestern United States.

He was chosen in 1890 to be president of the board of directors of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Following the exposition, he became president of the newly formed Chicago Civic Federation, which sought to reform city governance.

===Political career===
In politics he was originally a Republican, and was a delegate to the national convention of the party in 1880, and chairman of its finance committee.

In 1884, however, he supported Grover Cleveland for the presidency, and came to be looked upon as a Democrat. In 1892 President Cleveland, after his second election, offered Gage the post of secretary of the treasury, but Gage declined the offer. In the free-silver campaign of 1896, Gage labored effectively for the election of Republican candidate William McKinley, and from March 1897 until January 1902 he served as Secretary of the Treasury in the cabinets successively of Presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

As Secretary of the Treasury, Gage was influential in securing passage of the Gold Standard Act of March 14, 1900, which reestablished a currency backed solely by gold. Since this limited the amount of currency in circulation, it initiated a period, continuing until 1912, in which the Secretary of the Treasury was obliged to interact in the money market by introducing into circulation the Treasury surplus. The inability of the Treasury to respond to the needs of the market as well as the perceived need for a currency which would expand and contract with the needs of the nation, led to the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 to regulate the money market.

Gage resigned in 1902 to become a banker in New York. From April 1902 until 1906 he was president of the United States Trust Company in New York City. His administration of the treasury department, through a more than ordinarily trying period, was marked by a conservative policy, looking toward the strengthening of the gold standard, the securing of greater flexibility in the currency, and a more perfect adjustment of the relations between the government and the National banks.

Lyman J. Gage was instrumental in creating the San Diego Panama–California Exposition of 1915. Later he was president of the committee to preserve the Expo&#x27;s characteristic buildings in Balboa Park.

===Final years===
Gage was one of the 30 founding members of the Simplified Spelling Board, founded in 1906 by Andrew Carnegie to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the orthography of the English language.

He died of pneumonia in San Diego, California in 1927, and is buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

==Private life==

Lyman Gage married Sarah Etheridge in 1864, and the couple had four children: Locke, Eli Alexander, Fanny, and Mary; only Eli survived to adulthood. Sarah died in 1874, when son Eli was 7 years old. Eli Gage married Sophie R Weare in 1893 in Iowa, but committed suicide in Seattle in 1906 leaving his wife and two young sons, Lyman J. Gage II (1896-1954) and John Weare Gage (1900-1962). After Sarah&#x27;s death, Lyman Gage married Cornelia Lansing, who died childless in 1901. In the late 1910s, Gage remarried a third time with Frances Ballou, and the two had a son, Lyman Judson. Frances died in 1943, around 16 years after Gage&#x27;s death.

In 1906, Gage indulged his longtime interest in metaphysical phenomena by purchasing property on and subsequently living at Lomaland, a Theosophist retreat in Southern California. Though this came as something of a shock to the American public, those who knew him privately were not surprised, as Gage had previously studied spiritualism, astrology, and prophesied the death of his own brother through a &quot;psychic flash&quot;. His move to Lomaland came around the same time as his sisters death in 1908, who was raising her three grandchildren including Sibyl Anikeef. Gage raised these three children after 1910.

<text>Dean Esposito (born July 20, 1963), better known as Dino, is an American DJ, singer-songwriter, and record producer.

==Early life==
Dean Esposito was born to Frank and Francis Esposito in the Encino district of Los Angeles, California. The family later moved to Hawaii and Connecticut before settling in Las Vegas, Nevada, where his father became a restaurant owner. It was here that Dino pursued his musical interests. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications/broadcasting and music at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Shortly after, he accepted a job as a program director/radio DJ at his college radio station, with his own morning show called &quot;Urban Sunrise&quot;. Soon, he moved on to become a Top-40 DJ at Nevada radio station Power 97. Subsequently, he was offered a job at KCEP, Las Vegas&#x27; largest black music station, where he eventually became program director. During this time he also moonlighted as a local club DJ.

==Music career==
Dino then became a singer, first as part of the group Esquire, and later as a solo artist. His first single &quot;Summergirls&quot; was recorded and released in 1987 on the independent label L.D. Records. He then signed with 4th &amp; B&#x27;way/Island/PolyGram Records, and in 1988 they re-released his debut single. In 1989, his debut album &quot;24/7&quot; was released, from which the singles &quot;24/7,&quot; &quot;I Like It&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;Never 2 Much of U&quot; were released. &quot;In the City&quot; was also released, but only as a 12-inch single for dance-club play.

During this initial up-swing of his career, Dino performed at theme parks, sharing the bill with such artists as Sweet Sensation and Linear. Dino developed an even wider fanbase when he became the opening act for New Kids on the Block in the summer of 1989.

His touring band was made up of powerhouse musicians. Jeff Lams (Piano), Keith Nelson (Bass), Gary Olds
(Drums), Paul Taylor (Saxophone) and Bryan Bywaters (Keyboards). Two dancers were 
added, Rob Hathcock and Kevin Robinson. This original lineup was his only touring band. Dino and his band made the late-night talk-show circuit, although some appearances were with alternate musicians such as Paul Pesco (guitar), Basil Fung (guitar), Rich Young (drums), and Melvin Davis (bass). TV performances included &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; (with Paul Pesco on guitar and Rich Young on drums), &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; (with Basil Fung on guitar, Melvin Davis on bass, and Rich Young on drums), and many others.

1990 saw the release of his sophomore LP, titled &quot;Swingin&#x27;&quot;, from which the singles &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Gentle&quot; were released. During this time, he formed his own production company and record label, ONID Productions (his name spelled backward).

He released his third album &quot;The Way I Am&quot; in 1993 on the EastWest Records label, on which he scored his last Top-40 hit, a cover of Five Stairsteps&#x27; &quot;O-o-h Child&quot;. A final single was also released, the non-charting ballad &quot;Endlessly&quot;.

After his singing career faded, he began producing and writing songs with such artists as Tonya Mitchell, Paul Taylor, Jordan Knight, Walter Beasley, Sheena Easton, and Joanna Pacitti, the latter of whose collaborative song &quot;Watch Me Shine&quot; was included on the &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; motion picture soundtrack.

<doc id="790369" wikidata="Q7119723" url="?curid=790369" title="PMC-Sierra">
<text>PMC-Sierra was a global fabless semiconductor company with offices worldwide that developed and sold semiconductor devices into the storage, communications, optical networking, printing, and embedded computing marketplaces.

On January 15, 2016, Microsemi Corporation completed the acquisition of PMC-Sierra through Microsemi&#x27;s subsidiary Lois Acquisition.

== History ==
Sierra Semiconductor was founded in 1984 in San Jose, California by James Diller. It received funding on January 11, 1984 from Sequoia Capital, and went public in 1991.

Pacific Microelectronics Centre (PMC) in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, was spun off from Microtel Pacific Research (the research arm of BC TEL at the time) to develop Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and later SONET integrated circuits (chips). With investment from Sierra Semiconductor, PMC was established in 1992 as a private company focused on providing networking semiconductors, and became a wholly owned, independently operated subsidiary of Sierra Semiconductor in 1994. Microtel is part of Verizon Communications.

In 1995, using ideas from UBC Electrical Engineering students, PMC revolutionized the optical networking chipset market with the first OC-12 (622 Mbit/s) S/UNI transceiver chips. This circuit-design breakthrough put the company 3 years ahead of Bell Labs in its optical transceiver development.

In August 1996, Sierra Semiconductor announced its decision to exit the personal computer modem chipset business, to restructure its other non-networking products and focus on its networking products. 150 employees were made redundant. In late 1996, it acquired Bipolar Integrated Technology in Beaverton, Oregon, for about $10 million to enter the Ethernet business. The headquarters was moved to Burnaby, and in June 1997, PMC Sierra overtook its parent, Sierra Semiconductor, changing its name to &quot;PMC-Sierra&quot;. It acquired Integrated Telecom Technology Inc., San Jose, for $55 million in cash and stock in 1998.

Between 2001 and 2015 the company had multiple rounds of layoffs. In 2001, 350 employees, or 24% of the total workforce, were laid off. Then in January 2003, 176 employees were laid off and in June 2005, 89 employees were laid off. In August 2006, 30 to 40 employees were laid off. In 2007 two rounds of layoffs happened, first in March 2007, 175 employees were laid off and then in December 2007, 18 employees were laid off. In July 2015, roughly 200 employees were laid off as part of a restructuring measure.

In May 2006, PMC-Sierra acquired Passave, Inc., a developer of system-on-chip semiconductors for the fiber to the home access market in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $300 million. Passave was headquartered in Boston and had a development center in Tel Aviv, Israel. On October 22, 2010, PMC-Sierra acquired Wintegra Inc. for $240 million. Wintegra had 165 employees with the majority of its development team located in Raanana, Israel, and Austin, Texas. A further acquisition was made on the 29th of May 2013 when PMC acquired IDT&#x27;s Enterprise Flash Controller Business.

During the fall of 2015, both Skyworks Solutions and Microsemi were attempting to acquire PMC-Sierra. On November 24, 2015, Microsemi announced that they had entered into an agreement to acquire PMC-Sierra.

== Technology ==
PMC-Sierra provided broadband communications and storage semiconductors for metro, access, fiber to the home, wireless infrastructure, enterprise and channel storage, laser printers and customer premises equipment. PMC had more than 250 different semiconductor devices that were sold to equipment manufacturers, who in turn supplied their equipment to communications network service providers and enterprises. As a fabless semiconductor company, PMC-Sierra designed and tested products, with wafer fabrication and assembly outsourced functions to third party suppliers.

PMC-Sierra&#x27;s customers included HP, EMC Corporation, Huawei, Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, ZTE and Juniper.

===Storage===
PMC-Sierra offered products for storage networks and systems. The company provided an interconnect and controller product family for SAS and SATA storage systems and server computer RAID controllers. PMC-Sierra provided Fibre Channel controller and system interconnect products. PMC-Sierra acquired the channel storage business from Adaptec. This business was named &quot;Adaptec by PMC&quot; and made SAS/SATA RAID Adapters. In July 2013 PMC completed the acquisition of IDT&#x27;s Flash controller business and in August 2014 introduced the Flashtec line of non-volatile memory drives.

===Communications===
PMC-Sierra offered communication ICs for metro access, metro transport, FTTH/PON, Ethernet over SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network (OTN) and wireless base transceiver stations (BTS). PMC-Sierra sold products for what is known as Ethernet in the first mile, which generally uses a passive optical network to residential areas. PMC-Sierra semiconductor devices allowed wireless service providers to deploy wireless mobile phone network equipment. This included MIPS-based network processors for wireless back haul and radio frequency integrated circuits for wideband radio modules. The company&#x27;s UniTRX chipsets were highly integrated, low-power RFICs for wideband radio modules that operated in the 400 MHz to 4 GHz frequency range. These solutions addressed the performance requirements of 3GPP and 3GPP2 macro base station radio transceivers with support of multiple standards such as MC-GSM, cdma2000®, WCDMA, and LTE.

The company&#x27;s DIGI-G4 chipset was PMC&#x27;s latest OTN processor, and it enabled the transition to 400G line cards in OTN switched metro networks. It is the industry&#x27;s densest single-chip 4x100G OTN processor with 50 percent less power per port. In March 2015 the PMC DIGI-G4 OTN processor was awarded a Lightwave Innovation Award with the judges citing &quot;...substantial new features, technologies, and capabilities included in the upgrade...&quot;

===Printers===
PMC-Sierra has discrete and system-on-chip products for both laser and multi-function printers.

<doc id="790372" wikidata="Q349556" url="?curid=790372" title="Bohemond VII of Antioch">
<text>Bohemond VII (1261 – October 19, 1287) was the count of Tripoli and nominal prince of Antioch from 1275 to his death. The only part left of the Principality of Antioch was the port of Latakia. He spent much of his reign at war with the Templars (1277–1282).

Bohemond VII was the son of Bohemond VI of Antioch and his wife Sibylla of Armenia. As Bohemond VII was still underage at his succession, Sibylla acted as regent, although the regency was also unsuccessfully claimed by King Hugh III of Cyprus, the closest adult in the line of succession. Sibylla appointed Bishop Bartholomew of Tortosa to act as bailli. Bohemond spent his minority under the protection of his uncle King Leo III of Armenia at his court in Cilicia. He returned to Tripoli in 1277 and immediately made peace with Qalawun, the Mamluk sultan, and recognised Roger of San Severino as regent at Acre for Charles I of Anjou. He exempted the Venetians from harbour duties, thus distancing the Genoese and their allies.

Upon his return, he made enemies with the powerful Embriaco family, which governed Byblos through Guy II. Tripoli was very weak at this time and was divided among various factions: the Roman faction led by Paul of Segni, bishop of Tripoli, and the Armenian faction led by Sibylla and Bartholomew. Paul made friends with William of Beaujeu, the new grand master of the Knights Templar, and then with the normally anti-Templar Embriacos. This precipitated the first of a series of wars between Bohemond and the Templars. First, he burned their building in Tripoli. Then, the Templars responded by razing the comital castle of Botron and attacking Nephin. Bohemond marched on Byblos but was defeated and forced to sign a truce.

In 1278, Guy of Byblos and the Templars assaulted Tripoli, but were met outside the walls by Bohemond. Bohemond was defeated, but the Templar fleet of twelve galleys was scattered by a storm and Bohemond&#x27;s fleet of fifteen attacked and damaged Templar Sidon. This time a truce was mediated by Nicolas Lorgne, grand master of the Hospital. The last conflict began in January 1282, when the Embriacos tried to take Tripoli by surprise. They found the Templar master away and so took refuge with the Hospitallers, who handed them over to Bohemond on condition that he would spare their lives. He buried them up to their necks in sand at Nephin and starved them to death. This last act further alienated the Genoese and John of Montfort, but Bohemund beat the latter in taking control of Byblos.

In 1287, Latakia was taken by Qalawun, who claimed that as part of Antioch it did not fall under the conditions of their treaty. Bohemond died soon after, leaving no children by his wife Margaret of Beaumont. Tripoli was plunged into a succession crisis until his sister Lucia arrived from Europe to take control of the county.

<text>Michael Lewis MacLennan (born June 5, 1968) is a Canadian playwright, television writer and television producer, best known as a writer and producer of television series such as &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; and &quot;Bomb Girls&quot;.

As a playwright he is a two-time nominee for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language drama, and the only playwright to win the Herman Voaden Playwriting Competition twice.

==Career==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, MacLennan began his career as a stage actor. In his first theatre role at age 13, he was cast to play a woman, and later in his career he produced a short performance piece about his fear at the time that his parents would see the play and realize that he was gay. He moved to Victoria in 1986 to study English at the University of Victoria.

His first full-length play, &quot;Beat the Sunset&quot;, premiered at the Victoria Fringe Festival in 1993. It was later staged in Vancouver in 1995, winning MacLennan a Jessie Award for outstanding emerging playwright and the Theatrum National Playwriting Competition.

His second play, &quot;Leaning Over Railings&quot;, premiered in 1995. His 1996 &quot;Grace&quot; won the Theatre BC National Playwriting Competition, and has been produced across Canada and internationally. During this era, he also wrote a number of short one-act plays, including &quot;Wake No Clocks&quot; and &quot;Come On!&quot;.

He then began to study screenwriting at the Canadian Film Centre, although he continued to write plays during this time. He won the Herman Voaden Playwrighting Competition in 1998 for his play &quot;The Shooting Stage&quot;, and in 2001 for &quot;Last Romantics&quot;. Both plays were later nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English drama, &quot;The Shooting Stage&quot; at the 2002 Governor General&#x27;s Awards and &quot;Last Romantics&quot; at the 2003 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

He began his television career as writer and story editor for Sullivan Entertainment&#x27;s television series &quot;Wind at My Back&quot;, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Super Rupert&quot;. He then became a writer and co-executive producer on &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, writing 14 episodes over four seasons. Concurrently with the final season of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, he co-created and produced the Citytv dramedy series &quot;Godiva&#x27;s&quot; in 2005.

In 2006, he created a theatrical adaptation of Douglas Coupland&#x27;s novel &quot;Life After God&quot;, resulting in Coupland inviting him to write and coproduce the television series adaptation of Coupland&#x27;s novel &quot;jPod&quot;.

He was cocreator and executive producer of &quot;Bomb Girls&quot;, which premiered in 2011.

His other credits as a writer and producer have included &quot;The Guard&quot;, &quot;Being Erica&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, &quot;Bitten&quot; and &quot;The Fosters&quot;.

<doc id="790377" wikidata="Q4167318" url="?curid=790377" title="Dow's Lake">
<text>Dow&#x27;s Lake in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada is a small man-made lake on the Rideau Canal, situated two kilometres north of Hog&#x27;s Back Falls in the middle of Ottawa. It is at the southern end of Preston Street, just south of Carling Avenue, and just to the west of Bronson Avenue. At the southern end of the lake is Carleton University, and to its west is the Dominion Arboretum, at the edge of the Central Experimental Farm.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The lake is named after Abram Dow, an American-born settler who came to Ontario in the early 19th century and who owned land in this area in 1816. Before construction of the canal, this area was known as Dow&#x27;s Great Swamp. The lake was created when a dam was constructed along the north shore (Queen Elizabeth Driveway is now atop the dam) to allow flooding for the canal. Originally, the Rideau Canal was to run north from Dow&#x27;s Lake, but land speculation and Colonel John By&#x27;s reluctance to reward such speculation resulted in the current location of the canal.

===20th-century developments===
Current parkland to the north and east consisted of rail yards until the 1940s, and the area was mostly industrial.

Situated next to the pavilion on the western shore is Canadian Forces Reserve Barrack Dow&#x27;s Lake. This installation, opened in 1943, is home to HMCS Carleton, a unit of the Canadian Naval Reserve.

A rail tunnel, which was formerly owned and operated by Canadian Pacific, passes under the lake. This tunnel replaced a rail line that once crossed the lake on the surface. OC Transpo introduced the O-Train (today&#x27;s Trillium Line) in 2001, a light-rail transit system, which remains the primary user of the tunnel.
Unveiled by Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, &quot;The Man with Two Hats&quot; is a 4.6-metre sculpture by . It commemorates the role played by the Canadian Armed Forces in the liberation of the Netherlands, and a reproduced cast of the sculpture that exists at the National Canadian Liberation Monument in Apeldoorn, Netherlands. Facing the lake, it symbolizes the historical links between Canada and the Netherlands, as well as Princess Margriet&#x27;s birth at the Ottawa Civic Hospital during the Second World War.

==Visitor activities==
In May, the surrounding park, Commissioners Park, displays tulips planted by the National Capital Commission (NCC) for the annual Canadian Tulip Festival. More than 50 varieties and approximately 300,000 tulips bloom each May along the Rideau Canal. Each year, the Dutch royal family sends 10,000 tulips to Ottawa, as thanks for the city&#x27;s support during the Second World War. 

During the winter, Dow&#x27;s Lake freezes and becomes part of the world&#x27;s longest skating rink and one of the primary sites of the Winterlude festival in February, with events such as &quot;bed races&quot; and &quot;waiter races&quot; on the ice.

There are two scenic drives along the canal, which also pass on two sides of the lake. The Queen Elizabeth Driveway, named after the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (who traveled along it during the 1939 royal visit) runs along the north and west sides of the lake. The Colonel By Drive, named after the founder of the city, Lieutenant-Colonel John By, runs along the south side of the lake.

At the northern end of the lake, a pavilion housing three restaurants overlooks the water. They are Umbrella Bar, Lago and Mexi&#x27;s. Other services at the pavilion include rentals of canoes, kayaks and paddle boats, boat mooring, and an indoor changing area for skating. It is open year-round.

<text>WestCAT is a public transportation service in western Contra Costa County (north of Oakland, CA). It is a service of the Western Contra Costa Transit Authority.

The Western Contra Costa County Transit (WestCAT) was established in August 1977 as a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement between Contra Costa County and the cities of Hercules and Pinole. It was created with the purpose of owning, operating and administering a public transportation system serving the area between the Richmond/El Sobrante border to the west and the Al Zampa Memorial Bridge to the east. WestCAT is governed by a 7-member Board of Directors and supported by professional staff of seven. The two cities of Pinole and Hercules are each represented by two board members, while the unincorporated communities of Crockett, Rodeo, and Montalvin Manor each have one representative, appointed by the Contra Costa Board of Supervisors.

WestCAT&#x27;s fleet started out with shuttle vans, and then using buses made by El Dorado National and Thomas Built Buses. Now, WestCAT runs an almost all Gillig fleet, ranging from 19 Gillig Phantoms, to 18 Gillig Low Floors. WestCAT also has five Motor Coach Industries (MCI) over-the-road coaches and three Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses for use on the LYNX. In addition, WestCAT has 10 Ford E-450 Paratransit vans, and 2 Toyota Camry hybrid electric sedans used for Dial-A-Ride.

<doc id="790391" wikidata="Q3747977" url="?curid=790391" title="Ford Pampa">
<text>The Ford Pampa is a coupe utility manufactured by Ford do Brasil between 1982 and 1997. It was derived from the Ford Corcel and Ford Del Rey, and was the best-selling coupe utility in Brazil for several years.

The Ford Pampa was replaced by the Fiesta-based Ford Courier in the small pickup market of South America.

==The launch==
In 1982, Ford do Brasil launched the pickup based on the Ford Corcel II. It was the second such vehicle in the segment, then after the Fiat Fiorino (known at the time as the City), pickup derived from the Fiat 147. The name Pampa alludes to a horse that has the body all threshed. The Pampa had the comfort of a car in the cabin, but the robustness of a utility vehicle with a more superior load capacity than its smaller competitor. It had the front of a Corcel II and a loading bay inspired by the much larger US-style F-100 pickup of the time. The difference between the Fiat pickup and the Ford is that the former used the same independent back suspension of Fiat 147, whereas the Ford had a rigid rear axle and adopted semielliptical springs in place of coil springs, more suitable for carrying heavy loads. Due to its success, other brands soon followed suit in launching their own derivatives, Volkswagen with the Saveiro (appearing in the same year, it was derived from the Volkswagen Gol hatchback) and Chevrolet with Chevy 500 (derived from the Chevette) in 1983.

==Technical specifications==
Using the same 1.6-liter engine and a four- or five-speed manual gearbox from the Corcel, came with the differential of Corcel 1:4 to better use to advantage the force of the engine. It also had the front suspension of the Corcel, with stiffer springs and shock absorbers to support bigger loads. Thus, the Pampa was perfect for the transport of loads up to . With regard to the Corcel, the wheelbase was also increased. The fuel tank in the Pampa was soon moved to behind the cabin, and its doors were made smaller - identical to the ones of the four-door Ford Del Rey. With the 1.6 engine, the Pampa developed , perfect for the transport of the most varied loads and with the model which ran on alcohol. The Pampa pickup had very good general performance. Its maximum speed was of and its fuel tank had a 76-liter capacity. The Pampa’s options included a digital clock, air conditioning, adjustable head restraints, radio, and inertia reel seat belts. Many of these items were found in the luxurious Del Rey.

==1984-model revisions==
Revisions for the 1984 model year included the Pampa receiving the Ford CHT engine, which was more powerful and economical. The 1.6-liter CHT engine developed in alcohol form and the petrol version , giving the Pampa a maximum speed of , respectively. Also for the 1984 model year, a 4x4 version was launched, which would be only Brazilian pickup derived from a two-wheel drive car to be offered with four-wheel drive. Externally, the 4x4 Pampa had few differences compared with the 4x2 version; the 4x4 had squared-off grating in the grille, off-road tires, free-wheeling wheel hubs, and over-riders on the bumpers.

==1986-model revisions==
In 1986, L and GL models were introduced and Pampa models received the front from the 4x4 version. For the 1987 model year, the Pampa got the new front from the Del the Rey and the Ghia version was added to the range with the luxury equipment of the Del Rey Ghia, including electric windows. However, air conditioning was only an optional extra. For the Pampa in 1989, the larger VW AP-1800 engine became available for the L, GL, and Ghia versions, although the 1.6-liter CHT engine remained in the L and GL 4x4 versions. For 1991, the S version arrived, with the same 1.8-liter motor as the Gol GTS and Escort XR3. This was more powerful and quicker, enabling a top speed of . Standard equipment included side rubbing strakes, a dipping rear view mirror, optional hydraulic power-assisted steering, alloy wheels, front spoiler with integral fog lights and items which were standard on the Ghia version.

==1992-model revisions and final production==

In 1992, the Pampa received another new front, identical to the Del Rey, which had been discontinued in 1991. In 1994, it received an electronically controlled carburettor (2E CE) in the 1.8-liter versions, following the alterations to the VW AP-1800 unit. In 1995, the Ghia and 1.6 L GL 4x4 were discontinued, leaving the 1.6- and 1.8-liter L, 1.8-liter GL, and 1.8-liter S. For the 1997 model year, the 1.8-liter engines were equipped with single-point electronic fuel injection. By the end of production in 1997, in excess of 350,000 units had been sold. Its replacement, the Ford Courier, never achieved the same sales success.

<text>Emery Go-Round is a fare-free public bus system in Emeryville, California. It also provides service to small portions of the adjacent cities of Oakland and Berkeley. Service is funded primarily by commercial property owners through a citywide transportation business improvement district. The name, a play on the term merry-go-round, is a reference to both Emeryville founder Joseph Stickney Emery and the bus routes, which are loops beginning and ending at MacArthur BART Station.

As of 2024, Emery Go-Round operates two fixed routes: Shellmound-Powell and Hollis. Service operates daily with 15-minute frequency, except on selected holidays, with reduced service levels on weekends and selected additional holidays. Both routes are looped, beginning and ending at MacArthur BART Station in Oakland. The Shellmound-Powell route runs concurrently with AC Transit&#x27;s Line 57 (fare required) from Emeryville Public Market to MacArthur BART.

<text>Flatterland is a 2001 book written by mathematician and science popularizer Ian Stewart about non-Euclidean geometry. It was written as a sequel to &quot;Flatland&quot;, an 1884 novel that discussed different dimensions.

==Plot summary==

Almost 100 years after A. (which we find out stands for Albert) Square&#x27;s adventures that were related in &quot;Flatland&quot;, his great-great-granddaughter, Victoria Line (Vikki), finds a copy of his book in her basement. This prompts her to invite a sphere from Spaceland to visit her, but instead she is visited by the &quot;Space Hopper&quot; (a character looking somewhat like the &quot;Space Hopper&quot; children&#x27;s toy with a gigantic grin, horns and a spherical body). The Space Hopper, more than being able to move between Flatland and Spaceland, can travel to any space in the &quot;Mathiverse&quot;, a set of all imaginable worlds. After showing Vikki higher dimensions, he begins showing her more modern theories, such as fractional dimensions and dimensions with isolated points. Topology and hyperbolic geometry are also discussed, as well as the Projective &quot;Plain&quot; (complete with intersecting &quot;lions&quot;) and the quantum level. Hopper and Victoria also visit the Domain of the Hawk King to discuss time travel and the theory of relativity.

# You have fallen into the black hole. A future version of yourself (4) appears and gives you a portable white hole. You use the portable white hole to escape the black hole.
# Another future version of yourself (6) appears and gives you a time machine.
# You go back into the black hole and give the past version of yourself (2) the portable white hole.
# You use the time machine to go far enough into the future (i.e. millions of years) that the black hole has evaporated due to Hawking radiation.
# You then travel back in time and give the past version of yourself (3) the time machine.
# You are now outside of the black hole.

The dashed red line indicates the path of the portable white hole (clockwise). The dashed blue line indicates the path of the time machine (counterclockwise). Movement from the bottom towards the top generally indicates movement forward in time (not to scale) and vice versa.

<doc id="790449" wikidata="Q213519" url="?curid=790449" title="Marin Marais">
<text>Marin Marais (; 31 May 1656, in Paris – 15 August 1728, in Paris) was a French composer and viol player. He studied composition with Jean-Baptiste Lully, often conducting his operas, and with master of the bass viol Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe for six months. In 1676 he was hired as a musician to the royal court of Versailles and was successful there, being appointed in 1679 as &quot;ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole,&quot; a title he kept until 1725.

He was the father of the composer Roland Marais (c. 1685 – c. 1750).

==Career==
Marin Marais was a master of the viol, and the leading French composer of music for the instrument. He wrote five books of &quot;Pièces de viole&quot; (1686–1725) for the instrument, generally suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who &quot;founded and firmly established the empire of the viol&quot; (Hubert Le Blanc, 1740). His other works include a book of &quot;Pièces en trio&quot; (1692) and four operas (1693–1709), &quot;Alcyone&quot; (1706) being noted for its tempest scene.

Titon du Tillet included Marais in &quot;Le Parnasse françois&quot;, making the following comments on two of his pieces, &quot;Le Labyrinthe&quot;, perhaps inspired by the labyrinth of Versailles, and &quot;La Gamme&quot;:
As with Sainte-Colombe, little of Marin Marais&#x27; personal life is known after he reached adulthood. Marin Marais married a Parisian, Catherine d&#x27;Amicourt, on 21 September 1676. They had 19 children together.

Facsimiles of all five books of Marais&#x27; &quot;Pièces de viole&quot; are published by Éditions J.M. Fuzeau. A complete critical edition of his instrumental works in seven volumes, edited by John Hsu, is published by Broude Brothers.

Marais is credited with being one of the earliest composers of program music. His work &quot;The Bladder-Stone Operation&quot;, for viola da gamba and harpsichord, includes composer&#x27;s annotations such as &quot;The patient is bound with silken cords&quot; and &quot;He screameth.&quot; The title has often been interpreted as &quot;The Gall-Bladder Operation,&quot; but that surgery was not performed until the late 19th century. Urinary bladder surgery to remove stones was already a medical specialty in Paris in the 17th century.

==References in film==
*Marais and his music were featured in the film &quot;Tous les matins du monde&quot; (1991), an atmospheric, meticulously imagined life of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. Marais&#x27; music figured prominently in that film, including his longer work &quot;Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris&quot; (1723). The role of Marin Marais is played by Gérard Depardieu as an old man and by Guillaume Depardieu as a young man. The soundtrack was done by the violist Jordi Savall.
*A recording of the &quot;Sonnerie&quot; performed on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the cult classic film &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;.

<doc id="790455" wikidata="Q5130878" url="?curid=790455" title="Clearing the cervical spine">
<text>Clearing the cervical spine is the process by which medical professionals determine whether cervical spine injuries exist, mainly regarding cervical fracture. It is generally performed in cases of major trauma. This process can take place in the emergency department or in the field by appropriately trained EMS personnel.

If the patient is obtunded, i.e. has a head injury with altered sensorium, is intoxicated, or has been given potent analgesics, the cervical spine must remain immobilized until a clinical examination becomes possible.

Neurosurgeons or orthopaedic surgeons manage any detected injury. Today, most large centers have spine surgery specialists, that have trained in this field after their orthopedic or neurosurgical residency.

==History and examination==
A medical history and physical examination can be sufficient in clearing the cervical spine. Notable clinical prediction rules to determine which patients need medical imaging are the Canadian C-spine rule and the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS).

The following is based on the NEXUS (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) criteria.

Excluding a cervical spinal injury requires clinical judgement and training.

Under the NEXUS guidelines, when an acute blunt force injury is present, a cervical spine is deemed to not need radiological imaging if all the following criteria are met:

* There is no posterior midline cervical tenderness
* There is no evidence of intoxication
* The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event
* There is no focal neurological deficit (see focal neurological signs)
* There are no painful distracting injuries (e.g., long bone fracture)

==Medical imaging==

===Choice of method===
*In &quot;children&quot;, a CT scan of the neck is indicated in more severe cases such as neurologic deficits, whereas X-ray is preferable in milder cases, by both US and UK guidelines. Swedish guidelines recommend CT rather than X-ray in all children over the age of 5.
*In &quot;adults&quot;, UK guidelines are largely similar as in children. US guidelines, on the other hand, recommend CT in all cases where medical imaging is indicated, and that X-ray is only acceptable where CT is not readily available.

Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful if it is necessary to exclude a ligament injury. The indication for MR spine is a focal neurological deficit. Another indication for MR of the cervical spine is persistent mid-line neck pain or tenderness despite a normal CT in the awake patient.

===Imaging settings===
X-ray consists of a three view cervical x-ray series, adding a swimmer&#x27;s view if the lateral doesn&#x27;t include the C7/T1 interface.

CT scan should be thin slices, ideally 1.5 mm or less. It should include first thoracic vertebra.

===Evaluation===
CT scan or X-ray images are evaluated for the presence or absence of directly visible fractures. In addition, indirect signs of injury by the vertebral column are incongruities of the vertebral lines, and/or increased thickness of the prevertebral space:

==After imaging==
If the patient is not expected to be clinically evaluable within 48–72 hours because of severe head or multiple injuries, they should remain immobilized until a time when such an examination is possible. A 64-slice CT with reconstructions does not entirely rule out ligamentous injury leading to instability, but is a practical means of identifying the majority of C-spine injuries in obtunded patients. MR C-spine has frequent false-positives, limiting its usefulness. In these cases, a consultation with a Spine Surgery specialist is prudent.

<text>Joseph McKenna (August 10, 1843 – November 21, 1926) was an American politician who served in all three branches of the U.S. federal government as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, as U.S. Attorney General and as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He is one of seventeen members of the House of Representatives who subsequently served on the Supreme Court (including two Chief Justices).

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Irish Catholic immigrants, he attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College and the Collegiate Institute in Benicia, California. After being admitted to the California bar in 1865, he entered private practice for one year and then became District Attorney for Solano County and then campaigned for and won a seat in the California State Assembly for two years (1875–1877). He retired after one term and an unsuccessful bid for Speaker.

After two unsuccessful attempts, McKenna was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1885 and served for four terms. While in Congress, he was a &quot;vehement proponent&quot; of Chinese exclusion.

He was appointed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1892 by President Benjamin Harrison.

In 1897 he was appointed the 42nd Attorney General of the United States by President William McKinley, and served in that capacity until 1898.
McKenna was nominated by President McKinley on December 16, 1897, as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to succeed Stephen Johnson Field. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 21, 1898, by a voice vote. He then took the judicial oath of office on January 26, 1898. Conscious of his limited credentials, McKenna attended Columbia Law School for about a month between his nomination and Senate confirmation to improve his legal education before taking his seat on the Court.

Although he never developed a consistent legal philosophy, McKenna was the author of a number of important decisions. One of the most notable was his opinion in the case of &quot;United States v. U.S. Steel Corporation&quot; (1920) which held that antitrust cases would be decided on the &quot;rule of reason&quot; principle—only alleged monopolistic combinations that are in unreasonable restraint of trade are illegal.

He authored 614 majority opinions, and 146 dissenting opinions during his time on the bench. His passionate rebuttal to the denial of &quot;pecuniary benefit&quot; to a wife whose husband had been killed while working on the railroad was among those which brought a change to the Employer Liability Act. One of his most noteworthy opinions was &quot;Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States&quot;, 220 U.S. 45 (1911), in which a unanimous Court upheld the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

In &quot;Hoke v. United States&quot; (1913), he concurred in upholding the Mann Act. However, four years later, he dissented from the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Caminetti v. United States&quot; (1917), which held the act applied to private, noncommercial enticements to cross state lines for purposes of a sexual liaison. According to McKenna, the Act regulated only commercial vice, &quot;i.e.&quot;, &quot;immoralities having a mercenary purpose.&quot;

McKenna wrote &quot;Williams v. Mississippi&quot;, upholding the state&#x27;s racist 1890 Constitution that disenfranchised nearly every African American in the state through poll taxes and literacy tests, while exempting whites through a grandfather clause.

While McKenna was generally quite favorable to federal power, he joined the Court&#x27;s substantive due process jurisprudence and voted with the majority in 1905&#x27;s &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, which struck down a state maximum-hours law for bakery workers. This decision carried broader implications for the scope of federal power, at least until the New Deal and the 1937 switch-in-time-that-saved-nine &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;. (&quot;See&quot; Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937.)

McKenna resigned from the Court in January 1925 at the suggestion of Chief Justice William Howard Taft. McKenna&#x27;s ability to perform his duties had been diminished significantly by a stroke suffered 10 years earlier, and by the end of his tenure McKenna could not be counted on to write coherent opinions.

McKenna was one of 15 Catholic justices (out of the 116 total through the appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson) in the history of the Supreme Court.

McKenna married Amanda Borneman in 1869, and the couple had three daughters and one son. McKenna died on November 21, 1926. in Washington, D.C. His remains are interred at the city&#x27;s Mount Olivet Cemetery.

<doc id="790468" wikidata="Q336574" url="?curid=790468" title="Pulfrich effect">
<text>The Pulfrich effect is a psychophysical percept wherein lateral motion of an object in the field of view is interpreted by the visual cortex as having a depth component, due to a relative difference in signal timings between the two eyes.

==Overview==
The effect is generally induced by placing a dark filter over one eye but can also occur spontaneously in several eye diseases such as cataract, optic neuritis, or multiple sclerosis. In such cases, symptoms such as difficulties judging the paths of oncoming cars have been reported. The phenomenon is named for German physicist Carl Pulfrich, who first described it in 1922. Carl Pulfrich was the brother-in-law of Heinrich Hertz. The effect has been exploited as the basis for some television, film, and game 3D presentations.

==Demonstration==

In the classic Pulfrich effect experiment, a subject views a pendulum swinging in a plane perpendicular to the observer&#x27;s line of sight. When a neutral density filter (a darkened lens—typically gray) is placed in front of, say, the right eye, the pendulum seems to take on an elliptical orbit, appearing closer as it swings toward the right and farther as it swings toward the left, so that if it were to theoretically be viewed from above, it would appear to be revolving counterclockwise. Conversely, if the left eye is covered, the pendulum would appear to be revolving clockwise-from-top, appearing closer as it swings toward the left and farther as it swings toward the right.

A similar effect can be achieved by using a stationary camera and continuously rotating an otherwise stationary object. If the movement stops, the eye looking through the dark lens (which could be either eye depending on the direction the camera is moving) will &quot;catch up&quot; and the effect will disappear. One advantage of this system is that people not wearing the glasses will see a perfectly normal picture.

==Explanation==
The widely accepted explanation of the apparent depth is that a reduction in retinal illumination (relative to the fellow eye) yields a corresponding delay in signal transmission, imparting instantaneous spatial disparity in moving objects. This seems to occur because visual system latencies are generally shorter (i.e., the visual system responds more quickly) for bright targets as compared to dim targets. This motion with depth is the visual system&#x27;s solution to a moving target when a difference in retinal illuminance, and hence a difference in signal latencies, exists between the two eyes.

The Pulfrich effect has typically been measured under full field conditions with dark targets on a bright background, and yields about a 15 ms delay for a factor of ten difference in average retinal illuminance. These delays increase monotonically with decreased luminance over a wide (&gt; 6 log-units) range of luminance. The effect is also seen with bright targets on a black background and exhibits the same luminance-to-latency relationship.

==Use in stereoscopy==
The Pulfrich effect has been utilized to enable a type of stereoscopy, or 3-D visual effect, in visual media such as film and TV. As in other kinds of stereoscopy, glasses are used to create the illusion of a three-dimensional image. By placing a neutral filter (e.g., the darkened lens from a pair of sunglasses) over one eye, an image, as it moves right to left (or left to right, but not up and down) will appear to move in depth, either toward or away from the viewer.

Because the Pulfrich effect depends on motion in a particular direction to instigate the illusion of depth, it is not useful as a general stereoscopic technique. For example, it cannot be used to show a stationary object apparently extending into or out of the screen; similarly, objects moving vertically will not be seen as moving in depth. Incidental movement of objects will create spurious artifacts, and these incidental effects will be seen as artificial depth not related to actual depth in the scene. Many of the applications of Pulfrich involve deliberately causing just this sort of effect, which has given the technique a bad reputation. When the only movement is lateral movement of the camera then the effect is as real as any other form of stereoscopy, but this seldom happens except in highly contrived situations. It can, however, be effective as a novelty effect in contrived visual scenarios. One advantage of material produced to take advantage of the Pulfrich effect is that it is fully backward-compatible with &quot;regular&quot; viewing; unlike stereoscopic (two-image) video, a 3D Pulfrich effect only has one image and as a result does not produce the ghosting effect for those not wearing glasses or the color distortion of technologies such as anaglyph. The Pulfrich effect can also be achieved by wearing a sunglass lens over one eye, and since sunglasses are very common, the need to distribute &quot;special&quot; 3D glasses is reduced.

===Examples===

The effect achieved a small degree of popularity in television in the late 1980s and 1990s. On Sunday, January 22, 1989 the Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a specially produced commercial for &quot;Diet Coke&quot; were telecast using this effect. In the commercial, objects moving in one direction appeared to be nearer to the viewer (actually in front of the television screen) and when moving in the other direction, appeared to be farther from the viewer (behind the television screen). Forty million pairs of paper-framed 3D viewing &quot;glasses&quot; were distributed by Coca-Cola USA for the event (though they were originally produced and intended for a May 1988 3D episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; that never finished production due to a writer&#x27;s strike). The right eye&#x27;s filter was grayed purple (resembling red wine color), while the left was very light amber (resembling white wine color). These colors complemented each other to produce the Pulfrich effect while avoiding distortion in the broadcast&#x27;s natural colors. The commercial was in this case restricted to objects (such as refrigerators and skateboarders) moving down a steep hill from left to right across the screen, a directional dependency determined by which eye was covered by the darker filter. The commercial was said to be created using Nuoptix 3D technology to create the Pulfrich effect.

The effect was also used well throughout the whole 1993 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; and in dream sequences of the 1997 &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; two-part season 2 finale &quot;Nightmare on Dick Street&quot;. In many countries in Europe, a series of short 3D films, produced in the Netherlands, were shown on television. Glasses were sold at a chain of petrol stations. These short films were mainly travelogues of Dutch localities. A &quot;Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue&quot; movie called &quot;Power Rangers in 3D: Triple Force&quot; (later broadcast as two-part &quot;Trakeena&#x27;s Revenge&quot;) sold on VHS through McDonald&#x27;s purportedly used &quot;Circlescan 4D&quot; technology, which is based on the Pulfrich effect, but there was very little 3D present. In the United States and Canada, six million 3D Pulfrich glasses were distributed to viewers for an episode of Discovery Channel&#x27;s Shark Week in 2000. Animated programs that employed the Pulfrich effect in specific segments of its programs include &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot;, &quot;The Bots Master&quot;, and &quot;Space Strikers&quot;; they typically achieved the effect through the use of constantly moving background and foreground layers.

In France, &quot;Le Magazine de la Santé&quot;, a long-lasting popular medicine TV-show, has extensively presented the effect in October 2016, inviting its viewers &quot;to see the program in 3D for the first time&quot;.

Some episodes of the Italian/German TV game show &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; utilised the effect. One of the showgirls stripped topless while others danced around her in an anticlockwise pattern, while two additional rear layers were created by graphics moving at different speeds. It is not known how viewing glasses were distributed. Episodes are widely available on the internet, but only a few use the Pulfrich effect.

The video game &quot;Orb-3D&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System used the effect (by having the player&#x27;s ship always moving) and came packed with a pair of glasses. So did &quot;Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D&quot; for the Super NES, using constantly scrolling backgrounds to cause the effect.

<doc id="790499" wikidata="Q63677" url="?curid=790499" title="The Donna Reed Show">
<text>The Donna Reed Show is an American sitcom starring Donna Reed as the middle-class housewife Donna Stone. Carl Betz co-stars as her pediatrician husband Dr. Alex Stone, and Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen as their teenage children, Mary and Jeff. The show originally aired on ABC from September 24, 1958, to March 19, 1966.

== Background ==
The series was sponsored by Campbell Soup Company, with Johnson &amp; Johnson as the principal alternate sponsor (succeeded in the fall of 1963 by The Singer Company).

This show was the first TV family sitcom to feature the mother as the center of the show. Reed&#x27;s character, Donna Stone, is a loving mother and wife, but also a strong woman, an active participant in her community, a woman with feelings and a sense of humor. According to many of Reed&#x27;s friends and family, Reed shared many similarities to the character that she portrayed on screen, implying that the fictional Donna Stone was a near-identical copy of Reed herself.

In a 2008 interview, Paul Petersen (Jeff Stone) stated:

[&quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;] depicts a better time and place. It has a sort of level of intelligence and professionalism that is sadly lacking in current entertainment products. The messages it sent out were positive and uplifting. The folks you saw were likable, the family was fun, the situations were familiar to people. It provided 22-and-a-half-minutes of moral instructions and advice on how to deal with the little dilemmas of life. Jeff and Mary and their friends had all the same problems that real kids in high school did.

Petersen continued,

That&#x27;s what the show was really about, the importance of family. That&#x27;s where life&#x27;s lessons are transmitted, generation to generation. There&#x27;s a certain way in which these are transmitted, with love and affection.


== Cast changes ==
In season 5, (1963) Mary departed for college, reducing Fabares&#x27;s appearances, something which continued yearly with her role becoming a minor character. Fabares left the full-time cast to pursue opportunities in films. She eventually returned seven times for guest appearances (Season 6 episodes 8, 11, 14; Season 7 episodes 5, 15, 30; Season 8 episode 13). Following Fabares&#x27;s departure, Petersen&#x27;s real-life sister Patty Petersen joined the show as Trisha, a runaway orphan eventually adopted by the Stones. The program achieved its highest Nielsen ratings in Season 6, reaching #16 after Fabares&#x27; departure. A possible reason for higher ratings was the addition of new characters, Ann McCrea and disc jockey-turned actor Bob Crane as the Stones&#x27; neighbors, Midge and Dave Kelsey. This not only provided both Donna and Alex with best friends, but co-conspirators, as well. So popular were their roles that by the fall of 1964, both McCrea and Crane began receiving billing in the opening credits of the program. Crane left the series in 1965 to star in the CBS sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. As a result, he was written out of the show although his character continued to be referred to and McCrea&#x27;s character remained with the program. Also, towards the end of the series, actor Darryl Richard was regularly featured as Jeff Stone&#x27;s best friend, Morton &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith. Richard first appeared in 1962 and &quot;Smitty&quot; became a major character after Season 6. Janet Landgard was a series regular from 1963 to 1965 as Karen Holmby.

<text>Clinton Charles Augustus Ritchie (August 9, 1938 – January 31, 2009) was an American actor.

==Early life==
Ritchie was born on a farm near Grafton, North Dakota, to J. C. and Charlotte Ritchie, and his family moved to Washington state when he was seven. Voted &quot;Handsome Harry&quot; by his classmates at Sunnyside High School, he moved to California at the age of 16 where he had a variety of jobs: truck driver, service station attendant, furniture factory worker, bartender (before his age of 19 was found out) and health club manager, before becoming an actor.

==Career==

Ritchie is best known for his acting role as Clint Buchanan, husband of heroine Victoria Lord (played by Erika Slezak) on the ABC soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He originated the character in 1979 and portrayed the role through 1998, with recurring stints in 1999, 2003, and 2004.

He was under contract at 20th Century Fox with Tom Selleck and is credited with teaching Selleck how to ride a horse.

He co-starred and guest starred in numerous television Westerns during the 1950s and 1960s, including the 1965 pilot for the long-running &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot;. He also appeared in the TV series &quot;Batman&quot; as well as in many films, including &quot;First to Fight&quot; (1967), &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; (1967), &quot;Bandolero!&quot; (1968), &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972), &quot;Against a Crooked Sky&quot; (1975), &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;Poco... Little Dog Lost&quot; (1977) and &quot;A Force of One&quot; (1979). In &quot;Patton&quot;, he portrayed a wounded tank commander who briefs Patton on a fierce night battle. His television movie roles included &quot;The Bastard&quot;, &quot;Centennial&quot; and &quot;Desperate Women&quot;. Later, he appeared on &quot;Roseanne&quot; as Clint Buchanan, with his &quot;One Life to Live&quot; costars Robert S. Woods and John Loprieno.

Ritchie was critically injured at his California ranch on May 10, 1993, when his John Deere tractor upended, knocked him to the ground, and rolled over him. Quoted as saying that he could hear his own ribs cracking, he survived and returned to the &quot;One Life to Live&quot; set after recuperating. In the interim, his costar Slezak fought not to have his role recast with another actor. Clint was written off temporarily as having been in an airplane crash while Ritchie recuperated.

Ritchie retired in December 1998, and said that he believed the character of Clint had been damaged during the 1992 Viki-Clint-Sloan Carpenter love triangle story. He lived at his California ranch, with his numerous dogs and cats, and 43 horses. He purchased the ranch, named the Happy Horse Ranch, in 1980 largely due to its location near Grass Valley, which is located near the site of the annual Tevis Cup 100-mile endurance horse race. His character on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; had a ranch in Arizona with the same name, and several of Ritchie&#x27;s horses had been used on the show.

==Death==
In late January 2009, Ritchie had surgery to implant a pacemaker. Although the surgery was a success, a blood clot traveled to his brain, resulting in a massive stroke. He died a few days later about 4:00 a.m. on January 31, 2009, aged 70. His friend and costar Phil Carey, who played his father Asa Buchanan on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, died of lung cancer six days after Ritchie&#x27;s death. Ritchie was cremated.

<text>Howell Cobb (September 7, 1815 – October 9, 1868) was an American and later Confederate political figure. A southern Democrat, Cobb was a five-term member of the United States House of Representatives and the speaker of the House from 1849 to 1851. He also served as the 40th governor of Georgia (1851–1853) and as a secretary of the treasury under President James Buchanan (1857–1860).

Cobb is, however, best known as one of the founders of the Confederacy, having served as the President of the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States where delegates of the Southern slave states declared that they had seceded from the United States and created the Confederate States of America.

==Early life and education==
Born in Jefferson County, Georgia in 1815, son of Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Rootes) and John A. Cobb. Cobb was of Welsh American ancestry. He was raised in Athens and attended the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. He was admitted to the bar in 1836 and became solicitor general of the western judicial circuit of Georgia.

Cobb was a presidential elector in the 1836 presidential election.

He married Mary Ann Lamar on May 26, 1835. She was a daughter of Colonel Zachariah Lamar, of Milledgeville, from a prominent family with broad connections in the South. Her relatives include Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar and Georgia resident Gazaway Bugg Lamar. They would have eleven children, the first in 1838 and the last in 1861. Several did not survive childhood, including their last, a son who was named after Howell&#x27;s brother, Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb.

==Career==

===Congressman===


Cobb was elected as Democrat to the 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Congresses. He was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Mileage during the 28th Congress, and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives during the 31st Congress.

He sided with President Andrew Jackson on the question of nullification (i.e. compromising on import tariffs), and was an effective supporter of President James K. Polk&#x27;s administration during the Mexican–American War. He was an ardent advocate of extending slavery into the territories, but when the Compromise of 1850 had been agreed upon, he became its staunch supporter as a Union Democrat. He joined Georgia Whigs Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs in a statewide campaign to elect delegates to a state convention that overwhelmingly affirmed, in the Georgia Platform, that the state accepted the Compromise as the final resolution to the outstanding slavery issues. On that issue, Cobb was elected governor of Georgia by a large majority.

===Speaker of the House===
After 63 ballots, he became Speaker of the House on December 22, 1849, at the age of 34. In 1850—following the July 9 death of Zachary Taylor and the accession of Millard Fillmore to the presidency—Cobb, as Speaker, would have been next in line to the presidency for two days due to the resultant vice presidential vacancy and a president pro tempore of the Senate vacancy, except he did not meet the minimum eligibility for the presidency of being 35 years old. The Senate elected William R. King as president pro tempore on July 11.

===Governor of Georgia===
In 1851, Cobb left the House to serve as the Governor of Georgia, holding that post until 1853. He published &quot;A Scriptural Examination of the Institution of Slavery in the United States: With its Objects and Purposes&quot; in 1856.

===Return to Congress and Secretary of the Treasury===

He was elected to the 34th Congress before being appointed as Secretary of the Treasury in Buchanan&#x27;s Cabinet. He served for three years, resigning in December 1860. At one time, Cobb was Buchanan&#x27;s choice for his successor.

===A Founder of the Confederacy===
In 1860, Cobb ceased to be a Unionist, and became a leader of the secession movement, not surprising since he once owned 1000 slaves. He was president of a convention of the seceded states that assembled in Montgomery, Alabama, on February 4, 1861. Under Cobb&#x27;s guidance, the delegates drafted a constitution for the new Confederacy. He served as president of several sessions of the Confederate Provisional Congress, and swore in Jefferson Davis as president of the Confederacy before resigning to join the military when war erupted.

===American Civil War===


Cobb joined the Confederate army and was commissioned as colonel of the 16th Georgia Infantry. He was appointed a brigadier general on February 13, 1862, and assigned command of a brigade in what became the Army of Northern Virginia. Between February and June 1862, he represented the Confederate authorities in negotiations with Union officers for an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war. His efforts in these discussions contributed to the Dix-Hill Cartel accord reached in July 1862.

Cobb saw combat during the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. Cobb&#x27;s brigade played a key role in the fighting during the Battle of South Mountain, especially at Crampton&#x27;s Gap, where it arrived at a critical time to delay a Union advance through the gap, but at a bloody cost. His men also fought at the subsequent Battle of Antietam.

In October 1862, Cobb was detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to the District of Middle Florida. He was promoted to major general on September 9, 1863, and placed in command of the District of Georgia and Florida. He suggested the construction of a prisoner-of-war camp in southern Georgia, a location thought to be safe from Union incursions. This idea led to the creation of the infamous Andersonville prison.

When William T. Sherman&#x27;s armies entered Georgia during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign and subsequent March to the Sea, Cobb commanded the Georgia Reserve Corps as a general. In the spring of 1865, with the Confederacy clearly waning, he and his troops were sent to Columbus, Georgia to help oppose Wilson&#x27;s Raid. He led the hopeless Confederate resistance in the Battle of Columbus, Georgia on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865.

During Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, the army camped one night near Cobb&#x27;s plantation. When Sherman discovered that the house he planned to stay in for the night belonged to Cobb, whom Sherman described in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; as &quot;one of the leading rebels of the South, then a general in the Southern army,&quot; he dined in Cobb&#x27;s slave quarters, confiscated Cobb&#x27;s property and burned the plantation, instructing his subordinates to &quot;spare nothing.&quot;

In the closing days of the war, Cobb fruitlessly opposed General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s eleventh hour proposal to enlist slaves into the Confederate Army. Fearing that such a move would completely discredit the Confederacy&#x27;s fundamental justification of slavery, that black people were inferior, he said, &quot;You cannot make soldiers of slaves, or slaves of soldiers. The day you make a soldier of them is the beginning of the end of the Revolution. And if slaves seem good soldiers, then our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot;

Cobb surrendered to the U.S. at Macon, Georgia on April 20, 1865.

==Later life and death==

Following the end of the Civil War, Cobb returned home and resumed his law practice. Despite pressure from his former constituents and soldiers, he refused to make any public remarks on Reconstruction policy until he received a presidential pardon, although he privately opposed the policy. Finally receiving the pardon in early 1868, he began to vigorously oppose the Reconstruction Acts, making a series of speeches that summer that bitterly denounced the policies of Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress.

That autumn, Cobb vacationed in New York City, and died of a heart attack there. His body was returned to Athens, Georgia, for burial in Oconee Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
As a former Speaker of the House, his portrait had been on display in the US Capitol. The portrait was removed from public display in the Speaker&#x27;s Lobby outside the House Chamber after an order issued by the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi on June 18, 2020, during the George Floyd protests.

== Cobb family ==
The Cobb family included many prominent Georgians from both before and after the Civil War era. Cobb&#x27;s uncle and namesake, also Howell Cobb, had been a U.S. Congressman from 1807 to 1812, and then served as an officer in the War of 1812.

Cobb&#x27;s younger brother, Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, was also a politician and soldier and was killed in the Civil War. Thomas Willis Cobb, a member of the United States Congress and namesake of Georgia&#x27;s Cobb County, was a cousin. His niece Mildred Lewis &quot;Miss Millie&quot; Rutherford was a prominent educator, white supremacy advocate, and leader in the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Howell Cobb&#x27;s daughter, Mrs. Alexander S. (Mary Ann Lamar Cobb) Erwin, was responsible for creating the United Daughters of the Confederacy&#x27;s Southern Cross of Honor in 1899, which was awarded to Confederate Veterans. His son, Andrew J. Cobb, served as a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court.

<doc id="790574" wikidata="Q6704012" url="?curid=790574" title="Lunchables">
<text>Lunchables is an American brand of food and snacks manufactured by Kraft Heinz in Chicago, Illinois, and marketed under the Oscar Mayer brand. They were initially introduced in Seattle in 1988 before being released nationally in 1989. Many Lunchables products are produced in a Garland, Texas, facility, and are then distributed across the United States.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Lunchables were originally marketed by Kraft Foods Inc. and its successor Mondelez as &quot;Dairylea Lunchables&quot;. In 2023, Mondelez renamed the line &quot;Dairylea Lunchers&quot;.

==History==

Lunchables was designed in 1985 by Bob Drane as a way for Oscar Mayer to sell more bologna and other lunch meat. After organizing focus groups of American mothers, Drane discovered that their primary concern was time. Working mothers, especially, were pressed by the time constraints of fixing breakfast for their families as well as packing lunch for their children to eat at school. This gave Drane the idea of creating a convenient prepackaged lunch featuring Oscar Mayer&#x27;s trademark lunch meats. Crackers were substituted for bread because they would last longer in grocery coolers. The cheese was provided by Kraft when Oscar Mayer merged with Kraft in 1988. The design of the package was based on the look of an American TV dinner.

The term &#x27;Lunchables&#x27; emerged from a list of possible names for the prepackaged meal that included, among others: On-Trays, Crackerwiches, Mini Meals, Lunch Kits, Snackables, Square Meals, Walk Meals, Go-Packs, and Fun Mealz.

==Combinations==
Lunchables offers 30 different kinds of meal variety combinations, which include crackers, pizzas, chicken nuggets, small hot dogs, small burgers, nachos, subs, and wraps. A typical package, such as the cracker meal combination, contains an equal number of crackers and small slices of meat and cheese. The brand also created two versions targeting adults, by increasing the amount of food offered in each package, but these have since been discontinued. The first was called the &quot;Deluxe&quot; and contained two types of meats and cheeses, as well as a mustard condiment and a mint. The second version, called &quot;Maxed Out&quot; (originally &quot;Mega Packs&quot;), was available with 40% more food than a regular Lunchables.

Lunchables also carries an assortment of drinks and desserts. In certain meal combinations, Capri-Sun juice drinks are offered, either in a traditional flavor or the &quot;Roarin&#x27; Waters&quot; variant. Other drinks included are bottled water and a generic, unlabeled small can of cola; however, it was later replaced with Capri Sun drinks due to health concerns. As for dessert, some packages contain Jell-O gelatin or pudding or a candy alternative, such as Butterfingers or Reese&#x27;s cups. Other desserts also include Oreos, chocolate chip cookies, and vanilla cookies.

As of 2022, the varieties of Lunchables (as they were then known) available in the UK were more limited in comparison to the 1990s and 2000s. The burger, pizza, hot dog, and sub varieties were no longer sold, and the product was mostly limited to crackers, cheese, and ham or chicken although there was a Snackers brand of cheese and crackers with Cadbury Buttons, mini Fingers or Oreos. Many varieties, including turkey, ham, sausage, hot dogs, and pizza, are still sold in Canada, but they are sold by Maple Leaf Foods under the name &quot;Lunch Mate&quot;.

A line of trays called Maxed Out was eventually released that had as many as nine grams of saturated fat, or nearly an entire day&#x27;s recommended maximum for children, with up to two-thirds of the maximum for sodium and 65 grams (13 tsp) of sugar. Regarding the shift toward more salt, sugar, and fat in meals for kids, Geoffrey Bible, former CEO of Philip Morris USA (prior owner of Kraft Foods), remarked that he read an article that said: &quot;If you take Lunchables apart, the most healthy item in it is the napkin.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 1997, Lunchables came under fire for having high saturated fat and sodium content while being marketed as a healthy children&#x27;s meal. For example, a single serving of Ham and Swiss Lunchables contained 1,780 milligrams of sodium, which is 47% of the recommended daily allowance for an adult.

Due to the growing concern of childhood obesity, UK Lunchers opted to create healthier options for children by eliminating Capri Sun drinks and mini Daim bars and replacing the sugary drink and candy with orange juice and strawberry yogurt in 2004. The brand also began offering lower-calorie candy alternatives rather than including the standard Reese&#x27;s cup in the package. Capri Sun and candy are still available as options in U.S. Lunchables. Lunchables were listed among the Cancer Project&#x27;s &quot;Five Worst Packaged Lunchbox Meals&quot; in 2009.

A 2024 report by Consumer Reports found a high concentration of lead and phthalates (a chemical family known for causing hormone disruption) as well as high levels of sodium in Lunchables products. Consumer Reports asked the USDA to remove Lunchables products from the National School Lunch Program.

<doc id="790583" wikidata="Q548097" url="?curid=790583" title="Visegrád, Hungary">
<text>Visegrád (; ; or ; ) is a castle town in Pest County, Hungary. It is north of Budapest on the right bank of the Danube in the Danube Bend. It had a population of 1,864 in 2010. The town is the site of the remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and a medieval citadel. The town was also the site of a meeting on 15 February 1991 between the President of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, Václav Havel, the President of the Republic of Poland, Lech Wałęsa, and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Hungary, József Antall which founded the titular Visegrád group.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Visegrád&quot; (&quot;Vyšehrad&quot;) is of Slavic origin, meaning acropolis, literally &quot;the upper castle&quot; (the castle with a privileged position) or &quot;the upper settlement&quot;. In modern Slovak and Czech, the form is &quot;Vyšehrad&quot;.

The castle of Visegrád is called &quot;Fellegvár&quot; (Citadel) in Hungarian, In German, the town is called &quot;Plintenburg&quot;. The German name &quot;Plintenburg&quot; or &quot;Blendenburg&quot; is said to come from the beautiful view that one has from the castle and is &quot;blinded&quot;/&quot;dazzled&quot; by this view.

==History==
Visegrád was first mentioned in 1009 as a county town and the chief town of an archdeaconry. After the destructive Mongol invasion of Europe in 1242, the town was rebuilt in a slightly different location to the south. King Charles I of Hungary made Visegrád the royal seat of Hungary in 1325. At the same time, his diplomat Stephen Sáfár was appointed castellan.

In 1335, Charles hosted at Visegrád a two-month congress with the Bohemian king, John of Luxembourg, and the Polish king, Casimir III. It was crucial in creating a peace between the three kingdoms and securing an alliance between Poland and Hungary against Habsburg Austria. Another congress followed in 1339.

Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary and Croatia in personal union with Hungary, moved the royal seat to Buda between 1405 and 1408. King Matthias Corvinus (1443–1490), King of Hungary, used Visegrád as a country residence.

Visegrád lost importance after the partition of the Kingdom of Hungary following the Battle of Mohács in 1526. It was captured by the Ottomans under Suleiman the Magnificent in 1529. In 1532, King Zápolya besieged Visegrád and took it. In 1540, after the death of Zápolya, Habsburg general Leonhard Fels took the city, as well as Vác, Pest, Tata and Székesfehérvár. Because the city threatened the lines of communication between Buda and Esztergom, Yahyapaşaoğlu Mehmed Paşa of Buda took it in 1544 (possibly April 23, before May 10). 

In February 1991, the leading politicians of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland met here to form a periodical forum, the Visegrád Group, with an intentional allusion to the meeting centuries earlier in 1335.

Visegrád was granted town privileges again in 2000.

==Monuments==

===Upper Castle===
After the Mongol invasion, King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife had a new fortification system constructed in the 1240s and 1250s near the one destroyed earlier. The first part of the new system was the Upper Castle on top of a high hill. The castle was laid out on a triangular ground plan and had three towers at its corners. In the 14th century, at the time of the Angevin kings of Hungary, the castle became a royal residence and was enlarged with a new curtain wall and palace buildings.

Around 1400 King Sigismund had a third curtain wall constructed and enlarged the palace buildings. At the end of the 15th century, King Matthias Corvinus had the interior renovated. The Upper Castle also served for the safekeeping of the Hungarian royal insignia between the 14th century and 1526. In 1544 Visegrád was occupied by the Ottoman Empire, and, apart from a short period in 1595–1605, it remained in Turkish hands until 1685. The castle was seriously damaged by the Turks and was never used afterwards.

The castle is now open to the public to visit.

===Lower Castle===
The Lower Castle is the part of the fortification system that connects the Upper Castle with the Danube. In its centre rises the Solomon Tower, a large, hexagonal residential tower dating from the 13th century. In the 14th century, new curtain walls were built around the tower. During a Turkish raid in 1544, the southern part of the tower collapsed. Its renovation began only in the 1870s and was finished in the 1960s.

At present, the Tower houses exhibitions installed by the King Matthias Museum (Mátyás Király Múzeum) of Visegrád. The exhibitions present the reconstructed Gothic fountains from the Royal Palace, Renaissance sculpture in Visegrád, and the history of Visegrád.

===Royal Palace===
The first royal house on this site was built by King Charles I of Hungary after 1325. In the second half of the 14th century, this was enlarged into a palace by his son, King Louis I of Hungary.

In the last third of the 14th century, King Louis and his successor Sigismund of Luxembourg had the majority of the earlier buildings dismantled and created a new, sumptuous palace complex, the extensive ruins of which are still visible today. The palace complex was laid out on a square ground plan measuring 123 x 123 m. A garden adjoined to it from the north and a Franciscan friary, founded by King Sigismund in 1424, from the south. In the time of Louis I and Sigismund, the palace was the official residence of the kings of Hungary until about 1405–08.

Between 1477 and 1484 Matthias Corvinus had the palace complex reconstructed in late Gothic style. The Italian Renaissance architectural style was used for decoration, the first time the style appeared in Europe outside Italy. After the Ottoman Turks&#x27; siege in 1544, the palace fell into ruins. By the 18th century it was completely covered by earth. Its excavation began in 1934 and continues today.

The reconstructed royal residence building is open to the public and houses exhibitions on the history of the palace and reconstructed historical interiors.

=== Sibrik Hill ===
The ruins of this military camp can be seen outside Visegrád, to the north, on a hill that overlooks the Danube. The camp has a triangular ground plan. It was built in the first half of the 4th century as one of the important fortifications along the limes, the frontier of the Roman Empire. Its praetorium (the commander&#x27;s building) was constructed at the end of the 4th century. In the early 5th century, the Roman army abandoned the military camp.

In the 10th and 11th centuries, the fortification, rebuilt as a castle, became a regional centre of the recently formed Hungarian state. &quot;Visegrád&quot; appears for the first time as the name of this regional centre (1009). The fortification was finally destroyed in 1242 by the Mongol invasion of Europe.

<text>Sir Donald Burns Sangster ON GCVO
(26 October 1911 – 11 April 1967) was a Jamaican solicitor and politician, and the second Prime Minister of Jamaica.

==Early life==

Donald Burns Sangster was born in Black River in the parish of St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. His father William B. Sangster was a land surveyor and a planter. His mother&#x27;s name is Cassandra Sangster (née Plummer).
Sangster attended the prestigious Munro College in St. Elizabeth.

==Political career==

He entered politics at the age of 21 in 1933, when he was elected to the Parish Council of St Elizabeth, Jamaica. In 1944 he was elected to the House of Representatives of Jamaica as a member of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). He then went on to become Minister of Social Welfare and Labour and later, Minister of Finance. He was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister on 11 March 1963. He became Acting Prime Minister in February 1964 when Prime Minister Sir Alexander Bustamante became ill.

On 21 February, in the 1967 Jamaican general election, the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.

He succeeded Bustamante as Prime Minister on 23 February 1967, and he only had one cabinet meeting before he fell ill less than two weeks later and became the only prime minister to die in office on 11 April, after suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

His face appears on the Jamaican five thousand dollar banknote alongside Hugh Shearer. Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay is named after him.

==Knighthood==

Sangster was taken ill on 18 March 1967, and was flown by the U.S. government to the Montreal Neurological Institute for specialist treatment. He went into a coma a few weeks later on 1 April, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during that period; he died 10 days later.

<doc id="790606" wikidata="Q2606599" url="?curid=790606" title="La Polla Records">
<text>La Polla Records was a punk rock band from the Basque Country, formed in 1979 in Salvatierra/Agurain, a small town in Álava, Spain. Its founders were Evaristo Páramos &quot;Evaristo&quot; on vocals, Maleguin on bass, Fernandito on drums and Txarly and Sumé on guitars. The name was somewhat controversial because in Spanish, &quot;polla&quot; is vulgarly slang for &quot;cock, penis&quot;. The lyrics of the band harshly criticized fascism, militarism, capitalism, and catholicism. La Polla Records has been very influential in the Spanish-language punk scene.

La Polla Records was a band that was known as a symbol of rebellion against everything, to the point of them being called &quot;anti-everything&quot;. As a result of this they faced several major obstacles throughout their career, primarily threats and repression. The band members even faced jail time during a concert with Eskorbuto, another Basque punk band. In 2019, they announced a comeback and released an album after 16 years off-stage as a band. In 2021 they disbanded again.

==Background==
===1979–1983: Early years===
On 9 December 1979, inspired by the British punk movement, La Polla Records did their first gig at the only pub from Salvatierra, with all the town&#x27;s people at the show, in words of Evaristo: &quot;to see what the fools of the village made&quot;.

In 1981, the band performed and recorded their first demo called &quot;Banco Vaticano&quot;, never released officially. During this time, the band performed some shows in Basque Country and the rest of Spain territories, although the group popularity was low because had yet to embrace punk on the level seen in the UK.

The band recorded their first EP called &quot;¿Y ahora qué?&quot; (&quot;So now what?&quot;) in 1983, it had four songs, under the indie label Oihuka, where managed to draw the attention of producer Marino Goñi.

===1984–1989: First albums and breakthrough success in Spain===
By 1984, La Polla Records began frequently playing large shows, also releasing their first LP &quot;Salve&quot;, to Oihuka label and produced by Marino Goñi. The album was certified Gold, but the group rejected the disc. The following years they recorded &quot;Revolución&quot; (1985), with Abel Murua replacing Maleguin on the bass in this album. That same year played in the Euskal Rock festival at Barcelona, along with Kortatu, RIP and Cicatriz.

In early 1986, La Polla Records played at the San Isidro Festival in Madrid, attended by a big audience. However, riots almost erupted between the police and the fans. La Polla Records began to stage performances on their own, but one of them ended up in an incident in which Txarly was seriously injured, forcing the band to play with just one guitar until early 1988. In 1987, under their own label, Txaca Records, they released &quot;No somos nada&quot;, but did not come in for good reviews. Following this release, La Polla got back to record label Oihuka with &quot;Donde se habla&quot; to critical and public acclaim (1988), boosting their sales again. In 1989 their first live LP album ensued, &quot;En directo&quot;, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 10th Anniversary.

===1990–1994: International tours, new successes and lawsuit===
The 1990s began with a new album: &quot;Ellos dicen mierda, nosotros amén&quot; (&quot;They say shit, we say Amen&quot;) in 1990, which was played in Europe and Latin America for the first time, in Mexico as the only leg. At year-end, released &quot;Los jubilados&quot;, and in 1991 the second EP &quot;Barman&quot;. In 1992, published the seventh album &quot;Negro&quot;, although was roughly divided among the fans, and &quot;Hoy es el futuro&quot; (&quot;Today is the Future&quot;) in 1993, which was better received, and toured by Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.

In 1994 the band was sued by Ángel, a former band sound engineer since 1991, and then a tribunal forbade their use of the name La Polla Records. The band ignored the sentence and released &quot;Bajo presión&quot; under the forbidden name.

===1996–2001: New name, 20th anniversary and &quot;Bocas&quot;===
In 1996, however, they changed their name and simply became La Polla, receiving a new contract with GOR Records. Under this new name released &quot;Carne para la picadora&quot;. A new world tour by Europe and South America, followed a new live album &quot;La Polla en tu recto&quot;, released in 1998 and the last made by GOR label. In 1999, they celebrated their 20th anniversary recording &quot;Toda la puta vida igual&quot;, published by Maldito Records. Shortly after, Txarly left the band in January 2000, due to health problems, replaced by Jokin, a former member of M.C.D. This new line-up released &quot;Bocas&quot; in 2001, with another extended world tour.

===2002–2003: Death of Fernandito, Reformation and Break-up===
In 2002, La Polla were still actively playing when, quite suddenly, Fernandito died of a heart attack on September 3. The band cancelled the remaining concerts of the tour. After the loss of their drummer, Jokin was fired and the vacancy was completed with Txiki and Tripi on guitar and drums respectively. After some shows in 2003, including the Viña Rock, they released their last album: &quot;El último (el) de la Polla&quot; (literally, &quot;La Polla&#x27;s last&quot;) on 3 August of that same year, and with the release of this CD, it was published by the official separation of the group. After the split, Evaristo released a book named &quot;Por los Hijos lo que sea&quot; where he told stories and anecdotes that told many of the same messages as his songs. Then, Evaristo founded Gatillazo in 2005, with Txiki, Tripi (his former band-mates)and Xabi (former RIP bass guitar) and continued performing and recording new material since.

==Legacy==
La Polla Records was one of the first punk bands to sing in Spanish. They, along with dozens of other bands were part of an underground movement that existed throughout the 1980s in Spain, particularly in the Basque Country, quite distinct from the rising bands in Madrid. While the latter put an accent on innovative aesthetics and manners, the Basque brand of alternative rock showed an in-your-face stage attitude and no-holds-barred lyrics, including blunt social and political views. It came as a reaction first to the end of Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship in Spain (1975), and then as an outlet to vent frustration at the limitations of the democratic transition. The brand of DIY rock music developing in the Basque Country during this period came to be known as &quot;Rock Radical Vasco&quot; (Basque Radical Rock). La Polla Records would share this stage with many other influential bands from the Basque Country as Eskorbuto, Kortatu, RIP, Barricada, and many others. The ska-punk band Ska-P cites La Polla Records as one of their primary influences.

<doc id="790623" wikidata="Q1214471" url="?curid=790623" title="The Virginian (TV series)">
<text>The Virginian (later renamed The Men from Shiloh in its final year) is an American Western television series starring James Drury in the title role, along with Doug McClure, Lee J. Cobb, and others. It originally aired on NBC from 1962 to 1971, for a total of 249 episodes. Drury had played the same role in 1958 in an unsuccessful pilot that became an episode of the NBC summer series &quot;Decision&quot;. Filmed in color, &quot;The Virginian&quot; became television&#x27;s first 90-minute Western series (75 minutes excluding commercial breaks). Cobb left the series after four seasons, and was replaced over the years by mature character actors John Dehner, Charles Bickford, John McIntire, and Stewart Granger, all portraying different characters. It was set before Wyoming became a state in 1890, as mentioned several times as Wyoming Territory, although other references set it later, around 1898.

The series was loosely based on &quot;The Virginian: Horseman of the Plains&quot;, a 1902 Western novel by Owen Wister that Hollywood had previously adapted for movies. Percy Faith composed the show&#x27;s original theme.

The series ran for nine seasons, making it network television&#x27;s third-longest running Western series, behind &quot;Bonanza&quot; at 14 seasons and 430 episodes, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; at 20 seasons and 635 episodes.

==Production==
When Revue Productions&#x27; hour long series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; moved from the NBC network to ABC, &quot;The Virginian&quot; was proposed to replace it. From the beginning, the 90-minute series was filmed in Technicolor on 35 mm movie film. The half-hour pilot in 1958 was filmed in black-and-white.

==Synopsis==

===Pilot===
The half-hour black and white pilot titled &quot;The Virginian&quot; aired in 1958 as part of the anthology series &quot;Decision&quot;, which in other weeks aired pilots for six other series.

In the pilot, unlike in the later series, the Virginian had a noticeable Southern accent and wore a belt buckle marked &quot;CSA&quot;, indicating service in the Confederate States Army. The portrayal of him as a young American Civil War veteran would indicate that the time period of the pilot was decades earlier than that of the series. He arrived by invitation at the ranch of Judge Henry (Robert Burton) to be an accountant and manager. He soon becomes involved in unraveling a plot to destroy the judge&#x27;s efforts to create a new town in the surrounding region. Other actors in the pilot, some of whom appeared in the series years later, included Andrew Duggan, Jeanette Nolan, and Dan Blocker (in a small, nonspeaking role).

=== Seasons 1–8 ===

Set in the late 19th century, and loosely based on &quot;The Virginian, A Horseman of the Plains&quot;, a 1902 novel by Owen Wister, the series revolved around the foreman of the Shiloh Ranch, played by Drury. His top hand, Trampas (McClure), was the only character to remain with the show for the entire run, although Ross Elliott, as Sheriff Abbott, recurred throughout the run, appearing in 61 episodes over nine years. As in the book, the foreman went only by the name &quot;the Virginian&quot;. The series was set in Medicine Bow, Wyoming. Various references in the first season indicate that setting is 1898:
* In episode five, &quot;The Brazen Bell&quot;, guest star George C. Scott quotes from Oscar Wilde&#x27;s&quot; The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, which was first published in 1898.
* In episode seven, &quot;Riff Raff&quot;, several of the main characters join Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, the volunteer cavalry unit formed in 1898 to fight in Cuba during the Spanish–American War.
* In episode 11, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Children&quot;, the grave marker for one of the characters who dies in the episode states 1898 as the year of death.
* In episode 13, &quot;The Accomplice&quot;, an 1898 calendar is present in the bunkhouse.

The series focused on the foreman&#x27;s quest to maintain an orderly lifestyle at Shiloh Ranch. The ranch was named after the two-day American Civil War Battle of Shiloh, at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. The show&#x27;s white Appaloosa was named Joe D., and Trampas&#x27; buckskin horse was named Buck.

Several cast changes were made throughout the program&#x27;s run. In the first four seasons (1962–1966), the owner of the ranch was Judge Henry Garth (Cobb). His &quot;de facto&quot; daughter Betsy (Roberta Shore) lived at the ranch with him, and had a sister relationship with the ranch hands. Ranch hand Steve Hill (Gary Clarke) joined in episode storylines. Randy Boone joined the show in the second season as a youthful ranch hand who played guitar and sang duets with Betsy.

In 1965, Decca Records released an LP of songs from the two singing actors. In the episode &quot;First to Thine Own Self&quot; (February 12, 1964), Boone&#x27;s character sings &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, written by Hank Williams in 1949.

In the third season, Clu Gulager, who had previously guest-starred twice in earlier seasons, was added to the show as deputy Emmett Ryker. At the end of season three, executive producer Frank Price was replaced by Norman Macdonnell. Conversely, season four&#x27;s production was strained and troublesome. When Shore left the cast, Macdonnell added a new leading woman—Diane Roter, who played Jennifer, the judge&#x27;s niece. When Cobb left the show in 1966, John Dehner, as Morgan Starr, was brought in as the manager of Shiloh when Judge Garth left to become the governor of Wyoming.

Producer Frank Price returned for season five. The characters of Randy, Morgan Starr, and Jennifer were subsequently replaced with characters of a more familiar tone. John Grainger (played by Charles Bickford) became the new owner. Elizabeth Grainger (played by Sara Lane), was John Grainger&#x27;s granddaughter. Her brother Stacey (Don Quine) rounded out this new cast.

Although Price later left again, the series continued smoothly in the pattern he set. Due to Charles Bickford&#x27;s sudden death in November 1967, season six saw Clay Grainger (John McIntire), take ownership of Shiloh after his brother John&#x27;s apparent departure &quot;on business&quot;. The sixth season also added Holly Grainger (played by Jeanette Nolan, McIntire&#x27;s real-life wife, with whom he often worked professionally) as Clay&#x27;s wife. Season seven had the entrance of David Sutton, played by David Hartman. Sutton was replaced in season eight with a younger hand, Jim Horn (Tim Matheson).

===Season 9===

In season 9 (1970–1971), the name of the program was changed to &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; and the look of the series was completely redesigned. Ownership of the Shiloh Ranch was changed once more, and Colonel Alan MacKenzie (Stewart Granger) took over. Also Lee Majors joined as a new character, Roy Tate, introduced in the fifth episode of the season. Granger said of his character:
They had some idea of Colonel Mackenzie against the West. I wanted no part of that. Englishmen were running cattle here from the beginning. The English have this thing for land; for animals and crops... I said this old cocker&#x27;s out of India and the colonies: he can take the American West on his own terms.
In several countries, including the United Kingdom, the show went under the extended title &quot;The Virginian: Men from Shiloh.&quot;

A new opening theme song was composed by Ennio Morricone, and the look of the show was changed reflecting a style similar to spaghetti Westerns, which were popular at the time.

These changes brought a better ranking (number 18) in the top-30 primetime shows in the United States, after the previous year had the show slip out of the top-30 rankings for the first time. (It was one of only four Western series shown in primetime.)

The final season operated on a &quot;rotating lead actor&quot; basis of the four stars, with normally just one lead appearing each week. Two of the four lead actors (Lee Majors and Doug McClure) never appeared together in the last season. The ranch itself played a very nominal part in season 9, with most scripts featuring the four stars away from the ranch. Little seemingly could save it, as the final season brought in several big guest stars to the remaining episodes. The studio and network were set on ending the series, as evidenced by rivals CBS and ABC making demographic moves away from rural-oriented shows (see &quot;rural purge&quot;). The final episode aired on March 24, 1971, ending the show&#x27;s nine-season run.

==Characters==
===The Virginian===
Played by James Drury, the Virginian was the tough foreman of the Shiloh Ranch. Based loosely on the character in the Owen Wister novel, he always stood his ground firmly. Respected by the town citizens and the hands of the ranch, he was a prominent figure in Medicine Bow. In the series, the Virginian is the ranch foreman from the first episode. This way, the producers were able to establish a feeling that he had been there for a while, thus keeping a consistent story line; this differed from the book, where he was the deputy foreman, eventually promoted to foreman. The Virginian usually wore a black hat, black leather vest, black boots, a maroon red shirt and a single right-handed holster and revolver. He often ordered Monongahela brand whiskey in saloons.

When making the show, the producers chose not to reveal the Virginian&#x27;s real name, and little about his past was actually made known, making the Virginian an intriguing and mysterious character. The foreman worked under five ranch owners throughout the series: Judge Garth (Lee J. Cobb), Morgan Starr (John Dehner), John Grainger (Charles Bickford), Clay Grainger (John McIntire), and Colonel Alan Mackenzie (Stewart Granger). Drury was the only cast member to appear in the pilot (aired as an episode of the series &quot;Decision&quot;) and the entire nine season run of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, with McClure the only other cast member to remain with the show for all nine seasons of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, though not in the initial pilot.

===Judge Garth===
Lee J. Cobb&#x27;s Judge Garth was portrayed as a stern man with a soft side to his personality, acting as a father figure to the Virginian. Respected by all the townspeople as well as his employees, Garth was often looked to as mediator for certain matters. Cobb left the series near the end of season four. In the episode &quot;Morgan Starr&quot;, the character was stated to have left Shiloh to become governor of Wyoming. Garth had previously said he would leave Shiloh to his daughter Betsy in &quot;The Hero&quot; (season three, episode four).

===Trampas===
Played by Doug McClure, the character of Trampas took on a completely different personality from the character in the novel. In Wister&#x27;s book, Trampas was a villain throughout the story and at the end was shot by the Virginian. In the series, producers chose to make Trampas a fun-loving and rowdy character; McClure fit the part perfectly. Trampas, a sandy-haired, rowdy cowhand who eventually settled down on the ranch, was by far the most developed character in the series, as compared to the minimal history on the title character. Several episodes were made detailing his past. McClure added a touch of light comedy to the series to counterbalance the Virginian&#x27;s serious manner. For part of season 9, the Trampas character wore a thick mustache and broader brimmed hat.

===Steve Hill===
Played by Gary Clarke, Steve was a good friend of both Trampas&#x27; and the Virginian&#x27;s. He was constantly getting Trampas in and out of his usual scrapes. The on-screen chemistry that Gary Clarke and Doug McClure possessed reflected a good friendship off screen, and was loved by fans worldwide. Although he was with the show at the beginning, Clarke was being phased out of the show at the end of season two, but remained as a guest star for a few episodes in season three, before departing permanently.

===Betsy Garth===
Played by Roberta Shore from seasons 1–4, Betsy was the only daughter of Judge Garth. Early in the series, she was made clear to be adopted, but nevertheless, the judge treated her as his own. Betsy and the ranch hands had a relationship similar to that of brother and sister. Trampas and Steve had a particular soft spot for her, often jumping to protect her, and looking out for her wellbeing. At the start of the series, Betsy was said to be 15 years old. In a season-four episode, &quot;The Awakening&quot;, she married a minister (Glenn Corbett), and moved to Pennsylvania, reflecting Shore&#x27;s departure from the show.

===Randy Benton===
Played by Randy Boone from seasons 2–4, Randy was a young ranch hand who played guitar and sang. He came into the show as Steve Hill was being phased out as a regular cast member. Before the new Grainger family was brought in for season five, his character was discontinued.

===Deputy Sheriff Emmett Ryker===
At the beginning of season three, a new cast regular was introduced. Clu Gulager played the restless deputy Emmett Ryker. Ryker was the first cast regular not to live on Shiloh. A former lawman turned hired gun, because the pay was better, Ryker decided to settle in Medicine Bow before he took his new profession too far. He was hired by Sheriff Abbott, with whom he had been acquainted, after solving the murder of a prominent rancher in the introductory episode &quot;Ryker&quot;. He became the sheriff in season four. Gulager remained with the show for four seasons, leaving briefly at the beginning of season five, then returning for the rest of season five before leaving for good toward the end of season six.

===Jennifer Sommers===
After Roberta Shore&#x27;s departure, Diane Roter was brought in as the judge&#x27;s niece. At the end of season four, along with Boone and Dehner, she left, making room for the new owners.

===Morgan Starr===
Halfway through season four, Morgan Starr was brought in to run the ranch for Judge Garth because of Garth&#x27;s appointment as governor of Wyoming. John Dehner played a tough and demanding man, who was hard to befriend, as the Virginian and Trampas soon found out. Fans disliked Dehner&#x27;s character, and he left the show at the end of the season.

===John Grainger===
At the beginning of season five, with Judge Garth, Betsy, and Jennifer gone, a new character was brought in to run Shiloh. Charles Bickford played a stern but loving grandfather to his two grandchildren, Stacey and Elizabeth. Although the Virginian and Mr. Grainger never quite had the father–son relationship that the Virginian and Judge Garth had, they got along well. Charles Bickford&#x27;s death on November 9, 1967, was a shock to the cast. He was replaced by John McIntire as his brother Clay.

===Stacey Grainger===
Played by Don Quine, Stacey Grainger, the grandson of John Grainger, lived at Shiloh, beginning in season five. He worked alongside Trampas, and the two become good friends. Stacey&#x27;s sister Elizabeth looked up to him as a big brother, and he filled the role more than competently. Quine&#x27;s two seasons on &quot;The Virginian&quot; were the only ones that finished in the Nielsen rating top-15 year-end rankings.

===Elizabeth Grainger===
Stacey&#x27;s younger sister Elizabeth (Sara Lane) was the granddaughter of John Grainger, starting in season five. Trampas, the Virginian, and Stacey all looked out for her wellbeing. Elizabeth was cast as a teenage girl enjoying her life on the frontier. She loved horses, riding the range, and going to the ever-present Saturday-night dances. Sara Lane departed the series in season eight.

===Clay Grainger===
After the death of Charles Bickford, John McIntire was hired as his brother, Liz and Stacey&#x27;s great uncle. Clay had a wife, Holly (Jeanette Nolan), and was the ranch owner for seasons five through eight. McIntire had earlier taken over the lead role in &quot;Wagon Train&quot; upon the death of Ward Bond, assuming the role of the new wagonmaster. In season 9, &quot;The Virginian&quot; was revamped, and McIntire, along with Nolan, Lane, David Hartman, and Tim Matheson, left the show.

===Legacy===
Drury was an active advocate of the series since the end of the original airings. He traveled across the United States, Ireland, and several other countries, appearing in Western-themed conventions, festivals, celebrations, news programs, and TV specials to promote &quot;The Virginian.&quot; Along with Gary Clarke and Roberta Shore, he participated in interviews for the Encore Westerns channel. Drury also reunited with key cast members Randy Boone, Gary Clarke, and Roberta Shore at these events.
In 2012, Drury also reunited with L. Q. Jones, Clu Gulager, Diane Roter, Sara Lane, and Don Quine in addition to Boone, Clarke, and Shore. Three events were held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, at the Memphis Film Festival on May 31, 2012, the Western Legends Roundup on August 16, 2012, and the Autry National Center and Museum on September 22, 2012. During the 50th-anniversary event, INSP, the exclusive cable home to current reruns of &quot;The Virginian&quot; filmed content with the surviving cast to use in the &quot;Cast Favorites Marathon&quot;, which continues to be aired several times each year. In 2017, INSP began airing &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; during their Saddle Up Weekends programming block.

<doc id="790670" wikidata="Q265592" url="?curid=790670" title="Space Mutiny">
<text>Space Mutiny is a 1988 South African/American space opera science fiction film whose credited director is David Winters and replaced by Neal Sundstrom during production. Produced by Hope Holiday and shot in South Africa, it stars Reb Brown, Cisse Cameron, Cameron Mitchell, James Ryan, and John Phillip Law.

The film is about a mutiny aboard the generation ship known as the &quot;Southern Sun&quot; which is stopped with the aid of a visiting pilot, the protagonist.

Upon the first shooting day, it was announced to director David Winters that his father had died. Being emotionally troubled and with a funeral to attend, Winters was unable to perform his duties and passed it on to his assistant director Neal Sundstorm. However, he was informed that the investors had agreed to the film only if Winters was its director, and could face litigation if he withdrew, hence his credit. After its release, Winters disowned the film.

The film has the reputation of being an amusing, unintentionally funny, and campy B-movie. It was later included in an episode of the TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

== Plot ==
The &quot;Southern Sun&quot; is a generation ship, a spacefaring vessel that contains a large number of people, whose mission is to colonize a new world. Its voyage from its original homeworld (implied to be Earth) has lasted thirteen generations, so many of its inhabitants have been born and will die without ever setting foot on solid ground. This does not please the antagonist, Elijah Kalgan (John Phillip Law), who conspires with the pirates infesting the nearby Corona Borealis system and the ship&#x27;s Chief Engineer MacPhearson (James Ryan). Kalgan hatches a plot to disrupt the Southern Sun&#x27;s navigation systems and use the Enforcers, the ship&#x27;s police force, to hijack the ship and direct it towards this system. At this point, the inhabitants of the &quot;Southern Sun&quot; will have no choice but to accept his &quot;generosity&quot;.

Kalgan sabotages a key part of the ship just as a small craft with an important professor aboard is on a landing trajectory. The loss of guidance control causes the craft to crash and explode. The pilot, Dave Ryder (Reb Brown), is able to escape, but the professor dies in the explosion. This sabotage seals off the flight deck for a number of weeks, which gives Kalgan the opportunity to attempt to wrest control. With the Enforcers in his hand, and with the flight deck out of commission, he holds the entire population of the &quot;Southern Sun&quot; hostage. Commander Jansen (Cameron Mitchell) and Captain Devers enlist Ryder&#x27;s assistance, aided begrudgingly by Jansen&#x27;s daughter Dr. Lea Jansen (Cisse Cameron), to regain control of the ship.

== Production ==
According to credited director David Winters, the casting of Reb Brown as the lead was due to the positive reviews he received for a previous film. While being offered the role, Brown asked Winters if he could hire his wife Cisse Cameron, for which he accepted. John Phillip Law was hired because of his credentials and to add extra marquee value. James Ryan and Cameron Mitchell were hired because they had good working relationships with Winters.

Winters explained that on the first day of production, he received a call that his father died. Upon receiving the news, he passed on the directorial duties to his assistant director Neal Sundstrom, and took the first plane from its filming location in South Africa back to the United States.

The funeral took a lot of energy from him, was emotionally distraught, and when it was done he decided to stay in the US to comfort his grieving mother.

Eventually, the law firm in charge of the production contacted him to explain that on the contract with the investors, it was agreed that they would get a film directed by David Winters, and could sue if not delivered as such. Not feeling up to the task, Winters with producer Hope Holiday decided that he could stay in a hotel in Johannesburg for the remainder of the shoot and if any investors showed up he could go to set.

Ever since Winters has disowned the film.

==Reception==
Danny Reagan, in his review published in the &quot;Abilene Reporter-News&quot;, found it enjoyable and said it &quot;is strictly B-grade sci-fi movie fare, but pretty good B-stuff. And B&#x27;s usually are made for family viewing, as is this one&quot;.

Mike Mayo wrote in &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; that the film was comical and &quot;high level camp&quot;. He graded it two stars and a half out of five. He recommended it &quot;for fans of alternative video&quot;, saying &quot;this one is a treat&quot;.

In his review published in &quot;The Times&quot;, Tom Lounges gave it three out of five stars. While he thought the dialogue wasn&#x27;t very good, he said that the &quot;film is never at loss for action and special-effect sequences&quot;. He found John Phillip Law&#x27;s performance too campy, but liked the ones from James Ryan, Reb Brown, and Cameron Mitchell.

A &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer who goes by the pseudonym &quot;Lor&quot; declared the film to be &quot;an okay space saga&quot;, noting that &quot;Cute model shots provide a patina of space opera section though the special effects are decidedly chintzy.&quot;

The movie-mocking television comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; lampooned it. Writer Bill Corbett recalled &quot;one of the movies that stood out for me was &quot;Space Mutiny.&quot; It was a South African film that was really fun and really dumb and gave us the gift of having a character killed off pointedly one moment and then, five minutes later, sitting back at her desk&quot;. Kayleigh Hearn of &quot;Looper.com&quot; said it&#x27;s the second best episode of the show, adding that, &quot;action-packed and incredibly quotable, &quot;Space Mutiny&quot; is a perfect entry point for viewers new to &quot;MST3K&quot;.&quot;

== &quot;Saga of a Fugitive Fleet&quot; audio drama adaptation ==

In 2020, the plot of &quot;Space Mutiny&quot; was adapted for an audio drama, &quot;Saga of a Fugitive Fleet&quot;, that served as an unofficial continuation of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series. In the revamped &quot;Space Mutiny&quot; plot, Kalgan is the head of Fleet Security and stages a mutiny designed to divert the fleet from its search for the planet Earth, among other plot points. Original cast members Terry Carter, Noah Hathaway, Anne Lockhart, Sarah Rush and Laurette Spang participated.

<text>Nicholas deBelleville Katzenbach (January 17, 1922 – May 8, 2012) was an American lawyer who served as United States Attorney General during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. He had previously served as United States Deputy Attorney General under President John F. Kennedy.

==Early life and education==
Katzenbach was born in Philadelphia and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. His parents were Edward L. Katzenbach, who served as Attorney General of New Jersey, and Marie Hilson Katzenbach, who was the first female president of the New Jersey State Board of Education. His uncle, Frank S. Katzenbach, served as Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey and as a Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.

He was named after his mother&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Nicolas de Belleville (1753–1831), a French medical doctor who accompanied Kazimierz Pułaski to America and settled in Trenton in 1778. Katzenbach was raised an Episcopalian, and was partly of German descent.

He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and was accepted into Princeton University. Katzenbach was a junior at Princeton in 1941 who enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces right after Pearl Harbor and served in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. He was assigned as a navigator in the 381st Bomb Squadron, 310th Bomb Group in North Africa. His B-25 Mitchell Bomber was shot down February 23, 1943, over the Mediterranean Sea off North Africa. He spent over two years as a prisoner of war in Italian and German POW camps, including Stalag Luft III, the site of the &quot;Great Escape&quot;, in which Katzenbach assisted. He read extensively as a prisoner and ran an informal class based on &quot;Principles of Common Law&quot;.

He received his A.B., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Princeton University in 1945 (partly based on Princeton giving him credit for the 500-odd books he had read in captivity). As part of his degree, Katzenbach completed a senior thesis titled &quot;The Little Steel Formula: An Historical Appraisal.&quot; He received an LL.B., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Yale Law School in 1947, where he served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. From 1947 to 1949, he was a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford.

On June 8, 1946, Katzenbach married Lydia King Phelps Stokes, in a ceremony officiated by her uncle, Anson Phelps Stokes, former canon of the Washington National Cathedral. Her father was Harold Phelps Stokes, a newspaper correspondent and secretary to Herbert Hoover.

Katzenbach was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1950 and the Connecticut bar in 1955. He was an associate in the law firm of Katzenbach, Gildea and Rudner in 1950.

==Government service==
From 1950 to 1952, he was attorney-advisor in the Office of General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force. Katzenbach was on the faculty of Rutgers Law School from 1950 to 1951; was an associate professor of law at Yale from 1952 to 1956; and was a professor of law at the University of Chicago from 1956 to 1960.

He served in the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel in 1961–1962 and as Deputy Attorney General appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. After the assassination of President Kennedy, Katzenbach continued to serve with the Johnson administration. On February 11, 1965 President Johnson appointed Katzenbach the 65th Attorney General of the United States, and he held the office until October 2, 1966. He then served as Under Secretary of State from 1966 to 1969. While Under Secretary of State, he commented on the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident: “There was nobody I think who did not believe that the Israelis knew it was an American ship that they were attacking.”

In September 2008, Katzenbach published &quot;Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ&quot; (W. W. Norton), a memoir of his years in Government service.

==The &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot;==

On June 11, 1963, Katzenbach was a primary participant in one of the most famous incidents of the Civil Rights struggle. Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in front of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama in an attempt to stop desegregation of that institution by the enrollment of two black students, Vivian Malone and James Hood. This became known as the &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot;. Hours later, Wallace stood aside only after being ordered to do so by Alabama National Guard General Henry V. Graham.

==Role in JFK assassination investigation==
Katzenbach has been credited with providing advice after the assassination of John F. Kennedy that led to the creation of the Warren Commission. On November 25, 1963, he sent a memo to Johnson&#x27;s White House aide Bill Moyers recommending the creation of a Presidential Commission to investigate the assassination. To combat speculation of a conspiracy, Katzenbach said the results of the FBI&#x27;s investigation should be made public. He wrote, in part: &quot;The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large&quot;.

Four days after Katzenbach&#x27;s memo, Johnson appointed some of the nation&#x27;s most prominent figures, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to the Commission. Conspiracy theorists later called the memo, one of thousands of files released by the National Archives in 1994, the first sign of a cover-up by the government.

==Later years==
Katzenbach left government service to work for IBM in 1969, where he served as general counsel during the lengthy antitrust case filed by the Department of Justice seeking the break-up of IBM. He and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore attorney Thomas Barr led the case for the computer giant for 13 years until the government finally decided to drop it in 1982. Later Katzenbach led the opposition against the case filed by the European Economic Community.

He retired from IBM in 1986 and became a partner at the firm of Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland &amp; Perretti in New Jersey. He was named chairman of the failing Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991.

In 1980, Katzenbach testified in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for the defense of W. Mark Felt, later revealed to be the &quot;Deep Throat&quot; of the Watergate scandal and later Deputy Director of the FBI; accused and later found guilty of ordering illegal wiretaps on American citizens.

In December 1996, Katzenbach was one of New Jersey&#x27;s fifteen members of the Electoral College, who cast their votes for the Clinton/Gore ticket.

Katzenbach also testified on behalf of President Clinton on December 8, 1998, before the House Judiciary Committee hearing, considering whether to impeach President Clinton.

In July 2002, Katzenbach joined the board of MCI Communications. In March 2004, he was elected as non-executive chairman of the MCI&#x27;s board, effective after MCI emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MCI later merged with Verizon.

Katzenbach was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Katzenbach and his wife Lydia retired to the Princeton, New Jersey area, with a summer home in West Tisbury, Massachusetts on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. His son is writer John Katzenbach. His daughter, Maria, is also a published novelist.

After the death of W. Willard Wirtz in April 2010, Katzenbach became the oldest surviving former U.S. Cabinet member. Katzenbach died at his home in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey, on May 8, 2012, at the age of 90.

<text>Harry Kim (born 1939) is an American politician who was the mayor of Hawaii County, from 2000 to 2008 and 2016 to 2020. Before serving as mayor, he was the county&#x27;s civil defense director.

==Early life==
Kim was born to Korean-American immigrants, the youngest of eight children. He was raised in ‘Ola‘a in what was then the Territory of Hawaii (now Keaau, Hawaii). They resided in a one-bedroom house with no electricity or running water. He and his siblings would often work for the family business and perform other chores to the point where he was surprised when he learned of a typical weekend.

He attended Ola&#x27;a School and Hilo High School. He then attended the University of Hawaii at Hilo and graduated from Southern Oregon State University. He served in the United States Army as a medic and was a teacher and coach. Kim served for 16 years as County Director of Civil Defense. As Director, Kim would go on the radio and would update the residents of Hawai&#x27;i.

==First tenure as Mayor==
Kim announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for mayor in 2000. After defeating Democrat turned Republican State Representative Harvey Tajiri in the primary Kim won the general election with 50% of the vote. His opponents, Democratic candidate Fred Holschuh and Green Party candidate Keiko Bonk received 30 and 20 percent, respectively.

In 2004, Kim ran for a second term, easily winning reelection.

While Kim first ran for mayor as a Republican, he considers himself nonpartisan. Until he ran for mayor, his only visible political activity had been backing Democratic mayor Lorraine Inouye. In 2006, prominent Democrats including former Governor Ben Cayetano, then-U.S. Representatives Neil Abercrombie and party chairman Mike McCartney encouraged Kim to run for governor against Linda Lingle. On July 22, 2006, shortly before the filing deadline, he removed his name from consideration.

During his first eight years in office, Kim advocated, among other initiatives, recycling projects and the creation of a new County office complex in the place of the defunct Kaikoo Mall.

==Hawaii mayoral election, 2012==
In 2012, Kim ran for mayor once more against his successor, Billy Kenoi. Kim lost by 1,438 votes, earning 49% to Kenoi&#x27;s 51%.

==Return to the Mayor&#x27;s office==
In the wake of Kenoi&#x27;s alleged misuse of a purchasing card issued by Hawaii County, Kim said on Thursday, March 3, 2016, that he had decided to run again, this time on a campaign to restore trust in government. He was elected mayor in primary voting on August 13, 2016, when he received more than 50% of the votes cast in a field of 13 candidates, thereby avoiding a runoff election in November. In keeping with a commitment he had made in every campaign to accept no more than a $10 donation from any individual, Kim spent a total of $21,931 in 2016, for a per-vote cost of $1.06. His nearest competitor spent $220,289, for a per-vote cost of $22.11.
Kim lost his race for a fourth term as mayor in August, 2020, and his term ended in early December. Former Hawaii County Prosecutor Mitch Roth defeated Ikaika Marzo to succeed Kim as County Mayor.

On June 5, 2018, Hawaii County officials confirmed that a home Kim owned in Vacationland Hawaii was claimed by the lava flow from the 2018 lower Puna eruption of Kīlauea.

<text>Lee Patterson (March 31, 1929 – February 14, 2007) was a Canadian film and television actor.

== British career ==
He moved to the UK, where he specialised in playing virile American types in British films. He appeared in a number of films during the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;The Good Die Young&quot; (1954), &quot;Above Us the Waves&quot; (1955), &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), &quot;The Key Man&quot; (1957), &quot;Time Lock&quot; (1957) &quot;The Golden Disc&quot; (1958), 
&quot;Cat &amp; Mouse&quot; (1958), &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1959) and &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot; (1960). He left but returned to the UK to appear as hard-bitten navigation expert Captain Randolph Southard in the play version of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot; at The Queen&#x27;s Theatre, London, directed by Charlton Heston in 1985.

== American TV ==
After moving to the USA in the early 1960s, Patterson worked mainly in television. In 1960, he was cast in two episodes of the ABC/Warner Brothers western television series &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, starring Roger Moore. Patterson played Tom Kirk in the episode &quot;Behind the Moon&quot; and Jeff Warren in &quot;Sign of the Kodiak&quot;, a reference to the Kodiak bear. Later that year, he was cast as the fictional detective Dave Thorne in another ABC/WB series, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, set on a houseboat anchored at Miami Beach, Florida, which co-starred Van Williams, Troy Donahue, Diane McBain and Margarita Sierra.

He also appeared in 1965 on the fourth season of &quot;Combat!&quot; as an O.S.S Officer, Captain Howard in the episode &quot;9 Place Vendee&quot;.

Early in 1966, Patterson appeared as Dan Thorne in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Midnight Howler&quot;.

== Later career ==
Patterson appeared in daytime serials prior to 1970. His first soap opera role was that of Brad Kiernan in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Nurses&quot;. After that show was cancelled in 1967, he joined the original cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, a move that reunited him with Doris Quinlan, the producer of &quot;The Nurses&quot;.

Patterson remained in &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until 1970, when his character Joe Riley was presumed dead; he returned to the show in 1972 and remained the romantic lead until 1979, when he left due to his unhappiness with the direction the show took after Doris Quinlan left to produce NBC&#x27;s troubled serial &quot;The Doctors&quot;. 

Patterson then joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; in the role of Dr. Kevin Cooke. The character began in &quot;Another World&quot;, but moved to &quot;Texas&quot; when that show began on August 4, 1980. He stayed until 1981, when the show was revamped to bring up its poor ratings against the number-one daytime program, ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;. &quot;Texas&quot; was cancelled in 1982. Patterson returned to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Joe&#x27;s twin brother, Tom Dennison, from 1986 until 1988.

He also continued to make appearances in other television shows such as &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;, and appeared in movies including &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (1972) and &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982). His last role was as Sergeant Gaylor in the 1994 film &quot;Healer&quot;.

== Death ==
Patterson died in Galveston, Texas, of congestive heart failure with complications from lung cancer and emphysema, on 14 February 2007; he was aged 77. His death was not reported for nearly a year.

<text>On March 2, 2004, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in the 2004 Presidential Election. Kerry selected North Carolina Senator John Edwards as his running mate on July 6, 2004. The Kerry–Edwards ticket was ultimately defeated by the Bush–Cheney ticket in the general election, and Edwards returned to the Senate following the campaign but left politics less than two months later.

==Selection Process==
The vice presidential selection process was led by James Johnson, former chief executive officer of Fannie Mae and Chairman of Walter Mondale&#x27;s 1984 Presidential Campaign. Kerry, who had been considered by Al Gore in 2000 as a potential running mate, sought to ensure that the selection process was discreet. To evade reporters, Kerry interviewed Edwards at former Secretary of State Madeline Albright&#x27;s home in Washington D.C. Alyssa Mastromonaco, who would later serve as White House Deputy Chief of Staff under President Barack Obama, organized Kerry&#x27;s meetings with the candidates.

=== Reported Shortlist ===
Pundits and those close to the Kerry campaign indicated that candidates narrowed to five potential choices.

== Announcement ==
The night before the campaign&#x27;s announcement of the selection of Edwards, the information was leaked by an airport worker who saw Edwards&#x27;s name being painted on Kerry&#x27;s plane. On July 6, the Kerry campaign sent an e-mail message to his supporters at about 8:15 a.m. EDT informing them of the choice, and made the formal announcement at 9 a.m. EDT in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

<text>Free response questions, FRQ or essay questions are a type of open-ended question commonly used in schools to test students&#x27; &quot;learning&quot;, as well as in entrance exams and sometimes as part of job application or screening processes.

==Description==
Free response questions require test takers to respond to a question or open-ended prompt with a prose response. In addition to being graded for factual correctness, free response questions may also be graded for persuasiveness, style, and demonstrated mastery of the subject material. Free response questions are a common part of assessment tests in schools, as well as being part of standardized tests Essay questions are also sometimes included as part of a job interview or a school application process.

Free response questions typically require little work for instructors to write, but can be difficult to grade consistently as they require subjective judgments. Free response tests are a relatively effective test of higher-level reasoning, as the format requires test-takers to provide more of their reasoning in the answer than multiple choice questions. Students, however, report higher levels of anxiety when taking essay questions as compared to short-response or multiple choice exams.

<text>William Gamble (1 January 1818 – 20 December 1866) was a civil engineer and a United States Army cavalry officer. He served during the Second Seminole War, and fought for the Union during the American Civil War. He commanded one of two brigades in Brigadier General John Buford&#x27;s Division of Cavalry, in which he played an important role in defending Union positions during the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg.

==Early life==
Gamble was born in the townland of Duross, Lisnarick, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He studied civil engineering, worked in the Queen&#x27;s Surveying Office, and participated in the Ordnance Survey Ireland. He emigrated to the United States in 1838. Since he had experience as a dragoon in the British army, he enlisted as a private in the 1st U.S. Dragoons and rose through the ranks to become sergeant major by 1839. While in the Army he married Sophia Steingrandt, daughter of King&#x27;s German Legion Feldwebel Georg Steingrandt, on 6 May 1841, and they had 13 (by some accounts 15) children together. After fighting in the Seminole Wars, he was discharged in 1843 and worked as a civil engineer for the Board of Public Works in Chicago and lived in Evanston, Illinois. His house is now used by the Anthropology Department of Northwestern University.

==Civil War==
After the start of the Civil War, Gamble was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 8th Illinois Cavalry regiment on 18 September 1861. His nomination was urged by his close friend, U.S. Congressman John F. Farnsworth, who raised and commanded the regiment. Gamble&#x27;s son George also joined the regiment as a first lieutenant. (George survived the war, but was killed in a collapsed hotel during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake).

Gamble&#x27;s regiment was attached to the Pennsylvania Reserve Division and fought in the Peninsula Campaign during the spring and summer of 1862. On August 5, 1862 - more than a month after the end of the Seven Days Battles - Gamble was badly wounded when he was shot in the chest while leading a cavalry charge against rebel pickets near Malvern Hill. 

Gamble spent the fall of 1862 recovering from his wound, and when Farnsworth was promoted to brigadier general, Gamble was promoted to colonel on 5 December 1862, and was given command of the 8th Illinois Cavalry. His regiment saw no action in the Battle of Fredericksburg. 

In early 1863, Gamble was promoted to command of the 1st Brigade of Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton&#x27;s cavalry division in the Army of the Potomac, but suffering from rheumatism and neuralgia (possibly as a result of his wound the year before or the severity of the winter), he received a medical furlough in March 1863, and was absent for the Battle of Chancellorsville, as well as for the largest cavalry battle of the war in the Battle of Brandy Station. The officer in temporary command of his brigade, Colonel Benjamin Franklin Davis, was killed there, and Gamble returned to the field on 13 June 1863.

During the Gettysburg Campaign, Gamble&#x27;s brigade was assigned to Brig. Gen. John Buford&#x27;s 1st Division. He reached Gettysburg on 30 June and was riding at the head of the column when they spotted the first elements of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and began the Battle of Gettysburg on the morning of 1 July. While his troops were hopelessly outnumbered, they slowed the progress of the Mississippi brigades from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill&#x27;s corps for about two hours while Union infantry from Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds&#x27;s I Corps (James S. Wadsworth&#x27;s division) hurried to join the fight. When it came time to retire, Colonel Gamble&#x27;s troops moved to the infantry&#x27;s left flank. Gamble, along with the rest of Buford&#x27;s cavalry, had provided a crucial window of time to get the Union Army into position.

After Gettysburg, the theatre of war shifted back to Virginia. During this time, Gamble briefly joined George Stoneman&#x27;s staff at the U.S. Cavalry Bureau in Washington, D.C.. Colonel George Henry Chapman replaced him as commander of the brigade, which remained with the main army and fought in the ensuing Bristoe Campaign and Mine Run Campaign.

From December 21, 1863, until the end of the war, Gamble commanded a cavalry division in the XXII Corps of the Department of Washington, where was involved in the defense of the city, particularly at the Battle of Fort Stevens, and thereafter his troopers continuously tangled with the Confederate partisan ranger, John S. Mosby. He commanded the remount station at Camp Stoneman, but the lingering effects of his wounds prevented any further field service. Gamble received a brevet promotion to brigadier general on 12 December 1864, and a full promotion to brigadier general on 25 September 1865. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on 13 March 1866, and reentered the service with the rank of major in the 8th U.S. Cavalry.

==Postbellum life==
Gamble died of cholera in Virgin Bay, Nicaragua, while en route to command of the Presidio of San Francisco, and is buried in Virgin Bay in the Virgin Grove Cemetery, a burial ground which has been flooded and obliterated by the waters of the Bay.

==In popular media==
Gamble was portrayed by Buck Taylor in the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, based on Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. He appears in the alternate history novel &quot;&quot;, in which he is taken as a prisoner of war.

<text>The Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) is a political party in Lesotho.

In 1997, Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle left the Basutoland Congress Party to form with his faction the new Lesotho Congress for Democracy. The new party won the 1998 elections with 60.7% of the popular vote and 79 out of 80 seats. Pakalitha Mosisili became the new party leader and prime minister. At the elections for the National Assembly, 25 May 2002, the party won 54.9% of popular votes and 77 out of 120 seats. In the 17 February 2007 parliamentary election, the party won 62 out of 120 seats.

Major splits from the party occurred in October 2001, when leading LCD members Kelebone Maope and Shakhane Mokhehle left the party to form the Lesotho People&#x27;s Congress and in October 2006, when Tom Thabane left the party to form the All Basotho Convention. Prior to the Lesotho general election, 2012 the party split again with incumbent Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili forming the Democratic Congress and General Secretary Mothetjoa Metsing taking over the party leadership.

<text>Robert William Burchfield CNZM, CBE (27 January 1923 – 5 July 2004) was a lexicographer, scholar, and writer, who edited the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; for thirty years to 1986, and was chief editor from 1971.

==Education and career==
Born in Whanganui, New Zealand, he studied at Wanganui Technical College and Victoria University in Wellington. After war service in the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery, he graduated MA from Wellington in 1948 and won a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford University, in England, where he was tutored by C. S. Lewis. He became a Fellow of Magdalen and lecturer in English straight after graduating (1952–53), subsequently moving colleges to Christ Church (1953–57) and St Peter&#x27;s (1955–79). Through C. T. Onions, the Magdalen librarian, Burchfield assisted in editing one of Onions&#x27;s projects, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology&quot;. His preparation of an edition of the &quot;Ormulum&quot; was supervised by J. R. R. Tolkien.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED/Independent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; website entry for Robert Burchfield, including &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Onions recommended him to Dan Davin as editor of the second &quot;Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, on which he worked from 1957 to 1986. He re-established the network of volunteer readers sending in records of words that had helped to create the original OED but had been allowed to fall away. In 2004, it emerged that Burchfield&#x27;s second supplement had removed a large number of words that were present in the earlier 1933 supplement edited by Onions and William Craigie, which Burchfield&#x27;s second supplement incorporated. Four years later the full nature of his treatment of foreign words was shown: he deleted 17 per cent of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English; and his coverage was not as extensive as his predecessors, especially Onions, who included 45 per cent more loanwords and World Englishes. In 2012, a book documented Burchfield&#x27;s work and showed that many of the omitted words had only a single recorded usage, but their removal ran against both what was thought to be the established OED editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to &quot;World English&quot;. The author of the book concerned, Sarah Ogilvie, complained that people were unfairly judging Burchfield and that her coverage had been misleadingly reported in the media.

Burchfield also participated in a 1980s BBC committee that monitored compliance with the broadcaster&#x27;s policy of using received pronunciation in newscasting, before that policy was abandoned in 1989 in favor of &quot;using announcers and newsreaders with a more representative range of accents.&quot;

In 1994 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Burchfield its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work.

In retirement, he produced a controversial new edition, substantially rewritten and less prescriptivist, of &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, the long-established style guide by Henry Watson Fowler.

He lived for many years in Sutton Courtenay, and died in Abingdon-on-Thames at 81, in 2004. He married twice and had three children.

<doc id="790752" wikidata="Q3474126" url="?curid=790752" title="Sauce Robert">
<text>Sauce Robert () is a brown mustard sauce and one of the &quot;small sauces&quot;, or compound sauces, derived from the classic French demi-glace, which in turn is derived from espagnole sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French cuisine (béchamel, velouté, espagnole, sauce tomate, and hollandaise).

Sauce Robert is made from chopped onions cooked in butter without color, a reduction of white wine, pepper, an addition of demi-glace and is finished with mustard.

It is suited to red meat, specifically pork, typically grilled pork.

== History ==
Sauce Robert is one of the earliest compound sauces on record. Of the 78 compound sauces systematized by Marie-Antoine Carême in the early 19th century, only two—sauce Robert and remoulade—were present in much older cookbooks, such as François Massialot&#x27;s &quot;Le Cuisinier Roial et Bourgeois&quot;, from 1691. In Charles Perrault&#x27;s canonical telling of Sleeping Beauty (1696), the ogress Queen Mother insists that Sleeping Beauty and her children be served to her à la sauce Robert.

A version of sauce Robert also appears in Francois-Pierre de la Varenne&#x27;s &quot;Le Cuisinier François&quot; (1651), the founding text of modern French cuisine.

<doc id="790772" wikidata="Q478016" url="?curid=790772" title="To the Lighthouse">
<text>To the Lighthouse is a 1927 novel by Virginia Woolf. The novel centres on the Ramsay family and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between 1910 and 1920.

Following and extending the tradition of modernist novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, the plot of &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is secondary to its philosophical introspection. Cited as a key example of the literary technique of multiple focalisation, the novel includes little dialogue and almost no direct action; most of it is written as thoughts and observations. &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is made of three powerfully charged visions into the life of the Ramsay family—maternal Mrs. Ramsay, highbrow Mr. Ramsay, and their eight children—who live in a summer house off the rocky coast of Scotland. From Mr. Ramsay&#x27;s seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Virginia Woolf examines tensions and allegiances and shows that the small joys and quiet tragedies of everyday life could go on forever. The novel recalls childhood emotions and highlights adult relationships. Among the book&#x27;s many tropes and themes are those of loss, subjectivity, the nature of art, and the problem of perception.

In 1998, the Modern Library named &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; No. 15 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2005, the novel was chosen by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels since 1923.

==Plot summary==

===Part I: The Window===
The novel is set in the Ramsays&#x27; summer home in the Hebrides, on the Isle of Skye. The section begins with Mrs Ramsay assuring her 6-year-old son James that they should be able to visit the lighthouse the next day. This prediction is countered by Mr Ramsay, who voices his certainty that the weather will not be clear. This opinion forces a certain tension between Mr and Mrs Ramsay, and also between Mr Ramsay and James. This particular incident is referred to on various occasions throughout the section, especially in the context of Mr and Mrs Ramsay&#x27;s relationship.

The Ramsays and their eight children are joined at the house by several friends and colleagues. One of these friends, Lily Briscoe, begins the novel as a young, uncertain painter attempting a portrait of Mrs Ramsay and James. Briscoe finds herself plagued by doubts throughout the novel, largely fed by the claims of Charles Tansley, another guest, who asserts that women can neither paint nor write. Tansley himself is an admirer of Mr Ramsay, a philosophy professor, and of Ramsay&#x27;s academic treatises.

The section closes with a large dinner party. When Augustus Carmichael, a visiting poet, asks for a second serving of soup Mr Ramsay nearly snaps at him. Mrs Ramsay is out of sorts when Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle, two acquaintances whom she has brought together in engagement, arrive late to dinner, as Minta has lost her grandmother&#x27;s brooch on the beach.

===Part II: Time Passes===
This second section gives a sense of time passing, absence and death. Ten years pass, during which the First World War begins and ends. Mrs Ramsay dies, as do two of her childrenPrue dies from complications of childbirth and Andrew is killed in the war. Mr Ramsay is left adrift without his wife to praise and comfort him during his bouts of fear and anguish regarding the longevity of his philosophical work. This section is told from an omniscient point of view and occasionally from Mrs McNab&#x27;s point of view. Mrs McNab worked in the Ramsays&#x27; house from the beginning and provides a view of how things have changed while the summer home has been unoccupied.

===Part III: The Lighthouse===
In this final section, some of the remaining Ramsays and other guests return to their summer home ten years after the events of Part I. Mr Ramsay plans to make the long-delayed visit to the lighthouse with his daughter Cam(illa) and his son James (his other four surviving children are virtually unmentioned in the final section). The visit almost does not happen, as Cam and James are not ready, but they eventually set off. As they travel the children are silent in protest at their father for forcing them to come along. However, James keeps the sailing boat steady, and rather than receiving the harsh words he has come to expect from his father, he hears praise, providing a rare moment of empathy between father and son. Cam&#x27;s attitude towards her father changes from resentment to eventual admiration.

They are accompanied by the sailor Macalister and his son, who catches fish during the journey.

While they set sail for the lighthouse, Lily attempts to complete the painting she has held in her mind since the start of the novel. She reconsiders her memories of Mrs and Mr Ramsay, balancing the multitude of impressions from ten years ago in an effort to reach the objective truth about Mrs Ramsay and about life itself. Upon finishing the painting just as the sailing party reaches the lighthouse, and seeing that it satisfies her, she realises that the execution of her vision is more important to her than the idea of leaving some sort of legacy.

==Major themes==

=== The Passage of Time ===
One theme often pondered and expressed as a main theme in ‘To the Lighthouse’ is the passage of time and memory as it correlates to everyday life, and then the ‘big picture’. As Ramsay&#x27;s time at the Isle of Skye represents a pause in time away from their ordinary motions of life, Woolf uses her complex characters to reflect on the movement of time. The character of Mrs.Ramsay in particular is very aware of how fast time moves, and works to slow down time by preserving her children&#x27;s youth, and keeping the family in a protective bubble. In ‘Time Passes’, the second section of the novel, the family is now left with the loss and absence of Mrs.Ramsay after her passing. The rest of the novel is then reflective of how the vacation house and its memories within it act as a portal keeping life from moving forward. The artist Lily can’t find inspiration to paint with the absence of Mrs.Ramsay, as Ramsay had said “life stands still here.”, and there is no inspiration in a stuck moment in time – only reflection. Getting to the lighthouse for the rest of the Ramsay family explores an instance of recovery for the family as they move forward.

=== A Victorian Gendered Analysis ===
As the character of Mr. Ramsay compares his own complexity of self to that of a piano or the arrangement of the alphabet, Woolf is giving her audience an insight into the nature of how the man, or in this case how Woolf perceives the intellectual head of the Victorian household, is seen within his own mind. Woolf uses this character trait of a man like Mr. Ramsay to show the inner-workings of a family dynamic, with the man being the outwardly respected figure, while being the inwardly resented character (primarily by his children and himself). Mrs. Ramsay in this dynamic is the maternal and perfect figure the family relies on. The children need her protection from the truth of the world, and her husband needs her nurturement to succeed and boost his ego. As a picture of the Victorian era ideology, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay act as the blueprint.  With the addition of young character Lily Briscoe presenting the then new age ‘modern woman’, Mr. Ramsay is left with a unsatisfied lack of validation after their conversation on the beach in Part III. Instead of performing the task of encouraging and uplifting Mr.Ramsay – as expected of the Victorian woman – Lilly turns a blind eye to Mr. Ramsay’s search for sympathy. Woolf often is seen exploring the binary between both man and woman, and generational gendered differences in her novels.

===Complexity of experience===
Large parts of Woolf&#x27;s novel do not concern themselves with the objects of vision, but rather investigate the means of perception, attempting to understand people in the act of looking. To be able to understand thought, Woolf&#x27;s diaries reveal, that the author would spend considerable time listening to herself think, observing how and which words and emotions arose in her mind in response to what she saw.

===Complexity of human relationships===
This examination of perception is not, however, limited to isolated inner dialogues, but also analysed in the context of human relationships and the tumultuous emotional spaces crossed to truly reach another human being. Two sections of the book stand out as excellent snapshots of fumbling attempts at this crossing: the silent interchange between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay as they pass the time alone together at the end of section 1, and Lily Briscoe&#x27;s struggle to fulfill Mr. Ramsay&#x27;s desire for sympathy (and attention) as the novel closes.

==Narration and perspective==
The novel maintains an unusual form of omniscient narrator; the plot unfolds through shifting perspectives of each character&#x27;s consciousness. Shifts can occur even mid-sentence, and in some sense, they resemble the rotating beam of the lighthouse itself. Unlike James Joyce&#x27;s stream of consciousness technique, however, Woolf does not tend to use abrupt fragments to represent characters&#x27; thought processes; her method is more one of lyrical paraphrases. The unique presentation of omniscient narration means that, throughout the novel, readers are challenged to formulate their own understanding, and views, from the subtle shifts in character development, as much of the story is presented in ambiguous, or even contradictory, descriptions.

Whereas in Part I, the novel is concerned with illustrating the relationship between the character&#x27;s experiences and the actual experience and surroundings, part II, &#x27;Time Passes&#x27;, having no characters to relate to, presents events differently. Instead, Woolf wrote the section from the perspective of a displaced narrator, unrelated to any people, intending that events be seen in relation to time. For that reason the narrating voice is unfocused and distorted, providing an example of what Woolf called &#x27;life as it is when we have no part in it.&#x27; Major events like deaths of Mrs Ramsay, Prue, Andrew are related parenthetically, which makes the narration a kind of journal entry. It is also possible that the house itself is the inanimate narrator of these events.

==Novel&#x27;s Autobiographical Background==

Woolf began writing &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; partly as a way of understanding and dealing with unresolved issues concerning both her parents and indeed there are many similarities between the plot and her own life. Her visits with her parents and family to St Ives, Cornwall, where her father rented a house, were perhaps the happiest times of Woolf&#x27;s life, but when she was thirteen her mother died and, like Mr. Ramsay, her father Leslie Stephen plunged into gloom and self-pity. Woolf&#x27;s sister Vanessa Bell wrote that reading the sections of the novel that describe Mrs. Ramsay was like seeing her mother raised from the dead. Their brother Adrian was not allowed to go on an expedition to Godrevy Lighthouse, just as in the novel James looks forward to visiting the lighthouse and is disappointed when the trip is cancelled. Lily Briscoe&#x27;s meditations on painting are a way for Woolf to explore her own creative process (and also that of her painter sister), since Woolf thought of writing in the same way that Lily thought of painting.

Woolf&#x27;s father began renting Talland House in St. Ives, in 1882, shortly after Woolf&#x27;s birth. The house was used by the family as a family retreat during the summer for the next ten years. The location of the main story in &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, the house on the Hebridean island, was formed by Woolf in imitation of Talland House. Many actual features from St Ives Bay are carried into the story, including the gardens leading down to the sea, the sea itself, and the lighthouse.

Although in the novel the Ramsays return to the house on Skye after the war, the Stephens had given up Talland House by that time. After the war, Virginia Woolf visited Talland House under its new ownership with her sister Vanessa, and Woolf repeated the journey later, long after her parents were dead.

==Original Publication==
Adorned with a dust cover designed by Vanessa Bell – Virginia Woolf’s sister – the original copy of ‘To the Lighthouse’ was published in May, 1927 through Hogarth Press, which was independently owned by Virginia and Leonard Woolf. With light blue cloth and gold lettering, the original edition was printed in 3000 copies by Hogarth Press. Through the American publishing group – Harcourt Brace, &amp; Co. – the novel was released with “Pale green cloth boards; lettered in blue on spine.” This edition released the same month had 4000 copies printed for distribution. With the early success of this novel, it prompted Woolf to purchase a car and later led to her 1928 win of the Prix Femina–Vie Heureuse prize.

<doc id="790775" wikidata="Q293000" url="?curid=790775" title="Exogeny">
<text>In a variety of contexts, exogeny or exogeneity () is the fact of an action or object originating externally. It is the opposite of endogeneity or endogeny, the fact of being influenced from within a system.

== Economics ==
In an economic model, an exogenous change is one that comes from outside the model and is unexplained by the model. Such changes of an economic model from outside factors can include the influence of technology, in which this had previously been noted as an exogenous factor, but has rather been noted as a factor that can depict economic forces as a whole. In economic sociology, Project IDEA (Interdisciplinary Dimensions of Economic Analysis) gave notion to understanding the exogenous factors that play a role within economic theory. Developed from the International Social Science Council (ISSC) in the year of 1982, Project IDEA was founded to gather ideas from economists and sociologists in order to conceptualize what economic sociology incorporates, as they have sought to understand why these two fields have been estranged from each other. Such exogenous factors in economic theory include laws placed in economic systems by governments, ranks of social classes in populations, and preferences based on social factors of an individual.

=== Exogenous factors in econometrics ===
In econometrics, an endogenous random variable is correlated with the error term in the econometric model, while an exogenous variable is not. However, exogenous variables aid in the explanation of endogenous variable variances. In the preset group, it is typical to include historical values of endogenous variables. Exogenous variables are independent of the model&#x27;s disturbance term, since they are preset. They meet the same conditions as explanatory variables do in a traditional regression model. 

== Biology and medicine ==

=== Biology ===
An exogenous contrast agent, in medical imaging for example, is a liquid injected into the patient intravenously that enhances visibility of a pathology, such as a tumor. An exogenous factor is any material that is present and active in an individual organism or living cell but that originated outside that organism, as opposed to an endogenous factor.

In the origins of diseases, exogenous factors, namely those that are factors in inflammation or stress (such as overexertion, overeating, and extreme feelings of emotions of grief or anger), all contribute to exhaustion or modifications in genes. An accumulation of such stressors affect the immune system by disrupting the amount of communication that occurs between the immune system and other areas of the body. 

DNA introduced to cells via transfection or viral transduction is an exogenous factor. Exogenous factors in DNA, particularly DNA damage, are more known as environmental factors that cause progression in the impairment of DNA. Such exogenous factors would be different chemical agents, ionizing radiation (IR), and ultraviolet radiation (UV). These factors penetrate the deeper layers of the cell, causing great damage, with either apoptosis or senescence occurring, further leading to arrested or altered development and aging of the organism causing neurological disorders and cancer. 

=== Medicine and medical treatments ===
In medicine, exogenous factors are seen in both pathogens and therapeutics. Exogenous factors can be included in the type of obesity where there is an imbalance of food and metabolism, in which one consumes a much greater amount than the human body can handle. On the opposite end, endogenous obesity refers to obesity caused by disorders or issues outside an imbalance of food intake itself, which include genetic disorders, interruption of thyroid functions, and other syndromic disorders.

In relation to cancer, carcinogens are exogenous factors, in which these are made up of various factors (chemical, biological, physical), causing cancer after having entering through several routes of the body.

== Social sciences ==

=== Philosophy ===
In philosophy, the origins of existence of self, or the identity of self, emanating from, or sustaining, outside the natural or influenced realm, are exogenous.

=== Psychology ===
Exogenous constructivism prioritizes the reconstruction of structures that have already been created in the environment, which is based from a mechanical metaphor, and greatly reflects off of Bandura&#x27;s social learning theory. Overall, exogenous constructivism is noted to assume that knowledge comes from an individual&#x27;s environment, which is assumed to be learned. Because an active individual is expected to be participating in the abstraction of knowledge from its environment, practical guidance of this result of participation remains the most crucial feature of directing the learning process. The structure of the individual&#x27;s operating environment has a substantial impact on the structure of the knowledge generated. Through the perspective of Piaget, learning was known as the individual&#x27;s former structures accommodated to those imposed by its current environment. The individual&#x27;s accommodation is directed by the environment, which provides the structures to which the individual must adapt.

In attentional psychology, exogenous stimuli are external stimuli without conscious intention. An example of this is attention drawn to a flashing light in the of vision.

== Exogeny in other areas ==

=== Geography ===
In geography, exogenous processes, unlike endogenic processes, originate from external forces acting on the Earth and other planetary bodies, rather than from internal geological activity. Weathering, erosion, transportation and sedimentation are the main exogenous processes. Asides from climate, exogenous geographic factors are able to contribute to the overall process of distribution, including densities of populations and urbanizations of certain areas in the world. Exogeneity is proposed to ultimately cause geographic considerations to be rejected.

=== Ludology ===
In ludology, the study of games, an exogenous item is anything outside the game itself. Therefore, an item in a massively multiplayer online game would have exogenous value if people were buying it with real world money rather than in-game currency (though its in-game cost would be endogenous). Noted as exogenous fantasy, one may also refer to this term as extrinsic stimuli or &quot;fantasy&quot;; these describe a &quot;fantasy&quot; (game) that solely relies on the skill being mastered, rather than the other way around. These fantasies also tend to possess a few characteristics, such as (1) understanding that the fantasy and the skill that is being learned are inextricably linked, (2) the fantasy context and the instructional content being provided have an intrinsic and continuous link, and (3) endogenous fantasies tend to include more intellectually challenging and captivating content compared to exogenous fantasies. 

=== Materials science ===
In materials science, an exogenous property of a substance is derived from outside or external influences, such as a nano-doped material.

<text>Óbuda (, ) is, together with Buda and Pest, one of the three cities that were unified to form the Hungarian capital city of Budapest in 1873. Today, together with Békásmegyer, Óbuda forms a part of the city&#x27;s third district, although the toponym is also sometimes used for northern Buda as a whole. 

The neighborhood proper is centered on Fő tér beside the Szentlélek tér BHÉV station. Óbuda Island, which lies in the Danube beside Óbuda, hosts the Sziget Festival, a major annual music and cultural festival.

==History==

Settlements dating from the Stone Age have been found in Óbuda. The Romans built there Aquincum, the capital of Pannonia province. Hungarians arrived after 900 and it served as an important settlement of major tribal leaders, later kings. The site was the location of royal and ecclesiastic foundations. King Béla IV built a new capital after the 1241–42 catastrophic Mongol invasion in Buda, somewhat south of Óbuda. In the fourteenth century, Óbuda featured a convent of the Poor Clares.

The obscured historical remains of Óbuda, together with the role it played in nineteenth-century poetry, has resulted it being subject to various historical disputes.

A commemorative plaque appears on the building erected on the site of the former Jewish Elementary School in Óbuda (6 Óbuda St.) commemorating victims of the Holocaust.

==People==
*Károly Bebo (1712–1779) – sculptor
*József Manes Österreicher (1759–1831) – physician
*Pál Harrer (1829–1914) – the first and only mayor of Óbuda
*Egon Orowan (1902–1989) – physicist and metallurgist
*István Bibó (1911–1979) – politician and political theorist

==Museums==
*Aquincum Museum, small museum displays jewels, glassware, metal tools, and wall paintings relating to the lives of ancient Romans living in Aquincum. The museum&#x27;s outdoor site contains remnants of the town, including courtyards, baths, a market place, shrines, large columns, sculptures, and a stone sarcophagus. Roman ruins elsewhere in Óbuda include baths that served the Roman legionnaires stationed in Aquincum, the Hercules Villa, and two amphitheatres, the Aquincum Civil Amphitheater and the larger Aquincum Military Amphitheatre.
*Kassák Museum, a branch museum of the Petőfi Literary Museum; features items relating to the life and work of the Hungarian avant garde writer Lajos Kassák (1887–1967)
*Obudai Museum, primary collection features local history; the museum also encompasses Hungary&#x27;s only toy museum, and the Zsigmond Kun Flat Museum, which features folk furniture
*Museum of Hungarian Trade and Tourism
*Vasarely Museum, Zichy Palace, features work by Vasarely, as well as temporary exhibitions of other Hungarian artists

<doc id="790792" wikidata="Q179748" url="?curid=790792" title="Isosorbide dinitrate">
<text>Isosorbide dinitrate is a medication used for heart failure, esophageal spasms, and to treat and prevent chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart. It has been found to be particularly useful in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction together with hydralazine. It is taken by mouth or under the tongue.
Common side effects include headache, lightheadedness with standing, and blurred vision. Severe side effects include low blood pressure. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. It should not be used together with PDE5 Inhibitors. Isosorbide dinitrate is in the nitrate family of medications and works by dilating blood vessels.
Isosorbide dinitrate was first written about in 1939. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Isosorbide dinitrate is available as a generic medication. A long-acting form exists. In 2022, isosorbide was the 119th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
It is used for angina, in addition to other medications for congestive heart failure, and for esophageal spasms. It is available as an oral tablet both in extended release and slow release. The onset of action for Isosorbide Dinitrate is thirty minutes and the onset of action for oral extended release is 12–24 hours.

Long-acting nitrates can be more useful as they are generally more effective and stable in the short term.

==Side effects==
===Tolerance===
After long-term use for treating chronic conditions, tolerance may develop in patients, reducing its effectiveness. The mechanisms of nitrate tolerance have been thoroughly investigated in the last 30 years and several hypotheses have been proposed. These include: 
# Impaired biotransformation of isosorbide dinitrate to its active principle NO (or a NO-related species)
# Neurohormonal activation, causing sympathetic activation and release of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and angiotensin II which counteract the vasodilation induced by isosorbide dinitrate
# Plasma volume expansion
# The oxidative stress hypothesis

The last hypothesis might represent a unifying hypothesis, and an isosorbide dinitrate-induced inappropriate production of oxygen free radicals might induce a number of abnormalities which include the ones described above. 
Furthermore, nitrate tolerance is shown to be associated with vascular abnormalities which have the potential to worsen patients prognosis: these include endothelial and autonomic dysfunction. 

==Mechanism of action==
Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, isosorbide dinitrate is converted to nitric oxide (NO), an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A). This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent sequestration of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation.

==Society and culture==
Isosorbide dinitrate is sold in the US under the brand names Dilatrate-SR by Schwarz and Isordil by Valeant, according to FDA Orange Book. It is sold under the trade name Isoket in the United Kingdom, Argentina, and Hong Kong. It is also a component of BiDil.

<text>Endogeny, in biology, refers to the property of originating or developing from within an organism, tissue, or cell. 

For example, &quot;endogenous substances&quot;, and &quot;endogenous processes&quot; are those that originate within a living system (e.g. an organism or a cell). For instance, estradiol is an endogenous estrogen hormone produced within the body, whereas ethinylestradiol is an exogenous synthetic estrogen, commonly used in birth control pills.

In contrast, &quot;exogenous substances&quot; and &quot;exogenous&quot; &quot;processes&quot; are those that originate from outside of an organism.

<text>In probability theory, the factorial moment is a mathematical quantity defined as the expectation or average of the falling factorial of a random variable. Factorial moments are useful for studying non-negative integer-valued random variables, and arise in the use of probability-generating functions to derive the moments of discrete random variables.

Factorial moments serve as analytic tools in the mathematical field of combinatorics, which is the study of discrete mathematical structures.

==Definition==
For a natural number , the -th factorial moment of a probability distribution on the real or complex numbers, or, in other words, a random variable with that probability distribution, is

:formula_1

where the is the expectation (operator) and

:formula_2

is the falling factorial, which gives rise to the name, although the notation varies depending on the mathematical field. Of course, the definition requires that the expectation is meaningful, which is the case if or .

If is the number of successes in trials, and is the probability that any of the trials are all successes, then

:formula_3

==Examples==

===Poisson distribution===
If a random variable has a Poisson distribution with parameter &quot;λ&quot;, then the factorial moments of are

:formula_4

which are simple in form compared to its moments, which involve Stirling numbers of the second kind.

===Binomial distribution===
If a random variable has a binomial distribution with success probability and number of trials , then the factorial moments of are

:formula_5

where by convention, formula_6 and formula_7 are understood to be zero if &quot;r&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;.

===Hypergeometric distribution===
If a random variable has a hypergeometric distribution with population size , number of success states } in the population, and draws }, then the factorial moments of are 

:formula_8

===Beta-binomial distribution===
If a random variable has a beta-binomial distribution with parameters , , and number of trials , then the factorial moments of are

:formula_9

==Calculation of moments==
The &quot;r&quot;th raw moment of a random variable &quot;X&quot; can be expressed in terms of its factorial moments by the formula

:formula_10

where the curly braces denote Stirling numbers of the second kind.

<text>Dole plc (previously named Dole Food Company and [[Standard Fruit Company]]) is an Irish-American agricultural multinational corporation headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. The company is among the world&#x27;s largest producers of fruit and vegetables, operating with 38,500 full-time and seasonal employees who supply some 300 products in 75 countries. Dole reported 2021 revenues of $6.5 billion.

As of 2021, the company had approximately 250 processing plants and distribution centers worldwide in addition to of farmland and real estate. The company operates through four segments: Fresh Fruit (bananas and pineapples; about 35% of 2020 revenues); Diversified Fresh Produce in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Diversified Fresh Produce in the Americas and other world regions (combined 37% of 2020 revenues); and Fresh Vegetables (29% of 2020 revenues). Dole grows and markets bananas, pineapples, grapes, berries, deciduous and citrus fruits, and vegetable salads. Dole operates a 13-vessel shipping line for importing its produce and exporting third-party goods to Latin America.

The multinational company PepsiCo sells bottled fruit beverages under license using the &quot;Dole&quot; brand. Dole has a comarketing agreement with The Walt Disney Company to encourage the public, including children, to consume fruits and vegetables.

==History==
===18511900: Early years===

Dole plc traces its origins to the foundation of Castle &amp; Cooke in 1851, and Charles McCann&#x27;s Fish, Fruit and Vegetable Market in the 1850s in Ireland. Castle &amp; Cooke, a sugar and logistics company, was founded in Hawaii by Amos Starr Cooke and Samuel Northrup Castle.

===19001969: Expansion and acquisition===


In 1899, industrialist James Dole moved to Hawaii. James was the cousin of Sanford B. Dole, who had helped overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, and became the governor of Hawaii in 1898. Two years after James Dole&#x27;s arrival, he formed the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (HPC). The HPC delivered its first shipment of canned pineapple in 1903. Early products of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company were not marketed under a particular brand name, often assuming the names of the distributors. In the early 20th century, pineapple was still relatively unknown, and James Dole and other growers mounted a marketing campaign in magazines in what the company now refers to as one of the first nationwide advertising campaigns in the United States. In 1927, the HPC began stamping its cans with the Dole brand name, with numbers to indicate the grade. These stamps ensured the Dole name would still be visible even if the label was changed by a distributor.

The company made technological advances in the early decades of the 20th century in processing the fruitmost notably the Ginaca Machine, created in 1911that made canning pineapple commercially viable. In 1922, Dole purchased the Hawaiian island Lanai and turned it into the largest pineapple plantation in the world. The same year, Castle &amp; Cooke acquired 33% of the company via lease agreement. In 1927, the HPC began stamping its cans with the &quot;Dole&quot; brand. By the end of the 1920s, the company grew more than 75% of all pineapples in the world. However, the Hawaiian Pineapple Company struggled to stay financially sound during the Great Depression and Castle &amp; Cooke took control of it in 1932. The HPC was renamed the &quot;Dole Company&quot; and became a subsidiary of Castle &amp; Cooke in 1961. Two years later, the company began expanding its fruit growing operations into southeast Asia, opening plantations and canneries in the Philippines and Thailand.

While the HPC was getting established, the tropical fruit trade was growing in Central and South America, primarily with the banana trade. One of the major players in that trade, the Standard Fruit and Steamship Company, was established in 1906 by the Vaccaro brothers and Salvador D&#x27;Antoni as Vaccaro Brothers and Company. However, the quartet had been making shipments of tropical fruit such as bananas and coconuts, as well as other items, since 1899. The firm grew rapidly in its early years, establishing a headquarters in La Ceiba, Honduras, purchasing housing and cargo ships, and building rail and telephone lines at its plantations. The company&#x27;s rapid growth has been attributed to the destruction of property records in the early 20th century, leading the firm to take control of large swaths of land with the support of the Honduran government. In 1924, the firm went public as the Standard Fruit and Steamship Company. In the 1920s, as Panama disease was destroying crops of the Gros Michel banana, Standard Fruit began looking for other cultivars to grow, settling on the Cavendish banana. Switching to the Cavendish allowed Standard Fruit to become the largest banana producer in the world by the 1960s. Standard Fruit merged with Castle &amp; Cooke in 1968.

While these companies were forming in the United States, the McCanns expanded their operations in Ireland, opening a store in Dundalk in 1902. In the 1950s, the McCanns began consolidating with other companies in Ireland, creating United Fruit Importers and then Fruit Importers of Ireland, which became a publicly traded company.

===19702000: Expansions, selloffs, and splits===

Ten years after its merger with Standard Fruit, Castle &amp; Cooke acquired Bud Antle Inc., a California-based vegetable company. However, Castle &amp; Cooke began to struggle financially and was purchased in 1985 by billionaire David H. Murdock. After the purchase, Dole began expanding its offerings by purchasing other food companies, buying several West Coast fruit and nut producers and distributors between 1985 and 1990, including Bonner Packing Company in California and Wells and Wade Fruit Company in Washington. Meanwhile, in Ireland, Fruit Importers of Ireland purchased Fyffes from Chiquita in 1986.

Murdock separated Dole and Castle &amp; Cooke in 1996, turning the latter into a real estate development company. 
===2000present: Recovery and merger with Total Produce===
In the early 2000s, Dole struggled financially and was nearly bankrupt. Murdock rescued the company, which had been publicly traded, and took it private in 2003.

During this same period, lawsuits related to the use of the pesticide DBCP were filed against Dole. The company, along with Shell and Dow Chemical Company, was ordered by a court in Managua, Nicaragua, to pay banana workers $489.4 million in 2003, but the companies declined to pay the fine. In 2007, a California judge awarded $2.3 million to Nicaraguan banana workers who sued Dole for its DBCP use. However, the ruling was overturned in 2010, with another judge noting a lack of evidence connecting the workers to Dole plantations and fraud committed by the plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers. Swedish filmmaker Fredrik Gertten made a documentary about the latter lawsuit, entitled &quot;Bananas!*&quot;, which led to a defamation lawsuit by Dole. Dole lost the suit and was ordered to pay the filmmakers SEK 1,400,000. Gertten made a follow-up documentary about the defamation suit that premiered in 2012, entitled &quot;Big Boys Gone Bananas!*&quot;.

Total Produce was spun off from Fyffes in 2006 as a fresh fruit and vegetable business separate from the tropical fruits business of Fyffes. Upon establishment, the firm was one of the largest produce companies in Europe, leading in Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and the Czech Republic. In 2007, Total Produce expanded further into the United Kingdom, purchasing British firm Redbridge Holdings for £11.75 million.

In 2009, Dole was sued by families of banana workers in Colombia, who alleged that the company had bankrolled militias that killed thousands of Colombians, including trade union organizers. The suit was dismissed with prejudice the following year.

Murdock took Dole public again in 2009, raising $446 million in the process.

In 2012, Dole reached a deal to sell its packaged food division and Asian fresh produce operations to the Japanese firm Itochu for $1.7 billion, with the purchase concluding in April 2013. As part of the Itochu deal, the Dole brand continued to be used for some packaged food products worldwide and fresh produce in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, although the Dole Food Company had no business involvement for these products. In August 2013, Murdock reacquired Dole as a private company at a valuation of $1.6 billion. He and Dole Food Company President Michael Carter were later sued by investors for undervaluing the company during the Itochu deal, and in 2015, a judge in Delaware ordered the pair to pay shareholders $148 million for intentionally lowering the value of Dole stock prior to the buyout.

Total Produce purchased a 45% stake in the Dole Food Company in 2018, and merged with Dole in 2021 to form Dole plc. Dole plc () began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in July 2021.


==Operations==
Covering five continents, Dole has of its own farmland, 13 cargo vessels, five manufacturing plants, 75 packing houses and 160 distribution centers. Dole is a vertically integrated producer, owning plantations in Central America. Its container ships are specially equipped with refrigerated containers, and use their own cranes instead of relying on port infrastructure.

===Management===
As of 2021, Rory Byrne is CEO, Carl McCann is chairman, and Johan Lindén is chief operating officer.

===Headquarters===
Following the 2021 merger with Total Produce, Dole plc has world headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and US headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Public relations===
The Guinness Book of World Records (2007) lists the pineapple maze at the Dole Plantation on Oahu, Hawaii as the world&#x27;s largest maze.

&quot;Bobby Banana&quot;, a mascot of Dole plc, is an anthropomorphic banana who appears in Dole comics and games for children.

==Products==
Including pineapples, Dole products include some 300 fresh plant foods as whole deciduous and citrus fruits, berries, and fresh-cut vegetables; salad products include greens, salad kits, and shreds.

===Brand licensing===
As of 2022, Dole has a brand licensing arrangement with The Walt Disney Company for fruits and vegetables branded with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars fictional characters to encourage produce consumption among children, such as using stickers on bananas. The arrangement includes cobranded recipes featuring Disney films, including &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;Frozen II&quot;.

The Dole brand is also under license with Pepsico for bottled fruit beverages.

==Food safety==
As Dole products include fruits and vegetables grown in open fields, Dole uses rigorous food safety procedures under Good Agricultural Practices for its own farms and those of contract growers. In California, Dole is a certified member of the Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA), a collaboration of food scientists and safety experts, government, farmers, shippers, and processors. Dole operates a &quot;SafetyChain system&quot;, which is a cellphone-based process for quality assurance on the farm (region, grower, and lot number), including immediate reports on non-compliance issues.

Over decades, Dole has initiated several recalls of its products and shut down manufacturing facilities for cleaning in response to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, primarily related to bagged salads and leafy greens.

===2000s===
Officials with the Minnesota Department of Health found &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157:H7 in Dole bagged lettuce in 2005. The outbreak infected 25 people in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Oregon. The following year, an &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak that infected more than 200 people and killed three was traced back to a spinach processor in California which packaged spinach under the Dole brand. Dole initiated a recall of the tainted spinach.

According to Dole personnel and the California LGMA, this 2006 &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak led 
to harmonizing new rigorous farm and handling practices across the fresh produce industry to minimize microbial contamination.

===2010s===

Dole recalled its &quot;Seven Lettuces&quot; salads in 2012 after random testing by New York health officials found &quot;salmonella&quot; in the salads. The same year, the company issued two recalls of its bagged salads due to contamination by &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;. The company initiated another recall due to contamination by &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; in 2014. The following year, Dole recalled bagged spinach due to contamination with &quot;salmonella&quot; following safety testing conducted by the United States Food and Drug Administration at a plant in Springfield, Ohio.

In 2016, an outbreak of listeriosis tied to the Springfield plant led to the hospitalization of 33 people and four deaths. The plant closed for four months that year, and later reporting revealed Dole knew about the listeria contamination in July 2014, more than a year before the plant&#x27;s closure. The United States Department of Justice initiated a criminal probe into the issue. Dole settled two civil lawsuits related to the outbreak in 2017.

===2020s===
In December 2021, Dole recalled 180 varieties of packaged salad due to possible listeria contamination and closed packaging facilities in Yuma, Arizona, and Bessemer City, North Carolina, to sanitize them. The outbreak led to an investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after two people died and 17 became ill.

<doc id="790831" wikidata="Q1247529" url="?curid=790831" title="Mannix">
<text>Mannix is an American detective television series that originally aired for eight seasons on CBS from September 16, 1967 to March 13, 1975. The show was created by Richard Levinson and William Link, and developed by executive producer Bruce Geller. The title character, Joe Mannix, is a private investigator played by actor Mike Connors.

==Premise==
During the first season of the series, Joe Mannix works for a large Los Angeles detective agency called Intertect, which was the planned original title of the show. His superior is Lew Wickersham, played by Joseph Campanella. Intertect uses computers to help solve crimes.

As opposed to the other employees, Mannix belonged to the classic American detective archetype, thus usually ignoring the computers&#x27; solutions, disobeying his boss&#x27;s orders, and setting out to do things his own way. He wears plaid sport coats and has his own office that he keeps sloppy between his assignments. Lew has cameras in all the rooms of the Intertect offices monitoring the performance of his employees and providing instant feedback through intercoms in the room. Unlike the other Intertect operatives, Mannix attempts to block the camera with a coat rack and questions Lew, comparing him to Big Brother.

To improve the ratings of the show, Desilu head Lucille Ball and producer Bruce Geller made some changes, making the show similar to other private-eye shows. Ball thought stories featuring computers were too high-tech and beyond the comprehension of the average viewer of the time, so the focus of the show changed. 

In the first episode of season two, Mannix explains that he had quit Intertect. From the second season on, Mannix worked on his own, with the assistance of his loyal secretary Peggy Fair, a police officer&#x27;s widow played by Gail Fisher, one of the first black actresses featured in a regular series role. 

Mannix also has a working relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department, as he often exchanges information with his contacts. The first of these to have a featured role was Lieutenant George Kramer, portrayed by Larry Linville, who had been partnered with Peggy&#x27;s late husband. Over the course of the series, Mannix&#x27;s most frequently used contact is Lieutenant Art Malcolm, played by Ward Wood. Another semiregular guest, although not as frequent, was Robert Reed, whose appearances as Lieutenant Adam Tobias coincided with his tenure on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, which also was produced by Paramount Television. 

Jack Ging played another Mannix contact, Lieutenant Dan Ives, who made several appearances later in the series. Yet another LAPD contact was Lieutenant Dave Angstrom, played by Frank Campanella (real-life brother of Joseph Campanella). In the 1969 season, he also employs the services of a competitive private investigator, Albie Loos (performed by Joe Mantell), as a sort of investigative gofer. In the 1972 season, Albie returns, played by a different actor (Milton Selzer).

While &quot;Mannix&quot; was not generally known as a show that explored socially relevant topics, several episodes had topical themes. Season two had episodes featuring compulsive gambling, deaf and blind characters who were instrumental in solving cases in spite of their physical limitations, and episodes that focused on racism against Blacks and Hispanics. Season four had an episode focusing on the effects of CTE on a former boxing champion. Season five had an episode focusing on the effects of alcoholism and an episode about fragging. Season six had an episode focusing on the effects that the Vietnam War had on returning veterans, including the effects of PTSD. Season eight had an episode focusing on a rape-induced pregnancy.

==Character==
Joseph R. &quot;Joe&quot; Mannix is a regular guy, without pretense, who has a store of proverbs on which to rely in conversation. What demons he has mostly come from having fought in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, where as an Airborne Ranger Lieutenant he led a twelve-man team operating behind enemy lines for three months before being captured by the Chinese Communists; he was initially listed as MIA while interned as a prisoner of war in a brutal POW camp, until he escaped. Over the length of the series, a sizable percentage of his old Army comrades turn out to have homicidal impulses against him, as does his fellow running back from his college football days.

During the series, Mannix is also revealed to have worked as a mercenary in Latin America. Like the actor Mike Connors who played the title role, Mannix is of Armenian descent, and speaks fluent Armenian from time to time during the series, as well as conversational Spanish.

Mannix is notable for the high level of physical punishment he withstands. During the course of the series, he is shot and wounded over a dozen separate times, and knocked unconscious around 55 times. He frequently takes brutal beatings to the abdomen; some of these went on quite a long time, particularly by the television standards of the era. Whenever he gets into one of his convertibles (in season one, Mannix drove a customized Oldsmobile Toronado, replete with a panoramic rear-view mirror; in seasons 2–6, he drove a 1968 Dodge Dart GTS 340 or 1970-73 Plymouth Barracudas; in the final season, he drove a Chevrolet Camaro), he can expect to be shot at or run off the road by another car or find his vehicle sabotaged. Nevertheless, he keeps his cool and perseveres until his antagonists are brought down.

While making the television pilot &quot;The Name Is Mannix&quot;, Connors dislocated his shoulder running away during a &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;–type helicopter pursuit, and broke his left wrist punching a stuntman who happened to be wearing a steel plate on his back. This character aspect was lampooned multiple times by radio comedians Bob and Ray, with &quot;Blimmix&quot; beginning as being portrayed as dim-witted, and ending with Blimmix being soundly beaten by his adversary. These parodies retained the theme song composed by Lalo Schifrin at the beginning and conclusion.

Starting in season two, Mannix lives and works in West Los Angeles in a mixed-use development called Paseo Verde; his home at 17 Paseo Verde has an attached office from which he runs his agency. The design for the 17 Paseo Verde set is based on a Santa Barbara, California, building that still exists.

Mannix grew up in a town called Summer Grove, where he was a star football and basketball player. Summer Grove had a thriving Armenian immigrant community. As of 1969, Mannix&#x27;s mother had died 10 years earlier, and Mannix had not been back to the town since the funeral. Mannix&#x27;s estranged father, Stefan (played by Victor Jory), was still living in Summer Grove, and Mannix and his father started a reconciliation. When Mannix returns to Summer Grove for a case three years later, he and his father are on good terms.

Following military service in the Korean War, Mannix attended Western Pacific University on the GI Bill, graduated in 1955, and obtained his private investigator&#x27;s license in 1956. He has a black belt in karate. Throughout the series, he appears proficient in a variety of athletic pursuits, including sailing, horseback riding, and skiing. He is an accomplished pool player and golfs regularly, and is also a skilled airplane pilot. In the first season, he carries a Walther PP semiautomatic pistol. From the second season on, Mannix carries a Colt Detective Special snubnosed revolver in .38 Special caliber.

===Appearances on other shows===
In 1971, Connors guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; entitled &quot;Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage&quot;.

In 1997, Connors reprised the role of Mannix in an episode of &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Hard-Boiled Murder&quot;, which served as a sequel to the 1973 &quot;Mannix&quot; episode &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;. Several other actors from the old &quot;Mannix&quot; episode also reprised their roles. In a comic reference to Mannix&#x27;s famous history of serious injuries, the show portrayed the main character of &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot;, Dr. Mark Sloan (Dick Van Dyke), as Mannix&#x27;s longtime physician.

&quot;Mannix&quot; was referred to several times in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episodes when a foot chase or a fight occurred.

==Production==
Gary Morton, Lucille Ball&#x27;s second husband and head of Desilu Studios, noticed a 1937 Bentley convertible being driven by Mike Connors. A car enthusiast, Morton began talking about cars to Connors, when he remembered a Desilu detective show coming up in which he thought Connors would do well.

&quot;Mannix&quot; was initially a production of Desilu Productions, which had been purchased by Gulf + Western earlier in 1967. During the first season, Gulf + Western integrated Desilu&#x27;s operations into its Paramount Pictures subsidiary, and the company became Paramount Television. The series featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to theme music from noted composer Lalo Schifrin. Unusual for a private detective series, the &quot;Mannix&quot; theme is in triple time, the same signature used for waltzes.

The show&#x27;s title card, opening credits, and closing credits roll are set in variations of the City typeface, a squared-off, split-serif face that was long used by IBM Corporation as part of their corporate design and still appears in their logo. This refers to the computers used by Intertect in the first season. The dot over the &quot;i&quot; in Mannix had the appearance of a computer tape reel. This was removed after the first season.

Over the life of the series, several famous entertainers were featured in one-time roles, including Neil Diamond and Buffalo Springfield as themselves and Lou Rawls as a club singer, Rich Little as an impressionist, and Milton Berle as a stand-up comedian. Essay humorist Art Buchwald also had a cameo role unrelated to journalism, and in another episode, Rona Barrett played herself.

===Cancellation===
&quot;Mannix&quot; finished its eighth season in the top 20 in the Nielsen ratings and plans were made for a ninth season. Mike Connors said that he had been told at a CBS network party the week before the network was to release its 1975 fall schedule that the show was a certain pickup. The reason for the cancellation was, that competing Network ABC, looking to improve its ratings, began contacting production companies in an attempt to purchase rebroadcast rights for various series. At the time, ABC and Paramount had a fairly successful relationship that was starting to build. ABC took advantage of that and approached Paramount with an offer to purchase the rights to rebroadcast older episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot; as part of their late-night lineup, which they agreed to do.

CBS was unhappy with the move, as Paramount had not informed them of what they were planning to do. The idea of having one of their series airing on a competing network, even if it was only in reruns, turned the tide of opinion against &quot;Mannix&quot;, as CBS felt viewers would stay away from the newer episodes airing on their network since they could watch the series on a competitor. Thus, when CBS released its schedule a few days later, &quot;Mannix&quot; was not a part of it. Connors found out about the cancellation through a phone call, with a reporter contacting him asking for comment. Connors said in a later interview, &quot;I felt so lost when it was over.&quot;

===Mannix&#x27;s automobiles===
The automobile was a focus of Mannix&#x27;s professional life, and he had several of them as his personal vehicle in the eight-year run of the series. Those were:
* Season one – 1966 Mercury Comet Caliente convertible (pilot episode: &quot;The Name Is Mannix&quot;), 1967 Mercury Comet Cyclone convertible (one episode only: &quot;Skid Marks on a Dry Run&quot;), 1967 Ford Galaxie 500 four-door hardtop, then a 1967 Ford Fairlane 500 four-door sedan after the Galaxie got shot up – both were Intertect company cars (one episode only: &quot;The Cost of a Vacation&quot;). In all other season-one episodes, Mannix drove a 1967 Oldsmobile Toronado customized into a roadster by George Barris, builder of TV&#x27;s Batmobile from the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; ABC series, since the producers wanted a convertible and Oldsmobile never produced an open-topped Toronado. Due to a change in episode run order (&quot;The Cost of a Vacation&quot; was the second episode of Mannix shot after the pilot, although it was the sixth episode CBS broadcast), the one-shot appearances of the Galaxie and Fairlane were after the Toronado had been established as Mannix&#x27;s car.
* Season two – 1968 Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible &quot;kustomized&quot; by George Barris with functional hood scoops, Lucas Flamethrower driving lights, blacked-out grille, racing-style gas filler cap, molded-in rear spoiler, blacked out tail light panel, and custom tail light lenses. The car was originally red, but Executive Producer Bruce Geller wanted it changed to a British Racing Green, which Barris did. (This car still retains its original red paint under the carpet.) A Motorola car-phone (a remarkably expensive and rare item in 1968) was installed. Rader mag wheels like those on the Batmobile were originally installed by Barris, but changed later in the 1968 season to Cragar S/S chrome wheels. Barris also installed his own &quot;Barris Kustoms&quot; emblem on the lower part of each front fender. No duplicate 1968 Mannix Darts were built; it is a &quot;one of one&quot; car. This car was used in both the 1968 and 1969 seasons.

Though a 1969 Dart was built by Barris to replicate this car in the show&#x27;s 1969 season, the 1968 Dart was regularly seen during the 1969 season. (In the 1969 episode &quot;A Penny for the Peep Show&quot;, both the 1968 and 1969 Darts are used in the same shot, to elude a police tail on Mannix, but no explanation in the episode was given for why or how two identically customized green Dart convertibles show up together.)

In further tracing the car&#x27;s history, the 1968 Dart was reportedly sold to a secretary at Paramount Studios and then was lost for decades until being discovered near a ranger station in the Southern California mountains. It has since been restored to its original Mannix/Barris condition and was featured in Hemmings &quot;Muscle Machines&quot;, December 2009 issue.

The 1968 &quot;Mannix&quot; Dart and its intriguing history were also featured on the TV show &quot;Drive&quot; on Discovery HD Theater in 2010. The TV show reunited the car with Mike Connors for the first time in over 40 years. 

The car is currently owned by C. Van Tune, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine, who conducted the TV interview with Mike Connors and who also wrote an article on the &quot;Mannix&quot; Dart for the summer 2011 issue of &quot;Motor Trend Classic&quot; magazine. In that article, the Dart is reunited with Mike Connors, George Barris, and&quot; Mannix &quot;stuntman Dick Ziker.

Another article on the famous Dart was published in the October 2011 issue of &quot;Mopar Action&quot; magazine. An article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (July 22, 2012) included information on the 1968 &quot;Mannix&quot; Dart and a recent photo of Mike Connors with the car. The &quot;Mannix&quot; Dart was also mentioned on Sirius/XM Radio&#x27;s &quot;60s on 6&quot; channel by disc jockey Mike Kelly.

In October 2016, the car magazine &quot;Power &amp; Performance News&quot; published an article on the 1968 &quot;Mannix&quot; Dart, written by C. Van Tune.

* Season three – A 1969 Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible was &quot;kustomized&quot; by George Barris to replicate the 1968 Dart; this car was totalled in a wreck soon after being sold, following its use on the series.
* Season four – 1970 Plymouth Barracuda 340 dark green convertible
* Season five – Three 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertibles (all dark green with green interiors and black soft tops) were supplied by Chrysler Corporation, and all had differently sized (318, 340, 383) engines. One was wrecked, but later repaired. In one episode, the hood is raised, dynamite is discovered, and the air cleaner reads 383.
* Season six – 1973 Plymouth Barracuda convertible (actually two of the 1971 cars updated with 1973 grilles, headlamps, front fenders, front/rear bumpers, and tail lights)
* Season seven – 1974 Dodge Challenger 360 Coupe: Two were built especially for the show, and had every available option installed, including the rare factory sunroof. Mild Barris customizing included Cragar S/S 15-inch chrome wheels, G60x15 Goodyear radial tires, and an upper body pinstripe.
* Season eight – A Chevrolet Camaro LT, and a red 1975 Chevrolet Impala two-door with a white convertible roof were used.

Peggy Fair&#x27;s cars were less prominent, but in seasons two through eight, they included a Simca 1000, Simca 1204 hatchback, Dodge Colt hardtop, and finally a Chevrolet Vega hatchback.

<text>Lucia (died aft. 1292 or ca 1299) was the last countess of Tripoli, a Crusader state in the Levant.

==Biography==
She was the daughter of Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Sibylla of Armenia. Her brother was Bohemund VII of Tripoli. When Bohemund VII died in 1287, their mother appointed as regent Bertrand of Gibelet. He proved to be very unpopular with the commune of the city, who created their own administration.

In 1288, Lucia then came to Tripoli from Apulia, Italy to take control of the county, although she was opposed by both the commune and the Genoese, due to her marriage in ca 1275 or 1278 to Narjot de Toucy in Auxerre. The Genoese, led by Benedetto I Zaccaria, tried to install a &quot;podestà&quot;, an official administrator from Genoa, which would have made Tripoli essentially a Genoese colony. At this the leader of the commune consented to acknowledge Lucia, but Lucia unexpectedly allied herself with the Genoese instead.

The Venetians and Pisans, who also had trading links with Tripoli, were shocked at this and supposedly conspired with the Mamluk sultan Qalawun to attack the city. Lucia allied with the Mongols, who, knowing that Tripoli was too weak to defend itself even with their help, asked for support from Europe, although no aid was to be found there. Qalawun started the Siege of Tripoli for one month in 1289 and captured it on April 26. Two years later Acre, the last Crusader outpost in the Holy Land was also captured by the Mamluk Sultanate.

Although he could have claimed the county through her, Lucia&#x27;s husband never came to Tripoli, as he was attending to business in the Kingdom of Naples, where he died in 1292. The date of Lucia&#x27;s death is unknown. Narjot and Lucia had one son, Philippe II de Toucy, who inherited the lordship of Laterza on Narjot&#x27;s death and the claim to Antioch on Lucia&#x27;s death.

The band was formed by Adam Rourke and then-teenage singer/guitarist Noelle LeBlanc. The band was originally known as Noelle, and released an album called &quot;This Summer&quot; under that name, which was later re-recorded as &quot;From the Attic&quot;.

Damone released their first album, &quot;From the Attic&quot;, on RCA in 2003. Original lead guitarist Dave Pino left the band some time in 2004, being replaced by Mike Woods from Boston.

While working on new material, the band was dropped from its label after requesting to be released. They were quickly picked up by Island Def-Jam Records.

Damone released their second LP, &quot;Out Here All Night&quot;, on iTunes in early 2006, with the CD version released on May 23, 2006. There was heavy rotation of the song &quot;Out Here All Night&quot;, and the band toured extensively throughout the Americas, Canada, Asia &amp; Europe.

Damone released their third album, &quot;Roll the Dice&quot;, in 2008. They then toured the UK as support to the Wildhearts.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Revolution&quot; is the official anthem for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.

In 2012 Candlebox covered &quot;Out Here All Night&quot; on their album &quot;Love Stories &amp; Other Musings&quot;.

On December 8, 2011, the band&#x27;s drummer, Dustin Hengst, died at the age of 39 from liver and kidney failure.

In April 2019, Damone announced they would reunite for two shows in Boston that July.

<text>The Verlaines are a New Zealand rock band from Dunedin. Formed in 1981 by Graeme Downes, Craig Easton, Anita Pillai, Phillip Higham and Greg Kerr, the band went through multiple line-ups. Formed at the beginning of Dunedin sound, The Verlaines were a key figure in the early history of Flying Nun Records.

==History==
The band was named after French poet Paul Verlaine — not, as is occasionally suggested, Tom Verlaine, who also took his stage name from the poet. &quot;I had just been reading some of his poetry,&quot; Downes told Paul A. Harris in 1993, &quot;and threw the name at the head of the row, and we thought it sounded cool.&quot; Their recorded debut was on the seminal &quot;Dunedin Double&quot; EP, which was released by Flying Nun Records and was the debut of several bands who would go on to be central to the mythology of the Dunedin sound.

The Verlaines are noted for their angular, &quot;difficult&quot; song structures, wordy and downbeat lyrics, unusual subject matter, all contained in often frantic up-tempo playing. The Verlaines are led by songwriter and vocalist/guitarist Graeme Downes, although many other New Zealand musicians played guitar, bass, drums and brass instruments during the different stages of the band. Downes was an academic at the University of Otago, where he had previously been the head of the Department of Music, until 2020 when he retired after a cancer diagnosis. He taught contemporary music and has research interests in Mahler and Shostakovich. He has released one solo album, &quot;Hammers and Anvils&quot;, which came out on Matador Records in 2001.

The group&#x27;s signature songs include &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, &quot;C.D. Jimmy Jazz &amp; Me&quot;, &quot;Bird-dog&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Harry Noryb.&quot;

In 2003, a career retrospective, &quot;You&#x27;re Just Too Obscure for Me&quot;, was released.

The Verlaines contributed the soundtrack to the film &quot;Eden&quot;, collaborating with actor Adetokunbo Adu, and screenwriter Rebecca Tansley. A song from Eden, &quot;What Sound is This?&quot; appeared on their album &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot; in 2012.

The band&#x27;s latest studio album, &quot;Dunedin Spleen&quot;, was released exclusively via digital download in 2019. One year later, having been picked up by Schoolkids Records, an independent label out of North Carolina, it was released as a limited edition white vinyl, gatefold 2xLP on 24 October 2020, to coincide with Record Store Day. There were only 700 copies made available worldwide. On 4 June 2021, the album made its debut on compact disc for further consumption.

== Discography ==
=== Featured appearances ===
The group have appeared on several compilations over the years in New Zealand and overseas.
* (1987) – &quot;Tuatara: A Flying Nun Compilation&quot; – &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;

<doc id="790897" wikidata="Q3795484" url="?curid=790897" title="Henderson the Rain King">
<text>Henderson the Rain King is a 1959 novel by Saul Bellow. The book&#x27;s blend of philosophical discourse and comic adventure has helped make it one of his more popular works.

The novel is said to be Bellow&#x27;s favorite among his books. It was ranked number 21 on Modern Library&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Novels in the English language.

==Plot==
Eugene Henderson is a troubled middle-aged man. Despite his riches, high social status, and physical prowess, he feels restless and unfulfilled, and harbors a spiritual void that manifests itself as an inner voice crying out &quot;I want, I want, I want.&quot; Hoping to discover what the voice wants, Henderson goes to Africa.

Upon reaching Africa, Henderson splits with his original group and hires a native guide, Romilayu. Romilayu leads Henderson to the village of the Arnewi, where Henderson befriends the leaders of the village. He learns that the cistern from which the Arnewi get their drinking water is plagued by frogs, thus rendering the water &quot;unclean&quot; according to local taboos. Henderson attempts to save the Arnewi by ridding them of the frogs, but his enthusiastic scheme ends in disaster, destroying the frogs and the village&#x27;s cistern.

Henderson and Romilayu travel to the village of the Wariri. Here, Henderson impulsively performs a feat of strength by moving the giant wooden statue of the goddess Mummah and unwittingly becomes the Wariri Rain King, Sungo. He quickly develops a friendship with the native-born but western-educated King Dahfu, with whom he engages in a series of far-reaching philosophical discussions.

The elders send Dahfu to find a lion, which is supposedly the reincarnation of the late king, Dahfu&#x27;s father. The lion hunt fails, and the lion mortally wounds the king. Henderson learns shortly before Dahfu&#x27;s death that the Rain King is the next person in the line of succession for the throne. Having no interest in being king and desiring only to return home, Henderson flees the Wariri village.

Although it is unclear whether Henderson has truly found spiritual contentment, the novel ends with an optimistic and uplifting note.

==Discussion==
Henderson learns that a man can, with effort, have a spiritual rebirth when he realizes that spirit, body and the outside world are not enemies but can live in harmony.

A week before the novel appeared in book stores, Bellow published an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;The Search for Symbols, a Writer Warns, Misses All the Fun and Fact of the Story.&quot; Here, Bellow warns readers against looking too deeply for symbols in literature. This has led to much discussion among critics as to why Bellow warned his readers against searching for symbolism just before the symbol-packed &quot;Rain King&quot; hit the shelves.
The ongoing philosophical discussions and ramblings between Henderson and the natives, and inside Henderson&#x27;s own head, prefigure elements of Bellow&#x27;s next novel &quot;Herzog&quot; (1964), which includes many such inquiries into life and meaning.

As in all Bellow&#x27;s novels, death figures prominently in &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;. Also, the novel manifests a few common character types that run through Bellow&#x27;s literary works. One type is the Bellovian Hero, often described as a schlemiel. Eugene Henderson, in company with most of Bellow&#x27;s main characters, can be given this description, in the opinion of some people. Another is what Bellow calls the &quot;Reality-Instructor&quot;; in &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;, King Dahfu fills this role. In &quot;Seize the Day&quot;, the instructor is played by Dr. Tamkin, while in &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;, Humboldt von Fleisher takes the part.

Scholars such as Bellow biographer James Atlas and others have shown that quite a few passages and ideas were lifted from a book titled &quot;The Cattle Complex in East Africa&quot; (1926) written by Bellow&#x27;s anthropology professor Melville Herskovits who supervised his senior thesis at Northwestern University in 1937.

==Pulitzer Prize==
In 1960, the Pulitzer Prize committee for fiction recommended &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; be awarded the prize for that year. The Pulitzer board, which have final say over the awarding of the prize, overrode their recommendation and chose &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; by Allen Drury.

==Other media==
*Leon Kirchner adapted &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; into the libretto for his opera &quot;Lily&quot;, which premiered at the New York City Opera in the spring of 1977. It was not a success, and was Kirchner&#x27;s only foray into opera.
*&quot;Rain King&quot; is a song by Terence Boylan from his 1977 album &quot;Terence Boylan&quot;. It is clearly based on Bellow&#x27;s novel.
*&quot;Rain King&quot; is a song by Counting Crows from their 1993 album &quot;August and Everything After&quot;. &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; and its characters were an inspiration in the song&#x27;s writing. 
*One passage in the novel inspired Joni Mitchell to write the song &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; in 1967.
*&quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; was mentioned as the favorite book of the character Ally McBeal in season 1, episode 3 of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, titled &quot;The Kiss&quot;.

<doc id="790910" wikidata="Q7731759" url="?curid=790910" title="The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee">
<text>The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee in Hohenwald, Tennessee, is a non-profit organization licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), and a member of both the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS). Founded in 1995, The Sanctuary has provided a home to 32 elephants retired from zoos and circuses. The Elephant Sanctuary provides these elephants with a natural habitat, individualized care for life, and the opportunity to live out their lives in a safe haven dedicated to their well being. The elephant habitats are not open to the public.

At over , the sanctuary consists of three separate and protected, natural habitat environments for Asian and African elephants; a Asian facility, a quarantine area and a African habitat.

The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee has a four-star rating from Charity Navigator.

==History==
In 1995, Carol Buckley purchased a 113 acre parcel of land in Lewis County, Tennessee, and built a barn to retire her elephant, Tarra. Shortly after, The Elephant Sanctuary (TES) was established and acquired their non profit status. In 1999, the property was purchased from Buckley by the non profit organization. Buckley was the guarantor for the loan for a second barn added in 1999 at which time four elephants had been rescued and living with Tarra. In 2001, a section of land with a lake was acquired. Another were purchased and the sanctuary expanded to in 2003. Again, Buckley was the guarantor for the loan. The first two African elephants were accepted for the new African habitat in 2004. The existing herd of Asian elephants was relocated to a new habitat to accommodate eight incoming elephants who needed to be quarantined in 2005. This new area includes a barn and hay barn which is able to hold up to 35,000 bales of hay.

==Facilities==
The development of the Sanctuary was done in several stages. It was originally built in phases and then expanded whenever funding was available or the elephants needed more space or accommodation. Twenty miles of double fencing encloses The Elephant Sanctuary&#x27;s . Heated barns located in the Asia, Africa, and Quarantine Habitats offer additional warmth during the cooler winter months. The Asia and Africa barn designs were conceptualized by the co-founders and were constructed using Leadership in Environmental and Energy design plans. The facilities have many features that protect the environment and reduce their carbon footprint.

As of 2024, twelve elephants have homes at the Elephant Sanctuary.

==Education==
The Elephant Sanctuary&#x27;s Elephant Discovery Center, opened in 2019, hosts drop-in visitors Saturdays 9 AM to 4 PM. Although the visitors cannot physically see the elephants (in keeping with Sanctuary philosophy), they can interact with staff and watch the elephants via live-streaming EleCams. The Discovery Center also provides in-person programs for school groups, civic/social groups, and the general public upon request.

The Sanctuary also has a web-based Distance Learning program that allows The Sanctuary to link up with classrooms and other audiences online. These programs are also available upon request.

<doc id="790928" wikidata="Q4410649" url="?curid=790928" title="Appointment in Samarra">
<text>Appointment in Samarra, published in 1934, is the first novel by American writer John O&#x27;Hara (1905–1970). It concerns the self-destruction of the fictional character Julian English, a wealthy car dealer who was once a member of the social elite of Gibbsville (O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s fictionalized version of Pottsville, Pennsylvania). The book created controversy due to O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s inclusion of sexual content.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; 22nd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Title==
The title is a reference to W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s retelling of an ancient Mesopotamian tale which appears as an epigraph for the novel:There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the marketplace I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went. Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.

In his foreword to the 1952 reprint, O&#x27;Hara says that the working title for the novel was &quot;The Infernal Grove&quot;. He got the idea for the title &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; when Dorothy Parker showed him the story in Maugham&#x27;s play, &quot;Sheppey&quot;. He says &quot;Dorothy didn&#x27;t like the title; [publisher] Alfred Harcourt didn&#x27;t like the title; his editors didn&#x27;t like it; nobody liked it but me.&quot; O&#x27;Hara describes it as a reference to &quot;the inevitability of Julian English&#x27;s death&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel describes how, over the course of three days, Julian English destroys himself with a series of impulsive acts, culminating in suicide. O&#x27;Hara never gives any obvious cause or explanation for his behavior, which is apparently predestined by his character. Facts about Julian gradually emerge throughout the novel. He is about 30 years old. He is college educated, owns a well-established Cadillac dealership, and within the Gibbsville community belongs to the prestigious &quot;Lantenengo Street crowd&quot;.

English is introduced seven pages into the novel, in the thoughts of the wife of one of his employees: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t trade her life for Caroline English&#x27;s, not if you paid her. She wondered if Julian and Caroline were having another one of their battle royales&quot;. Within the three days of the novel, Julian gets drunk several times. One long lyrical paragraph describes one of his hangovers. During the first of two suicidal reveries, we learn that his greatest fear is that he will eventually lose his wife to another man. Yet within three days, he sexually propositions two women, succeeding once, with an ease and confidence suggesting this is well-practiced behavior.

On successive days, he commits three impulsive acts, which are serious enough to damage his reputation, his business, and his relationship with his wife. First, he throws a drink in the face of Harry Reilly, a man we learn later is an important investor in his business. The man is a sufficiently well-known Catholic that Julian knows word will spread among the Gibbsville Catholic community, many of whom are his customers.

In a curious device, repeated for each of the incidents, the omniscient narrator never actually shows us the details of the incident. He shows us Julian fantasizing in great detail about throwing the drink; but, we are told, &quot;he knew he would not throw the drink&quot; because he was in financial debt to Harry and because &quot;people would say he was sore because Reilly ... was elaborately attentive to Caroline English&quot;. The narrator&#x27;s vision shifts elsewhere, and several pages later we are surprised to hear a character report &quot;Jeezozz H. Kee-rist! Julian English just threw a highball in Harry Reilly&#x27;s face!&quot;

The second event occurs at a roadhouse, where Julian goes with his wife and some friends. Julian gets drunk and invites a provocatively clad woman to go out to his car with him. The woman is, in fact, a gangster&#x27;s girlfriend, and one of the gangster&#x27;s men is present, sent to watch her. Both Julian&#x27;s wife and the gangster&#x27;s aide see the couple leave. What actually happens in the car is left ambiguous, but that is unimportant, since all observers assume that sexual congress has ensued. There is not any assumption that violence will ensue. However, the gangster is a valued automobile customer who in the past has recommended Julian&#x27;s dealership to his acquaintances. As Julian is driven home, pretending to be asleep, he &quot;felt the tremendous excitement, the great thrilling lump in the chest and abdomen that comes before the administering of an unknown, well-deserved punishment. He knew he was in for it.&quot;

Third, the next day, during lunch at the Lantenengo Club, Julian engages in a complicated brawl with a one-armed war veteran named Froggy Ogden, who is also Caroline&#x27;s cousin. Julian thought of Froggy as an old friend, but Froggy acknowledges to Julian that he has always detested him and had not wanted his cousin Caroline to marry him. In the brawl, which Froggy has arguably started, Julian hits Froggy and at least one of a group of bystanders in the club.

He experiences two suicidal daydreams that oddly contrast with each other. In the first of the two dreams, after Caroline&#x27;s temporary departure, he places a gun in his mouth:

He does not, however, commit suicide at that time. His second suicidal reverie is after a failed attempt to seduce a woman, the local society reporter. He believes that, as a result of his behavior and of the community&#x27;s sympathy for Caroline, &quot;no girl in Gibbsville—worth having—would risk the loss of reputation which would be her punishment for getting herself identified with him.&quot; He believes that even if he divorces Caroline, he is destined to spend the rest of his life hearing:

After this and other indications that he had mis-gauged his social status, he commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, running his car in a closed garage.

==Analysis==
O&#x27;Hara biographer Frank MacShane writes &quot;The excessiveness of Julian&#x27;s suicide is what makes &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; so much a part of its time. Julian doesn&#x27;t belong to Fitzgerald&#x27;s Jazz Age; he is ten years younger and belongs to what came to be called the hangover generation, the young people who grew up accustomed to the good life without having to earn it. This is the generation that had so little to defend itself with when the depression came in 1929.&quot;

===Frank treatment of sexuality===
O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s books tended to push the limits of what was considered tolerable in a mainstream novel. His second, &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;, was notorious and was banned from importation into Australia until 1963. But &quot;Appointment In Samarra&quot; was controversial too. Biographer Geoffrey Wolff quotes a &quot;Saturday Review&quot; article by Yale University professor Henry Seidel Canby, entitled &quot;Mr. O&#x27;Hara and the Vulgar School&quot;, and also cites Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s denunciation of the book&#x27;s sensuality as &quot;nothing but infantilism – the erotic visions of a behind the barn.&quot;

Most of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s descriptions of sexuality are indirect: &quot;There was the time Elinor Holloway ... shinnied half way up the flagpole while five young gentlemen, standing at the foot of the pole, verified the suspicion that Elinor, who had not always lived in Gibbsville, was not naturally, or at least not entirely, a blonde.&quot; However, passages like the following were quite unusual for the time:

In 2011, the book was placed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of top 100 novels written in English since 1923.

<doc id="790954" wikidata="Q1294039" url="?curid=790954" title="Eric Douglas">
<text>Eric Anthony Douglas (June 21, 1958 – July 6, 2004) was an American actor and stand-up comedian. He was the youngest son of actor Kirk Douglas and his second wife Anne Buydens. His half-brother was actor and producer Michael Douglas. Douglas pursued a career in show business but did not attain the same level of success as his father and siblings. His career was overshadowed by his numerous run-ins with the law and problems with alcohol and drugs.

== Early life and education ==
Douglas was born in Los Angeles, California, the youngest son of actor Kirk Douglas (1916–2020) and German American mother Anne Buydens (1919–2021). His father was Jewish and his mother later converted to Judaism. He was the younger brother of Peter Douglas, and his older half-brothers are Michael and Joel Douglas.

Douglas studied at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, and RADA and LAMDA, both in London.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Douglas made his screen debut in 1971 in &quot;A Gunfight&quot;, starring his father and Johnny Cash. In 1982, Douglas appeared in the NBC television film &quot;Remembrance of Love&quot;, also starring his father. Douglas portrayed a younger version of his father&#x27;s character in flashback scenes. He appeared in several films in the 1980s including &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; (1985), &quot;Tomboy&quot; (1985), &quot;The Golden Child&quot; (1986), and &quot;Honor Bound&quot; (1988). In the late 1980s, Douglas performed off-Broadway at the Village Gate Theater with the critically acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe Noo Yawk Tawk . He also appeared in a production of Dale Wasserman&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare and The Indians&quot; at the Music Theatre Conference for the Eugene O&#x27; Neill Theatre Center in 1981. Also in the production was folk performer Bobby Bridger, but the production never made it to Broadway.

In 1991, Douglas appeared with his father (in the senior Douglas&#x27;s Emmy-nominated performance) in &quot;Yellow&quot;, the Season 3 finale of the television series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. The father and son acting duo portrayed father and son characters with Eric a young officer in World War I brought up on charges of cowardice by his commanding general who is also his cold-hearted father.

=== Stand-up comedy ===
In the early 1990s, Douglas attempted a career as a stand-up comedian. He performed in New York City comedy clubs with much of his self-deprecating material coming from his status as the black sheep of the Douglas dynasty.

Douglas entered British comedy folklore when, during a stand-up performance at The Comedy Store, London, he was angered by the audience&#x27;s reaction to his stand-up routine. In a moment that would lead to club co-founder Don Ward saying he had , Douglas shouted &quot;You can&#x27;t do this to me, I&#x27;m Kirk Douglas&#x27;s son!&quot; A member of the audience then stood up and shouted, &quot;No, I&#x27;m Kirk Douglas&#x27; son,&quot; referring to the iconic &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus&quot; scene of the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas. This ended up with the majority of the audience standing up and repeating the line.

== Personal life ==
=== Legal issues ===
Douglas was arrested multiple times throughout the 1990s. One of his first arrests came in 1991 for kicking a Beverly Hills police officer. On October 30, 1994, Douglas was arrested in Los Angeles for cocaine possession. Less than a month later, he was arrested for DUI and for leaving the scene of an accident when he crashed into a parked car while trying to leave The Comedy Store in West Hollywood after a fight. In May 1996, Douglas was arrested for possession of a controlled substance when police found eleven vials of crack cocaine and 1,085 Xanax pills in his Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan apartment. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was placed on probation and was ordered to complete a drug rehab program.

In August 1996, he was arrested in Long Beach, California, for driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Two days later, Douglas was arrested in New Canaan, Connecticut, for disorderly conduct after he attempted to kiss a young girl who was a fellow patient at Silver Hill Hospital, a rehab facility he was in at the time. He was cleared of the charges in February 1998. In February 1997, Douglas was arrested for DUI after crashing his rental car into two parked cars.

=== Drug issues ===
In 2000, Douglas revealed in an interview that he went into an eight-day coma in 1999 after accidentally overdosing on Xanax. Douglas recalled, &quot;I was in L.A. sitting around my breakfast table with my dad and I choked on a piece of sausage. But because the pills had taken effect, I was not able to dislodge the sausage from my throat.&quot; After the Douglases&#x27; maid attempted the Heimlich maneuver, Douglas was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he fell into a coma. Due to an anoxic brain injury, his speech became slurred and his gait was altered.

In May 2001, Douglas sued his former psychiatrist, Dr. William Leader, claiming that Leader prescribed him a combination of prescription drugs that are lethal when combined with alcohol. Douglas asserted that Leader, who had been treating Douglas for his drug addictions for ten years, failed to consider his alcohol problem when he prescribed Vicodin, Klonopin, and Xanax. Douglas claimed the drugs caused him to feel suicidal and also caused an episode of cardiac arrest which led him to require constant care and hospitalization. Douglas sought $50,000 in damages from Leader.

Weeks before his death, Douglas was back in a rehab center in Upstate New York. His parents reportedly visited him and gave him a tough love ultimatum regarding his drug use.

In 2009, during an appearance on &quot;The Early Show&quot;, Kirk Douglas told interviewer Julie Chen that he and his wife had taken Eric to &quot;20 rehab centers&quot; over the years and that &quot;nothing helped&quot;.

== Death ==
On July 6, 2004, a maid found Douglas&#x27;s body in his Manhattan apartment. An autopsy and toxicology report later determined that his death was caused by &quot;acute intoxication&quot; from the combined effects of alcohol, tranquilizers, and painkillers. Douglas&#x27;s death was ruled accidental. He was interred in Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, California. His father was later interred with him in 2020 and his mother was interred with them in 2021.

<doc id="790967" wikidata="Q708693" url="?curid=790967" title="Hepatitis C virus">
<text>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (55–65 nm in size), enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;. The hepatitis C virus is the cause of hepatitis C and some cancers such as liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, abbreviated HCC) and lymphomas in humans.

==Taxonomy==
The hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus &quot;Hepacivirus&quot;, a member of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;. Before 2011, it was considered to be the only member of this genus. However a member of this genus has been discovered in dogs: canine hepacivirus. There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses. Several additional viruses in the genus have been described in bats and rodents.

==Structure==

The hepatitis C virus particle consists of a lipid membrane envelope that is 55 to 65 nm in diameter. Two viral envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope. They take part in viral attachment and entry into the cell. Within the envelope is an icosahedral core that is 33 to 40 nm in diameter. Inside the core is the RNA material of the virus.

=== E1 and E2 glycoproteins ===

E1 and E2 are covalently bonded when embedded in the envelope of HCV and are stabilized by disulfide bonds. E2 is globular and seems to protrude 6 nm out from the envelope membrane according to electron microscope images.

These glycoproteins play an important role in the interactions hepatitis C has with the immune system. A hypervariable region, the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) can be found on the E2 glycoprotein. HVR1 is flexible and quite accessible to surrounding molecules. HVR1 helps E2 shield the virus from the immune system. It prevents CD81 from latching onto its respective receptor on the virus. In addition, E2 can shield E1 from the immune system. Although HVR1 is quite variable in amino acid sequence, this region has similar chemical, physical, and conformational characteristics across many E2 glycoproteins.

==Genome==

Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is 9,600 nucleotide bases long. This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins. This is why on publicly available databases, such as the European Bioinformatics Institute, the viral proteome only consists of 2 proteins.

At the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA are the untranslated regions (UTR), that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5′ UTR has a ribosome binding site or internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that initiates the translation of a very long protein containing about 3,000 amino acids. The core domain of the HCV IRES contains a four-way helical Holliday junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot. The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frame&#x27;s orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. The large pre-protein is later cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into the 10 smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell, or assemble into the mature viral particles. Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include Core protein, E1 and E2; nonstructural proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.

==Molecular biology==
The proteins of this virus are arranged along the genome in the following order: N terminal-core-envelope (E1)–E2–p7-nonstructural protein 2 (NS2)–NS3–NS4A–NS4B–NS5A–NS5B–C terminal. The mature nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B) generation relies on the activity of viral proteinases. The NS2/NS3 junction is cleaved by a metal-dependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3. The remaining cleavages downstream from this site are catalysed by a serine protease also contained within the N-terminal region of NS3.
* The core protein has 191 amino acids and can be divided into three domains on the basis of hydrophobicity: domain 1 (residues 1–117) contains mainly basic residues with two short hydrophobic regions; domain 2 (residues 118–174) is less basic and more hydrophobic and its C-terminus is at the end of p21; domain 3 (residues 175–191) is highly hydrophobic and acts as a signal sequence for E1 envelope protein.
* Both envelope proteins (E1 and E2) are highly glycosylated and important in cell entry. E1 serves as the fusogenic subunit and E2 acts as the receptor binding protein. E1 has 4–5 N-linked glycans and E2 has 11 N-glycosylation sites.
* NS1 (p7) protein is dispensable for viral genome replication but plays a critical role in virus morphogenesis. This protein is a 63 amino acid membrane-spanning protein which locates itself in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cleavage of p7 is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum&#x27;s signal peptidases. Two transmembrane domains of p7 are connected by a cytoplasmic loop and are oriented towards the endoplasmic reticulum&#x27;s lumen.
* NS2 protein is a 21–23 kilodalton (kDa) transmembrane protein with protease activity.
* NS3 is 67 kDa protein whose N-terminal has serine protease activity and whose C-terminal has NTPase/helicase activity. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a heterodimeric complex with NS4A—a 54 amino acid membrane protein that acts as a cofactor of the proteinase.
* NS4A—a 54 amino acid membrane protein that acts as a cofactor of the proteinase.
* NS4B is a small (27 kDa) hydrophobic integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and plays an important role for recruitment of other viral proteins. It induces morphological changes to the endoplasmic reticulum forming a structure termed the membranous web.
* NS5A is a hydrophilic phosphoprotein which plays an important role in viral replication, modulation of cell signaling pathways and the interferon response. It is known to bind to endoplasmic reticulum-anchored human VAP proteins.
* The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key function of replicating the HCV&#x27;s viral RNA by using the viral positive sense RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined based on the same consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4&#x27;s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.

An 11th protein has also been described. This protein is encoded by a +1 frameshift in the capsid gene. It appears to be antigenic but its function is unknown.

==Replication==
Replication of HCV involves several steps. The virus replicates mainly in the hepatocytes of the liver, where it is estimated that daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty virions (virus particles) with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated. The virus may also replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, potentially accounting for the high levels of immunological disorders found in chronically infected HCV patients. In the liver, the HCV particles are brought into the hepatic sinusoids by blood flow. These sinusoids neighbor hepatocyte cells. HCV is able to pass through the endothelium of the sinusoids and make its way to the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte cells.

HCV has a wide variety of genotypes and mutates rapidly due to a high error rate on the part of the virus&#x27; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The mutation rate produces so many variants of the virus it is considered a quasispecies rather than a conventional virus species. Entry into host cells occur through complex interactions between virions, especially through their glycoproteins, and cell-surface molecules CD81, LDL receptor, SR-BI, DC-SIGN, Claudin-1, and Occludin.

The envelope of HCV is similar to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Because of this similarity, the virus is thought to be able to associate with apolipoproteins. It could surround itself with lipoproteins, partially covering up E1 and E2. Recent research indicates that these apolipoproteins interact with scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1). SR-B1 is able to remove lipids from the lipoproteins around the virus to better allow for HVR1 contact. Claudin 1, which is a tight-junction protein, and CD81 link to create a complex, priming them for later HCV infection processes. As the immune system is triggered, macrophages increase the amount of TNF-α around the hepatocytes which are being infected. This triggers the migration of occludin, which is another tight-junction complex, to the basolateral membrane. The HCV particle is ready to enter the cell.

These interactions lead to the endocytosis of the viral particle. This process is aided by clathrin proteins. Once inside an early endosome, the endosome and the viral envelope fuse and the RNA is allowed into the cytoplasm.

HCV takes over portions of the intracellular machinery to replicate. The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3,011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an alternate reading frame protein (ARFP). HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes place via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles.

The virus replicates on intracellular lipid membranes. The endoplasmic reticulum in particular is deformed into uniquely shaped membrane structures termed &#x27;membranous webs&#x27;. These structures can be induced by sole expression of the viral protein NS4B. The core protein associates with lipid droplets and utilises microtubules and dyneins to alter their location to a perinuclear distribution. Release from the hepatocyte may involve the VLDL secretory pathway. Another hypothesis states that the viral particle may be secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum through the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. This pathway is normally utilized to bud vesicles out of the cell. The only limitation to this hypothesis is that the pathway is normally used for cellular budding, and it is not known how HCV would commandeer the ESCRT pathway for use with the endoplasmic reticulum.

==Genotypes==

Based on genetic differences between HCV isolates, the hepatitis C virus species is classified into six genotypes (1–6) with several subtypes within each genotype (represented by lowercase letters). Subtypes are further broken down into quasispecies based on their genetic diversity. Genotypes differ by 30–35% of the nucleotide sites over the complete genome. The difference in genomic composition of subtypes of a genotype is usually 20–25%. Subtypes 1a and 1b are found worldwide and cause 60% of all cases.

===Clinical importance===

Genotype is clinically important in determining potential response to interferon-based therapy and the required duration of such therapy. Genotypes 1 and 4 are less responsive to interferon-based treatment than are the other genotypes (2, 3, 5 and 6). The duration of standard interferon-based therapy for genotypes 1 and 4 is 48 weeks, whereas treatment for genotypes 2 and 3 is completed in 24 weeks. Sustained virological responses occur in 70% of genotype 1 cases, ~90% of genotypes 2 and 3, ~65% of genotype 4 and ~80% of genotype 6. In addition, people of African descent are much less likely to respond to treatment when infected with genotypes 1 or 4. The substantial proportion of this lack of response to treatment is proposed to be caused by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 19 of the human genome that is predictive of treatment success. HCV genotypes 1 and 4 have been distributed endemically in overlapping areas of West and Central Africa, infecting for centuries human populations carrying the genetic polymorphism in question. This has prompted scientists to suggest that the protracted persistence of HCV genotypes 1 and 4 in people of African origin is an evolutionary adaptation of HCV over many centuries to these populations’ immunogenetic responses.

Infection with one genotype does not confer immunity against others, and concurrent infection with two strains is possible. In most of these cases, one of the strains outcompetes the other in a short time. This finding may be useful in treatment, in replacing strains non-responsive to medication with others easier to treat.

===Recombination===

When two viruses infect the same cell, genetic recombination may occur. Although infrequent, HCV recombination has been observed between different genotypes, between subtypes of the same genotype and even between strains of the same subtype.

==Epidemiology==

Hepatitis C virus is predominantly a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of this mode of spread the key groups at risk are intravenous drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for HCV, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropics, where people receive large number of insect bites.

==Evolution==
Identification of the origin of this virus has been difficult but genotypes 1 and 4 appear to share a common origin.
A Bayesian analysis suggests that the major genotypes diverged about 300–400 years ago from the common ancestor virus. The minor genotypes diverged about 200 years ago from their major genotypes. All of the extant genotypes appear to have evolved from genotype 1 subtype 1b.

A study of genotype 6 strains suggests an earlier date of evolution: approximately 1,100 to 1,350 years Before Present. The estimated rate of mutation was 1.8 × 10−4. An experimental study estimated the mutation rate at 2.5–2.9 × 10−3 base substitutions per site per year. This genotype may be the ancestor of the other genotypes.

A study of European, US and Japanese isolates suggested that the date of origin of genotype 1b was approximately in the year 1925. The estimated dates of origin of types 2a and 3a were 1917 and 1943 respectively. The time of divergence of types 1a and 1b was estimated to be 200–300 years.

A study of genotype 1a and 1b estimated the dates of origin to be 1914–1930 for type 1a and 1911–1944 for type 1b. Both types 1a and 1b underwent massive expansions in their effective population size between 1940 and 1960. The expansion of HCV subtype 1b preceded that of subtype 1a by at least 16 years. Both types appear to have spread from the developed world to the developing world.

The genotype 2 strains from Africa can be divided into four clades that correlate with their country of origin: (1) Cameroon and Central African Republic (2) Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso (3) Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal (4) Madagascar.
There is also strong evidence for the dissemination of HCV genotype 2 from West Africa to the Caribbean by the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

Genotype 3 is thought to have its origin in South East Asia.

These dates from these various countries suggests that this virus may have evolved in South East Asia and was spread to West Africa by traders from Western Europe. It was later introduced into Japan once that country&#x27;s self-imposed isolation was lifted. Once introduced to a country its spread has been influenced by many local factors including blood transfusions, vaccination programmes, intravenous drug use and treatment regimes. Given the reduction in the rate of spread once screening for HCV in blood products was implemented in the 1990s, it would seem that previously blood transfusion was an important method of spread. Additional work is required to determine the dates of evolution of the various genotypes and the timing of their spread across the globe.

==Vaccination==

Unlike hepatitis A and B, there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection.

==Current research==

The study of HCV has been hampered by the narrow host range of HCV. The use of replicons has been successful but these have only been recently discovered. HCV, as with most RNA viruses, exists as a viral quasispecies, making it very difficult to isolate a single strain or receptor type for study.

Current research is focused on small-molecule inhibitors of the viral protease, RNA polymerase and other nonstructural genes. Two agents—boceprevir by Merck and telaprevir by Vertex Pharmaceuticals—both inhibitors of NS3 protease were approved for use on May 13, 2011, and May 23, 2011, respectively.

A possible association between low Vitamin D levels and a poor response to treatment has been reported. &quot;In vitro&quot; work has shown that vitamin D may be able to reduce viral replication. While this work looks promising the results of clinical trials are pending. However, it has been proposed that vitamin D supplementation is important in addition to standard treatment, in order to enhance treatment response.

Naringenin, a flavonoid found in grapefruit and other fruits and herbs, has been shown to block the assembly of intracellular infectious viral particles without affecting intracellular levels of the viral RNA or protein.

Other agents that are under investigation include nucleoside and nucleotide analogue inhibitors and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibitors of NSP5A, and host-targeted compounds such as cyclophilin inhibitors and silibinin.

Sofosbuvir for use against chronic hepatitis C infection was approved by the FDA on December 6, 2013. It has been reported to be the first drug that has demonstrated safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for co-administration of interferon. On November 22, the FDA approved simeprevir for use in combination with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin. Simeprevir has been approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, genotype 1.

There is also current experimental research on non drug related therapies. Oxymatrine, for example, is a root extract found in the continent of Asia that has been reported to have antiviral activity against HCV in cell cultures and animal studies. Small and promising human trials have shown beneficial results and no serious side effects, but they were too small to generalize conclusions.

On October 5, 2020, it was announced that Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton, and Charles M. Rice had been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of HCV.

<text>Lesbian feminism is a cultural movement and critical perspective that encourages women to focus their efforts, attentions, relationships, and activities towards their fellow women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. Lesbian feminism was most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s, primarily in North America and Western Europe, but began in the late 1960s and arose out of dissatisfaction with the New Left, the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, sexism within the gay liberation movement, and homophobia within popular women&#x27;s movements at the time. Many of the supporters of Lesbianism were actually women involved in gay liberation who were tired of the sexism and centering of gay men within the community and lesbian women in the mainstream women&#x27;s movement who were tired of the homophobia involved in it.

Some key thinkers and activists include Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Cheryl Clarke, Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Cherríe Moraga, Monique Wittig, and Sara Ahmed (although the last two are more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory).

As stated by lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, &quot;Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the Women&#x27;s liberation movement began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the Gay Liberation Front left to join up with their sisters&quot;. According to Judy Rebick, a leading Canadian journalist and feminist activist, lesbians were and always have been &quot;the heart of the women&#x27;s movement&quot;, while their issues were &quot;invisible&quot; in the same movement.

Lesbian feminism of color emerged as a response to lesbian feminism thought that failed to incorporate the issues of class and race as sources of oppression along with heterosexuality.

== Key ideas ==
Lesbian feminism, much like feminism, lesbian and gay studies, and queer theory, is characterized by the ideas of contestation and revision. At the same time, one of the key themes of lesbian feminism is the analysis of heterosexuality as an institution. Lesbian feminist texts work to denaturalise heterosexuality and, based on this denaturalization, to explore heterosexuality&#x27;s &quot;roots&quot; in institutions such as patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism. Additionally, lesbian feminism advocates lesbianism as a rational result of alienation and dissatisfaction with these institutions.

Sheila Jeffreys defines lesbian feminism as having seven key themes:
* An emphasis on women&#x27;s love for one another
* Separatist organizations
* Community and ideas
* Idea that lesbianism is about &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;resistance&quot;
* Idea that the personal is political
* A rejection of social hierarchy
* A critique of male supremacy

Lesbian feminist literary critic Bonnie Zimmerman frequently analyzes the language used by writers from within the movement, often drawing from autobiographical narratives and the use of personal testimony. According to Zimmerman, lesbian feminist texts tend to be expressly non-linear, poetic and even obscure.

Lesbian feminists of color argue for intersectionality, in particular the crossings of gender, sex, class, and race, emphasizing that most research and data about sexual orientation is provided by white cis males.

=== Biology, choice and social constructionism ===
As outlined above, lesbian feminism typically situates lesbianism as a form of resistance to &quot;man-made&quot; institutions. Cheryl Clarke writes in her essay &quot;New Notes on Lesbianism&quot;:I name myself &quot;lesbian&quot; because this culture oppresses, silences, and destroys lesbians, even lesbians who don&#x27;t call themselves &quot;lesbians.&quot; I name myself &quot;lesbian&quot; because I want to be visible to other black lesbians. I name myself &quot;lesbian&quot; because I do not subscribe to predatory/institutionalized heterosexuality.However, according to &quot;A Dictionary of Gender Studies&quot;, some lesbians who believed themselves to be &#x27;born that way&#x27; considered political lesbians or those who believe lesbianism is a choice based on the institutionalized heterosexuality were appropriating the term &#x27;lesbian&#x27; and not experiencing or speaking out against the oppression that those women experience. Additionally, some feminists argue that &quot;political lesbianism,&quot; which reduces lesbianism as a political choice to reject men and the penises, overlooks the deeply personal nature of lesbianism as an expression of attraction between women and erases the experiences of trans women and their lesbian partners. 

=== Separatism ===
Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy and as a lifelong practice, but mostly the latter. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women&#x27;s relationships, and typically, limits their dealings with men.

Lesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s, as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the gay rights movement had anything to offer them. In 1970, seven women, including Del Martin, confronted the North Conference of Homophile [meaning homosexual] Organizations about the relevance of the gay rights movement to the women within it. The delegates passed a resolution in favor of women&#x27;s liberation, but Martin felt they had not done enough and wrote &quot;If That&#x27;s All There Is&quot;, an influential 1970 essay in which she decried gay rights organizations as sexist. In the summer of 1971, a lesbian group calling themselves &quot;The Furies&quot; formed a commune open to lesbians only, where they put out a monthly newspaper. &quot;The Furies&quot; consisted of twelve women, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all white, with three children among them. They shared chores and clothes, lived together, held some of their money in common, and slept on mattresses on a common floor. They also started a school to teach women auto and home repair so they would not be dependent on men. The newspaper lasted from January 1972 to June 1973; the commune itself ended in 1972.

Charlotte Bunch, an early member of &quot;The Furies&quot;, viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a &quot;first step&quot; period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance personal growth. Other lesbians, such as Lambda Award winning author Elana Dykewomon, have chosen separatism as a lifelong practice.

In addition to advocating withdrawal from working, personal or casual relationships with men, &quot;The Furies&quot; recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate &quot;only (with) women who cut their ties to male privilege&quot; and suggested that &quot;as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits&quot;.

This was part of a larger idea that Bunch articulated in &quot;Learning from Lesbian Separatism&quot;, that &quot;in a male-supremacist society, heterosexuality is a political institution&quot; and the practice of separatism is a way to escape its domination. For The Furies, lesbianism was the only path towards liberation from male supremacy and was seen as more of a political tool rather than a sexual preference.

In her 1988 book, &quot;Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value&quot;, lesbian philosopher Sarah Lucia Hoagland alludes to lesbian separatism&#x27;s potential to encourage lesbians to develop healthy community ethics based on shared values. Hoagland articulates a distinction (originally noted by Lesbian Separatist author and anthologist Julia Penelope) between a &quot;lesbian subculture&quot; and a &quot;lesbian community&quot;; membership in the subculture being &quot;defined in negative terms by an external, hostile culture&quot;, and membership in the community being based on &quot;the values we believe we can enact here&quot;.

Bette Tallen believes that lesbian separatism, unlike some other separatist movements, is &quot;not about the establishment of an independent state, it is about the development of an autonomous self-identity and the creation of a strong solid lesbian community&quot;.

Lesbian historian Lillian Faderman describes the separatist impulses of lesbian feminism which created culture and cultural artifacts as &quot;giving love between women greater visibility&quot; in broader culture. Faderman also believes that lesbian feminists who acted to create separatist institutions did so to &quot;bring their ideals about integrity, nurturing the needy, self-determination and equality of labor and rewards into all aspects of institution-building and economics&quot;.

The practice of Lesbian separatism sometimes incorporates concepts related to queer nationalism and political lesbianism. Some individuals who identify as Lesbian separatists are also associated with the practice of Dianic paganism.

A womyn&#x27;s land is a women-only intentional community predominantly created, populated, and maintained by lesbian separatists.

Elsewhere, lesbian feminists have situated female separatism as quite a mainstream thing and have explored the mythology surrounding it. Marilyn Frye&#x27;s (1978) essay &quot;Notes on Separatism and Power&quot; is one such example. She posits female separatism as a strategy practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women&#x27;s refuges, electoral quotas or women&#x27;s studies programmes). She argues that it is only when women practice it, self-consciously &quot;as&quot; separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). On the other hand, male separatism (one might cite gentleman&#x27;s clubs, labour unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon.

Still, other lesbian feminists put forward a notion of &quot;tactical separatism&quot; from men, arguing for and investing in things like women&#x27;s sanctuaries and consciousness-raising groups, but also exploring everyday practices to which women may temporarily retreat or practice solitude from men and masculinity.

Margaret Sloan-Hunter compared lesbian separatism to black separatism. In her work &quot;Making Separatist Connections: The Issue is Woman Identification&quot; she stated:If Lesbian separatism fails it will be because women are so together that we will just exude woman identification wherever we go. But since sexism is much older than racism, it seems that we must for now embrace separatism, at least psychically, for health and consciousness sake. This is a revolution, not a public relations campaign, we must keep reminding ourselves.Some of the lesbian feminist groups, however, were skeptical of separatism. As such, a prominent black lesbian feminist group, the Combahee River Collective, stated that separatism is not a viable political strategy for them.

=== The woman-identified woman ===
If the founding of the lesbian feminist movement could be pinpointed to a specific moment, it would probably be May 1970, when Radicalesbians, a radical feminist activist group of 20 lesbians, including novelist Rita Mae Brown, took over the &quot;Second Congress to Unite Women&quot;, a women&#x27;s conference in New York City. Uninvited, they lined up on stage wearing matching T-shirts inscribed with the words &quot;Lavender Menace&quot;, and demanded the microphone to read aloud their manifesto, &quot;The Woman-Identified Woman&quot;, which laid out the main precepts of their movement. Later on, Adrienne Rich incorporated this concept in her essay &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;, in which she unpacks the idea that patriarchy dictates women to be focused on men or to be &quot;men-identified women. Becoming women-identified women, i.e. changing the focus of attention and energy from men to women, is a way to resist the patriarchal oppression&quot;.

Contrary to some popular beliefs about &quot;man-hating butch dykes&quot;, lesbian feminist theory does not support the concept of female masculinity. Proponents like Sheila Jeffreys (2003:13) have argued that &quot;all forms of masculinity are problematic&quot;.

This is one of the principal areas in which lesbian feminism differs from queer theory, perhaps best summarized by Judith Halberstam&#x27;s quip that &quot;If Sheila Jeffreys didn&#x27;t exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.&quot;

=== Womyn&#x27;s culture ===
&quot;Womyn&quot; along with &quot;wimmin&quot; and &quot;womin&quot; were terms created by alliances within the lesbian feminist movement to distinguish them from men and masculine (or &quot;phallogocentric&quot;) language. The term &quot;women&quot; was seen as derivative of men and ultimately symbolized the prescriptive nature of women&#x27;s oppression. A new vocabulary emerged more generally, sometimes referencing lost or unspoken matriarchal civilizations, Amazonian warriors, ancient – especially Greek – goddesses, sometimes parts of the female anatomy and often references to the natural world. It was frequently remarked that the movement had nothing to go on, no knowledge of its roots, nor histories of lesbianism to draw on. Hence the emphasis on consciousness-raising and carving out new (arguably) &quot;gynocentric&quot; cultures.

Salsa Soul Sisters, Third World Wimmin Inc organization united lesbian feminists and womanists of color.

== Lesbians and mainstream feminism ==
As a critical perspective, lesbian feminism is perhaps best defined in opposition to mainstream feminism and queer theory. It has certainly been argued that mainstream feminism has been guilty of homophobia in its failure to integrate sexuality as a fundamental category of gendered inquiry and its treatment of lesbianism as a separate issue. In this respect, Adrienne Rich&#x27;s 1980 classic text &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot; is instructive and one of the landmarks in lesbian feminism.

=== Influence within feminist organizations ===
==== National Organization for Women (USA) ====
Lesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the National Organization for Women (NOW) was in 1969, when Ivy Bottini, an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of NOW, held a public forum titled &quot;Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?&quot;. However, NOW president Betty Friedan was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969, she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a &quot;lavender menace&quot; and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor Rita Mae Brown, and in 1970, she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Ivy Bottini, from NOW&#x27;s New York chapter. In response, on the first evening, when four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, a group of twenty women wearing T-shirts that read &quot;Lavender Menace&quot; came to the front of the room and faced the audience. One of the women then read the group&#x27;s declaration, &quot;The Woman-Identified Woman&quot;, the first major lesbian feminist statement. The group, who later named themselves &quot;Radicalesbians&quot;, were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms. In 1971, NOW passed a resolution that proclaimed &quot;a woman&#x27;s right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle&quot;, as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust. That year, NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers. In 1973, the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established.

Del Martin was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were the first lesbian couple to join the organization.

==== Old Lesbians Organizing for Change ====
In 2014, Old Lesbians Organizing for Change (OLOC) issued an &quot;Anti-Sexism Statement&quot; which states:Men run the world and women are supposed to serve according to the belief that men are superior to women, which is patriarchy. Patriarchy is the system by which men&#x27;s universal power is maintained and enforced. OLOC works toward the end of patriarchy and the liberation of all women.

=== Influence within governmental institutions ===
==== National Plan of Action of the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference (USA) ====
In November 1977 the National Women&#x27;s Conference issued a National Plan of Action, which stated in part:Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person&#x27;s sexual and affectional orientation.

=== Feminist culture ===
American photographer Deborah Bright created a series called &quot;Dream Girls&quot; which challenged mainstream gender-sex identities that the Hollywood industry in the 1980s chose to propagate.

== Tensions with queer theory and trans feminism ==
The emergence of queer theory in the 1990s built upon certain principles of lesbian feminism, including the critique of compulsory heterosexuality, the understanding of gender as defined in part by heterosexuality, and the understanding of sexuality as institutional instead of personal. Despite this, queer theory is largely set in opposition to traditional lesbian feminism. Whereas lesbian feminism is traditionally critical of BDSM, butch/femme identities and relationships, transgender and transsexual people, pornography, and prostitution, queer theory tends to embrace them. Queer theorists embrace gender fluidity and subsequently have critiqued lesbian feminism as having an essentialist understanding of gender that runs counter to their stated aims. Lesbian feminists have critiqued queer theory as implicitly male-oriented and a recreation of the male-oriented Gay Liberation Front that lesbian feminists initially sought refuge from. Queer theorists have countered by pointing out that the majority of the most prominent queer theorists are feminists and many (including Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, and Gayle Rubin) are, or have at one point identified as lesbians.

Barry (2002) suggests that in choosing between these possible alignments (lesbian feminism and/or queer theory) one must answer whether it is gender or sexuality that is the more &quot;fundamental in personal identity.&quot;

=== Views on butch/femme identities and relationships ===

Some lesbian feminists have argued that butch–femme is a replication of heterosexual relations, while other commentators argue that, while it resonates with heterosexual patterns of relating, butch–femme simultaneously challenges it.

In the 1970s, the development of lesbian feminism pushed butch–femme roles out of popularity. Lesbian separatists such as Sheila Jeffreys argued that all forms of masculinity, including masculine butch women, were negative and harmful to women. The group of radical lesbians often credited with sparking lesbian feminism, Radicalesbians, called butch culture &quot;male-identified role-playing among lesbians&quot;

While butch–femme roles had previously been the primary way of identifying lesbians and quantifying lesbian relationships in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, lesbian feminist ideology had turned these roles into a &quot;perversion of lesbian identity&quot;. Lesbian feminism was publicly represented though white feminism, and often excluded and alienated working class lesbians and lesbians of color. In these excluded communities, butch–femme roles persisted and grew throughout the 1970s. Despite the criticism from both middle-class lesbians and lesbian feminists, butch and femme roles reemerged in the 1980s and 1990s, but were no longer relegated to only working-class lesbians.

=== Views on BDSM ===
Because of its focus on equality in sexual relationships, lesbian feminism has traditionally been opposed to any form of BDSM that involve perpetuation of gender stereotypes. This view was challenged in the late 1970s, most notably by the Samois group, a San Francisco-based lesbian-feminist organization focused on BDSM. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing BDSM was entirely compatible with feminism, and held that the kind of feminist sexuality advocated by Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media was conservative and puritanical.

In contrast, many black lesbian feminists have spoken out against the practice of BDSM as racist. According to scholars Darlene Pagano, Karen Sims, and Rose Mason, sadomasochism, in particular, is a practice that often lacks sensitivity to the black female experience as it can be historically linked to similar forms of sexual violence and dominance enacted against black female slaves.

=== Views on bisexuality ===
Bisexuality is rejected by some lesbian feminists as being a reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism.

A bisexual woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine &quot;Common Lives/Lesbian Lives&quot;, alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.

A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian feminist activism came out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were &quot;deluded and desperate.&quot; However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a &quot;fashionable trend&quot; being promoted due to &quot;sexual hedonism&quot; and questioned whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.

Lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in &quot;The Lesbian Heresy&quot; (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to sexually harass women, bisexual men are just as likely to be troublesome to women as heterosexual men.

In contrast, &quot;Bi Any Other Name&quot; (1991), an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Kaʻahumanu considered one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, contains (among other things) the piece, &quot;Bisexuality: The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Lesbian Feminism?&quot;, by Beth Elliot.

=== Views on transgender people ===
Though lesbian feminists&#x27; views vary, there is a specific lesbian feminist canon which rejects the transgender rights movement, transsexuals and transvestites, positing transgender people as, at best, gender dupes or functions of a discourse on mutilation; or at worst, shoring up support for traditional and violent gender norms. This is a position marked by intense controversy. Sheila Jeffreys summarized the arguments on this topic in &quot;Unpacking Queer Politics&quot; (2003) and &quot;Gender Hurts&quot; (2014).

These views on transsexuality have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as transphobic and constituting hate speech against transsexual men and women.

Lesbian feminism is sometimes associated with opposition to sex reassignment surgery, as some lesbian feminist analyses see sex reassignment surgery as a form of violence akin to BDSM.

In 1979, lesbian feminist Janice Raymond published &quot;The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male&quot;. Controversial even today, it looked at the role of transsexualism – particularly psychological and surgical approaches to it – in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, the ways in which the medical-psychiatric complex is medicalizing &quot;gender identity&quot;, and the social and political context that has been instrumental in making transsexual treatment and surgery a normal and therapeutic medicine.

Raymond maintains that transsexualism is based on the &quot;patriarchal myths&quot; of &quot;male mothering,&quot; and &quot;making of woman according to man&#x27;s image.&quot; She claims this is done in order &quot;to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality,&quot; adding: &quot;All transsexuals rape women&#x27;s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.&quot; In her book, Raymond includes sections on Sandy Stone, a trans woman who had worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records, and Christy Barsky, accusing both of creating divisiveness in women&#x27;s spaces. These writings have been heavily criticized as personal attacks on these individuals.

In &quot;Living a Feminist Life&quot; (2017), Sara Ahmed imagines lesbian feminism as a fundamental and necessary alliance with trans feminism. Ahmed considered that an anti-trans stance is an anti-feminist stance, and against the feminist project of creating worlds to support those for whom gender fatalism (i.e. boys will be boys, girls will be girls) is deleterious.

== Lesbian of color feminism ==
Feminism among lesbians of color emerged as a response to the texts produced by white lesbian feminist authors in the late 1970s. Typically, lesbian feminism at the time failed to recognize issues related to intersectionality between race, gender, and class. Apart from this, lesbian feminists of color addressed the relationship between feminism as a movement and &quot;ideology of cultural nationalism or racial pride&quot;, as well as the differences found in the prevalent texts. Among the most influential lesbian feminists of color are Audre Lorde, Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Cherrie Moraga, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Kate Rushin, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Cheryl Clarke, and Ochy Curiel. Audre Lorde addressed how these movements should intersect in her 1979 speech &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;. In particular, she stated:As women, we have been taught either to ignore our differences, or to view them as causes for separation and suspicion rather than as forces for change. Without community there is no liberation, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between an individual and her oppression. But community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not exist.

=== Black lesbian feminism ===
Black lesbian feminism originates from black feminism and the civil rights movement in the beginning of the 1970s. Kaila Adia Story, a contemporary black lesbian feminist scholar, defines black lesbian feminism &quot;as the thought and praxis of an intersectional gendered and sexual analysis of the world&#x27;s relationship to queer women of color specifically, both cis and trans&quot;. The prominent authors who were at the roots of black lesbian feminism include Audre Lorde, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Kate Rushin, Doris Davenport, Cheryl Clarke, and Margaret Sloan-Hunter.

Black lesbian feminism emerged as a venue to address the issue of racism in the mainstream feminist movement, which was described as white, middle-class, and predominantly heterosexual. According to a 1979 statement by Barbara Smith, &quot;the reason racism is a feminist issue is easily explained by the inherent definition of feminism&quot;, which is &quot;the political theory and practice to free all women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women, as well as white economically privileged heterosexual women.&quot; Later, in 1984, she extended her views on black lesbian feminism mission to &quot;a movement committed to fighting sexual, racial, economic and heterosexist oppression, not to mention one which opposes imperialism, anti-Semitism, the oppressions visited upon the physically disabled, the old and the young, at the same time that it challenges militarism and imminent nuclear destruction is the very opposite of narrow.&quot;

Most prominent black lesbian feminists were writers rather than scholars and expressed their position in literary ways. Allida Mae Black states that unlike black feminism, in 1977 the position of black lesbian feminism was not as clear as the position of black feminism and was &quot;an allusion in the text&quot;. Apart from this, the position of black lesbian feminists was expressed in their interviews and public speeches. As such, in a 1980 interview published in &quot;The American Poetry Review&quot;, Audre Lorde stated that a &quot;true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women&quot;, as well as that all black women, whether they admit it or not, are lesbians because they are &quot;raised in the remnants of a basically matriarchal society&quot; and are still oppressed by patriarchy.

Pat Parker&#x27;s work reflected the oppression she suffered and observed in lives of other women. In her poem &quot;Have you Ever Tried to Hide&quot;, Parker calls out racism in the white feminist movement. In her multiple works, including the poem &quot;Womanslaughter&quot;, she drew attention to the violence Black women experience in their lives. Among others, Parker defended the idea of complex identities and stated that, for her, revolution will happen when all elements of her identity &quot;can come along&quot;.

==== Combahee River Collective ====
The Combahee River Collective is a Boston-based black feminist group that was formed as a radical alternative to the National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO) founded by Margaret Sloan-Hunter in 1973. For the organization&#x27;s members, NBFO lacked attention to the issues of sexuality and economic oppression. The Collective united the women that were dissatisfied with racism in white feminist movement and sexism in civil rights movement. The name of the organization alludes to the Underground Railroad Combahee River Raid that happened in 1863 under Harriet Tubman&#x27;s leadership and freed 750 slaves. The Combahee River Collective issued a statement in 1977 that described the organization&#x27;s vision as being opposed to all forms of oppression — including sexuality, gender identity, class, disability, and age oppression (later incorporated in the concept of intersectionality) that shaped the conditions on black women&#x27;s lives.

In its &quot;Statement&quot;, the Combahee River Collective defined itself as a left-wing organization leaning towards socialism and anti-imperialism. The organization also claimed that unlike some white feminist groups or NBFO, the Collective members are in &quot;solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization&quot; and emphasizing that &quot;the stance of Lesbian separatism ... is not a viable political analysis or strategy.&quot;

Other organizations under the stance of black lesbian feminism include Salsa Souls Sisters, formed in 1974 in New York City and considered to be the oldest black lesbian feminist organization; and Sapphire Sapphos, formed in 1979 in Washington, DC.

==== Visual art works ====
The more recent art form used to express black lesbian feminist ideas is film. In particular, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, an award-winning black lesbian feminist, made &quot;NO! The Rape Documentary&quot; (2006), a documentary that explores how rape is used as a weapon of homophobia. For Simmons, a sexual assault survivor herself, the film was also an exploration of how rape impacted her Black feminist lesbian journey.

=== Chicana lesbian feminism ===
Chicana lesbian feminism emerged from the Chicana feminism movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, Chicana feminism began to form as a &quot;social movement aimed to improve the position of Chicanas in American society.&quot; Chicanas separated from the Chicano movement began drawing their own political agendas, and started to question their traditional female roles. Specifically, Chicana feminists (see also Chicana literature) started addressing the forces that affected them as women of color and fighting for social equality.

In &quot;With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians&quot; (2009), the first monograph dedicated to the work of Chicana lesbians, Catriona Rueda Esquibel stated &quot;Chicana lesbians are central to understanding Chicana/o communities, theories, and feminisms.&quot; Similarly to black lesbian feminists, Chicana lesbian feminists use literature as a way of naming themselves, expressing their ideas, and reclaiming their experiences flagged with a number of accusations. They are accused of being lesbians, of betraying society by denying men of their reproductive role, and of betraying their Chicana identity by adhering to feminist and lesbian ideologies, both things considered by Chicano culture as &quot;white&quot; notions. The key Chicana lesbian feminist thinkers include Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldúa, Lidia Tirado White, Alicia Gaspar de Alba, Emma Pérez, Carla Trujillo, Monica Palacios, Ana Castillo, Natashia López, and Norma Alarcón.

In the feminist anthology &quot;This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color&quot;, Moraga and Anzaldúa describe the Chicana lesbian feminist mission as follows: &quot;we attempt to bridge the contradictions in our experience. We are the colored in a white feminist movement. We are the feminists among the people of our culture. We are often the lesbians among the straight. We do this bridging by naming ourselves and by telling our stories in our own words.&quot;

One of the foundational concepts of Chicana lesbian feminist movement is &quot;theory in the flesh&quot;, which is &quot;flesh and blood experiences of the woman of color.&quot; Specifically, as described by Moraga and Anzaldúa, &quot;a theory in flesh means one where the typical realities of our lives —our skin color, the land or concrete we grew up on, our sexual belongings—all fuse to create a political born out of necessity.&quot; In Moraga&#x27;s article &quot;La Güera,&quot; she continues making reference to the theory in the flesh: &quot;it wasn&#x27;t until I acknowledged and confronted my own lesbianism in the flesh, that my heartfelt identification with and empathy for my mother&#x27;s oppression —due to being poor, uneducated, Chicana— was realized.&quot; Furthermore, this theory incorporates the ideas of finding strength in and celebrating each other&#x27;s difference as well as reinterpreting the history by &quot;shaping new myths&quot;, and lays in a process of naming themselves but also naming the enemies within oneself to break down paradigms. As Moraga explains in her prose &quot;Loving in the War Years: Lo que nunca paso por sus labios&quot;:In this country, lesbianism is a poverty — as is being brown, as is being a woman, as is being just plain poor. The danger lies in ranking the oppressions. The danger lies in failing to acknowledge the specificity of the oppression. The danger lies in attempting to deal with oppression purely from a theoretical base. Without an emotional, heartfelt grappling with the source of our own oppression, without naming the enemy within ourselves and outside of us, no authentic, non-hierarchical connection among oppressed groups can take place.

==== Genres and main themes ====
Chicana lesbian feminists challenge traditional forms of knowledge production, and introduce new ways of knowledge creation through new forms of writing. Many Chicana lesbian feminists use what Teresa de Lauretis named &quot;fiction/theory&quot;, &quot;a formally experimental, critical and lyrical, autobiographical and theoretically conscious, practice of writing-in-the-feminine that crosses genre boundaries (poetry and prose, verbal and visual modes, narrative and cultural criticism), and instates new correlations between signs and meanings.&quot; They combine genres such as autobiography, poetry, theory, personal diaries or imaginary interviews. At the same time, Chicana lesbian feminists today navigate and struggle across a variety of discursive contexts (as activist, academics, feminists, and artists).

Through their literature and art, Chicana lesbian feminists explore their body-lived experiences, a fundamental aspect in the construction of lesbian identity. They reclaim the idea of the real body and the physical aspect of it. Chicana lesbian feminists bring into the discussion the conflicts with the concept of &quot;la familia&quot;, the new &quot;familias&quot; they create, and their right to choose their own sexuality. Martha Barrera writes &quot;we are just as valid a &quot;familia&quot; as we would be if she were a brown man who I married in the Catholic Church.&quot; At the same time they try to find reconciliation with their &quot;familia&quot;. Juanita M. Sánchez writes:my father wanted me to go to work my grandmother wanted me to speak more Spanish she couldn&#x27;t speak English i wanted to make a living selling popsicles on my 1948 cushman scooter nothing turned out like they wanted but my mother did say, &quot;if you want to be with a woman, que le hace, as long as you&#x27;re happy&quot;.Chicana lesbian feminists confront their lesbian identity with their Chicano identity. This constitutes a central aspect of Chicana lesbian literature. Renée M. Martinez expresses her impossibility to reconcile the two identities: &quot;being a Chicana and a lesbian, my parents&#x27; daughter and a lesbian, alive and a lesbian&quot;, lesbianism &quot;would sever me from everything that counted in my life: homosexuality, the ultimate betrayal of my Mexican heritage, was only for white people.&quot; Moraga writes how:the woman who defies her role ... is purported to be a &quot;traitor to her race&quot; by contributing to the &quot;genocide&quot; of her people ... In short, even if the defiant woman is not a lesbian, she is purported to be one; for, like the lesbian in the Chicano imagination, she is una Malinchista. Like the Malinche of Mexican history, she is corrupted by foreign influences which threaten to destroy her people. ... Lesbianism can be construed by the race then as the Chicana being used by the white man, even if the man never lays a hand on her. The choice is never seen as her own. Homosexuality is his disease with which he sinisterly infects Third World people, men and women alike.

<text>Ruthe Lewin Winegarten (August 26, 1929 – June 14, 2004) was an American author, activist, and historian.

==Early life==
Born Ruthe Lee Lewin in Dallas on August 26, 1929, she was the daughter of Charles and Celia (Cohen) Lewin.

Winegarten attended Forest Avenue High School (known today as James Madison High School), receiving a scholarship to attend Southern Methodist University.

Lewin also attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in anthropology in 1950, and was active in helping to get the first black student admitted to the University of Texas Law School. She later earned a master&#x27;s degree in social work from the University of Texas at Arlington and did coursework for a doctorate in history at the University of Texas at Dallas.

==Career==
Before moving back to Austin, Texas in 1978, Winegarten worked for various social causes in Dallas, including serving as the southwest regional director of the Anti-defamation league of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, and as assistant director of the Jewish Welfare Federation in Dallas. She also was active in the North Dallas Democratic Women&#x27;s Club and performed in musical spoofs with future Texas Governor Ann Richards.

While researching a thesis paper in the 1970s at the University of Texas at Dallas, she compiled an oral history of Annie Mae Hunt. Later she and collaborators would edit these conversations, including Hunt&#x27;s recollections of her grandparents&#x27; histories of slavery, into a popular book, &quot;I am Annie Mae: A Black Texas Woman in Her Own Words&quot; and then subsequently into a musical drama.

After returning to Austin, Winegarten became director of Austin&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Center. In 1979, she was appointed as Curator of the Texas Women&#x27;s History Project, which developed the touring exhibit &quot;Texas Women: A Celebration of History&quot; (now housed at Texas Woman&#x27;s University). Later, Winegarten oversaw the addition of women to the exhibits in the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum in Austin.

Winegarten twice won the Liz Carpenter Award, for her books &quot;Black Texas Women: 150 Years of Trial and Triumph&quot;, and &quot;Capitol Women: Texas Female Legislators 1923–1999&quot; (with Nancy Baker Jones). The Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year by the Texas State Historical Association. Winegarten was made a fellow of the TSHA in 2003. She authored or co-authored a total of 18 books, primarily on subjects in Texas women&#x27;s history. The last of these was &quot;Las Tejanas: 300 years of History&quot; (with Teresa Palomo Acosta).

==Personal life==
Ruthe Lewin married Wendell Addington in 1948, Thomas W. Sanders in 1952, Alvin Winegarten in 1956, and Stanley Schneider in 1986. She bore three children, Martha Frances Addington, (1952–2007), Marc David Sanders (1954–2022), and Debra Lou Winegarten (1957– 2018).

==Death and legacy==
The Ruthe Winegarten Memorial Foundation for Women in Texas History, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, was started by a group of her colleagues to carry on her work. The Foundation&#x27;s website is: www.womenintexashistory.org.

Winegarten died in 2004, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She had been living at an assisted-living facility and was in the early stages of dementia.

<doc id="790999" wikidata="Q751641" url="?curid=790999" title="Hypersomnia">
<text>Hypersomnia is a neurological disorder of excessive time spent sleeping or excessive sleepiness. It can have many possible causes (such as seasonal affective disorder) and can cause distress and problems with functioning. In the fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5), hypersomnolence, of which there are several subtypes, appears under sleep-wake disorders.

Hypersomnia is a pathological state characterized by a lack of alertness during the waking episodes of the day. It is not to be confused with fatigue, which is a normal physiological state. Daytime sleepiness appears most commonly during situations where little interaction is needed.

Since hypersomnia impairs patients&#x27; attention levels (wakefulness), quality of life may be impacted as well. This is especially true for people whose jobs request high levels of attention, such as in the healthcare field.

This is not to be confused with clinophilia, a sleep disorder where a person intentionally refuses to get out of bed, regardless of a disease or not.

== Symptoms ==
The main symptom of hypersomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), or prolonged nighttime sleep, which has occurred for at least 3 months prior to diagnosis.

Sleep drunkenness is also a symptom found in hypersomniac patients. It is a difficulty transitioning from sleep to wake. Individuals experiencing sleep drunkenness report waking with confusion, disorientation, slowness and repeated returns to sleep.

It also appears in non-hypersomniac persons, for example after a night of insufficient sleep. Fatigue and consumption of alcohol or hypnotics can cause sleep drunkenness as well. It is also associated with irritability: people who get angry shortly before sleeping tend to experience sleep drunkenness.

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, hypersomniac patients often take long naps during the day that are mostly unrefreshing. Researchers found that naps are usually more frequent and longer in patients than in controls. Furthermore, 75% of the patients report that short naps are not refreshing either, compared to controls.

== Diagnosis ==
&quot;The severity of daytime sleepiness needs to be quantified by subjective scales (at least the Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and objective tests such as the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).&quot; The Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) is another frequently-used subjective measurement of sleepiness. After it is determined that excessive daytime sleepiness is present, a complete medical examination and full evaluation of potential disorders in the differential diagnosis (which can be tedious, expensive and time-consuming) should be undertaken.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Hypersomnia can be primary (of central/brain origin), or it can be secondary to any of numerous medical conditions. More than one type of hypersomnia can coexist in a single patient. Even in the presence of a known cause of hypersomnia, the contribution of this cause to the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness needs to be assessed. When specific treatments of the known condition do not fully suppress excessive daytime sleepiness, additional causes of hypersomnia should be sought. For example, if a patient with sleep apnea is treated with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which resolves their apneas but not their excessive daytime sleepiness, it is necessary to seek other causes for the excessive daytime sleepiness. Obstructive sleep apnea &quot;occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management.&quot;

==== Primary hypersomnias ====
The true primary hypersomnias include:

* Narcolepsy (with and without cataplexy)
* Idiopathic hypersomnia
* Recurrent hypersomnias (like Kleine-Levin syndrome)

==== Primary hypersomnia mimics ====

There are also several genetic disorders that may be associated with primary/central hypersomnia. These include the following: Prader-Willi syndrome; Norrie disease; Niemann–Pick disease, type C; and myotonic dystrophy. However, hypersomnia in these syndromes may also be associated with other secondary causes, so it is important to complete a full evaluation. Myotonic dystrophy is often associated with SOREMPs (sleep onset REM periods, such as occur in narcolepsy).

There are many neurological disorders that may mimic the primary hypersomnias, narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia: brain tumors; stroke-provoking lesions; clinophilia; and dysfunction in the thalamus, hypothalamus, or brainstem. Also, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, or multiple system atrophy are frequently associated with primary hypersomnia. However, in these cases, one must still rule out other secondary causes.

Early hydrocephalus can also cause severe excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, head trauma can be associated with a primary/central hypersomnia, and symptoms similar to those of idiopathic hypersomnia can be seen within 6–18 months following the trauma. However, the associated symptoms of headaches, memory loss, and lack of concentration may be more frequent in head trauma than in idiopathic hypersomnia. &quot;The possibility of secondary narcolepsy following head injury in previously asymptomatic individuals has also been reported.&quot;

==== Secondary hypersomnias ====
Secondary hypersomnias are extremely numerous.

Hypersomnia can be secondary to disorders such as clinical depression, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, epilepsy, or obesity. Hypersomnia can also be a symptom of other sleep disorders, like sleep apnea. It may occur as an adverse effect of taking certain medications, of withdrawal from some medications, or of substance use. A genetic predisposition may also be a factor. In some cases it results from a physical problem, such as a tumor, head trauma, or dysfunction of the autonomic or central nervous system.

Sleep apnea is the second most frequent cause of secondary hypersomnia, affecting up to 4% of middle-aged adults, mostly men. Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is a clinical variant of sleep apnea that can also cause hypersomnia. Just as other sleep disorders (like narcolepsy) can coexist with sleep apnea, the same is true for UARS. There are many cases of UARS in which excessive daytime sleepiness persists after CPAP treatment, indicating an additional cause, or causes, of the hypersomnia and requiring further evaluation.

Sleep movement disorders, such as restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD or PLMS) can also cause secondary hypersomnia. Although RLS does commonly cause excessive daytime sleepiness, PLMS does not. There is no evidence that PLMS plays &quot;a role in the etiology of daytime sleepiness. In fact, two studies showed no correlation between PLMS and objective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness. In addition, EDS in these patients is best treated with psychostimulants—and not with dopaminergic agents known to suppress PLMS.&quot;

Neuromuscular diseases and spinal cord diseases often lead to sleep disturbances due to respiratory dysfunction causing sleep apnea, and they may also cause insomnia related to pain. &quot;Other sleep alterations, such as periodic limb movement disorders in patients with spinal cord disease, have also been uncovered with the widespread use of polysomnography.&quot;

Primary hypersomnia in diabetes, hepatic encephalopathy, and acromegaly is rarely reported, but these medical conditions may also be associated with hypersomnia secondary to sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD).

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia can also be associated with hypersomnia. The CDC states that people with ME/CFS experience post-exertional malaise, fatigue, and sleep problems (among other symptoms). Polysomnography shows reduced sleep efficiency and may include alpha intrusion into sleep EEG. ME/CFS can be comorbid with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, PLMD, etc.

As with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia may be associated with anomalous alpha wave activity (typically associated with arousal states) during NREM sleep. Also, researchers have shown that disrupting stage IV sleep consistently in young, healthy subjects causes a significant increase in muscle tenderness—similar to that experienced in &quot;neurasthenic musculoskeletal pain syndrome&quot;. This pain resolved when the subjects were able to resume their normal sleep patterns.
Chronic kidney disease is commonly associated with sleep symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness. 80% of those on dialysis have sleep disturbances. Sleep apnea can occur 10 times as often in uremic patients than in the general population and can affect up to 30-80% of patients on dialysis, though nighttime dialysis can improve this. About 50% of dialysis patients have hypersomnia, as severe kidney disease can cause uremic encephalopathy, increased sleep-inducing cytokines, and impaired sleep efficiency. About 70% of dialysis patients are affected by insomnia, and RLS and PLMD affect 30%, though these may improve after dialysis or kidney transplant.

Most forms of cancer and their therapies can cause fatigue and disturbed sleep, affecting 25-99% of patients and often lasting for years after treatment completion. &quot;Insomnia is common and a predictor of fatigue in cancer patients, and polysomnography demonstrates reduced sleep efficiency, prolonged initial sleep latency, and increased wake time during the night.&quot; Paraneoplastic syndromes can also cause insomnia, hypersomnia, and parasomnias.

Autoimmune diseases, especially lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, are often associated with hypersomnia. Morvan&#x27;s syndrome is an example of a rarer autoimmune illness that can also lead to hypersomnia. Celiac disease is another autoimmune disease associated with poor sleep quality (which may lead to hypersomnia), &quot;not only at diagnosis but also during treatment with a gluten-free diet.&quot; There are also some case reports of central hypersomnia in celiac disease. And RLS &quot;has been shown to be frequent in celiac disease,&quot; presumably due to its associated iron deficiency.

Hypothyroidism and iron deficiency with or without (iron-deficiency anemia) can also cause secondary hypersomnia. Various tests for these disorders are done so they can be treated. Hypersomnia can also develop within months after viral infections such as Whipple&#x27;s disease, mononucleosis, HIV, and Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome must be considered in the differential diagnosis of secondary hypersomnia. This disorder occurs in individuals who fail to get sufficient sleep for at least three months. In this case, the patient has chronic sleep deprivation, although they may not necessarily be aware of it. This situation is becoming more prevalent in western society due to the modern demands and expectations placed upon the individual.

Many medications can lead to secondary hypersomnia. Therefore, a patient&#x27;s complete medication list should be carefully reviewed for sleepiness or fatigue as side effects. In these cases, careful withdrawal from the possibly offending medication(s) is needed; then, medication substitution can be undertaken.

Mood disorders, like depression, anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder, can also be associated with hypersomnia. The complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness in these conditions is often associated with poor sleep at night. &quot;In that sense, insomnia and EDS are frequently associated, especially in cases of depression.&quot; Hypersomnia in mood disorders seems to be primarily related to &quot;lack of interest and decreased energy inherent in the depressed condition rather than an increase in sleep or REM sleep propensity&quot;. In all cases with these mood disorders, the MSLT is normal (not too short and no SOREMPs).

==== Posttraumatic hypersomnias ====
In some cases, hypersomnia can be caused by a brain injury. Researchers found that the level of sleepiness is correlated with the severity of the injury. Even if patients reported an improvement, sleepiness remained present for a year in about a quarter of patients with traumatic brain injury.

====Recurrent hypersomnias====
Recurrent hypersomnias are defined by several episodes of hypersomnia persisting from a few days to weeks. These episodes can occur weeks or months apart from each other. There are 2 subtypes of recurrent hypersomnias: Kleine-Levin syndrome and menstrual-related hypersomnia.

Kleine-Levin syndrome is characterized by the association of episodes of hypersomnias with behavioral, cognitive and mood abnormalities. The behavioral disturbances can be composed of hyperphagia, irritability, or sexual disinhibition. The cognitive disorders consist of confusion, hallucinations or delusions. Mood symptoms are characterized by anxiety or depression.

Menstrual-related hypersomnia is characterized by episodes of excessive sleepiness associated with the menstrual cycle. Researchers found that the degree of premenstrual symptoms were correlated with daytime sleepiness. Unlike Kleine-Levin syndrome, hyperphagia and hypersexuality are not reported in people with menstrual-related hypersomnia, but hypophagia could be present. Ordinarily, these episodes appear 2 weeks before menstruation. A few studies have attested that some hormones as prolactin and progesterone could be responsible for Menstrual-Related Hypersomnia. Therefore, different contraceptive pills could improve the symptoms. The sleep architecture changes. There is a decrease of slow-wave sleep and an increase of slow-Theta-wave activity.

== Assessment tools ==

=== Polysomnography ===
Polysomnography is an objective sleep assessment method. It comprises a lot of electrodes which measure physiological variables related to sleep. Polysomnography often includes electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, muscle activity and respiratory function.

Polysomnography is helpful to identify the very short sleep onset latency period, the very efficient sleep (more than 90%), the increased slow wave sleep, and sometimes an elevated amount of sleep spindles in idiopathic hypersomnia patients.

=== Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) ===
The &#x27;multiple sleep latency test&#x27; (MSLT) is an objective tool which indicates the degree of sleepiness by measuring the sleep latency (i.e. the speed of falling asleep). It also gives information regarding the presence of abnormal REM sleep onset episodes. During that test, patients have a series of opportunities to sleep at 2-h intervals across the day in a darkened room and with no external alerting influences.

The MSLT is often administered the day after recording the polysomnography, and the mean sleep latency score is often found to be around (or less than) 8 minutes in idiopathic hypersomnia patients. Some patients might even have a sleep onset latency of 5 minutes or less. These patients are often even more aware of sleeping during naps than narcolepsy patients.

=== Actigraphy ===
Actigraphy, which operates by analyzing the patient&#x27;s limb movements, is used to record the sleep and wake cycles. In order to report them, the patient has to wear continuously a device on his or her wrist, which looks like a watch and does not contain any electrodes.
The advantage actigraphy shows over polysomnography is that it is possible to record for 24-hours a day for weeks. Furthermore, unlike the polysomnography, it is less expensive and non-invasive.

An actigraphy over several days can show longer sleep periods, which are characteristic for idiopathic hypersomnia. Actigraphy is also helpful in ruling out other sleep disorders, especially circadian disorders, leading to an excess of sleepiness during the day, too.

=== The maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) ===
The &#x27;maintenance of wakefulness test&#x27; (MWT) is a test that measures the ability to stay awake. It is used to diagnose disorders of excessive somnolence, such as hypersomnia, narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. During that test, patients sit comfortably and are instructed to try to stay awake.

===The Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS)===
The Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS) is a self-report scale that measures the different steps of sleepiness. For each statement, patients report their level of sleepiness using a 7-point scale, going from very alert to excessively sleepy. Researchers found that the SSS was highly correlated with performances to monotonous and boring tasks, which are found to be very sensitive to sleepiness. These results suggest that the SSS is a good tool to assess sleepiness in patients.

===The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)===
The &#x27;Epworth sleepiness scale&#x27; (ESS) is also a self-reported questionnaire that measures the general level of sleepiness in a day The patients have to rate specific daily situations by means of a scale going from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing). The results found in the ESS correlate with the sleep latency indicated by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test.

== Treatment ==
Although there has been no cure of chronic hypersomnia, there are several treatments that may improve patients&#x27; quality of life—depending on the specific cause or causes of hypersomnia that are diagnosed.

Because the causes of hypersomnia are unknown, it is only possible to treat symptoms and not directly the cause of this disorder. Behavioral treatments, as well as sleep hygiene, have to be discussed with the patient and are recommended.

There are several pharmacological agents that have been prescribed to patients with hypersomnia, but few have been found to be efficient. Modafinil has been found to be the most effective drug against the excessive sleepiness, and has even been shown to be helpful in children with hypersomnia. The dosage is started at 100 mg per day, and then slowly increased to 400 mg per day.

In general, patients with hypersomnia or excessive sleepiness should only go to bed to sleep or for sexual activity. All other activities, such as eating or watching television, should be done elsewhere. For those patients, it is also important to go to bed only when they feel tired, rather than trying to fall asleep for hours. In that case, they probably should get out of bed and read or watch television until they get sleepy.

== Epidemiology ==
Hypersomnia affects approximately 5% to 10% of the general population, &quot;with a higher prevalence for men due to the sleep apnea syndromes&quot;.

<text>Geoffrey Giuliano (born September 11, 1953) is an American actor and author.

== Early life ==
Giuliano was born on September 11, 1953, in Rochester, New York. He moved to Tampa, Florida, with his family when he was 12 years old, where he graduated from Plant High School and Hillsborough Community College. He later attended and graduated from SUNY Brockport.

==Literary work==
Giuliano has written extensively on popular music, particularly the Beatles. By 1999, he had authored 20 books, including &quot;Dark Horse: The Private Life of George Harrison&quot; (1990) and &quot;Blackbird: The Life and Times of Paul McCartney&quot; (1991). 

In an interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 1992, Giuliano referred to the Beatles as &quot;real shits in real life&quot; and dismissed Paul McCartney as &quot;just shallow and vacuous&quot;. On October 5 that year, George Harrison&#x27;s wife, Olivia Harrison responded, writing, &quot;like a starving dog he [Giuliano] scavenges his heroes, picking up bits of gristle and sinew along the way.&quot; She also complained about Giuliano&#x27;s use of a quote by Harrison on the cover of &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, saying: &quot;My husband once made the remark: &#x27;That guy knows more about my life than I do.&#x27; Giuliano missed the joke and used it to endorse his book.&quot; When interviewed in Los Angeles on December 14, 1992, Harrison said of Giuliano: &quot;Yeah, I met him briefly. I have no way of recalling what year it was. I met him at the home of &quot;Legs&quot; Larry Smith for possibly thirty minutes.&quot;

Giuliano&#x27;s biography of John Lennon, &quot;Lennon in America: 1971–1980&quot; (Cooper Square Press, 2000), was similarly controversial. Giuliano said the book was based in part on transcripts of Lennon&#x27;s diaries given to him by the late American singer Harry Nilsson and on audio tapes recorded by Lennon. Several people close to Nilsson said they did not believe that he ever had the transcripts in his possession; others familiar with the journal and the tapes disputed the accuracy of Giuliano&#x27;s interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaney/BuffaloNews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, David Segal described Giuliano&#x27;s text as &quot;a highly critical, luridly detailed account&quot;; he quoted Giuliano&#x27;s response when he was asked to corroborate his claim that Nilsson gave him the diaries: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m going to do things in an ethical manner.&quot; Steven Gutstein, a former New York assistant district attorney who read the diaries during an early 1980s larceny lawsuit, recalled that they contained &quot;a lot of philosophical musings combined with mundane details of everyday life&quot;. Colin Carlson of &quot;Library Journal&quot; said of &quot;Lennon in America&quot;, &quot;Non-fans will be put off by this image of Lennon as cad, drug addict, and paranoiac; this often sensationalized account is for voyeurs and fans with deconstructive tendencies and is one of the best, most detailed books available on this subject.&quot; Less impressed, a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewer commented, &quot;If Giuliano&#x27;s own double-talk isn&#x27;t enough to diminish this work&#x27;s credibility, his endless, voyeuristic descriptions of Lennon&#x27;s sexual encounters are.&quot;

The 2005 film &quot;Stoned: The Wild &amp; Wicked World of Brian Jones&quot; was partly based on Guiliano&#x27;s book &quot;Paint It Black: The Murder of Brian Jones&quot; (1994).

In December 2021, he wrote an audio book detailing his experiences acting in the 2021 South Korean series &quot;Squid Game&quot;, where he played &quot;VIP #4&quot;. The book was titled &quot;Surviving Squid Game, I Am VIP 4.&quot;

==Acting career ==

As a teenager, Giuliano joined the Tampa Community Theater, starring in productions of &quot;Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In the early 1980s, he starred in Burger King and McDonald&#x27;s commercials, playing Ronald McDonald in the latter. However, he later denounced his work in these commercials, stating that he had been “brainwashing...youngsters into doing wrong” and “selling out to concerns who make millions by murdering animals&quot; in his role as Ronald McDonald. He appeared in the documentary film &quot;McLibel&quot;, where he stated that working as Ronald McDonald felt like &quot;the man in the Third Reich who was propaganda minister&quot;. 

Giualiano played Captain Li in the 2005 film &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; and Siris in the 2012 film &quot;Scorpion King 3&quot;; both movies were filmed in Thailand, where he resides. In 2013, he also portrayed Karl Redbeard in the Malaysian action film &quot;Vikingdom&quot;. 

He played a Hong Kong mob boss in the 2020 South Korean zombie movie &quot;Peninsula&quot;. This role attracted the attention of the producers of the South Korean survival thriller series &quot;Squid Game&quot;, where he was cast as &quot;VIP #4&quot; in 2021. His role in the series earned him some recognition, leading him to write an audio book on his experiences on the set, titled &quot;Surviving Squid Game, I Am VIP 4.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Giuliano has been a vegetarian since 1972, and has advocated for vegetarianism and against fast food. He lives in Bangkok, Thailand with his son. He also has a daughter.

In March 2020, Giuliano and his son travelled to India for a &quot;spiritiual pilgrimage&quot;. Intending to stay in the country for two weeks, he only brought $2000 in cash with him. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to international flights to Thailand being cancelled, stranding the two in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Giuliano stated that the two soon ran out of money and were forced to survive on &quot;monkey nuts and bananas&quot; with no fresh clothes. Both of them were eventually able to return to Thailand on a humanitarian flight in October 2020. The incident attracted media coverage in both India and Thailand.

<doc id="791058" wikidata="Q311149" url="?curid=791058" title="Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)">
<text>Orestes (died 28 August 476) was a Roman general and politician of Pannonian ancestry. He joined the court of Attila the Hun in his native Pannonia, in which he reached a high position, becoming one of Attila&#x27;s most trusted men. Orestes also held considerable influence in the late Western Roman Empire. His son Romulus Augustulus became Roman Emperor of the West.

==Biography==
Born to a Roman aristocratic family from Pannonia Savia, Orestes was son of Tatulus, a pagan, and son-in-law to Romulus, who served as &quot;comes&quot; in the Western Roman Empire. After Pannonia was ceded to Attila the Hun, Orestes joined Attila&#x27;s court, becoming one of Attila&#x27;s intimate advisors and most trusted lieutenants, and reaching high position as a secretary (&quot;notarius&quot;) in 449 and 452. In 449 Attila sent him twice to Constantinople with ambassador Eslas.

In 475, Orestes was appointed &quot;magister militum&quot; and &quot;patricius&quot; by Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos. This proved to be a mistake on the part of Nepos. By 28 August 475, Orestes, at the head of the &quot;foederati&quot; levies, managed to take control of the government in Ravenna, which had been the de facto capital of the Western Roman Empire since 402. Julius Nepos fled without a fight to Dalmatia, where he would continue to reign until his assassination in 480. With the emperor far away, Orestes elevated his son Romulus as &quot;augustus&quot;, recognized by most historians as the last Western Roman emperor. He was nicknamed Augustulus, meaning &quot;little Augustus&quot;, as the emperor was only a child at the time he became emperor in 475.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Orestes&quot; was played by Andrew Pleavin in the 2001 miniseries &quot;Attila&quot;, which depicts his time in service of the Hunnic king.
*The character of &quot;Orestes&quot; was played by Iain Glen in the 2007 historical-fiction film &quot;The Last Legion&quot;, which shows the character during his period of rule in Rome, although the film deviates significantly from the historical record of these events.
* &quot;Orestes&quot; is portrayed as the primary villain in Michael Curtis Ford&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fall of Rome&quot;.

<text>The Kamov Ka-22 &quot;Vintokryl&quot; (rotor-wing, or literally, (air)screw-wing) (Cyrillic: Камов Ка-22 Винтокрыл) (NATO reporting name: Hoop) was a rotorcraft developed by Kamov for the Soviet Air Force. The experimental transport aircraft combined the capabilities of a helicopter for vertical take-off and landing with those of a fixed-wing aircraft for cruise. The Ka-22 carried a large payload, having a hold comparable in size to the Antonov An-12. Eight world records for altitude and speed were set by the Ka-22 in its class, none of which have since been broken.

==Development==
In order to increase the effective range of a helicopter, Kamov designer Vladimir Barshevsky drew up a design for a helicopter with wings and an aeroplane propulsive system. In 1954 a proposal was agreed to produce three Ka-22s. The programme was delayed and on 28 March 1956 prototypes 2 and 3 were cancelled. The Ka-22 first lifted from the ground on 17 June 1959, and made its first untethered flight on 15 August 1959. Serious control difficulties were encountered, leading to orders being postponed until the problems were solved, and in July 1960 an order was received to manufacture three more Ka-22s.

==Design==
The Ka-22 was in essence a fixed-wing aircraft with rotors fitted above the wing tips. An engine was mounted on each wing tip, with drive to both a four-bladed tractor propeller and a four-bladed main rotor. The original prototype was powered by 5,900shp Kuznetsov TV-2VK engines, although these were later replaced by the 5,500shp Soloviev D-25VK. The fuselage contained three-seat cockpit above the glazed nose and a main cargo area large enough to contain 80 seats or 16.5 tonnes of cargo. The entire nose could swing open to starboard for loading bulky items. In helicopter mode, the propeller drive was disconnected, and the flaps were lowered to 90 degrees. In fixed-wing mode, the lifting rotors were free to windmill, and the aircraft was controlled by the ailerons and tail surfaces. The twin-wheel landing gear was fixed.

==Operational history==
During its short operational history, a total of eight world records were set by the Ka-22, piloted by D.K. Yefremov and V.V. Gromov. In the 1961 Soviet Aviation Day, this aircraft was on display, making its first public appearance. On 7 October 1961, with spats over the wheels and a fairing behind the cockpit, a class speed record was set at 356.3 km/h. The spats and fairing were then removed and on 24 November 1961 a payload of 16,485 kg was lifted to 2,557 m.

On 28 August 1962, while on an intermediate stop during a ferry flight to Moscow for acceptance testing, Ka-22 01-01 rolled to the left and crashed inverted, killing the entire crew. The cause was found to be the starboard rotor collective pitch control linkage, and further inspection found that two of the other three Ka-22s suffered from similar problems. Subsequently, in order to improve stability and control, a complex differential autopilot was installed. This sensed attitude and angular accelerations, and fed into the control system.

On 12 August 1964, while involved in Soviet Air Force testing, 01-03 was destroyed. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled turn to the right, and in efforts to correct the Ka-22 pitched into a steep dive. The order was given to abandon the aircraft, and three of the crew survived, but Col S.G. Brovtsev, who was flying, and technician A.F. Rogov, were killed.

After this, the Ka-22 was abandoned, with the Mil Mi-6 having already taken on the heavy helicopter role. Eventually the two surviving machines, 01-02 and 01-04, were scrapped. The Ka-22 was only seen once by western observers during the Cold War during an Aviation Day display in Moscow on 9 July 1961.

<text>Tiga Island () is one of a group of small uninhabited volcanic islands in Kimanis Bay off the western coast of Sabah, Malaysia. The islands were formed on 21 September 1897, when an earthquake on Mindanao caused a volcanic eruption near Borneo. The island is in size and has a couple of active mud volcanos at the highest part of the island.
Tiga Island is one of the three islands that make up Tiga Island National Park. The Park Headquarters are on the island, comprising an office complex, and accommodation for the park staff and visiting scientists.

== Transportation ==
Located 48 km south of Kota Kinabalu and the Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park, Tiga Island National Park is reached by driving the 140 km to Kuala Penyu, a small settlement on the tip of the Klias Peninsula.

From here it is another , or about 30 minutes, by boat. Another way of getting there is by chartering a speed boat from Kota Kinabalu and cruise to Tiga Island, or fly to Labuan and charter a speed boat from Labuan.

==In the media==

Tiga Island became well known through the &quot;Survivor&quot; television series. It was the setting of &quot;&quot;, the first American season of the show. It was also the setting of the first seasons of the British shows. The island was also rumoured to be the setting of the third season of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;. However, it was later revealed that Samoa would be used as the location for the series.

<text>Gonchigiin Bumtsend (; 11 September 1881 – 23 September 1953) was a Mongolian revolutionary who held several high level positions within the Mongolian government in the 1940s and early 1950s. He was Chairman of the Presidium of the State Little Khural (titular head of state) of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic from July 1940 until his death, 1953.

==Early life and career==

Bumtsend was born on 11 September 1881 in Züünbürenhanuul Hoshuu, Tüsheet Khan Province (present day Yeröö district, Selenge Province). The son of a poor herding family, Bumtsend taught himself to read and write Mongolian script at age 13 and helped illiterate herdsmen in his area write petitions to the government. In his youth he worked as a woodworker and a cart driver at a horse relay station. During the Bogd Khanaate he worked as a laborer in Khüree (present day Ulaanbaatar).

Bumtsend made his first contact with Mongolian revolutionaries in 1920 while working for the administration of his local hoshuu. He helped collect winter clothing for the partisan army and was involved in propaganda work. He was made a unit commander in the Mongolian partisan army commanded by Damdin Sükhbaatar during the Mongolian Revolution of 1921 and played a role in the defeat of the Chinese garrison at Kyakhta in March 1921. After Mongolian partisans and Soviet Red Army troops successfully entered Khüree in July of that year, Bumtsend&#x27;s unit participated in several mop up guerrilla operations against remnants Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg&#x27;s forces. His unit then suppressed counterrevolutionary uprisings in eastern Mongolia.

He joined the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party in 1923 and spent much of the 1920s working as a police chief while strengthening the administrative structures of the revolution in his home district. Through most of the 1930s he supervised cooperatives in Selenge Province and, as head of the local party cell, was directly involved in efforts to expropriate property of local nobles and the expel Chinese traders from the country.

==Head of state==
Bumtsend was chosen to serve as chairman of the Presidium of the State Small Khural (titular head of state) at the Tenth Party Congress in 1940. It was an honorary role, with power residing in the hands of the prime minister, Khorloogiin Choibalsan. He became a member of the country&#x27;s Politburo in 1943 and chairman of the Great Khural in 1951. He died in office on September 23, 1953, aged 72.

He was twice awarded the Order of Sukhbaatar and received the Soviet Order of Lenin.

<doc id="791107" wikidata="Q907885" url="?curid=791107" title="Gunslinger Girl">
<text>Gunslinger Girl (stylized in small caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yu Aida. It was serialized in &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine from May 2002 to September 2012. Its chapters were collected in 15 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by ASCII Media Works. Set in modern Italy, the series focuses on young cybernetic girls and their adult male handlers who use them as assassins under the directions of a government organization.

The manga series is licensed for an English language release in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. A thirteen-episode anime adaptation produced by Madhouse aired in Japan on Fuji Television from October 2003, to February 2004. A sequel titled &quot;Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-&quot; and created by Artland premiered in Japan on Tokyo MX TV in January 2008. It spanned thirteen episodes, concluding in April 2008. Two additional episodes were released on DVD in Japan in October 2008. Funimation has licensed both anime seasons and the OVAs.

As of December 2012, &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; had over 3.9 million copies in circulation. In 2012, the manga won the Excellence Award in the Manga Division at the 16th Japan Media Arts Festival.

==Plot==
Set in Italy, &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; follows the exploits of the Social Welfare Agency (often referred to as simply &quot;the Agency&quot;), ostensibly a charitable institution sponsored by the Italian government. While the Agency professes to aid the rehabilitation of the physically injured, it is actually a military organization specializing in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism. It is composed of two independent branches: Public Safety, its surveillance and intelligence-gathering division, and Special Ops, the anti-terrorist division.

Special Ops is itself divided into Sections 1 and 2, the latter of which employs young girls who have experienced traumatic and near-death experiences fitted with cybernetic implants as agents. The implants, which consist of synthesized muscles and carbon fiber frames, result in heightened strength and reflexes as well as high resilience to damage and pain.

Each girl is paired with an adult male trainer, or &quot;handler&quot;, and together they are referred to as a &quot;fratello&quot;—Italian for &quot;brother&quot;. The handler is responsible for the training, welfare and field performance of his charge, and is free to use whatever methods he considers suitable. While these methods vary according to the handler, a common part of each girl&#x27;s regimen is brainwashing called &quot;conditioning&quot;, which produces a deadly assassin with unquestioning loyalty to her handler but, if used excessively, also limits her life span.

Each &quot;fratello&quot; exhibits a unique dynamic. Most of the handlers have police or military backgrounds and were recruited directly into Section 2. Most also chose their own cyborgs from a list of candidates, though some appear to have been assigned a cyborg. The Social Welfare Agency primarily concerns itself with dealing with the Padania Republic Faction (PRF or RF), an organization seeking an independent Northern Italy through acts of terrorism and bribery.

==Media==
===Manga===
&quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;, written and illustrated by Yu Aida, premiered in Japan on May 21, 2002 in the monthly &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine, and was completed with the September 27, 2012 issue. The chapters are also being published in collected volumes by ASCII Media Works, with the first volume released on November 27, 2002. The series was collected and published in fifteen volumes in Japan.

When ADV Manga was formed in 2003, the &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; manga series was one of the first titles the new branch of ADV Films licensed for an English language release in North America.

The first volume was released on November 18, 2003, with the next two volumes not released until 2005. At the 2005 AnimeNEXT convention, ADV representative David L. Williams said the slow schedule was due to ADV Manga feeling that they had rushed into the manga market in a period when it was too saturated with new manga titles. After the third volume was released that year, the series went on a two-year hiatus.

Release of the series resumed in July 2007 with the publication of the fourth volume, and six volumes were released as of April 2008. On April 8, 2010, manga publisher Seven Seas Entertainment announced that it had licensed &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; and would be re-released, with a new translation and in omnibus format.

&quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; was adapted into a thirteen-episode anime series based on the first two volumes of the manga. It was directed by Morio Asaka and produced by Madhouse, Bandai Visual, Marvelous Entertainment and Fuji Television, with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. The song &quot;The Light Before We Land&quot; by Scottish indie rock band The Delgados was used as the opening theme. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television from October 8, 2003, to February 19, 2004. The series also aired in Japan on the satellite television network Animax, which later aired the series on its networks worldwide, including its English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia (where the series received its English language television premiere).

&quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; was later aired in the United States on the Independent Film Channel in January 2007. In late 2004, Funimation Entertainment licensed the rights to release the first season of &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; across North America via a three-volume DVD series, releasing the last volume on September 6, 2005.

On September 19, 2006, Funimation released the complete &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; series in a three-DVD box set, with another version released on December 11, 2007. FUNimation&#x27;s release of the first season is also available for download on iTunes, PlayStation Store, and Xbox Live Marketplace. A second season of the series, entitled &quot;Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-&quot;, was officially announced in the October issue of &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;. It premiered on Tokyo MX TV on January 7, 2008, and ran for thirteen additional episodes until its conclusion on March 31, 2008. The second season was criticized for its lackluster animation, but earned praise for its more focused story line. This second season was animated by Artland and featured a new staff, with &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; creator Yu Aida being fully involved as the project&#x27;s chief writer and supervisor. FUNimation has also licensed the second season and is currently streaming subtitled episodes on its website as well as on Veoh, promising a Region 1 retail release in 2009. Two additional episodes (14 and 15) were released on DVD in Japan on October 24, 2008. The sequel is licensed for English language release in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment and in North America by Funimation Entertainment.

The second season made its North American television debut on October 19, 2011 on the Funimation Channel. &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; and &quot;Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino&quot;, the latter including the two additional episodes, were added to the Netflix library in Canada, Singapore, the United States, and Australia as well as some other countries in January 2016.

===Video games===
A set of video games have also been produced for the PlayStation 2, released only in Japan. These take the form of rail shooters in which the player controls one of the girls on her missions. The series is composed of three volumes. There is an additional rogue &quot;fratello&quot; in these games, who go by the names Earnest (handler) and Pia (cyborg). Earnest and Pia do not appear in the manga or anime, nor are they ever mentioned. Pia&#x27;s preferred weapons were the Desert Eagle .50AE and M16A1 with M203 grenade launcher.

On January 9, 2020, it was announced a collaboration between the mobile game Girls&#x27; Frontline and Gunslinger Girl, in which the characters of Angelica, Claes, Rico, Triela and Henrietta would become units available in the game. alongside a new story event merging the world of &quot;Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-&quot; into the world of Girls&#x27; Frontline, a future in which humanity suffered a third world war and environmental collapse, leading to technologically advanced tactical doll or &quot;T-Dolls&quot; are used in combat.

===Other===
On December 21, 2005, an image album for &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; called &quot;Poca Felicità&quot; was released by Marvelous Entertainment. It contains various songs for each of the girls (sung by their respective voice actresses), as well as an instrumental for Pinocchio, extra songs by Josefa, and two other instrumentals. Revo of Sound Horizon wrote all the music and lyrics for the album. The cover art was drawn by Yu Aida.

==Reception==
As of December 2012, the manga had over 3.9 million copies in circulation. In 2012, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs announced the winners of the 16th Japan Media Arts Festival Awards. The &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; manga series won an award for excellence in the Manga Division.

Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy feel the trauma suffered by the girls allows &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot; to show them as &quot;submissive blank slates in the style of Chobits&quot;, feeling that while some handlers treated them like objects, those that tried to befriend them used methods that were like &quot;the seduction of &#x27;damaged goods&#x27; in less popular works such as the &quot;Lolita Anime&quot;.

<doc id="791109" wikidata="Q276200" url="?curid=791109" title="Bayankhongor Province">
<text>The Bayankhongor Province or Bayanhongor Aimag is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia. It is located in the southwest of the country and, at 116,000 square kilometers, it is one of the largest aimags. The capital of the aimag shares the provincial name, Bayankhongor.

==History==
Bayankhongor aimag was formed in 1941 with the establishment of the Bayankhongor Citizen&#x27;s Assembly. There were originally 16 Bayankhongor Area Soums and about 41 thousand people in the aimag. The aimag was originally named &quot;Govi-Bumbugur&quot;, however it was soon changed to Bayankhongor.

In April 1976, Bayankhongor was awarded the Outstanding Red Award for livestock, meat, and wool production. The aimag received substantial investment from the former USSR, including infrastructure and education. However, the USSR also systematically repressed the religion and cultural heritage of the aimag, purging famous monasteries such as the Geegin Monastery and killing thousands of monks.

The &quot;zud&quot;, winter snow disasters, of the early 2000s devastated Bayankhongor&#x27;s livestock and economy. The &quot;zud&quot; also precipitated social changes in the aimag since fewer people now rely on herding as a major source of income and more people have moved to the aimag capital in search of work. Out of the total aimag population estimated at 80,000, somewhere between 25 and 35,000 people live in the provincial capital.

== Geography ==
The Bayankhongor aimag includes very diverse geographic areas. It is typically divided into three areas: the mountainous and wooded Khangai in the north, the central steppe region, and the arid Gobi Desert in the south. 

Bayankhongor contains two mountain ranges, the Khangai Mountains in the north and the Gobi Altai Mountains in the central region. Ikh Bogd, the aimag&#x27;s tallest mountain at 3957 meters, is part of the Gobi Altai range and is located outside of Bogd sum.

The largest lakes in Bayankhongor are Orog Nuur and Böön Tsagaan Nuur, which are found in the central semi-desert region of the aimag (the Valley of Lakes between the Khangai and Gobi Altai ranges), as are several other lakes. Due to the surrounding mountain areas, the lakes in the Valley of Lakes have no outlet and are therefore saline.

Khangai, in the north, contains several hot and cold mineral springs. Shargaljuut, a town about 54 km north of the aimag capital, boasts over 300 springs and has developed a popular resort to take advantage of this natural feature. The mineral waters of the various springs are used by the local people to treat a variety of ailments. Furthermore, there are a handful of genuine oases in the south of the province, most of which are in the Shinejinst area. The most famous oasis, Ekhiin-Gol, was once home to the Lama Dambijant or Ja Lama, an early 20th-century revolutionary turned bandit.

==Wildlife==
Bayankhongor aimag boasts a diverse wildlife population, although, unfortunately, many species are endangered. Despite protected areas in the aimag, the populations of animals such as the snow leopard, long-eared jerboa, Mongolian wild ass, and wild Bactrian camels are rapidly diminishing. The Gobi bear population is estimated at less than 50 animals. On the other hand, Bayankhongor residents have been heard to say that the aimag has the most marmots out of any aimag. The middle salt lake depression plane, particularly areas like &quot;Boon Tsaagan Nuur&quot; and &quot;Orog Nuur&quot; are excellent birding areas with endangered birds such as the Dalmatian pelican and relict gull. Both these lakes are protected through the World Ramsar Convention for Wildlife Diversity. Domesticated animals in Bayakhongor include Bactrian camels, horses, sheep, goats, yaks, cattle, and a yak-cattle hybrid called a &quot;khainag&quot;.

==Attractions==
The attractions of Bayankhongor vary from the natural (Gobi bear) to the man-made (Chess Stones of Erdentsogt); from the old (prehistoric petroglyphs in Bayan Lig) to the older (dinosaur bones in Bugiin Tsav). Since the aimag contains all three major geographic zones of Mongolia (forest, steppe, and desert) it is a great place to commune with nature.

===Museums===
There are two museums in the aimag capital, a History and Ethnographic Museum and a Museum of Natural History. The History and Ethnographic Museum contains exhibits of traditional nomadic life such as information on weddings, &quot;ger&quot; life, and traditional clothes. It also has some interesting artifacts from Bayankhongor during Manchu Rule, and religious exhibits including a pair of famous Green and White Tara statues, the Jadamba Sutras, and shaman robes. The Museum of Natural History contains various mineral specimens from the aimag such as marble and volcanic rock, as well as various mounted endemic animals. The highlights of the museum are the complete skeleton of a Tarbosaurus dinosaur and a 130-million-year-old fossil of a turtle discovered in the Bugiin Tsav (Bugiin Ravine) in the Gobi Desert.

===Parks===
The aimag capital has a few parks, namely the Dinosaur Park and the Children&#x27;s Park. The Dinosaur Park consists of models of the many dinosaur species found in the south of the province. There is also a model &quot;ger&quot; open to visitors. The Children&#x27;s Park, despite the name, is a nature park with scenic pathways and endemic trees and plants. The Tuil Gol (&quot;gol&quot; meaning river in Mongolian) running alongside the town makes for excellent picnic grounds, and Ikh Nomgun Mountain serves as a somewhat challenging day climb.

There are also many protected areas in Bayankhongor (see above).

===Monasteries===
Although the famous monasteries of Bayankhongor were all destroyed during the Soviet purges, since Mongolia&#x27;s independence in 1990, there has been a flurry of rebuilding and reconnecting with the area&#x27;s Buddhist heritage.

There are two monasteries in the aimag capital, Bayankhongor. The entire town surrounds a sacred hill on which it is forbidden to build. Atop the hill sits a giant stupa of some significance, and there is a small monastery with about ten resident monks at the base of the hill. The other, larger, monastery is called Lamyn Gegeenii Gon Gandan Dedlin Khiid, and was built in 1991. The original monastery of this name was located about 30 km outside of the city and was home to over 10,000 monks and lamas making it one of the largest and most prominent monasteries in the county. However, the buildings were demolished and the monks killed or forced to renounce their vows by the Communist government in 1937. The current monastery is home to about 50 monks, and features a giant statue of Sakyamuni Buddha and two Green and White Tara statues modeled after those in the History and Ethnographical Museum of Bayankhongor.

Amarbuyant Khiid, located 50 km west of Shinejist, once housed the 13th Dalai Lama and over 1,000 monks. The 13th Dalai Lama stayed there for ten days in 1904 during a journey from Lhasa to Urga. While visiting, he built a small &quot;ovoo&quot; (rock cairn) which remains among the ruins of the monastery, which was destroyed along with Gegeen Monastery in 1937 during the Communist purges. The gradual restoration process of the complex began in the 1990s after the Communist regime fell.

===Protected areas===
There are two protected areas in Bayankhongor. The Gobi A: Strictly Protected Areas in the south borders China and Ömnögovi aimag. In it live many endangered species such as the Gobi bear and the Zam gecko. The second area is the Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, which is known for its extensive fossil sites, iconic sand dunes, ice canyon, and stunning mountain scenery not to mention the over 200 bird species and 600 varieties of plants. Both of these areas are popular tourist destinations both for foreigners and Mongolians.

=== Petroglyphs and fossils ===

Tsagaan Agui (White Cave) once housed Stone Age people beginning approximately 700,000 years ago. According to researchers, its crystal-lined inner chamber was a holy site for these inhabitants as well as a pilgrimage spot for historical period Buddhists.

The nearby site of &quot;Tsagaan Bulag&quot; (White Stream) was perhaps another sacred site for the region&#x27;s ancient inhabitants. On a white outcrop, the faint drawings of figures are still visible. These figures, although anthropomorphic, bear unusual features such as massive ears and misshaped hands.

&quot;Bayangiin Nuruu&quot; (roughly translated as Rich Mountainside) is another site with well-preserved petroglyphs from approximately 3000BCE. Although not nearly as ancient as other sites, Bayangiin Nuruu&#x27;s drawings are extensive and well-preserved, depicting scenes from daily life.

Dinosaur fossils are also found in the ravines and valleys of southeastern Bayankhongor. Famous sites include &quot;Bugiin Tsav&quot;, &quot;Yasnee Tsav&quot;, and &quot;Khermen Tsav&quot;.

== Transportation ==
The Bayankhongor Airport (BVN/ZMBH) has two runways, and is served by two or three weekly flights to and from Ulaanbaatar that vary from season to season. There are also daily buses to and from Ulaanbaatar (departing from the Dragon Center in Ulaanbaatar at 08.00) which stop in the town of Arvaikheer, as well as less regular buses west towards Gobi-Altai and Khovd aimags. Travel to soums (sub-provincial districts) is possible by mini-vans (microbuses) which gather in the open market in the southern district of the aimag capital.

<doc id="791114" wikidata="Q1931388" url="?curid=791114" title="Cause of death">
<text>In law, medicine, and statistics, cause of death is an official determination of the conditions resulting in a human&#x27;s death, which may be recorded on a death certificate. A cause of death is determined by a medical examiner. In rare cases, an autopsy needs to be performed by a pathologist. The cause of death is a specific disease or injury, in contrast to the manner of death, which is a small number of categories like &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;accident&quot;, &quot;suicide&quot;, and &quot;homicide&quot;, each with different legal implications.
International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes can be used to record manner and cause of death in a systematic way that makes it easy to compile statistics and more feasible to compare events across jurisdictions.

==Accuracy concerns==
A study published in &quot;Preventing Chronic Disease&quot; found that only one-third of New York City resident physicians reported believing that the present system of documentation was accurate. Half reported the inability to record &quot;what they felt to be the correct cause of death&quot;, citing reasons such as technical limitation and instruction to &quot;put something else&quot;. Nearly four-fifths reported being unaware that determinations of &quot;probable&quot;, &quot;presumed&quot;, or &quot;undetermined&quot; could be made, and fewer than three percent reported ever updating a death certificate when conflicting lab results or other new information became available, and cardiovascular disease was indicated as &quot;the most frequent diagnosis inaccurately reported&quot;.

Causes of death are sometimes disputed by relatives or members of the public, particularly when some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity exists in relation to the cause of death. On occasion, such disputes may result from, or sometimes instigate, a conspiracy theory.

Public perception of the relative risk of death by various causes is biased by personal experience and by media coverage. The phrase &quot;hierarchy of death&quot; is sometimes used to describe the factors that cause some deaths to get more attention than others.

Though some opponents of abortion consider it a cause of death, conventionally medical authorities do not confer personhood on fetuses that are not viable outside the womb, and thus abortions are not reported as deaths in these statistics.

==Aging==

Health departments discourage listing &quot;old age&quot; as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research. Aging is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; it is currently considered that there is always a more direct cause (although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases). As an indirect or non-determinative factor, biological aging is the biggest contributor to deaths worldwide. It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been official claims about a possibility of recognizing aging itself as a disease. If this would be so, the situation would change.

==Emotional death==
There are also popular notions that someone can be &quot;scared to death&quot; or die of loneliness or heartbreak. Experiencing fear, extreme stress, or both can cause changes in the body that can, in turn, lead to death. For example, it is possible that overstimulation of the vagus nerve—which decreases heart rate in a mechanism related to the behavior of apparent death (also known as &quot;playing dead&quot; and &quot;playing possum&quot;)—is the cause of documented cases of psychogenic death. The flight or fight response to fear or stress has the opposite effect, increasing heart rate through stress hormones, and can cause cardiovascular problems (especially in those with pre-existing conditions). This is the proposed mechanism for the observed increase in the death rate due to cardiac arrest after widely experienced acutely stressful events such as terrorism, military attacks, and natural disasters (even among those who are not in the affected area) and for documented deaths in muggings and other frightening events which caused no traumatic physical harm. The proximal medical cause of death in these cases is likely to be recorded as cardiac failure or vagal inhibition (which also has other potential causes such as blows to certain parts of the body and nerve injuries).

One specific condition observed to result from acute stress, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is nicknamed &quot;broken heart syndrome&quot;, but the stress need not be relationship-related and need not be negative.

<text>Bulgan () is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia, located in northern Mongolia. Its capital is also named Bulgan.

==History==
Bulgan Province was established in 1937 after being separated from Selenge Province. In 1994, Orkhon Province was taken out from Bulgan Province area to form an independent provice.

== Geography ==
The aimag is surrounded by Russia (Buryatia) in the north, the aimags Khövsgöl in the northwest, Arkhangai in the southwest, Övörkhangai in the south, Töv in the southeast, and Selenge in the northeast. The small Orkhon Aimag forms an enclave at the border to Selenge.

The north of the aimag is characterized by alpine forests, gradually blending in the arid steppe plains of the central Mongolian highland. The main rivers are the Orkhon and the Selenge, first of which enter the aimag from Övörkhangai while the second is enters from Khövsgöl Province. As a result, southern and central Bulgan is one of Mongolia&#x27;s few arable regions.

== Administrative subdivisions ==
* - The aimag capital Bulgan city.

** - data includes Khyalganat urban-type settlement (3,300 pop.), 25 km North from the Khangal sum centre

*** - data includes Saikhan-Ovoo urban-type settlement (500 pop.), 25 km North-West from the Saikhan sum centre

==Demographics==
The province has a population of over 60,000 people. Around 74.5% of them live in rural areas.

==Economy==
Livestock is one of the main economic activity of the province. In 2018, the province contributed to 0.96% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

== Transportation ==
The Bulgan Airport (UGA/ZMBN) has one unpaved runway and is served by regular flights to Ulaanbaatar, Khovd, and Mörön.

<text>Alonzo Barton Cornell (January 22, 1832 – October 15, 1904) was a New York politician and businessman who was the 27th governor of New York from 1880 to 1882.

==Early years==
Cornell was born in Ithaca, New York, on January 22, 1832. He was the eldest son of Ezra Cornell (1807–1874), the founder of Cornell University, and Mary Ann (&quot;née&quot; Wood) Cornell (1811–1891). Among his siblings was his brother Franklin C. Cornell. He attended the common schools of Ithaca and graduated from Ithaca Academy.

==Career==
At the age of fifteen, he began a career in the field of telegraphy, later working as a manager in a telegraph office in Cleveland, Ohio. Afterwards, he owned steamboats on Cayuga Lake from 1862 to 1863. From 1864 to 1869, he was a cashier and vice president of the First National Bank of Ithaca. He was a director of the Western Union Telegraph Company, which had been co-founded by his father, from 1868 to 1876, and was its vice president from 1870 to 1876.

He was town supervisor of Ithaca in 1864–5. From 1858 until 1866, he was chairman of the Tompkins County Republican committee, and in 1866-7 was a member of the Republican state committee. He was one of the first commissioners for the erection of the new state capitol at Albany from 1868 until 1871. He was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1868, but was defeated by the Democrat, Allen C. Beach. He was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as Surveyor of the Port of New York.
From 1870 to 1878, he was chairman of the state Republican Party. He resigned his position as Surveyor of the Port of New York to become a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 11th D.) in 1873, and was elected Speaker, one of the very few times a first-term member was chosen. He was influential at the 1876 Republican National Convention which nominated Rutherford B. Hayes. In January 1877, he was appointed naval officer of the Port of New York by Grant.

Hayes, upon becoming president, directed the Treasury Department to notify Cornell that he must resign from the state and national Republican committees as a condition of remaining naval officer. Regarding this as an invasion of his civil and political rights, Cornell declined to obey the mandate, whereupon a successor was nominated, but was rejected by the Senate. After the adjournment of the Senate in July 1878, Hayes suspended both the collector (Chester A. Arthur) and the naval officer, and their successors were finally confirmed. At the subsequent elections, Cornell was chosen Governor of New York and Arthur became Vice President of the United States.

Cornell was governor from 1880 to 1882, elected in 1879. His administration was noted for economy in public expenditures, and his vetoes of appropriation bills were beyond all precedent. Upon his recommendation, a state board of health and the state railroad commission were created, women were made eligible for school officers, a reformatory for women established, and the usury laws were modified.

The resignation of the New York senators from the U. S. Senate in 1881 provoked a bitter contest for the succession, by which the Republican Party was divided into hostile factions, the Stalwarts and the Half Breeds. Cornell&#x27;s opponents prevented his re-nomination for governor.

===Later life===
During his latter years, Cornell lived in New York City, where he had a mansion built in the 1870s at 616 Fifth Avenue on the west side of the avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, and wrote a biography of his father in 1884.

==Personal life==
On November 9, 1852, Cornell married Ellen Augusta Covert (1834–1893). She was the daughter of George P. Covert, a lifelong friend of his father, and Esther Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Bassett) Covert. Together, they were the parents of:

* Charles Ezra Cornell (1855–1947), a lawyer who married Katharine Lawyer Bouck, a granddaughter of New York Governor William C. Bouck.
* Edwin Morgan Cornell (1862–1870), who died young.
* Henry Watson Cornell (1866–1932), a lawyer who married Margaret Feek Bouck (b. 1870), also a granddaughter of New York Governor William C. Bouck.
* Marguerite Cornell, who married Arnoud Jacob Joris Van der Does de Bye, a professor who was the son of a Dutch count, in 1909.
* Roscoe Conkling Cornell, the circulation manager of the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; who married Nelle Edith Beyerle.

After the death of his first wife in 1893, he remarried on June 8, 1894, to her younger sister, Esther Elizabeth Covert (1839–1923), a native of Auburn, New York.

After suffering a stroke of apoplexy followed by Bright&#x27;s disease in August 1904, Cornell died on October 15, 1904, in Ithaca, aged 72. He was interred with his father and mother in Sage Chapel on the Cornell University campus.

===Legacy===
Cornell&#x27;s papers are held in Cornell University Library&#x27;s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.

<text>John Marty Stuart (born September 30, 1958) is an American country and bluegrass music singer, songwriter, and musician. Active since 1968, Stuart initially toured with Lester Flatt, and then in Johnny Cash&#x27;s road band before beginning work as a solo artist in the early 1980s. He is known for his combination of rockabilly, country rock, and bluegrass music influences, his frequent collaborations and cover songs, and his distinctive stage dress.

His greatest commercial success came in the first half of the 1990s on MCA Records Nashville. Stuart has recorded over 20 studio albums, and has charted over 30 times on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. His highest chart entry is &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27;&quot;, a duet with Travis Tritt. 

Stuart has won five Grammy Awards out of 16 nominations. He is also a member of the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

John Marty Stuart was born in Philadelphia, Mississippi, on September 30, 1958. 

Stuart learned to play guitar and mandolin as a child, and by age 12, he had joined a gospel band called The Sullivans. While a member of this band, Stuart met mandolinist Roland White, a member of Lester Flatt&#x27;s backing band; White invited Stuart to perform with Flatt at a concert in Delaware in 1972, which led to him becoming a regular member of that band. He continued to tour in this capacity until Flatt retired in 1978, and recorded an independent album called &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; that same year. After this, Stuart performed with Vassar Clements and Doc Watson before joining Johnny Cash&#x27;s band in 1980. 

In 1982, he released a second album called &quot;Busy Bee Cafe&quot; on Sugar Hill Records. The album was composed of a jam session that included a number of country and bluegrass performers such as Cash, Watson, and Earl Scruggs. In 1985, Stuart accompanied Johnny Cash to Memphis and played on the &quot;Class of &#x27;55&quot; album that also featured Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis. At the end of the session, Perkins presented Stuart with his guitar. Later that year, Stuart left Cash&#x27;s band and landed a recording contract with Columbia Records.

==Recording career==
Stuart released his self-titled debut album on Columbia in 1985. The album accounted for Stuart&#x27;s first chart entry on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts with his first single release, &quot;Arlene&quot;. Three other singles charted from the album in 1986: &quot;Honky Tonker&quot; and &quot;All Because of You&quot;, both written by Steve Forbert, and Stuart&#x27;s own &quot;Do You Really Want My Lovin&#x27;&quot;. However, these songs were less successful on the charts. The success of &quot;Arlene&quot; helped Marty to receive a nomination by the Academy of Country Music Awards for Top New Male Vocalist, losing to Randy Travis. AllMusic writer Jim Worbois gave the album a mixed review, stating that it was &quot;Not a great album, but made somewhat more interesting by some of the people appearing on the record and the inclusion of two Steve Forbert songs.&quot; He recorded a second album for Columbia titled &quot;Let There Be Country&quot;, which charted two singles in 1988: the Merle Haggard composition &quot;Mirrors Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; and &quot;Matches&quot;. Due to the underperformance of the singles, Columbia chose not to release the album, and Stuart exited the label to return to Mississippi.

===1989-91: Beginning of MCA Records tenure===
After briefly rejoining the Sullivans, he returned to Nashville and signed with MCA Records in 1989. That label issued the album &quot;Hillbilly Rock&quot; that year. Co-produced by Tony Brown and session guitarist Richard Bennett, the album charted four singles on Hot Country Songs. First was a cover of Cash&#x27;s &quot;Cry! Cry! Cry!&quot;, followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Her Lonely Too Long&quot;, which Stuart wrote with Kostas. While these were unsuccessful on the charts, the album&#x27;s title track (written by Paul Kennerley) became Stuart&#x27;s first top-ten country hit in 1990. The album&#x27;s final release was &quot;Western Girls&quot;, which Stuart also co-wrote. &quot;Hillbilly Rock&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1997 for shipments of 500,000 copies.

His second MCA album, &quot;Tempted&quot;, followed in 1991. The album charted four singles on Hot Country Songs between 1991 and 1992: &quot;Little Things&quot;, &quot;Till I Found You&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, and &quot;Burn Me Down&quot;, of which all except &quot;Till I Found You&quot; reached the top ten. Bennett and Brown stayed on as producers, with the former also contributing alongside Stuart on both guitar and mandolin. Kennerley and Kostas contributed as both songwriters and backing vocalists; also performing backing vocals on some tracks were Billy Thomas and Ray Herndon, who were also recording on MCA in McBride &amp; the Ride at the time. Jana Pendragon of AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing it to Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot; in style and saying, &quot;Stuart kicks country-pop in its well-defined hindquarters[…]But Stuart is just as deadly when he slows things down and does a ballad.&quot;

Also in 1991, Stuart co-wrote a song with Travis Tritt called &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27;&quot;. Recorded on the latter&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;It&#x27;s All About to Change&quot;, this song was released in between &quot;Tempted&quot; and &quot;Burn Me Down&quot;. It would go on to become Stuart&#x27;s highest chart entry, reaching number two on Hot Country Songs in early 1992. It also won Stuart his first Grammy Award, for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals that year. This song&#x27;s success also led to the two touring in 1992 as the No Hats Tour, a reference to the fact that unlike most contemporary country musicians, neither Tritt nor Stuart sported a cowboy hat.

===1992-95: End of MCA tenure===

His next MCA album, &quot;This One&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You&quot;, came out in 1992. The lead single &quot;This One&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)&quot;, also a duet with Tritt, was a top-ten hit in 1992, but the followup singles &quot;Now That&#x27;s Country&quot;, &quot;High on a Mountain Top&quot;, and &quot;Hey Baby&quot; were less successful. Kennerley and Cash were once again among the contributing vocalists, while Ashley Cleveland and Pam Tillis both sang backing vocals on &quot;High on a Mountain Top&quot;. Johnny Cash provided duet vocals on &quot;Doin&#x27; My Time&quot;, while the track &quot;Me and Hank and Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; sampled voice recordings of Lester Flatt, Hank Williams, and Ernest Tubb. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the album &quot;A&quot;, finding the &quot;stylistic mix&quot; superior to preceding albums, noting influences of bluegrass, Southern rock, rockabilly, and blues in his delivery and song choices. Also in 1992, Columbia issued &quot;Let There Be Country&quot;. &quot;This One&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in 1993. Stuart won his second Grammy Award in 1993, in the category of Best Country Instrumental Performance, as one of several featured artists on Asleep at the Wheel&#x27;s cover of &quot;Red Wing&quot; on their 1993 album &quot;Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot;.

&quot;Love and Luck&quot; was his next album, released in 1994. Only one single, &quot;Kiss Me, I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, made top 40 from the project. Stuart co-produced the album with Brown, while also contributing on guitar, mandolin, and songwriting. The album&#x27;s opening title track featured Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, and Harry Stinson on backing vocals. Also included were two covers: Billy Joe Shaver&#x27;s &quot;If I Give My Soul&quot; and The Flying Burrito Brothers&#x27; &quot;Wheels&quot;, as well as the mandolin instrumental &quot;Marty Stuart Visits the Moon&quot;. Daniel Gioffre of AllMusic highlighted these three tracks in particular as being among the strongest on the album. Nash rated the album &quot;B&quot;, stating that &quot;As a singer, Marty Stuart has all the zip of unbuttered toast, and as a writer, too many of his songs float aimlessly...Yet Stuart has genuine love for the early country greats and injects his own work with such impassioned strains of old hillbilly styles, that he charms in spite of his limitations.&quot;

Following this album, MCA issued a compilation called &quot;The Marty Party Hit Pack&quot; in 1995, which contained singles from his previous MCA albums, as well as &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27;&quot;, the previously-unreleased &quot;The Likes of Me&quot; and &quot;If I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot;, and two cover songs previously found on multi-artist tribute albums released in 1994. These were a rendition of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, featuring The Jordanaires and previously found on &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never: The Tribute to Elvis&quot;, and The Band&#x27;s &quot;The Weight&quot;, featuring The Staple Singers and previously found on &quot;Rhythm, Country and Blues&quot;. Both of these cover songs were produced by Don Was, while Don Cook handled production on the two new songs. &quot;The Likes of Me&quot; was previously cut by Conway Twitty on his 1993 album &quot;Final Touches&quot;, on which Cook was also a producer. Both of these new songs issued as singles in 1995, but neither entered the country music top 40. Jay Orr of &quot;New Country&quot; magazine criticized &quot;The Likes of Me&quot; and the two cover songs, but otherwise found the album a &quot;neat summation&quot; of Stuart&#x27;s music. &quot;The Marty Party Hit Pack&quot; became Stuart&#x27;s fourth and final gold album in 1998.

Stuart released &quot;Honky Tonkin&#x27;s What I Do Best&quot; in 1996, which produced two more minor chart entries in the title track (another duet with Tritt) and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Love&quot; that year. The title track also won Stuart a Vocal Event of the Year award from the Country Music Association. Nash rated the album &quot;A−&quot;, finding an influence of The Beatles in &quot;Thanks to You&quot; and of Delta blues in &quot;The Mississippi Mudcat and Sister Sheryl Crow&quot;.

==Career since the late 1990s==
Stuart released another album in 1999 called &quot;The Pilgrim&quot;. It charted only one single that year with &quot;Red, Red Wine and Cheatin&#x27; Songs&quot;. A concept album based around a love triangle, the album featured vocal contributions from Pam Tillis, George Jones, and Emmylou Harris, as well as a poem recited by Johnny Cash. An uncredited review of the album in AllMusic was largely favorable, stating that &quot;no one&#x27;s idea of a commercial country album, one has to admire the sheer ambition of the project, as well as the guts it took MCA Records to release what amounts to a unique and deeply personal artistic vision.&quot; After this album proved to be commercially unsuccessful, Stuart left MCA in 2000.

His next album was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Country Music&quot;, released on Columbia Records. For this album, Stuart assembled a new backing band called Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives, consisting of Harry Stinson on drums, Kenny Vaughan on guitar, and Brian Glenn on bass guitar. Included on the albums were covers of Porter Wagoner&#x27;s &quot;A Satisfied Mind&quot;, Carl Butler and Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Sundown in Nashville&quot;, and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Walls of a Prison&quot;, as well as the Merle Haggard duet &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Two singles from the album both charted: &quot;If There Ain&#x27;t, There Ought&#x27;a Be&quot; and &quot;Too Much Month (At the End of the Money)&quot;. Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;is relentless in both its attack and in the pleasure it provides to the listener. There are hot licks everywhere, with great songs, vocals, and a tapestry of moods, textures, and shades that serve to leave one impression: Stuart&#x27;s radical experimentation of the last ten years has resulted in his finest moment thus far.&quot;

In 2005, Stuart launched a custom record label, Superlatone Records, to issue overlooked Southern Gospel and Roots music recordings. Stuart released three critically acclaimed collections on Superlatone, &quot;Souls&#x27; Chapel&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, and &quot;Live at the Ryman&quot;. In October 2005, Stuart released a concept album, &quot;Badlands: Ballads of the Lakota&quot;, which pays tribute to the Sioux culture in what is now South Dakota. In 2007, Stuart produced Porter Wagoner&#x27;s final album on the predominantly punk label Epitaph Records.

In August 2022, he signed with Snakefarm Records, his first record deal in nearly ten years. He also went on tour with the Fabulous Superlatives in Europe, with scheduled performances in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. Sam Williams, Hank Williams grandson, was his supporting act.

==The Fabulous Superlatives==

The Fabulous Superlatives, Marty Stuart&#x27;s band since 2002, includes him on guitar and mandolin, Kenny Vaughan on guitar, and Harry Stinson on drums, and from 2002 until 2008, Brian Glenn on bass. From 2008 until 2015, Paul Martin was on bass. In 2015, Chris Scruggs replaced Paul Martin on bass, and also played steel guitar. Every member also sings.

==Musical style==
In a 1992 article for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Kate Meyers wrote that Stuart &quot;considers himself more a stylist than a singer, meaning he gets by with a mix of approaches...rather than relying on a fantastic voice of his own&quot;, citing Johnny Cash, Bill Monroe, and Muddy Waters as his main musical influences. Stuart&#x27;s musical image in the 1990s was also defined by his distinct clothing and hairstyle. Meyers described him as having a &quot;striking black mane, speckled with well-earned gray...[o]ften tied in a black or pink bandana headband&quot;, faded jeans from Levi Strauss &amp; Co., a black T-shirt, cowboy boots, a concho belt, and a rhinestone-studded suit jacket designed by Nudie Cohn (sometimes termed the &quot;Nudie suit&quot;).

==Equipment and memorabilia==
Stuart is known for his extensive collection of country music memorabilia. Some of his collection was exhibited at the Tennessee State Museum in 2007 as &quot;Sparkle &amp; Twang: Marty Stuart&#x27;s American Musical Odyssey.&quot; The exhibit later appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, and at the Arkansas Statehouse Museum. In early 2018, Stuart co-curated, along with the Grammy Museum, an exhibit at the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, entitled &quot;Marty Stuart&#x27;s Way Out West: A Country Music Odyssey&quot;. The exhibit highlighted the West Coast impact on country music, featuring items by artists including Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, and Stuart himself. Many of the items in the exhibit came from the private collection of Stuart, including the last portrait of Cash (taken by Stuart four days before Cash died).

Yvonne and Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers gave one of their father &quot;Pops&quot; Staples&#x27; guitars to Marty Stuart after Pop&#x27;s death. Mavis Staples explained, &quot;My father was Marty&#x27;s godfather. My sisters and I took him in as our brother. He&#x27;s the only one that I&#x27;ve heard who -- when he&#x27;s playing guitar, he sounds like Pop. He can play just like him.&quot;

Stuart&#x27;s guitars also include &#x27;Clarence&#x27;, the familiar two-tone Fender Telecaster, once owned by Clarence White. This instrument is the original B-Bender guitar, built and designed by White and Gene Parsons around 1967, to allow the guitarist to manually raise the guitar&#x27;s &#x27;B&#x27; string one whole step to play in a style similar to a pedal steel guitar. Stuart bought this unique guitar in 1980 from White&#x27;s widow, and continued to play it in concert, as of 2019.

==&quot;The Marty Stuart Show&quot;==
Stuart is host of &quot;The Marty Stuart Show&quot;, which features traditional country music in the vein of &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot;, &quot;Flatt &amp; Scruggs&quot;, the &quot;Wilburn Brothers Show&quot;, and &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. &quot;The Marty Stuart Show&quot; began airing at 8:00 pm on November 1, 2008, on cable&#x27;s RFD-TV. Although no new episodes have been produced as of 2022, the network continues to air old episodes of the show under the name &quot;The Best of the Marty Stuart Show&quot;.

Each episode features music by Stuart and his band the Fabulous Superlatives. Stuart hosts and produces the 30-minute episodes, with WSM disc jockey and Grand Ole Opry announcer Eddie Stubbs serving as the show&#x27;s emcee.

==Country Music Foundation==
Stuart is a member of the board of the Country Music Foundation and is a past president. Stuart has also been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1992. On August 12, 2020, Stuart was selected to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Stuart&#x27;s first wife was Johnny Cash&#x27;s daughter Cindy, to whom he was married from 1983 to 1988. 

Since July 8, 1997, Stuart has been married to country artist Connie Smith, whom he had admired since his childhood. Stuart described encountering Smith many years earlier, after attending her concert: &quot;I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown of Philadelphia, Mississippi, to work at a fair. She hasn&#x27;t changed a bit. She looked great then and she looks great now.&quot; Stuart said he told his mother then that he was going to marry Connie Smith. Smith explains how they have sustained their marriage : &quot;Make the Lord the center ... and commit.&quot;

<doc id="791189" wikidata="Q7315291" url="?curid=791189" title="Reserved powers">
<text>Reserved powers, residual powers, or residuary powers are the powers that are neither prohibited to be exercised by an organ of government, nor given by law to any other organ of government. Such powers, as well as a general power of competence, nevertheless may exist because it is impractical to detail in legislation every act allowed to be carried out by the state.

== By country ==
=== Common law countries ===
The United Kingdom and countries whose legal system is based on common law, such as Canada, India, Israel, and Ireland, have similar legal frameworks of reserved powers.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, despite the centralized nature of the constitution, the High Court adopted the &quot;reserved powers doctrine&quot; which was used until 1920 to preserve as much autonomy for the states as can be interpreted from the constitution. This practice changed with the Engineers&#x27; Case which led reserved powers to be given to the Commonwealth.

==== Canada ====
In Canada the reserved powers lie with the federal government.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution states that the powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states, unless prohibited to the states. This amendment does not refer to powers “explicitly” or “expressly” granted to the federal government, and therefore the federal government possesses many implied powers that are not reserved to the states.

After World War II, the Supreme Court often ruled against parties challenging the powers of Congress per the Tenth Amendment, with exceptions during the Rehnquist Court. The Supreme Court continues to occasionally decide cases striking down federal laws that exceed both the explicit and implied powers of Congress, as in &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot; (2018).

In the United States, many powers that are not reserved to the states are exclusive federal powers, and thus states are forbidden to exercise them. Alternatively, powers that are not reserved to the states may be concurrent powers that both the states and federal government can exercise at the same time (such as the power to enact taxes to raise revenue).

<text>The Homecoming Saga is a science fiction series by Orson Scott Card. The series is patterned on the Book of Mormon. Some of the names also come from the Book of Mormon.

The series, containing five volumes, takes place forty million years in the future, with volumes 1-3 taking place on a fictional planet called Harmony. The main premise of the series is that a human diaspora occurred after Earth was rendered uninhabitable by human wars. Forty plus planets, including Harmony, are colonized by humans (though only two are actually named in the series: Ramadan, settled by Arabs; and Harmony, apparently settled by Slavic cultures, as its languages all developed from Russian.)

On Harmony, the advancement of human technology is controlled by the Oversoul – an artificial intelligence monitor, using a small army of satellites, established by the original colonists to monitor the planet. It also influences the actions of humans. Though it does not prevent them from doing evil, it keeps their societal capability for destruction limited by suppressing any thoughts that might lead to things like long-distance travel or instant communication. Thus the technology on Harmony includes basic computers and solar-powered handheld energy weapons, but no cars or even wagons. The Oversoul, however, was only designed to last twenty million years, so eventually it begins to break down. It decides to send an expedition back to Earth to seek advice from the entity of which it is an imitation: the mysterious Keeper of Earth. Soon after, the people begin to receive dreams similar to those that the Oversoul sends that come directly from the Keeper of Earth via faster-than-light transmission.

As loosely inspired by the themes of the Book of Mormon, the first three books in the series deal with the main characters travails in journeying the site of the ships via a slow trek across Harmony. The fourth book, &quot;Earthfall&quot;, concerns itself with the journey of one of the ships back to Earth and the culture clash that results upon its homecoming, specifically, establishing a settlement and reconciling human culture with the existing creatures that have risen on Earth in the intervening millennia. The final volume, &quot;Earthborn&quot;, takes place five centuries further in the future; the one remaining member of the original expedition seeks to alter the path of the changing culture and see the Oversoul&#x27;s mission finally fulfilled.

==Books in the series==
* &quot;The Memory of Earth&quot; (1992)
* &quot;The Call of Earth&quot; (1992)
* &quot;The Ships of Earth&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Earthfall&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Earthborn&quot; (1995)

==Characters==
The characters listed here are those who go on the expedition to Earth; they play major roles throughout the series. For characters whose significance is primarily in one book, see that book&#x27;s page.

; The Oversoul: Artificial intelligence that records all events on Harmony, worshipped as a goddess by the women and a god by the men. It is able to influence the actions of the people, who were genetically altered to be able to receive its directions. When the Oversoul realized that it was in danger of decaying completely without having completed its purpose, it began influencing certain humans to breed so that their descendants would have greater and greater ability to hear the Oversoul. In &quot;The Memory of Earth&quot; it begins directly instructing these people to engineer a return to Earth, in the hope of receiving instructions from the Keeper of Earth, on which the Oversoul was modeled. The Oversoul is a parallel to God in the Book of Mormon

; Nafai: Fourteen at the start of the series, he is chosen by the Oversoul to lead the expedition to Earth, in part because of his extraordinary connection to it. He is clever and well-intentioned, but is young, and has difficulty knowing when to stop talking. As the series progresses, Nafai matures and grows into his role. He is the second son of both Volemak and Rasa. He marries Luet, and their first child is Chveya. He inherits the cloak of the starmaster, which enhances his connection to the Oversoul and performs such useful functions as healing injuries. His name is a reference to Nephi, the author and namesake of the first books of the Book of Mormon.

; Luet: Thirteen at the start of the series, she is known in Basilica as the Waterseer because her connection to the Oversoul enables her to have and interpret prophetic dreams. She is consistently more mature than Nafai, tempering his impulsive and occasionally headstrong personality with patience and good counsel. Nevertheless, she needs him as much as he needs her.

; Issib: Nafai&#x27;s older brother, crippled by trauma in the womb. In Basilica and in the vicinity of the ships he can move with the aid of &quot;floats&quot;, which move his limbs in response to simple muscle contractions, but outside of these areas he is confined to a high-tech chair. It is his studies that lead him to realize that the Oversoul is blocking things from the thoughts of humans on Harmony; after he and Nafai begin defying the Oversoul, it begins to work with them. He marries Hushidh, and becomes one of the best at dealing with the Index. Issib is patterned on Sam from the Book of Mormon.

; Hushidh: Luet&#x27;s older sister, she is a raveler: able to see the relationships between people manifested as threads in her vision. This gives her remarkable insight into what people are thinking, as well as the ability to know what well-chosen words will break weak threads. Unfortunately, she is not so adept at seeing the larger effects of her (un)raveling. Though she at first sees her marriage to Issib as a convenient pairing of the unmarried males and females on the trip, they fall in love.

; Elemak: Nafai&#x27;s oldest brother. An accomplished tradesman with an aptitude for learning languages, he is nevertheless too power-hungry and violent to be chosen by the Oversoul. He never forgives Nafai for this. Although he has no wish to kill the rest of the company, he never lets go of the idea of killing Nafai. As his plots grow more complex, so do Nafai&#x27;s defenses, thanks to the Oversoul and the community around him. Elemak is patterned on Laman from the Book of Mormon.

; Mebbekew: Nafai&#x27;s second oldest brother. An unabashed hedonist and would-be actor, his most recent seduction at the start of the expedition is Rasa&#x27;s niece Dol, a former child actor. They get married, but Mebbekew is eventually unfaithful. He also sides with his older brother Elemak against Nafai, though he is considerably less clever than either. Mebbekew is patterned on Lemuel from the Book of Mormon.

; Rasa: Nafai&#x27;s mother. In Basilica she runs a school with enormous prestige, and five of her &quot;nieces&quot; (prize students adopted into roles of permanent sponsorship) embark on the expedition to Earth. After failing to renew her marriage with Volemak, she is married to Gaballufix for a while, but eventually goes back to Volemak and renews him consistently until the expedition. Though the oldest woman in the company, she bears three more children in the course of the journey, the oldest being Oykib. Rasa is patterned on Sariah from the Book of Mormon.

; Volemak: Nafai&#x27;s father. On Harmony his title is the Wetchik, and he is a wealthy trader. His faith in the Oversoul and its plans is unshakeable. Though it leads him to seemingly irrational actions early on, they are justified by the time the group sets out on his journey. Eventually it is only Volemak&#x27;s authority that keeps Nafai&#x27;s supporters and Elemak&#x27;s supporters from outright conflict. Volemak is patterned on Lehi from the Book of Mormon.

; Shedemei: A brilliant geneticist, and one of Rasa&#x27;s nieces, she joins the expedition not because of any strong connections to the party but because she has the equipment and the expertise to manage the flora and fauna on the possibly ravaged Earth. She and Zdorab are the last unpaired couple, and she resents the idea of marrying him until she gets to know him, at which point they become among the closest pairs in the company. She was the Oversoul&#x27;s second choice to don the cloak of the starmaster if Nafai refused it. After they build a community on Earth, Nafai eventually does give her the cloak, at which point she returns to the orbiting spaceship to watch over the planet like a garden. She spends much of her time in suspended animation, with the Oversoul her only company on waking. Five hundred years later, known on the planet as The One Who Was Never Buried, she returns to start a school and avert a political tragedy.

; Zdorab: A servant, picked up apparently by accident on retrieving the Index. The only gay character in the novels, he is a wallflower, keeping quietly out of the way and handling menial tasks so fluidly that the others begin to take it for granted that they are his job. On the other hand, he is the most adept at navigating the Index, using back doors to avoid loops and blocks in the Oversoul&#x27;s programming. Shedemei is disdainful of him until she confronts him about their inevitable marriage and learns that his uncomplaining servitude is a survival mechanism for being homosexual on a fairly bigoted planet. Shedemei revises her opinion of Zdorab, and the two become very close. When Shedemei retreats to the ship, Zdorab goes with her; without the cloak of the starmaster, he dies before she does, but (thanks to suspended animation) long after the rest of the company. Zdorab is patterned on Zoram from the Book of Mormon.

; Eiadh: One of Rasa&#x27;s beautiful nieces. Nafai is in love with her at age fourteen, but she is attracted to power and marries Elemak. As the two struggle for dominance, she wavers between the two. By this time Nafai is married to, and in love with, Luet; he never considers adultery. To her credit, Eiadh eventually sides with Nafai against her murderous husband, and has matured enough that she does not make advances on him.

; Sevet: Rasa&#x27;s older daughter by Gaballufix. A fine singer in Basilica, she cheats on her husband regularly - first with Obring, later with Elemak and Mebbekew. Her husband, Vas, is deceptively accepting; unlike Elemak, his plotting is not obvious, but he is cold and calculating and never forgets a grudge.

; Kokor: Rasa&#x27;s younger daughter by Gaballufix. Violently jealous of her sister Sevet. When she discovers Sevet in bed with her husband, the mean-spirited but weak-willed Obring, she lashes out, striking Sevet in the throat and destroying her singing ability. The two are always attempting to dramatically one-up each other, and are never truly reconciled.

==Items==
; Pulse: A rifle-like light based weapon. The range is about 1/4 the range of a good Gorayni bow. A pulse has multiple settings for beam strength and area. The different settings vary from one used for cooking meat to one able to blast a man to pieces at point blank range. Despite its lethality, the pulse is designed nearly exclusively for hunting animals. At several points, characters express their shock at the prospect of using it as a deadly weapon. It is battery powered and the battery can be recharged by exposure to sunlight. Since its battery decays with use, unused pulses should be hidden away in a dark place. Once a battery is dead the weapon becomes useless and is discarded. Pulses can be manufactured but the knowledge to repair them is beyond humans.

<text>Khentii () is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia, located in the east of the country. Its capital is Chinggis City. The aimag is named after the Khentii Mountains. It is best known as the birthplace, and likely final resting place, of Temüjin, otherwise known as Genghis Khan.

== Geography ==
The aimag borders with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai) in the north. The neighbouring aimags are Selenge in the northwest, Töv in the west, Govisümber in the southwest, Dornogovi in the south, Sükhbaatar in the southeast, and Dornod in the east. The border to Töv is divided by the city of Baganuur, an administrative exclave of Ulaanbaatar.

The northwest of the aimag is covered by the eastern part of the Khentii Mountains; towards the southeast, the landscape changes into the eastern Mongolian steppe plains. The mountain Burkhan Khaldun in the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area is considered sacred and assumed to be the birthplace of Genghis Khan.

The Kherlen River originates South of the Burkhan Khaldun; the river then crosses the south of the aimag in the eastern direction after a detour through Töv. A little further east is the spring of the Onon River. The Onon-Balj National Park is located in the northeast of the aimag.

== Population ==
== Administrative subdivisions ==

:* - including Berkh.
:** - including Bor-Öndör.
:*** - including the aimag capital Chinggis.

==Economy==
In 2018, the province contributed to 1.26% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

<doc id="791215" wikidata="Q194098" url="?curid=791215" title="Khovd Province">
<text>Khovd (; ), alternatively romanized as Khobhd, is one of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia, located in the west of the country. Its capital is also named Khovd. Khovd province is approximately 1,580 km from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&#x27;s capital. It takes its name from the Khovd River, which is located in this province.

Islam is a significant religion practiced by around 10–15% of the population, namely the Kazakhs and a small minority of Uyghurs.

== Population ==
Khovd is distinguished by its multi-cultural population. It is home to more than 17 nationalities and ethnicities. Each of these groups has its own distinct traditional dwelling and settlement pattern, dress and other cultural distinctions, literary, artistic, and musical traditions.

The Khovd aimag population growth stopped in 1991, then migration out of the aimag (approx. 20,000 in 1992-2004) compensated the natural increase and confined aimag’s population within the limits of 87 thousand to 92 thousand since.

==Climate==
Khovd is notorious for its harsh weather, for temperatures regularly reach as high as during summer and as low as during winter. The climate is dry, as it receives approximately the same average annual precipitation as Phoenix, Arizona.

===Rivers===
The major rivers are:
*Khovd River 
*Bulgan River 
*Buyant River
*Hoid tsenher River 
*Dund tsenher River 
*Uench River 
*Bodonch River

===Lakes===
*Khar-Us Nuur 
*Khar Nuur
*Dörgön Nuur
*Tsetseg lake

===Mountains===
*Altai Mountains
**Jargalant hairhan
**Bumbat hairhan
**Baatar hairhan
**Monkh hairhan
**Baitag bogd

==Transportation==
The Khovd Airport (HVD/ZMKD) has two runways, one of which is paved, and gets served by regular flights from and to Ulaanbaatar, Mörön, and Bulgan. And flights are planned to Ürümqi city of Xinjiang.

== Economy ==
The region around the Khovd city is famous in Mongolia for its watermelon crop. There is a sizable hydroelectric dam-building project underway that will theoretically generate enough electricity to power the three most western aimags (Uvs, Bayan-Ölgii, and Khovd). The city of Khovd is connected to the Russian power grid and subject to blackouts if it falls behind in its payments. Domestic and international tourism and sports hunting are a sizable industry of Khovd province. The natural environment, fresh and salt water lakes, mountains, valleys, caves, ancient rock paintings and fortresses are other sightseeing attractions.

Animal herding is the main economy of this province.


In 2018, the province contributed to 1.21% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

== Administrative subdivisions ==

The aimag capital Khovd is geographically located in the Buyant sum, but is administered as independent Jargalant sum. The administrative center of the Khovd Sum is also called Khovd, which is a common source of confusion. The other administrative centers carry the name of the respective Sum as well.

He reached No. 5 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart with &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and reached the Top 10 in Canada with the songs &quot;I Think I Love You Too Much&quot; and &quot;How Long Can a Man Be Strong&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, Healey was raised in the city&#x27;s west end. He was adopted as an infant; his adoptive father was a firefighter. When he was almost one year old, Healey lost his sight due to retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eyes. His eyes had to be surgically removed, and he was given ocular prostheses.

==Early career and success==
Healey began playing guitar when he was three, developing his unique style of playing the instrument flat on his lap. At nine years old, his musical talents were showcased in an interview on the TVOntario children&#x27;s programme &quot;Cucumber&quot;. When he was 15, Healey formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece that primarily played bar-band cover tunes and featured bassist Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and schoolmate Rob Quail on second guitar. The band played at clubs in Toronto, including the Colonial Tavern.

Healey began hosting a jazz and blues show on radio station CIUT-FM, where he was known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm gramophone records.

Shortly thereafter he was introduced to bassist Joe Rockman (born January 1, 1957, Toronto) and drummer Tom Stephen (born February 2, 1955, New Brunswick – died February 20, 2023), with whom he formed a trio, the Jeff Healey Band. The band made their first public appearance at the Birds Nest, located upstairs at Chicago&#x27;s Diner on Queen Street West in Toronto. They received a write-up in Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW&quot; magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman&#x27;s Tavern and the famed blues club Albert&#x27;s Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert Collins).

After being signed to Arista Records in 1988, the band released the album &quot;See the Light&quot;, which appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart in 1989. It featured the hit single &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and the song &quot;Hideaway&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. While the band was recording &quot;See the Light&quot;, they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the Patrick Swayze film &quot;Road House&quot;. Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the Juno Award for Canadian Entertainer of the Year. The albums &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; and &quot;Feel This&quot; gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, which featured George Harrison and Jeff Lynne on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.

==Later work and life==

By the release of the 2000 album &quot;Get Me Some,&quot; Healey began to concentrate on jazz.

He went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances. His main jazz group for touring and recording was Jeff Healey&#x27;s Jazz Wizards.

Healey was an avid record collector and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 78 rpm records. Starting in 1990 he hosted a radio program of very early jazz on CIUT at the University of Toronto with Colin Bray. Later he went national on CBC Radio&#x27;s program entitled &quot;My Kind of Jazz&quot;, in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He moved the show two years later to Jazz FM – CJRT; as a part of ongoing celebrations for what would have been Healey&#x27;s 50th birthday in 2016, the latter program began to air in repeats Wednesdays 9pm on jazz.fm.
For many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, &quot;Healey&#x27;s&quot; on Bathurst Street in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a larger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened &quot;Jeff Healey&#x27;s Roadhouse.&quot; Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, &quot;Road House,&quot; in which Healey appeared.) At the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, with his other band, the Jeff Healey Blues Band (aka the &quot;Healey&#x27;s House Band&quot;) in April 2008.

Over the years, Healey toured and sat in with many well-known performers, including The Allman Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, B. B. King, ZZ Top, Steve Lukather, Eric Clapton and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan&#x27;s CD/DVD &quot;Gillan&#x27;s Inn.&quot;

Healey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including Alex Pangman, Terra Hazelton, Amanda Marshall, Shannon Curfman, and Philip Sayce

In early 2009, Healey&#x27;s album &quot;Mess of Blues&quot; won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.

In 2009, Healey was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame.

In June 2011, Woodford Park in Toronto was renamed Jeff Healey Park in his honour.

In 2014, Healey was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In September 2016, Jeff Healey was inducted into the Mississauga Music Walk of Fame. In March 2016 the posthumous album &quot;Heal My Soul&quot; was released, followed by the companion album &quot;Holding On&quot; in December of the same year. Both records were compiled by Roger Costa from unreleased recordings. The 12 track &quot;Heal My Soul&quot; featured six covers and a number of collaborations with Marti Frederiksen, Arnold Lanni and Stevie Salas. The 15 track &quot;Holding On&quot; album contains ten live tracks recorded in 1999 at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Norway and five studio tracks.

==Personal life==
Healey married Krista Miller in 1992; they had a daughter and were divorced in 1998. He married Cristie Hall in 2004 and had a son with her.

==Illness and death==
On January 11, 2007, Healey underwent surgery to remove metastatic cancer tissue from both lungs. In the previous 18 months, he had two sarcomas removed from his legs. On March 2, 2008, Healey died of sarcoma in his home town of Toronto at the age of 41. He was buried at Park Lawn Cemetery, in Etobicoke, Ontario. Healey&#x27;s death came a month before the release of &quot;Mess of Blues&quot;, which was his first rock/blues album in eight years.

<text>Khövsgöl () is the northernmost of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia. The name is derived from Lake Khövsgöl.

==Geography and history==
The round-topped Tarvagatai, Bulnain and Erchim sub-ranges of the Khangai massif dominate the south and southwest of the largely mountainous province, and north and west of Lake Khövsgöl, lie the alpine Khoridol Saridag, Ulaan Taiga, and Mönkh Saridag mountains. The center and eastern parts of the province are less mountainous, but still hilly.

The region is well known in Mongolia for its natural environment, and Lake Khövsgöl is one of the country&#x27;s major tourist attractions. The largest forests of Mongolia are located around and to the north of the lake, extending the South Siberian taiga.

The aimag was founded in 1931. Khatgal was the administrative center until 1933; since then it has been Mörön.

==Population==
The region is home to many ethnic minority groups: Darkhad, Khotgoid, Uriankhai, Buriad, and Tsaatan. Both the Darkhad and Tsaatan are famous for their practice of shamanism.

==Economy==
In 2018, the province contributed to 1.84% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

===Livestock===
In 2007, the aimag was home to about 3.43 million heads of livestock, among them about 1,510,000 goats, 1,442,000 sheep, 322,000 cattle and yaks, 150,000 horses, 2,350 camels, and 652 reindeer.

==Transportation==

The Mörön Airport (ZMMN/MXV) has one paved runway. It offers regular flights from and to Ulaanbaatar, and also serves as intermediate stop into the western Aimags.

The Khatgal Airport (HTM) only runs scheduled flights from and to Ulaanbaatar in summer, offering a more direct approach to Lake Khövsgöl for the tourists.

The road distance from Mörön to Ulaanbaatar is 690 km. A new paved road finished in fall 2012 now connects Mörön to Khatgal on Lake Khövsgöl.

==Administrative subdivisions==


==Notable natives==
* Chingünjav, leader of an anti-Manchu rebellion in 1756/57;
* The Jalkhanz Khutagt Damdinbazar, a prime minister of Mongolia in the early 1920s;
* Öndör Gongor, a tall man with the gigantism condition in early-20th century Mongolia;
* Gelenkhüü, an inventor and hero of local folklore;
* Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, human rights advocate, first Mongolian to graduate from Stanford, first woman to join the Mongolian parliament;
* Bayarjargal, conservationist and founder of Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation;

Henning Haslund-Christensen, a Danish traveller and explorer, spent one or two years in a place that today is in Erdenebulgan sum in the early 1920s. Some locals believe that Alan Gua, an ancestor of Genghis Khan, hails from what is now Chandmani-Öndör.

<text>The Rassemblement pour l&#x27;alternative progressiste (, RAP; ) began as the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;alternative politique, a social movement founded in 1997 as an attempt to unite the progressive and leftist forces in Quebec, Canada. It presented seven independent candidates (including former trade union leader Michel Chartrand) in the 1998 Quebec provincial election, and became a political party in 2000.

In 2002, it joined with the Parti de la démocratie socialiste and the Parti communiste du Québec to form the Union des forces progressistes (UFP). In 2006, the UFP joined with the Option citoyenne social movement to form the Québec solidaire party.

<text>The flag of [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) consists of a dark blue field charged with a white compass rose emblem, with four white lines radiating from the four cardinal directions. Adopted three years after the creation of NATO, it has been the flag of NATO since October 14, 1953. The blue color symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean, while the circle stands for unity.

==History==

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established on April 4, 1949, when twelve nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty to counteract the threat from the Soviet Union. 
The first flag used by NATO was unveiled October 5, 1951, by Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who helped design it. The 1951 flag consisted of a green field with the coat of arms of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which still uses the flag. 

The first flag attracted criticism from US Congressman John Travers Wood, who condemned it as a &quot;strange and alien rag&quot; after an incident where the flag of the United States was allegedly replaced by the NATO flag in Norfolk, Virginia, the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.

NATO began looking for an emblem to differentiate it from SHAPE, a task handled by the newly formed Information Policy Working Group. After several discussions, it concluded that a flag for the organization containing its emblem was necessary, and that it would recommend this to the North Atlantic Council.
The council stipulated that the design had to be &quot;simple and striking,&quot; in addition to highlighting the &quot;peaceful purpose&quot; of the Treaty; several proposals were rejected. An emblem of NATO was finally adopted on October 14, 1953. The decision was announced by Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay – the first Secretary General of NATO – exactly two weeks later on October 28, where he also elaborated on the symbolism behind the chosen design. He described the flag as &quot;simple and inoffensive.&quot;

The modern flag was first hoisted on November 9, 1953, at the opening ceremony of the Atlantic Exhibition in Paris. However, little is known about the occasion, since no documentation of the speech delivered at the event exists.

==Design==
The colors of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The dark blue field represents the Atlantic Ocean, while the circle stands for unity among the member states of NATO. The compass rose symbolizes the direction towards the path of peace, the goal that member states strive for; it has been updated once.

<doc id="791251" wikidata="Q7737443" url="?curid=791251" title="The Graham Norton Effect">
<text>The Graham Norton Effect is a talk show hosted by the Irish comedian Graham Norton. The show aired on Comedy Central from June 24, 2004 to September 16, 2004.

&quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot; can be considered a spin-off to two previous shows hosted by Norton, including &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; and &quot;V Graham Norton&quot;. During the last part of Graham&#x27;s Channel 4 contract, Graham decided to film a new show, NY Graham Norton, in New York. &quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot; was filmed for Comedy Central later in the year. Since this show was specifically taped for an American audience, some of the games played in the show were previously played on &quot;NY Graham Norton&quot; or &quot;V Graham Norton&quot;. (For example, a game about the world&#x27;s worst bathing suits which was played in the Alan Cumming episode was originally played during a V episode with Bo Derek, tying into her movie &quot;10&quot;.) Also, some of the guests, who were only on &quot;NY Graham Norton&quot; a couple of months previous, appear again on &quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot;.

The show earned abysmal reception and was cancelled after one season. Reflecting on the show in 2012, Norton remarked: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like we were a flop. ... We got our run, we did decent business for them [Comedy Central], we just weren&#x27;t recommissioned. So it was kind of a non-story. But we certainly weren&#x27;t the breakout hit they&#x27;d hoped we&#x27;d be.&quot;

==List of celebrity guests==
==List of games and events==
&quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot;, like all of Norton&#x27;s shows, featured games and side attractions that often involved his guests. These side attractions usually relied on audience member participation. The guests would then take part in the event by guessing or choosing something based about the usually inane parameters Norton had defined about the game. For example, when playing &quot;Guess the Partner&quot;, the guests would attempt to guess which two audience member participants were lovers based on physical features alone.

On occasion, Norton would even go so far as to secretly produce a pre-selected audience member’s parents or lover to witness or take part in an embarrassing event without the audience member’s knowledge.
* Episode 1: &quot;Guess the Partner&quot;: Guests attempt to match lovers with their partners. &quot;Barfly&quot;: Sandra Bernhard provides a remote voice for a life-size mannequin sitting at a neighborhood bar, to the confusion of other patrons.
* Episode 2: &quot;Ass Makeover&quot;: Audience members make over their male partner&#x27;s buttocks to resemble celebrities, such as Pamela Anderson, Michael Jackson and Bill Clinton.
* Episode 3: Audience members model regrettable swimwear.
* Episode 4: &quot;Find The Lady&quot;: Guests attempt to identify which silhouette of four audience members is a woman from a group including three men in drag; the least feminine is sent to the streets to proposition men using pickup lines fed by RuPaul. &quot;Date Jesus&quot;: Norton sets up an audience member on a date with a Jesus impersonator. &quot;Lovers Line-up&quot;: Guests and audience members guess when participants last had sex by shouting “higher” or “lower”.
* Episode 5: Sharon Stone is sung to by a fan over the phone. Audience members are called on to tell suggestive pick-up lines to the episode&#x27;s guests.
* Episode 6: Guests attempt to guess if a man is gay by the way he dances. &quot;In the Dugout&quot;: Audience members and guests try to guess what base participants reached with other participants. &quot;Candle-schticks&quot;: Audience members volunteer to make multi-colored candles molded from their male anatomy, which are placed on a cake and wheeled out by Joan Rivers. Graham interviews candle owners by name, asking &quot;My god, what happened here?&quot;
* Episode 7: Audience members attempt to guess which disguised participant is their lover by how they perform with a sex doll. Jade Esteban Estrada gets spanked by a dominatrix.
* Episode 8: A sexual euphemism contest takes place.
* Episode 9: Audience members reveal lies they have told to their parents. Carson Kressley talks about the man he&#x27;d most like to make over on &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;.
* Episode 10: Graham holds a parody of the Summer Olympic Games in the streets. Graham gets an audience member to dress as an Adult Baby and puts his photo on the fetish site DailyDiapers.com.
* Episode 11: A George W. Bush impersonator is on the show. Audience members are asked to campaign for something close to them with mostly insipid results.
* Episode 12: Chris Rock gives Marilyn Manson marriage advice.
* Episode 13: Graham, perhaps in a mockery of Oprah Winfrey, makes audience members&#x27; dreams “come true” with less than perfect results.

==DVD releases==
&quot;The Graham Norton Effect&quot; was released in its entirety (i.e. complete episodes, not a compilation) across two 2-disc DVD boxsets in Australia on 5 April 2005. The first set, titled &#x27;Series 1/Part 1&#x27; contains the first seven episodes and the second, titled &#x27;Series 1/Part 2&#x27; contains the final six. They were released on the Hopscotch Entertainment label.

Unlike the American Comedy Central broadcasts, the episodes on the DVDs are more or less uncensored, apart for things on Graham&#x27;s computer monitor that were pre-censored during taping. Language that was bleeped by Comedy Central is presented un-bleeped and the nudity is presented un-obscured. On the DVDs, however, none of the episodes contain their ending credit rolls. They simply end with the SO Television endboard after Graham signs off.

<text>Swingline is a division of ACCO Brands Corporation that specializes in manufacturing staplers and hole punches. From its foundation in 1925, the company was located in Long Island City, Queens, New York, United States, until the plant was moved to Nogales, Mexico, in 1999.

== History ==


Swingline was founded in 1925 in New York City by Jack Linsky. At that time, it was known as the Parrot Speed Fastener Company and opened its first manufacturing facilities on Varick Street, and in Long Island City in 1931. Eight years later the company changed its name to Speed Products and created the first top-opening stapler, allowing easy refilling of a full strip of staples. The design of this stapler, called the &quot;Swingline&quot; in 1935, eventually became the industry standard. In 1956 the company was renamed Swingline, and in 1968 introduced the Swingline 747, their most popular model yet. It was then sold to American Brands for $210 million in 1970. At the time of the sale, Jack Linsky was president and chairman and his wife Belle Linsky was treasurer. They owned 19 percent of the stock. Swingline became a division of ACCO, under Fortune Brands, in 1987.

For decades, the Swingline sign on the Long Island City building, measuring 60 feet high and 50 feet wide, became a local landmark visible to travelers on highways and trains between Manhattan and Long Island. 

In 1999 Acco closed Swingline&#x27;s Long Island City plant, which it had occupied for fifty years, and moved production to Nogales, Mexico. About 450 workers lost their jobs. At the time it was the largest single job loss in the city caused by the North American Free Trade Agreement. When the closing was announced in 1997, Acco was criticized by New York&#x27;s mayor, Rudy Giuliani, who said the city could do without a company that did not want to pay workers an adequate wage.
A custom-painted red Swingline 646 stapler was prominently featured in the 1999 comedy movie &quot;Office Space&quot;. In 2002, Swingline introduced an official red model (only this time a model 747), in response to an increased demand from fans of the film.

== Management ==
The company&#x27;s founder and longtime president, Jack Linsky, was born to a Jewish family in northern Russia, one of seven children. His father Zus was a fabric peddler. Preceded by Zus, the family emigrated to New York&#x27;s Lower East Side in 1904. He found work at a stationery store at the age of 14, and by 17 he was a salesman. He then launched his own wholesale business, Jaclin Stationery, which imported German-made staplers. A trip to Europe in the 1920s inspired Linsky to create an &quot;open channel&quot; stapler not requiring a screwdriver to open to insert staples.

Linsky&#x27;s wife Belle Linsky, who was born in Kyiv, became an avid art collector along with her husband.

<doc id="791254" wikidata="Q1137354" url="?curid=791254" title="Steel Wheels">
<text>Steel Wheels is the nineteenth U.K. and twenty-first U.S. studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 29 August 1989 in the US and on 11 September in the UK. It was the final album of new material that the band recorded for Columbia Records.

Hailed as a major comeback upon its release, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; is notable for the patching up of the working relationship between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, a reversion to a more classic style of music and the launching of the band&#x27;s biggest world tour to date. It is also the final full-length studio album to involve long-time bassist Bill Wyman, preceding the announcement of his departure in January 1993. Wyman&#x27;s final tenure with the band would be on two studio tracks for the 1991 album &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; was also the first album not to feature former member and frequent contributor on piano Ian Stewart, who died shortly before the release of their previous album &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. It was produced by Richards and Jagger, along with Chris Kimsey, who had previously produced the Stones&#x27; 1983 &quot;Undercover&quot;.

After the relative disappointment of their prior two albums, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; was a hit, reaching multi-platinum status in the United States, Top 5 status in numerous markets around the world, and spawning two hit singles: &quot;Mixed Emotions&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United States, and &quot;Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, the band&#x27;s last Top-40 hit in the US. Critics were generally lukewarm towards the album, exemplified by Stephen Thomas Erlewine: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make for a great Stones album, but it&#x27;s not bad, and it feels like a comeback.&quot;

==Background==
Following the release of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, and Jagger&#x27;s pursuit of a solo career, relations between him and the Stones-committed Richards worsened considerably. While Jagger released the tepidly received &quot;Primitive Cool&quot; in 1987, Richards recorded &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot;, his solo debut, released in 1988 to positive reviews. The two years apart appeared to have healed the wounds sufficiently to begin resurrecting their partnership and band. Ronnie Wood said of &quot;Steel Wheels&quot;: &quot;It’s the album that united the band again, after a three year hiatus that was almost permanent&quot;.

Meeting in January 1989, just preceding the Stones&#x27; induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with the chemistry between Jagger and Richards reasserting itself, &quot;their differences were ultimately overcome by the power of their long partnership&quot;. After composing some 50 songs in a matter of weeks, Ronnie Wood, Wyman and Charlie Watts were called in to begin recording what would become &quot;Steel Wheels&quot;, beckoning &quot;Undercover&quot; co-producer Chris Kimsey to perform the same role. 

Recording in Montserrat and London during the spring, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; was designed to emulate a classic Rolling Stones sound. One notable exception was &quot;Continental Drift&quot;, an Eastern-flavoured piece, with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar, recorded in June 1989 in Tangier, coordinated by Cherie Nutting. With much of the past disagreements behind them, sessions for &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; were fairly harmonious.

==Release and reception==

The massive, worldwide Steel Wheels Tour was launched in late August 1989, concurrently with &quot;Steel Wheels″&quot; arrival and the release of lead single &quot;Mixed Emotions,&quot; a partially biographical reference to Jagger and Richards&#x27; recent woes that proved to be the Rolling Stones&#x27; last major hit single in the United States, reaching No. 5. Critical reaction was warm, with &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; reaching No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in the US where it went double-platinum. Follow-up singles were &quot;Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, &quot;Almost Hear You Sigh&quot; and &quot;Terrifying&quot;.

The Steel Wheels Tour, which finished in mid-1990 after being re-titled the Urban Jungle Tour, was a financial success. In 1990, FOX aired a 3-D television special of the Steel Wheels tour. Unlike anaglyphic 3-D which requires the familiar red and green glasses, the method used was the Pulfrich Effect which permitted full-colour video. The film was shot by Gerald Marks of PullTime 3-D in NYC. An IMAX film of the tour was released the next year, which still plays sporadically at IMAX venues around the world.

Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes &quot;All the ambivalence, recriminations, attempted rapprochement and psychological one-upmanship evident on &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; testify that the Stones are right in the element that has historically spawned their best music – a murky, dangerously charged environment in which nothing is merely what it seems. Against all odds, and at this late date, the Stones have once again generated an album that will have the world dancing to deeply troubling, unresolved emotions.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes &quot;The Stones sound good, and Mick and Keith both get off a killer ballad apiece with &quot;Almost Hear You Sigh&quot; and &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, respectively. It doesn&#x27;t make for a great Stones album, but it&#x27;s not bad, and it feels like a comeback – which it was supposed to, after all.&quot;

In 2000 it was voted number 568 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

The album was the Rolling Stones&#x27; first digital recording. In 1994, &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. An SHM-CD version was released on 2 December 2015 by Universal Japan, mastered from the original British master tape.

<text>Lodovico Grossi da Viadana (usually Lodovico Viadana, though his family name was Grossi; c. 1560 – 2 May 1627) was an Italian composer, teacher, and Franciscan friar of the Order of Friars Minor Observants. He was the first significant figure to make use of the newly developed technique of figured bass, one of the musical devices which was to define the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the Baroque eras in music.

==Life==
He was born in Viadana, a town in the province of Mantua (Italy). According to a document dating from about 150 years after his death, he was a member of the Grossi family but took the name of his birth city, Viadana, when he entered the order of the Minor Observants prior to 1588. Though there is no contemporary evidence, it has been claimed that he studied with Costanzo Porta, becoming choirmaster at the cathedral in Mantua by 1594. In 1597 he went to Rome, and in 1602 he became choirmaster at the cathedral of San Luca in Mantua. He held a succession of posts at various cathedrals in Italy, including Concordia (near Venice), and Fano, on the east coast of Italy, where he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; from 1610 to 1612. For three years, from 1614 to 1617, he held a position in his religious order which covered the entire province of Bologna (including Ferrara, Mantua and Piacenza). By 1623 he had moved to Busseto, and later he worked at the convent of Santa Andrea, in Gualtieri, near Parma. He died in Gualtieri.

==Music and significance==
Viadana is important in the development of the early Baroque technique of basso continuo, and its notational method, known as figured bass. While he did not invent the method—figured basses occur in published sources from at least as early as 1597—he was the first to use it in a widely distributed collection of sacred music (&quot;Cento concerti con il basso continuo&quot;), which he published in Venice in 1602. Agostino Agazzari in 1607 published a treatise describing how to interpret the new figured bass, though it is clear that many performers had by this time already learned the new method, at least in the most progressive musical centers in Italy.
