<text>The Duchy of Teschen (), also Duchy of Cieszyn () or Duchy of Těšín (), was one of the Duchies of Silesia centered on Cieszyn () in Upper Silesia. It was split off the Silesian Duchy of Opole and Racibórz in 1281 during the feudal division of Poland and was ruled by Silesian dukes of the Piast dynasty from 1290 until the line became extinct with the death of Duchess Elizabeth Lucretia in 1653.

The ducal lands initially comprised former Lesser Polish territories east of the Biała River, which in about 1315 again split off as the Polish Duchy of Oświęcim, while the remaining duchy became a fiefdom of the Bohemian kings in 1327 and was incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown in 1348. While the bulk of Silesia was conquered by the Prussian king Frederick the Great in the Silesian Wars of 1740–1763, Teschen together with the duchies of Troppau (Opava), Krnov and Nysa remained with the Habsburg monarchy and merged into the Austrian Silesia crown land in 1849. The so-called &quot;commander line&quot; of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, a cadet branch descending from Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, held the title &quot;Duke of Teschen&quot; until 1918.

==History==
The duchy shared the history of the Cieszyn Silesia region, and also in part that of Silesia in general: the Teschen area was the south-easternmost part of the medieval Duchy of Silesia, a Polish province established upon the death of Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. According to his testament, the Silesian lands were to be ruled by his eldest son Władysław II, who became the progenitor of the Silesian Piasts. Though he was exiled by his younger half-brothers after he had tried to gain control over Poland as a whole, his sons, backed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, were able to return and to secure their Silesian inheritance. In 1172 they divided the heritage: the Upper Silesian lands with the Cieszyn area stretching up to the Beskid Mountains fell to the second son Mieszko I Tanglefoot, who ruled as Duke of Racibórz.

Defying the Polish agnatic seniority principle, Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1202 occupied the neighbouring Duchy of Opole from his nephew Henry the Bearded, forming the united Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. His descendants ruled Upper Silesia until the death of Mieszko&#x27;s grandson Duke Władysław Opolski in 1281, whereafter Opole-Racibórz was again divided among his four sons. The eldest, Mieszko, initially ruled the Duchy of Racibórz with Cieszyn and Oświęcim, jointly with his minor brother Przemysław. After another partition in 1290, Mieszko took his residence in Cieszyn and became the first Duke of Teschen.

===Piast rule===
Like most of his Silesian Piast relatives, Mieszko approached the kings of Bohemia; during the Polish internal struggles after the death of High Duke Leszek II, in 1291, he and his younger brother Duke Bolko I of Opole signed a support agreement with King Wenceslaus II. Mieszko also had the Teschen lands on the Vistula and Biała rivers and the Beskid foothills settled by German immigrants. He colonised the remote parts of his duchy and vested Cieszyn, Oświęcim, Zator, Skoczów and Karviná with town privileges. His adhered to the alliance with Bohemia even after in 1310 the House of Luxembourg assumed the throne in Prague.

After Mieszko&#x27;s death in 1315, his son Władysław took the lands east of the Biała river where he established the separate Duchy of Oświęcim, which eventually became a fief of the Polish Crown. His brother Casimir I retained the western part and in 1327 swore homage to King John of Bohemia. After that Teschen became an autonomous fiefdom of the Bohemian kings and part of the Crown of Bohemia. Local Piast rulers often possessed other lands outside the duchy itself, as the Duchy of Siewierz, half of Głogów and some parts of Bytom.

After the death of Duke Bolesław I in 1431, the rule over the duchy was shared by his wife Euphemia and their four sons. In 1442 the duchy was divided between the brothers who all bore the ducal title; nevertheless, the real control over the duchy passed to Boleslaus II and Przemyslaus II, who after the death of Boleslaus II in 1452 ruled alone. From the late 15th century onwards, the Beskid valleys in the south were settled by Vlach peasants from neighbouring Moravian Wallachia.

While the Lands of the Bohemian Crown passed to the Habsburg dynasty in 1526, the Duchy of Teschen during the reign of Duke Wenceslaus III Adam, from 1528 onwards, shifted to Protestantism. Influenced by the Moravian governor John of Pernstein, his tutor and father-in-law, he turned to the Lutheran faith in 1540 and his subjects had to follow according to the &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; rule. In 1560, still during his lifetime, he ceded the Duchy of Bielsko with Karviná and Frýdek to his son and heir Frederick Casimir. Nevertheless, Frederick died already in 1571 and his father, struggling with financial problems, had to sell Bielsko as a state country to the Princes of Pless. The remaining duchy passed to the only surviving son Adam Wenceslaus, who in 1610 shifted back to Roman Catholicism for the sake of political advantage and enacted several Counter-Reformation measures. Indeed, Emperor Matthias appointed him Silesian governor in 1617, however, he died a few months later.

The Cieszyn Piast rule continued until 1653, when the male line became extinct with the death of Adam Wenceslaus&#x27; son Frederick William amidst the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1625. The intentions of the Habsburg rulers to seize the duchy as a reverted fief were initially thwarted by his surviving sister, Duchess Elizabeth Lucretia, who began a lengthy lawsuit on her heritage. Nevertheless, when she died in 1653, the duchy passed directly to the Bohemian monarchs, at that time the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III and his son King Ferdinand IV.

===Habsburg rule===

Ferdinand IV ruled Teschen until his death in 1654, whereafter the duchy fell back to Emperor Ferdinand III. His Habsburg successors continued the re-Catholicization policies. In 1722 Emperor Charles VI separated Teschen from the Bohemian Crown and granted the duchy to Duke Leopold of Lorraine, whose son Francis I was to marry Charles&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa. Leopold had unsuccessfully claimed his maternal grandmother&#x27;s rights to the north Italian Duchy of Montferrat, which Charles had taken and given to the Dukes of Savoy in 1708 as part of their alliance pact. Once Holy Roman Emperor, Francis had to face the attack by the Prussian king Frederick the Great, who after the 1742 Peace of Breslau took the bulk of Silesia, while Teschen remained with the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1766 Teschen passed to Francis&#x27; eldest surviving daughter, Archduchess Maria Christina and her husband Prince Albert of Saxony, who thus became known colloquially as the Duke of Saxe-Teschen.

Although most of Silesia had passed to Prussia, Teschen with Bielsko and the duchies of Krnov (Jägerndorf), Opava (Troppau) and southern part of episcopal Nysa (Neisse) remained under Habsburg control and passed to the newly established Austrian Empire in 1804. Archduchess Maria Christina had died in 1798 and as her marriage remained childless, upon the death of the widowed Albert in 1822 the duchy passed to their adopted son, Archduke Charles of Austria, who assumed the title of &quot;Herzog von Teschen&quot; and became progenitor of the Teschen cadet branch of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty. While the Duchy of Teschen finally merged into the crown land of Austrian Silesia after the Revolutions of 1848, the ducal title passed down Charles&#x27; line, first to his eldest son, Archduke Albert, and then in 1895 to Albert Frederick&#x27;s nephew, Archduke Frederick.

With Austrian Silesia, the territory of Teschen became part of the Cisleithanian half of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy upon the Compromise of 1867. At the end of World War I both the crown land and the ducal title were disestablished with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary. Archduke Frederick, appointed Austrian field marshal in 1914 but soon neutralized by Chief-of-Staff Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, found his vast possessions expropriated and retired to Magyaróvár in Hungary.

===Aftermath===
At the end of the war, local Polish and Czechoslovak self-governments were established in the territory of Cieszyn, which on 5 November 1918 signed an interim agreement under which the territory – including the town of Cieszyn itself – was divided along the Olza (Olše, Olsa) River. However, the preliminary convention failed to settle the border conflict between the newly established state of Czechoslovakia and the Second Polish Republic, which claimed further areas of the former Cieszyn duchy with a predominantly Polish-speaking population. The ongoing conflict escalated when Czechoslovak troops crossed the Olza on 23 January 1919, starting the Polish–Czechoslovak War.

Clashes of arms continued until 31 January, but neither of the belligerents benefited: at the 1920 Spa Conference the division of the former duchy along the Olza was confirmed. The eastern part of Cieszyn Silesia was incorporated into the Polish Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship, while the western part (including the Trans-Olza region) became part of Czechoslovakia. This was confirmed on 5 August 1920 by the Conference of Ambassadors. After World War II the remaining German population was expelled.

==Demographics==

According to the Austrian census taken in 1910, the duchy had about 350,000 inhabitants: 54.8% Polish-speaking, 27.1% Czech-speaking and 18.1% German-speaking. While the Czech population mainly settled in the western areas around Frýdek, the German population was clustered around Bielsko ().

<doc id="789719" wikidata="Q459998" url="?curid=789719" title="Ichirō Ozawa">
<text>is a Japanese politician and has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1969, representing the Iwate 3rd district (Iwate 2nd district prior to the 1996 general election and Iwate 4th district prior to the 2017 general election). He is often dubbed the &quot;Shadow &quot;Shōgun&quot;&quot; due to his back-room influence.

He was initially a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), serving as its secretary general from 1989 to 1991. He left the LDP in 1993 and subsequently served as head of a number of other political parties, first by co-founding the Japan Renewal Party with Tsutomu Hata, which formed a short-lived coalition government with several other parties opposed to the LDP. Ozawa later served as president of the opposition New Frontier Party from 1995 to 1997, president of the Liberal Party from 1998 to 2003 (which was part of a coalition government with the LDP of Keizō Obuchi from 1999 to 2000), president of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) from 2006 to 2009 and secretary-general of the DPJ in government from 2009 to 2010.

In July 2012 he left the DPJ with around fifty followers to found the People&#x27;s Life First party in a protest against the DPJ&#x27;s plan to raise the Japanese consumption tax. Ozawa&#x27;s party merged with the newly founded Tomorrow Party of Japan of Shiga governor Yukiko Kada prior to the 2012 general election, in which the party performed poorly. Ozawa and his followers then left to form the Life Party.

== Early life ==
Ozawa was born in Tokyo on 24 May 1942. His father, Saeki, was a self-made businessman, who was elected to the House of Representatives from Iwate district. His family hails from Mizusawa, Iwate, which is also where the Emishi leader Aterui had his base.

Ozawa attended Keio University, graduating in 1967, and continued his postgraduate studies at Nihon University. He majored in law and intended to become an attorney. In May 1968, his father died of heart failure.

== Political career ==

=== Tanaka faction (1969–1987) ===

After his father&#x27;s death, Ozawa ran for his father&#x27;s seat in the 1969 general election, winning the seat at the age of 27. He held the seat, now known as the Iwate 4th district, until the 2021 general election, winning fourteen re-elections over more than four decades. Shortly after his initial election, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, temporarily lost his voice and considered resigning from politics, but he made a full recovery after undergoing surgery.

Ozawa joined the political faction led by Kakuei Tanaka, which then supported Prime Minister Eisaku Satō. Ozawa became one of Tanaka&#x27;s closest allies in the Diet. After Tanaka was charged in the Lockheed bribery scandals, Ozawa was the only faction member who attended each of Tanaka&#x27;s 191 court dates; Ozawa later commented that &quot;the man in power of the day, who took care of me, was made to sit on a bench all day long and I couldn&#x27;t bear if he was there alone with nobody around;&quot; he also characterized Tanaka as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; on the basis that other politicians were involved in similar activity.

Ozawa was appointed to lead the LDP&#x27;s election strategy in the 1983 general election, the first to employ a closed list system, and led the effort to elect Sadakazu Tanigaki and Hiromu Nonaka to fill open seats representing Kyoto Prefecture. By the 1980s, he became one of the popular young leaders in the LDP, along with Tsutomu Hata and Ryutaro Hashimoto, both of whom were later elected as prime ministers, in the Tanaka/Takeshita faction. His rivalry with Hashimoto was particularly prominent, being dubbed the Ichi-Ryu War by the press.

After long service on key parliamentary committees, Ozawa&#x27;s first ministerial appointment was in 1985 when he took on the Home Affairs portfolio under Yasuhiro Nakasone. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was impressed with his negotiation skills, particularly his ability to persuade opposition parties to pass difficult consumption tax legislation. Ozawa&#x27;s skill in behind-the-scenes maneuvers led to a meteoric rise in power within the LDP, although there were also many factions who turned against him. Senior leaders resented having to appeal to the much younger Ozawa for support. (Kiichi Miyazawa, twenty years his senior, once addressed Ozawa as &quot;Great Secretary General&quot; in a leadership meeting). Ozawa&#x27;s reputation for organisation was soon matched by his reputation as a young upstart.

=== Takeshita faction (1987–1993) ===

Ozawa joined the group led by Noboru Takeshita that left the Tanaka faction in 1987, shortly before Kakuei Tanaka suffered a stroke and was incapacitated. He became one of the key members of the faction, along with Keizo Obuchi and Ryutaro Hashimoto, both of whom later served as prime ministers.

Ozawa became deputy chairman of the Takeshita faction under Shin Kanemaru&#x27;s leadership, and became LDP Secretary General from 1989 to 1991. By 1991 Takeshita, Kanemaru and Ozawa were considered the three strongest members of the faction. However, Ozawa was hurt by a poor LDP showing in the Tokyo gubernatorial election of 1991 as well as heart problems that surfaced around that time.

Kanemaru stepped down in 1992, and Ozawa backed finance minister Tsutomu Hata to replace him. The faction&#x27;s eight member steering committee nominated Obuchi as chairman by a 5–0 vote, with Ozawa and two of his supporters having boycotted the meeting. Obuchi proposed reducing the faction leader&#x27;s degree of control over the faction in an attempt to keep Ozawa within the faction, but Ozawa began to plan his departure.

=== Split from the LDP (1993–1998) ===

In 1993, Ozawa and Hata left the LDP to form the splinter Japan Renewal Party, seriously destabilising the LDP and leading to the ending its 38–year dominance of Japanese politics. Ozawa was extremely successful in luring LDP members to the Renewal Party, causing the LDP to lose its majority in the Diet. In keeping with his previous LDP role, Ozawa became the behind-the-scenes power broker of the large coalition that took power in the wake of the LDP split.

While Ozawa and Hata were the most experienced administrators, they decided to name Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the tiny Japan New Party, as coalition leader. This was done both as a gesture of neutrality to the other coalition members, and as a means of keeping Hata in the wings as a future option if Hosokawa proved unsuccessful. While Hosokawa served as Prime Minister, Ozawa was recognised as the major political force in the coalition. He capitalised on his reputation in 1993 by publishing a clear statement of his principles in the book . The book called for political, legal and military reform to transform Japan into what Ozawa called a &quot;normal nation.&quot; Strong ideological consistency was uncommon in Japanese politicians, and the book had considerable impact.

Ozawa&#x27;s insistence on a more assertive role for Japan in international affairs caused friction with members of the Japan Socialist Party in the coalition. Eventually, the Socialists left to form a coalition with the LDP, leaving Tsutomu Hata in charge of a minority government that fell in June 1994. Many, including Hata, blamed Ozawa for the loss. Ozawa himself began to move into the public eye, especially with the arrival of the New Frontier Party. Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had founded the New Frontier Party in 1994. After joining the coalition, it became a catch-all party for the merger of several smaller parties.

After a bitter leadership struggle in 1995, Ozawa took over the party, just as his old rival Ryutaro Hashimoto was assuming leadership of the LDP. Most commentators believed that a new Ichi-Ryu War would finally provide a genuinely competitive two-party system in Japanese politics. Under Ozawa, the NFP made the second-strongest showing in the 1996 general election. However, the New Frontier Party was already beginning to unravel. Ozawa&#x27;s autocratic leadership style alienated many of his former allies, and even Tsutomu Hata, disillusioned after his leadership battle with Ozawa, seceded to form the Sun Party in 1996. By 1998, so many had abandoned Ozawa that he announced the dissolution of the New Frontier Party.

=== Liberal Party (1998–2002) ===

Upon the dissolution of the New Frontier Party, Ozawa took his remaining followers to found the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party formed a coalition with the LDP in 1999 to support Keizō Obuchi as prime minister. Obuchi began negotiating a future merger of the Liberal Party with the LDP. The idea of Ozawa returning was met with mixed reaction in the LDP. The YKK partnership of Taku Yamasaki, Junichiro Koizumi and Koichi Kato was strongly opposed to Ozawa, along with anti-reformer Hiromu Nonaka. Powerful faction leader Shizuka Kamei supported Ozawa, chiefly due to similar views on military reform. Eventually, Ozawa&#x27;s enemies were successful in blocking the merger.

===Democratic Party of Japan (2002–2012)===
Shut out of the LDP, Ozawa and his party joined the Democratic Party of Japan prior to the 2003 general election, reuniting with his old ally Tsutomu Hata under DPJ president Naoto Kan.

In 2004, Ozawa was affected by a pension scandal. Although cleared of any legal wrongdoing, he stepped down from the DPJ leadership elections, in which he had been unopposed. This forced Katsuya Okada to assume leadership of the party. Okada resigned after his party suffered dramatic losses against the increasingly popular Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in the September 2005 general election, and his successor Seiji Maehara resigned in April 2006. Ozawa was elected president again on 7 April. &quot;The Economist&quot; called Ozawa an &quot;increasingly ineffectual bully&quot; in July 2007 and partially blamed him both for enervating reformists in his own party and for DPJ failure to profit from LDP predicaments.
Nonetheless, Ozawa led the party to its largest victory in history in the upper house election on 29 July 2007. On 4 November 2007, Ozawa announced he would resign as leader of the DPJ, after a controversial proposal made by Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda about a grand coalition between the DPJ and the ruling LDP. He brought the proposal to a meeting of the DPJ leadership, which rejected it. He faced criticism for failing to immediately reject the proposal. At a news conference, he said that he took responsibility for this political turmoil. He also said that he was not leaving the party. There was speculation that the proposal originally came from Ozawa. However, Ozawa denied the press speculation except the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot;, and he said that they manipulated public opinion. It was reported that the power broker of the proposal was Yomiuri Shimbun&#x27;s executive director Tsuneo Watanabe. On 6 November 2007, he retracted his resignation offer after he was asked to stay on as leader by senior party officials and members.

The DPJ re-elected Ozawa as party leader for the third time on 21 September 2008. Ozawa stated on this occasion: &quot;I will do my best, considering this is my last chance to put an end to the LDP-led government and bring about a government that puts a priority on people&#x27;s lives.&quot; He was also announced by Secretary-General Yukio Hatoyama to have decided to switch from Iwate Constituency No. 4 to Tokyo Constituency No. 12 at the next House of Representatives election. On 24 September 2008, the House of Councillors, controlled by the DPJ, elected Ozawa as Prime Minister; however, the House of Representatives, controlled by the LDP, elected Taro Aso instead, overrode the upper house&#x27;s decision.
In 2009, Ozawa became implicated in the falsification of political funding reports on 400 million yen of campaign donations to his political organization. He resigned as DPJ president in May 2009, while the investigation was still ongoing, and was succeeded by Yukio Hatoyama. Nonetheless, during the August 2009 general election, Ozawa acted as the DPJ&#x27;s chief election strategist and remained a very powerful figure in the party. The DPJ won an overwhelming victory in the 2009 election and Hatoyama became prime minister, and it was believed that Ozawa&#x27;s influence would increase further.

The investigation into Ozawa&#x27;s finances continued despite the DPJ&#x27;s victory. By January 2010, two of Ozawa&#x27;s aides had been arrested and one poll found 70% public support for forcing Ozawa to leave office. A prosecution inquest panel concluded in April that &quot;it is highly likely that Ozawa is an accomplice and should therefore stand trial.&quot; Hatoyama and Ozawa announced their resignations as president and secretary general of the DPJ in June, due in part to the scandal as well as Hatoyama&#x27;s failure to keep a campaign pledge regarding US military bases in Okinawa. Their resignations were intended to save the DPJ&#x27;s chances in the House of Councillors election later that year.

Ozawa was formally indicted in January 2011 for his involvement in the scandal. The Tokyo District Court rejected most of the depositions taken by prosecutors in the case on procedural grounds, and Ozawa was eventually acquitted in April. Prosecutors appealed the case to the Tokyo High Court, which upheld Ozawa&#x27;s acquittal in November 2012.

===Post-DPJ (2012–present)===
After a disagreement with DPJ prime minister Yoshihiko Noda over a rise in the consumption tax, Ozawa left the DPJ along with 49 other lawmakers in July 2012. Later that month he formed the People&#x27;s Life First (PLF) party, which became the third largest party in the lower house of the Japanese Parliament. The focus of the new party was to reduce Japan&#x27;s reliance on nuclear power and to oppose the consumption tax increase.

Shortly before the 2012 general election, Ozawa and the members of PLF merged with the newly founded Tomorrow Party of Japan of Shiga governor Yukiko Kada. The party went into the election with 12 members in the upper house and 61 in the lower house, but performed poorly, with only nine members in the lower house being re-elected. The upper house members were not up for re-election.

Tensions grew within the party and on 29 December 2012 the Ozawa group split from the TPJ and formed the Life Party while suggesting continued corroboration between both parties. Tomoko Abe remained the only TPJ diet member, meaning that the TPJ could not maintain official party status in the diet, which requires five members. Abe and Kada sounded out Green Wind, which has four Diet members, over a possible merger, but the talks were not successful. After the Shiga prefectural assembly passed a resolution requesting Kada to stop doubling as governor and the head of the TPJ, she resigned as head of the party on 4 January 2013.

Long after he last held an influential party post, Ozawa remains widely respected in opposition circles. He is still frequently consulted by opposition party leaders for electoral and campaign strategy against the long-ruling LDP.

On 26 April 2019, Ozawa agreed to merge the Liberal Party into the Democratic Party for the People, which in turn merged into the Constitutional Democratic Party in 2020.

In the 2021 general election, Ozawa&#x27;s 53-year-long reign in Iwate Prefecture&#x27;s local electoral constituencies came to end after he was defeated by LDP opponent Takashi Fujiwara, who beat Ozawa with a 4.1% margin of victory. This came after Ozawa won in 2017 with a 14.84% margin of victory. Nonetheless, he did manage to stay in the House of Representatives through the Tohoku PR block.

In November 2023, Ozawa publicly said of CDP&#x27;s leader Kenta Izumi that &quot;It would be better if he resigns (as representative)&quot; following a statement by Izumi that he aimed to change the government within the next five years, with Ozawa criticizing the words and stating that &quot;What will the people think if the main opposition party says it won&#x27;t aim for the government? No one will support it.&quot; Earlier in the same year, he founded a parliamentary faction inside the CDP, leading to the belief that Ozawa is looking to build up his influence again in preparation of another opposition leadership election.

He has stated that, in light of the 2023–2024 Japanese slush fund scandal, people should not discount Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, saying that &quot;You have to be careful. You can&#x27;t let your guard down. Mr. Nikai is gone, the Seiwa-kai is in shreds, and the Secretary-General is useless. Why are you dissolving the House of Representatives right away when you are certain that you will be re-elected as President? There may be a disbandment in the fall after re-election. Before that happens, he may go to North Korea for the publicity.&quot;

Ozawa has also proven to be a critic of party leader Kenta Izumi, who he describes as &quot;unserious&quot;. He has described the need for election cooperation with the Japanese Communist Party, citing the need for a unification of opposition parties. He endorsed a former political opponent, Yoshihiko Noda, for leader of the CDP in 2024. After Noda was elected he made Ozawa his second-in-command in the Election Campaign Headquarters, putting Ozawa in a key position in preparing for the October 2024 general election. Ozawa won back his district in Iwate during the election, which saw the incumbent LDP-Komeito coalition lose its majority in the House of Representatives.

==Views==

Formerly known as a conservative politician in the LDP, he now takes liberal stances on domestic and international policies. The wide political spectrum in the Democratic Party forced Ozawa to take eclectic approaches, which has become a main source for criticism against him. Aside from his policies, he is also criticised for his aggressive power game tendencies in the reorganisation of Japanese political parties in the 1990s. Some critics accuse him of being an opportunist, and point to his repeated party movements. His defenders say that in the relatively ideology-free landscape of Japanese politics, it is his adherence to principle that forces him into conflict with others.

===Constitution===
Following its surrender on 2 September 1945, the Empire of Japan was deprived of sovereignty by the Allies, and the Meiji Constitution was suspended. During the Occupation of Japan, the Meiji Constitution was replaced by a new document, the postwar Constitution of Japan, which replaced the imperial rule with a form of Western-style liberal democracy. Ozawa claims that the Constitution of Japan is not a just constitution and that it is invalid. Ozawa pointed out Japan&#x27;s diplomatic disability in international affairs, particularly revealed in the Gulf War in 1990.

===Foreign relations===

Ozawa expressed admiration for American democracy and praised Americans for electing Barack Obama as president in an August 2010 speech, but he also labeled Americans as &quot;monocellular&quot; or &quot;simple-minded&quot; (単細胞 &quot;tan saibō&quot;). In the same speech, Ozawa said, &quot;I don&#x27;t like British people.&quot;

Ozawa characterized the War in Afghanistan as an American fight that &quot;had nothing to do with the United Nations or the international community.&quot; Ozawa published an article in the leftist monthly political magazine &quot;Sekai&quot; in October 2007, stating his intention to deploy the Japan Self-Defense Forces as part of the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghanistan if he ever assumes power in the new cabinet. The article was published as a rebuttal to a UN political officer who criticised Ozawa&#x27;s position to oppose Japan&#x27;s continual support of the maritime interdiction forces in the Indian Ocean. The article was published with the intent to provide a viable alternative to the government&#x27;s plan to continue stationing the Maritime Defense Forces for logistical support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. However, faced with mounting criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, Ozawa later softened his statement and explained that his intent was to deploy the GSDF (Ground Self-Defense Forces) for logistical support of the civilian component of ISAF, presumably suggesting the PRT or Provincial Reconstruction Team which is a civil-military cooperation unit that works on reconstruction efforts in the provincial areas of Afghanistan. On 24 February 2008, he stated that only the United States Seventh Fleet should be based in Japan. His remarks drew criticism from members of both the LDP and DPJ.

===Christianity===
In November 2009, while visiting the president of the Japan Buddhist Federation, Ozawa declared that Christianity is an &quot;exclusive and self-righteous religion&quot; and that &quot;European and U.S. societies with a background of Christianity are bogged down&quot;. He also stated that Islam &quot;is better than Christianity but it is also exclusive.&quot;

==Personal life==

Ozawa married Kazuko Fukuda, the daughter of a wealthy Tanaka supporter. With Kazuko, Ozawa fathered three sons who were raised in Iwate Prefecture. In June 2012, the magazine &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; published a letter from Kazuko stating that the couple would divorce, alleging that &quot;Ozawa ran away with his secretaries because of fear of radiation&quot; in the wake of the Fukushima disaster of March 2011.

<text>The Renault Alliance is a front-wheel drive, front-engine subcompact automobile manufactured and marketed in North America by American Motors Corporation (AMC) for model years 1983–1987. The Alliance and its subsequent hatchback variant, the Encore, were re-engineered Renault 9 &amp; 11 for the U.S. and Canadian markets.

Initially available in two- and four-door sedan configurations, three- and five-door hatchback variants (marketed as the Renault Encore) became available in 1984, and a convertible in 1985. AMC also marketed a sports version called Renault GTA for 1987. A total of 623,573 vehicles were manufactured in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Production was discontinued after Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC in 1987.

The Alliance and Encore derived from AMC&#x27;s 1979 partnership with Renault, which held controlling stake in AMC. The cars featured exterior styling by Robert Opron, director of Renault Styling, and interior design by AMC&#x27;s Dick Teague, with both the Alliance two-door sedan and the convertible body styles uniquely developed by AMC.

== History ==
Competition from the &quot;Big Three,&quot; the rise of Asian import automobiles, new safety regulations, the 1973 oil crisis, and 1979 energy crisis left American Motors in a weak position in the U.S. marketplace. The company had three product lines: a profitable line of government vehicles, Jeeps, and passenger cars. However, sales dropped suddenly in 1979 with a declining economy meaning all four of the U.S. automakers saw their sales plummet, but this decline was dangerous to AMC&#x27;s survival with only 2% share of the U.S. passenger car market.

Banks refused to provide AMC further credit to develop new products for the changing marketplace, so AMC turned to Renault for a $90 million loan. As the U.S. economy entered the early 1980s recession, AMC signed an agreement with Renault giving a share in AMC&#x27;s ownership in exchange for the rights to sell Renault cars in the U.S. During the time when Chrysler received US$1.5 billion in loan guarantees when Congress passed the &quot;Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979&quot;, AMC was not considered by lawmakers to be &quot;too big to fail&quot; and thus the smallest U.S. automaker sought assistance from the French government-owned company. By the end of 1980, Renault held a controlling interest of AMC. Some called it &quot;Franco-American Motors,&quot; a pun on the French-American combination and the Franco-American food company.

With the United States dollar then relatively weak against the French franc, manufacturing in the U.S. seemed the best way to grow especially since fuel prices were rising and the major U.S. carmakers had yet to bring out large numbers of small, fuel-efficient cars. Renault&#x27;s objective was to build its newer models at AMC&#x27;s existing manufacturing plants, thus avoiding the problems Volkswagen encountered with its &quot;Rabbit&quot; version of the Mk1 Golf assembled in its new factory in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania.

The two automakers worked closely as each design studio developed spin-offs of cars created by the other. Richard Teague, AMC&#x27;s Vice President of Design, and his French counterpart, Robert Opron, director of Renault Styling, each traveled between France and the U.S. at least three times a year. Originally only a four-door sedan body style, Teague and AMC&#x27;s design staff decided to mock-up a two-door coupe just before Opron was to review the work of the American team.

Renault executives came in to run things alongside AMC officials, and the venerable factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was retooled to produce an Americanized version of the Renault 9 subcompact under the &quot;Alliance&quot; nameplate. Consumer clinics were conducted between 1979 and 1982 using a fiberglass mockup (and later with actual cars) to evaluate various issues that concerned AMC officials. Market research indicated that consumers preferred the Renault name over AMC, though not strongly. The model was named the Renault Alliance, with the AMC logo only on a small sticker affixed on the inside of the rear window, as well as printed at the bottom or back of the advertising materials.

Production began in 1982, making Renault the second European automaker to build cars in the U.S. The cars were aimed at the lowest price range in the U.S. market, the two-door Alliance had a sticker price starting at $5,595. The European Car of the Year for 1982 was described as &quot;the bargain of the year in the U.S.&quot; for 1983.

== Model years ==



The Alliance was launched into the U.S. subcompact market segment against the Chevrolet Chevette/Pontiac 1000, Ford Escort/Mercury Lynx, Toyota Corolla E70, Volkswagen Rabbit, Chrysler twins Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon, Mazda GLC, Subaru DL, Nissan Sentra, and Honda Civic.

===1983===
The Alliance was a 2- or 4-door sedan, launched in June 1982 as a 1983 model after a US$150 million overhaul of AMC&#x27;s Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant. Although marketed as a Renault, the car carried AMC&#x27;s logo on a rear window decal and was officially classified as a domestic automobile as it was manufactured with more than 70% U.S.-produced parts.

The Alliance was a front-drive sedan with a overall length on a wheelbase featuring a thrifty, transverse four-cylinder engine. The Alliance had a long list of standard equipment and achieved in city driving. Fuel economy on the highway with the 5-speed manual transmission approached . It was a sensible car for a post-oil crisis period in which good fuel economy was highly prized.

The Alliance used a Renault supplied OHV 1.4 L I4 engine from the Renault Le Car. Cars sold in 49-states came with a Renix throttle-body fuel injection, while California emissions standards required the use of multi port injection. This four-cylinder was upgraded with the latest electronics that included an electronically controlled fuel system, a digital ignition system, and a microprocessor to manage the optional three-speed automatic transmission. Although Renault transmissions have been equipped with Renix based electronics and sensor assemblies, the all-new electronic controlled transmission system in the Alliance was an innovation to the U.S. mass-market.

Power went through either a four-or five-speed manual, or a three-speed automatic transaxle. The base engine produced to accelerate the Alliance from 0 to 60 mph in 14.3 seconds, and gave it an per hour top speed. Steering was rack and pinion. The suspension system was fully independent via MacPherson struts in front, while the rear had a compact and ingenious system of transverse torsion bars and trailing arms. At just under for the base model, the Alliance was also the lightest car assembled in the U.S. in its time.

The Alliance was slightly smaller on the outside than the competing first-generation Ford Escort (North America), but it was somewhat bigger on the inside where it looked larger and more inviting. Interior space was good for four or occasionally five people, in part due to a cleverly engineered front seats—where each seat was mounted on a wide central rail (rather than two side tracks) allowing for copious rear foot room on either side of the rail. In addition to the usual recline and fore-and-aft movements, the upscale DL models included a curved track that allowed the seat to be adjusted along the arc to find the most comfortable position for driver and passenger.

The Alliance sold well with over 142,000 of the debut 1983 models. Sales were limited by the availability of only two body styles. American Motors&#x27; had several 4-door Alliances converted into stretch limousines for publicity and official use.

===1984===
American Motors introduced a companion model called Encore featuring a hatchback in both two- and four-door versions. The new derivatives featured a redesigned rear end and were shorter than the Alliance sedans. &quot;More versatile and a little more luxurious than the Alliance,&quot; the marketing objective of the Encore was to attract younger and more &quot;upscale&quot; customers, but they were really the same cars. California engines featured a Bosch LU multi-point fuel-injection system. The 1984 models introduced innovative electronics that included an infrared remote power locking system, a &quot;Systems Sentry&quot; monitoring fluid levels, as well electronically tuned sound systems.

Bolstered by the additional two- and four-door hatchback models, sales increased to over 208,000 for 1984. While the financial fortunes of its French partner faltered, AMC recorded $7.4 million profit in fourth quarter of 1983, which a contrast to the previous 14 consecutive quarters of losses. According to Jose Dedeurwaerder, a Renault executive who became AMC&#x27;s president, 1984 was profitable for AMC on an annual basis for the first time since 1979 during which the automaker lost $637.6 million.

However, the new Encores were introduced just in time to encounter a sag in the small-car market because as fuel prices fell, consumers began to drift away to larger automobiles, leaving the Renault-based models to scramble against low-priced Chevrolet Chevettes (and their Pontiac 1000 cousins), Ford Escorts (and their Mercury Lynx cousins), the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon twins, as well as Japanese imports that were gaining popularity and market share.

===1985===
The 1.7 L fuel injection (EFI) engine with 5-speed transmission was introduced in 1985 as optional on all versions except the base model. It developed of torque at 3000 rpm and at 5000 rpm. Designed to be either gasoline or diesel, the new five main bearing engine was torture tested to higher levels than normal to be &quot;the strongest Four in the industry.&quot; The fully pressurized cooling system eliminated corrosive oxygen while engineers reduced the number of connections to avoid coolant leaks for both the 1.7 and 1.4 engines.

In addition to the sedan, the Alliance was now offered as a convertible for 1985 (AMC&#x27;s first of this body type since the 1968 Rebel). The design was in collaboration with American Sunroof Company (now American Specialty Cars) that reinforced the Alliance&#x27;s unibody for torsional rigidity during manufacture in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Potential buyers were asking at AMC/Jeep/Renault dealerships for an Alliance-based station wagon, who pointed them toward the larger Renault 18 Sportwagon.

By 1985, the U.S. automobile market was starting to move away from the subcompact Alliance and Encore as the gasoline crisis ended and consumers were buying larger cars. Increasing competition in the subcompact market segment from imported vehicles meant that total Alliance and Encore sales fell to 150,000 for 1985.

===1986===
Improving economic conditions and lower gasoline prices meant total sales dropped to 65,000 in 1986. American Motors had already stopped production of the Concord and Spirit in 1983 (the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle continued to be built), while the larger Medallion (to replace the Renault 18) was not going to be ready until 1987. The automaker offered zero-interest financing on the Alliance and Encore models in the fall of 1986. By mid-December 1986, around 2,000 hourly employees at its Kenosha factory were put on temporary layoff through the first week of January to balance inventory with sales of the Alliance.

===1987===
A separate model was added for the 1987 model year, the GTA that offered higher performance and its name recalled the Alpine GTA. All models received a front end facelift and featured new headlamps. The remainder of the Alliance line was carried over, but the two Encore hatchback body variants were renamed the Alliance Hatchback.

The government of French President François Mitterrand was concerned with an upcoming election at a time when Renault not only lost its number one automaker spot in Europe, but was also losing money. Moreover, while Georges Besse championed the opportunities in the North American market, Renault executives and labor leaders perceived AMC as a bottomless pit. On 9 March 1987, Chrysler agreed to buy Renault&#x27;s share in AMC, plus all the remaining shares, for about US$1.5 billion (US$ in dollars) and AMC&#x27;s operations became the new Jeep-Eagle division of Chrysler.

The focus of Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition was on the highly profitable Jeep vehicles and the brand-new Brampton Assembly plant that was just built in Ontario, Canada. In the first five months of 1987, only 13,390 Alliances were sold while inventory levels increased. Nevertheless, press kits were prepared for the 1988 models and early media reports of upcoming 1988 cars stated &quot;with the buy-out of American Motors, Chrysler will continue to market the subcompact Renault Alliance...&quot;

Alliance production at the Kenosha plant closed out as of Friday, 5 June 1987. The Alliance competed with Chrysler&#x27;s domestic and imported models such as the Dodge Omni, Shadow and Colt, as well as similar versions sold by Plymouth.

With AMC&#x27;s acquisition, Chrysler saw itself &quot;saddled with a largely unsuccessful assortment of cars&quot; including imports from Renault. Moreover, the Alliance line of passenger automobiles did not fit in Chrysler&#x27;s existing product mix. The final year saw about 35,000 Alliances sold in 1987.

==GTA==


The Renault GTA was a performance version of the Alliance for the 1987 model year. It was manufactured during 1986 and early 1987 as a limited production, specialty model. It was described as &quot;dandy little sports car&quot; and a &quot;pocket rocket&quot; defined as a low-priced &quot;car based on high production economy but with emphasis placed on appearance, performance and handling.&quot; It replicated what Volkswagen had done when the Rabbit was upgraded into the GTI.

The GTA was available in 2-door sedan or convertible versions, with a single powerplant: a 2.0 L fuel-injected 4-cylinder engine. At 4900 rpm with premium U.S. gasoline, this engine developed . Driving performance of the vehicle included a 10.2 second mark for 0 to 60 mph and a .89 g-force cornering rating in road tests conducted by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine.

The GTA used the same uni-body as the two-door Alliances, but was distinctive to the other models. It was available only in silver, white, red, or black monochrome body paint with special color-keyed &quot;ground effects&quot; bodyside cladding styled by Zender of West Germany, one of Europe&#x27;s leading after-market designers. It also featured 15-inch aluminum alloy sport wheels with low-profile Michelin Sport XGT 195-VR50 series tires, upgraded suspension with thicker sway bars, vented front disc brakes, larger exhaust pipe, optional driving lights, custom body moldings, a small spoiler on the rear trunk, red inlaid shift knob, close ratio gears on the manual transmission, stiffer engine mounts, larger brake booster, and special bolstered &quot;racing&quot; seats unique to the model. An automatic transmission was not available.
Road test of the GTA described it to be quite comfortable with responsive handling that &quot;was particularly impressive on tortuous back roads. It just hung in there like a sports car under the most trying conditions ... Hard acceleration will usually result in spinning wheels and a good deal of torque steer.&quot;

The GTA served as &quot;last-ditch&quot; sales boosters for the economical Alliance line. However, the models were discontinued when Chrysler bought AMC and Renault pulled out of the U.S. market.

== Reception ==
The Renault 9 was voted the 1982 European Car of the Year. It became France&#x27;s most popular car and Renault&#x27;s best selling model ever.

The Alliance was listed as number one on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; list of Ten Best cars for 1983. The magazine&#x27;s editors wrote that it &quot;represents a blending of compact dimensions, surprising creature comfort, excellent fuel economy, good looks and very pleasing over-the-road behavior.&quot; They noted, &quot;if we were some other magazine, this would be our car of the year.&quot;

The American-built, French-designed, Renault Alliance had a U.S. content of 72%. The engine, gearbox, and some axle parts come from France, thus qualifying it as a domestic vehicle, and making it the first car (in 1983) with a foreign nameplate to win the Motor Trend Car of the Year award. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; subsequently dropped the distinction between domestic and imported vehicles for the award in 2000.

A long-term test of a four-door Alliance by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; described the car as &quot;economical, well-built and has superb ride quality&quot; summarizing that &quot;it&#x27;s nearly perfect.&quot; The engine was smooth, refined, and built tight, but difficult to &quot;keep on cam&quot; with the automatic transmission. The suspension system was praised for its ability to cope with &quot;suspension-destruction&quot; roads at higher than normal speeds while providing good road feel with excellent handling and cornering – achieving .71 g-force on the skid pad with the small standard 175/70xR13 tires.

A 1983 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; survey of 1,000 owners said &quot;60% of our respondents rated the Alliance&#x27;s workmanship excellent. That&#x27;s a high figure for any car and considerably above the norm for U.S. built cars.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief, John Linkletter, addressed the findings that, &quot;the old canard about shoddy American craftsmanship suffers&quot; and that &quot;an American manufacturer and a foreign manufacturer can, in a combined effort, produce a very good car.&quot;

In 1983, &quot;Popular Science&quot; described that, &quot;Renault will find its reputation dramatically brightened when word of the AMC Alliance gets around.&quot; The report expanded, &quot;The new Alliance is a miracle for AMC. Not only does it show a general excellence in construction and appointments, it&#x27;s also a state-of-the-art front-wheel-drive that AMC could not have produced on its own. Combine those three elements and you have tough competition for the Escort, Chevette and Horizon and the imports, and a product that comes close to being the best in its class.&quot;

A 1983 report in the &quot;New York Times&quot; described, &quot;the Alliance&#x27;s appeal has brought AMC&#x27;s United States car sales 117.6 percent ahead of 1982 levels.&quot;

After a long-term road test conducted by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; of a four-door with a 1.7 L and automatic transmission setup in 1985, and summarized the experience as a &quot;faithful servant&quot;, but a &quot;generic no-frills car&quot; – except for the unusual steering wheel stalks – that &quot;nothing gave us pause&quot; with their &quot;compliant appliance&quot;.

By 1986, a &quot;Popular Science&quot; comparison with newly introduced Asian-built competing cars, the Renault Alliance was described as the oldest design, and &quot;felt the most refined.&quot; The road test noted the Renault did well in the tests with &quot;trunk and doors closed with an almost Mercedes-like clunk&quot; and &quot;the car&#x27;s excellent handling&quot; allowing to remain poised through potholes and &quot;stable when passed by large tractor-trailer trucks.&quot; The Alliance performed better than the new Hyundai Excel and that Renault &quot;dealers would be willing to negotiate on the final price.&quot;

In 1987, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported on the Alliance convertible in sports trim, saying &quot;the GTA package is really excellent, transforming the bland Alliance econobox into a veritable Pocket Rocket.&quot;

In 1987, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;despite the favorable early response to products like the Alliance and the Encore, the models failed to generate enough sales to prevent AMC&#x27;s share of the car market from declining to about 1 percent.&quot;

== Racing series ==
The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) spec-racing series Renault LeCar Cup was successful, and while relatively underpowered with its &quot;fuel sipping&quot; 1.4 L engine, the Alliance&#x27;s &quot;excellent&quot; ride and handling compared to the other small cars sold in America at the time, was an advantage that contributed to establishing the Alliance Cup in 1983. Modifications to the showroom stock cars were limited to fitting a roll cage, free flow exhaust, upgraded shock absorbers, as well as wider rims and tires.

The Alliance provided many donor parts (engine and suspension) for the Sports Renault race car, a single make series created by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) in 1984. Designed by Roy Lunn, it was a low-cost purpose-built racer. The car was developed and manufactured by Renault/Jeep Sport USA in Livonia, Michigan, under direction of Vic Elford; with more than five hundred were built. Most cars still exist, although the majority have been converted to use a Ford engine (thus now known as Spec Racer Fords), and run in the SCCA club-racing program.

== Legacy ==
The 1983 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award for the Renault Alliance was an industry-wide recognition that contributed to increased sales, as well as to AMC&#x27;s profits of about $15 million in 1984 (US$ in dollars).

The Alliance afforded AMC the opportunity to field a new compact car without the expense of its design and tooling, still the business relationship with Renault exacted a heavy price on the U.S. company. The automaker was required to shed its profitable AM General line of commercial and military vehicles because of U.S. Government regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning domestic military suppliers.

Automotive journalist Gary Witzenburg noted that the Alliance sedan&#x27;s &quot;excellent reputation and phenomenal first-year success&quot; caused AMC to stop production of its larger and older Spirit and Concord with the introduction of the new hatchback versions under a different name. The initial positive reception and the &quot;impressive&quot; sales total of 200,000 Alliances by the end of 1984 was later hindered by the market offer of only two models while the competition was offering with a wider range of cars for the market segments.

Renault failed to fully accommodate the European-origin cars to U.S. market demands. These included the Alliance&#x27;s less powerful engine whose output was further limited by the more demanding U.S. emission requirements, as well as the popularity of air conditioning in the U.S. when it was seldom ordered by European customers. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar also became &quot;very problematic in the mid-1980s&quot; due to the inflation and declining economy in the U.S., compared to French currency. Renault also did not consider the costs of manufacturing at AMC, and failed to &quot;properly support its distribution network&quot; because AMC&#x27;s U.S. dealerships were seldom brand exclusive. The mistakes in controlling &quot;the quality delivered by the distribution network&quot; resulted in &quot;disastrous&quot; consequences for the image of the automobiles, as well as increasing warranty costs.

The Alliance has the arguable distinction of being the car that saved AMC, while at the same time the cars possibly hastened the automaker&#x27;s disappearance as an independent company.

The Encore nameplate would reappear in the United States in 2013, this time on a small Buick SUV.

<doc id="789780" wikidata="Q679098" url="?curid=789780" title="Guillaume Dupuytren">
<text>Guillaume Dupuytren, Baron Dupuytren (, , ; 5 October 1777 – 8 February 1835) was a French anatomist and military surgeon. Although he gained much esteem for treating Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s hemorrhoids he is best known today for his description of Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, which is named after him and on which he first operated in 1831 and published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1834.

==Birth and education==
Guillaume Dupuytren was born in the town of Pierre-Buffière in the present-day department of Haute-Vienne.

He studied medicine at the newly established École de Médecine in Paris and was appointed prosector, by competition, when only eighteen years of age. His early studies were directed chiefly to anatomical pathology. In 1803 he was appointed assistant surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris, and in 1811 he became professor of operative surgery in succession to Raphael Bienvenu Sabatier. In 1816 he was appointed to the chair of clinical surgery and became head surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu, a post he held until his death. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Practice==
Dupuytren visited the Hôtel-Dieu morning and evening, each time performing several operations, lectured to vast throngs of students, gave advice to his outpatients and fulfilled the duties consequent upon one of the largest practices of modern times. By his indefatigable activity he amassed a fortune, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his daughter, with the deduction of considerable sums for the endowment of the anatomical chair in the École de Médecine and the establishment of a benevolent institution for distressed physicians. The most important of Dupuytren&#x27;s writings is his &quot;Treatise on Accidental Anus&quot;, in which he applied the principles laid down by John Hunter. In his operations he was remarkable for his skill and dexterity and for his great readiness of resource.

Dupuytren was one of the first surgeons to drain a brain abscess successfully using trepanation, in which a hole is cut in the skull, and he also used the method to treat seizures.

He claimed credit for originally describing melanoma and claimed Laennec stole the idea from his lectures.

He reported a case of breast cancer spontaneous remission in which, after the patient refused surgery, the tumour becoming enlarged, rupturing and becoming infected, it began to shrink and disappeared after a few weeks.

He died in Paris and there with his bequest established the Musée Dupuytren.

He was a brilliant teacher, an astute diagnostician and a gifted surgeon. On the other hand, he was extremely critical of students and colleagues who failed to live up to his exacting professional standards. This, along with his desire to be the best of the best, won him numerous critics, not all of them objective. He was described by such colourful epithets as &#x27;The Brigand of Hôtel-Dieu&#x27; by Jacques Lisfranc and &#x27;First among surgeons, least among men&#x27; by Pierre-François Percy.

==In fiction==
*The surgeon Desplein in Balzac&#x27;s short story &#x27;The Atheist&#x27;s Mass&#x27; is based on Dupuytren. 
*Dupuytren&#x27;s success at draining a cerebral abscess is referred to in Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;: &quot;not Dupuytren, about to open up an abscess through a thick encephalic layer&quot; (Part Two, Chapter 11).
*Reference is made in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;: &quot;Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ.&quot;
* In Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s fifth book of the Outlander series, &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;, pp. 1227–1229, Claire balances her future knowledge with current medical notes since the Baron Dupuytren has yet to be born.
* Stephen Maturin of the Aubrey–Maturin series received some of his medical training in Paris, conceding to have &quot;dissected with Dupuytren&quot; while there.

<text>In international law, a stateless person is someone who is &quot;not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law&quot;. Some stateless people are also refugees. However, not all refugees are stateless, and many people who are stateless have never crossed an international border. At the end of 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees published an estimation of 4.4 million people worldwide as either stateless or of undetermined nationality, 90,800 (+2%) more than at the end of 2021. However, the data itself is not complete due to how UNHCR does not have data from many countries, including lacking data from at least 22 countries where mass statelessness exists. The data also does not include de facto stateless people who have no legal identification to prove their nationality or legal existence. According to the World Bank, at least 850 million fit that category. Given that the legal concept of nationality prevails in practice, completely undocumented people fit the definition of being de facto stateless. 

The status of a person who might be stateless ultimately depends on the viewpoint of the state with respect to the individual or a group of people. In some cases, the state makes its view clear and explicit; in others, its viewpoint is harder to discern. In those cases, one may need to rely on &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence of the view of the state, which in turn may give rise to a presumption of statelessness.

== Causes ==
=== Conflict of law ===
Conflicting nationality laws are one of the main causes of &quot;stateless births&quot;. At birth, nationality is usually acquired through one of two modes, although many nations recognize both modes today:
* (&#x27;right of soil&#x27;) denotes a regime by which nationality is acquired through birth on the territory of the state. This is common in the Americas.
* (&#x27;right of blood&#x27;) is a regime by which nationality is acquired through descent, usually from a parent who is a national. Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania grant nationality at birth based upon the principle of .

A person who has neither parent eligible to transmit nationality by is &quot;born stateless&quot; if born in a state which does not recognize . For example, if that child were born in India and neither parent had naturalized yet, then the child would be stateless, since India confers nationality only to children born to at least one Indian parent.

=== Gender discrimination in &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; ===
Although most states allow the acquisition of nationality through parental descent irrespective of where the child is born, some do not allow female citizens to confer nationality to their children. As of 2022, women in 24 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, are legally restricted from transmitting their nationality onto their offspring. This can result in statelessness when the father is stateless, unknown, or otherwise unable to confer nationality to the child born to the unnaturalized mother in a foreign country without unrestricted birthright citizenship. Beginning around 2003, there have been changes in favor of sex neutrality in nationality laws in some nations, including reforms in Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal that may inform change elsewhere. For example, Algeria amended its nationality code in 2005 to grant Algerian nationality to children born in or outside Algeria to an Algerian mother or father. Moreover, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women prohibits sex-based discrimination in the conferral of nationality.

An important measure to prevent statelessness at birth bestows nationality to children born in a territory who would otherwise be stateless. This norm is stipulated in the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness; appears in several regional human rights treaties, including the American Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on Nationality, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child; and is implicit in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

=== Ethnicity ===
Many states define their body of citizens based on ethnicity, leading to the exclusion of large groups. This violates international laws against discrimination. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination stated on October 1, 2014, that the &quot;deprivation of citizenship on the basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin is a breach of States&#x27; obligations to ensure non-discriminatory enjoyment of the right to nationality&quot;.

=== State succession ===
In some cases, statelessness is a consequence of state succession. Some people become stateless when their state of nationality ceases to exist, or when the territory on which they live comes under the control of another state. This was the case after the Soviet Union had disintegrated in 1991, and also in the cases of Yugoslavia, East Pakistan and Ethiopia. According to the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, the Council of Europe Convention on the Avoidance of Statelessness in Relation to State Succession is the only treaty that aims to reduce this problem. Seven states have joined it.

=== Political or religious conflicts ===
Many Muslim or Christian Palestinians fled Israel from 1947–1950. In 1950, the newly formed state of Israel introduced a Law of return that gave Jews the right to become citizens with voting rights in the state of Israel only a short time after immigration to Israel. But the same right to return was not given by Israel to the many Palestinians who fled from 1947–1950, many of them become stateless. In December 1948 the UN approved United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which aimed at allowing return, &quot;that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date&quot;.

=== Administrative obstacles ===
People may also become stateless as a result of administrative and practical problems, especially when they are from a group whose nationality is questioned. Individuals might be entitled to citizenship but unable to undertake the necessary procedural steps. They may be required to pay excessive fees for documentation proving nationality, to provide documentation that is not available to them, or to meet unrealistic deadlines; or they may face geographic or literacy barriers.

In disruptive conflict or post-conflict situations, many people find that difficulties in completing simple administrative procedures are exacerbated. Such obstacles may affect the ability of individuals to complete procedures such as birth registration, fundamental to the prevention of statelessness in children. Whilst birth registration alone does not confer citizenship on a child, the documentation of place of birth and parentage is instrumental in proving the link between an individual and a state for the acquisition of nationality. The United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) estimated in 2013 that 230 million children under the age of 5 have not been registered.

Not holding proof of nationality—being &quot;undocumented&quot;—is not the same as being stateless, but the lack of identity documents such as a birth certificate can lead to statelessness. Millions of people live, or have lived, their entire lives with no documents, without their nationality ever being questioned.

Two factors are of particular importance:
* whether the nationality in question was acquired automatically or through some form of registration
* whether the person has ever been denied documents on the basis that they are not a national.
If nationality is acquired automatically, the person is a national regardless of documentation status (although in practice, the person may face problems accessing certain rights and services because they are undocumented, not because they are stateless). If registration is required, then the person is not a national until that process has been completed.

As a practical matter, the longer a person is undocumented, the greater the likelihood that they will end up in a situation where no state recognizes them as a national.

=== Renunciation ===
In rare cases, individuals may become stateless upon renouncing their citizenship (e.g., &quot;world citizen&quot; Garry Davis and, from 1896 to 1901, Albert Einstein, who, in January 1896, at the age of 16, was released from his Württemberg citizenship after, with his father&#x27;s help, filing a petition to that effect; in February 1901 his application for Swiss citizenship was accepted). People who subscribe to Voluntaryist, Agorist, or some other philosophical, political, or religious beliefs may desire or seek statelessness (ideological statelessness). Many states do not allow citizens to renounce their nationality unless they acquire another. However, consular officials are unlikely to be familiar with the citizenship laws of all countries, so there may still be situations where renunciation leads to effective statelessness.
Some may even desire statelessness to avoid future military duties by having a citizenship, to avoid citizenship-based taxation practiced by countries like the US, and to avoid Chinese censorship abroad as Chinese citizens living abroad have been subject to threats to their employment, education, pension, and business opportunities if they engage in expression critical of the Chinese government or its policies.

=== Non-state territories ===
Only states can have nationals, and people of non-state territories may be stateless. This includes for instance residents of occupied territories where statehood never emerged in the first place, has ceased to exist and/or is largely unrecognized. Examples include the Western Sahara region. People who are recognized to be citizens by the government of an unrecognized country may not consider themselves stateless, but nevertheless may be widely regarded as such especially if other countries refuse to honor passports issued by an unrecognized state.

=== Stateless nations ===
A stateless nation is an ethnic group or nation that does not possess its own state. The term &quot;stateless&quot; implies that the group &quot;should have&quot; such a state (country). The term was coined in 1983 by the political scientist Jacques Leruez in his book &quot;L&#x27;Écosse, une nation sans État&quot; about the peculiar position of Scotland within the British state. It was later adopted and popularized by Scottish scholars such as David McCrone, Michael Keating and T. M. Devine. A notable contemporary example of a stateless nation is the Kurds. The Kurdish population is estimated to be between 30 and 45 million, but they do not have a recognized sovereign state. Members of stateless nations are often not necessarily personally stateless as individuals, as they are frequently recognized as citizens of one or more recognized state(s).

== History ==

While statelessness in some form has existed continuously throughout human history, the international community has only been concerned with its eradication since the middle of the 20th century. In 1954, the United Nations adopted the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, which provides a framework for the protection of stateless people. Seven years later, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. In addition, a range of regional and international human rights treaties guarantee a right to nationality, with special protections for certain groups, including stateless persons.

===In antiquity===

In a historical sense, statelessness could reasonably be considered to be the default human condition that existed universally from the evolution of human species to the emergence of the first human civilizations. Historically in every inhabited region on Earth, prior the emergence of states as polities humans organized into tribal groups. In the absence of written laws, people living in tribal settings were typically expected to adhere to tribal customs and owed allegiance to their tribe and/or tribal leaders. As states began to form, a distinction developed between those who had some form of legal attachment to a more complex polity recognized to be a state in contrast to those who did not. The latter, often living in tribes and in regions not yet organized into and/or conquered by more powerful states, would widely be considered to be stateless in a modern sense. Historically, there is considerable correlation between those who would meet the modern definition of statelessness and those the contemporary ruling classes of the extant states would have deemed to be mere barbarians.

However, civilizations of this period more often distinguished between a subject and a slave as opposed to between a citizen and a subject. In many monarchies, the concept of citizenship as something distinct from that of a subject did not exist – people under a monarch&#x27;s rule who were considered subjects typically enjoyed more rights than a slave, and would presumably not have been considered &quot;stateless&quot; by the monarch. But even slaves in a monarchical state were often considered to have a legal status more desirable, at least from the perspective of the ruler, compared to those living outside the frontiers in tribal settings who were typically regarded as barbarians. Depending on the circumstances, a monarch seeking to conquer a frontier region would seek to either &quot;subjugate&quot; or &quot;enslave&quot; the inhabitants, but either would impart on the conquered population a change from stateless barbarian to some form of legal status in which allegiance and/or obedience to the ruler could be expected.

With the emergence of the concept of citizenship in the Greco-Roman world, the status of slaves and inhabitants of conquered territories during Classical antiquity became in some ways analogous to contemporary statelessness. In antiquity, such &quot;statelessness&quot; affected captive and subject populations denied full citizenship, including those enslaved (e.g., conquered populations excluded from Roman citizenship, such as the Gauls immediately following the Gallic Wars, or the Israelites under Babylonian captivity). However, there was a major difference between captive and subject populations in contrast to those living outside the boundaries of cohesive states – while both could be considered stateless, the latter typically only needed to adhere to local tribal customs whereas the former were not only expected to obey the laws of the state they were living in, but were often subjected to laws not imposed on and punishments not inflicted on full citizens. Among the more widely-known examples of this was the Romans&#x27; frequent use of crucifixion to punish Roman subjects, considered to be a highly degrading form of capital punishment that could not legally be inflicted on Roman citizens.

=== Before World War II ===

Some characteristics of statelessness could be observed among apostates and slaves in Islamic society (the former shunned for rejecting their religious birth identity, the latter having been separated from that identity and subsumed into an underclass). Statelessness also used to characterize the Romani people, whose traditional nomadic lifestyles meant that they traveled across lands claimed by others.

The Nansen International Office for Refugees was an international organization of the League of Nations in charge of refugees from 1930 to 1939. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. Nansen passports, designed in 1922 by founder Fridtjof Nansen, were internationally recognized identity cards issued to stateless refugees. In 1942, they were honored by governments in 52 countries.

Many Jews became stateless before and during the Holocaust, because the Nuremberg laws of 1935 stripped them of their German citizenship.

=== After World War II ===
The United Nations (UN) was set up in 1945, immediately after the end of World War II. From its inception, the UN had to deal with the mass atrocities of the war, including the huge refugee populations across Europe. To address the nationality and legal status of these refugees, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) requested that the UN Secretary-General carry out a study of statelessness in 1948.

In 1948, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted. It provided both a right to asylum (Article 14) and a right to nationality (Article 15). The declaration also expressly prohibited arbitrary deprivation of nationality, which had affected many of the wartime refugees.

In 1949, the International Law Commission put &quot;Nationality, including statelessness&quot;, on its list of topics of international law provisionally selected for codification. In 1950, at the behest of ECOSOC, that item was given priority, and ECOSOC appointed an ad hoc Committee on Refugees and Stateless People to draft a convention. A treaty on refugees was prepared with a draft protocol addressing the status of stateless persons.

The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was adopted on July 28, 1951. As of January 2005, it had attracted the signatures of 145 state parties. 

The International Law Commission, at its fifth session in 1953, produced both a Draft Convention on the Elimination of Future Statelessness and a Draft Convention on the Reduction of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts. In 1954, the UN adopted the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. This convention provided a definition of a stateless person (which has since become part of customary international law, according to the International Law Commission) and set out a number of rights that stateless persons should enjoy. The convention thus became the basis for an international protection regime for stateless persons. However, to ensure that the rights enumerated in the convention are protected, states need to be able to identify stateless individuals.

Seven years later, in 1961—only one year after the 1954 convention entered into force—the UN adopted the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

In 2014, following a series of expert meetings, UNHCR issued a Handbook on Protection of Stateless Persons.

Stateless refugees covered by the 1951 convention should be treated in accordance with international refugee laws. As of September 1, 2015, 86 states were party to the 1954 convention, up from 65 when UNHCR launched its conventions campaign in 2011.

=== Statelessness since 1961 ===
On December 13, 1975, the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness entered into force. It provides a number of standards regarding acquisition and loss of nationality, including automatic loss, renunciation, and deprivation of nationality.

In 1974, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) requested that UNHCR undertake the functions established by the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. While the convention had only 37 state parties on January 1, 2011, 33 states pledged to accede to it at a ministerial event organized by UNHCR in December 2011. As of September 1, 2015, the number of state parties had increased to 64.

States bound by the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child are obligated to ensure that every child acquires a nationality. The convention requires states to implement this provision in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless, and in a manner that is in the best interests of the child.

Starting in 1994, the UNHCR Executive Committee (ExCom) and the UNGA asked UNHCR to broaden its activities concerning statelessness to include all states. In 1996, UNHCR was asked by the UNGA to actively promote accessions to the 1954 and 1961 conventions, as well as to provide interested states with technical and advisory services pertaining to the preparation and implementation of nationality legislation.

An internal evaluation released in 2001 suggested that UNHCR had done little to exercise its mandate on statelessness. Only two individuals were tasked with overseeing work in that area at UNHCR headquarters, though some field officers had been trained to address the issue. The evaluation also noted that there was no dedicated budget line.

Concerned organisations such as the Open Society Justice Initiative and Refugees International have called for UNHCR to dedicate more human and financial resources to statelessness. In 2006, a statelessness unit (now a statelessness section) was established in Geneva, and staffing has increased both in headquarters and in the field. As part of an overhaul of UNHCR&#x27;s budget structure in 2010, the budget dedicated to statelessness increased from approximately US$12 million in 2009 to $69.5 million in 2015.

In addition to regular staff in regional and country offices, UNHCR has regional statelessness officers in Dakar, Senegal, for West Africa; Nairobi, Kenya, for the Horn of Africa; Pretoria, South Africa, for Southern Africa; San José, Costa Rica, for the Americas; Bangkok, Thailand, for Asia and the Pacific; Almaty, Kazakhstan, for Central Asia; Brussels, Belgium, for Europe; and Amman, Jordan, for the Middle East and North Africa.

In 2004, ExCom instructed UNHCR to pay particular attention to situations of protracted statelessness and to explore, in cooperation with states, measures that would ameliorate and end these situations. In 2006, it provided UNHCR with more specific guidance on how to implement its mandate. The Conclusion on Identification, Prevention and Reduction of Statelessness and Protection of Stateless Persons requires UNHCR to work with governments, other UN agencies, and civil society to address statelessness. UNHCR&#x27;s activities are currently categorized as identification, prevention, reduction, and protection.

UNHCR has achieved some success with campaigns to prevent and reduce statelessness among peoples in the Crimean peninsula (Armenians, Crimean Tatars, Germans, and Greeks) who were deported &quot;en masse&quot; at the close of World War II. Another success has been the naturalization of Tajik refugees in Kyrgyzstan, as well as campaigns that have enabled 300,000 Tamils to acquire Sri Lankan citizenship. UNHCR also helped the Czech Republic reduce the large number of stateless persons created when it separated from Slovakia.

At the beginning of 2006, the UNHCR reported that it had records of 2.4 million stateless persons, and estimated that there were 11 million worldwide. By the end of 2014, UNHCR had identified close to 3.5 million stateless persons in 77 countries and estimated the total number worldwide to be more than 10 million.

UNHCR does not report refugee populations in its statelessness statistics to avoid double counting, which would affect the total number of &quot;persons of concern&quot;. Stateless refugees are counted as refugees, not as stateless. For the same reason, Palestinian refugees under the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) are not reported in the UNHCR statelessness table. Instead, they are referred to elsewhere in UNHCR&#x27;s statistical reporting.

While the two UN conventions on statelessness constitute the primary international framework for the protection of stateless persons and the reduction of statelessness, there are also regional instruments of great importance. The 1997 European Convention on Nationality, for example, has contributed to protecting the rights of stateless persons and provides standards for reducing statelessness in the Council of Europe region. That document emphasizes the need of every person to have a nationality, and seeks to clarify the rights and responsibilities of states in ensuring individual access to a nationality.

Some of the largest populations of stateless persons are found in Algeria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Estonia, India, Kenya, Latvia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Myanmar, Nepal, Brunei, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Thailand.

== Notable cases ==
=== Airports ===
Some stateless people have received widespread public attention in airports due to their status as ports of entry.

One famous case is that of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, who lived in Charles de Gaulle Airport in France for approximately 18 years after he was denied entry to the country. His Iranian passport and UN refugee documents had been stolen. He had a British mother, but he did not have British citizenship. The 1994 French film &quot;Tombés du ciel&quot; and the 2004 American film &quot;The Terminal&quot; are fictional stories inspired by his experiences.

=== During change of citizenship ===
Countries that restrict multiple nationality often require immigrants who apply for naturalisation to obtain official documentation from their countries of origin proving that they are no longer citizens. In others, including Taiwan, the documentation must be provided prior to the granting of citizenship. During the period between the cancellation of the prior citizenship and the granting of the new citizenship by naturalization, the applicant may be officially stateless. In two cases in Taiwan, Pakistani immigrants applied for naturalization and renounced their Pakistani citizenship. In the interim, the decisions to permit their naturalization as citizens of Taiwan were reversed, leaving them stateless.

===Australia===
, Australia had 37 stateless people in onshore detention, who had been detained for an average of 2 years and 106 days and the longest was 3 years and 250 days. The number of stateless people in offshore detention is unknown. There were a further 57 stateless people living in the community after being approved for a residence determination. In Australia, statelessness is not itself a ground for grant of a visa and the person must instead rely upon other grounds, such as being a refugee. Notable cases include:

*Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait who was denied a visa on arrival in Australia in 2000 and did not meet the requirements of a refugee. Al-Kateb wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, Kuwait would not accept him (as he was not a Kuwait citizen or resident) and there was no state of Palestine recognized by Australia at that time. To return him to Gaza required the approval of Israel. The High Court of Australia held in &quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot; that his detention was lawful, even though it would continue indefinitely. Al-Kateb and eight other stateless people were granted bridging visas in 2005 and, while this meant they were released from detention, they were unable to work, study or obtain various government benefits. Al-Kateb was granted a permanent visa in October 2007.
*&#x27;Baby Ferouz&#x27; was born in November 2013 to Rohingya Muslim parents who had fled from Myanmar, which did not recognise them as citizens. His parents and siblings were being held at the Nauru Detention Centre, however the family was flown to Brisbane due to complications in pregnancy, with the result that baby Ferouz was born in Australia. From 1986, Australia has not automatically granted citizenship to people born in Australia, despite the provision in the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness requiring nationality to be given to children born in a territory who would otherwise be stateless. As baby Ferouz was deemed to be an unauthorised maritime arrival, he could not be given a protection visa. In December 2014 he and his family were given a temporary protection visa which allowed them to be released from immigration detention.
*Said Imasi is believed to be from Western Sahara and had been granted a protection visa in Norway in 2004. In January 2010 he had a one-way ticket to New Zealand and was traveling on a friend&#x27;s passport and was detained on a stop-over in Melbourne. His application for a refugee visa was refused because he did not have a &quot;well-founded fear of persecution&quot; in Norway. Because he has no visa to be in Australia and there is no country to which he can be returned, Imasi has been in immigration detention since January 2010, spending several years at the Christmas Island Detention Centre and later at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney. As of May 2023, Imasi has been released under unknown conditions.

===Bahrain===

Many individuals in Bahrain, called Bidoon, do not have a nationality. A number of people have also had their citizenship revoked and are now stateless; the revocation took place after they criticised the Bahraini government. This situation also occurs in other Middle Eastern countries.

=== Brazil ===

Brazil is among the few countries in the world to have in its law the recognition of a stateless person to provide documents to this person as an official citizen of the country. Maha and Souad Mamo, who had lived in Brazil for four years as refugees, were the first stateless persons recognized by the Brazilian state after the creation of the new migration law (Law No. 13,445), which came into force in 2017. The migration law provides protective measures for stateless persons, facilitating the guarantees of social inclusion and simplified naturalization for citizens without a homeland. The legislation follows international conventions of respect for stateless persons and seeks to reduce the number of people in this situation, giving the right to request nationality. Countries having similar laws usually offer stateless persons the access to basic rights such as education and health, while in their documents they are still recognized as stateless with a residence permit. With its law, Brazil offers naturalization, which means that these persons can by all effects become Brazilians. If the stateless persons do not wish to apply for immediate naturalization, they are granted at least definitive residency in the country.

=== Brunei ===
Many stateless permanent residents live in Brunei. Most have lived on Bruneian soil for generations, but Bruneian nationality is governed by the policy of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;; the right to hold it comes from blood ties. The government of Brunei has made obtaining citizenship possible, albeit difficult, for stateless persons who have inhabited Brunei for many generations. Requirements include rigorous tests in Malay culture, customs, and language. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given an International Certificate of Identity, which allows them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei&#x27;s Chinese and Indians are permanent residents who are stateless.

Holders of International Certificates of Identity can enter Germany and Hungary visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. In the case of Germany, in theory, for an individual to benefit from the visa exemption, the ICI must be issued under the terms of the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, and it must contain an authorization to return to Brunei with a sufficiently long period of validity.

Brunei is a signatory to the 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which states that &quot;the child shall be entitled from his birth to a name and a nationality&quot;, but it does not currently follow the guidelines of the convention. The Sultan of Brunei has announced changes that may expedite the process by which stateless persons with permanent residence status sit for citizenship exams.

=== Canada ===
An amendment to the Canadian Citizenship Act (S.C. 2008, c. 14, previously Bill C-37) came into effect on April 17, 2009, and changed the rules for the acquisition of foreign-born Canadian citizenship. Individuals born outside Canada can now become Canadian citizens by descent only if at least one of their parents was either a native-born citizen or a naturalised citizen of Canada.

The new law limits citizenship by descent to one generation born outside Canada. All individuals born within one generation of the native-born or naturalised citizen parent are automatically recognised as Canadian citizens, but second-generation descendants born abroad are no longer citizens of Canada at birth, and such individuals might be stateless if they have no claim to any other citizenship. Since the passage of Bill C-37, this situation has already occurred at least twice:
* Rachel Chandler was born in China, to a Libyan-born father who is a Canadian citizen through the provision in the above paragraph and a mother who is a Chinese citizen. Because of the nationality laws of Canada and China, she was not eligible for citizenship in either country and was apparently born stateless. However, because Chandler&#x27;s paternal grandfather was born in Ireland, she was entitled to Irish citizenship and now holds an Irish passport.
* Chloé Goldring was born in Belgium, to a Canadian father born in Bermuda and an Algerian mother. She was not eligible for automatic citizenship in Algeria, Belgium, or Canada, and was thus born stateless. Goldring is now a Canadian citizen.
Under Bill C-37, the term &quot;native-born&quot; is construed strictly: children born outside of Canada to Canadian government employees working abroad, including diplomats and Canadian Forces personnel, are considered foreign-born.

The bill was intended to resolve the status of so-called &quot;Lost Canadians&quot;—people who considered themselves Canadians, with undeniable connections to the country, but who had either lost or never been granted citizenship because of the vagaries of the country&#x27;s previous nationality law.

=== Dominican Republic ===
An estimated 800,000 Haitians reside in the Dominican Republic. For much of its history, the Dominican Republic had a &quot;jus soli&quot; policy, meaning that all children born in the country, even to undocumented parents, were automatically given citizenship. Most countries in the Western Hemisphere practice this policy, but in June 2013, the Dominican high court amended existing legislation to exclude from &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship children born &quot;in transit&quot;, such as the children of foreign diplomats and &quot;those on their way to another country&quot;. Since 2013, the law has been expanded to address the children of non-citizens, such as Haitian migrants who immigrated after 1929.

Since the passing of the amendment, nearly 200,000 Dominicans of Haitian descent have been stripped of their Dominican citizenship. Without birth certificates, identification, or nationality, they are stateless and living illegally in the Dominican Republic. As of July 2015, according to the International Organization for Migration, about 1,133 individuals had voluntarily or involuntarily relocated to Haiti. By law, many are eligible to apply for naturalised citizenship in either Haiti or the Dominican Republic, but financial, bureaucratic, and discriminatory obstacles have prevented many from doing so.

=== Estonia and Latvia ===

Estonia and Latvia, two neighboring European countries, were Russian Empire territories, separated upon independence in 1918, re-merged under Soviet occupation from 1940 until German occupation in 1941 and then again under renewed Soviet Occupation after 1944. When their independence was restored in 1991, citizenship was automatically restored to individuals who had been Latvian citizens prior to June 18, 1940, and their descendants or Estonian citizens prior to June 16, 1940, and their descendants. Citizens of the Soviet Union who had moved to Estonia or Latvia while they were part of the Soviet Union did not receive citizenship automatically in 1991, and neither did their descendants. They had to apply for naturalisation as immigrants, a process that included a knowledge test and a language test in Estonian or Latvian. Children born after Latvia re-established independence (August 21, 1991), to parents who are both non-citizens, are also entitled to citizenship at the request of at least one of the parents.

These criteria mainly excluded ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and other ethnic minorities. Thousands of ethnic Latvians and Estonians were also impacted and became stateless. Russia has a visa waiver for stateless persons living in Estonia and Latvia, while Estonian and Latvian citizens need to obtain a visa to enter Russia. These stateless persons can also travel freely within the Schengen area, but they are not permitted to work within the European Union. , more than 267,000 residents of Latvia and 91,000 residents of Estonia were stateless.

=== Greece ===
Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code (Law 3370 of 1955) stated: &quot;A person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek citizenship. This also applies to a person of non-Greek ethnic origin born and domiciled abroad. Minor children living abroad may be declared as having lost Greek citizenship if both their parents, or the surviving parent, have lost it as well.&quot; (The Minister of the Interior decides such cases, with the concurring opinion of the Citizenship Council.).

Article 19 was abolished in 1998, but no provision was established for restoring citizenship to people who had lost it. Interior Minister Alekos Papadopoulos stated that, since the article&#x27;s introduction in 1955, 60,000 Greeks had lost their citizenship because of it, many of these people moved and adopted the nationality of another country. However, an estimated 300–1,000 people remain stateless in Greece (primarily minorities in Thrace, some of whom never settled abroad) and other former Greek citizens are stateless outside the country (an estimated 1,400 in Turkey and an unknown number elsewhere).

Stateless individuals in Greece have had difficulty receiving social services like health care and education. Until December 1997, they were denied the protection of the 1954 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, which Greece ratified in 1975. Then, as a result of pressure from nongovernmental organizations and minority deputies, around 100 ethnic Turks made stateless under Article 19 received identity documents from Greek authorities in accordance with the 1954 U.N. Convention. In August 1998, Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos stated that within a year, most or all stateless persons living in Greece would be offered Greek citizenship; this promise was repeated in subsequent months by Alternate and Deputy Foreign Ministers George Papandreou and Giannos Kranidiotis. However, the government took no steps to carry out this promise.

=== Hong Kong ===

Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of China, does not have its own citizenship laws. The right of abode is the status that allows unrestricted right to live, work, vote and to hold most public office in Hong Kong; persons with right of abode in Hong Kong are called permanent residents. Most permanent residents of Chinese descent are Chinese citizens as provided by the Chinese nationality law. Citizens of other countries who have obtained right of abode in Hong Kong remain the citizens of their respective countries, and enjoy all the rights accorded to permanent residents except for those restricted to permanent residents with Chinese citizenship, such as the right to a HKSAR passport and the eligibility to be elected as the Chief Executive.

When Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom to China on July 1, 1997, all British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) connected to Hong Kong lost their British nationality, unless they had applied for the British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status. Most BDTCs of Chinese descent became Chinese citizens. BDTCs who did not become Chinese citizens and did not apply for BN(O) status while holding no other citizenship became British Overseas citizens (BOCs). As BN(O) and BOC statuses do not provide right of abode in the United Kingdom, BN(O)s and BOCs of non-Chinese descent who do not hold any other citizenship are &quot;de facto&quot; stateless. However, British nationality law allows BN(O)s and BOCs who are otherwise stateless to register for full British citizenship. In addition, the Chinese nationality law as applied in Hong Kong provides the option of naturalisation as a Chinese national.

Chinese citizens from the mainland who had migrated to Hong Kong on a One-way Permit lose their mainland hukou (household registration). They then must reside in Hong Kong for 7 years before gaining the right of abode in Hong Kong. Therefore, persons who had migrated out of the mainland but have not obtained Hong Kong permanent residency, while technically not stateless, are unable to exercise rights and privileges associated with citizenship in either the mainland or Hong Kong.

Stateless permanent residents of Hong Kong and Chinese migrants without right of abode may apply for a Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes, which allows them to travel overseas. This document (with few exceptions) requires the holder to apply for and receive a travel visa prior to departure from Hong Kong.

Children born to foreign domestic workers are not classified as citizens because Chinese nationality is determined by blood ties. Under the visa regulations governing foreign domestic workers, the government of Hong Kong may award an unconditional stay visa. Many of these children can obtain citizenship in their parents&#x27; country of birth. When they are put up for adoption, however, citizenship applications can become challenging. In cases where both adoptive parents are Chinese nationals, the children will likely remain stateless. Applying for Chinese citizenship by naturalisation is only possible for permanent residents of Hong Kong, and an unconditional stay visa does not grant this status.

Eliana Rubashkyn, a transgender woman and refugee, became &quot;de facto&quot; stateless in 2013 after being detained for over eight months on the grounds that her appearance did not match her passport photo. She suffered mistreatment in detention at Chek Lap Kok Airport and in Kowloon&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital. She was granted refugee status, but Hong Kong did not recognize her as a refugee because it is not a signatory to the refugee convention of 1951 and sought to deport her to Colombia. In 2013, the UN sought a third country to resettle her due to the lack of protections for LGBT people and refugees in Hong Kong. After almost one year, a UN declaration recognized her as a woman under international law, and she was sent to New Zealand, where she received asylum.

=== South Asia ===

As of 2012, India and Pakistan were each holding several hundred prisoners from the other for violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of espionage. Some of these prisoners have been denied citizenship in both countries, leaving them stateless. In Pakistani law, if one leaves the country for more than seven years without any registration from a Pakistani embassy or foreign mission of any country, they lose Pakistani citizenship.

In 2012, the BBC reported on the case of Muhammad Idrees, who lived in Pakistan and had been held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2–3 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999. He spent much of those 13 years in prison waiting for a hearing, sometimes homeless or living with volunteer families. Both states denied him citizenship.

The BBC linked these problems to the political atmosphere caused by the Kashmir conflict. The Indian People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties told the BBC it had worked on hundreds of cases with similar features. It called Idrees&#x27; case a &quot;violation of all human rights, national and international laws&quot;, adding, &quot;Everybody has a right to a nation.&quot; The Indian Human Rights Law Network blamed &quot;officials in the home department&quot; and slow courts, and called the case a &quot;miscarriage of justice, a shocking case&quot;.

In Bangladesh, about 300,000–500,000 Bihari people (also known as Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh) were rendered stateless when Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan in 1971. Bangladesh refused to consider them citizens because of their support for Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War while Pakistan insisted that since Bangladesh was successor state of East Pakistan, the new nation had a responsibility to absorb the Bihari people just as West Pakistan had done with refugees flooding from the war, including Bengali people. As a result, the Bihari people became stateless.

Over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, who have neither Bhutanese nor Nepalese citizenship, reside in Nepal.

=== Indonesia ===
In February 2020, the Indonesia government stated that any Indonesian national who ever joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had automatically lost their Indonesian citizenship. Presidential Chief of Staff Moeldoko stated that the ISIL sympathizers &quot;are stateless&quot;. Article 23 of Indonesian nationality law states that Indonesian nationals can lose their citizenship after, among other things, &quot;joining a foreign military or taking an oath of allegiance to another country&quot;.

=== Japan ===
When Japan lost control over Korea in 1945, those Koreans who remained in Japan received Chōsen-seki, a designation of nationality that did not actually grant them citizenship. Roughly half of these people later received South Korean citizenship. The other half were affiliated with North Korea, which is unrecognized by Japan, and they are legally stateless. Practically speaking, they mostly hold North Korean citizenship (albeit meaningless in Japan, their country of residence) and may repatriate there, and under Japanese law, they are treated as foreign nationals and given the full privileges entitled to that class. In 2010, Chōsen-seki holders were banned from South Korea.

UNHCR published a study on statelessness in Japan in 2010.

=== Kuwait ===

Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region. Most stateless Bedoon of Kuwait belong to the northern tribes, especially the Al-Muntafiq tribal confederation. A minority of stateless Bedoon in Kuwait belong to the &#x27;Ajam community. 

Under the terms of the Kuwait Nationality Law 15/1959, all the Bedoon in Kuwait are eligible for Kuwaiti nationality by naturalization. In practice, it is widely believed that Sunnis of Persian descent or tribal Saudis can readily achieve Kuwaiti naturalization whilst Bedoon of Iraqi tribal ancestry cannot. As a result, many Bedoon in Kuwait feel pressured to hide their background. 

From 1965 until 1985, the Bedoon were treated as Kuwaiti citizens and guaranteed citizenship: they had free access to education, health care and all the other privileges of citizenship. The stateless Bedoon constituted 80-90% of the Kuwaiti Army in the 1970s and 1980s until the Gulf War.

In 1985 at the height of the Iran–Iraq War, the Bedoon were reclassified as &quot;illegal residents&quot; and denied Kuwaiti citizenship and its accompanying privileges. The Iran–Iraq War threatened Kuwait&#x27;s internal stability and the authorities feared the sectarian background of the stateless Bedoon. The Bedoon issue in Kuwait &quot;overlaps with historic sensitivities about Iraqi influence inside Kuwait&quot;, with many of those denied Kuwaiti nationality being believed to have originated from Iraq.

In 1985, the then emir, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, escaped an assassination attempt. After the assassination attempt, the government changed the Bedoon&#x27;s status from that of legal residents to illegal residents. By 1986, the Bedoon were fully excluded from the same social and economic rights as Kuwaiti citizens. 

Since 1986, the Kuwaiti government has refused to grant any form of documentation to the Bedoon, including birth certificates, death certificates, identity cards, marriage certificates, and driving licences. The Bedoon also face many restrictions in employment, travel and education. They are not permitted to educate their children in state schools and universities. 

In 1995, Human Rights Watch reported that there were 300,000 stateless Bedoon, and this number was formally repeated by the British government. 

According to several human rights organizations, the State of Kuwait is committing ethnic cleansing and genocide against the stateless Bedoon. The Kuwaiti Bedoon crisis resembles the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. In 1995, it was reported in the British parliament that the Al Sabah ruling family had deported 150,000 stateless Bedoon to refugee camps in the Kuwaiti desert near the Iraqi border with minimal water, insufficient food and no basic shelter, and that they were threatened with death if they returned to their homes in Kuwait City. As a result, many of the stateless Bedoon fled to Iraq, where they remain stateless people even today. The Kuwaiti government also stands accused of attempting to falsify their nationalities in official state documents. There have been reports of forced disappearances and mass graves of Bedoon.

The 1995 Human Rights Watch report stated:

&quot;The totality of the treatment of the Bedoons amounts to a policy of denationalization of native residents, relegating them to an apartheid-like existence in their own country. The Kuwaiti government policy of harassment and intimidation of the Bedoons and of denying them the right to lawful residence, employment, travel and movement, contravene basic principles of human rights. Denial of citizenship to the Bedoons clearly violates international law. Denying Bedoons the right to petition the courts to challenge governmental decisions regarding their claims to citizenship and lawful residence in the country violates the universal right to due process of law and equality before the law.&quot; 

British MP George Galloway stated:

&quot;Of all the human rights atrocities committed by the ruling family in Kuwait, the worst and the greatest is that against the people known as the Bedoons. There are more than 300,000 Bedoons—one third of Kuwait&#x27;s native population. Half of them—150,000—have been driven into refugee camps in the desert across the Iraqi border by the regime and left there to bake and to rot. The other 150,000 are treated not as second-class or even fifth-class citizens, but not as any sort of citizen. They are bereft of all rights. It is a scandal that almost no one in the world cares a thing about the plight of 300,000 people, 150,000 of them cast out of the land in which they have lived [when] many have lived in the Kuwaiti area for many centuries.&quot; 

By 2004, the Bedoon accounted for only 40% of the Kuwaiti Army, a major reduction from their presence in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2013, the UK government estimated that there were 110,729 &quot;documented&quot; Bedoon in Kuwait, without giving a total estimate, but noting that all stateless individuals in Kuwait remain at risk of persecution and human rights breaches. The Bedoon are generally categorized into three groups: stateless tribespeople, stateless police/military and the stateless children of Kuwaiti women who married Bedoon men. According to the Kuwaiti government, there are only 93,000 &quot;documented&quot; Bedoon in Kuwait. In 2018, the Kuwaiti government claimed that it would naturalize up to 4,000 stateless Bedoon per year but this is considered unlikely. 

In recent years, the rate of suicide among Bedoon has risen sharply.

=== Myanmar ===

The Rohingya people are a minority group in Myanmar (formerly Burma). They are considered racially inferior by the Myanmar government, and are thus denied citizenship from birth. Instead, they are given identification cards which single them out and which do not grant them the rights of citizenship. This has created some 700,000 stateless persons, been a basis for the Rohingya genocide, and precipitated an international refugee crisis.

=== Pakistan ===
Inside Karachi city there is a stateless population of approximately 1.2 million Pakistani Bengalis.

As of January 2022, there were approximately 3 million Afghans living in Pakistan, around 1.4 million of them are Proof of Registration (PoR) cardholders, approximately 840 000 hold an Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), and an estimated 775 000 are undocumented.

=== Palestinians ===
Abbas Shiblak estimates that over half of the Palestinian people in the world are stateless.

Palestinians in Lebanon and those in Syria are constitutionally denied citizenship, and are thus stateless.

After Israel annexed East Jerusalem following the Six-Day War in 1967, Palestinians living there received, along with Israeli permanent residency status, the right to apply for citizenship. Shortly after the offer was made, it was rejected by Arab leaders. Between 1967 and 2007, only 12,000 of the 250,000 Palestinians living in Jerusalem have been granted Israeli citizenship. Since 2007, more have applied, although the majority still reject it. Those who do not have Israeli citizenship are generally stateless.

Many descendants of Palestinian refugees live permanently in countries of which they would be expected to be citizens, but they are not citizens because that country adheres to the policy of the Arab League in denying citizenship to Palestinians.

Even though Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were issued Palestinian passports under the Oslo Accords and Palestinian legal statehood is somewhat widely acknowledged internationally as of 2018, some countries (such as the United States), recognize them as travel documents but do not recognize their citizenship. According to international law, only states can have nationals (meaning citizens), meaning that the remainder states who do not consider Palestine a state implements such policies and deem its holders as “stateless”.

A similar situation exists for Armenians in Israel and Palestine, where , about 2,000 Armenians in Israeli-controlled territory were stateless.

=== Philippines ===
As of 2021, there are around 700 people of Japanese descent who are considered as stateless. Most of these people are descendants of Japanese fathers who settled in the Philippines in the early 20th century. Due to the outbreak of the World War II, many of these individuals separated from their fathers who either enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army, repatriated to Japan or died during the war. After the war many of them settled in more remote areas of the Philippines and discarded proof of the Japanese nationality as a preventive measure against anti-Japanese retaliatory attacks due to atrocities committed by Japan during the war.

=== Puerto Rico ===

In 1994, Juan Mari Brás, a Puerto Rican lawyer and political historian, renounced his American citizenship before a consular agent in the United States Embassy of Venezuela. In December 1995, his loss of nationality was confirmed by the US Department of State. That same month, he requested that the Puerto Rico State Department furnish him with proof of his Puerto Rican citizenship. The request involved more than just a bureaucratic formality; Mari Brás tested the self-determination of Puerto Rico by trying to become the first Puerto Rican citizen who was not also an American citizen.

Mari Brás claimed that as a Puerto Rican national born and raised in Puerto Rico, he was clearly a Puerto Rican citizen and therefore had every right to continue to reside, work, and, most importantly, vote in Puerto Rico. The State Department responded promptly, claiming that Puerto Rican citizenship did not exist independent of American citizenship, and in 1998, the department rescinded its recognition of his renunciation of citizenship. The official response to Mari Brás stated that Puerto Rican citizenship existed only as an equivalent to residency. However, the Puerto Rico State Department issues certificates of citizenship to people born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican parent, including some people who may have never resided in the territory.

=== Qatar ===
Most of Qatar&#x27;s Bedoon are stateless tribesmen from the Ghufrani tribe. In 2005, Qatar stripped the citizenship of over 5,000 members of the tribe. After international outcry, it restored the citizenship of approximately 2,000. Today, there are between 1,200 and 1,500 Bedoon in Qatar.

===Saudi Arabia===
Dissidents and other people can have their citizenship revoked. Osama bin Laden was asked to hand in his passport in the 1990s.
=== Syria ===
By 2011, close to an estimated 300,000 stateless Kurds were in Syria. While the government&#x27;s implementation of the 2011 Decree did reduce the number of stateless persons, a significant part of Syria&#x27;s remaining statelessness problem has now been &#x27;exported&#x27; to new geographic and legal contexts with the displacement of affected persons out of the country.

=== Turkey ===

Following a failed coup in 2016, the Turkish government revoked about 50,000 passports. While most of the people whose passports were revoked were in Turkey at the time, one notable Turkish expatriate affected by this action was NBA player Enes Kanter. He is a vocal critic of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a public supporter of the Gülen movement, which the government blamed for the coup attempt. Kanter&#x27;s passport was canceled while he was attempting to travel to the U.S., and he was briefly detained in Romania before being allowed to continue his travel. Turkey issued an arrest warrant against Kanter in May 2017, claiming that he was a member of &quot;an armed terrorist organization.&quot; The government&#x27;s action effectively rendered Kanter stateless, and soon after this incident expressed a desire to seek U.S. citizenship. He then held a U.S. green card, which technically enabled him to travel to and from Canada for games in Toronto. However, in the 2018–19 season, Kanter did not travel with his team to games in London or Toronto because Turkey had requested an Interpol red notice against him. On November 29, 2021, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, changing his name to Enes Kanter Freedom.

=== Ukraine ===
After the completion of his term, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili moved to Ukraine where he was given citizenship and appointed Governor of Ukraine&#x27;s Odesa Oblast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Georgian restrictions on dual nationality, he was stripped of his Georgian citizenship.

While visiting the U.S. in 2017, Saakashvili&#x27;s Ukrainian citizenship was revoked by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, leaving Saakashvili stateless. After the election of Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, Saakashvili&#x27;s Ukrainian citizenship was restored.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In the United Arab Emirates some stateless people were granted citizenship after many years and even decades. Children of a foreign parent were also granted citizenship.

=== United Kingdom ===
Different classes in British nationality law have led to situations in which people were considered British subjects but not nationals, or in which people held a British passport without right of abode in the United Kingdom. Examples include British Protected Persons, who are considered British nationals. British nationals (irrespective of the class of nationality) who reside abroad but are not entitled to protection by the British government are &quot;de facto&quot; stateless.

Many situations that put people at risk of statelessness were resolved after April 30, 2003, when the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act of 2002 came into force. As a result of this act, the United Kingdom gave most people with residual British nationality but no other citizenship the right to register as full British citizens. However, there are still some people who have not been able or willing to register as citizens. Following the publication of a joint UNHCR-Asylum Aid report in 2011, the UK adopted a statelessness determination procedure in 2013.
In January 2014, the Immigration Bill 2013–14 was introduced to extend the powers of the Home Secretary to deprive a naturalised British citizen of their citizenship, even if that renders the individual stateless, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the deprivation of citizenship is conducive to the public good because the person &quot;has conducted him or herself in a manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK.&quot; A naturalised British citizen is someone who was not born a British citizen but has become one through the legal process of naturalisation, by which someone with no automatic claim to British citizenship can obtain the same rights and privileges as someone who was born a British citizen. The bill was initially blocked by the House of Lords in April 2014. However, the Lords reconsidered their decision in May 2014, and the bill returned to the House of Commons before being set into UK law.

=== United States ===

The United States, which is not a signatory to the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, is one of the countries that allow their citizens to renounce their citizenship even if they do not hold any other. The &quot;Foreign Affairs Manual&quot; instructs State Department employees to make it clear to Americans who will become stateless after renunciation that they may face extreme difficulties (including deportation back to the United States) following their renunciation, but to afford such persons their right to give up citizenship. Former Americans who have voluntarily made themselves stateless include Garry Davis in the beginning years of the United Nations, Thomas Jolley during the Vietnam War, Joel Slater as a political protest in 1987 while believing that he would obtain Australian citizenship, and Mike Gogulski as a political protest in 2008 without attempting to take any other citizenship. The UNHCR published a report on statelessness in the United States in 2012 in which it recommended the establishment of a determination procedure that incorporates a definition of statelessness in accordance with international law to ensure that stateless persons are permitted to reside in the United States.

The Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution granted citizenship to African American slaves. The Supreme Court ruling in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; clarified that people born to aliens on US soil were entitled to citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, it excluded Native Americans by defining a citizen as any person born in the US, but only if &quot;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot;; this latter clause excluded anyone who was born in tribal nations within the United States, as the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot; that they are &quot;quasi-foreign nations who deal with Congress using treaties&quot;. The Indian Citizenship Act addressed the issue by granting citizenship to America&#x27;s indigenous peoples.

=== Uruguay ===

Uruguay has ratified both the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and implemented law 19682 to meet these ratified commitments. It is also a signatory of the &quot;Brazil Declaration&quot; which commits countries in the South American region to end statelessness by January 1, 2024. 

However the 1968 law provides for Uruguayan citizenship as one of the mechanisms to end statelessness. While the process of naturalization to citizenship is similar to other ius domicilii regimes, it does not lead to Uruguayan nationality. As a result, stateless residents will become stateless citizens, and also citizens of countries that do not allow for dual citizenship also become stateless citizens of Uruguay. Uruguayan passports issued to this group of citizens highlights their status through &quot;XXX&quot; in the national field, meaning &quot;unknown nationality&quot;.

== Organizations ==
=== United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ===
==== Statelessness mandate ====
UNHCR&#x27;s responsibilities were initially limited to stateless persons who were refugees, as set out in Paragraph 6(A)(II) of its statute and Article 1(A)(2) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. They were expanded following the adoption of the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. General Assembly Resolutions 3274 (XXIV) and 31/36 designated UNHCR as the body responsible for examining the cases of persons who claimed the benefit of the 1961 convention and assisting such persons in presenting their claims to the appropriate national authorities. Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly conferred upon UNHCR a global mandate for the identification, prevention, and reduction of statelessness and for the international protection of stateless persons. This mandate has continued to evolve as the General Assembly has endorsed the conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee, notably Executive Committee Conclusion No. 106 of 2006 on the &quot;identification, prevention, and reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons&quot;.

==== Global campaign to end statelessness ====
The UNHCR launched a global campaign on November 4, 2014, to end statelessness within 10 years.

As part of the campaign, it published a special report providing a comprehensive overview of statelessness and delving into the human impact of the phenomenon. It also published an open letter addressed to states, urging them to take action. In addition to UNHCR High Commissioner António Guterres, the letter was signed by Angelina Jolie, a UNHCR special envoy; Surin Pitsuwan, former secretary-general of ASEAN; Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate; Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu; Barbara Hendricks, a UNHCR honorary lifetime goodwill ambassador; Madeleine Albright, former US secretary of state; Carla Del Ponte, former chief prosecutor of two UN international criminal tribunals; Zeid Ra&#x27;ad Al Hussein and Louise Arbour, former UN high commissioners for human rights; and Dame Rosalyn Higgins, former president of the International Court of Justice, among others.

In addition, a &quot;global action plan to end statelessness&quot; was launched following consultation with states, civil society, and international organisations. It sets out a guiding framework of 10 actions that need to be taken to end statelessness by 2024.

The plan includes actions to:
* resolve existing situations of statelessness;
* prevent new cases of statelessness from emerging; and
* better identify and protect stateless persons.

The 10 actions are:
* Action 1: Resolve existing major situations of statelessness.
* Action 2: Ensure that no child is born stateless.
* Action 3: Remove gender discrimination from nationality laws.
* Action 4: Prevent denial, loss, or deprivation of nationality on discriminatory grounds.
* Action 5: Prevent statelessness in cases of state succession.
* Action 6: Grant protection status to stateless migrants and facilitate their naturalisation.
* Action 7: Ensure birth registration for the prevention of statelessness.
* Action 8: Issue nationality documentation to those entitled to it.
* Action 9: Accede to the UN statelessness conventions.
* Action 10: Improve quantitative and qualitative data on stateless populations.

=== International Stateless Persons Organisation ===
In March 2012, the International Stateless Persons Organisation (ISPO), an international non-governmental organization, was founded by Dr. Fernando Macolor Cruz, a tribal prince and instructor of history and political science at Palawan State University in the Philippines. It aims to provide institutional representation to stateless persons throughout the world through a network of volunteer human rights law practitioners who act as country representatives.

=== Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion ===
The Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion is an independent non-profit organisation dedicated to leading an integrated, interdisciplinary response to statelessness. It works on research, analysis, empowerment, advocacy, and awareness globally. It also maintains an online forum on statelessness.

=== European Network on Statelessness ===
The European Network on Statelessness, a civil society alliance, was set up to address the problem of 600,000 stateless persons in Europe and to act as a coordinating body and expert resource for organisations across Europe that work with or come into contact with stateless persons.

<text>Dudgeonea is a small genus of moths and the only genus of its family, the Dudgeoneidae. It includes six species distributed sparsely across the Old World from Africa and Madagascar to Australia and New Guinea.

==Biology==
The genus is poorly studied, but the Australian species, &quot;Dudgeonea actinias&quot;, tunnels in trunks of &quot;Canthium attenuatum&quot; (Rubiaceae) and the pupa is extruded like many other internal feeders.

<text>Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten (6 November 1817, in Stralsund – 10 July 1908, in Zoppot) was a German botanist and geologist.

== Biography ==
Born in Stralsund, he followed the example of Alexander von Humboldt and traveled 1844-56 the northern part of South America (Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia). From 1856 to 1868, he was a professor at the agricultural college in Berlin, afterwards serving as a professor of plant physiology at the University of Vienna (1868–72). In 1881, at the suggestion of David Friedrich Weinland, Karsten became convinced of the correctness of Otto Hahn&#x27;s organic theory of the chondrites and, as a result, wrote an essay entitled &quot;Die Meteorite und ihre Organismen&quot; in which he declared his support for Hahn&#x27;s theory. He died 1908 in Berlin-Grunewald.

As a taxonomist, he was the binomial author of many botanical species.

<text>Charles Ezra Sprague (October 9, 1842 – March 21, 1912) was an American accountant, born in Nassau, Rensselaer County, New York. He was a proponent of the constructed language Volapük, for which he authored the first major textbook in English, &quot;&quot; (1888), as well as an early organizer of the accounting profession.

During the American Civil War, Sprague served in the 44th New York Infantry, seeing action at the Battle of Gettysburg, where his unit was instrumental in helping repulse attacks on Little Round Top. The New York State Archives stores a lengthy article Sprague wrote on his military service.

He was president of both the New York Institute of Accounts and the Union Dime Savings Bank (which later became the Dime Savings Bank). Later in life, he was involved in the movement for reform of English spelling as part of the Simplified Spelling Board, of which he was the first treasurer.

He was heavily involved in the development of the first state certification of accountants in the United States.

In 1953 he was inducted into Ohio State University&#x27;s Accounting Hall of Fame.

Sprague was the maternal grandfather of science fiction author L. Sprague de Camp.

<text>; born 6 January 1975 is a Japanese hip-hop rapper. He first appeared on the Japanese hip-hop scene in the 1990s, collaborating in a Shakkazombie song, &quot;Tomo ni ikkou&quot;. Since 2002, he has released three albums: &quot;Hitman&quot; (2002), &quot;Diamond&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Force&quot; (2006). Dabo&#x27;s lyrics are more hard-edged than most J-pop, or Japanese pop, and represent a tough Japanese street culture. He also appears as a playable character in the Japanese version of &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot;.

==Music career==
He became a member of &quot;Nitro Microphone Underground&quot; in 1997. In 1999 he released his first single, &quot;Mr. Fudatzkee&quot;. In 2001, he was the first Japanese artist to be signed by Def Jam Japan. That same year, he made his major debut as a solo artist releasing &quot;Platinum Tongue,&quot; which reached number fifteen on the Japanese (Oricon) music charts. In addition to his solo works, Dabo racked up numerous credits collaborating with various artists. In addition to his solo works, he has amassed more than 60 credits working with various artists.

<text>A subcontractor is a person or business which undertakes to perform part or all of the obligations of another&#x27;s contract, and a subcontract is a contract which assigns part of an existing contract to a subcontractor.

A general contractor, prime contractor or main contractor may hire subcontractors to perform specific tasks as part of an overall project to reduce costs or to mitigate project risks. In employing subcontractors, the general contractor hopes to receive the same or better service than the general contractor could have provided by itself, at lower overall risk.

The European Union has recognised the need to make provision for sub-contracting in its rules on public procurement, as arrangements for sub-contracting can support the EU&#x27;s drive to involve more small and medium-sized undertakings in the provision of goods and services for the public sector.

==Definition==
United States public acquisition regulations contain a number of distinct definitions of &quot;subcontract&quot; and &quot;subcontractor&quot;, with calls for a consolidated definition to be adopted.

==Types==
In United Kingdom building industry contract law, particularly when using JCT standard form contracts, three subcontractor types are identified:
; Domestic subcontractor: A subcontractor who contracts with the main contractor to supply or fix any materials or goods or execute work forming part of the main contract. Essentially this contractor is employed by the main contractor.
; Nominated subcontractor: Certain contracts permit the architect or supervising officer to reserve the right of the final selection and approval of subcontractors. The main contractor is permitted to make a profit from the use of nominated subcontractors on site, but must provide &quot;attendance&quot; (usually the provision of water, power, restrooms, and other services to enable the nominated subcontractor to do his job). In effect the appointment of nominated subcontractors establishes a direct contractual relationship between the client and the subcontractor.
; Named subcontractors: Effectively the same as a domestic subcontractor — a subcontractor who contracts with the main contractor to supply or fix any materials or goods or execute work forming part of the main contract. Essentially this contractor is employed by the main contractor.

==Contracting law==
An obligation to award a subcontract to a named subcontractor can arise, where a bidding process names a subcontractor as an intended partner and a prime contract is subsequently awarded to the contractor by the client. In a 2002 Canadian case, &quot;A. Dynasty Roofing (Windsor) Ltd. v. Marathon Construction Services (1991) Inc.&quot;, the Ontario Superior Court held that when Marathon Construction Services, a general contractor in the construction industry, had bid for a contract to construct an industrial building in January 1999, it had named Dynasty and another roofing company, Smith Peat, as the subcontractors who would be employed for the roofing work. Prices had been submitted by both Dynasty and Smith Peat, both were held to be capable of doing the work, and Dynasty&#x27;s prices were the lowest submitted. However, on being awarded the prime contract, Marathon agreed a lower price with Smith Peat and offered them the subcontract. The court held that Marathon were obliged to subcontract with Dynasty, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the ruling in October 2003.

==Tax law==
Under UK tax law, certain activities that might appear to be subcontracting are actually treated differently. This is a subtlety of corporate taxation that may easily be missed or misunderstood, and may be relevant to research and development tax relief. Examples of activities that involve outsourced work that do not count as subcontracting for tax purposes include:
* Collaborative research – research carried out across two companies that benefits both companies.
* Externally provided workers 
* Self-employed consultants.

==Payment clauses==
Some contractors appoint subcontractors to work under a &quot;pay when paid&quot; clause, sometimes called a &quot;pay if paid&quot; clause, where the general contractor will work with subcontractors and the subcontractors are only paid if and when the general contractor is paid for the work. An example clause from a construction context reads:

However, in the case of Avon Brothers, Inc. v. Tom Martin Construction Company, Inc., the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division ruled in 2000 that a &quot;pay when paid&quot; clause represents an unconditional promise to pay, merely permitting payment to be postponed for a reasonable time, and not a condition precedent which would completely excuse the contractor&#x27;s obligation to pay even though not paid themselves. Under Florida construction law, a pay when paid clause is unenforceable unless it unambiguously transfers the risk of non-payment to the subcontractor. The common usage and generally shared intent of pay-when-paid clauses in the Florida construction industry was recognised by the Florida Supreme Court in &quot;Peacock Construction Co. v Modern Air Conditioning, Inc.&quot;, 353 so 2d 840 (Florida 1977), even though the contractual language used may vary from case to case.

<text>Iranian Assemblies of God Church () is the Iranian branch of the Assemblies of God, one of the largest evangelical Pentecostal Christian churches. It has its centre in Tehran, Iran.

Many (about 80%) of its adherents are converts from Islam, the remainder are converts from Iranian Christian ethnic minorities. The services are conducted in Persian and Armenian.

== Controversy ==
In the mid-1990s, Bishop Haik Hovsepian Mehr, head of the Iranian Assemblies of God, was ordered to comply with the following directives:
* No church service must be conducted in Persian language (the language of the people)
* All members must be issued with membership cards and their admittance to the services would be on production of the appropriate card.
* Photocopies of these cards and appropriate membership lists with their addresses to be given to the competent authorities.
* Sunday meetings were to be for members only. No meetings to be held on any other day, in particular Friday.
* No new members may be admitted without informing the appropriate department of the Ministry of Information and Islamic Guidance.

===Reaction===
The late bishop stated that &quot;Never would he or his ministers bow down and comply with such inhumane and unjust demands&quot; and that &quot;our churches are open to all who want to come in.&quot;

Several churches have been forced to close by the Iranian regime. These include a building in Kerman and another in Ahwaz, both used by the Anglican and Presbyterian congregations in those cities; and the Assemblies of God Church in Gorgan. (This was the only evangelical church in the whole of Mazanderan province, and with its closure, there is nowhere for evangelical Christians to worship.) Various church house-groups have also been closed down in Sari and Mashad and Ahwaz and the Christians there are strictly forbidden to meet.

Despite guarantees of religious freedom for Christians in Article 13 of the Iranian constitution, it remains an offence to sell a copy of the Bible in Iran, which is practically impossible anyway, since the offices of the Iranian Bible Society were closed in 1980 and all its stocks confiscated by the State authorities. Despite all denials at the official level the Law on Apostasy is practised and remains in force. It is under this law that converts from Islam to other religions are subject to capital punishment.

In 1989, the Rev. Hossein Soodmand was executed for apostasy. Although born a Muslim, by 1989 Hossein had been a Christian for 25 years. He was an evangelist and the pastor of the Assemblies of God (AOG) Church in Mashad. Despite pleas for clemency by fellow pastors to the Dayro-E-Tasalamat (an Ombudsman and Muslim cleric-literally, &quot;he who hears the cries of the oppressed&quot;), Hossein was hanged on 3 December 1989 at the insistence of the Ombudsman. He left a blind wife and four children.

Mehdi Dibaj, a Muslim convert to Christianity, was imprisoned for nearly 9 years. During that time, he endured 2 years in solitary confinement and was subjected to mock executions. He was imprisoned by the Sharia court in Sari on three charges: that he had &quot;insulted Islam, the prophet Muhammad and Ayatollah Khomeini&quot; in a letter; that he was acting as a spy for the West; and that he was an apostate.

Iran&#x27;s Supreme Court on two occasions dismissed the first charge on grounds that the letter was not proved to be in Hossein&#x27;s handwriting and the second charge as unfounded. He continued to remain in prison solely on grounds of apostasy. In 1994, he was sentenced to death for apostasy and only after an international campaign for his release was he allowed out of prison on January 16 of that year.

Dibaj was abducted on Friday, June 24, 1994. His body was found in a west Tehran park on Tuesday, July 5, 1994.

<doc id="789835" wikidata="Q5775700" url="?curid=789835" title="History of Cieszyn">
<text>Cieszyn is one of the oldest towns in Silesia and has a history that has been traced back to at least the 7th century.

== History ==

===Early history===
Cieszyn, one of the oldest towns in Silesia, has had a Slav population (Golensizi tribe) since at least the 7th century. According to a modern legend, in 810 three sons of a Slav king – Bolko, Leszko and Cieszko, met here after a long pilgrimage, found a spring, and in their happiness decided to found a new settlement. They supposedly called it &quot;Cieszyn&quot; (cf. the verb for &quot;to be happy&quot;; , ). This well stands in the ulica Trzech Braci (Three Brothers Street), just west of the town square. A more scientific explanation for the name is that it&#x27;s patronymic in origin, derived from the Slavic name *&quot;Ciecha&quot; or *&quot;Ciesza&quot;. The town centres on Castle Hill (Góra Zamkowa), where the oldest traces of settlement date back to the 6th or 7th centuries. The &quot;gród&quot; built on the hill gradually gained importance and became an important administrative and religious center, as a castle and a Romanesque chapel were erected within its stakes in the 11th century, the latter surviving to this day (and is depicted on reverse of the 20 złotych note).

===Piast rule===
The area became part of the emerging Polish state under the Piast dynasty in the 10th century. The first written reference to Cieszyn came in a document from Pope Adrian IV for the Wrocław bishop Valter from 23 April 1155. It concerned the castle of &quot;Tessin&quot;, which was listed among other centres of castellanies, however it was no earlier than 1223 that it was explicitly described as castellany (&quot;castellatura de Tessin&quot;). Around the castle a town grew up on a fortified headland above the Olza River with the center around what is nowadays &quot;Plac Teatralny&quot; (&quot;Theater Square&quot;), where the very first parish church was built before the end of the 12th century. The document from 1223 issued by Bishop of Wrocław also mentioned the suburbium, which suggest that Cieszyn already had city rights. The city rights are documented in 1290, and later confirmed in 1374. Around 1240 a new parish church was also built in the vicinity of the first market square (nowadays &quot;Stary Targ&quot; - &quot;Old Market&quot;).

The town shared the history of Silesia, and after the feudal division of Poland, Piast dukes of the Silesian line ruled the area. Cieszyn became a seat of the Duchy of Cieszyn. In 1327 Kazimierz I swore homage to the Bohemian and titular Polish king John of Luxembourg. Since then, Cieszyn became an autonomic fiefdom of the Bohemian crown. As a capital city of the Duchy, Cieszyn developed quickly and increased its significance. It also became a religious center of the duchy, after creation of a deaconry in the early 14th century. The largest development occurred during the rule of Przemysław I Noszak, who gained the city rights for Cieszyn in 1374 and reconstructed the wooden castle into the bricked one. It was back then when the mayor and city council appeared, in 1387 first known mayor being Mikołaj Giseler. Town hall for the city council has been built.

Another rapid development of the town occurred during the rule of Casimir II, who invested in infrastructure of the town and erected defense walls around Cieszyn. Casimir II also founded a new market square and donated buildings for a new city council which serve the city to this day. In the 16th century the town became an important centre of trade and commerce, with significant manufacture of arms and jewelry. It also became a centre of the Reformation. The town gradually developed until the 17th century, when it was heavily damaged during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. As a result of the war, economic and demographic decline followed in the whole Duchy.
The rule of the Cieszyn Piast dynasty continued to 1653, ending with the death of the last Duchess Elizabeth Lucretia. Thereupon the duchy lapsed directly to the Kings of Bohemia, at that time Ferdinand IV of Habsburg. The Habsburg takeover of the duchy caused economic and political stagnation of Cieszyn until the end of the century.

=== Cieszyn under Habsburg rule ===
The end of the era of Counter-Reformation allowed the construction of a large Lutheran church in Cieszyn in 1709–1750. The role of Teschen strengthened after the end of the Silesian Wars in the 18th century. As a result of the wars, Cieszyn Silesia remained part of Austria. On 13 May 1779 the Peace of Teschen ending the War of Bavarian Succession has been signed in the town by Austria and Prussia. In 1772 Cieszyn also served as the main seat of the Bar Confederation. Development of the town has been halted by the great fire of 1789, which damaged nearly the whole town. Since late 18th century German culture began to dominate in the town.
In the 19th century Cieszyn underwent rapid cultural and educational development. In 1802 the priest Leopold Szersznik created a museum which later became a Museum of Cieszyn Silesia, one of the first public museums in Polish lands. In 1839 the Piast castle has been finally dismantled, and a new Classicist castle erected in its place. In 1836 another fire affected Cieszyn and destroyed part of the central city, including the town hall, which was restored in 1846 and remains in this form since then. In the same year a brewery was built near Castle Hill. During the Spring of Nations of 1848, Cieszyn became an important centre of the Polish national thought. In the same year, the first Polish and the first at all newspaper in the duchy, the &quot;Tygodnik Cieszyński&quot; appeared.

After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The town became a seat of political and legal district.

In 1869 the railway line reached Cieszyn and a rail station was constructed at the left bank of the Olza River (current Český Těšín). Construction of the rail station caused a quick development of the left bank of the town, which served as the industrial portion of the town. The industrial development was overshadowed by the more industrial neighbouring town of Bielsko. Teschen however remained an important administrative and cultural centre.

At the end of the 19th century the population of the town consisted mostly of Germans and Poles, with Germans being the majority in the town and Poles being the majority in the whole duchy. There were also significant Jewish and Czech minorities and occasionally a visible Hungarian minority.
According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the town grew from 13,004 in 1880 to 22,489 in 1910 with a growing majority being native German-speakers (from 49.5% in 1880 to 61.5% in 1910) accompanied by a Polish-speaking minority (at most 42.7% in 1890, then dropping to 31.7% in 1910), Czech-speaking (at most 13.9% in 1880, later between 4.2% in 1890 and 6.7% in 1910) and at most 69 people speaking another languages in 1900. In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (67.3%), followed by Protestants (23%), Jews (9.4%) and additional 65 people who were adherents to another faiths. Traditionally the town and especially its surroundings were inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. The growth of German language, then prestigious language of the state, can be partially attributed to various reasons, including cultural cringe of indigenous Slavic denizens. The results of those censuses and factors shaping national identity of the local population became a perennial subject of the political squabbles in the region.

In 1911 a tramway line was built; it crossed the Olza River and connected the rail station on the left bank with the town centre on the right bank. During World War I, Austrian troops were stationed in the town, and the General Staff of the Austrian army established itself there for some time.

===Interbellum===

Historian Piotr Stefan Wandycz argues that:
The dispute over Teschen during the Paris Peace Conference is crucial for understanding Czechoslovak-Polish relations in 1919 and in the following years. It also brings out clearly the French attitude toward both Czechoslovakia and Poland.

The region was rich in coal and rail connections and was eagerly sought by both Poland and Czechoslovakia. At the end of World War I local Poles and Czechs each established their own self-governing organs. Both groups claimed that the whole of Cieszyn Silesia rightfully belonged to their new nation. To ease the friction which developed, the local self-governments concluded an interim agreement on 5 November 1918 concerning the division of the area based on ethnic composition. However, by 1919 metropolitan governments in Prague and Warsaw superseded the local administrations, with the Czechs arguing that the division was unfair. In particular, the crucial railway going to east Slovakia (Košice-Bohumín Railway) went through the region and access to the railway was vital: newly formed Czechoslovakia was at war with the Hungarian Soviet Republic over control over Slovakia. This set the stage for conflict.

Despite the division being interim only, Poland decided to organise elections to the Polish parliament (Sejm) in the area. Czechoslovakia claimed that no sovereign rule could establish itself in the disputed area before determination of a definitive solution, and requested that the polls not take place in the area. Poland rejected the Czechoslovak request and Czechoslovakia attacked the Polish part of the region on 23 January 1919 and forced Poland, which was at that time in war also with the West Ukrainian National Republic over eastern Galicia, to withdraw from the western part of Cieszyn Silesia. After the fight near Skoczów a cease-fire was reached, signed in Paris on 3 February 1919. Poland had to recognize new borders running along the Olza River in 1920. Czechoslovakia received the western section (including the Karviná coal basin and the railway line) and smaller western part of the town, known later as Český Těšín, while Poland received the eastern section with Cieszyn and its historical centre.

During interwar period two villages were merged with Cieszyn: Błogocice (in 1923) and Bobrek (in 1932).

Since then, Poland occasionally claimed the Czech section, eventually annexing it in October 1938 after the Munich Agreement.

===World War II===

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the entire town was occupied by Germany until 1945. In 1939–1940, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles during the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; campaign, and then imprisoned them in a newly established Nazi prison in the town. Many Polish teachers, school principals, priests and activists were deported to concentration camps and murdered there. The Nazi prison had two forced labour subcamps in the town, and two more in nearby Karviná and Konská. The Germans also established a camp for children up to the age of 2-3, where they were beaten, tortured and subjected to medical experiments. In 1941, the occupiers established the Stalag VIII-D prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, French, Belgian, British and Serbian POWs, which in September 1942 was converted into a subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B camp. The Germans also operated the E386 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 POW camp in the present-day district of Krasna.

The 1920 borders were restored after the war in 1945.

===Post-war period===
After World War II, both cities were expanded by joining adjacent villages. Svibice (1947), Dolní Žukov (1960), Horní Žukov, Mistřovice (together with Mosty and Koňákov) and Stanislavice (1975) were amalgamated with Český Těšín, whereas in 1973 Boguszowice, Gułdowy, Kalembice, Krasna, Mnisztwo, Pastwiska and in 1977 Marklowice were amalgamated with Cieszyn.

<doc id="789838" wikidata="Q272617" url="?curid=789838" title="Anne Geddes">
<text>Anne Elizabeth Geddes (born 1956) is an Australian-born, New York City-based portrait photographer known primarily for her elaborately-staged photographs of infants.

Geddes&#x27;s books have been published in 83 countries. According to Amazon.com, she has sold more than 18 million books and 13 million calendars. In 1997, Cedco Publishing sold more than 1.8 million calendars and date books bearing Geddes&#x27; photography. Her 1996 debut book &quot;Down in the Garden&quot;, was featured on the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and made it to the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. Her books have been translated into 23 languages.

==Early life==
In her 2007 autobiography &quot;Labor of Love&quot;, Geddes talked about her difficult early years at their family cattle farm in Queensland, Australia. She dropped out of school at 17 and left home. Later, she met and married Kel Geddes, and moved to Hong Kong in 1983 for his work in television. There, at age 25, she taught herself photography using her husband&#x27;s 35mm Pentax K1000 camera. By the time the couple returned to Sydney two years later, she had built a small portfolio. She started specializing in baby photography after using photographs of her two daughters for a family Christmas card which proved popular.

==Career==
Geddes became a professional photographer at age 30 after she moved to Melbourne due to her husband&#x27;s work. She assisted a local photographer before starting her own studio from her garage.

Geddes also shoots for philanthropic causes. Geddes created her own philanthropic program, the Geddes Philanthropic Trust, whose primary focus was to raise awareness of child abuse and neglect. In 2013, she created a series for the survivors of meningococcal disease. The photographs depict families and children that have been affected by the disease and honours those who have survived. She shot photographs of 15 child survivors of meningitis for the &quot;Protecting Our Tomorrows: Portraits of Meningococcal Disease&quot; campaign. She has also worked with March of Dimes.

==Process==
Geddes does not audition babies for use as models because she believes all babies are beautiful. Instead, she keeps in touch with multiple birth and twin clubs and has thousands of photographs on file that parents have sent her. Geddes currently resides in New York with her husband Kel.

A typical sitting takes place in the morning when the babies are well-rested, and lasts about half an hour; otherwise, the babies could get too bored or fussy. &quot;You have to be really fast&quot;, Geddes says about getting good shots. She sets up her studio in advance – props, lighting, cameras, and equipment — so that all the baby or babies have to do is sit. Many of her props are custom made, such as oversized shoes and flowerpots. She keeps the babies&#x27; parents nearby for extra assistance with expressions.

==Honours and awards==
In the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Geddes was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to photography and the community.

In 2017 Geddes was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Popular culture==
In a skit on &quot;The Ronnie Johns Half Hour&quot;, Geddes (played by Felicity Ward) helps a Chinese family hide their additional children from one-child policy inspectors by camouflaging them in conspicuous places, which the inspectors are unable to notice.

&quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Internet Tendency&quot;, the humour site of McSweeney&#x27;s, published a Short Imagined Monologue called &quot;An Anne Geddes Baby Grows Up&quot;.

Humor website &quot;The Onion&quot; spoofed Geddes&#x27;s style with &quot;Anne Geddes Starting to Lose It&quot;.

In the eighth episode of the sixth season of &quot;Friends&quot;, entitled &quot;The One with Ross&#x27;s Teeth&quot;, Joey Tribbiani complains to his roommate Janine about a Geddes photograph she hung on the living room wall. The photograph depicted a baby Joey didn&#x27;t recognise dressed as a water lily. After being told that Anne Geddes is a famous artist, he assumes that the baby is Anne Geddes.

On the comedy website called Funny or Die, there was a humorous skit on the adulthood of the babies from her photos.

On the 26 June 2017 episode of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, Colbert shows a drawing of Sean Spicer and jokingly showed how Spicer would look as depicted by famous artists, including Geddes.

In the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;The Census of the Lambs&quot;, Klaus copies Geddes&#x27;s photographs in his own photoshoot and gets attacked by an angry version of Geddes.

In an episode of &quot;The Office&quot; Angela Martin and Andrew Bernard use Jan Levinson&#x27;s baby (Astrid) in a Geddes-style photo shoot, while the two of them are visiting Dunder Mifflin for Jan&#x27;s debauched baby shower. Jan finds them in the break room, and is enraged that they are photographing a baby using a flash, and that Astrid is on a table surrounded by vegetables and dressed in cabbage leaves. Geddes&#x27;s name is never mentioned directly, but her style of photography was heavily implied.

In &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, season six episode seven mentions character Moira Rose&#x27;s collaboration with Anne Geddes on a print advertisement for heartburn.

<doc id="789839" wikidata="Q7598363" url="?curid=789839" title="Standard of living in India">
<text>The standard of living in India varies from state to state. In 2021, extreme poverty was reduced to 0.8% and India is no longer the nation with the largest population living in poverty. 

There is significant income inequality within India, as it is simultaneously home to some of the world&#x27;s richest people. The average wages are estimated to quadruple between 2013-30.

The standard of living in India shows large geographical disparity as well. For example, on one hand most metropolitan cities and other urban and suburban regions boast world-class medical establishments, luxurious hotels, sports facilities and leisure activities similar to that of Western nations, while there is significant poverty in rural areas of India; where medical care tends to be very basic or unavailable due to a lack of doctors. Similarly, the very latest machinery may be used in most construction projects, but some construction staff work without mechanisation in some projects; predominantly in very rural parts. However, a rural middle class is now emerging in India, with some rural areas seeing increasing prosperity.

As per the IMF&#x27;s World Economic Outlook for 2020, the per capita PPP-adjusted GDP for India was estimated to be US$9,027.

== Poverty ==

24.3% of the population earned less than US$1 (PPP, around US$0.25 in nominal terms) a day in 2005, down from 42.1% in 1981. 41.6% of its population (540 million people approx.) is living below the new international poverty line of $1.25 (PPP) per day, down from 59.8% in 1981. India, in 2019 has about 2.7% population under poverty level and is no longer holding the largest population under poverty level, considering Nigeria and Congo. 
On the other hand, the Planning Commission of India uses its own criteria and has estimated that 27.5% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2004–2005, down from 51.3% in 1977–1978, and 36% in 1993–1994. The source for this was the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (NSS) and the criterion used was monthly per capita consumption expenditure below  356.35 for rural areas and  538.60 for urban areas. 75% of the poor are in rural areas, most of them are daily wagers, self-employed householders and landless labourers.

Although The Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, its growth has been uneven when comparing different social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas. For the year 2015–16, the GSDP growth rates of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh was higher than Maharashtra, Odisha or Punjab.

Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under planning, to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. Programmes like &quot;Food for work&quot; and &quot;National Rural Employment Programme&quot; have attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. In August 2005, the Indian parliament passed the &quot;Rural Employment Guarantee Bill&quot;, the largest programme of this type, in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of India&#x27;s 600 districts. The Indian government is planning to bring in more economic reforms which can help farmers and unskilled labourers transition into industrialised sectors.

== Physical infrastructure ==
Since independence, India has allocated nearly half of the total outlay of the five-year plans for infrastructural development. Much of the total outlay was spent on large projects in the area of irrigation, energy, transport, communications and social overheads. Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment.
Kolkata was the first city in India to boast of a metro-system. The government has partially opened up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment. India holds second position in the world in roadways&#x27; construction.

As of 2018, there were an estimated 18,170,000 broadband lines in India. The country boasts the second highest number of internet users at 446.75 million which translates to around 35% of the country&#x27;s population. 
A study by WaterAid estimated as many as 157 million Indians live without adequate sanitation. India comes top for having the greatest number of urbanites living without sanitation.

== Regional imbalance ==

One of the critical problems facing India&#x27;s economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India&#x27;s different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. For instance, the difference in growth rate between the forward and backward states was 0.3% (5.2% &amp; 4.9%) during 1980–81 to 1990–91, but had grown to 3.3% (6.3% &amp; 3.0%) during 1990–91 to 1997–98.

The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities. Even the industrial townships in the interiors, Bhilai for instance, resulted in very little development in the surrounding areas. After liberalisation, the disparities have grown despite the efforts of the union government in reducing them. Part of the reason being that manufacturing and services and not agriculture are the engines of growth. The more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.

<doc id="789862" wikidata="Q754348" url="?curid=789862" title="Infant respiratory distress syndrome">
<text>Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), also known as surfactant deficiency disorder(SDD), and previously called hyaline membrane disease (HMD), is a syndrome in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also be a consequence of neonatal infection and can result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant-associated proteins.

IRDS affects about 1% of newborns and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Data have shown the choice of elective caesarean sections to strikingly increase the incidence of respiratory distress in term infants; dating back to 1995, the UK first documented 2,000 annual caesarean section births requiring neonatal admission for respiratory distress. The incidence decreases with advancing gestational age, from about 50% in babies born at 26–28 weeks to about 25% at 30–31 weeks. The syndrome is more frequent in males, Caucasians, infants of diabetic mothers and the second-born of premature twins.

IRDS is distinct from pulmonary hypoplasia, another leading cause of neonatal death that involves respiratory distress.

The European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome highlight new possibilities for early detection, and therefore treatment of IRDS. The guidelines mention an easy to use rapid point-of-care predictive test that is now available and how lung ultrasound, with appropriate training, expertise and equipment, may offer an alternative way of diagnosing IRDS early.

== Signs and symptoms ==
IRDS begins shortly after birth and is manifested by fast breathing (more than 60 breaths per minute), a fast heart rate, chest wall retractions (recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and blue discoloration of the skin during breathing efforts.

As the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure (rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood) and prolonged cessations of breathing (&quot;apnea&quot;). Whether treated or not, the clinical course for the acute disease lasts about two to three days. During the first day, the child worsens and requires more support. During the second day, the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support and resolution is noted during the third day, heralded by a prompt diuresis. Despite huge advances in care, IRDS remains the most common single cause of death in the first month of life in the developed world. Complications include metabolic disorders (acidosis, low blood sugar), patent ductus arteriosus, low blood pressure, chronic lung changes and bleeding in the brain. The syndrome is frequently complicated by prematurity and its additional effect on other organ functions.

== Histopathology ==
The characteristic histopathology seen in babies who die from RDS was the source of the name &quot;hyaline membrane disease&quot;. Waxlike layers of hyaline membrane line the collapsed alveoli of the lung. In addition, the lungs show bleeding, overdistention of airways, and damage to the lining cells.

== Pathophysiology ==
The lungs of infants with respiratory distress syndrome are developmentally deficient in a material called surfactant, which helps prevent the collapse of the terminal air spaces (the future site of alveolar development) throughout the normal cycle of inhalation and exhalation. This deficiency of surfactant is related to inhibition from the insulin that is produced in the newborn, especially those of diabetic mothers.

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex system of lipids, proteins and glycoproteins that is produced in specialized lung cells called Type II cells or Type II pneumocytes. The surfactant is packaged by the cell in structures called lamellar bodies, and extruded into the air spaces. The lamellar bodies then unfold into a complex lining of the air space. This layer reduces the surface tension of the fluid that lines the alveolar air space. Surface tension is responsible for approximately 2/3 of the inward elastic recoil forces. In the same way that a bubble will contract to give the smallest surface area for a given volume, so the air/water interface means that the liquid surface will tend toward being as small as possible, thereby causing the air space to contract. By reducing surface tension, surfactant prevents the air spaces from completely collapsing on exhalation. In addition, the decreased surface tension allows reopening of the air space with a lower amount of force. Therefore, without adequate amounts of surfactant, the air spaces collapse and are very difficult to expand.

Microscopically, a pulmonary surfactant-deficient lung is characterized by collapsed air spaces alternating with hyperexpanded areas, vascular congestion, and, in time, hyaline membranes. Hyaline membranes are composed of fibrin, cellular debris, red blood cells, rare neutrophils and macrophages. They appear as an eosinophilic, amorphous material, lining or filling the air spaces and blocking gas exchange. As a result, blood passing through the lungs is unable to pick up oxygen and unload carbon dioxide. Blood oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide rises, resulting in rising blood acid levels and hypoxia. Structural immaturity, as manifested by a decreased number of gas exchange units and thicker walls, also contributes to the disease process. Therapeutic oxygen and positive-pressure ventilation, while potentially life-saving, can damage the lung.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is made by the clinical picture and the chest X-ray, which demonstrates decreased lung volumes (bell-shaped chest), absence of the thymus (after about six hours), a small (0.5–1 mm), discrete, uniform infiltrate (sometimes described as a &quot;ground glass&quot; appearance or &quot;diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities&quot;) that involves all lobes of the lung and air-bronchograms (i.e. the infiltrate will outline the larger airways passages, which remain air-filled). In severe cases, this becomes exaggerated until the cardiac borders become indiscernible (a &#x27;white-out&#x27; appearance).

=== Point-of-care lung maturity test ===
To improve clinical outcomes very early treatment with surfactant is necessary. However, only about half of infants with a gestational age (GA) below 30 weeks need surfactant treatment and prophylactic surfactant treatment increases the combined mortality and incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) contrary to selective rescue surfactant treatment. Therefore, there is a need for a rapid diagnostic test to guide early targeted surfactant treatment.

Professor Henrik Verder has worked with lung-maturity diagnostics on gastric aspirates obtained at birth for over 15 years. With the introduction of surfactant treatment for IRDS, Henrik Verder developed additional lung maturity tests based on gastric aspirates (GAS); for example, the microbubble stability test and lamellar body counts (LBC) as well as a large randomised trial using lamellar body counts to guide surfactant treatment. However, a common problem with all these methods is dilution with foetal urine. Additionally, the methods are time‐consuming laboratory tests and are too slow to be used as a point‐of‐care test (POC) to guide surfactant treatment.

Professor Henrik Verder, in collaboration with chemometric scientist Agnar Hoskuldsson, developed a rapid point-of-care method for predicting IRDS by measuring the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (L/S) in gastric aspirate (GA). The new method, which is based on mid‐red Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), was shown to measure the L/S ratio at birth with a high sensitivity. This rapid bedside test for surfactant components in gastric aspirate is also now available, and clinical trials of this new point-of-care test to determine surfactant need at birth are underway.

=== Lung ultrasound ===
Lung ultrasound, with appropriate expertise, equipment, and training, may offer an alternative way to diagnose the severity of IRDS. A semi-quantitative lung ultrasound score performed during bedside lung echography was first described by Brat et al. and found to correlate with the oxygenation status of infants with RDS. Since then, several studies have supported the use of lung ultrasound scores to earlier predict an initial dose of surfactant when compared to current oxygenation-guided recommendations.

== Treatment ==
Oxygen is given with a small amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and intravenous fluids are administered to stabilize the blood sugar, blood salts and blood pressure. CPAP application to preterm neonates with respiratory distress is associated with a reduction in respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation and mortality. However, CPAP is associated with an increased rate of pneumothorax compared to spontaneous breathing with or without supplemental oxygen. If the baby&#x27;s condition worsens, an endotracheal tube (breathing tube) is inserted into the trachea and intermittent breaths are given by a mechanical device. An exogenous preparation of pulmonary surfactant, either synthetic or extracted from animal lungs, is given through the breathing tube into the lungs. Surfactant medications can decrease the risk of death for very low-birth-weight infants who are hospitalized by 30%. Such small premature infants may remain ventilated for months. A study shows that an aerosol of a perfluorocarbon such as perfluoromethyldecalin can reduce inflammation in swine model of IRDS. Chronic lung disease, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, is common in severe RDS. The etiology of BPD is problematic and may be the result of oxygen, overventilation or underventilation. The mortality rate for babies greater than 27 weeks of gestation is less than 20%.

=== INSURE (Intubation Surfactant Extubation) and LISA (Less Invasive Surfactant Administration) methods ===
Henrik Verder is the inventor and pioneer of the INSURE (Intubation Surfactant Extubation) and LISA (Less Invasive Surfactant Administration) methods combined with nasal CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), very effective approaches to managing preterm neonates with respiratory distress. In 1989 he used this pioneering method to successfully treat the first premature infant with severe RDS.

The INSURE method has been shown, through meta-analysis, to successfully decrease the use of mechanical ventilation and lower the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Since its conception in 1989, the INSURE method has been academically cited in more than 500 papers. The first randomised study involving the INSURE method was published in 1994 and a second randomised study in infants less than 30 weeks gestation was published by the group in 1999. Based on the INSURE method, Henrik Verder has since developed a rapid bedside test that predicts IRDS at birth.

=== Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ===
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a potential treatment, providing oxygenation through an apparatus that imitates the gas exchange process of the lungs. However, newborns cannot be placed on ECMO if they are under 4.5 pounds (2 kg), because they have extremely small vessels for cannulation, thus hindering adequate flow because of limitations from cannula size and subsequent higher resistance to blood flow (compare with vascular resistance). Furthermore, in infants aged less than 34 weeks of gestation, several physiologic systems are not well-developed, especially the cerebral vasculature and germinal matrix, resulting in high sensitivity to slight changes in pH, PaO2 and intracranial pressure. Subsequently, preterm infants are at unacceptably high risk for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) if administered ECMO at a gestational age of less than 32 weeks.

== Prevention ==
Giving the baby&#x27;s mother glucocorticoids speeds the production of surfactant. For very premature deliveries, a glucocorticoid is given without testing the fetal lung maturity. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Royal College of Medicine and other major organizations have recommended antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for women at risk for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation. Multiple courses of glucocorticoid administration, compared with a single course, do not seem to increase or decrease the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disorders of the child.

In pregnancies of longer than 30 weeks, the fetal lung maturity may be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid by amniocentesis, wherein a needle is inserted through the mother&#x27;s abdomen and uterus. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant. These include the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (&quot;L/S ratio&quot;), the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and, more recently, the surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio. For the L/S ratio, if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be deficient in surfactant. The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity. For the S/A ratio, the result is given as milligrams of surfactant per gram of protein. A S/A ratio less than 35 indicates immature lungs, between 35 and 55 is indeterminate, and greater than 55 indicates mature surfactant production (correlating with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater).

== Epidemiology ==
Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) is the leading cause of death in premature infants. Despite only 1% of all birth complications being attributed to respiratory distress syndrome, there is a significantly higher prevalence in prematurely born babies. Incidence rates of IRDS in premature infants born at 30 weeks of gestational age (GA) are at 50%, and rise even higher to 93% for infants born prematurely at 28 weeks of gestational age or younger. IRDS is diagnosed within hours of delivery and usually leads to morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. There are many risk factors that can potentially cause IRDS. The most common risks factors that can potentially cause IRDS include male gender, white race, late preterm delivery, maternal diabetes, perinatal hypoxia (exposure to low oxygen) and ischemia (decreased blood flow), and low birth weight. Seventy percent of babies diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome are born between 29 and 34 weeks of gestational age and are 55% more likely to be male. A study conducted at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network studied premature infants born between 22 and 37 weeks and the outcomes leading to IRDS. This study was conducted from 2002 to 2008. The incidence rate of IRDS for 24 weeks was 98%, for 34 weeks the incidence is 5%, and for 37 weeks the incidence rate was less than 1%. The results demonstrate that the incidence of IRDS increases with decreasing age at birth.

According to a study from the University of Miami&#x27;s Department of Pediatrics and Division of Neonatology, from the time range of 2003 to 2014, respiratory distress syndrome prevalence jumped from 170 per 1000 preterm live births to 360 per 1000 preterm live births nationwide in the United States. This study population&#x27;s duration under hospital care averaged 32 days in 2003, increasing by nearly a week to 38 days in 2014. Additionally, this study yielded average prevalence rates of 260 cases per 1000 livebirths from the years of 2003 to 2014, which coincided with the results yielded by a report from the Vermont Oxford Network in 2008 of 300 per 1000 livebirths.

<text>&#x27;, or Law of the Splintered Paddle (also translated Law of the Splintered Oar), also known as &#x27;, translated as sanctity of life law, is a precept in Hawaiian law, originating with King Kamehameha I in 1797. The law, &quot;Let every elderly person, woman and child lie by the roadside in safety,&quot; is enshrined in the state constitution, Article 9, Section 10, and has become a model for modern human rights law regarding the treatment of civilians and other non-combatants during times of war. 

The law was created as a result of an incident when Kamehameha was on a military expedition in Puna. His party encountered a group of commoners on a beach. While chasing two fishermen who had stayed behind to cover the retreat of a man carrying a child, Kamehameha&#x27;s leg was caught in the reef. One of the fisherman, Kaleleiki, hit him mightily on the head with a paddle in defense, which broke into pieces. Kamehameha could have been killed at that point, but the fisherman spared him. Years later, the same fisherman was brought before Kamehameha. Instead of ordering for him to be killed, Kamehameha ruled that the fisherman had only been protecting his land and family, and so the Law of the Splintered Paddle was declared.

==Cultural context==
 was not a completely new invention of Kamehameha I, but rather an articulation of concepts regarding governmental legitimacy that had been held in Hawaiʻi for many prior generations. Countless stories abound in Hawaiian folklore of the removal of chiefs – generally, but not always, through popular execution – as a result of mistreatment of the common people, who have traditionally been intolerant of bad government. Both a shrewd politician and leader, as well as a skilled warrior, Kamehameha used these concepts to turn what could have been a point of major popular criticism to his political advantage, while protecting the human rights of his people for future generations.

==Modern relevance and controversy==
 has been applied to Hawaiian rights, elder law, children&#x27;s rights, homeless advocacy, and bicyclist safety. It also appears as a symbol of crossed paddles in the center of the badge of the Honolulu Police Department. Since 1955, the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii has inducted local and national figures into the &quot;Order of the Splintered Paddle&quot; to recognize contributions to community welfare. The first recipient was President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

It is an unofficial symbol of the William S. Richardson School of Law, reflecting its ethos for legal education. As such, particularly in consideration of the human rights concerns of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement (in which the annexation and establishment of the State of Hawaii is generally viewed as illegal because it was accomplished through legislation instead of a separate treaty), has been the subject of extended controversy.

Issues surround the use of the law of Kamehameha I in the state&#x27;s constitution and the treatment of homeless persons, especially those of native descent, many of whom reside upon ancestral lands that have been converted to public use or private property under State law. &quot;The Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot; published an editorial discussing modern-day application of the Law of the Splintered Paddle to contemporary homeless populations living in Hawaii. The editorial advocated for support of House Bill 1889 introduced in the Hawaii legislature in 2014 and recognized a homeless persons&#x27; bill of rights.

<text>Chewing or mastication is the process by which food is crushed and ground by the teeth. It is the first step in the process of digestion, allowing a greater surface area for digestive enzymes to break down the foods.

During the mastication process, the food is positioned by the cheek and tongue between the teeth for grinding. The muscles of mastication move the jaws to bring the teeth into intermittent contact, repeatedly occluding and opening. As chewing continues, the food is made softer and warmer, and the enzymes in saliva begin to break down carbohydrates in the food. After chewing, the food (now called a bolus) is swallowed. It enters the esophagus and via peristalsis continues on to the stomach, where the next step of digestion occurs. Increasing the number of chews per bite increases relevant gut hormones. Studies suggest that chewing may decrease self-reported hunger and food intake. Chewing gum has been around for many centuries; there is evidence that northern Europeans chewed birch bark tar 9,000 years ago. 

Chewing, needing specialized teeth, is mostly a mammalian adaptation that appeared in early Synapsids, though some later herbivorous dinosaurs, since extinct, had developed chewing too. Nowadays, only mammals chew in the strict sense of the word, though some fishes have a somewhat similar behavior. Neither birds, nor amphibians or any living reptiles chew. 

Premastication is sometimes performed by human parents for infants who are unable to do so for themselves. The food is masticated in the mouth of the parent into a bolus and then transferred to the infant for consumption (some other animals also premasticate).

Cattle and some other animals, called ruminants, chew food more than once to extract more nutrients. After the first round of chewing, this food is called cud.

==Chewing motor program==

Chewing is primarily an unconscious (semi-autonomic) act, but can be mediated by higher conscious input. The motor program for mastication is a hypothesized central nervous system function by which the complex patterns governing mastication are created and controlled.

It is thought that feedback from proprioceptive nerves in teeth and the temporomandibular joints govern the creation of neural pathways, which in turn determine duration and force of individual muscle activation (and in some cases muscle fiber groups as in the masseter and temporalis).

This motor program continuously adapts to changes in food type or occlusion. This adaptation is a learned skill that may sometimes require relearning to adapt to loss of teeth or to dental appliances such as dentures.

It is thought that conscious mediation is important in the limitation of parafunctional habits as most commonly, the motor program can be excessively engaged during periods of sleep and times of stress. It is also theorized that excessive input to the motor program from myofascial pain or occlusal imbalance can contribute to parafunctional habits.

== Nutrition and health ==

Chewing stimulates saliva production and increases sensory perception of the food being eaten, controlling when the food is swallowed. Evidence from one study suggests that chewing almonds 25-40 times kept people fuller while also allowing them to get more nutrients out of the almonds. The researchers also suggest that this is likely to be the case in other foods. A 2015 systemic review found evidence that chewing can decrease self-reported hunger and therefore food intake. Eating food which does not require chewing, by choice or for medical reasons as tooth loss, is known as a soft diet. Such a diet may lead to inadequate nutrition due to a reduction in fruit and vegetable intake.

Chewing also stimulates the hippocampus and is necessary to maintain its normal function. Chewing stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis in both humans and mice.

==In other animals==
Chewing is largely an adaptation for mammalian herbivory. Carnivores generally chew very little or swallow their food whole or in chunks. This act of gulping food (or medicine pills) without chewing has inspired the English idiom &quot;wolfing it down&quot;.

Other animals such as cows chew their food for long periods to allow for proper digestion in a process known as rumination. Rumination in cows has been shown by researchers to intensify during the night. They concluded that cows chewed more intently in the night time compared to the morning.

Ornithopods, a group of dinosaurs including the Hadrosaurids (&quot;duck-bills&quot;), developed teeth analogous to mammalian molars and incisors during the Cretaceous period; this advanced, cow-like dentition allowed the creatures to obtain more nutrients from the tough plant life. This may have given them the advantage needed to compete with the formidable sauropods, who depended on their massive gastrointestinal tracts to digest food without grinding it.

==In machinery==

The process of chewing has, by analogy, been applied to machinery. The U.S. Forest Service uses a machine called a &quot;masticator&quot; (also called a forestry mulching machine) to &quot;chew&quot; through brush and timber in order to clear firelines in advance of a wildfire.

<doc id="789883" wikidata="Q143888" url="?curid=789883" title="Humboldt Current">
<text>The Humboldt Current, also called the Peru Current, is a cold, low-salinity ocean current that flows north along the western coast of South America. It is an eastern boundary current flowing in the direction of the equator, and extends offshore. The Humboldt Current is named after the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt even though it was discovered by José de Acosta 250 years before Humboldt. In 1846, von Humboldt reported measurements of the cold-water current in his book &quot;Cosmos&quot;.

The current extends from southern Chile (~45th parallel south) to northern Peru (~4th parallel south) where cold, upwelled, waters intersect warm tropical waters to form the Equatorial Front. Sea surface temperatures off the coast of Peru, around 5th parallel south, reach temperatures as low as . This is highly uncharacteristic of tropical waters, as most other regions have temperatures measuring above . Upwelling brings nutrients to the surface, which support phytoplankton and ultimately increase biological productivity.

The Humboldt Current is a highly productive ecosystem. It is the most productive eastern boundary current system. It accounts for roughly 18-20% of the total worldwide marine fish catch. The species are mostly pelagic: sardines, anchovies and jack mackerel. The system&#x27;s high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals (eared seals and cetaceans) and seabirds. Periodically, the upwelling that drives the system&#x27;s productivity is disrupted by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, often with large social and economic impacts.

The Humboldt has a considerable cooling influence on the climate of Chile, Peru and Ecuador. It is also largely responsible for the aridity of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and coastal areas of Peru and also of the aridity of southern Ecuador. Marine air is cooled by the current and thus is not conducive to generating precipitation (although clouds and fog are produced).

== Physical oceanography ==
The trade winds are the primary drivers of the Humboldt Current circulation. Variability in this system is driven by latitudinal shifts between the Intertropical Convergent Zone and the trade winds in the north. Shifts within the South Pacific High at mid-latitudes, as well as cyclonic storms and movement of the Southern Westerlies southward also contribute to system changes. Atmospheric variability off central Chile is enhanced by the aggravation of coastal low pressure systems trapped between the marine boundary layer and the coastal mountains. This is prominent poleward from 27th parallel south to 42nd parallel south.

The Humboldt current, occupying the upper ocean, flows equatorward carrying fresh, cold Sub-Antarctic surface water northward, along the outskirts of the subtropical gyre. The main flow of the current veers offshore in southern Peru, as a weaker limb continues to flow equatorward. Around 18th parallel south the fresh, cold waters begin to mix with the warm, high salinity Subtropical Surface waters. This collision causes partial subductions. Within this region, the equatorial undercurrent (EUC) flows eastward along the equator, feeding the Peru-Chile undercurrent (PCU) that moves poleward.

Off the coast of central Chile, there is a coastal transition zone (CTZ), which is characterized by high eddy kinetic energy. This energy forms mesoscale eddies which extend offshore. The CTZ has three distinct regions within its boundaries:

# high chlorophyll-a concentrations in wide regions off the coast of Peru (10–15°S), 
# high chlorophyll-a concentrations in wide regions off the coast of Chile (30°S), and
# high chlorophyll-a concentrations in narrow regions off the coast of northern Chile (Montecino and Lange 2008). High chlorophyll-a concentrations are generally found within 50 km of the coast.

The limb of the Humboldt Current System that veers off the coast of Peru creates a decrease in ventilation within the system. This lack of ventilation is the primary driver of an intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) which is formed in the sub-surface to intermediate depths. In the north, the EUC ventilates the OMZ, and in the south the PCU advects low oxygen waters southward towards northern Chile. This OMZ is the fourth largest permanent hypoxic zone in the world&#x27;s oceans. It occupies an area about 2.18 ± 0.66 × 106 km3. The core of this zone is centered off Peru, creating a shallow upper boundary that reaches from about down to . Another factor contributing to the OMZ is sinking and decay of primary productive resources.

Consequently, the OMZ forces many organisms to stay near the surface where nutrients and oxygen are obtainable. The presence of a shallow OMZ restricts the migration of zooplankton within the water column. Between , many species of zooplankton occupy this space within the OMZ. This allows for a substantial exchange of carbon between the euphotic layer and the OMZ. 75% of the total zooplankton biomass move in and out of the OMZ. The OMZ also serves as a refuge for organisms that can live in hypoxic conditions.

Coastal upwelling is the main factor contributing to the high biological productivity of the Humboldt current. Upwelling within the current is not uniform across the entire system. Three notable upwelling subsystems are produced by this current:

# seasonal upwelling in Chile only during the spring and summer, because of the displacement of the subtropical center of high pressure during the period January–March, 
# upwelling &quot;shadow&quot; that is less productive, but still large in northern Chile and Southern Peru, and
# highly productive year-round upwelling in Peru. The upwelling shadow identified between 35°S and 15°S is caused by the oligotrophic subtropical gyre impinging on the coast. This creates a narrow, but highly productive, upwelling zone.

== Biological productivity ==
Due to the upwelling zones within the Humboldt current, biological diversity is extremely high. The Humboldt Current is considered a Class I, highly productive (&gt;300 gC/m2/yr) ecosystem. The current hosts a wide range of organisms including multiple species of plankton, mollusks, sea urchins, crustaceans, fish, and marine mammals. The food web starts with the phytoplankton. The conditions of the Humboldt current are prime for these organisms to thrive. This causes a cascade effect in which larger and larger organisms are drawn to the area.

== Fisheries ==
The Humboldt current produces some of the most successful commercial fisheries in the world. The major catches include: sardines, anchovies, mackerel, hake, and squid. Three major stocks of anchoveta are distributed between 4°S and 42°S within the Humboldt Current System. North-central Peru&#x27;s fishery is primarily composed of one stock of anchoveta. Sardines, chub mackerel, and bonito are also common catches, but not as prominent, in Peru. Southern Peru and Northern Chile host a major sardine fishery. Other common stocks include: a second anchoveta stock, jack mackerel, tuna, and swordfish. Anchoveta, jack mackerel, and sardines are the primary commercial stocks in central Chile.

Anchoveta are found in more recently upwelled waters, close to the coast. Sardines, on the other hand, are typically found farther offshore. Seasonal upwelling plays a major role in the spawning behaviors of both sardines and anchoveta. By spawning at the end of winter, egg and larval survival is greatly enhanced. This is due to the moderate upwelling, which causes lower turbulence, as well as a weakened Ekman drift offshore. These two species experience population shifts related to climate changes and environmental events such as El Niño. This is due to changes in the availability of each species habitat. Anchoveta are an important component in the diets of marine mammals, seabirds, and larger fish. Shifts in these populations ultimately cause a shift in the energy processing within the Humboldt Current System.

Jack mackerel (jurel) is the second largest fishery in the Humboldt Current System. As with the anchoveta in Peru, this species is believed to be composed of a single stock. Jurel are a straddling species. This means the species is found both within and outside of the 200-mile economic exclusive zone. Jurel became an important fishery in the 1970s to alleviate the pressure put on the anchoveta stock. During the 1980s, however, the jurel decreased in population size due to poor recruitment and overfishing. Restrictions of jurel fishing were imposed in 1998 which led to regrowth of the population. Since 2002, the jurel population is now under full exploitation.

Between 1993 and 2008, the hake fishery in Peru declined significantly. This was due to overfishing, environmental stress, and decreased reproductive capacity. The Chilean hake population in central-south Chile catch exceeded 100,000 tons, and dropped to 40,000 tons in 2007.

== Influence of El Niño ==
The productivity of the Humboldt Current System is strongly affected by El Niño and La Niña events. During an El Niño event, the thermocline and upper region of the OMZ deepen to greater than 600 m. This causes a loss of nitrogen and decrease in export of carbon. El Niño also causes poleward currents to increase in velocity. During non-El Niño years, productivity is very high due to the high nutrient contents, nitrogen recycling through processes such as denitrification, increased carbon export, and remineralization.

During El Niño events, fish abundance and distribution are significantly affected, often leading to stock crashes and cascading social and economic impacts. These events have led to sequential changes, where sardines and anchovies have replaced each other periodically as the dominant species in the ecosystem. These species changes can have negative consequences for the fishing industry and the economies of the countries that fish the system. The anchoveta fishery in Peru was booming during the 1960s. In 1970, catches were reported to exceed 12 million tons per year. This accounted for 20% of the world&#x27;s catches. An El Niño event occurred during 1972 and caused the anchoveta population to collapse. However, sardine populations saw a dramatic increase in the next 15–20 years. Consequently, sardine fisheries grew in this &quot;regime shift&quot;.

<text>Orkut Büyükkökten (born February 6, 1975) is a Turkish software engineer who developed the social networking services Club Nexus, inCircle and Orkut. He is a former product manager at Google.

== Early life and education ==
Originally from Konya, Turkey, Büyükkökten obtained a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering and Information Science from Bilkent University in Ankara. He received both a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University. His research at Stanford focused on Web search and efficient PDA usage.

== Social media platforms ==

He has been building and working on online communities since 2000. He introduced his first social network, named Club Nexus, at Stanford in the fall of 2001. Club Nexus was the first college-specific social network. It was a system built to serve the networking and communication needs of the Stanford online community. Students could use Club Nexus to send e-mail and invitations, chat, post events, buy and sell used goods, search for people with similar interests, place personals, display their artwork or post editorial columns. Within a few months of its introduction in 2001, Club Nexus had attracted over 2,000 Stanford undergraduates.

Later, Büyükkökten introduced an alumni social network, named inCircle, for the Stanford Alumni Association intended for use by university alumni groups. In 2002, Büyükkökten launched a company, Affinity Engines, to commercialize inCircle and Club Nexus.

After leaving Affinity Engines and joining Google, he decided to use his 20% time to develop a social networking service. He said: &quot;My dream was to connect all the Internet users so they can relate to each other, it can make such a difference in people&#x27;s lives.&quot; The product manager and Marissa Mayer thought of naming the service after its creator. &quot;Orkut.com&quot; belonged to Orkut Büyükkökten himself. Google convinced him, and its social networking service was called Orkut.

Büyükkökten and Google were sued by Affinity Engines in 2004 for trade secret misappropriation. Affinity Engines claimed that Büyükkökten and Google had stolen Affinity Engines&#x27; code to launch the &quot;Orkut.com&quot; social networking service at Google. The lawsuit was settled in 2006.

In 2016, he launched a new social networking service, Hello. The social networking site can be customized in three languages — English, French and Portuguese. By August 2016, Hello was available in the US, Canada, France, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Brazil — both on iOS and Android. Hello announced its entry into the Indian market in April 2018. By September 2022, Hello had shut down.

<text>The Met Center was an indoor arena that stood in Bloomington, Minnesota, United States, a suburb of Minneapolis. The arena, which was completed in 1967 by Minnesota Ice, just to the north of Metropolitan Stadium, seated 15,000. It was the home of the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1967 to 1993. For its first 15 years, its official name was the Metropolitan Sports Center; the more familiar shorter name was adopted in 1982.

The Met&#x27;s other tenants included the ABA&#x27;s Minnesota Muskies, which played just one season before moving to Miami for the 1968–69 season. The league responded by moving the defending champion Pittsburgh Pipers to Bloomington, but the Pipers left to return to Pittsburgh after the season. The NASL&#x27;s Minnesota Kicks played two indoor seasons at the Met from 1979 to 1981. The Minnesota Strikers of the Major Soccer League (MSL) played indoor soccer at the Met Center from 1984 to 1988. The Boys&#x27; High School Hockey Tournament was also held there from 1969 to 1975.

The arena also held entertainment-related shows, including the first performance of &quot;Sesame Street Live&quot; in September 1980.

==History==
The Met Center was considered to be one of the finest arenas in the NHL for many years. Among NHL players, the Met was known for its fast ice and good lighting. Players also had much praise for the locker rooms and training facilities. Fans gave the arena&#x27;s sightlines very high marks as well. The Met never boasted fancy amenities, and had cramped concourses and very few frills compared to modern arenas (though some luxury suites were added in the 1980s). As a sports facility, it could best be described as utilitarian, a theme which repeated itself in most Minnesota sports facilities built before 1988 (such as Metropolitan Stadium and the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome). Like the Metrodome, the Met Center was heavily utilized as a Minnesota sports venue, hosting various high school hockey and basketball events over the course of its lifetime. The North Stars turned down a chance to move to the new Target Center upon its opening in 1990 due to conflicting soft drink rights (the Met Center was served by Pepsi whereas the Target Center&#x27;s pouring rights belonged to Coca-Cola).

After the North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas, in 1993 and became the Dallas Stars, the Met Center was demolished on December 13, 1994, in a series of three controlled implosions. The series of implosions was required after the initial detonation (which was intended to be the only one) failed spectacularly to bring down the building on live television. The NHL returned to Minnesota in 2000 when the expansion Minnesota Wild began play at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Meanwhile, the Harlem Globetrotters, an annual visitor to the Met Center, moved on, as had a large portion of Met Center&#x27;s concert business, to Target Center.

For several years after the arena was demolished, the property served as an overflow lot for the Mall of America. In 2004, an IKEA store opened on the west end of the property, and the new American Boulevard was rerouted through the east end of the property. The remainder of the site is planned long-term to become the site of Mall of America Phase II, of which the IKEA would be an anchor store.

<doc id="789903" wikidata="Q115760" url="?curid=789903" title="Catwoman (film)">
<text>Catwoman is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Pitof and written by John Rogers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris from a story by Theresa Rebeck, Brancato and Ferris, with music by Klaus Badelt. It is loosely based on the DC Comics character Catwoman. The film stars Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Lambert Wilson, Frances Conroy, Alex Borstein, and Sharon Stone. Its plot centers on Patience Phillips, a meek graphic designer, who discovers a conspiracy within the cosmetics company she works for that involves a dangerous product that could cause widespread health problems. After being discovered and murdered by the conspirators, Patience is revived by an Egyptian mau cat that grants her superhuman cat-like abilities, allowing her to become the crime-fighting superheroine Catwoman.

Produced by Village Roadshow Pictures and Denise Di Novi&#x27;s Di Novi Pictures, &quot;Catwoman&quot; was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on July 23, 2004. It grossed $82.4 million against a budget of $100 million and was considered a box office disappointment. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and is considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Additionally, it also received seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations, winning Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Berry), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.

==Plot==

Artist Patience Phillips is an intelligent, hard working and meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend Sally. She works for a cosmetics company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-line that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, when Patience visits the R&amp;D laboratory facility to deliver a redone ad design, she overhears a discussion between scientist Dr. Ivan Slavicky and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous side effects from continually using the product. Laurel&#x27;s guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore, Patience is mysteriously revived by an Egyptian Mau cat named Midnight which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like attributes.

From Midnight&#x27;s owner, eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess Bast. Patience realizes that she is now a &quot;Catwoman&quot;, reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. While at home, Patience is annoyed by the ruckus caused by her neighbor’s party and lashes out by spraying the amplifiers to mute the noise. Disguised as a mysterious vigilante, named Catwoman to hide her identity, Patience, under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky&#x27;s body and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is attending an opera with another woman) as Catwoman, he reveals that he knows nothing about the side effects. The police led by Patience&#x27;s love interest, detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders George for his growing suspicions and infidelity and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product&#x27;s release. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder, planning to release Beau-line to the public the following day. Tom then takes Catwoman into custody.

Patience slips out of her cell and confronts Laurel in her office, rescuing Tom, who came to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience&#x27;s guilt, in the process and revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. As they fight, Patience sees she&#x27;s unable to hurt Laurel. Laurel reveals the product&#x27;s side effects: discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble and the user impervious to pain. During the fight, she scratches Laurel&#x27;s face several times, causing Laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a broken glass pipe. Laurel sees her rapidly disfiguring face in a window&#x27;s reflection, and horrified, she fails to grab hold of Patience&#x27;s outstretched hand, and falls to her death.

Although Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to continue living outside the law and enjoy her newfound freedom as Catwoman.

Missy Peregrym appears uncredited as the Hedare factory computer monitor image (Beau-line graphics model), depicting the bad effects of the beauty product. A photograph of Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; is among various photographs that Ophelia uses to explain the history of former Catwomen.

==Production==
===Development===
With Warner Bros. developing &quot;Batman Forever&quot; in June 1993, a &quot;Catwoman&quot; spin-off film was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was cast to reprise her role from &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Tim Burton became attached as director, and producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct &quot;Catwoman&quot; or an adaptation of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. On June 16, 1995, Waters turned in his &quot;Catwoman&quot; script to Warner Bros., the same day &quot;Batman Forever&quot; was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked that &quot;turning it in the day &quot;Batman Forever&quot; opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it&#x27;s the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. &quot;Catwoman&quot; is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script&quot;. In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer reiterated her interest in the spin-off but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.

The film labored in development hell for years with Ashley Judd as the lead in 2001, but she eventually dropped out so Nicole Kidman was considered. When Warner Bros. canceled a &quot;Batman vs. Superman&quot; film scheduled for 2004, the studio decided to quickly produce &quot;Catwoman&quot; as replacement, starring Halle Berry. Warner Bros. mandated that the film should be separate from the Batman universe and not have the character mentioned. Berry chose to be involved with the film after the cancellation of &quot;Jinx&quot;, a James Bond spin-off featuring her character Giacinta &quot;Jinx&quot; Johnson from &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002). Josh Lucas was considered for the role of Tom Lone.

===Costume===
The catsuit was designed by Academy Award-winning costume designer Angus Strathie together with Berry, director Pitof, and producers Di Novi and McDonnell. Strathie explained that they wanted a &quot;reality-based wardrobe to show the progression from demure, repressed Patience to the sensual awakening of a sexy warrior goddess&quot;.

===Choreography and training===
Berry started intensive fitness training with Harley Pasternak in June 2003. Choreographer Anne Fletcher instructed Berry in cat-like movement, and in the Brazilian martial art style Capoeira. Berry was trained to crack a whip by coach Alex Green.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in late September 2003. Shooting took place on 4th Street in downtown Los Angeles, California, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, at Lionsgate Film Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, and at Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California. Most of the cats cast in the film came from animal shelters throughout California. Filming finished in March 2004.

Pitof said reshoots happened as late as June 2004 — one month before release — after working cuts yielded confusing, incomplete dialogue sequences and awkward visual transitions. New scenes were added, including a fresh ending that shifted Patience’s relationship with Tom from a “romantic comedy”-style conclusion, as Pitof calls it, to a darker, open-ended closer.

==Release==

===Theatrical===
The film was originally given an IMAX release coinciding with the general release as evidenced by a poster with the tagline &quot;CATch Her in IMAX&quot;, but Warner Bros. announced its cancellation on June 30, 2004, because the delays on the visual effects did not give IMAX enough time to remaster the film in time for its release.

===Home media===
&quot;Catwoman&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on January 18, 2005, and on Blu-ray on September 8, 2009.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Catwoman&quot; grossed $40.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $42.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $82.4 million against a production budget of $100 million, becoming a box office flop.

The film grossed $16.7 million in its opening weekend at 3,117 theaters with a $5,366 per-theatre average, ranking third behind &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;I, Robot&quot;. The biggest market in other territories being France, Spain, Japan and Mexico where the film grossed $5.2 million, $4.05 million, $3.05 million and $2.9 million, while topping the Bulgarian weekend listing.

===Critical response===
The film was critically panned. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reported that the critics &quot;universally—and predictably—tore apart &quot;Catwoman&quot;&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 3.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Halle Berry is the lone bright spot, but even she can&#x27;t save this laughable action thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The review from &quot;San Diego Metropolitan Magazine&quot; praised Berry&#x27;s appearance in the suit, the dynamic action sequences with Catwoman&#x27;s whip and the director&#x27;s efforts to maintain momentum, but criticized the film&#x27;s script and logical consistency, highlighting the absurdity of certain scenes, and found the actors struggling &quot;to make sense&quot; of the script, ultimately deeming it one of the worst of the year. In a negative review, Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; explained that the film &quot;seems destined to join &quot;Showgirls&quot; and its ilk as a fast-starting and even faster-fading theatrical release that could enjoy an afterlife as a midnight movie and video/DVD item where viewers supply alternate dialogue&quot;.

The film appeared on the list of Roger Ebert&#x27;s most hated films. He criticized the filmmakers for giving little thought to providing Berry &quot;with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences&quot;, but he primarily criticized the film for failing to give the audience a sense of what her character experienced as she was transformed into Catwoman. He rather referred to it as being a movie &quot;about Halle Berry&#x27;s beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips, and costume design. It gets those right&quot;. On their &quot;At the Movies&quot; show, Ebert and his former co-host Richard Roeper both gave the film a &quot;thumbs down&quot;.

In a scholarly analysis of female protagonists in action cinema, Caroline Heldman &quot;et al&quot; said that the film ends with Catwoman choosing &quot;a solo existence as her sexualized body slinks into the full moon; even this otherwise agentic act is constructed for the consumption of the male gaze that follows her. The film presents her agency, power, and freedom as derivative of her hypersexualization&quot;. Bill Muller of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; stated that Berry should possibly give back her 2001 Academy Award as a penalty for the film.

In July 2024, the 20th anniversary of Catwoman, &quot;IndieWire&quot; described the film as a &quot;superhero cult classic&quot; that &quot;has become a sleeper hit&quot;. The film&#x27;s director Pitof says Catwoman was “ahead of its time” and &quot;People weren’t ready for that kind of movie,&quot; due to the film starring the first African American woman as a superhero and states &quot;Now, after some key movements, we have more diversity and inclusiveness. Younger audiences see things differently and are much more open. Back then, comic book fans hated the movie because the film didn’t involve Batman; with a new generation, it’s not a problem. They take it as it is.&quot;.

Despite Catwoman being panned by critics who said &quot;it sucked balls&quot; Berry says she loves the film, loved working on it, and is happy that it has gained newfound popularity from a new generation.

===Accolades===
Berry arrived at the ceremony to accept her Razzie in person while carrying her Best Actress Oscar. She semi-sarcastically described the finished film as &quot;a god-awful movie&quot; and quipped, &quot;It was just what my career needed&quot;. She later explained that &quot;The studio [Warner Bros.] knew what I was going to do at the Razzies. I told them I wanted to take the piss out of it and laugh at it [...] I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a God-awful film, but I was at the Razzies, so I had to do what they do; I shit on it because they shit on it! I wrote [that speech] within an inch of my life. I put a lot of thought into how I could do it in a fun way and let everyone know I didn&#x27;t take it that seriously. You can never take away my Oscar, no matter how bad you bash me! If you say I earned it, I&#x27;ll take this, too.&quot;

==Оther media==

A video game based on the film was published by Electronic Arts UK and Argonaut Games. Featuring voice actor Jennifer Hale, the game varies from the film&#x27;s plot and received negative reviews on Metacritic.

In 2003, Warner Bros. approached Boyd Kirkland to write a script for a &quot;Catwoman&quot; direct-to-video animated feature film to tie-in with the film&#x27;s release. Although the script was written, the project was discarded due to the film&#x27;s critical and box office failure.

<text>Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is an American multinational financial services corporation specializing in retail brokerage. It is the wealth &amp; asset management division of Morgan Stanley.
On January 13, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup announced that Citigroup would sell 51% of Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley, creating Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which was formerly a division of Citi Global Wealth Management. The combined brokerage house has 17,646 financial advisors and manages $2 trillion in client assets. Clients range from individual investors to small- and mid-sized businesses, as well as large corporations, non-profit organizations and family foundations.

On September 25, 2012, Morgan Stanley announced that its U.S. wealth management business was renamed &quot;Morgan Stanley Wealth Management&quot;. The broker-dealer designation for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management will remain &quot;Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC&quot;.

==History==

Smith Barney &amp; Co. was formed in 1938 through the merger of Charles D. Barney &amp; Co. and Edward B. Smith &amp; Co. Charles D. Barney &amp; Co., a New York and Philadelphia based firm, was founded by Charles D. Barney in 1873 following the failure of its predecessor Jay Cooke &amp; Company. Edward B. Smith &amp; Co., founded in 1892 became a significant player in securities underwriting in 1934 when the firm absorbed the professionals from the securities business of Guaranty Trust Company, following the passage of the Glass Steagall Act.

In 1975, Smith Barney merged with Harris, Upham &amp; Co. to form Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which, in 1977, was placed under SBHU Holdings, a holding company. In 1982, SBHU Holdings was renamed Smith Barney Inc. During the 1980s, the company was known for its television commercials featuring actor John Houseman, with the catchphrase, &quot;They make money the old-fashioned way. They &quot;earn&quot; it.&quot; After Houseman stepped down, the campaign continued with various actors, such as Leo McKern, Joel Higgins and George C. Scott.

In the late 1980s, the retail brokerage firm Smith Barney was owned by Sanford I. Weill&#x27;s Primerica Corporation. Commercial Credit purchased Primerica in 1988, for $1.5 billion ($ today). In 1992, they paid $722 million ($ today) to buy a 27% share of Travelers Insurance and in 1993 acquired Shearson (which included the legacy business of E.F. Hutton) from American Express. By the end of 1993, the merged company was known as Travelers Group Inc. although the brokerage business continued to operate under the Smith Barney brand.

In 1993, Weill bought stockbroker Shearson back from American Express for $1 billion ($ today), and merged it into Smith Barney. (Weill had been in charge of Shearson Loeb Rhoades and sold it to American Express in 1981.) 
Weill offered Joe Plumeri the presidency of Smith Barney, and he became the President of the merged company that year. He only lasted a year, as he experienced conflicts with existing Smith Barney managers.

In September 1997, Travelers acquired Salomon Inc. (parent company of Salomon Brothers Inc.), for over $9 billion ($ today) in stock, and merged it with its own investment arm to create Salomon Smith Barney. In April 1998 Travelers Group announced an agreement to undertake a $76 billion ($ today) merger between Travelers and Citicorp, creating Citigroup, which at the time of the merger was the largest single financial services company in the world. 

At the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, it was the largest tenant in 7 World Trade Center, occupying 1,202,900 sq ft (111,750 m2) (64 percent of the building) which included floors 28–45.

===Sale to Morgan Stanley===
During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Citigroup suffered large losses in its retained collateralized debt obligation exposure (loans that Citi underwrote but was not able to sell), and had to be rescued by the U.S. federal government. They decided to sell or close &quot;non-core&quot; businesses in order to raise money. On January 13, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup announced the merger of Smith Barney with Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Global Wealth Management Group, with Morgan Stanley paying $2.7 billion cash upfront to Citigroup for a 51% stake in the joint venture. The joint venture operates as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Morgan Stanley itself was in a financially cash-strapped position like Citigroup during that time, but they were helped by the $9 billion that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group had paid in 2008 for a 21% stake in Morgan Stanley.

On June 1, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup announced they closed early on the launch of their joint venture that combines Morgan Stanley&#x27;s wealth management unit (including many former Dean Witter assets) with Citi&#x27;s Smith Barney brokerage division. The new venture, called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was supposed to launch during the third quarter. The combined entity generates about $14 billion in net revenue, has 18,500 financial advisors, 1,000 locations worldwide and serves about 6.8 million households.

Citigroup disclosed on September 17, 2009, they would sell their remaining shares in the group to partner Morgan Stanley.

<text>Arif Mardin (March 15, 1932 – June 25, 2006) was a Turkish-American music producer, who worked with hundreds of artists across many different styles of music, including jazz, rock, soul, disco and country. He worked at Atlantic Records for over 30 years, as producer, arranger, studio manager, and vice president, before moving to EMI and serving as vice president and general manager of Manhattan Records.

Mardin worked with artists including the Rascals, Queen, Melissa Manchester, John Prine, the Bee Gees, Hall &amp; Oates, Anita Baker, Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack, Bette Midler, Michael Crawford, Chaka Khan, Howard Jones, Laura Nyro, Ringo Starr, Carly Simon, Phil Collins, Daniel Rodriguez, and Norah Jones. Mardin was awarded eleven Grammy Awards and has eighteen nominations.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Mardin was born in Istanbul into a renowned family that included statesmen, diplomats and leaders in the civic, military and business sectors of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic. His father was co-owner in a petroleum gas station chain.

Mardin grew up listening to the likes of Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller. Through his sister he met jazz critic Cuneyt Sermet, who turned him onto this music and eventually became his mentor. After graduating from Istanbul University in Economics and Commerce, Mardin studied at the London School of Economics. Influenced by his sister&#x27;s music records and jazz, he was also an accomplished orchestrator and arranger, but he never intended to pursue a career in music.

However, his fate changed in 1956 after meeting the American jazz musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones at a concert in Ankara. He sent three demo compositions to his friend Tahir Sur who worked at a radio station in the United States. Sur took these compositions to Quincy Jones and Mardin became the first recipient of the Quincy Jones Scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 1958 he and his fiancé Latife moved from Istanbul to Boston. After graduating in 1961, he taught at Berklee for one year and then moved to New York City to try his luck. Arif Mardin was later made a trustee of Berklee and was awarded an honorary doctorate.

===Career===

Mardin began his career at Atlantic Records in 1963 as an assistant to Nesuhi Ertegün. A fellow Turkish émigré, Nesuhi was the brother of Ahmet Ertegün, Atlantic&#x27;s co-founder and a jazz enthusiast when they met at the Newport Jazz Festival. Mardin rose through the ranks quickly, becoming studio manager, label house producer and arranger. In 1969, he became the Vice President and later served as Senior Vice President until 2001. He worked closely on many projects with co-founders Ertegün and Jerry Wexler, as well as noted recording engineer Tom Dowd; the three legends (Dowd, Mardin, and Wexler) were responsible for establishing the &quot;Atlantic Sound&quot;. Arif Mardin retired from Atlantic Records in May 2001 and re-activated his label Manhattan Records. He maintained ties to the Turkish music industry.

He produced many hit artists including Margie Joseph, Thereza Bazar, The Rascals, Carly Simon, Petula Clark, Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Cher, the Bee Gees, Diana Ross, Queen, Patti LaBelle, Aretha Franklin, Lulu, Anita Baker, Judy Collins, Phil Collins, Scritti Politti, Culture Club, Roberta Flack, Average White Band, Hall &amp; Oates, Donny Hathaway, Jeffrey Osborne, Howard Jones, Norah Jones, Daniel Rodriguez, Chaka Khan, George Benson, Melissa Manchester, The Manhattan Transfer, Modern Jazz Quartet, Willie Nelson, John Prine, Leo Sayer, Dusty Springfield, David Bowie, Jewel and Ringo Starr.

Mardin is listed on Stephen Stills&#x27; first album (1970) issued by Atlantic Records, as a contributing artist for string arrangement on the songs &quot;Church&quot; and &quot;To a Flame&quot;.

Arif Mardin, when producing the Bee Gees&#x27; 1975 &quot;Main Course&quot; album track &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot; discovered the distinctive falsetto of Barry Gibb, which became a familiar trademark of the band throughout the disco era.

Mardin made three solo albums: &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, in 1970, &quot;Journey&quot;, in 1975, and &quot;All My Friends Are Here&quot;, in 2006. In &quot;Journey&quot;, he was the composer and arranger, but he also played electric piano and percussion, and was accompanied by many stars of jazz (Randy and Michael Brecker, Joe Farrell, Gary Burton, Ron Carter, Steve Gadd, Billy Cobham and many others). Mardin composed, arranged, conducted and produced &quot;The Prophet&quot;, an interpretation of &quot;The Prophet&quot; by Kahlil Gibran, in 1974, featuring Richard Harris.

In his career of more than 40 years, he collected over 40 gold and platinum albums, over 15 Grammy nominations and 12 Grammy Awards. In 1990, Arif Mardin was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.

===&quot;All My Friends Are Here&quot;===
Mardin considered &quot;All My Friends Are Here&quot; his life&#x27;s work. He wrote or co-wrote all but one of the 13 tracks. The album features performances by Bette Midler, Chaka Khan, David Sanborn, Norah Jones, Carly Simon, Phil Collins, among the artists whom he produced over the years. Recording sessions and interviews were filmed for the companion documentary &quot;The Greatest Ears in Town: The Arif Mardin Story&quot;.

== The Greatest Ears in Town: The Arif Mardin Story ==
His son, Joe, created a documentary about his father called &quot;The Greatest Ears in Town: The Arif Mardin Story&quot; which was released on June 15, 2010. The documentary was directed by Doug Biro. It was premiered at several screenings at different chapters of The Recording Academy. The first screening took place in New York on June 15, 2010.

Mardin died at his home in New York on June 25, 2006, following a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer. His remains were brought to Turkey and were interred at Karacaahmet Cemetery in Üsküdar district of Istanbul on July 5, 2006. Bee Gees&#x27; soloist Robin Gibb and his wife Dwina attended the funeral service, among other prominent people.

Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the Turkish president, said in a statement: “I was deeply saddened by the death of Arif Mardin, who is considered to be one of the most important music producers of the 20th century. He will always be respectfully remembered as a person who made our nation proud.”

Ahmet Ertegun, Founder of Atlantic Records and former chairman of The American Turkish Society remarked  &quot;Arif Mardin has been one of the most prolific board members of The American Turkish Society and a great friend. We are deeply grateful for his service.&quot;

A memorial tribute to Mardin was held at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on March 6, 2007.

<text>Matthijs Hendrikszoon Quast (died 6 October 1641), anglicized as Matthys and Matthew Quast, was a Dutch merchant and explorer in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Quast made several voyages on the VOC&#x27;s behalf to Tokugawa Japan, the Qing Empire (China), and Ayutthaya Kingdom (&quot;Siam&quot;) but is primarily remembered for his failed 1639 expedition in search of the phantom islands of Rica de Oro and Rica de Plata previously reported by Spanish mariners. He is sometimes credited with the first recorded discovery of the Bonin Islands during the voyage, although the VOC did nothing with the information and they remained unimportant and sparsely settled until the 19th century.

==1639 Expedition==
Claims that southern or eastern seas held islands rich with gold and silver are at least as old as the ancient Greeks, who called them Chryse and Argyre. Spanish mariners had placed their and (&quot;Island Rich with Gold&quot; and &quot;with Silver&quot;) at various locations around the North Pacific for decades. Quast&#x27;s expedition was occasioned by a 7 December 1635 report from Willem Verstegen, a VOC trader at Dejima off Nagasaki, that seemed to verify the Spanish claims, placing &quot;Kinshima&quot; &quot;Island of Gold&quot;) and &quot;Ginshima&quot; &quot;Island of Silver&quot;) somewhere vaguely east of Honshu. (For his part, Verstegen specifically located the islands to be discovered at 37° 30′ N. somewhere within 400 mijls of the Japanese coast.) The VOC officials at the eastern headquarters of Batavia on Java in the Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia) were unimpressed and uninterested but were eventually overruled by the heeren back in the Netherlands, who ordered them to investigate.

Quast was instructed to go to the area matching the Spanish and Japanese accounts by way of the Philippines and then to continue northwest from there to explore Korea and the possibilities for a Northeast Passage around Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia (&quot;Tartary&quot;). The VOC reserving its good ships for trading voyages with certain profit upon completion, the expedition was given the two small and run-down ships (Dutch for &quot;Angel&quot;) and or (&quot;Urban Canal&quot;). Quast and his commander Lucas Albertsen used the &quot;Engel&quot; as the flagship while his lieutenant Abel Tasmannow famous for his later voyages to Australiacaptained the &quot;Gracht&quot;.

The expedition left Batavia on 2 June 1639. It passed Luzon into the open water of the Pacific on 10 July. Eager to find the two islands, Quast raised the bonus for the first person to sight land. Simultaneously, he more seriously penalized anyone found asleep on watch: fifty lashes and a fine of a month&#x27;s pay on the first offense, twice as much for the second, and death for the third. Systematically crossing the sea in the areas indicated, reaching as far as 42° N. and 177° E., the two ships discovered or rediscovered the entirely uninhabited Bonin Islands but found nothing even vaguely resembling what they were looking for. The crew decimated by illness exacerbated by poor rations and the ships beginning to fail, Quast finally abandoned his fruitless search on 25 October. Bad as things were, he directed his men to sail for Fort Zeelandia on Taiwan (now within Tainan&#x27;s Anping District) rather than attempting to continue northwest. By the time his men reached Tayouan and its fort on 24 November, 41 of the 90 men who had sailed with Quast had died.

==Legacy==

Uninhabited, remote, and without known resources or harbors, the Bonins were entirely ignored by the Dutch East India Company as they had been ignored by any Spanish before them, permitting their rediscovery and colonization by the Japanese in the next century. Quast&#x27;s expedition added some detail to Dutch charts of the southern coast of Japan but nothing vital or profitable; it long lingered in complete obscurity until Philipp Franz von Siebold rediscovered its logs after noticing charts of Dutch islands in the area of the rediscovered Bonins. The final leg of his mission which he had been unable to complete was given to Martin de Vries, whose expedition explored Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the southern Kurils in 1643.

<text>Kamāmalu Kalani-Kuaʻana-o-Kamehamalu-Kekūāiwa-o-kalani-Kealiʻi-Hoʻopili-a-Walu (–1824) was Queen consort of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi as the wife of King Kamehameha II. Kamāmalu was short for Kamehamalu or Kamehamehamalu meaning &quot;the Shade of the Lonely One&quot;, honoring her father, &quot;the Lonely One&quot;. She is not to be confused with her niece, Princess Victoria Kamāmalu.

== Life ==
She was the eldest daughter of Queen Kalākua Kaheiheimālie and King Kamehameha I. She was referred to as Kekūāiwa for the early part of her life.
According to John Papa ʻĪʻī, she was betrothed to her half-brother Kamehameha II from birth and they were married when she was twelve and he was seventeen or eighteen.
Her younger sister Kīnaʻu later also became wife of Kamehameha II as did their half-sister Kekauluohi by their mothers Kalakua Kaheiheimalie. Even though her husband had four other wives (two of them her sisters and the two others her nieces), Kamāmalu was her husband&#x27;s favorite wife.

In 1823, she joined a royal procession honoring her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne in a car modeled as a whaleboat. It was fastened to a platform long by wide and borne by 70 men. The boat was lined and the whole platform covered with fine imported broadcloth and tapa cloth of rich colors. The only dress of the queen was a scarlet silk &quot;paʻū&quot;, and a coronet of feathers. She was seated in the middle of the boat, and screened from the sun by an immense Chinese umbrella of scarlet damask, ornamented with gilding and tassels, supported by a chief standing behind her in a scarlet loincloth and feather helmet. On the boat stood Prime Minister Kalanimoku and national orator Naihe in feathered helmets and bearing a &quot;kahili&quot; or feather staff of state.

Queen Kamāmalu had a tattoo applied to her tongue as an expression of her deep grief when her mother-in-law Queen Keōpūolani died in 1823. Missionary William Ellis watched the procedure, commenting to the queen that she must be undergoing great pain. The queen replied, &quot;He eha nui no, he nui roa ra ku‘u aroha.&quot; (Great pain indeed, greater is my affection.)
In 1823, Kamehameha II and Kamāmalu left the Sandwich Islands for London, arriving there in May 1824 for a state visit with King George IV. In London the royal party were fitted with the latest fashion and attended opera and ballet at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.
Many ladies of London sought the patterns of the turban that adorned her head. She attracted attention because she stood over six feet tall and was strikingly beautiful. She and her husband were the first Hawaiian monarchs to visit England. While in London, Kamāmalu contracted measles and died on July 8.
Six days later her grief-stricken husband also died of the measles. Their bodies were placed in coffins and taken back to Hawaii on . At first they were buried in a coral house on the grounds of the ʻIolani Palace, but were later moved to the Royal Mausoleum in Nuʻuanu Valley of Oʻahu island.

<text>Jean-Christophe &quot;Pitof&quot; Comar is a French visual effects supervisor and director notable for &quot;Vidocq&quot; and &quot;Catwoman&quot;.

== Career ==
Pitof began his career in the film industry in 1976 as an assistant director, still photographer and film editor. He then branched out into musical scoring, software design and graphic design for televisions, music videos and commercials. Co-founder of Duran Duboi, a digital postproduction company, Pitof worked on commercials, videos and feature films.

In 1997, Pitof took on the role of second unit director for Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s &quot;Alien: Resurrection.&quot; It was Pitof’s third collaboration with Jeunet after working together on the Jeunet-Caro films &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;.

in 2000 Pitof made his directorial debut with the film, &quot;Vidocq&quot; a period thriller starring Gerard Depardieu and Guillaume Canet, premiered in France in September 2001.
It is notable as being the first major fantasy film to be released (one year before &quot;Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones&quot;) was shot entirely with digital cinematography, using a Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta camera.

In 2004, Pitof made his English-language debut with the Hollywood film &quot;Catwoman&quot;, starring Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. The film was critically panned, and is considered one of the worst movies of all time. Pitof was awarded the Razzie Award for Worst Director for the film. In 2024 Pitof openly explained the many issues behind &quot;Catwoman&quot; and the exclusion of the Batman character.

Pitof was set to direct the US-Chinese co-production &quot;Empires of the Deep&quot; although he eventually dropped out.

In 2019 Pitof co-founded 6th Sense VR, a company developing, producing and distributing VR content.

<text>Zabriskie Point is a soundtrack album to the Michelangelo Antonioni film of the same name. It was originally released April 11, 1970 in the US and May 29, 1970 in the UK and features songs recorded by contemporary rock acts of Antonioni&#x27;s choosing, including Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, and the Kaleidoscope.

A 1997 re-release includes four bonus tracks each from Jerry Garcia and Pink Floyd that were used in the film, but not the original soundtrack. Jim Morrison of The Doors wrote the track &quot;L&#x27;America&quot; for the film, but was rejected by Antonioni (&quot;L&#x27;America&quot; was later released on The Doors&#x27; album &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;). A Rolling Stones track, &quot;You Got the Silver&quot;, is featured in the film but not included on this album.

==Pink Floyd==
Pink Floyd&#x27;s contributions to the album were recorded in November and December 1969, after the release of &quot;Ummagumma&quot;. &quot;Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up&quot; is a re-recording of &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot;, originally released as a B-side in December 1968. &quot;Love Scene (Version 4)&quot; is a Rick Wright solo piano composition. &quot;Country Song&quot; (also known as &quot;The Red Queen&quot;) is a ballad filled with chess metaphors. &quot;Unknown Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Rain in the Country&quot;) is a relaxed instrumental. &quot;Love Scene (Version 6)&quot; (also known as &quot;Alan&#x27;s Blues&quot;) is a bluesy instrumental. A track entitled &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot; and another called &quot;Oenone&quot; were recorded but did not appear on the finished album.

Pink Floyd also recorded other unreleased material during the same sessions. Most notable is a lengthy composition which at that time was known as &quot;The Violent Sequence&quot; (later released on Dark Side of the Moon Immersion Box Set). This was later reworked, as &quot;Us and Them&quot; from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. An additional number of tracks of previously unreleased studio work from these sessions have been released in 2016 on &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot; (Volume 4: 1970: Devi/ation).

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau has said the soundtrack album is &quot;considerably deeper and more coherent&quot; than the film. AllMusic&#x27;s Steven McDonald later called it &quot;an odd melange of songs&quot; but also &quot;well worth hearing&quot; for the Pink Floyd recordings.

<text>The Chechahcos is a 1924 American silent adventure drama film about the gold rush days in the Klondike. &quot;Chechahco&quot;, more commonly spelled &quot;cheechako&quot;, is a Chinook Jargon word for &quot;newcomer&quot;, and the film focuses on a group of would-be prospectors sailing for Alaska. The film was directed by Lewis H. Moomaw and produced by Austin E. Lathrop, who himself was once a prospector. The film was distributed by Associated Exhibitors. The film was the first shot on location in Alaska.

==Plot==

A ship headed towards the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s catches on fire and all onboard must abandon ship. Passenger Margaret Stanlaw (Eva Gordon) loses her young daughter Ruth (Baby Margie) in the ensuing panic, and is informed by shady gambler Richard Steele (Alexis B. Luce) that she did not survive. In actuality, Ruth is saved by prospective prospectors “Horseshoe” Riley and Bob Dexter (William Dills and Albert Van Altwerp). This new makeshift family arrives in Anchorage and almost immediately strikes gold. 15 years later Ruth is now a young adult (Gladys Johnson), who is having an inexplicable attraction to Dexter, the man who helped raise her and is essentially her father. When Margaret and Richard come into town to run the local saloon, secrets will be revealed, pasts will be confronted, and the Alaskan terrain will be filmed for the first time.

==Cast==
* William Dills as &#x27;Horseshoe&#x27; Riley
* Albert Van Antwerp as Engineer Bob Dexter

<text>The Rose Education Foundation is a U.S.-based non-profit educational organization that seeks to provide high quality educational opportunities for children in Guatemala. The Rose Foundation works with Brigham Young University and Universidad Galileo to provide teacher training programs every summer in Guatemala City.

The mission of the Rose Foundation is to promote, support, and establish educational opportunities for children in disadvantaged areas of Guatemala. The foundation also seeks to strengthen individuals and families by encouraging and teaching valuable life skills, by developing honorable citizens and leaders, and by promoting educational excellence.

== History ==

The first Rose school began operations in 1997 through the financial support of founder Nedra Roney. Since that time, Roney has given the foundation a grant that provides for the entire current operating budget of the foundation. This grant allows 100% of donor contributions to be used exclusively for educating the students. In the beginning, there was one small school in Patzicia. In 1997, that school served approximately 50 children.

Two other schools have since been organized, one in Chimaltenango and the other in Momostenango. In addition to these schools, the Rose Foundation supports several other schools with training, administrative, and volunteer support. These schools have a combined enrollment of over 1,500 students. In November 1999, the foundation received recognition from the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public non-profit organization.

The Rose Education Foundation offices in Guatemala are located in Chimaltenango. Offices in the US are located in Provo, Utah.

<doc id="789971" wikidata="Q7934683" url="?curid=789971" title="Virginia dynasty">
<text>The Virginia dynasty is a term sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five presidents of the United States were from Virginia. The term sometimes excludes George Washington, who, though a Virginia planter, was closely aligned with the policies of the Federalist Party, and was succeeded by his vice president, John Adams of Massachusetts. The first five presidents were, in order, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe.

The defeat of Adams in 1800 by his vice president, Thomas Jefferson, who had previously served as Washington&#x27;s secretary of state, marked the true beginning of the Virginia dynasty, which is usually associated with what is now called the Democratic-Republican Party, although it was generally referred to as simply the &quot;Republican,&quot; &quot;Democratic,&quot; or &quot;Jeffersonian&quot; Party at the time. Jefferson served two terms before retiring, in the Washingtonian precedent, in favor of his secretary of state, fellow Virginian James Madison, called the &quot;Father of the Constitution.&quot; Although the War of 1812 greatly weakened Madison&#x27;s popularity in the Northeast, especially in New England which consequently discussed secession, he was nonetheless re-elected rather easily in 1812 and was able to assist another Virginian who had remained loyal to him and the party, James Monroe, to be elected president in 1816.

By the end of Monroe&#x27;s first term the Federalist Party had essentially disbanded and Monroe was re-elected in 1820 without any real opposition, receiving every electoral vote except one, which went for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams. Much later a myth arose that the dissenting elector had done so in order that George Washington would be the only president in American history to be elected unanimously.

Monroe&#x27;s second term marked the end of the Virginia dynasty. In the election of 1824, supporters of Virginia-born Georgia politician William H. Crawford portrayed him as &quot;the rightful and legitimate successor of the Virginia Dynasty,&quot; but the Democratic-Republican Party splintered. John Quincy Adams won the disputed 1824 election over General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, then considered to be part of the Southwest.

After Virginia contributed four of the first five presidents, who held office for 32 of the first 36 years under the Constitution, four other natives of Virginia have so far served as president. They were William Henry Harrison, Virginia-born but elected as a resident of Ohio; John Tyler, who was elected vice president in 1840 as Harrison&#x27;s running mate, but wound up serving all but the first month of the latter&#x27;s term after Harrison became the first president to die in office; Zachary Taylor, who made his name as a Kentucky resident and resided in Louisiana at the time of his election; and Woodrow Wilson, who was a Virginia native but became the nation&#x27;s chief executive after serving as president of Princeton University and governor of New Jersey.

<doc id="789973" wikidata="Q42417097" url="?curid=789973" title="Independent contracting in the United States">
<text>An independent contractor is a person, business, or corporation that provides goods or services under a written contract or a verbal agreement. Unlike employees, independent contractors do not work regularly for an employer but work as required, when they may be subject to law of agency. Independent contractors are usually paid on a freelance basis. Contractors often work through a limited company or franchise, which they themselves own, or may work through an umbrella company.

In the United States, any company or organization engaged in a trade or business that pays more than $600 to an independent contractor in one year is required to report this to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as well as to the contractor, using Form 1099-NEC. This form includes the money paid, contractor&#x27;s name, social security number, address, phone number, and an indicator about the existence of foreign bank accounts; independent contractors do not have income taxes withheld like employees. The form has also led to use of the phrase &quot;1099 workers&quot; or &quot;the 1099 economy&quot; to refer to the independent contractors themselves.

==Versus employee ==

The distinction between independent contractor and employee is an important one in the United States, as the costs for business owners to maintain employees are significantly higher than the costs associated with hiring independent contractors, due to federal and state requirements for employers to pay FICA (Social Security and Medicare taxes) and unemployment taxes on received income for employees. Likewise, employees are protected from being fired without cause, and if fired or let go for other reasons are entitled to unemployment benefits, whereas independent contractors have neither protection nor entitlement. Employees are also entitled to receive overtime pay for work performed over the 40-hour-per-week standard, whereas independent contractors may work any number of hours (including far above this standard) with no change in pay.

In the early 1990s, the IRS methodically began to look for employers who were misclassifying employees as independent contractors, and has since obtained billions of dollars in Social Security back taxes. Recently, worker classification initiatives have been a top priority for the IRS, the Department of Labor, and state agencies. In 2011, the IRS and the Department of Labor entered into a memorandum of understanding in an effort to jointly increase worker misclassification audits.

The United States Supreme Court has offered the following guidelines to distinguish employees from independent contractors:

The IRS, for federal income tax, applies a &quot;right to control test&quot; which considers the nature of the working relationship. They highlight three general aspects of the employment arrangement:

#financial control 
#behavioral control
#relationship between the parties

In general, their criteria parallel those of the Supreme Court in sentiment. They include guidelines such as the amount of instruction, training, integration, use of assistants, length of professional relationship, regularity of work, location of work, payment schedule, source of funds for business expenditures, right to quit, and financial risk more typically seen with each work category. In their framework, independent contractors retain control over schedule and hours worked, jobs accepted, and performance monitoring. They also can have a major investment in equipment, furnish their own supplies, provide their own insurance, repairs, and other expenses related to their business. They may also perform a unique service that is not in the normal course of business of the employer. This contrasts with employees, who usually work at the schedule required by the employer, and whose performance the employer directly supervises. Independent contractors can also work for multiple firms, and offer their services to the general public.

The distinction between independent contractors and employees is not always clear, and continues to evolve. For example, some independent contractors may work for a number of different organizations throughout the year, while others retain independent contractor status although they work for the same organization the entire year. Other companies, for example in the freight transport industry, specify the schedule for the independent contractor, require purchase of vehicles from the company and prohibit work for other companies.

In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor issued new guidelines on the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. &quot;A worker who is economically dependent on an employer is suffered or permitted to work by the employer. Thus, applying the economic realities test in view of the expansive definition of &quot;employ&quot; under the Act, most workers are employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act.&quot;

==Specific occupations==
Examples of occupations where independent contractor arrangements are typical:
== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Independent contracting has both benefits and drawbacks to contractors.

===Advantages===
* Since they are rarely tied to an employer, they are free to set their own rules of business, limited only by bargaining power.
* Since they usually develop a large network of clients, the loss of one or two often has a negligible effect.
* Many people simply like the idea of &quot;being your own boss.&quot; Aside from materialistic benefits, many people simply enjoy not having to answer to a supervisor.
* As an artist/author of any tangible artwork, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, or written works, a person is entitled to exclusive copyright ownership if they created the work as an independent contractor. If the person created such works while in the employ of another person or corporation, the rights belong to the employer (under most standard employment contracts).

Firms in the sharing economy such as Uber can gain substantial advantages via the misclassification of employees as independent contractors.

===Disadvantages===
* In the United States, an Internal Revenue Service computer algorithm matches individuals with Form 1099s to the company that pays them. If an independent contractor reports more than $10,000 of earnings, or majority of income from a single source, the IRS is likely to question the independence of the worker, and investigate the company that issued the Form 1099. 
* Employer misclassification of employees as independent contractors either inadvertently or to avoid taxation and regulation, is widespread. Additionally, contractorization has been used as an indirect form of union-busting.
* An independent contractor can itself be a business with employees; however, in most cases in the United States independent contractors operate as a sole proprietorship or single-member limited liability company. This means the independent contractor, as a business owner, incurs its own expenses to provide the contracted service, must acquire its own equipment to perform the service, and is responsible for business filings such as income tax returns.
* Independent contractors are responsible for their own self-employment tax, which consists of both halves of the FICA tax amount. An employee only pays the employee portion of the FICA tax. Self-employment taxes are not withheld from the earnings of independent contractors who are required to voluntarily declare and pay estimated earnings taxes to the IRS, which can lead to a trap for contractors who run into financial difficulty and become tempted to put off making the required estimated tax payments.
* There are several monetary incentives that are guaranteed to employees in the United States, but not independent contractors. Examples include worker&#x27;s compensation and unemployment insurance; but independent contractors are allowed to make Individual Retirement Account contributions.
* In many jurisdictions, occupational safety and health regulations are less comprehensive for independent contractors.

==Independent contracting in tort==
The employer of an independent contractor is generally not held vicariously liable for the tortious acts and omissions of the contractor, because the control and supervision found in an employer–employee or principal–agent relationship is lacking. However, vicarious liability will be imposed in some circumstances:
#where the contractor injures an invitee to the real property of the employer, 
#the contractor is involved in an ultra-hazardous activity (one likely to cause substantial injury, such as blasting with explosives), or
#the employer is estopped from denying liability because he has held out the independent contractor as if he were simply an employee or agent.
#the employer is involved in an operation subject to obligations imposed by a public authority

==Alternatives==
Due to the higher expense of maintaining employees, many employers needing to transition from independent contractors to employees may find the switch difficult. There is a transitional status for employees as an alternative to independent contracting known as being a statutory employee. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than classic employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment tax. But they are more expensive than independent contractors because Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid on wages. Similarly to independent contractors, statutory employees can deduct their trade or business expenses from their W2 earnings.

===Dependent contractor===
A growing number of workers do not neatly fit the government&#x27;s categorizations of independent contractors and statutory employees, and are increasingly being classified as dependent contractors. Some of these contingent workforce—independent contractors, temporary workers, and part-time workers, who work when and for how long they want, such as those who work for such companies as Uber, Handybook, Inc., and CrowdFlower—have filed lawsuits that argue that companies that substantially control workers&#x27; work and behaviors while working (such as at Handybook, Inc.: when to knock on customers&#x27; doors vs. ring the doorbells, and how to use the customers&#x27; bathrooms) should be covered by minimum-wage and overtime rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as receive other traditional employee protections. Wilma Liebman, former chairperson of the National Labor Relations Board, has observed that Canada and Germany have such protections in place for contingent workers. And UK Prime Minister David Cameron has appointed an overseer for freelance workers in that country, to determine how the government should support freelance workers.

<text>A composite bow is a traditional bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, a form of laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the outer side of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made similar to that of all-wood &quot;self&quot; bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, making a composite bow requires more varieties of material than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.

Archaeological finds and art indicate composite bows have existed since the second millennium BCE, but their history is not well recorded, being developed by cultures without a written tradition. They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities, classically for mounted archery, although they can also be used on foot. Such bows spread among the military (and hunters) of civilizations that came into contact with nomad tribes; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa, and southwards in the Arabian Peninsula and in India. The use of horn in a bow was even remarked on in Homer&#x27;s epic &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, believed to have been written in the 8th century BCE.

The details of manufacture varied between the various cultures that used them. Initially, the tips of the limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as &quot;siyahs&quot;, which are made as an integral part of the wooden core of the bow.

Like other bows, they lost importance with the introduction and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas, composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Early modern Turkish bows were specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass bellies and backs with a natural or man-made core.

==Construction and materials==
The wooden core gives the bow its shape and dimensional stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, and the use of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.

The wood of the bending part of the limb (&quot;dustar&quot;) must endure intense shearing stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and wood of the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips (&quot;siyahs&quot;), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.

A thin layer of horn is glued onto what will be the belly of the bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon delaminate with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.

The sinew, soaked in animal glue, is then laid in layers on the back of the bow; the strands of sinew are oriented along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew has greater elastic tension properties than wood, again increasing the amount of energy that can be stored in the bow stave.

Hide glue or gelatin made from fish gas bladders is used to attach layers of sinew to the back of the bow, and to attach the horn belly to the wooden core.

Stiffening laths, if used, are attached. Both horn and laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying, the bow is ready for use. Further finishing may include thin leather or waterproof bark, to protect the bow from moisture, and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and gold leaf.

Strings and arrows are essential parts of the weapon system, but no type of either is specifically associated with composite bows throughout their history.

==Advantages and disadvantages of composite construction==

===Advantages===
The main advantage of composite bows over self bows (made from a single piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight in the early stages of the archer&#x27;s draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length, and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.

For most practical non-mounted archery purposes, composite construction offers no advantage; &quot;the initial velocity is about the same for all types of bow... within certain limits, the design parameters... appear to be less important than is often claimed.&quot; However, they are superior for horsemen and in the specialized art of flight archery: &quot;A combination of many technical factors made the composite flight bow better for flight shooting.&quot; The higher arrow velocity is only for well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight. At the weights more usual for modern amateurs, the greater density of horn and sinew compared with wood usually cancels any advantage.

===Disadvantages===
Constructing composite bows requires much more time and a greater variety of materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the &quot;Strategikon&quot;, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week&#x27;s work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self bows, while those living in temperate, dry, or arid regions have favoured composite bows. 

Medieval Europeans favoured self bows as hand bows, but they made composite prods for crossbows. The prods were usually well protected from rain and humidity, which are prevalent in parts of Europe. Ancient Mediterranean civilizations, influenced by Eastern Archery, preferred composite recurve bows, and the Romans manufactured and used them as far north as Britannia.

The civilizations of India used both self bows and composite bows. The Mughals were especially known for their composite bows due to their Turko-Mongol roots. Waterproofing and proper storage of composite bows were essential due to India&#x27;s extremely wet and humid subtropical climate and plentiful rainfall today (which averages in most of the country, and exceeds well over per year in the wettest areas due to monsoons).

The civilizations of China also used a combination of self bows, composite recurve bows, and laminated reflex bows. Self bows and laminated bows were preferred in southern China in earlier periods of history due to the region&#x27;s extremely wet, humid, and rainy subtropical climate. The average rainfall in southern China exceeds , averaging in many areas today.

==Origins and use==

Composite construction may have become common in the third or fourth millennium BCE, in Mesopotamia and Elam (South-West Iran).

===Associated with charioteers===
Bows of any kind seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian laminated bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records of any kind are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; there is no indication that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.
Composite bows were soon adopted and adapted by civilizations who came into contact with nomads, such as the Chinese, Assyrians, and Egyptians. Several composite bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang dynasty (1600–1100 BCE). There are strong indications that Greek Bronze Age cultures were using composite bows on a large scale. By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia, where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).

===By mounted archers===

The mounted archer became the archetypal warrior of the steppes and the composite bow was his primary weapon, used to protect the herds, in steppe warfare, and for incursions into settled lands.

Classic tactics for horse-mounted archers included skirmishing: they would approach, shoot, and retreat before any effective response could be made. The term Parthian shot refers to the widespread horse-archer tactic of shooting backwards over the rear of their horses as they retreated. Parthians inflicted heavy defeats on Romans, the first being the Battle of Carrhae. However, horse archers did not make an army invincible; Han General Ban Chao led successful military expeditions in the late 1st century CE that conquered as far as Central Asia, and both Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great defeated horse archer armies. Well-led Roman armies defeated Parthian armies on several occasions and twice took the Parthian capital.

===By infantry===
Composite bows can be used without difficulty by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571, archers with composite bows were a main component of the forces of the Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year, they lost most of these troops and never replaced them.

==Technical changes in classical times==
The details of bow construction changed somewhat with time. It is not clear that the various developments of the composite bow led to measurable improvements: &quot;the development of archery equipment may not be a process involving progressive improvements in performance. Rather, each design type represents one solution to the problem of creating a mobile weapon system capable of hurling lightweight projectiles.&quot;

===Scythian bows, bending tips===

 Variants of the Scythian bow were the dominant form in Asia until approximately the first century BCE. These were short weapons—one was long when strung, with arrows perhaps long—with flexible, &quot;working&quot; tips; the wooden core was continuous from the centre to the tip.

===Siyahs, stiff tips===
From about the 4th century BCE, the use of stiffened ends on composite bows became widespread. The stiffened end of the bow is a &quot;siyah&quot; (Arabic, Persian), &quot;szarv&quot; (Hungarian), &quot;sarvi&quot; (Finnish; both &#x27;sarvi&#x27; and &#x27;szarv&#x27; mean &#x27;horn&#x27;) or &quot;kasan&quot; (Turkish); the bending section is a &quot;dustar&quot; (Arabic), &quot;lapa&quot; (Finnish) or &quot;sal&quot; (Turkish). For centuries, the stiffening was accomplished by attaching laths of bone or antler to the sides of the bow at its ends. The bone or antler strips are more likely to survive burial than the rest of the bow. The first bone strips suitable for this purpose come from &quot;graves of the fourth or third centuries&quot; BCE. These stiffeners are found associated with nomads of the time. Maenchen-Helfen states that they are not found in Achaemenid Persia, in early Imperial Rome, or in Han China. However, Coulston attributes Roman stiffeners to about or before 9 CE. He identifies a Steppe Tradition of Scythian bows with working tips, which lasted, in Europe, until the arrival of the Huns, and a Near East or Levantine tradition with siyahs, possibly introduced by the Parni as siyahs are found in Sassanid but not Achaemenid contexts. Siyahs have also been described on the Arabian peninsula. Composite bows were adopted by the Roman Empire and were made even in the cold and damp of Britannia. They were the normal weapon of later Roman archers, both infantry and cavalry units (although Vegetius recommends training recruits &quot;arcubus ligneis&quot;, with wooden bows).

===Laths stiffening the grip===
A new bow type, in which bone reinforcements cover the handle of the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” &quot;Hunnic&quot;, or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the &#x27;Qum-Darya Bow&#x27; from the Han Chinese-type site at the frontier post of Loulan, at the mouth of the Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.

With the arrival of the Huns, this tradition of bows with stiffened grips came to Europe. &quot;Alanic graves in the Volga region dating to the 3rd to 4th century CE signal the adoption of the Qum-Darya type by Sarmatian peoples from Hunnic groups advancing from the East. In general, Hunnic/Qum-Darya bows had two pairs of ear laths identical in every respect to those found on Roman limes sites. The ear laths show only a greater proportion of longer laths (like those of Roman examples from Bar Hill and London). More distinctively, the grip of the bow was stiffened by three laths. On the sides were glued a pair of trapezoidal laths with their longest edges towards the back. On the belly was glued a third lath, varying in shape but often narrow with parallel sides and splayed ends. Therefore, each bow possessed seven grip and ear laths, compared with none on the Scythian and Sarmatian bows and four (ear) laths on the Yrzi bow.&quot;

Such bows were often asymmetric, with lower limbs shorter than the upper.

The Huns and their successors greatly impressed their neighbours with their archery. Germanic tribes transmitted their respect orally for a millennium: in the Scandinavian Hervarar saga, the Geatish king Gizur taunts the Huns and says, &quot;Eigi gera Húnar oss felmtraða né hornbogar yðrir.&quot; (We fear neither the Huns nor their horn bows.) The Romans, as described in the Strategikon, Procopius&#x27;s histories, and other works, changed the entire emphasis of their army from heavy infantry to cavalry, many of them armed with bows. Maurikios&#x27;s Strategikon describes the Byzantine cavalry as bow-armed &quot;cursores&quot; and lance-armed &quot;defensores&quot;.

===Additional stiffening laths===
The Qum-Darya bow was superseded in the modern area of Hungary by an &#x27;Avar&#x27; type, with more and differently-shaped laths. The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued to the back of the handle, enclosing it with bone on all four faces. The belly lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional laths were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah, thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with a stiff, set-back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of . When unstrung, the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50-60 degrees.

==Post-classical development==
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, armies of the Byzantine Empire maintained their tradition of horse archery for centuries. Byzantium finally fell to the Turks before the decline of military archery in favour of guns. Turkish armies included archers until about 1591 (they played a major role in the Battle of Lepanto (1571), and flight archery remained a popular sport in Istanbul until the early 19th century. Most surviving documentation of the use and construction of composite bows comes from China and the Middle East; until reforms early in the 20th century, skill with the composite bow was an essential part of the qualification for officers in the Chinese Imperial army. 
The composite bow was adopted throughout the Arab world, even though some Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes, the protective cover on the back was painted with Arabic calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria.

The first surviving treatise on composite bow construction and archery was written in Arabic under Mamluk rule about 1368. Fragments of bone laths from composite bows were found among grave goods in the United Arab Emirates dating from the period between 100 BCE and 150 CE.

===Integral wooden siyahs===
Later developments in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splice to the wooden core of the bow, rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Medieval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening laths.

===String bridges===
A string &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;run&quot; is an attachment of horn or wood, used to hold the string a little further apart from the bow&#x27;s limbs at the base of the siyahs, as well as allowing the siyah to rest at an angle forward of the string. This attachment may add weight, but might give a small increase in the speed of the arrow by increasing the initial string angle and therefore the force of the draw in its early stages. Large string bridges are characteristic of Manchu (Qing dynasty, 1644–1911) bows and late Mongolian bows, while small string bridges are characteristic of Korean, Crimean Tatar, and some Ming dynasty (1368–1644) bows. String bridges are not present in artwork in the time of Genghis Khan or before.

==Modern living traditions==
All Eurasian composite bows derive from the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the basic design. The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting.

===Perso-Parthian bow===
The Perso-Parthian bow is a symmetric recurve under high tension when strung. The &quot;arms&quot; of the bow are supposed to reflex far enough to cross each other when the bow is unstrung. The finished bow is covered by bark, fine leather, or in some cases shark skin to keep out moisture.

Perso-Parthian bows were in use as late as the 1820s in Persia (ancient Iran). They were then replaced by muskets.

===Turkish bow===

This is the Ottoman development of the composite bow, presumably brought from the steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into probably the best traditional flight bows. Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold.

===Chinese bow===
For millennia, archery has played a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the cultures associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only a few Chinese traditional bow and arrow-making workshops were active. However, in the beginning of the 21st century, there has been a revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.

===Mongol bow===

The Mongolian tradition of archery is attested by an inscription on a stone stele that was found near Nerchinsk in Siberia: &quot;While Genghis Khan was holding an assembly of Mongolian dignitaries, after his conquest of Sartaul (Khwarezm), Yesüngge (the son of Genghis Khan&#x27;s younger brother) shot a target at 335 alds (536 m)&quot;. The Mongol bowmaking tradition was lost under the Qing, who heavily restricted archery practice; only practice with blunt arrows at shorted distances was allowed while most other forms of practice, including mounted archery; was forbidden. The present bowmaking tradition emerged after independence in 1921 and is based on Manchu types of bow. Mounted archery had fallen into disuse and has been revived only in the 21st century.

Archery with composite bows is part of the annual festival of the three virile sports (wrestling, horseriding, archery), called &quot;Naadam&quot;.

===Hungarian bow===
The Hungarian bow is a fairly long, approximately symmetrical composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its shape is known from two graves in which the position of the bone plates could be reconstructed. Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of their ancestors and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.

===Korean bow===

A traditional Korean bow, or gakgung, is a small but very efficient horn-bamboo-sinew composite bow. Korean archers normally practice at a range of approximately 145 metres.

===Japanese bow===

Yumi is made by laminating multiple pieces of bamboo and wood.

==Analogous New World bows, modern replicas, alternative materials==

===American sinew-backed bows===
When Europeans first contacted Native Americans, some bows, especially in the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the introduction of domesticated horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew does not seem to be recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.

===Replicas made with modern materials===
Modern replicas of traditional composite bows are commercially available; they are usually made with fibreglass or carbon on both belly and back, easier to mass-produce and easier to take care of than traditional composite bows.

Other less satisfactory materials than horn have been used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, have been used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).

<text>Kalama Hakaleleponi Kapakuhaili (1817 – September 20, 1870) was a Queen consort of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi alongside her husband, Kauikeaouli, who reigned as King Kamehameha III. She chose the baptismal name Hakaleleponi after the Biblical figure Hazzelelponi. Her name Kalama means &quot;the torch&quot; in the Hawaiian language.

== Early life ==
She was the only child of Kona chief Naihekukui, who was commander of the native Hawaiian fleet at Honolulu. Her mother was Chiefess Iʻahuʻula, the younger sister of Charles Kanaʻina. Kanaʻina would become &quot;hānai&quot; (Hawaiian form of adoption) parent of the child.

== Marriage ==
The young Kamehameha III, the boy king at the time, was needing a suitable royal bride. Many of the traditional chiefs wanted a union between the king and his sister Nāhienaena, as had been customary in the Hawaiian court since its beginning; however, the Christian missionaries and chiefs, who held significant political power, opposed this suggestion, calling it incest.

Kamanele, the daughter of Governor John Adams Kuakini, was proposed as the most suitable in age, rank, and education. However, she also died young. The young king fell in love with Kalama in 1832. This angered his sister Kīnaʻu and many of the high chiefs. Kamehameha III married her on February 14, 1837. This was only a few months after Nahienaena&#x27;s death.

== Children ==

Kalama and Kamehameha III had two children who died in their infancy. Both were named Keaweaweulaokalani, after their father.

She and Kamehameha III would later &quot;hānai&quot; (adopt) their nephew Alexander Liholiho, who later became Kamehameha IV. She also adopted Kaʻiminaʻauao, the daughter of Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea as her own. She even adopted her husband&#x27;s son Albert Kukaʻilimoku Kunuiakea by Jane Lahilahi Young.

== Later life ==

She would outlive both her husband Kamehameha III and her nephew Kamehameha IV, becoming known as the Queen dowager of Hawaii. She met Prince Alfred on his visit to Hawaii in the reign of Kamehameha V. She drove out to Waikīkī in her own carriage of state, accompanied by her adopted son, Kunuiakea, and Miriam Likelike. The drivers of these carriages wore the royal feather shoulder capes, and the footmen were clad in like royal fashion. It was considered one of the grandest occasions in the history of those days.
Kalama skillfully managed her properties and at the time of her death, she owned over 22,000 acres on the windward side of the island of Oahu.
She died intestate, and thus, her uncle Charles Kanaina was declared as the heir to her vast lands and properties.

She died on September 20, 1870, in Honolulu at the age of 53. On September 21, American marines had to be landed to place the American flag at half-mast, when the American consul at Honolulu would not assume responsibility for doing so, owing to a past instance where the Queen&#x27;s death was falsely reported.

== Namesakes ==
*Hakaleleponi Gate, an entrance for servants and attendants in ʻIolani Palace, is named after her.
*In 1925, Harold K.L. Castle developed Kailua&#x27;s first housing tract and named it Kalama after the Queen, who previously had owned the land in the Kailua area.
*Kalama Beach Park, the former Boettcher Estate, became a municipal park in 1978 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

<text>A Summer Dress () is a 1996 short film directed by François Ozon about a flagging gay relationship that is refueled in an unexpected way.

==Plot==
Luc (Frédéric Mangenot) spends his holiday by the sea with his slightly older and decidedly more effeminate boyfriend, Sébastien (Sébastien Charles). At the house they have rented, Sébastien&#x27;s flamboyant dancing and preening frustrates Luc, who rebukes him that the neighbors might see. Irritated, Luc goes off on his bicycle to the beach, hoping to find some solitude.

On the beach, Luc is finally alone and goes skinny dipping. Afterwards, he sunbathes in the nude and meets Lucia (Lucia Sanchez), a Spanish tourist about his age, who, after some flirtatious conversation, invites Luc to accompany her into the nearby wood for a tryst. Luc, though somewhat bashful, obliges with little hesitation. After having sex, Lucia learns that Luc is erotically involved with Sébastien and has never been with a woman before. She asks if he’s gay, and he replies no, he and Sébastien are just friends who sometimes fool around, implying that he’s unsure of his sexuality.

The two return to the beach to find that Luc&#x27;s clothes have been stolen. Lucia lends Luc her summer dress so that he won&#x27;t have to return home completely naked. Wearing a woman&#x27;s dress improves Luc&#x27;s mood as a car honks its horn after him on the ride back. He returns to the cabin with a smile and a renewed sense of freedom. Luc surprises Sébastien when he comes in. After a few amused remarks about the dress (Luc flirtatiously refers to himself as a &quot;beautiful girl&quot;), the two have passionate sex in the kitchen. The dress is partially torn in the act.

The next day, Luc mends the summer dress and brings it back to Lucia, who is just leaving. However, she refuses to accept it, coyly suggesting that it may come in handy in the future. She kisses Luc goodbye. The final frame shows Luc watching her leave, the dress wrapped around his neck and fluttering in the sea breeze.

== Reception ==
The film won awards at the Brest European Short Film Festival and the L.A. Outfest.

Thibault Shilt of Senses of Cinema has cited the film as an example of a trend in recent French cinema of presenting sexual fluidity in &quot;new, innovative ways.&quot;

<doc id="789992" wikidata="Q3921962" url="?curid=789992" title="Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy">
<text>Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy is a 1909 five-minute silent trick film directed by J. Stuart Blackton.

In the film, a smoker (Paul Panzer) falls asleep and is visited by two fairies (one of which is played by Gladys Hulette). Audiences marveled at the special effects featuring the fairies interacting with objects much larger than themselves.

&quot;Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy&quot; was the first instance of tobacco product placement (for Sweet Corporal cigarettes and cigars) in the movies.

In 2003, it was among the 25 films added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Production ==
The film was produced and most likely directed by J. Stuart Blackton, an illustrator and one of the most important figures in early film history. Blackton specialized in &quot;trick films&quot; and sharpened his skill with early special effects making fake footage of the Spanish-American War and animated films. &quot;Princess Nicotine&quot; was shot by Tony Gaudio, who used mirrors to achieve a deep depth of field. The film was probably inspired by Émile Cohl&#x27;s &quot;The Animated Matches&quot; (1908), which had previously featured stop-motion matches that appeared to move by themselves. Blackton and Gaudio also employed hidden wires, double exposures, giant props, and smoke to make the film appear magical and dreamlike. The film&#x27;s special effects astonished audiences, and &quot;Scientific American&quot; dedicated an article to explaining how the film was made.

==Reception==
Frederick A. Talbot, in &quot;Moving Pictures: How They Are Made and Worked&quot;, proclaims that &quot;&quot;Princess Nicotine&quot; ranks as one of the finest trick films ever made in the United States&quot;, and explains the production&#x27;s &quot;tricks&quot; in great detail.

<text>Andrei Dmitriyevich Linde (; born March 2, 1948) is a Russian-American theoretical physicist and the Harald Trap Friis Professor of Physics at Stanford University.

Linde is one of the main authors of the inflationary universe theory, as well as the theory of eternal inflation and inflationary multiverse. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Moscow State University. In 1975, Linde was awarded a PhD from the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow. He worked at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) since 1989 and moved to the United States in 1990, where he became professor of physics at Stanford University. Among the various awards he has received for his work on inflation, in 2002 he was awarded the Dirac Medal, along with Alan Guth of MIT and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University. In 2004 he received, along with Alan Guth, the Gruber Prize in Cosmology for the development of inflationary cosmology. In 2012 he, along with Alan Guth, was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. In 2014 he received the Kavli Prize in Astrophysics &quot;for pioneering the theory of cosmic inflation&quot;, together with Alan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky. In 2018 he received the Gamow Prize.

== Cosmological phase transitions and old inflation ==

During 1972 to 1976, David Kirzhnits and Andrei Linde developed a theory of cosmological phase transitions. According to this theory, there was not much difference between weak, strong and electromagnetic interactions in the very early universe. These interactions became different from each other only gradually, after the cosmological phase transitions which happened when the temperature in the expanding Universe&#x27;s became sufficiently small. In 1974, Linde found that the energy density of scalar fields that break the symmetry between different interactions can play the role of the vacuum energy density (the cosmological constant) in the Einstein equations. Between 1976 and 1978, Linde demonstrated that the release of this energy during the cosmological phase transitions may be sufficient to heat up the universe.

These observations became the main ingredients of the first version of the inflationary universe theory proposed by Alan Guth in 1980. This theory, now called the &quot;old inflation theory&quot;, was based on the assumption that the universe was initially hot. It then experienced the cosmological phase transitions and was temporarily stuck in a supercooled metastable vacuum state (a false vacuum). The universe then expanded exponentially – &quot;inflated&quot; – until the false vacuum decayed and the universe became hot again. This idea attracted much attention because it could provide a unique solution to many difficult problems of the standard Big Bang theory. In particular, it could explain why the universe is so large and so uniform. However, as Guth immediately realized, this scenario did not quite work as intended: the decay of the false vacuum would make the universe extremely inhomogeneous.

== New inflation ==

In 1981, during a seminar by Stephen Hawking on quantum gravity, Linde developed another version of inflationary theory that he called &quot;new inflation&quot;. He demonstrated that the bubbles not joining up (see page 138 of &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Chapter 8) could be solved if there was a bubble that contained our region of the universe in it. He also said that the phase transition must have taken place slowly inside the bubble. This theory resolved the problems of the original model proposed by Guth while preserving most of its attractive features. A few months later, a similar scenario was proposed by Andreas Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt which referenced Linde&#x27;s paper. Soon after that, it was realized that the new inflationary scenario also suffered from some problems. Most of them arose because of the standard assumption that the early universe initially was very hot, and inflation occurred during the cosmological phase transitions.

== Chaotic inflation ==

In 1983, Linde abandoned some of the key principles of old and new inflation and proposed a more general inflationary theory, chaotic inflation. Chaotic inflation occurs in a much broader class of theories, without any need for the assumption of initial thermal equilibrium. The basic principles of this scenario became incorporated in most of the presently existing realistic versions of inflationary theory. Chaotic inflation changed the way we think about the beginning of inflation. Later on, Linde also proposed a possible modification of the way in which inflation may end, by developing the hybrid inflation scenario. In that model, inflation ends due to the &quot;waterfall&quot; instability .

== Creation of matter in the universe ==

According to the inflationary theory, all elementary particles in the universe emerged after the end of inflation, in a process called reheating. The first version of the theory of reheating, which is essentially the theory of creation of matter in the universe, was developed in 1982 by Alexander Dolgov and Linde, and also by L.F. Abbott, Edward Farhi and Mark B. Wise. In 1994, this theory was revised by L.A. Kofman, Linde and Alexei Starobinsky. They have shown that the process of creation of matter after inflation may be much more efficient due to the effect of parametric resonance. 

==Inflationary multiverse and eternal chaotic inflation==

Perhaps the most far-reaching prediction made by Linde was related to what is now called the theory of inflationary multiverse, or string theory landscape. In 1982-1983, Steinhardt, Linde and Alexander Vilenkin realized that exponential expansion in the new inflation scenario, once it begins, continues without end in some parts of the universe. On the basis of this scenario, Linde proposed a model of a self-reproducing inflationary universe consisting of different parts. These parts are exponentially large and uniform, because of inflation. Therefore, for all practical purposes each of these parts looks like a separate mini-universe, or pocket universe, independent of what happens in other parts of the universe.

Inhabitants of each of these parts might think that the universe everywhere looks the same, and masses of elementary particles, as well as the laws of their interactions, must be the same all over the world. However, in the context of inflationary cosmology, different pocket universes may have different laws of low-energy physics operating in each of them. Thus our world, instead of being a single spherically symmetric expanding balloon, becomes a huge fractal, an inflationary multiverse consisting of many different pocket universes with different properties. This provided a simple scientific interpretation of the cosmological anthropic principle: Our world may consist of different parts, but we can live only in those parts of the multiverse which can support life as we know it.

These ideas did not attract much attention at that time, in part because the anthropic principle was very unpopular, in part because the new inflationary scenario did not quite work and was replaced by the chaotic inflation scenario. However, in 1986 Linde found that in many versions of the chaotic inflation scenario, the process of exponential expansion of the universe also continues forever in some parts of the universe. Linde called this process eternal inflation. Quantum fluctuations produced during eternal chaotic inflation are so large that they can easily push different parts of the universe from one vacuum state to another, and even change the effective dimensionality of spacetime. This provided a very powerful realization of the theory of the multiverse.

Linde and his Stanford colleague Vitaly Vanchurin calculated the number of all possible universes, to be about 10^10^16 if we do not consider the fact that humans as observers are limited in their ability to distinguish more universes. If this is taken into account, there could be as many as 10^10^10^7 universes. By analyzing the slow-roll inflation mechanism that initially generated the quantum fluctuations, the scientists could estimate the number of resulting universes at 10^10^10^7.

== Inflation and string theory ==

A significant advance in this area was obtained when the theory of inflationary multiverse was implemented in the context of string theory. In 2000, Raphael Bousso and Joseph Polchinski proposed using the regime of eternal inflation and transitions between many different vacua in string theory for solving the cosmological constant problem. At that time, no stable or metastable vacua of string theory were actually known. A possible mechanism of string theory vacuum stabilization was proposed in 2003 by Shamit Kachru, Renata Kallosh, Linde, and Sandip Trivedi, who also found that all of these vacua describing expanding universe are metastable, i.e. they must eventually decay (see KKLT mechanism). Then Michael R. Douglas and his collaborators estimated that the total number of different stringy vacua can be as large as 10500, or even more, and Leonard Susskind developed the string theory landscape scenario based on investigation of cosmological phase transitions between different string theory vacua.

One of the main challenges of this theory is to find the probability of living in each of these different parts of the universe. However, once string theory is invoked, it is extremely difficult to return to the previous picture of a single universe. In order to do so, one would need to prove that only one of the many vacua of string theory is actually possible, and to propose an alternative solution of the many problems which can be solved by using the anthropic cosmological principle in the context of the theory of inflationary multiverse.,

Linde continues his work on the theory of inflationary multiverse. In particular, Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde, together with their collaborators, developed a theory of cosmological attractors. This is a broad class of versions of inflationary cosmology which provide one of the best fits to the latest observational data.

== Honors and awards ==

In July 2012, Linde was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur Yuri Milner. In 2014, he was a co-recipient, with Alan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky, of the Kavli Prize awarded by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

Linde is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

== Personal life ==

Linde is married to Renata Kallosh. They have two sons.

His parents were Soviet physicists Irina Rakobolskaya and .

== Political positions ==
In February–March 2022, he signed an open letter by Russian scientists condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and another open letter by Breakthrough Prize laureates with the same message.

<text>The Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (), commonly known as ITAM, is a private university located in Mexico City. It is one of Mexico&#x27;s most important institutions of higher learning; highly prestigious in the social sciences. It is also considered one of Mexico&#x27;s think tanks and has the highest rank of admission to the Mexican Foreign Service.

==History==
It was originally an Economics School and one year later it opened its undergraduate business school. Due to the opening of the Accounting School, the institute grew from 52 students in 1947 to 500 in 1951. In 1963, by government decree, the ITAM was recognized as a “Free University School” and the school added the word &quot;autonomous&quot; to its name. However the inclusion of the word autonomous in its name was not recognized officially by the government until 1985.

During the 1970s new programs were added including applied mathematics (1974), social science (1975) and a Master of Business Administration (1974). In the 1980s and &#x27;90s the additions were: law (1980), actuarial science (1982), computer science (1983), political science (1991, instead of social science), international relations (1992), telematics (1993) and industrial engineering (1997). During the last decade the academic offer was increased by the establishment of business engineering (2004), financial management and mechatronics (2010).

==Campuses==

During its first four years the ITAM was originally located in a house in Mexico City&#x27;s &quot;centro&quot; in 518 La Palma street. In 1950 the institute moved to 65 Serapio Rendón street in the Colonia San Rafael. During the late 1950s it moved once more to a new building built specially for the institute at the corner of Marina Nacional street and Lago Zirahuen street in the Colonia Anáhuac. Finally, in 1978, ITAM moved to its current campus in 1 Río Hondo, in San Ángel. In 1991 the smaller graduate school campus, in 939 Camino Santa Teresa, was opened.

==Administration and organization==

===Rectors===
During its 60 years ITAM has had eight rectors:

* Arturo Fernández Pérez, &quot;(1992 to date)&quot;.
* Javier Beristain Iturbide, &quot;(1972–1991)&quot;.
* Antonio Carrillo Flores, &quot;(1971–1972)&quot;.
* Joaquín Gómez Morín, &quot;(1968–1971)&quot;.
* Enrique Moreno de Tagle, &quot;(1967–1968)&quot;.
* Gustavo Petricioli Iturbide, &quot;(1967)&quot;.
* Agustín de la Llera, &quot;(1952–1967)&quot;.
* Eduardo García Máynez, &quot;(1946–1951)&quot;.

===Academic divisions (schools)===

Today the institute has 38 academic programs dependent on and organized in 5 academic divisions, subdivided in 14 academic departments (equivalent to Schools). The academic programs include Licenciaturas and Ingenierias (equivalent to B.A., B.Sc. and LL.B.), as well as Masters (M.A., MBA and M.Sc.) and a Ph.D. program.

====Academic Division of Economics, Law and Social Sciences (School of Economics, Law and Social Sciences)====
This division is in charge of:

* B.A./B.Sc. in economics
* B.A. in political science
* LL.B.
* M.A. in economics (applied economics)
* M.A. in human rights

* Ph.D. in economics

=====Department of Economics=====
The ITAM, through this department, offers an education in modern economics, with a considerable emphasis on analytic techniques and economic models, in line with the subjects being taught in economics departments around the world. The Department of Economics has been especially influential. It is a major feeder for Latin American candidates into top international graduate programs, and has played an important role in the economic liberalization process that the Mexican Government started in the mid 1980s; in the last 20 years most of Mexico&#x27;s Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Finance have been either ITAM professors or alumni. The department is ranked as the best Economics school in Mexico, depending on the survey, and one of the Top 75 Economics departments globally.

=====Department of Political Science=====
The Department of Political Science has been considered the leading faculty in the field since the mid 1980s. With the formal change of the major in 1991, the program was adapted to modern American political science, and thus incorporated important tools like mathematics, economics and statistics. The program has since been a tremendous success, becoming a leading school in the subject. This is largely due to the number of students and full-time faculty with PhDs from other leading universities such as Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Duke, Chicago, Michigan, Princeton, UCLA, UCSD, and Yale. Many of its undergraduate students are recruited in the best universities in the United States and Europe and others are employed in the federal and local governments and political parties.

Both BSc programs it maintains have been hugely successful in providing high level technical skills to its students, which often obtain graduate degrees abroad in Math, Finance, Economics, Statistics and Operations Research.

====Academic Division of General and International Studies (School of General and International Studies)====
This division is in charge of:

*B.A. in International Relations.

=====Department of International Studies=====
The Department of International Studies is one of the main research centers of diplomatic studies in Mexico and Latin America.

<text>The Spengler Cup is an annual invitational ice hockey tournament held in Davos, Switzerland. First held in 1923, the Spengler Cup is often cited as the oldest invitational ice hockey tournament in the world. The event is hosted by the Swiss team HC Davos and played each year in Davos from 26 December to 31 inclusively. Currently, all games are held at the Eisstadion Davos.

It was originally devised by Dr. Carl Spengler as a means to promote teams from German-speaking Europe, who might have suffered ostracism in the aftermath of World War I. Eventually, the tournament grew well beyond expectations. Many of Europe&#x27;s most prestigious clubs and national programs have appeared, including Soviet, Czechoslovak, Swedish, German, and Finnish powerhouses. Through its history, club or national teams from 13 countries have won the tournament, with HC Davos tied with Team Canada in winning the most cups as a club (16) while various teams from Switzerland have won the most cups for one country (22).

Among non-European organizations, Team Canada, Team USA, nationally ranked U.S. collegiate teams, reigning AHL Calder Cup and Ontario Hockey Association champions, and even Team Japan (in 1971, building international experience before playing as hosts of the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics) have competed for the Spengler Cup. Since at least 1990, Team Canada has been the only participant from North America, with the exception of the AHL&#x27;s Rochester Americans in 1996 and 2013. Future participation of the AHL has been discussed by tournament organisers and the league.

In the 2018 tournament, Finnish club team KalPa from the city of Kuopio defeated Team Canada 2–1 in the final. The game was decided in the 8th round of a shootout, the first series of game-winning shots in tournament history that determined the winner of the Spengler Cup.

The Spengler Cup tournament was not played in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2024 tournament, Swiss club team HC Fribourg-Gottéron defeated German club team Straubing Tigers 7–2 in the final.

==History==

Many participating teams are club teams, rather than national teams, where a club team might have players from many nations on the roster. The first tournament was won in 1923 by the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, composed of Canadians studying at the University of Oxford.

The first 24 tournaments were dominated by host HC Davos (7 wins, 12 runners-up) and the Czechoslovak club team LTC Prague (7 wins, 2 runners-up). The LTC Prague team was shut down by the Czechoslovak communist authorities after players defected at the 1948 Spengler Cup tournament. Between 1965 and 1983, the tournament was dominated by various Czechoslovak and Soviet teams. Since joining the tournament in 1984, Team Canada has been the dominant participant, with 16 wins and 10 runners-up. Team Canada is made up of Canadians predominantly playing in Europe, as the tournament occurs during the NHL and AHL seasons, though active NHL stars Joe Thornton and Rick Nash played for HC Davos during the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

From its inception until 1978, the tournament was played on an outdoor rink. The outdoor rink still exists outside the indoor arena, and is one of the largest outdoor rinks in the world. Starting in 1978, all tournament games have been played indoors. 

The Spengler Cup was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the tournament was scheduled to return in 2021, Team Canada withdrew from the competition due to problems scheduling a quarantine isolation period before the start of play, and HC Ambrì-Piotta withdrew from the competition due to COVID-19 cases among the club&#x27;s players. The 2021 event was ultimately cancelled on 25 December due to COVID cases within HC Davos.

===Sponsorship===
The Spengler Cup is the second-largest sporting event in Switzerland, after tennis&#x27; Swiss Indoors in Basel. The tournament had a budget of CHF 11 million in 2016. About 40% of the total tournament budget amount comes from corporate sponsors. Since 1985, UBS has been the main sponsor and presenting partner of the Spengler Cup. Other current major sponsors are Würth, Schenker Storen, Škoda, Calanda, and Hostpoint.ch – each of whom, along with UBS, are the main tournament sponsor of one of the six teams each year.

==International broadcasts==
The Spengler Cup is broadcast on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen in Switzerland, on Eurosport 2 in most of Europe, on Match TV and NTv2 in Russia, on Sport1 in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, on Šport TV in Slovenia, on TSN and RDS in Canada and on the streaming service Viaplay in the United Kingdom.

<text>Peter Henry Abrahams Deras (3 March 1919 – 18 January 2017), commonly known as Peter Abrahams, was a South African-born novelist, journalist and political commentator who in 1956 settled in Jamaica, where he lived for the rest of his life. His death at the age of 97 is considered to have been murder.

== Biography ==

=== Early years and education ===

Abrahams was born in 1919 in Vrededorp, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa; his father was from Ethiopia and his mother was Coloured, with French and African roots. Abrahams was five years old when his father died, and with his family thereafter struggling financially his mother sent him to live with relatives until the age of 11, when he became a boarding student at the Anglican Church&#x27;s Grace Dieu School in Pietersburg. On graduation from there, he went to St Peter&#x27;s Secondary School in Rosettenville, paying his tuition fees by working at the Bantu Men&#x27;s Social Centre.

=== Move to London (1939) and Jamaica (1956) ===

In 1939, Abrahams left South Africa, and worked first as a sailor, and then settled in London, where he was a journalist. While working in London, Abrahams lived with his wife Daphne in Loughton, whilst meeting several important black leaders and writers.

Hoping to make his way as a writer, he faced considerable challenges as a South African, as Carol Polsgrove has shown in her history, &quot;Ending British Rule: Writers in a Common Cause&quot; (2009). Despite a manuscript reader&#x27;s recommendation against publication, in 1942 Allen &amp; Unwin brought out his &quot;Dark Testament&quot;, made up mostly of pieces he had carried with him from South Africa. Publisher Dorothy Crisp published his novels &quot;Song of the City&quot; (1945) and &quot;Mine Boy&quot; (1946). According to Nigerian scholar Kolawole Ogungbesan, &quot;Mine Boy&quot; became &quot;the first African novel written in English to attract international attention.&quot; More books followed with publication in Britain and the United States: two novels —&quot;The Path of Thunder&quot; (1948) and &quot;Wild Conquest&quot; (1950); a journalistic account of a return journey to Africa, &quot;Return to Goli&quot; (1953); and a memoir, &quot;Tell Freedom&quot; (1954).

In 1945, Abrahams helped to organised the fifth Pan-African Congress which took place in Manchester and is today regarded as a turning point within the independence struggle. In attendance at the event were names like Kwame Nkrumah, Hastings Banda, Jomo Kenyatta and W. E. B. Du Bois. 
In 1956, Abrahams published a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about the political community of which he had been a part in London: &quot;A Wreath for Udomo&quot;. His main character, Michael Udomo, who returns from London to his African country to preside over its transformation into an independent, industrial nation, appeared to be modelled chiefly on Nkrumah with a hint of Kenyatta. Other identifiable fictionalized figures included George Padmore. The novel concluded with Udomo&#x27;s murder. Published the year before Nkrumah took the reins of independent Ghana, &quot;A Wreath for Udomo&quot; was not an optimistic forecast of Africa&#x27;s future.

Abrahams is commemorated by a blue plaque on his former council house in Jessel Drive in Loughton, London installed in 2020.

In 1956, Abrahams settled in Jamaica, where he continued novels and memoirs, also working as a journalist and radio commentator. In 1994 he was awarded the Musgrave Gold Medal for his writing and journalism by the Institute of Jamaica.

=== Death ===
Abrahams was found dead at his home in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica, on 18 January 2017, aged 97. A forensic examination showed that Abrahams was a victim of foul play. A local 61-year-old man, Norman Tomlinson, was later charged with murder. Court proceedings began in March 2017 after a delay due to a lengthy power outage in the court house; and on 7 October 2018, having pleaded guilty to manslaughter, Tomlinson was jailed for seven years.

== Writing ==

Peter Abrahams is one of South Africa&#x27;s most prominent writers, his works dealing with political and social issues, especially with racism. His novel &quot;Mine Boy&quot; (1946), one of the first works to bring him to critical attention, and his memoir &quot;Tell Freedom&quot; (1954) deal in part with apartheid. His other works include the story collection &quot;Dark Testament&quot; (1942) and the novels &quot;The Path of Thunder&quot; (1948, which inspired both a ballet of the same name and the opera &quot;Reiter der Nacht&quot; by Ernst Hermann Meyer), &quot;A Wreath for Udomo&quot; (1956), &quot;A Night of Their Own&quot; (1965), the Jamaica-set &quot;This Island Now&quot; (1966, the only one of his novels not set in Africa) and &quot;The View from Coyaba&quot; (1985). His memoir &quot;The Coyaba Chronicles&quot; was published in 2000.

<text>The Atomiswave is a custom arcade system board and cabinet from Sammy Corporation. It is based on Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast console, sharing similarities with the NAOMI, 
as far as it uses interchangeable game cartridges, as well as a removable module for changing the control scheme (including dual joysticks, dual light guns and a steering wheel), but unlike the NAOMI, the Atomiswave does not feature expanded RAM compared to the Dreamcast.

With the retirement of the aging Neo Geo MVS system, SNK Playmore chose the Atomiswave as its next system to develop games for. In a contract with Sammy, SNK Playmore agreed to develop five games for the Atomiswave system. &quot;Metal Slug 6&quot; was SNK Playmore&#x27;s fifth game for the Atomiswave, after which SNK moved on to a Taito Type X2 arcade board. Sega ended technical support for the system and its games on March 31, 2017. Since its discontinuation, the Atomiswave library has received homebrew conversions to the Dreamcast.

<doc id="790060" wikidata="Q38914" url="?curid=790060" title="Lap dog">
<text>A lap dog or lapdog is a dog that is both small enough to be held in the arms or lie comfortably on a person&#x27;s lap and temperamentally predisposed to doing so. &quot;Lapdog&quot; is not a specific breed, but a generic term for a type of dog that is small in size and friendly toward humans.

Lap dogs historically have been kept in many societies around the world by individuals with the resources to support a non-productive animal, and a lifestyle which allows for much contact with the dog. They are docile companion animals with no working function other than companionship. Genetic analysis reveals that lapdogs are among the earliest specific types of dogs to live with people. Today, most lapdog breeds fall into the &quot;toy&quot; breed group.

Additionally, the term &quot;lapdog&quot; is also used to refer to a person, organization or country controlled by another who is stronger.

==Appearance==

Some lapdogs have been bred for extremes of small size, such as the Russian and Mexican varieties shown below. Anatomically, lapdogs show distinct differences from their full-sized counterparts. The skull of the immature &quot;Russian lapdog&quot; from an 1861 specimen (possibly an ancestor of the Bolonka) is approximately the size of a table-tennis ball and shows the relatively short muzzle and high forehead. Many lapdogs are bred to retain puppy-like traits (neoteny) such as folded ears. Body proportions may also have changed, resulting in relatively shorter legs and larger heads. They may also have traits that resemble human babies: size and weight, high forehead, short muzzle and relatively large eyes. Although selective breeding for such traits can have detrimental effects on tear ducts, dentition, and breathing, such traits also serve to cause pet owners to derive more satisfaction from their pet relationship, as the pet owners may view dogs with this appearance as surrogate babies.

==History==
In addition to their being kept as a pet and providing warmth, lap dogs have been fashion accessories and status symbols, and even to attract fleas away from their owners.

Recent genetic study by Elaine Ostrander confirms that the Pekingese lapdog, bred in ancient China to fit inside the sleeves of a man&#x27;s robe, is one of the oldest breeds of dog. For centuries, they could be owned only by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace. Similarly ancient are the lapdog ancestors of the modern breeds of Tibetan Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Pug, and Shih Tzu.

In the book &quot;De Canibus Britannicis&quot; published in English in 1576, the author describes lapdogs as a &quot;type&quot; of dog, &quot;Spaniel Gentle or Comforter&quot;. Ancestors of the modern breed of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were a type of &quot;Spaniel Gentle&quot; kept by English nobility in the 17th century. Modern breeds of lapdog also include the Bichon Frise, Japanese Terrier, Maltese, Pomeranian, Yorkshire Terrier and many others.

=== Phalène and Papillon ===

The Phalène is the earliest form of the Papillon; the appearance of the erect-eared variety was not documented until the 16th century, by which time the Phalène had been portrayed in numerous paintings, particularly in portraits of the wealthy by Old Masters and their students. Belgium, France, Spain, and Italy have all been credited with the creation or development of Butterfly Dogs. The dog breed appeared often in portraits of European royalty painted by the Old Masters, which indicates that this breed was favored as lapdogs as early as the 13th century.
This breed is no longer considered a lap dog. This sportive and intelligent breed is used in various activities, such as agility, obe-rythme, cani-cross, etc. Its intelligence is among the best of all dog breeds (8/132), which places it before some other breeds regarded as highly intelligent, such as the Rottweiler and the Aussie.

=== Pekingese ===
According to the 1948 publication &quot;Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain&quot; by Clifford LB Hubbard, the Sleeve Pekingese was (in Hubbard&#x27;s time) a true miniature of the standard-sized Pekingese and was also known as the Miniature Pekingese. The name &quot;Sleeve Pekingese&quot; came from the custom of carrying these small dogs in the capacious sleeves of the robes worn by members of the Chinese Imperial Household. Hubbard indicated that this tradition appeared to be early Italian rather than Chinese, but its adoption by the Chinese Imperial Household led to dogs being bred as small as possible and to practices aimed at stunting their growth: giving puppies rice wine, holding new-borns tightly for hours at a time or putting the puppies into tight-fitting wire mesh waistcoats. These practices were apparently forbidden by the late Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi.

In Hubbard&#x27;s time, the term &quot;Sleeve&quot; was applied in Britain to a miniature Pekingese no more than 6–7 pounds in weight, often appearing to be about 3–4 pounds. Mrs Flander&#x27;s &quot;Mai Mai&quot; weighed only a little over 4 pounds and many other breeders had bred true miniatures of a similar size. Hubbard noted that miniatures sometimes appeared in litters bred from full-sized Pekingese and were exhibited in classes for dogs less than 7 pounds at the major dog shows in Britain. At that time, the Sleeve Pekingese had a strong following with the most popular colours being cream and white.

=== Chihuahua ===
Chihuahuas are one of the smallest lap dog breeds. They are named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, as that is the dog&#x27;s potential origin. They are famous for their big pointy ears, high pitched bark, and small size. Chihuahuas usually weigh less than and are usually tall. As with many tiny dogs, Chihuahuas need proper training and socialization to avoid unwanted defensive behavior. Chihuahuas enjoy quality time in the lap of a favorite person, and if properly managed by a dedicated owner, the Chihuahua can adapt to a household environment easily.

=== Pomeranian ===
Pomeranians are the fluffiest of lap dogs, have a double coat and tend to be a friendly, one-person dog. The Pomeranian has a shedding non-hypoallergenic coat with black, white, black &amp; tan, red, blue, orange, brown and gray colors. The Pomeranian is named after the Pomerania region in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.

=== Miniature Pinscher ===
The Miniature Pinscher, min pin for short, is a small breed of dog originating from Germany. The breed&#x27;s earliest ancestors may have included the German Pinscher mixed with Italian greyhounds and dachshunds.

=== Shih Tzu===
Shih Tzu (singular and plural) is one of oldest breeds the roots of which trace back to Tibet and China where they were bred to resemble lions. They ideally range from 9–16 lbs.

==Extinct breeds==


The Russian Lapdog and the Mexican Lapdog were not breeds in the modern sense, but were types of small dogs from Russia and Mexico respectively. The immature Mexican Lapdog could be as small as a golden hamster. During the 19th century it was fashionable to mount immature specimens to look like adults, giving a false impression of adult size:

<text>A centimetre or millimetre of water (US spelling &quot;centimeter&quot; or &quot;millimeter of water&quot;) are less commonly used measures of pressure based on the pressure head of water.

==Centimetre of water==

A &quot;centimetre of water&quot; is a unit of pressure. It may be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water of 1 cm in height at 4 °C (temperature of maximum density) at the standard acceleration of gravity, so that = × × 1 cm = ≈ , but conventionally a nominal maximum water density of is used, giving .

The centimetre of water unit is frequently used to measure the central venous pressure, the intracranial pressure while sampling cerebrospinal fluid, as well as determining pressures during mechanical ventilation or in water supply networks (then usually in metres water column). It is also a common unit of pressure in the speech sciences. This unit is commonly used to specify the pressure to which a CPAP machine is set after a polysomnogram.

==Millimetre of water==

&quot;Millimetre of water&quot; (US spelling &quot;millimeter of water&quot;) is a unit of pressure. It may be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water of 1 mm in height at 4 °C (temperature of maximum density) at the standard acceleration of gravity, so that = × × 1 mm = ≈ , but conventionally a nominal maximum water density of is used, giving .

In limited and largely historic contexts it may vary with temperature, using the equation:
: &quot;P&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;·&quot;g&quot;·&quot;h&quot;/1000,
: where
: &quot;P&quot;: pressure in Pa
: &quot;ρ&quot;: density of water (conventionally 1000 kg/m3 at 4 °C)
: &quot;g&quot;: acceleration due to gravity (conventionally 9.80665 m/s2 but sometimes locally determined)
: &quot;h&quot;: water height in millimetres.

The unit is often used to describe how much water rainwear or other outerwear can take or how much water a tent can resist without leaking.

<doc id="790065" wikidata="Q5674472" url="?curid=790065" title="Hartford Convention">
<text>The Hartford Convention was a series of meetings from December 15, 1814, to January 5, 1815, in Hartford, Connecticut, United States, in which New England leaders of the Federalist Party met to discuss their grievances concerning the ongoing War of 1812 and the political problems arising from the federal government&#x27;s increasing power.

This convention discussed removing the three-fifths compromise and requiring a two-thirds majority in Congress for the admission of new states, declarations of war, and creating laws restricting trade. The Federalists also discussed their grievances with the Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo of 1807. However, weeks after the convention&#x27;s end, news of Major General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s overwhelming victory in New Orleans swept over the Northeast. This led to an increased sense of nationalism, and many thought the Federalists were traitors. As a result, this discredited and disgraced the Federalists, resulting in their elimination as a major national political force.

The convention was controversial at the time, and many historians consider it a contributing factor to the downfall of the Federalist Party. There are many reasons for this, not least of which was the suggestion that the states of New England, the Federalists&#x27; main base, secede from the United States union and create a new country. Historians generally doubt that the convention was seriously considering this.

==Background==
===American relations with Great Britain===
Under the administrations of George Washington and John Adams, vigorous trade with France was maintained while both administrations engaged in an undeclared war with France. With the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars at the same time that Thomas Jefferson assumed office, relations with both France and Great Britain deteriorated. Jefferson&#x27;s goal was an expansion of free trade through Great Britain&#x27;s lifting of trade restrictions placed against the United States. However, to pressure Britain into compliance, he adopted anti-foreign trade policies such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809. These policies were very unpopular among Northeastern merchants and shippers. Jefferson&#x27;s successor, President James Madison, and what was now called the Democratic-Republican Party, continued his policies.

The opposing Federalist Party regained strength, especially in New England and New York; it collaborated with Lieutenant Governor DeWitt Clinton of New York City and supported him for president in 1812.

===Opposition to the War of 1812===
When Madison was re-elected in 1812 the discontent in New England intensified. In late 1813 Madison signed a more restrictive embargo act than any of those approved by Jefferson, this time prohibiting all trade between American ports (the coastal trade) and fishing outside harbors. By the summer of 1814, the war had turned against the Americans. After ending their war with Napoleonic France, Great Britain was able to marshal more resources to North America and had effectively blockaded the entire eastern coastline. Territory in the Maine district of Massachusetts was occupied in July, in August the White House and Capitol were burned, and by September the British were advancing further in Maine and the Lake Champlain area of New York. A naval assault on Boston was expected in the near future. Free trade with the rest of the world had virtually ceased, thousands were thrown out of work, and by August banks were suspending specie payment. The federal government was approaching bankruptcy.

New England governors followed a policy of giving minimal support to the Federal government in waging the war. With the exception of Governor John Taylor Gilman of New Hampshire, most requisitions for state militia were denied. New Englanders were reluctant to have their militia, needed to defend their coasts from British attacks, assigned elsewhere or placed under the command of the regular army. General Winfield Scott, after the war, blamed Madison&#x27;s policy of ignoring Federalists, who in New England constituted the best-educated class, when granting regular army commissions in New England.

The anti-war sentiment in Massachusetts was so strong that even Samuel Dexter, the Democratic-Republican candidate for governor, opposed the national party&#x27;s commerce policies. Federalists still dominated the 1814 elections, returning Caleb Strong as governor and electing 360 Federalists against only 156 Democratic-Republicans to the lower house of the Massachusetts Legislature. In September Governor Strong refused a request to provide and support 5,000 troops to retake territory in Maine.

Because Massachusetts and Connecticut had refused to subject their militia to the orders of the War Department, Madison declined to pay their expenses. Consequently, critics said that Madison had abandoned New England to the common enemy. The Massachusetts Legislature appropriated $1 million to support a state army of 10,000 men. Harrison Gray Otis, who inspired these measures, suggested that the eastern states meet at a convention in Hartford, Connecticut. As early as 1804 Timothy Pickering and other Federalists discussed secession from the Union if the national government became too oppressive.

In September 1814, Madison asked Congress for a conscription bill. Even though this had not been one of the original grievances that led to the call for the convention, Federalists presented this as further proof that the Democratic-Republicans intended to bring military despotism into the nation. Thomas Grosvenor of New York saw this as the result of the administration leading the country &quot;defenseless and naked, into that lake of blood she is yet swimming.&quot;

===Secession===
Secession was again mentioned in 1814–1815; all but one leading Federalist newspaper in New England supported a plan to expel the western states from the Union. Otis, the key leader of the Convention, blocked radical proposals such as a seizure of the Federal customs house, impounding federal funds, or declaring neutrality. Otis thought the Madison administration was near collapse and that unless conservatives like himself and the other delegates took charge, the radical secessionists might take power. Indeed, Otis was unaware that Massachusetts Governor Strong had already sent a secret mission to discuss terms with the British for a separate peace.

There are several reasons why historians doubt that the New England Federalists were seriously considering secession. All the states, especially Connecticut with its claims to western lands, stood to lose more than they would gain. Efforts were made in the delegation selection process to exclude firebrands like John Lowell, Jr., Timothy Pickering, and Josiah Quincy who might have pushed for secession, and the final report of the convention did not propose secession. Nevertheless, Southern secessionists cited the convention as precedent in the crisis that preceded the American Civil War, which then became a standard part of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy after the war.

Despite this, the Madison administration had reasons to be concerned about the consequences of the Hartford Convention. Federalists were already blocking administration efforts to finance the war and bring it to a successful conclusion with an invasion of Canada. There were fears that New England would negotiate a separate peace with Great Britain, an action in many ways just as harmful to the nation as actual secession. In preparing for a worst-case scenario, Madison moved troops from the New York–Canada border to Albany where they could quickly be sent to Massachusetts or Connecticut to preserve federal authority. Several New England regiments that had participated in the Niagara campaign were returned home where it was hoped that they could serve as a focal point for New Englanders opposed to disunion.

==Call for a convention==
In response to the war crisis, Massachusetts Governor Strong called the newly elected General Court to a special session on October 5, 1814. Strong&#x27;s message to the legislature was referred to a joint committee headed by Harrison Gray Otis. Otis was considered a moderate. His report delivered three days later called for resistance of any British invasion, criticized the leadership that had brought the nation close to disaster, and called for a convention of New England states to deal with both their common grievances and common defense. Otis&#x27; report was passed by the state senate on October 12 by a 22 to 12 vote and the house on October 16 by 260 to 20.

A letter was sent to the other New England governors, inviting them to send delegates to a convention in Hartford, Connecticut. The stated purpose of the convention was to propose constitutional amendments to protect their section&#x27;s interests and to make arrangements with the Federal government for their own military defense.

Twelve delegates were appointed by the Massachusetts legislature, of which George Cabot and Harrison G. Otis were chief (see list below). In Connecticut, the legislature denounced Madison&#x27;s &quot;odious and disastrous war&quot;, voiced concern about plans to implement a national draft, and selected seven delegates led by Chauncey Goodrich and James Hillhouse. Rhode Island&#x27;s legislature selected four delegates to discuss &quot;the best means of cooperating for our mutual defense against the common enemy, and upon the measures which it may be in the power of said states, consistently with their obligations to adopt, to restore and secure to the people thereof, their rights and privileges under the Constitution of the United States&quot;. New Hampshire&#x27;s legislature was not in session and its Federalist governor, John Gilman, refused to call it back into session. Vermont&#x27;s legislature voted unanimously not to send delegates. Two New Hampshire counties and one Vermont county each sent a delegate, bringing the total to 26. On December 15, 1814 the delegates met in the Connecticut Senate&#x27;s chamber at the Old State House in Hartford.

The following lists the states that attended and the names of the twenty-six attendees.

==Secret meetings==
In all, twenty-six delegates attended the secret meetings. No records of the proceedings were kept, and meetings continued through January 5, 1815. After choosing George Cabot as president and Theodore Dwight as secretary, the convention remained in closed session for three weeks. Cabot&#x27;s journal of its proceedings, opened in 1818, was a meager sketch of formal proceedings; he made no record of yeas and nays, stated none of the amendments offered to the various reports, and neglected to attach the names of authors to proposals. It is impossible to ascertain the speeches or votes of individual delegates.

==Convention report==

The convention ended with a report and resolutions, signed by the delegates present, and adopted on the day before final adjournment. The report said that New England had a &quot;duty&quot; to assert its authority over unconstitutional infringements on its sovereignty—a doctrine that echoed the policy of Jefferson and Madison in 1798 (in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions), and which would later reappear in a different context as &quot;nullification&quot;.

The Hartford Convention&#x27;s final report proposed several amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These attempted to combat the policies of the ruling Democratic-Republicans by: 
#Prohibiting any trade embargo lasting over 60 days; 
#Requiring a two-thirds Congressional majority for declaration of offensive war, admission of a new state, or interdiction of foreign commerce; 
#Removing the three-fifths representation advantage of the South; 
#Limiting future presidents to one term; 
#Requiring each president to be from a different state than his predecessor. (This provision was aimed directly at the dominance of Virginia in the presidency since 1800).

==Negative reception and legacy==
The Democratic-Republican Congress would never have recommended any of New England&#x27;s proposals for ratification. Hartford delegates intended for them to embarrass the President and the Democratic-Republicans in Congress—and also to serve as a basis for negotiations between New England and the rest of the country.

Some delegates may have been in favor of New England&#x27;s secession from the United States and forming an independent republic, though no solution was adopted at the convention. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison rejected the notion that the Hartford convention was an attempt to take New England out of the Union and give treasonous aid and comfort to Britain. Morison wrote: &quot;Democratic politicians, seeking a foil to their own mismanagement of the war and to discredit the still formidable Federalist party, caressed and fed this infant myth until it became so tough and lusty as to defy both solemn denials and documentary proof.&quot;

After the convention, Massachusetts sent three commissioners to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the terms that had been agreed upon. By the time they arrived in February 1815, news of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s overwhelming victory at the Battle of New Orleans, and the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, preceded them and, consequently, their presence in the capital seemed both ludicrous and subversive. They quickly returned home. Thereafter, both &quot;Hartford Convention&quot; and &quot;Federalist Party&quot; became synonymous with disunion, secession, and treason, especially in the South. The party was ruined and ceased to be a significant force in national politics, although in a few places (notably Massachusetts, where Federalists were elected governor annually until 1823) it retained some power.

<doc id="790074" wikidata="Q1234647" url="?curid=790074" title="Mark Smeaton">
<text>Mark Smeaton ( – 17 May 1536) was a musician at the court of Henry VIII of England, in the household of Queen Anne Boleyn. Smeaton – together with the Queen&#x27;s brother George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford; Henry Norris, Francis Weston, and William Brereton – was executed for treason and adultery with Queen Anne.

==Background==

Mark Smeaton&#x27;s exact date of birth is unknown but it is believed he was around 23 years old when he was executed in 1536. While there are few specifics about Smeaton&#x27;s life, it is thought that he was the son of a carpenter and a seamstress. His surname is thought to be of Flemish-French Flemish origin, as &#x27;Smeaton&#x27; could be a derivation of either de Smet or de Smedt.

Known for his talents as a singer, Smeaton was a handsome musician and dancer in Henry VIII&#x27;s court who later transferred into the court of Queen Anne. In addition to his singing ability, he also played the lute, viol, virginals and the organ. Smeaton originally joined the choir of Cardinal Wolsey. After Wolsey&#x27;s fall from grace, Smeaton was transferred from the Cardinal&#x27;s service to Henry&#x27;s Chapel Royal, where his musical ability came to the notice of the Queen. Established as a court musician, he was named a Groom of the Privy Chamber in 1532.

Of lowly social standing, he was never part of the Queen&#x27;s intimate circle of companions, which included her favourite ladies-in-waiting and courtiers. Anne herself once reprimanded him for assuming she would speak to him in the same way she would speak to an aristocrat. A poem by the courtier Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder made reference to his apparent social-climbing.

==Arrest==
His unhappiness was said to have caught Queen Anne&#x27;s attention one day in her chamber at Winchester, when she sent for him to play the virginals. As Anne later confessed, &quot;[On] Saturday before May Day… I found him standing in the round window in my chamber of presence. And I asked him why he was so sad, and he answered and said it was no matter.&quot; Smeaton&#x27;s reply was non-committal. Anne replied, &quot;You may not look to have me speak to you as I should do to a nobleman, because you are an inferior person.&quot; Knowing the truth of her words, Smeaton miserably replied, &quot;No, no, Madam. A look sufficeth, thus fare you well.&quot; Fatefully, this conversation with the Queen was quickly reported to Thomas Cromwell, one of the King&#x27;s advisors, who was looking for evidence of Anne committing treason and adultery. It is generally accepted that Anne was accused of adultery to free her husband, Henry VIII, to marry a new wife, Jane Seymour, to whom he became married the same day Anne&#x27;s execution. On Cromwell&#x27;s orders, Smeaton was arrested on 30 April 1536. Cromwell took Smeaton to his house in Stepney and, according to the Spanish Chronicle, is said to have tortured him with a knotted cord around his eyes. Anne is not thought to have noticed his disappearance nor had she been informed of his arrest.

At 6 pm on 1 May, Smeaton was sent to the Tower of London. Before his arrest, Smeaton was known to spend lavishly on horses and liveries. This was seen as suspicious, as Smeaton earned only £100 a year; the implication being that he had received money from the Queen in exchange for &quot;services&quot; as her lover. While at the Tower, Smeaton confessed to being the Queen&#x27;s lover. The confession did not align with the facts: Smeaton stated he was with the Queen on 13 May 1535 at Greenwich. However, it is recorded that she was not at Greenwich on that date but at Richmond. It is believed that when being pressured to confess, Smeaton also supplied the names of members of the Queen&#x27;s circle and all were subsequently arrested. Those arrested for alleged adultery with Anne as a result of Smeaton&#x27;s confession were Sir Francis Weston, Henry Norris, William Brereton, and her brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. All but Smeaton maintained their innocence, but none of them was tortured as Smeaton was. Out of all those arrested for adultery, Smeaton&#x27;s arrest caused the greatest scandal, because those who knew of the charges were shocked that the Queen would have an affair with a person of such low degree.

A slightly different version of the events surrounding Smeaton&#x27;s guilty plea is told by the nineteenth century English historical writer and poet, Agnes Strickland. Strickland maintained that Smeaton was lured into signing the incriminating deposition by the subtlety of Sir William Fitzwilliam, 1st Earl of Southampton. As Fitzwilliam tried to make Smeaton feel dishonourable enough to confess, he noticed Smeaton&#x27;s terror and said, &quot;Subscribe, Mark, and you will see what will come of it&quot;. Whether Smeaton was tortured or coaxed into guilt, &quot;it was generally said that he had his life promised him, but it was not fit to let him live to tell tales.&quot;

==Trial and execution==
The evidence against Mark Smeaton rested on his expenditure and the one reported conversation. His trial took place at Westminster Hall, but it was generally believed there was no question of his guilt. After being found guilty, Smeaton was condemned to death on 17 May 1536, as were the four other men accused of being the Queen&#x27;s lovers. Queen Anne was condemned to death two days later. It was alleged by one of Anne&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, thought to be Elizabeth Browne, Countess of Worcester, that the Queen &quot;admitted some of her court to come into her chamber at undue hours&quot;. On news that Smeaton was now clapped in irons, Queen Anne replied dismissively, &quot;he was a person of mean birth and the others were all gentlemen&quot;. It is said that when she heard Smeaton had failed to withdraw his &quot;confession&quot; in fully explicit terms, the Queen expressed anger.

As he was being led to his execution, Smeaton stumbled back from the bloody scaffold. Collecting himself, he said despairingly, &quot;Masters, I pray you all pray for me, for I have deserved the death&quot;. Smeaton&#x27;s form of execution was beheading, rather than the brutal quartering usually assigned to commoners; the reason is thought to have been due to his co-operation with Anne&#x27;s enemies.

Smeaton&#x27;s body was buried in a common grave with one of the other accused adulterers, William Brereton. Years after Smeaton&#x27;s death, Queen Mary convinced herself that her sister, Elizabeth, whom she considered a rival for her throne, was illegitimate and actually the product of the alleged affair between Smeaton and Anne. Mary repeated on more than one occasion that she thought Elizabeth had the &quot;face and countenance&quot; of Smeaton. However, Elizabeth&#x27;s resemblance to Henry was so obvious that Mary had little luck in convincing anyone else, and the accusation that Smeaton was Elizabeth&#x27;s father died with Mary.

A poem about the five executed men, allegedly written by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder, contains the following verse dedicated to Mark Smeaton:
&lt;poem&gt;
: Ah! Mark, what moan should I for thee make more,
: Since that thy death thou hast deserved best,
: Save only that mine eye is forced sore
: With piteous plaint to moan thee with the rest?
: A time thou hadst above thy poor degree,
: The fall whereof thy friends may well bemoan:
: A rotten twig upon so high a tree
: Hath slipped thy hold, and thou art dead and gone.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==In popular media==
Smeaton was portrayed by Gary Bond in the 1969 costume dramatic film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;. In it, Smeaton is depicted as being tortured by Cromwell&#x27;s henchmen. In 1971, Michael Osborne portrayed Smeaton in the second episode of &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;. One scene shows the knotted rope being twisted onto his eyes.

In the 1972 feature film remake of the BBC miniseries, &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;, Smeaton is portrayed by Damien Thomas and is depicted participating in a court masque with Anne Boleyn which mocks the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey. The torture of Smeaton is shown in the film in a more explicit fashion than the miniseries.

The character of Mark Smeaton appeared in the second season of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Tudors&quot; and was portrayed by David Alpay. In the series, he is depicted as having a sexual relationship with Anne&#x27;s brother, George Boleyn. It is believed that Smeaton being portrayed as gay may have been based on the theories of Retha Warnicke, who argued that Smeaton and George Boleyn had been sexually intimate.

Smeaton is fleshed out as a character in the novels &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; and &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; by Hilary Mantel, and the TV miniseries adaptation &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Max Fowler. Told from Cromwell&#x27;s point of view, the story shows Smeaton intimidated and manipulated into a confession rather than being tortured. He and the other four accused of adultery with Queen Anne are executed as the culmination of a careful vendetta against them by Cromwell, in revenge for their production of a mocking dramatisation of the downfall of Cardinal Wolsey shortly after his death, which was also depicted in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;.

In the Royal Shakespeare Company plays that Michael Poulton adapted from Hilary Mantel&#x27;s books, also called &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; and &quot;Bring Up The Bodies&quot; (though the latter was changed to &quot;Wolf Hall Part 2&quot; when the plays transferred from England to New York), Joey Batey played Mark Smeaton.

Smeaton appears in Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, in which the character is a trouser role assigned to a contralto.

Jack Benny portrayed Smeaton in an extended fantasy sequence in &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; television show (S:7 E:6) entitled &quot;Jack locked in the Tower of London&quot; which originally aired 2 December 1956.

Chris Clynes portrayed Smeaton in the BBC documentary drama The Six Queens of Henry VIII (S:1 E:2) entitled &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; which originally aired in 2016.

Smeaton was portrayed by Nitai Levi in Michael Poulton&#x27;s 2024 stage adaptation of the Philippa Gregory Novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, directed by Lucy Bailey for the Chichester Festival Theatre.

<doc id="790078" wikidata="Q3324355" url="?curid=790078" title="House of Kalākaua">
<text>The House of Kalākaua, or Kalākaua Dynasty, also known as the Keawe-a-Heulu line, was the reigning family of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under King Kalākaua and Queen Liliʻuokalani. They assumed power after the last king of the House of Kamehameha, Lunalilo, died without designating an heir, leading to the election of Kalākaua and provoking the Honolulu Courthouse riot. The dynasty lost power with the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani and the end of the Kingdom in 1893. Liliʻuokalani died in 1917, leaving only cousins as heirs. 

The House of Kalākaua was descended from chiefs on the islands of Hawaiʻi, Maui, and Kauaʻi. The torch that burns at midday symbolizes the dynasty, based on the sacred kapu Kalākaua&#x27;s ancestor High Chief Iwikauikaua.

== Origin ==
The dynasty was founded by Kalākaua when he ascended the Hawaiian Kingdom throne in 1874 and included his brothers and sisters who were children of Analea Keohokālole (1816–1869) and Caesar Kaluaiku Kapaʻakea (1815–1866). 
The family was of the aliʻi class of the Hawaiian nobility and were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha, sharing common descent from the early 18th-century &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (supreme monarch) Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. The family traces their descent from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, two of the five royal counselors of King Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both Keohokālole and Kapaʻakea, was depicted, along with his royal twin Kamanawa, on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Liliʻuokalani, in her memoir, referred to her family line as the &quot;Keawe-a-Heulu line&quot; after her mother&#x27;s side of the family.

== Fall of the House of Kalākaua ==
With the deposition of Queen Liliʻuokalani in 1893 the House of Kalākaua ceased to reign, and the death of the Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani in 1899 meant the loss of the last direct heir of the siblings of the reigning monarchs of House of Kalākaua. The main line of the dynasty thus ended when the deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani (who had abdicated and renounced) died in 1917. Their cousins came to be known as the House of Kawānanakoa, a branch of the House of Kalākaua, since they are relatives of King Kalākaua, descended from Prince David Kawānanakoa, eldest son of the princess Kūhiō Kinoike Kekaulike, who had died in 1908. The House of Kawānanakoa survives to modern times and at least two of its members have claims to the throne should the Hawaiian monarchy be revived.

== Members ==
* King Kalākaua (1836–1891)
* Queen Liliʻuokalani (1839–1917)
* Crown Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani (1875–1899)

<text>Timothy Mofolorunso Aluko (14 July 1918 – 1 May 2010) was a Nigerian writer.

== Biography ==
A Yoruba, Aluko was born in Ilesha in Nigeria and studied at Government College, Ibadan, and Higher College, Yaba in Lagos. He then studied civil engineering and town planning at the University of London. He held a number of administrative posts in his home country, including Director of Public Works in Western Nigeria. He departed from civil service in 1966 and from then until his retirement in 1978 he pursued a career as an academic, earning a doctorate in municipal engineering in 1976. He received several awards and honours including Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963 and Officer Order of the Niger (OON) in 1964.

His novels, including &quot;One Man, One Wife&quot; (1959), &quot;One Man, One Matchet&quot; (1964), &quot;Kinsman and Foreman&quot; (1966), &quot;Chief the Honourable Minister&quot; (1970) and &quot;His Worshipful Majesty&quot; (1973), are satirical in tone, and deal with the clash of new and old values in a changing Africa.

In 1994, he published his autobiography, &quot;My Years of Service&quot;, an account of his activities as an engineer and university teacher. His later autobiographical book, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;, published in 2007, provides a more in-depth look at Aluko&#x27;s life, expounding on his childhood and his work as a civil servant.

T. M. Aluko died on 1 May 2010 in Lagos, aged 91.

<doc id="790106" wikidata="Q1502075" url="?curid=790106" title="Talbot Tagora">
<text>The Talbot Tagora is an executive car developed by Chrysler Europe and produced by Peugeot Société Anonyme (PSA). The Tagora was marketed under the Talbot marque after PSA took over Chrysler&#x27;s European operations in 1979. PSA presented the first production vehicle in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981. The Tagora fell short of sales expectations, described as a &quot;showroom flop&quot; just a year after its launch, and PSA cancelled the model two years later. Fewer than 20,000 Tagora models were built, all of them at the former Simca factory in Poissy, near Paris, France.

== Development ==
Chrysler Europe began development of the Tagora in 1976, under the code name &quot;C9&quot;, with the goal of replacing the unsuccessful Chrysler 180 series. Following the same development pattern as with the Horizon and Alpine models, the responsibility for the Tagora&#x27;s technical development remained in France, while the styling was devised at Chrysler&#x27;s design centre in the United Kingdom. An early proposal for the name of the car was &quot;Simca 2000&quot;.

=== Design ===
The original &quot;C9&quot; prototype was a modern-styled saloon with a low beltline and large interior dimensions made possible by the long-wheelbase. The British design team initially proposed some stylistic features inspired by the Citroën SM, including a front glass panel between the headlights to accommodate the number plate, round front wheelarches and rear spats. However, Chrysler management in the United States deemed these features too extravagant, so the design of the &quot;C9&quot; became more conventional: front and rear wheelarches were squared off and the spats lost, and the license plate was placed on the front bumper as on most cars. To better balance the tall silhouette, the beltline was raised. Over the course of development, the &quot;C9&quot; also lost its vertical taillights in favour of more &quot;fashionable&quot; horizontal ones.

=== Engine dilemma ===
The main competitors in the executive vehicle market offered engines bigger than the biggest 2.0-litre inline-four engine used by Chrysler Europe, and a six-cylinder engine was generally expected. Consequently, the company had to seek a new engine for the Tagora. One candidate was a straight-six manufactured by Mitsubishi, but it proved unsuitable for a car of this class. The other proposal was the Douvrin V6 engine (the &quot;PRV&quot;), a joint development of PSA, Renault and Volvo. Since the Tagora would be in direct competition with PSA models that used the PRV, it seemed unlikely that Chrysler would be able to procure that engine.

=== Sales projections ===
Chrysler Corporation approved the development of the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5 percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7 percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car&#x27;s tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.

=== PSA takeover ===
During the development of the C9, the management of the bankruptcy-threatened Chrysler Corporation decided to divest itself of its debt-ridden European operations. The buyer was the French PSA Group, formed in 1976 after Peugeot took over Citroën. The deal was finalised in 1978, in which the buyer paid US$1.00 for the entirety of Chrysler Europe and its obligations. The take-over was effective as of 1 January 1979.

While the C9 project was well advanced, PSA already had a crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, including the renowned Citroën CX, the slow-selling Peugeot 604 and the newly launched Peugeot 505. But with so much having already been invested in the project, PSA decided to press ahead and complete the development of C9, albeit with modifications to allow the use of shared parts with other PSA models. The Simca double wishbone front suspension gave way to MacPherson struts adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear axle was replaced with that of the 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width, and thus compromised the C9&#x27;s stance as the rear wheels were now badly inset within their arches. The C9 front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.

== Short market life ==
Following the renaming of Chrysler Europe&#x27;s models to the Talbot marque, the C9 was christened the Talbot Tagora, and the first batch of cars rolled out of the former Simca plant in Poissy in 1980. The same year, PSA presented the Tagora at the Salon de l&#x27;Automobile in Paris. Following a hands-on demonstration of the model to the press in Morocco in March 1981, the car went on sale in France in April and in the United Kingdom in May. The British billboard advertising campaign boasted &quot;The new Talbot Tagora. Luxury and performance redefined.&quot;

The Tagora was priced to overlap with high-end Peugeot 505 and low-end Citroën CX models, while slotting in beneath the Peugeot 604. Its pricing was also comparable to the Renault 20/30 and Ford Granada. The Tagora was in the 20,000–30,000 Deutsch Mark bracket in Germany. During the first fifteen months of the car&#x27;s existence, in 1980/81, a mere 16,169 Tagoras were produced which was only one quarter of Chrysler&#x27;s initial projections. Sales proved insufficient even for this production level, and volumes plummeted by more than 80 percent in 1982. In 1983 the sales figures prompted PSA to cancel the model altogether. By the time the Tagora was discontinued, only about 19,500 had been built; by comparison, over 116,000 Peugeot 505s and 74,000 Citroën CXs were made in 1981 alone.

In December 2010, &quot;Practical Classics&quot; reported that 99.09 percent of all UK-registered Tagoras were no longer on the roads. The last UK-registered Tagora on the road, has been declared on a SORN (statutory off-road notice) since 2016. The last UK-registered Tagora has been put back on the road as of September 2022 

== Powertrains and models ==
As with most large cars of its time, the Tagora was a rear-wheel drive vehicle, with a longitudinally mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and five-speed manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic in the case of the four-cylinder engines.

The available models were:

* 2.2-litre (2155 cc) Type 180 OHC I4, double-barrel Solex carburettor, , .
:The base engine was a version of the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with increased displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have power steering as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.
* 2.3-litre (2304 cc) XD2S OHV turbodiesel I4, , .
:This Peugeot-developed turbodiesel was primarily used in the Peugeot 505 and 604. The diesel-powered version of the Tagora was designated DT.
* 2.7-litre (2664 cc) PRV OHC V6, two triple-barrel Weber carburettors, , .
:The V6 model, which was actually badged &quot;2.6&quot;, came in the top SX trim level, loaded with extras, but was not available with automatic transmission. The PRV engine used in the Tagora was different from the one used in contemporary Peugeot vehicles in that it was fitted with triple-barrel Weber carburettors rather than fuel injection, resulting in a higher power-rating. This made it the most powerful French car of its time. Nevertheless, only 1,083 V6 Tagora models were made.

The Tagora Présidence was a concept car designed by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in Whitley, Coventry. The concept was created to generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials. The donor model for the &quot;Présidence&quot; was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with Connolly Leather upholstery and brass highlights, plus a host of electronics including a telephone, dictaphone, text-message receiver, and television with VCR. Originally valued at £25,000, the Présidence now resides at a car museum in Poissy.

== Critical appraisal ==
The Tagora was not greeted with much acclaim by the British motoring press. &quot;Autocar&quot; reviewed the Tagora in its 2.2 litre GLS iteration, and summed it up as &quot;excellent, if not a great advance&quot;. L. J. K. Setright of &quot;Car&quot; magazine asked who could want one given the crowded market into which it came. Concluding a group test in &quot;Car&quot;, the Tagora was described as a &quot;problematic newcomer&quot; that did not exceed the standard set by the winner of the group test, the Volvo 244 GLE. However, &quot;Motor Sport&quot; considered the Tagora a &quot;usefully effortless, uncomplicated, simple-to-drive and very comfortable car&quot;.

The recurring theme of published tests was the Tagora&#x27;s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge. In comparing the car to its likely competitors, &quot;Autocar&quot;″s verdict was that &quot;the new Talbot is highly comparable with the others, and deserves to sell as any of them, although it does not come out with any startling advantages which you might expect of the latest appearance on the scene&quot;. Those cars against which the Tagora 2.2 GLS was compared were the Ford Granada 2.3 GL, Opel Rekord 2.0S, Renault 20TX, Rover 2300 and Volvo 244 GL. Of these cars, the Tagora was the second most expensive but did not have a superiority among the significant attributes of speed, acceleration, interior room or chassis design. Out of the comparison group the Tagora had the second highest top speed, was the third fastest to 60 mph though it had the best overall mpg (by 0.7 mpg). In terms of interior room, it had the fourth best legroom (front/rear). &quot;Motor Sport&quot; also noted the car&#x27;s modest competence in comparison with the Rover 2300 (launched 1976), saying that the Tagora had more leisurely acceleration. LJK Setright noted the cars&#x27;s overall &quot;adequacy&quot; going on to say that if fitted with the correct type of tyre he would still opt for a Peugeot 604 instead. &quot;Car&quot; judged the chassis design to be one area &quot;where [the Tagora] does not show the comparative youth of its design&quot;.

The Tagora&#x27;s handling was deemed &quot;on the good side&quot;, wrote &quot;Autocar&quot;, and performance was described as &quot;good but not outstanding&quot;. As such the car lay &quot;uneasily close to being listed as under-engined&quot; though the authors conceded that generally the Tagora did not feel under-engined when in use. LJK Setright dissented saying the Tagora was as &quot;refined in its ride as should be expected of it&quot; and that &quot;the car also has a good deal more road-holding and cornering than might be expected&quot;. However, in December 1981 &quot;Car&quot; magazine judged the car (2.2 GLS model) to be prone to &quot;untidy&quot; handling, tending to under-steer first followed by excessive over-steer. The magazine made a particular note of the advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by the older live-axled Volvo 244, underlining the point about the Tagora&#x27;s lack of advantage in terms of road manners.

Regarding the interior, the seats drew praise for their comfort and detail design. However, again, &quot;Car&quot; provided a counterpoint to the effect that the Volvo was as roomy, despite its shorter wheelbase. The steering wheel was criticized in the same review for being too close to the driver&#x27;s legs. The ventilation temperature control was &quot;not satisfactory&quot; due to an unprogressive response at the cool end of the dial. There was no fan-blown cold air (cold air was by ram-effect) nor an option for cool air to be directed to the face at the same time as warmth being directed into the footwells. According to &quot;Car&quot; the ventilation &quot;fell down badly&quot; on account of its awkward controls. Oddment accommodation was &quot;disappointment&quot;. Lacking a self-setting stay, opening the bonnet was &quot;heavy work&quot; and the boot, while large, had the demerit of an &quot;unusual&quot; locking method: &quot;[the boot] is locked &quot;before&quot; being shut by pushing in a red handle set in the inside of the lid&quot;.

In summary, the main competencies of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though it was not class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) and the size of its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.

Nearly a decade after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the automotive press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.

== Reasons for commercial failure ==

=== Market situation and image ===
In terms of engineering, the Tagora had no major flaws (except perhaps for the poor cabin ventilation). The 1979 energy crisis, however, dealt a blow to the European automotive market: the large car segment contracted significantly, making Chrysler&#x27;s initial sales projections unrealistic. The Tagora was ultimately launched under the Talbot brand, which was not established in the marketplace and had a confused pedigree, putting the car at an immediate disadvantage in an executive car market dominated by well established offerings such as the Ford Granada. In the view of Martin Buckley Talbot did not advertise the car effectively so &quot;people did not know about the car&quot;.

=== Design ===
As the British magazine &quot;What Car?&quot; opined, the Tagora &quot;has such a complete blandness of style as to disqualify it instantly in a market where character and status count for so much.&quot; The design of the Tagora was focused on practicality, providing exceptional cabin space at the expense of style. The steep windscreen formed a quite strange angle with the relatively short, wedge-shaped bonnet. The car was wider and taller than most of its competitors, and buyers were unaccustomed to such proportions. The PSA-sourced axles had very narrow tracks relative to the width of the body, which provided an awkward look, especially at the rear. Nor did the plain, plastic dashboard stir enthusiasm among reviewers and prospective customers.

<doc id="790139" wikidata="Q13405539" url="?curid=790139" title="Performance bond">
<text>A performance bond, also known as a contract bond, is a surety bond issued by an insurance company or a bank to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a contractor. The term is also used to denote a collateral deposit of good faith money, intended to secure a futures contract, commonly known as margin.

==History==
Performance bonds have been around since 2,750 BC. The Romans developed laws of surety around 150 AD, the principles of which still exist.

==Overview==
A job requiring a payment and performance bond will usually require a bid bond, submitted when bidding for the job. When the job is awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion. For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued in favour of a client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the contract (most often due to the bankruptcy of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond.

Performance bonds are commonly used in the construction and development of real property, where an owner or investor may require the developer to assure that contractors or project managers procure such bonds in order to guarantee that the value of the work will not be lost in the case of an unfortunate event (such as insolvency of the contractor). In other instances, a performance bond may be requested to be issued in other large contracts besides civil construction projects. Another example of this use is in commodity contracts where the seller is asked to provide a Bond to reassure the buyer that if the commodity being sold is not in fact delivered (for whatever reason) the buyer will at least receive compensation for his lost costs.

Performance bonds are generally issued as part of a &#x27;Performance and Payment Bond&#x27;, where a payment bond guarantees that the contractor will pay the labour and material costs they are obliged to.

===Performance bond cost===
Surety bond companies calculate the premium they charge for surety bonds based on three primary criteria: bond type, bond amount, and the applicant&#x27;s risk. Once the bond type, amount, and applicant risk are adequately assessed, a surety bond underwriter is able to assign an appropriate surety bond price.

===Bond type===
Surety bond companies have actuarial information on the lifetime claims history for each bond type. Over time, surety bond underwriters are able to determine that some surety bonds are more risky than others. For example, a California Motor Vehicle Dealer bond has significantly more claims than a straightforward notary bond. If a given surety bond type has paid out a high percentage of claims, then the premium amount paid by applicants will be higher.

===Applicant&#x27;s history/risk===
Surety bond companies attempt to predict the risk that an applicant represents. Those who are perceived to be a higher risk will pay a higher surety bond premium. Since surety bond companies are providing a financial guarantee on the future work performance of those who are bonded, they must have a clear picture of the individual&#x27;s history.

==In the United States==
In the United States, under the Miller Act of 1932, all construction contracts issued by the Federal Government with a value over $150,000 must be backed by performance and payment bonds. The Miller Act is now embodied in 40 USC chapter 31, subchapter III.

States have also enacted what are referred to as &quot;Little Miller Act&quot; statutes, requiring performance and payment bonds on State-funded projects.

Each bond has a designated bond amount. Surety bond companies will determine the bond rate based on risk and then charge a surety bond premium in the range 1-15% of the bond amount.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, performance bonds are commonly required for construction projects. These bonds provide financial security and peace of mind for all parties involved in the project, including the contractor, project owner, and suppliers. 

Performance bonds ensure that the contractor completes the project as specified in the contract. If they fail to do so, the obligee can make a claim against the bond to recover damages or losses incurred.

<text>Occupational hygiene or industrial hygiene (IH) is the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, control, and confirmation (ARECC) of protection from risks associated with exposures to hazards in, or arising from, the workplace that may result in injury, illness, impairment, or affect the well-being of workers and members of the community. These hazards or stressors are typically divided into the categories biological, chemical, physical, ergonomic and psychosocial. The risk of a health effect from a given stressor is a function of the hazard multiplied by the exposure to the individual or group. For chemicals, the hazard can be understood by the dose response profile most often based on toxicological studies or models. Occupational hygienists work closely with toxicologists (see Toxicology) for understanding chemical hazards, physicists (see Physics) for physical hazards, and physicians and microbiologists for biological hazards (see Microbiology, Tropical medicine, Infection). Environmental and occupational hygienists are considered experts in exposure science and exposure risk management. Depending on an individual&#x27;s type of job, a hygienist will apply their exposure science expertise for the protection of workers, consumers and/or communities.

== The profession of occupational hygienist ==
The British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) defines that &quot;occupational hygiene is about the prevention of ill-health from work, through recognizing, evaluating and controlling the risks&quot;. The International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA) refers to occupational hygiene as &quot;the discipline of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating and controlling health hazards in the working environment with the objective of protecting worker health and well-being and safeguarding the community at large.&quot; The term &quot;occupational hygiene&quot; (used in the UK and Commonwealth countries as well as much of Europe) is synonymous with &quot;industrial hygiene&quot; (used in the US, Latin America, and other countries that received initial technical support or training from US sources). The term &quot;industrial hygiene&quot; traditionally stems from industries with construction, mining or manufacturing, and &quot;occupational hygiene&quot; refers to all types of industry such as those listed for &quot;industrial hygiene&quot; as well as financial and support services industries and refers to &quot;work&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;place of work&quot; in general. &quot;Environmental hygiene&quot; addresses similar issues to &quot;occupational hygiene&quot; but is likely to be about broad industry or broad issues affecting the local community, broader society, region or country.

The profession of occupational hygiene uses strict and rigorous scientific methodology and often requires professional judgment based on experience and education in determining the potential for hazardous exposure risks in workplace and environmental studies. These aspects of occupational hygiene can often be referred to as the &quot;art&quot; of occupational hygiene and is used in a similar sense to the &quot;art&quot; of medicine. In fact &quot;occupational hygiene&quot; is both an aspect of preventive medicine and in particular occupational medicine, in that its goal is to prevent industrial disease, using the science of risk management, exposure assessment and industrial safety. Ultimately professionals seek to implement &quot;safe&quot; systems, procedures or methods to be applied in the workplace or to the environment. Prevention of exposure to long working hours has been identified as a focus for occupational hygiene when a landmark United Nations study estimated that this occupational hazard causes an estimated 745,000 occupational fatalities per year worldwide, the largest burden of disease attributed to any single occupational hazard.

&quot;Industrial hygiene&quot; refers to the science of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling workplaces to prevent illness or injuries to the workers. Industrial hygienists use various environmental monitoring and analytical methods to establish how workers are exposed. In turn, they employ techniques such as engineering and work practice controls to control any potential health hazards.

Anticipation involves identifying potential hazards in the workplace before they are introduced. The uncertainty of health hazards ranges from reasonable expectations to mere speculations. However, it implies that the industrial hygienist must understand the nature of changes in the processes, products, environments, and workforces of the workplaces and how they can affect workers&#x27; well-being.

Recognition of engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are the primary means of reducing the workers` exposure to occupational hazards. Timely recognition of hazards minimizes the workers&#x27; exposure to the hazards by removing or reducing the hazard&#x27;s source or isolating the workers from the hazards.

Evaluation of a worksite is a significant step that helps the industrial hygienists establish jobs and worksites that are a potential source of problems. During the evaluation, the industrial hygienist measures and identifies the problem tasks, exposures, and tasks. The most effective worksites assessment includes all the jobs, work activities, and operations. The industrial hygienists inspect research and evaluations of how given physical or chemical hazards affect the workers&#x27; health. If the workplace contains a health hazard, the industrial hygienist recommends appropriate corrective actions.

Control measures include removing toxic chemicals and replacing harmful toxic materials with less hazardous ones. It also involves confining work operations or enclosing work processes and installing general and local ventilation systems. Controls change how the task is performed. Some of the basic work practice controls include: following the laid procedures to reduce exposures while at the workplace, inspecting and maintaining processes regularly, and implementing reasonable workplace procedures.

==History==
The industrial hygiene profession gained respectability back in 1700 when Bernardino Ramazzini published a comprehensive book on industrial medicine. The book was written in Italian and was known as &quot;De Morbis Artificum Diatriba&quot;, meaning “The Diseases of Workmen”. The book detailed the accurate description of the occupational diseases that most of his time workers suffered from. Ramazzini was critical to the industrial hygiene profession&#x27;s future because he asserted that occupational diseases should be studied in the workplace environment and not in hospital wards. 

Industrial hygiene in the United States started taking shape in the early 20th century. There before, many workers risked their lives daily to work in industrial settings such as manufacturing, mills, constructions, and mines. Currently, the statistics on work safety are usually measured by the number of injuries and deaths yearly. Before the 20th century, these kinds of statistics were hard to come by because it appeared no one cared enough to make tracking of the job injuries and deaths a priority. 

Industrial hygiene received another boost in the early 20th century when Alice Hamilton led an effort to improve industrial hygiene. She began by observing industrial conditions first and then startled mine owners, factory managers, and other state officials with evidence that there was a correlation between workers&#x27; illnesses and their exposure to chemical toxins. She presented definitive proposals for eliminating unhealthful working conditions. As a result, the US federal government also began investigating health conditions in the industry. In 1911, the states passed the first workers&#x27; compensation laws.

==The social role of occupational hygiene==
Occupational hygienists have been involved historically with changing the perception of society about the nature and extent of hazards and preventing exposures in the workplace and communities. Many occupational hygienists work day-to-day with industrial situations that require control or improvement to the workplace situation. However larger social issues affecting whole industries have occurred in the past e.g. since 1900, asbestos exposures that have affected the lives of tens of thousands of people. Occupational hygienists have become more engaged in understanding and managing exposure risks to consumers from products with regulations such as REACh (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) enacted in 2006.

More recent issues affecting broader society are, for example in 1976, Legionnaires&#x27; disease or legionellosis. More recently again in the 1990s, radon, and in the 2000s, the effects of mold from indoor air quality situations in the home and at work. In the later part of the 2000s, concern has been raised about the health effects of nanoparticles.

Many of these issues have required the coordination of medical and paraprofessionals in detecting and then characterizing the nature of the issue, both in terms of the hazard and in terms of the risk to the workplace and ultimately to society. This has involved occupational hygienists in research, collection of data and development of suitable and satisfactory control methodologies.

==General activities==
The occupational hygienist may be involved with the assessment and control of physical, chemical, biological or environmental hazards in the workplace or community that could cause injury or disease. Physical hazards may include noise, temperature extremes, illumination extremes, ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, and ergonomics. Chemical hazards related to dangerous goods or hazardous substances are frequently investigated by occupational hygienists. Other related areas including indoor air quality (IAQ) and safety may also receive the attention of the occupational hygienist. Biological hazards may stem from the potential for legionella exposure at work or the investigation of biological injury or effects at work, such as dermatitis may be investigated.

As part of the investigation process, the occupational hygienist may be called upon to communicate effectively regarding the nature of the hazard, the potential for risk, and the appropriate methods of control. Appropriate controls are selected from the hierarchy of control: by elimination, substitution, engineering, administration and personal protective equipment (PPE) to control the hazard or eliminate the risk. Such controls may involve recommendations as simple as appropriate PPE such as a &#x27;basic&#x27; particulate dust mask to occasionally designing dust extraction ventilation systems, work places or management systems to manage people and programs for the preservation of health and well-being of those who enter a workplace.

Examples of occupational hygiene include:

* Analysis of physical hazards such as noise, which may require use of hearing protection earplugs and/or earmuffs to prevent hearing loss.
* Developing plans and procedures to protect against infectious disease exposure in the event of a flu pandemic.
* Monitoring the air for hazardous contaminants which may potentially lead to worker illness or death.

==Workplace assessment methods==
Although there are many aspects to occupational hygiene work the most known and sought after is in determining or estimating potential or actual exposures to hazards. For many chemicals and physical hazards, occupational exposure limits have been derived using toxicological, epidemiological and medical data allowing hygienists to reduce the risks of health effects by implementing the &quot;Hierarchy of Hazard Controls&quot;. Several methods can be applied in assessing the workplace or environment for exposure to a known or suspected hazard. Occupational hygienists do not rely on the accuracy of the equipment or method used but in knowing with certainty and precision the limits of the equipment or method being used and the error or variance given by using that particular equipment or method. Well known methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in the book &quot;A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures&quot;, published by AIHA Press.

The main steps outlined for assessing and managing occupational exposures:
* Basic Characterization (identify agents, hazards, people potentially exposed and existing exposure controls)
* Exposure Assessment (select occupational exposure limits, hazard bands, relevant toxicological data to determine if exposures are &quot;acceptable&quot;, &quot;unacceptable&quot; or &quot;uncertain&quot;)
* Exposure Controls (for &quot;unacceptable&quot; or &quot;uncertain&quot; exposures)
* Further Information Gathering (for &quot;uncertain&quot; exposures)
* Hazard Communication (for all exposures)
* Reassessment (as needed) / Management of Change
===Basic characterization, hazard identification and walk-through surveys===
The first step in understanding health risks related to exposures requires the collection of &quot;basic characterization&quot; information from available sources. A traditional method applied by occupational hygienists to initially survey a workplace or environment is used to determine both the types and possible exposures from hazards (e.g. noise, chemicals, radiation). The walk-through survey can be targeted or limited to particular hazards such as silica dust, or noise, to focus attention on control of all hazards to workers. A full walk-through survey is frequently used to provide information on establishing a framework for future investigations, prioritizing hazards, determining the requirements for measurement and establishing some immediate control of potential exposures. The Health Hazard Evaluation Program from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is an example of an industrial hygiene walk-through survey. Other sources of basic characterization information include worker interviews, observing exposure tasks, material safety data sheets, workforce scheduling, production data, equipment and maintenance schedules to identify potential exposure agents and people possibly exposed.

The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.

===Sampling===
An occupational hygienist may use one or a number of commercially available electronic measuring devices to measure noise, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, dust, solvents, gases, and so on. Each device is often specifically designed to measure a specific or particular type of contaminant. Electronic devices need to be calibrated before and after use to ensure the accuracy of the measurements taken and often require a system of certifying the precision of the instrument.

Collecting occupational exposure data is resource- and time-intensive, and can be used for different purposes, including evaluating compliance with government regulations and for planning preventive interventions. The usability of occupational exposure data is influenced by these factors:

* Data storage (e.g. use of electronic and centralized databases with retention of all records)
* Standardization of data collection
* Collaboration between researchers, safety and health professionals and insurers

In 2018, in an effort to standardize industrial hygiene data collection among workers compensation insurers and to determine the feasibility of pooling collected IH data, IH air and noise survey forms were collected. Data fields were evaluated for importance and a study list of core fields was developed, and submitted to an expert panel for review before finalization. The final core study list was compared to recommendations published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). Data fields essential to standardizing IH data collection were identified and verified. The &quot;essential&quot; data fields are available and could contribute to improved data quality and its management if incorporated into IH data management systems.

Canada and several European countries have been working to establish occupational exposure databases with standardized data elements and improved data quality. These databases include MEGA, COLCHIC, and CWED.

====Dust sampling====

Nuisance dust is considered to be the total dust in air including inhalable and respirable fractions.

Various dust sampling methods exist that are internationally recognised. Inhalable dust is determined using the modern equivalent of the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) MRE 113A monitor. Inhalable dust is considered to be dust of less than 100 micrometers aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED) that enters through the nose and or mouth.

Respirable dust is sampled using a cyclone dust sampler design to sample for a specific fraction of dust AED at a set flow rate. The respirable dust fraction is dust that enters the &#x27;deep lung&#x27; and is considered to be less than 10 micrometers AED.

Nuisance, inhalable and respirable dust fractions are all sampled using a constant volumetric pump for a specific sampling period. By knowing the mass of the sample collected and the volume of air sampled, a concentration for the fraction sampled can be given in milligrams (mg) per meter cubed (m3). From such samples, the amount of inhalable or respirable dust can be determined and compared to the relevant occupational exposure limits.

By use of inhalable, respirable or other suitable sampler (7 hole, 5 hole, etc.), these dust sampling methods can also used to determine metal exposure in the air. This requires collection of the sample on a methyl cellulose ester (MCE) filter and acid digestion of the collection media in the laboratory followed by measuring metal concentration through atomic absorption spectroscopy or atomic emission spectroscopy. Both the UK Health and Safety Laboratory and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods have specific methodologies for a broad range of metals in air found in industrial processing (smelting, foundries, etc.).

A further method exists for the determination of asbestos, fiberglass, synthetic mineral fiber and ceramic mineral fiber dust in air. This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires the collection of the dust on a gridded filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of &#x27;conforming&#x27; fibers in 100 fields through a microscope. Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibers per milliliter of air (f/mL). Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.

====Chemical sampling====
Two types of chemically absorbent tubes are used to sample for a wide range of chemical substances. Traditionally a chemical absorbent &#x27;tube&#x27; (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10 mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lipophilic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period. The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lipophilic material absorbs non water-soluble materials. The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatography or mass spectrometry methods. These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable for a wide range of potential contaminates. However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time-consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis. A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1 kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.

In the last few decades, advances have been made in &#x27;passive&#x27; badge technology. These samplers can now be purchased to measure one chemical (e.g. formaldehyde) or a chemical type (e.g. ketones) or a broad spectrum of chemicals (e.g. solvents). They are relatively easy to set up and use. However, considerable cost can still be incurred in analysis of the &#x27;badge&#x27;. They weigh 20 to 30 grams and workers do not complain about their presence. Unfortunately &#x27;badges&#x27; may not exist for all types of workplace sampling that may be required, and the charcoal or silica method may sometimes have to be applied.

From the sampling method, results are expressed in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) or parts per million (PPM) and compared to the relevant occupational exposure limits.

It is a critical part of the exposure determination that the method of sampling for the specific contaminate exposure is directly linked to the exposure standard used. Many countries regulate both the exposure standard, the method used to determine the exposure and the methods to be used for chemical or other analysis of the samples collected.

==== Noise sampling ====
Two types of noise are environmental noise, which is unwanted sound that occurs outdoors, and occupational noise, the sound that is received by employees while they are in the workplace. Environmental noise can originate from various sources depending on the activity, location, and time. Environmental noise can be generated from transportation such as road, rail, and air traffic, or construction and building services, and even domestic and leisure activities.

There is a legal limit on noise that the environmental noise is 70 dB(A) over 24 hours of average exposure. Similarly, the limit of occupational noise is 85 dB(A) per NIOSH, or 90 dB(A) per OSHA for an 8-hour work period. In order to enforce these limits, these are the methods to measure noise, including sound level meter (SLM), Sound Level Meter App, integrating sound level meter (ISLM), impulse sound level meter (Impulse SLM), noise dosimeter, and personal sound exposure meter (PSEM).

* Sound level meter (SLM): measures the sound level at a single point of time and consequently requires multiple measurements to be taken at different times of the day. The SLM is primarily used for measuring relatively stable sound levels; there is increased difficulty in measuring the average sound exposure if the noise levels vary greatly.
* Sound Level Meter App is a program that can be downloaded to a mobile device. It receives noise through the phone&#x27;s built-in or external microphone and displays the sound level measurement from the app&#x27;s sound level meters and noise dosimeters.
* Integrating sound level meter (ISLM): measures the equivalent sound levels within the measurement period. Because the ISLM measures noise in a particular area, it is difficult to measure a worker&#x27;s personal exposure as they move throughout a workspace.
* Impulse sound level meter (Impulse SLM): measures the peak of each sound impulse. The most optimal conditions to measure the peaks occur when there is little background noise.
* Noise dosimeter: collects the sound level for a given point in time, as well as different sound levels across time. The noise dosimeter can measure personal exposure levels and can be used in the areas with a high risk of fire.
* Personal sound exposure meter (PSEM): worn by employees while they work. The advantage of the PSEM is that it eliminates the need for noise assessors to follow up with workers when the assessors measure the noise levels of the work areas.

Excessive noise can lead to occupational hearing loss. 12% of workers report having hearing difficulties, making this the third most common chronic disease in the U.S. Among these workers, 24% have hearing difficulties caused by occupational noise, with 8% affected by tinnitus, and 4% having both hearing difficulties and tinnitus.

Ototoxic chemicals including solvents, metals, compounds, asphyxiants, nitriles, and pharmaceuticals, may contribute further to hearing loss.

===Exposure management and controls===
The hierarchy of control defines the approach used to reduce exposure risks protecting workers and communities. These methods include elimination, substitution, engineering controls (isolation or ventilation), administrative controls and personal protective equipment. Occupational hygienists, engineers, maintenance, management and employees should all be consulted for selecting and designing the most effective and efficient controls based on the hierarchy of control.

==Professional societies==
The development of industrial hygiene societies originated in the United States, beginning with the first convening of members for the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in 1938, and the formation of the American Industrial Hygiene Association in 1939. In the United Kingdom, the British Occupational Hygiene Society started in 1953. Through the years, professional occupational societies have formed in many different countries, leading to the formation of the International Occupational Hygiene Association in 1987, in order to promote and develop occupational hygiene worldwide through the member organizations. The IOHA has grown to 29 member organizations, representing over 20,000 occupational hygienists worldwide, with representation from countries present in every continent.

==Peer-reviewed literature==
There are several academic journals specifically focused on publishing studies and research in the occupational health field. The &quot;Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene&quot; (JOEH) has been published jointly since 2004 by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, replacing the former &quot;American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal&quot; and &quot;Applied Occupational &amp; Environmental Hygiene&quot; journals. Another seminal occupational hygiene journal would be &quot;The Annals of Occupational Hygiene,&quot; published by the British Occupational Hygiene Society since 1958. Further, NIOSH maintains a searchable bibliographic database (NIOSHTIC-2) of occupational safety and health publications, documents, grant reports, and other communication products.
==Occupational hygiene as a career==
Examples of occupational hygiene careers include:
* Compliance officer on behalf of regulatory agency
* Professional working on behalf of company for the protection of the workforce
* Consultant working on behalf of companies
* Researcher performing laboratory or field occupational hygiene work

=== Education ===
The basis of the technical knowledge of occupational hygiene is from competent training in the following areas of science and management:
* Basic sciences (biology, chemistry, mathematics (statistics), physics)
* Occupational diseases (illness, injury and health surveillance (biostatistics, epidemiology, toxicology))
* Health hazards (biological, chemical and physical hazards, ergonomics and human factors)
* Working environments (mining, industrial, manufacturing, transport and storage, service industries and offices)
* Programme management principles (professional and business ethics, work site and incident investigation methods, exposure guidelines, occupational exposure limits, jurisdictional based regulations, hazard identification, risk assessment and risk communication, data management, fire evacuation and other emergency responses)
* Sampling, measurement and evaluation practices (instrumentation, sampling protocols, methods or techniques, analytical chemistry)
* Hazard controls (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE and air conditioning and extraction ventilation)
* Environment (air pollution, hazardous waste)
However, it is not rote knowledge that identifies a competent occupational hygienist. There is an &quot;art&quot; to applying the technical principles in a manner that provides a reasonable solution for workplace and environmental issues. In effect an experienced &quot;mentor&quot;, who has experience in occupational hygiene is required to show a new occupational hygienist how to apply the learned scientific and management knowledge in the workplace and to the environment issue to satisfactorily resolve the problem.

To be a professional occupational hygienist, experience in as wide a practice as possible is required to demonstrate knowledge in areas of occupational hygiene. This is difficult for &quot;specialists&quot; or those who practice in narrow subject areas. Limiting experience to individual subject like asbestos remediation, confined spaces, indoor air quality, or lead abatement, or learning only through a textbook or “review course” can be a disadvantage when required to demonstrate competence in other areas of occupational hygiene.

Information presented in Wikipedia can be considered to be only an outline of the requirements for professional occupational hygiene training. This is because the actual requirements in any country, state or region may vary due to educational resources available, industry demand or regulatory mandated requirements.

During 2010, the Occupational Hygiene Training Association (OHTA) through sponsorship provided by the IOHA initiated a training scheme for those with an interest in or those requiring training in occupational hygiene. These training modules can be downloaded and used freely. The available subject modules (Basic Principles in Occupational Hygiene, Health Effects of Hazardous Substances, Measurement of Hazardous Substances, Thermal Environment, Noise, Asbestos, Control, Ergonomics) are aimed at the ‘foundation’ and ‘intermediate’ levels in occupational hygiene. Although the modules can be used freely without supervision, attendance at an accredited training course is encouraged. These training modules are available from ohtatraining.org

Academic programs offering industrial hygiene bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees in United States may apply to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) to have their program accredited. As of October 1, 2006, 27 institutions have accredited their industrial hygiene programs. Accreditation is not available for doctoral programs.

In the U.S., the training of IH professionals is supported by NIOSH through their NIOSH Education and Research Centers.

===Professional credentials===
====Australia====
In 2005, the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygiene (AIOH) accredited professional occupational hygienists through a certification scheme. Occupational Hygienists in Australia certified through this scheme are entitled to use the phrase Certified Occupational Hygienist (COH) as part of their qualifications.

====Hong Kong====
Registered Professional Hygienist Registration &amp; Examination Board (RPH R&amp;EB) is set up by the Council of the Hong Kong Institute of Occupational &amp; Environmental Hygiene (HKIOEH) with an aim to enhance the professional development of occupational hygienists and to provide a path for persons who reach professional maturity in the field of occupational hygiene to obtain qualification recognised by peer professionals. Under HKIOEH, RPH R&amp;EB operates the registration program of Registered Professional Hygienist (RPH) and qualifying examination in a standard meeting the practice as recognised by the National Accreditation Recognition (NAR) Committee of the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA).

====Saudi Arabia====
The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health&#x27;s Occupational Health Directorate and Labor Office are the government agencies responsible for decisions and surveillance related to occupational hygiene. Professional occupational hygiene and safety education programs surveilled under these offices are available through Saudi Arabian colleges.

====United States====
Practitioners who successfully meet specific education and work-experience requirements and pass a written examination administered by the Board for Global EHS Credentialing (BGC) are authorized to use the term Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) or the discontinued Certified Associate Industrial Hygienist (CAIH). Both of these terms have been codified into law in many states in the United States to identify minimum qualifications of individuals having oversight over certain activities that may affect employee and general public health.

After the initial certification, the CIH or CAIH maintains their certification by meeting on-going requirements for ethical behavior, education, and professional activities (e.g., active practice, technical committees, publishing, teaching).

Certification examinations are offered during a spring and fall testing window each year worldwide.

The CIH designation is the most well known and recognized industrial hygiene designation throughout the world. There are approximately 6800 CIHs in the world making BGC the largest industrial hygiene certification organization. The CAIH certification program was discontinued in 2006. Those who were certified as a CAIH retain their certification through ongoing certification maintenance. People who are currently certified by BGC can be found in a public roster.

The BGC is a recognized certification board by the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA). The CIH certification has been accredited internationally by the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC 17024). In the United States, the CIH has been accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB).

====Canada====
In Canada, a practitioner who successfully completes a written test and an interview administered by the Canadian Registration Board of Occupational Hygienists can be recognized as a Registered Occupational Hygienist (ROH) or Registered Occupational Hygiene Technician (ROHT). There is also designation to be recognized as a Canadian Registered Safety Professional (CRSP).

====United Kingdom====
The Faculty of Occupational Hygiene, part of the British Occupational Hygiene Society, represents the interests of professional occupational hygienists.

Membership of the Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is confined to BOHS members who hold a recognized professional qualification in occupational hygiene.

There are three grades of Faculty membership:
* Licentiate (LFOH) holders will have obtained the BOHS Certificate of Operational Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least three years’ practical experience in the field.
* Members (MFOH) are normally holders of the Diploma of Professional Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least five years’ experience at a senior level.
* Fellows (FFOH) are senior members of the profession who have made a distinct contribution to the advancement of occupational hygiene.

All Faculty members participate in a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) scheme designed to maintain a high level of current awareness and knowledge in occupational hygiene.

====India====
The Indian Society of Industrial Hygiene was formed in 1981 at Chennai, India. Subsequently, its secretariat was shifted to Kanpur. The society has registered about 400 members, about 90 of whom are life members. The society publishes a newsletter, &quot;Industrial Hygiene Link&quot;. The secretary of the society is Shyam Singh Gautam.

<text>The Gulf of Corinth or the Corinthian Gulf (, ) is a deep inlet of the Ionian Sea, separating the Peloponnese from western mainland Greece. It is bounded in the east by the Isthmus of Corinth which includes the shipping-designed Corinth Canal and in the west by the Rion Strait which widens into the shorter Gulf of Patras (part of the Ionian Sea) and of which the narrowest point is crossed since 2004 by the Rio–Antirrio bridge. The gulf is bordered by the large administrative divisions (regional units): Aetolia-Acarnania and Phocis in the north, Boeotia in the northeast, Attica in the east, Corinthia in the southeast and south and Achaea in the southwest. The tectonic movement across the gulf is comparable to parts of Iceland and Turkey, growing by per year.

In the Middle Ages, the gulf was known as the Gulf of Lepanto (the Italian form of Naupactus).

Shipping routes between the Greek commercial port Piraeus (further away from ultimate destinations but larger and better connected to the south than the north-western Greek port of Igoumenitsa) to western Mediterranean and hemisphere ports pass along this gulf. A ferry crosses the gulf to link Aigio and Agios Nikolaos, towards the western part of the gulf.

==Geology==
The gulf was created by the expansion of a tectonic rift due to the westward movement of the Anatolian Plate, and expands by per year. The surrounding faults can produce earthquakes up to magnitude around 6.5, though they are relatively uncommon. On June 15, 1995, an earthquake of magnitude 6.2 occurred near the city of Aigion. A large part of the northern margin of the gulf is characterized by gentle gradients (between 10 and 20 degrees). The southern margin of the gulf is largely characterized by steep gradients (between 30 and 40 degrees).

==Nature==

Cetaceans such as fin whales or dolphins are known to enter the Corinthian gulf occasionally.

<text>Mário Coelho Pinto de Andrade (21 August 1928 – 26 August 1990) was an Angolan poet and politician.

==Biography==
He was born in Golungo Alto, in Portuguese Angola, and studied philosophy at the University of Lisbon and sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris. While there, he became active in opposing Portuguese colonial rule of Angola, and wrote anti-colonial poetry.

In 1955, he took part in the founding of the Angolan Communist Party. In 1956, he was the founder of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and was elected its first President in 1960. His brother, Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, was made the MPLA&#x27;s first honorary President.

He married the French filmmaker Sarah Maldoror and worked with her on &quot;Sambizanga&quot;, a 1972 film about the Angolan liberation movement. (Sarah and Mário would go on to have two daughters, Henda Ducados Pinto de Andrade and Annouchka de Andrade.)

He clashed with his successor, Agostinho Neto, and in 1974 founded within the MPLA a group called &quot;Revolta Activa&quot; (Active Revolt). Angola became independent on November 11, 1975, but Andrade continued to live in exile in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Mozambique. He died in London in 1990.

His publications included the anthologies &quot;Letteratura Negra&quot; (1961) and &quot;La Poésie Africaine d&#x27;Espression Portugaise&quot; (1969).

<text>Swansea Jack (1930 – October 1937) was a British dog who rescued 27 people from the docks and riverbanks of Swansea, Wales.

== Life ==

Swansea Jack was a black retriever with a longish coat. He was similar in appearance to a modern Flat-Coated Retriever, but was instead identified at the time as a Newfoundland dog, despite being considerably smaller and lighter in build than the typical modern Newfoundland dog, possibly because he was reported to have been born in Newfoundland. Originally owned by Taulford Davies, he was rehomed by a new owner, William Thomas, where he then lived in the North Dock/River Tawe area of Swansea. Jack would always respond to cries for help from the water, diving into the water and pulling whoever was in difficulty to safety at the dockside.

His first rescue, in June 1931, when he saved a 12-year-old boy, went unreported. A few weeks later, this time in front of a crowd, Jack rescued a swimmer from the docks. His photograph appeared in the local paper and the local council awarded him a silver collar. In 1936 he had the prestigious &#x27;Bravest Dog of the Year&#x27; award bestowed upon him by the &quot;Star&quot; newspaper in London.

He received a silver cup from the Lord Mayor of London and he is still the only dog to have been awarded two bronze medals by the National Canine Defence League (now known as Dogs Trust). Legend has it that in his lifetime he saved 27 people from the Docks / River Tawe. 

==Death and legacy==
Swansea Jack died on 2 October 1937 after eating rat poison; it is not known whether this was accidental or intentional. His death was reported by the press across the UK and the press claimed he had saved 29 lives (for example, &quot;Nottingham Journal&quot; 5 October 1937).

His burial monument, paid for by public subscription, is located on the Promenade in Swansea near St Helen&#x27;s Rugby Ground. In 2000, Swansea Jack was named &#x27;Dog of the Century&#x27; by NewFound Friends of Bristol who train domestic dogs in aquatic rescue techniques.

<doc id="790194" wikidata="Q5304690" url="?curid=790194" title="Dracula (Castlevania)">
<text>or simply known as , real name Mathias Cronqvist, is a fictional character from the &quot;Castlevania&quot; video game series created by Konami. A vampire and a sorcerer, he is the main antagonist of the series, the archenemy of the Belmont clan, and the final boss of almost every installment. In the series reboot &quot;&quot;, Dracula is reimagined as an 11th-century holy knight named Gabriel Belmont and serves as the central character of the game and its two sequels. The &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series tells the story of Gabriel&#x27;s quest to save the world, vampirism and redemption.

The Dracula of &quot;Castlevania&quot; is based on Bram Stoker&#x27;s character from the novel of the same name, who was in turn likely named for Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia. The Dracula of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series draws inspiration from both, but instead of only preying on victims, this version threatens the whole world and the human race. Nevertheless, further games explore a sign of humanity in the form of his love towards his wife, who had a child named Alucard with him. Dracula was created by game director Hitoshi Akamatsu, who was fond of horror films when creating the &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise. Koji Igarashi further expanded on his character, starting with &quot;Castlevania: Symphony of the Night&quot;. Meanwhile, the reboot by Mercury Steam was meant to show the character as more sympathetic in his transformation from a vampire hunter to Dracula.

Critical response to Dracula has been largely positive, establishing him as one of the most iconic video game villains. His portrayal in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; trilogy received mixed reviews from game journalists, who praised the tragic elements of his story in the first two games. However, his characterization as Dracula was criticized for being too contrived. Meanwhile, his appearance in the Netflix animated series was received positively for coming across as more human, despite being a villain.

==Conception and design==
===Original concept by Konami===

The &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise heavily references the horror films produced by Universal Pictures and Hammer Film Productions. Creator of the series, Hitoshi Akamatsu, wanted players to feel like they were in a classic horror film. They started with the concept of &quot;we wanted to make a Dracula game&quot; and since the image of a vampire is strongly associated with Dracula, moreso than any other vampire, they believed he was the most suitable adversary for Simon Belmont. Akamatsu then bought various books related to vampires and Dracula and the history of Europe in order to further expand on the original idea. While he personally did not have any particular attachment to vampires, he found their power to revive as many times as possible, despite their weaknesses, was charming.

In the first &quot;Castlevania&quot;, Dracula&#x27;s decapitation foreshadows his revival in the sequel. When the body parts scatter in every direction, this was also meant to show that Dracula will come back. The second monstrous form the player fight was meant to be an &quot;incarnation of the curse of man&quot;, and not Dracula himself. That is why when Simon defeats him, he gets cursed. Akamatsu also explained the rotating gears in Dracula&#x27;s castle only turn so long as Dracula is alive. That is why only the clock tower collapses in &quot;Castlevania&quot;&#x27;s ending, but the rest of the castle remains standing, which Akamatsu said hinted towards a sequel. This also references cliffhangers from horror films.

Koji Igarashi became one of the most common producers behind &quot;Castlevania&quot; following the sequel &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. Dracula&#x27;s son, Alucard, was chosen as the protagonist for the installment, not only because of his relationship with Dracula, but also because of the new designs provided. Their last fight in the game places special emphasis on humanity, highlighted through Alucard&#x27;s dialogue, where he reminds Dracula of his wife, Lisa. Dracula&#x27;s recurring presence in all the &quot;Castlevania&quot; games led to the decision to introduce his reincarnation, Soma Cruz, in &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;. This character development marked a significant shift in the character&#x27;s direction.

===Alternative portrayals===

For the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series, in which Dracula is playable, his design was influenced by his voice actor Robert Carlyle. Producer Dave Cox said that thanks to Carlyle&#x27;s input, Gabriel&#x27;s design was changed more. Cox used Tony Soprano from the television drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as an example in regards to Dracula&#x27;s characterization. By &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;, Dracula starts questioning his actions. Hideo Kojima&#x27;s input included advising Cox&#x27;s team to redesign some of the lead character, Gabriel, who he felt needed a &quot;more heroic face&quot;. Originally, Gabriel&#x27;s design resembled a classic barbarian, before Kojima then advised the staff to refine him into a character that was more relatable for the player. Cox mentioned that the voice acting provided by Robert Carlyle helped humanize Gabriel&#x27;s character.

For &quot;Lords of Shadow Mirror of Fate&quot;, Alucard&#x27;s human form, Trevor Belmont, was created in a parallel with Gabriel. MercurySteam had more freedom with this game, resulting in connections between the Belmont and Dracula. Despite being Dracula&#x27;s child, Alucard was designed with the idea of being his opposite, fighting on the side of good. The staff wanted Trevor to stand out and not look identical to Gabriel. The themes of fate and parallels between the bloodlines involving Alucard and Dracula was inspired by Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movie, &quot;Memento&quot; (2000). The powers Alucard has access in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; reboot were loosely based on &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. The wolf transformation in particular was used to assist Dracula in latter parts from the third game.

For &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;, Gabriel had turned into Dracula which was the main focus of the game as it was the first time a mainline &quot;Castlevania&quot; title made him playabale. This led to new forms of combat not seen before in the franchise, and the player gets stronger in order to make Dracula powerful enough to kill Satan, the reboot&#x27;s antagonist. The scene were Dracula kills a family member was meant to be harsh: &quot;He&#x27;s an evil man, who does evil things, but you can identify with him, you can feel sorry for him&quot; according to Cox, who said that this scene was meant to contrast Gabriel with Bela Lugosi&#x27;s take on Dracula as well as previous incarnations in the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series. In other scenes when talking to Trevor, Dracula still shows love for his child. Mercury tried to portray him as a real person, which was Robert Carlyle&#x27;s contribution. Carlyle said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to portray him as constantly evil or angry. &quot;He certainly gets angry in the game, but he&#x27;s determined, soft spoken most of the time. We wanted to portray him as a real character.&quot; Other actors were considered for the role of Dracula, but the staff very quickly realized they wanted Carlyle when they started working with him.

When Netflix created an animated series based on the franchise, director Adam Deats wanted to focus on Dracula&#x27;s humanity by showing his transformation into a villain with the death of his wife, Lisa. &quot;By giving Dracula the human dimension that he really has to have to make the story sustainable, you have to find the human element in him&quot;. As a result the staff does not consider this Dracula evil. Warren Ellis&#x27; writing was praised by the staff as he has an &quot;instinct for creating that human dimension for a character that makes you want to spend time with them even if what they ultimately do is not something that you&#x27;re supportive of&quot;.

==Appearances==

Dracula first appeared in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot;, set in the year 1691. Simon Belmont ventures into Dracula&#x27;s castle to defeat him. The plot of &quot;Castlevania&quot; was re-used in the games &quot;Vampire Killer&quot;, &quot;Haunted Castle&quot;, &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot; and &quot;Castlevania Chronicles&quot;. In the manual of the second game, &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;, it is revealed that, in his dying moments at the end of the first game, Dracula placed a curse on Simon, which condemned him to slowly die from his injuries. In 1698, Simon sets out to gather Dracula&#x27;s scattered body parts and use them to resurrect Dracula in the ruins of his castle, where he defeats him. In Hitoshi Akamatsu&#x27;s last game, the prequel &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, Dracula unleashes his army of monsters on Europe in 1476.

In &quot;Castlevania II: Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, it is revealed that Dracula escaped and survived until 1591, when he kidnapped Christopher&#x27;s son Soleil and tried to turn him against his father. Christopher defeats Dracula again and saves his son. &quot;&quot; takes place in 1792 and stars a new Belmont named Richter. This was the first game in the series to use substantial voice acting to further the narrative. Dracula is resurrected by a cult led by a dark priest named Shaft. He proceeds to kidnap several villagers, including Richter&#x27;s girlfriend Annette and a child named Maria Renard. In the &quot;best&quot; ending of the game, Richter saves all the kidnapped women and defeats Dracula.

&quot;&quot;, stars Dracula&#x27;s son Alucard who enters the castle five years after Richter&#x27;s victory. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; introduced the character of Lisa, Alucard&#x27;s mother and Dracula&#x27;s wife who had been falsely executed on charges of witchcraft centuries prior, leaving Dracula grief stricken. Alucard discovers that Shaft had placed Richter under a dark spell, the plan being that Richter could defeat all other enemies of Dracula. Alucard then defeats Shaft, saves Richter, and faces his resurrected father. They exchange words before Alucard kills him, telling him Lisa&#x27;s last words: &quot;Do not hate humans. If you cannot live with them, then at least do them no harm, for theirs is already a hard lot&quot;. Dracula cries out for Lisa&#x27;s forgiveness as he returns to the abyss.

&quot;&quot; is set in 1917. The protagonists are John Morris and Eric Lecarde. This game introduced Dracula&#x27;s niece, Elizabeth Bartley, named for Elizabeth Báthory. It was implied that Bartley arranged the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in order to precipitate World War I. She resurrects Dracula, but she and her uncle are defeated by John and Eric. &quot;Castlevania&quot; (1999) and &quot;&quot; take place in the mid-19th century. In these games, Dracula&#x27;s return is accomplished through the unusual method of having him reincarnated as a child named Malus.

Set in 1830, &quot;&quot; explains how Dracula was defeated by vampire hunter Morris Baldwin a decade prior. At the start of the game, Dracula is resurrected by his disciple Camilla. The player assumes the role of Nathan Graves, a student of Morris Baldwin, who once again defeats the newly resurrected Dracula.

&quot;&quot; takes place in 1748. Simon&#x27;s grandson Juste is the main character. He enters Castlevania to save his childhood friend Lydie Erlanger. Their friend Maxim Kischine resurrected Dracula in order to prove his worth as a vampire hunter and Dracula is defeated by Juste.

The prequel &quot;&quot; takes place in 1094. The game introduced Crusaders Leon Belmont and Mathias Cronqvist. In 1093, they returned from a campaign to find that Mathias&#x27; wife Elisabetha had died. A year later, Leon&#x27;s fiancée Sara disappears. Mathias tells Leon that she was kidnapped by a vampire named Walter Bernhard, who lives in a castle in the Forest of Eternal Night. Leon forsakes his title and arms in order to venture into the castle and save Sara. He is given a weapon known as the Whip of Alchemy. Leon eventually rescues Sara, but she is already infected with the vampire&#x27;s curse. She sacrifices her soul to imbue the Whip of Alchemy with the power to destroy Walter. Leon returns to the castle and defeats Walter. Mathias then appears and reveals that he orchestrated the entire scheme in order to gain possession of the Crimson Stone. Mathias blamed God for Elisabetha&#x27;s death, and plans to revenge himself upon God by becoming immortal. He offers Leon the chance to join him in eternal life. Leon refuses. Disappointed, Mathias escapes, leaving Leon to battle his second in command, Death. Series producer Koji Igarashi has confirmed that Mathias eventually becomes Dracula.

&quot;&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Castlevania III&quot;, taking place in 1479. The main character is Hector, a &quot;Devil Forgemaster&quot; who served Dracula but left his service just prior to his defeat at the hands of Trevor. With his dying words, Dracula places a curse upon the land. Hector plans to live peacefully amongst humans, but his wife Rosalie is executed for witchcraft at the behest of fellow Forgemaster Isaac. Hector swears revenge upon Isaac, but this is a ploy; Isaac intends to use Hector as the vessel for Dracula&#x27;s return. Hector defeats Isaac, who himself becomes the vessel. Hector then faces Dracula, defeats him, and used his powers to dispel the curse.

In this game, Dracula&#x27;s castle is resurrected by vampire artist Brauner during World War II. At the end of this game, Dracula takes the unusual step of fighting alongside Death, before fusing with Death and morphing into a final, demonic form.

&quot;&quot; is set in the 1800s and features a holy order named Ecclesia which had apparently created a power named Dominus with the ability to defeat Dracula. However, Dominus is actually constructed from Dracula&#x27;s own power, and the Order made Dominus to break the seal on the casket imprisoning his soul, as their leader Barlowe believed Dracula&#x27;s return was secretly mankind&#x27;s greatest desire. Ecclesia&#x27;s chief researcher Albus had stolen the Dominus glyph in an attempt to protect the main character, Shanoa, who had been raised as his younger sister, but became possessed by Dracula when he absorbed one part of the glyph. After Dracula&#x27;s resurrection, Shanoa faces and defeats him.

=== &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series ===
MercurySteam produced also the reboot, &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot;, with the first game, &quot;&quot;. It starred Gabriel Belemont, Dracula&#x27;s original human form. Gabriel is sent by the Brotherhood of Light to the Lake of Oblivion, where his deceased wife, Marie, tells him that Spirits who founded the Brotherhood said that the Lords of Shadow&#x27;s power will save the world. Gabriel meets a man from the Brotherhood called Zobek, who states that a prophecy has been kept a secret by a select few, which tells of a pure-hearted warrior who will claim the Lords of Shadow&#x27;s power to overcome evil. In the climax, Zobek discloses he used the Devil Mask on Gabriel to kill Marie and that all he needed was for Gabriel to restore the power of the Spirits to avoid suspicion from them. Satan emerges and takes the God Mask, revealing himself as the mastermind who gave Zobek his powers so that Satan could have revenge on God and return to the Heavens. Gabriel confronts Satan and defeats him, releasing souls of the deceased from limbo. Gabriel discovers the God Mask cannot bring Marie back and that it only allows him to see through God&#x27;s eyes. The epilogue reveals that in modern times Gabriel has become a vampire who identifies himself by saying &quot;Eu sunt Dracul&quot; in Romanian which can roughly translate to &quot;I am the Dragon&quot;, &quot;I am the Devil&quot; or more popularly &quot;I am Dracula&quot;. Zobek finds Dracula hiding in a ruined church and tries to win his support against the acolytes of Satan. Zobek tells him he will free him of his immortality if he helps him. It is explained through the game&#x27;s two DLC Packages Reverie and Resurrection that after the defeat of the Lords of Shadow, a powerful demon they locked away called the Forgotten One had begun to break free. In order to enter the demon&#x27;s prison dimension Gabriel, somewhat reluctantly allowed himself to be turned into a vampire followed by defeating the demon by absorbing its power and killing it in a single blow, completely sacrificing his humanity in the process. During &quot;Resurrection&quot;, the Forgotten One aspires to destroy the humans&#x27; world, but he is defeated by Gabriel who claims his power for himself. Corrupted by the Forgotten One&#x27;s power, Gabriel destroys his Combat Cross and leaves through the portal.

In &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot; Gabriel returns as Dracula. His goal is to destroy the Brotherhood of Light in order to &quot;remake&quot; the world, as he believes the Brotherhood is evil and corrupt, as the Brotherhood manipulated him and allowed his wife to be killed when they could have prevented it. The brotherhood believed Gabriel was the chosen one, and would redeem mankind. The Brotherhood however knew of his descent into darkness so they raised his son, Trevor, kept from him in secret by Marie, as a member of the brotherhood in order to combat his father. Later Trevor tracks down his father and attempt to avenge the death of his mother. While dying, Trevor looks into the Mirror of Fate and sees what actually happened to Gabriel. After looking into the mirror and learning the truth, Dracula panics and desperately attempts to revive him by giving him his own blood. After it does not seem to work, he puts Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard as he never knew his son&#x27;s true name. Dracula faces his son, now revived, and his grandson Simon. The end of the battle sees him disappear and Alucard says that is not how a vampire is supposed to die.

In &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;, Dracula faces several people opposing him until seeing his son again. The story then moves to modern times in the first &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; cliffhanger where a weakened Dracula feeds on a family to recover his health. He is warned by Zobek of the return of Satan, who until then was deterred from doing so by Dracula himself. Zobek offers him his old weapon, the Vampire Killer, the only relic capable of ending his cursed existence, in exchange for him vanquishing the &quot;acolytes&quot; trying to bring Satan back. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle, which the cursed blood that kept it alive for centuries attempts to deter Dracula of his quest. Throughout his journey, Dracula is aided by various allies, including Zobek&#x27;s bodyguard and specters of his deceased wife Marie and a younger Trevor. He also encounters the Brotherhood of Light and its current leader, Victor Belmont. After destroying two of the acolytes and tracked down the third, Dracula is confronted by Zobek&#x27;s bodyguard, Alucard in disguise. It is revealed that centuries ago, Alucard had come to Dracula with a plan to destroy both Zobek and Satan, using his sword, the Crissaegrim, on him to induce a deep sleep and thus setting the current events into motion. Zobek discovers their treachery and confronts them both. Dracula kills him just as the third acolyte summons Satan. Dracula and Alucard are able to kill the beast, only for Satan to possess the latter, forcing father and son to battle. Dracula kills Satan once and for all while saving his son. Dracula then destroys the Mirror of Fate and leaves the streets with his son.

===In other media===
Dracula appears as a recurring villain in the 1989 animated series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. He is never referred to by name, only being addressed as &quot;The Count&quot;. He is depicted as a lanky vampire in a yellow suit, later changed to black and blue in the show&#x27;s third season. He seeks to terrorize the land of Castlevania, but is typically thwarted by Simon Belmont and the N Team. He has a strained relationship with his teenage son Alucard. Dracula appears as a boss in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. He also appears in the game&#x27;s Adventure Mode: World of Light as the boss at the end of a &quot;Castlevania&quot;-themed map. Dracula, alongside Trevor Belmont, were added to &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; in August 2024 with the release of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; expansion.

Dracula appears as a central character in the 2017 animated series &quot;Castlevania&quot;, voiced by Graham McTavish. The series adapts the events of &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; and reveals how Dracula first comes to meet his human wife, Lisa, and later how her unjust execution drives him to wage extinction on mankind. He is defeated at the end of season two by the combined efforts of Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, and his son Alucard. Following his death, a number of individuals work to bring about Dracula&#x27;s resurrection, including Death, who very nearly succeeds in resurrecting Dracula along with Lisa in the body of a Rebis. Though Trevor Belmont destroys both the Rebis and Death, through unexplained means, Dracula and Lisa return to life. The two set out to build a new life for themselves, contemplating moving to Whitby and resolving to not tell Alucard that they are alive for the time being, feeling that he needs closure.

==Reception==
Dracula has become one of gaming&#x27;s most popular villains based on his role on the franchise. He was listed as the third top villain of 2006 by &quot;Game Informer&quot;. He was also listed as the number 7 most recurring video game character who has died repeatedly and been resurrected. He is ranked third on &quot;EGM&quot;&#x27;s Top Ten Badass Undead. GameDaily ranked him number sixteen in their &quot;Top 25 Evil Masterminds of All Time&quot; article, noting his persistence. His persistence resulted in him being ranked amongst the most persistent video game villains of all time by GameDaily. IGN listed him eight in their &quot;Top 10 Most Memorable Villains&quot; article, noting his grudge against the Belmonts and calling him &quot;the Timex of villains&quot;. In a later article, they listed him as one of their favorite monsters in video gaming, stating a preference for the &quot;Castlevania&quot; representation of Dracula over others due to him having &quot;a sense of fashion and style that few other versions possess.&quot; They would also list him as the 23rd best video game villain, calling him one of the most prolific video game villains ever. GamesRadar listed him first on their list of video game villains who never stay dead, stating that he has died more than any other video game villain ever and that like &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; antagonist Ganon, he never learns from his previous battles. According to Nintendo Power, the worst cover for a Nintendo Power was one depicting Simon Belmont holding the severed head of Dracula. It is considered the worst cover because hundreds of parents called in to complain about the goriness of the cover. It was reported in the complaints that children suffered nightmares resulting from the image. The banter between Dracula and Richter Belmont in &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; has often been mocked by fans for the deliveries of the lines and mistranslations.

GamesRadar listed Gabriel seventh in their &quot;Top 7... fallen heroes that became awesome villains&quot;, mentioning how his personality changed in the franchise when becoming a vampire, but still found his backstory ridiculously tragic. In retrospect, &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted Gabriel&#x27;s story did not feel like a &quot;Castlevania&quot; game despite visual similarities in terms of weapons and areas he explored. The lack of Dracula in the first &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; bothered gamers until the post-credit scene where Gabriel is revealed to be Dracula himself. While the Gabriel from &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot; has become a menace to mankind, &quot;GameSpot&quot; saw his previews from &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; as potential for redemption.However, GameSpot criticized Dracula&#x27;s and Alucard&#x27;s final showdown in &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; as the both father and son fail to conquer their inner demons. Rather than accomplish his own desire of ending his life, Dracula instead destroys the Mirror of Fate, leaving the story on a cliffhanger. Comic Book Resources praised the handling of and Dracula and Alucard&#x27;s characterizations in the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; series for how he handles his relationship with his son even if the ending might come across as too tragic as both father and son appeared to hate their own nature and wanted to end the Belmont bloodline with their own lives. &quot;The Escapist&quot; criticized Dracula&#x27;s characterization for coming to close to Kratos from &quot;God of War&quot; due to his angry personality and how weak he is portrayed sometimes in contrast to his previous incarnations as he now lacked the powers of having an army of his own. The fact that Dracula is portrayed in a heroic light also bothered the writer for making the writer comes up with worse characters to have Dracula be the hero, most notably Satan. GameSpot further commented on Gabriel&#x27;s characterization, claiming that while he possesses humanity in his debut, his transformation into Dracula and new actions will wonder gamers even if he is fighting for the sake of ending his own immortality.

For the animated &quot;Castlevania&quot; series, Anime News Network writer Zac Bertschy noted that one of its charms was that in contrast to many vampire series, Dracula was not the original real villain but instead the Church that killed his wife which causes Dracula to become evil. Bertschy also highly praised Scottish voice actor Graham McTavish for providing Dracula&#x27;s voice as he &quot;makes Dracula sound at once worldly and feral, aristocratic and satanic&quot;. The animated version of Alucard&#x27;s characterization in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot; series earned mixed responses, as he and his allies were overshadowed by Dracula&#x27;s underlings, who were seen as more fleshed out cast members than Alucard. The Verge agreed in regards to Dracula&#x27;s characterization, finding him as a &quot;sympathetic character as opposed to cartoonish villain with no real motivation beyond an unjustified drive to be evil&quot;. Dave Trumbore of Collider found Dracula&#x27;s thirst of revenge understandable despite the chaos he makes. Dan Seitz at Uproxx agreed but felt the series sidelined the character. In an analysis from the franchise, E. Charlotte Stevens from Birmingham City University claimed that noticed the character often shows signs of humanity when being surrounded by his family. IGN felt that the relationship between Alucard and his father was one of the best aspects of the second season due to the performance of their voice actors when they confront each other but suffer a mental breakdown upon acknowledging who are they facing.

In an interview regarding Dracula&#x27;s humanization, Anime News Network told the Netflix staff, Dracula&#x27;s humanization in the Netflix was better than the ones from other anti-villains like Magneto or Thanos which Executive Producer Adi Shankar found as an accomplishment.

==Trivia==
===Effects of the WGA strike===
Between January and June 1960, the 1960 Writers Guild of America strike took place, affecting the fall schedule. The networks had numerous holes, which were mostly filled with unscripted material, some of which included political programs in anticipation of the forthcoming 1960 United States presidential election. CBS gave the unprecedented step of showing episodes from previous seasons of popular series. Some timeslots however (particularly that of 10:30-11) were ceded to stations.

===&quot;Vast wasteland&quot; speech===
On May 9, 1961, at the annual convention of the National Association of Broadcasters new Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow delivered &quot;Television and the Public Interest,&quot; a scathing speech directed at the &quot;procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western badmen, Western goodmen, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons, and, endlessly, commercials, many screaming, cajoling, and offending, and, most of all, boredom [...] Is there one network president in this room who claims he can&#x27;t do better?&quot; Minow called TV a &quot;vast wasteland&quot;; the phrase was picked up by the press and resulted in bad publicity for the networks and for the television industry as a whole. According to television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), the networks were in a bind, though: they had already purchased their fall 1961 programs and had locked in their 1961–62 schedules. &quot;The best the networks could do was slot a few more public affairs shows, paint rosy pictures for 1962–63, and prepare to endure the barrage of criticism they felt certain would greet the new season.&quot;

<doc id="790206" wikidata="Q165419" url="?curid=790206" title="Ivan Mazepa">
<text>Ivan Stepanovych Mazepa (; ; ) was the Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host and the Left-bank Ukraine in 1687–1708. The historical events of Mazepa&#x27;s life have inspired many literary, artistic and musical works. He was famous as a patron of the arts.

Mazepa played an important role in the Battle of Poltava (1709), where after learning that Tsar Peter I intended to relieve him as acting hetman of Zaporozhian Host and to replace him with Alexander Menshikov, he defected from his army and sided with King Charles XII of Sweden. The political consequences and interpretation of this defection have resonated in the national histories both of Russia and of Ukraine.

The Russian Orthodox Church laid an anathema (excommunication) on Mazepa&#x27;s name in 1708 and still refuses to revoke it. The anathema was not recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which considers it uncanonical and imposed with political motives as a means of political and ideological repression, with no religious, theological or canonical reasons.

Pro-independence and anti-Russian elements in Ukraine from the 18th century onwards were derogatorily referred to as &quot;Mazepintsy&quot; (). The alienation of Mazepa from Ukrainian historiography continued during the Soviet period, but post-1991 in independent Ukraine Mazepa&#x27;s image has been gradually rehabilitated.

The Ukrainian corvette &quot;Hetman Ivan Mazepa&quot; of the Ukrainian Navy is named after him.

==Early life==
=== Family home ===
Mazepa was probably born on 30 March 1639, in Mazepyntsi, near Bila Tserkva, then part of the Kiev Voivodeship in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (today – Drozdy rural council, Bila Tserkva Raion), into a noble Ruthenian-Lithuanian family. His mother was Maryna Mokievska (1624–1707) (known from 1674 to 1675 by her monastic name Maria Magdalena), and his father was Stefan Adam Mazepa (?-1666). Maryna Mokievska came from the family of a Cossack officer who fought alongside Bohdan Khmelnytsky. She gave birth to two children – Ivan and Oleksandra. Stefan Mazepa served as a Cossack Ataman of Bila Tserkva (1654).

=== In Polish service ===
In 1657, Stefan Mazepa became involved with Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky, who pursued a pro-Polish policy. In 1659 Stefan Mazepa traveled to Warsaw to attend the Sejm and placed his son Ivan in service at the royal court of John II Casimir Vasa. Before that Ivan Mazepa probably studied at the Kiev Academy from the age of 10 and graduated with a degree in rhetoric. According to Samiilo Velychko, Ivan was to complete his philosophy course at the Jesuit college in Warsaw.

According to late tradition, King John Casimir sent Ivan Mazepa to study &quot;gunnery&quot; in Deventer (Dutch Republic) in 1656–1659, during which time he traveled across Western Europe. From 1659 the Polish king was sending him on numerous diplomatic missions to Ukraine. His service at the Polish royal court earned him a reputation as an alleged catholicized &quot;Lyakh&quot; – later the Russian Imperial government would effectively use this slur to discredit Mazepa.

During one of his missions, Mazepa met Jan Chryzostom Pasek, whom he took to be a supporter of the anti-royal confederation. He led to Pasek&#x27;s arrest and had him brought before the king, who was staying in Grodno at the time. According to Pasek&#x27;s account, he managed to prove his innocence, the king rewarded him for the harm he suffered and Mazepa lost the royal trust. Further on in his memoirs, Pasek recounts the story of under what circumstances Mazepa left Poland in 1663. According to Pasek Mazepa had an affair with Mrs. Falbowska, wife of his neighbour in Volhynia. When the man discovered an affair, he tied Mazepa naked to a horse, head to tail, and fastened the horse. The horse carried Mazepa to his household, but he was so badly wounded that his own subjects were unable to recognize him. Pasek&#x27;s memoirs were written in 1690-1695, when Mazepa was already a Cossack hetman; it is possible that Pasek, who had a personal grudge against Mazepa, colored the story. However, this anecdote also appears in the anonymous &quot;Memoirs to the Reign of Augustus II&quot; and in the memoirs of Marquis de Bonnac. The story was later recounted by Voltaire in his &quot;Histoire de Charles XII&quot; and became a recurring motif in the literary works of such writers as Victor Hugo, Lord Byron, Alexander Pushkin or Juliusz Słowacki, as well as in the paintings of such painters as Horace Vernet, Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Chassériau, Théodore Géricault and others.&quot;&quot; The tale was probably widespread by then and referred to Mazepa&#x27;s reputation as a womanizer.

Despite Pasek&#x27;s accounts, Mazepa still remained in royal service. In February 1663 he was sent to the Cossack Hetman Pavel Tetera, to whom he brought the Hetman&#x27;s mace, presented to Tetera by . Mazepa then took part in a royal campaign against Russia in left-bank Ukraine in years 1663-1664. Mazepa was certainly still at the royal court in 1665, probably until the abdication of John II Casimir in 1668.

=== Under Hetman Doroshenko ===
After the death of his father (ca. 1665), he inherited the title of the Chernihiv cupbearer. From 1669 to 1673 Mazepa served under Petro Doroshenko (Hetman of Right-Bank Ukraine from 1665 to 1672) as a squadron commander in the Hetman Guard, particularly during Doroshenko&#x27;s 1672 campaign in Halychyna, and as a chancellor on diplomatic missions to Poland, Crimea, and the Ottoman Empire. From 1674 to 1681 Mazepa served as a &quot;courtier&quot; of Doroshenko&#x27;s rival Hetman Ivan Samoylovych after Mazepa was captured on the way to Crimea by the Kosh Otaman Ivan Sirko in 1674. From 1677 to 1678 Mazepa participated in the Chyhyryn campaigns during which Yuri Khmelnytsky, with the support from the Ottoman Empire, tried to regain power in Ukraine. The young, educated Mazepa quickly rose through the Cossack ranks, and from 1682 to 1686 he served as an Aide-de-Camp General (Heneralny Osaul).

==Hetman==
===Rule===
In 1687 Ivan Mazepa accused Samoylovych of conspiring to secede from Russia, secured his ouster, and was elected the Hetman of Left-bank Ukraine in Kolomak, with the support of Vasily Galitzine. At the same time Ivan Mazepa signed the Kolomak Articles, which were based on the Hlukhiv Articles of Demian Mnohohrishny. In 1689 Mazepa supported the deposition of Tsarevna Sophia, who had served as de-facto regent of Tsar Peter I, which helped him ingratiate himself with the monarch, who valued the wide experience and education of the much older hetman. In words of a Russian historian, Mazepa &quot;was like a father to Peter I in a sense&quot;.

As hetman, Mazepa used his knowledge in military matters to introduce a new successful strategy in the fight against the Tatars and their Ottoman overlords. This success relieved both Ukraine and Muscovy from the danger of devastating enemy raids and led Peter I to award the hetman with the Order of St. Andrew, the Tsardom&#x27;s highest honour. The order, as well as the title of honourable prince of the Holy Roman Empire, awarded to the hetman by Emperor Joseph I in 1707 as recognition of his help in the fight against the Ottomans and Tatars, greatly contributed to Mazepa&#x27;s status both in Ukraine and at the Moscow court.

With the personal agreement of Peter I, Mazepa managed to become an undisputed ruler of the Hetmanate, concentrating most power over Ukraine, including gathering of taxes, in hands of his own administration. As hetman, Mazepa became known as a patron of culture and arts. A multitude of churches were built all over Ukraine during his reign in the Ukrainian Baroque style. He founded schools and printing houses, and expanded the Kiev-Mohyla Academy, the primary educational institution of Ukraine at the time. In many regards Mazepa greatly contributed to the establishment of the Russian Empire by supporting the policies of Peter I and providing the monarch with people needed to bring his reformist ideas into life. For example, the majority of religious figures who helped Peter I to reform the Russian Orthodox Church by bringing it under increased state control came from the Hetmanate, including Orthodox bishops Stefan Yavorsky and Theophan Prokopovich.

Himself a highly educated person who could speak both Latin and German, Mazepa established his court in a Western manner, reflecting the influence of Baroque art and literature on Ukrainian lands during that period. Mazepa&#x27;s personal residence was reported to house one of the most extensive libraries of its time, containing numerous books and illuminated manuscripts from around Europe.

===The Great Northern War===
In 1700, as the Russian Empire entered the Great Northern War against the Swedish Empire, Mazepa, despite having concerns about the Tsar&#x27;s adventurous foreign policies, supported Peter I with troops and resources. In 1702, the Cossacks of Right-bank Ukraine, under the leadership of colonel Semen Paliy, began an uprising against Poland, which after early successes was defeated. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar Peter I to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of Right-bank Ukraine, while Poland was weakened by an invasion of Swedish king Charles XII. In 1704 Peter I allowed the hetman to incorporate the Right-bank territories into the Hetmanate, uniting Ukraine on both sides of the Dnieper for the first time in decades.

At the same time, Peter I decided to reform the Russian army and to centralize control over his realm. In Mazepa&#x27;s opinion, the strengthening of Russia&#x27;s central power could put at risk the broad autonomy granted to the Cossack Hetmanate under the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654. Attempts to assert control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks included demands of having them fight in any of the tsar&#x27;s wars, instead of only defending their own land against regional enemies as was agreed to in previous treaties. Now Cossack forces were made to fight in distant wars in Livonia and Lithuania, leaving their own homes unprotected from the Tatars and Poles. Ill-equipped and not properly trained to fight on par with the tactics of modern European armies, Cossacks suffered heavy losses and low morale. The Hetman himself started to feel his post threatened in the face of increasing calls to replace him with one of the abundant generals of the Russian army.

===Change of sides===
In 1707, after vanquishing the united forces of Peter&#x27;s allies - Denmark, Saxony and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII started a campaign against Moscow. Suffering from shortages of gunpowder and provision, the Swedes detoured to Ukraine in order to replenish their stocks. The tsar ignored Mazepa&#x27;s appeals to defend the Hetmanate and ordered the hetman to burn the territory in the Swedes&#x27; path. Unwilling to sacrifice his realm and displeased by Peter&#x27;s treatment of himself as a simple subordinate, throughout 1708 Mazepa started secret talks with the Swedish side.

The last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński, an ally of Charles XII of Sweden, who threatened to attack the Cossack Hetmanate in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the Treaty of Pereyaslav, since Russia refused to protect Ukraine&#x27;s territory and left it to fare on its own. As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar.

According to William Pokhlyobkin, it was from that moment that King Charles XII of Sweden granted Mazepa the right to use the colors of the Swedish military bandera (yellow and blue) as the insignia of the Cossack detachments led by Mazepa, later these would be the colors of the Flag of Ukraine.
Mazepa&#x27;s call to arms was further weakened by the Orthodox Clergy&#x27;s allegiance to the Tsar. Learning of Mazepa&#x27;s treason, the Russian army sacked and razed the Cossack Hetmanate&#x27;s capital of Baturyn, killing most of the defending garrison and many common people. Peter also had the hetman expelled from the Orthodox Church by declaring an anathema on his name.

Under the influence of the Sack of Baturyn, those Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new hetman, Ivan Skoropadsky, on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa&#x27;s newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine&#x27;s population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the Zaporozhian Sich, which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. Inhumane massacres by Russia followed the Sich Cossacks support of Mazepa, as Peter the Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack. The Russian army was ordered to tie the dead Cossacks to crosses and float them down the Dnieper River to the Black Sea.

===Decisive battle===
The Swedish and Russian armies spent the first half of 1709 maneuvering for advantage in the anticipated great battle, and trying to secure the support of the local populace. Finally in June the Battle of Poltava took place. It was won by Russia and Peter the Great, putting an end to Mazepa&#x27;s hopes of transferring Ukraine into the control of Sweden, which in a treaty had promised independence to Ukraine. The hetman fled with Charles XII to the fortress of Bender (Tighina), in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s vassal Moldavia, where Mazepa soon died at the age of 70.

Mazepa was buried in Galați (now Romania), but his tomb was disturbed several times and eventually lost as a result of the Sfântul Gheorghe (St. George) Church demolition in 1962.

==Title and style==
As Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host, Mazepa&#x27;s style was as follows:
Hetman Ivan Mazepa of the Tsar&#x27;s Illustrious Highness&#x27;s Zaporozhian Host, Knight of the Glorious Order of the Holy Apostle Andrew ().

==Historical legacy==

Mazepa&#x27;s decision to abandon his allegiance to the Russian Empire was considered treason by the Russian Tsar and a violation of the Treaty of Pereyaslav. However, others argue that it was Imperial Russia who broke the treaty by not even trying to protect the Cossack homeland during busy fighting abroad while Ukrainian peasants were complaining about the conduct of local Muscovite troops. Many Cossacks had died while building Saint Petersburg, and the Tsar planned to deploy Cossack troops far from their homeland. According to Russian historian Tatiana Tairova-Yakovlava, Mazepa had little chance of remaining in power if he hadn&#x27;t risen up against Peter I, as the tsar&#x27;s imperial ambitions envisioned the destruction of Ukrainian Cossack autonomy. In the aftermath of the Battle of Poltava the Hetmanate was deprived of much of its independence, although it formally remained an autonomous entity. Its final demise took place in 1764, under the rule of Catherine the Great, who transformed the territory formerly ruled by hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks into the Little Russia Governorate.

The image of a disgraceful traitor persisted throughout Russian and Soviet history. The Russian Orthodox Church anathemaised and excommunicated Mazepa for political reasons. Until 1869, his name was even added to the list of traitors publicly cursed in Russian churches during the Feast of Orthodoxy service, along with Pugachev, Razin and False Dmitry I. Later, a positive view of Mazepa was taboo in the Soviet Union and considered as a sign of &quot;Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism&quot;. During the years of Perestroika, however, many historical works saw light that viewed Mazepa differently. After Ukraine&#x27;s independence in 1991, Mazepa was proclaimed a national hero in Ukraine&#x27;s official historiography and mainstream media, as he was the first post-Pereyaslav Treaty hetman to take a stand against the Tsar, who failed to abide by the Treaty. This view however was disputed by pro-Russian factions. Russia has repeatedly condemned Ukraine for honoring the figure of Ivan Mazepa. In an April 2009 survey by the Research &amp; Branding Group, 30 percent of the population of Ukraine viewed Mazepa as &quot;a man who fought for the independence of Ukraine&quot;, while 28 percent viewed him &quot;as a turncoat who joined the enemy&#x27;s ranks&quot;.

During an event in Mazepyntsi to mark the 370th birthday (20 March 2009) of Hetman Mazepa, President Viktor Yushchenko called for the myth about the alleged treason of Mazepa to be dispelled. According to Yushchenko, the hetman wanted to create an independent Ukraine, and architecture thrived in Ukraine over the years of Mazepa&#x27;s rule: &quot;Ukraine was reviving as the country of European cultural traditions&quot;. The same day, around 100 people held a protest in Simferopol against the marking of the 370th birthday of Mazepa. In May 2009 the Russian foreign ministry stated in an answer to Ukraine&#x27;s preparations to mark the 300th anniversary of the battle of Poltava and plans to erect a monument to Mazepa that those were attempts at an &quot;artificial, far-fetched confrontation with Russia&quot;.

Mazepa&#x27;s portrait is found on the ₴10 (Ukrainian currency) bill.

In August 2009, a monument to the hetman, the work of the sculptor Giennadij Jerszow, was unveiled at Dytynets Park in Chernihiv. The opening was accompanied by clashes between the police and opponents of Mazepa.

After researching his genealogy in 2009, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko did not rule out that his family is connected with the family of Mazepa.

In August 2009, Yushchenko decreed the resuming of a halted construction of an Ivan Mazepa monument in Poltava. A monument to Mazepa was to be erected on Slava Square in Kyiv in 2010 to fulfill a decree of Yushchenko. In May 2010 Kyiv city civil servants stated the city was ready to establish a monument as soon as the Cabinet of Ukraine would fund this project. According to them the situation was similar to other unrealised monuments such as the &quot;Unification Monument&quot; and a monument to Pylyp Orlyk who in 2010 were conceived in 2002 and 2003 but still not built in 2010. The Poltava City Council on 25 February 2016 voted in favor of the monument. On 6 May 2016 President Petro Poroshenko unveiled the Mazepa monument in Poltava.

The Ivan Mazepa Street in Kyiv, which runs past the Pechersk Lavra, was partly changed to Lavrska Street in July 2010. The move was met with protests.

In Galați (Romania), Mazepa is remembered in the name of two central neighbourhoods (Mazepa I and II) and with a statue in a park on Basarabiei street.

In 2020 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave the 54th Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Army the honorary title of &quot;Ivan Mazepa&quot;. In 2022 Zelenskyy named a Ukrainian Navy Ada-class corvette after Mazepa.

<text>Quentin Kūhiō Kawānanakoa (born September 28, 1961) is an American politician and member of the House of Kawānanakoa. Kawānanakoa is an organizer of the Republican Party of Hawaii. He is also an heir to the James Campbell estate.

==Early years==
Kawānanakoa was born September 28, 1961. He was the second son of his father Edward A. Kawānanakoa and his mother Carolyn Willison Kawānanakoa. He was raised in Honolulu where he graduated from Punahou School. Kawānanakoa went on to study at the University of Southern California. He returned to Oahu and graduated from the William S. Richardson School of Law. Upon obtaining his Juris Doctor degree, he served in private practice at the law firm Case, Bigelow &amp; Lombardi until 2000. He was a member of the inaugural 1997 class of the Pacific Century Fellows.

==Political life==
In 1994, Kawānanakoa followed in his ancestors&#x27; footsteps and got involved in politics. Like his great-grandmother Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa and great uncle Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole, Kawānanakoa joined the Republican Party of Hawaii for its pro-business stance. He ran and won an election for the Hawai`i State House of Representatives, an office he served through 1998. He rose through the ranks of party leadership becoming minority floor leader. During an attempt to mount a challenge for the Congressional seat held by Neil Abercrombie, Kawānanakoa abruptly retired from active political life after being hospitalized.

In April 2006, after eight years out of the public eye, Kawānanakoa announced his run for the Congressional seat held by Ed Case, who chose not to run for U.S. Senate. He declared his candidacy on April 23, 2006. In the primary elections held on September 24, 2006, Kawānanakoa was narrowly defeated by State Senator Robert Hogue. The final vote total was Hogue: 8,393 votes (45.6%) vs. Kawānanakoa: 8,194 votes (44.5%). Senator Hogue went on to lose to Mazie Hirono.

In 2008, Kawānanakoa unsuccessfully ran for the Hawaii State House of Representatives. His opponent in the November 4, 2008, election was Democrat Chris Kalani Lee. Lee won with 5,885 votes to Kawānanakoa&#x27;s 3,374 votes.

==Family==
In September 1995, Kawānanakoa married Elizabeth Broun, a native of Jamaica. Their first child, Kincaid Kawānanakoa, was born in June 1997. In December 1999, their second child, Riley, was born. Quentin is the great-grandson of Prince David Kawānanakoa and Princess Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa through his paternal grandmother Abigail Kapiolani Kawānanakoa.

==Buildings==
Religious, particularly LDS buildings, are prominent in Salt Lake City.

Settled by Brigham Young and 147 other pioneers on July 24, 1847, these Latter-day Saints were fleeing persecution after the death of Joseph Smith. Young originally intended the city and territory to be a religious theocracy. Although the government has long been secular, and even though less than 50% of residents in Salt Lake City are LDS, the city has a large number of religious buildings. It is the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Unless noted, all of these buildings are in or around Downtown Salt Lake City.

<text>A retail cashier or simply a cashier is a person who handles the cash register at various locations such as the point of sale in a retail store. The most common use of the title is in the retail industry, but this job title is also used in the context of accountancy for the person responsible for receiving and disbursing money or within branch banking in the United Kingdom for the job known in the United States as a bank teller.

==Retail==

In a shop, a cashier (or checkout operator) is an employee who scans the goods through a cash register, that the customer wishes to purchase. In most modern stores, the items are scanned by a barcode positioned on the item with the use of a laser scanner. After all of the items have been scanned, the cashier then collects the payment (in cash, check, and/or by credit/debit card) for the goods or services exchanged, records the amount received, makes change, and issues receipts or tickets to customers. Cashiers will record amounts received and may prepare reports of transactions, reads and record totals shown on cash register tape and verify against cash on hand. A cashier may be required to know value and features of items for which money is received; may cash checks; may give cash refunds or issue credit memorandums to customers for returned merchandise; and may operate ticket-dispensing machines and the like.

In one form or another, cashiers have been around for thousands of years. In many businesses, such as grocery stores, the cashier is considered a &quot;stepping stone&quot; position. Many employers require employees to be cashiers in order to move up to customer service or other positions.

Cashiers are at risk of repetitive strain injuries due to the repeated movements often necessary to do the job, such as entering information on a keypad, moving product over a scanner, and standing on one&#x27;s feet for several hours.

===Demographics===
In the United States, the majority of cashiers are women. According to &quot;Fox Business&quot;, as of 2016, an estimated 70% of cashiers are female.

===Job outlook===
In the United States, the employed number of cashiers is expected to decline. From 2023 to 2033, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects an 11% job outlook decline.

===Salary===
In 2022, the median salary in the United States for a cashier was $28,240.

==Alternative types of cashiers==
===Accountancy=== 

A less-current meaning of the term referred responsible for receiving and disbursing money in a business. In a non-retail business, this would be a position of significant responsibility. With an ever-larger proportion of transactions being done using cash substitutes (such as checks, credit cards, and debit cards), the amount of cash handled by such employees has declined, and this usage of the word &quot;cashier&quot; has been largely supplanted by the title comptroller.

===Retail banking===
In a bank branch in the United Kingdom, a cashier is someone who enables customers to interact with their accounts, such as by accepting and disbursing money and accepting checks. In the United States, the job title is bank teller.

<doc id="790284" wikidata="Q108737" url="?curid=790284" title="Nitrous oxide engine">
<text>A nitrous oxide engine, or nitrous oxide system (NOS) is an internal combustion engine in which oxygen for burning the fuel comes from the decomposition of nitrous oxide, N2O, as well as air. The system increases the engine&#x27;s power output by allowing fuel to be burned at a higher-than-normal rate, because of the higher partial pressure of oxygen injected with the fuel mixture. Nitrous injection systems may be &quot;dry&quot;, where the nitrous oxide is injected separately from fuel, or &quot;wet&quot; in which additional fuel is carried into the engine along with the nitrous. NOS may not be permitted for street or highway use, depending on local regulations. N2O use is permitted in certain classes of auto racing. Reliable operation of an engine with nitrous injection requires careful attention to the strength of engine components and to the accuracy of the mixing systems, otherwise destructive detonations or exceeding engineered component maximums may occur. Nitrous oxide systems were applied as early as World War II for certain aircraft engines.

==Terminology==
In the context of racing, nitrous oxide is often termed nitrous or NOS. The term NOS is derived from the initials of the company name Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc. (now a brand of Holley Performance Products) one of the pioneering companies in the development of nitrous oxide injection systems for automotive performance use, and has become a genericized trademark. Nitro is also sometimes used, though incorrect, as it refers more to nitromethane engines.

==Mechanism==
When a mole of nitrous oxide decomposes, it releases half a mole of O2 molecules (oxygen gas), and one mole of N2 molecules (nitrogen gas). This decomposition allows an oxygen concentration of 36.36% to be reached. Nitrogen gas is non-combustible and does not support combustion. Air—which contains only 21% oxygen, the rest being nitrogen and other equally non-combustible and non-combustion-supporting gasses—permits a 12-percent-lower maximum-oxygen level than that of nitrous oxide. This oxygen supports combustion; it combines with fuels such as gasoline, alcohol, diesel fuel, propane, or compressed natural gas (CNG) to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, along with heat, which causes the former two products of combustion to expand and exert pressure on pistons, driving the engine.

Nitrous oxide is stored as a liquid in tanks, but is a gas under atmospheric conditions. When injected as a liquid into an inlet manifold, the vaporization and expansion causes a reduction in air/fuel charge temperature with an associated increase in density, thereby increasing the cylinder&#x27;s volumetric efficiency.

As the decomposition of N2O into oxygen and nitrogen gas is exothermic and thus contributes to a higher temperature in the combustion engine, the decomposition increases engine efficiency and performance, which is directly related to the difference in temperature between the unburned fuel mixture and the hot combustion gasses produced in the cylinders. 

All systems are based on a single stage kit, but these kits can be used in multiples (called two-, three-, or even four-stage kits). The most advanced systems are controlled by an electronic progressive delivery unit that allows a single kit to perform better than multiple kits can. Most Pro Mod and some Pro Street drag race cars use three stages for additional power, but more and more are switching to pulsed progressive technology. Progressive systems have the advantage of utilizing a larger amount of nitrous (and fuel) to produce even greater power increases as the additional power and torque are gradually introduced (as opposed to being applied to the engine and transmission immediately), reducing the risk of mechanical shock and, consequently, damage.

==Identification==
Cars with nitrous-equipped engines may be identified by the &quot;purge&quot; of the delivery system that most drivers perform prior to reaching the starting line. A separate electrically operated valve is used to release air and gaseous nitrous oxide trapped in the delivery system. This brings liquid nitrous oxide all the way up through the plumbing from the storage tank to the solenoid valve or valves that will release it into the engine&#x27;s intake tract. When the purge system is activated, one or more plumes of nitrous oxide will be visible for a moment as the liquid flashes to vapor as it is released. The purpose of a nitrous purge is to ensure that the correct amount of nitrous oxide is delivered the moment the system is activated as nitrous and fuel jets are sized to produce correct air / fuel ratios, and as liquid nitrous is denser than gaseous nitrous, any nitrous vapor in the lines will cause the car to &quot;bog&quot; for an instant (as the ratio of nitrous / fuel will be too rich reducing engine power) until liquid nitrous oxide reaches the injection nozzle.

==Types of nitrous systems==
There are two categories of nitrous systems: &quot;dry&quot; &amp; &quot;wet&quot; with four main delivery methods of nitrous systems: &quot;single nozzle&quot;, &quot;direct port&quot;, &quot;plate&quot;, and &quot;bar&quot; used to discharge nitrous into the plenums of the intake manifold. Nearly all nitrous systems use specific orifice inserts, called jets, along with pressure calculations to meter the nitrous, or nitrous and fuel in wet applications, delivered to create a proper air-fuel ratio (AFR) for the additional horsepower desired.

===Dry===
In a &quot;dry&quot; nitrous system the nitrous delivery method provides nitrous only. The extra fuel required is introduced through the fuel injectors, keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property is what gives the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure or by increasing the time the fuel injectors remain open. 

Dry nitrous systems typically rely on a single nozzle delivery method, but all of the four main delivery methods can be used in dry applications. Dry systems are not typically used in carbureted applications due to the nature of a carburetor&#x27;s function and inability to provide large amounts of on-demand fuel. Dry nitrous systems on fuel injected engines will use increased fuel pressure or injector pulsewidth upon system activation as a means of providing the correct ratio of fuel for the nitrous. 

===Wet===
In a &quot;wet&quot; nitrous system the nitrous delivery method provides nitrous and fuel together resulting in the intake manifold being &quot;wet&quot; with fuel, giving the category its name. Wet nitrous systems can be used in all four main delivery methods.

In wet systems on fuel/direct injected engines care must be taken to avoid backfires caused by fuel pooling in the intake tract or manifold and/or uneven distribution of the nitrous/fuel mixture. Port and direct fuel injection engines have intake systems engineered for the delivery of air only, not air and fuel. Since most fuels are heavier than air and not in a gaseous state when used with nitrous systems it does not behave in the same way as air alone; thus the possibility of the fuel being unevenly distributed to the combustion chambers of the engine causing lean conditions/detonation and/or pooling in parts of the intake tract/manifold presenting a dangerous situation in which the fuel may be ignited uncontrollably causing catastrophic failure to components. Carbureted and single point/throttle body injected engines use a wet manifold design that is engineered to evenly distribute fuel and air mixtures to all combustion chambers, making this mostly a non-issue for these applications.

===Single nozzle===
A &quot;single nozzle&quot; nitrous system introduces the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture via a single injection point. The nozzle is typically placed in the intake pipe/tract after the air filter, prior to the intake manifold and/or throttle body in fuel injected applications, and after the throttle body in carbureted applications. In wet systems the high pressures of the nitrous injected causes the aerosolization of the fuel injected in tandem via the nozzle, allowing for more thorough and even distribution of the nitrous/fuel mixture.

===Direct port===
A &quot;direct port&quot; nitrous system introduces the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture as close to the intake ports of the engine as is feasible via individual nozzles directly in each intake runner. Direct port nitrous systems will use the same or similar nozzles as those in single nozzle systems, just in numbers equal to or in multiples of the number of intake ports of the engine. Being that direct port systems do not have to rely on intake tract/manifold design to evenly distribute the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture, they are inherently more precise than other delivery methods. The greater number of nozzles also allows a greater total amount of nitrous to be delivered than other systems. Multiple &quot;stages&quot; of nitrous can be accomplished by using multiple sets of nozzles at each intake port to further increase the power potential. Direct port nitrous systems are the most common delivery method in racing applications.

===Plate===
A &quot;plate&quot; nitrous system uses a spacer placed somewhere between the throttle body and intake ports with holes drilled along its interior surfaces, or in a tube that is suspended from the plate, for the nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture to be distributed through. Plate systems provide a drill-less solution compared to other delivery methods as the plates are generally application specific and fit between existing components such as the throttle body-to-intake-manifold or upper-intake-manifold-to-lower-intake-manifold junctions. Requiring little more than longer fasteners, plate systems are the most easily reversed systems as they need little to no permanent changes to the intake tract. Dependent on application, plate systems can provide precise nitrous or fuel/nitrous mixture distribution similar to that of direct port systems.

===Bar===
A &quot;bar&quot; nitrous system utilizes a hollow tube, with a number of holes drilled along its length, placed inside the intake plenum to deliver nitrous. Bar nitrous delivery methods are almost exclusively dry nitrous systems due to the non-optimal fuel distribution possibilities of the bar. Bar nitrous systems are popular with racers that prefer their nitrous use to be hidden, as the nitrous distribution method is not immediately apparent and most associated components of the nitrous system can be obscured from view.

===Propane or CNG===
Nitrous systems can be used with a gaseous fuel such as propane or compressed natural gas. This has the advantage of being technically a &quot;dry&quot; system as the fuel is not in a liquid state when introduced to the intake tract.

==Reliability concerns==
The use of nitrous oxide carries with it concerns about the reliability and longevity of an engine present with all power adders. Due to the greatly increased cylinder pressures, the engine as a whole is placed under greater stress, primarily those components associated with the engine&#x27;s rotating assembly. An engine with components unable to cope with the increased stress imposed by the use of nitrous systems can experience major engine damage, such as cracked or destroyed pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, and/or blocks. Proper strengthening of engine components in addition to accurate and adequate fuel delivery are key to nitrous system use without catastrophic failure.

In addition, nitrous oxide should not be used in vehicles with an automatic transmission, as the highly increased engine power and torque may cause stress damage to the torque converter and the transmission itself.

==Street legality==
Nitrous oxide injection systems for automobiles are illegal for road use in some countries. For example, in New South Wales, Australia, the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Modifications (in use since 1994) states in clause 3.1.5.7.3 that &quot;The use or fitment of nitrous oxide injection systems is not permitted.&quot;

In Great Britain, there are no restrictions on use of , but the modification must be declared to the insurance company, which is likely to result in a higher premium for Motor Vehicle insurance or refusal to insure.

In Germany, despite its strict TÜV rules, a nitrous system can be installed and used legally in a street driven car. The requirements for the technical standard of the system are similar to those of aftermarket natural gas conversions.

==Racing rules==
Several sanctioning bodies in drag racing allow or disallow the use of nitrous oxide in certain classes or have nitrous oxide specific classes. Nitrous is allowed in Formula Drift competition.

==History==
A similar basic technique was used during World War II by Luftwaffe aircraft with the GM-1 system to maintain the power output of aircraft engines when at high altitude where the air density is lower. Accordingly, it was only used by specialized planes like high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, high-speed bombers and high-altitude interceptors. It was sometimes used with the Luftwaffe&#x27;s form of methanol-water injection, designated MW 50 (both meant as &quot;Notleistung&quot; short-term power boosting measures), to produce substantial increases in performance for fighter aircraft over short periods of time, as with their combined use on the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H fighter prototypes. 

British World War II usage of nitrous oxide injector systems were modifications of Merlin engines carried out by the Heston Aircraft Company for use in certain night fighter variants of the de Havilland Mosquito and photo reconnaissance versions of the Supermarine Spitfire.

<text>Street Fighter Alpha 2, known as in Japan, Asia, South America, and Oceania, is a 1996 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. The game is a remake of the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#x27; Dreams&quot; and features a number of improvements, such as new attacks, stages, endings, and gameplay features. It was ported to the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Super Nintendo home consoles globally in 1996, and later a Windows port. It was followed by &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; in 1998.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; retains most of the new features introduced in the original &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, such as the three-level Super Combo gauge, Alpha Counters, Air-Blocking, and Fall Breaking. The main new feature in the game is the inclusion of the Custom Combo system (Original Combo in Japan), which replaces the Chain Combos from the first &quot;Alpha&quot;. If the Super Combo gauge is on Lv. 1 or above, the player can initiate a Custom Combo pressing two punch buttons and a kick or one punch button and two kicks. The player can then perform any series of basic and special moves to create a Custom Combo until the Timer Gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out. The characters Guy and Gen can still perform Chain Combos, but only to a limited extent. Additionally, each character now has two Alpha Counters instead of just one: one that can be performed with a kick button and another with a punch button.

The single-player mode, much like the original &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, consists of eight matches against computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player&#x27;s selected character. Each character also has a secret &quot;rival&quot; whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode. After meeting certain requirements, the rival will interrupt one of the player&#x27;s matches and exchange dialogue with the player&#x27;s character, and the player character will then fight the rival instead. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike &quot;Super Turbo&quot; and the original &quot;Alpha&quot;, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player&#x27;s final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.

===Characters===
The game brings back all thirteen characters from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, with M. Bison, Akuma, and Dan now being immediately selectable as playable characters. In addition to the &quot;Alpha&quot; roster, &quot;Alpha 2&quot; includes Dhalsim and Zangief, both from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Gen, an assassin from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, Rolento, a member of the Mad Gear gang who originally appeared in &quot;Final Fight&quot;, and newcomer Sakura, a Japanese schoolgirl who takes up street fighting after witnessing one of Ryu&#x27;s battles. The game also features a &quot;classic-style&quot; alternative version of Chun-Li where she is wearing her outfit from the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series.

==Development==
According to Capcom senior planner Shinji Mikami, &quot;When we were trying to get the balance of Alpha 2 right we only concentrated on Alpha 2. That&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s important. We don&#x27;t really have to get the actual same damage as Alpha. In Alpha 2 some new characters were introduced, so in order to maintain the game balance we had to increase the damage for the normal hits. In addition, this time for Alpha 2 we wanted to focus on the importance of the normal hits and not just the specials.&quot;

&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; was first unveiled at the February 1996 AOU show in Tokyo.

Both Manga Entertainment/A.P.P.P. and Group TAC developed OVA adaptations based on the game, titled &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot; (2000) and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Generations&quot; (2005), which were both co-produced by Kaoru Mfaume. All of the characters except Gen and Dan also have roles in the Canadian-American cartoon &quot;Street Fighter: The Animated Series&quot;.

==Versions==

===Arcade===
&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; was released under the title &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2&quot; in Japan, Asia, and South America. The North American and European versions of &quot;Alpha 2&quot; feature three additional characters who were not in the &quot;Zero 2&quot; version: Evil Ryu and alternative versions of Dhalsim and Zangief known as EX versions, where they use their movesets from the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series and do not have access to the Super Combo gauge. These three characters were selected by Capcom USA.

Capcom also released an updated version of &quot;Zero 2&quot; titled Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha in Japan, Asia, and South America, which features all the additional characters from &quot;Alpha 2&quot;, as well as other changes to the game. In addition to Zangief and Dhalsim, &quot;Zero 2 Alpha&quot; also features EX versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li (where she is wearing her outfit from the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series, similarly to the &quot;classic-style&quot; version of her), Sagat, and M. Bison, all of whom were characters from &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;. Custom Combos are now executed by pressing a punch and kick button of the same strength simultaneously and now require half ( level) of the Super Combo gauge filled to perform them. Some of the characters have gained new moves such as Ryu&#x27;s &quot;Shakunetsu Hadouken&quot; and Dhalsim&#x27;s Yoga Tempest. &quot;Zero 2 Alpha&quot; also features a survival mode, as well as a 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle mode similar to the hidden &quot;Ryu and Ken vs. Bison mode&quot; in the original &quot;Alpha&quot;. In this version, Evil Ryu has different dialogue exchanges and a different ending from his regular counterpart.

===Home versions===
* &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version features an arranged soundtrack (in the form of XA-Audio), while the Saturn version uses an arranged soundtrack in a streaming ADPCM format (which looped properly like in the arcade version). Both versions feature Shin Akuma as a selectable character via a secret code (which differs between the two versions; the PlayStation version requires players to move the cursor in a pattern which forms the letter Z on the character select screen; the Saturn version requires a pattern that forms an X), in addition to the &quot;classic-style&quot; Chun-Li. The Saturn version is the only one of the two versions to feature the characters Evil Ryu, EX Dhalsim, and EX Zangief from the North American and European arcade versions. The Saturn version also features an exclusive survival mode, as well as an art gallery. The PlayStation version of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; was re-released for the PSP and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network on June 4, 2009 in North America.
* The SNES version was also released in 1996. Since third-party publishers such as Capcom were increasingly concentrating on CD-based consoles, outside of Japan this version was published by Nintendo instead of Capcom. It makes use of the S-DD1 chip for on-the-fly graphic decompression. Despite the graphics decompression chip, this version has loading times when entering matches while sounds are loaded onto the sound chip. Unlike the PlayStation and Saturn versions, the only secret characters available to the player are the &quot;classic-style&quot; Chun-Li and Shin Akuma. The SNES port of the game sold poorly, and Capcom resorted to selling large shipments of cartridges at a loss outside the United States to remove unsold inventory from warehouses. This version was re-released for the Virtual Console in North America on December 7, 2009 and in the PAL region on January 29, 2010 for the Wii, and in North America on May 22, 2014, and in the PAL region on October 2, 2014 for the Wii U.
* A Windows PC version was also released; based on the PlayStation version (but using the arcade soundtrack in 22 kHz WAV format) in 1997. This version was sold as a bundle with the original &quot;Alpha&quot; in Japan. The Windows PC version was re-released on GOG.com in 2012.
* A home console version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha&quot; was released under the title Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold in North America, Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Prime) in Europe, and Street Fighter Zero 2 (Dash) in Japan, as part of the &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot;, a compilation released on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn that also includes &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;. &quot;Alpha 2 Gold&quot; features most of the same changes, features, and game modes as the arcade version of &quot;Zero 2 Alpha&quot;, only omitting the 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle mode from that version. In addition to all of the characters featured in previous versions of &quot;Alpha 2&quot; (including the console-exclusive Shin Akuma), &quot;Gold&quot; features a version of Cammy based on her rendition from &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, who appears as a hidden character selectable only in the game″s Versus and Training modes (the latter only in the Saturn Version, as it is absent from the PlayStation version). The game also features an &quot;Akuma Mode&quot;, where the player can fight against Shin Akuma immediately. This version was re-released in Japan as a standalone game in the PlayStation the Best and Satakore budget games lines.
* The 2006 PlayStation 2 compilation &quot;Street Fighter Alpha Anthology&quot; features a version of the original &quot;Alpha 2&quot; based on the arcade game, as well as a revised version of &quot;Alpha 2 Gold&quot; which features Cammy as a selectable character in the game″s arcade mode (with her own storyline and ending). Both games feature Dramatic Battle and Survival modes in addition to the Arcade, Versus, and Training modes. The Japanese version of the compilation (&quot;Street Fighter Zero: Fighters&#x27; Generation&quot;) features the arcade versions of &quot;Zero 2&quot; and &quot;Zero 2 Alpha&quot;, as well as the US version of &quot;Alpha 2&quot; and the revised version of &quot;Zero 2 (Dash)&quot; with the playable Cammy as hidden games.
* &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; released in May 2018. This version is arcade-perfect and does not carry over the coding used in earlier home console versions. Save states are available to allow the player to resume from where they left. The &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; does not include the &quot;Alpha 2 Gold&quot; update.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2&quot; on their May 1, 1996 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month, outperforming titles such as &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2&quot; went on to be the highest-grossing arcade game of 1996 in Japan. &quot;Game Machine&quot; also listed &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha&quot; on their October 1, 1996 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the month.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the arcade version 3 out of 5 stars, praising the large number of characters, smooth animation, innovative backgrounds, and &quot;wonderful&quot; character design. He deemed the custom combos &quot;an unprecedented, new, and complex innovation in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; gameplay&quot;, though he found some points of their implementation to be odd. He concluded, &quot;Although it&#x27;s just another 2D fighter for those who aren&#x27;t paying attention, this is a fine new addition for true hard-core gameplayers.&quot;

In the Japanese arcade magazine &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2&quot; was voted Best Game of 1996 in the Tenth Annual Grand Prize. &quot;Zero 2&quot; was also No. 1 in the category of &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot;, No. 9 in &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, No. 6 in &quot;Best Direction&quot;, and No. 4 in &quot;Best VGM (Video Game Music)&quot;. Dan Hibiki and Sakura Kasugano were depicted on the cover of this issue, who were placed No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the Top 50 Characters of 1996, with Ryu at No. 13, Zangief at No. 18 (sharing the spot with Mature from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;), Guy at No. 26, Chun-Li at No. 32, Akuma at No. 37 (sharing the spot with two other characters), Rolento at No. 45 (sharing the spot with the Elf from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara&quot;) and Ken at No. 49 (sharing the spot with two other characters).

===Ports===
The Saturn and PlayStation ports both received praise for their faithfulness to their arcade counterpart, large selection of characters, and replacement of the easily exploited chain combo system from the original &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;. Some critics, while acknowledging that the 2D fighting game genre was outdated, held &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; to be equal or even superior to any of the 3D fighting games then on the market. The Saturn version tied with the PlayStation version of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s &quot;Game of the Month&quot;. Though &quot;EGM&quot; never reviewed the PlayStation version of &quot;Alpha 2&quot;, in an overview of fighting games released in 1996 Sushi-X commented, &quot;Both the Saturn and PlayStation versions are great, but the Saturn version has a few advantages&quot;, citing frames of animation that were missing from the PlayStation version and the Saturn-exclusive illustrations mode. The following year, &quot;EGM&quot; named the Saturn version the 36th best console video game of all time, saying they chose the Saturn version specifically due to its superior graphics.

The Saturn port was also a commercial success, selling over 400,000 units in Japan.

The Super NES version was much less well-received, with reviews commenting that the sound quality is exceptionally poor, the animation is choppy, and the overambitious graphics cause the game to play at an agonizingly slow speed, compounded by bouts of slowdown when performing special moves. Shawn Smith and Dan Hsu of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; deemed it the worst &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game for the Super NES. Most critics were more forgiving, concluding that, despite the port&#x27;s flaws, it was a decent buy for gamers who did not own a Saturn or PlayStation. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game 96th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot; saying the game pushed the limits of the SNES and so had to make some compromises, and concluded: &quot;But it&#x27;s hard to fault the effort, and that&#x27;s why it deserves this rank and recognition.&quot; In 2018, Complex listed the game 71st in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; saying the game had loading times before the fights and graphics that were not as good as on the other ports, concluding, &quot;Nonetheless, the gameplay was still on point, and the bells and whistles were pretty amazing for an SNES game. We loved it.&quot;
