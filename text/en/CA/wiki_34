<text>David Cyril Eric Swarbrick (5 April 1941 – 3 June 2016) was an English folk musician and singer-songwriter. He was one of the most highly regarded musicians produced by the second British folk revival, contributing to some of the most important groups and projects of the 1960s, and he became a much sought-after session musician, which led him throughout his career to work with many of the major figures in folk and folk rock music.

A member of Fairport Convention from 1969, he assisted on their influential album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; (1969) which is credited with initiating the British folk rock movement. This, and his subsequent career, helped create greater interest in British traditional music and was also influential within mainstream rock. After 1970 he emerged as Fairport Convention&#x27;s leading figure and guided the band through a series of important albums until their temporary disbandment in 1979. Fairport Convention claimed in 1998 on &quot;The Cropredy Box&quot; album, that his style has been copied or developed by almost every British and many world folk violin players who have followed him.

He also played in a series of smaller, acoustic units and engaged in solo projects. He maintained a massive output of recordings and a significant profile and made a major contribution to the interpretation of traditional British music.

==History==

===Early career to 1968===
Swarbrick was born on 5 April 1941 in Stoneleigh, Surrey. His family moved to Linton, near Grassington, North Yorkshire, where he learned to play the violin. In the late 1940s the family moved to Birmingham, where he attended Birmingham College of Art (now absorbed into the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design at Birmingham City University) in the late 1950s, with the intention of becoming a printer. After winning a talent contest with his skiffle band, playing guitar, he was introduced to Beryl and Roger Marriott, influential local folk musicians. The Marriotts took him under their wing and Beryl, discovering that he had played the violin classically up until the skiffle craze, actively encouraged him to switch back to the fiddle and he joined the Beryl Marriott Ceilidh Band.

He joined the Ian Campbell Folk Group in 1960 and embarked on his recording career, playing on one single, three EPs and seven albums with the group over the next few years. He contributed significantly to the BBC Radio Ballads series on recordings with the three most important figures in the British folk movement of the time A. L. Lloyd, Ewan MacColl, and MacColl&#x27;s wife Peggy Seeger, as well as part of several collections to which the Ian Campbell Group contributed.

From 1965 he began to work with Martin Carthy, supporting him on his eponymous first album. The association was such a success that the next recording, &quot;Second Album&quot; (1966), gave them equal billing. They produced another four highly regarded recordings between 1967 and 1968, including &quot;Byker Hill&quot; (1967), whose innovative arrangements of traditional songs made it one of the most influential folk albums of the decade. Swarbrick also played on albums by Julie Felix, A. L. Lloyd and on the radio ballads, and became perhaps the most highly regarded interpreter of traditional material on the violin and certainly one of the most sought-after session musicians.

In 1967, Swarbrick released his first solo album Rags, Reels and Airs (Topic), with guests Martin Carthy and Diz Disley, which has since become a benchmark for generations of folk fiddlers.

===Session work and Fairport Convention in 1969–79===
In 1969, Swarbrick was working as a session musician. During recording sessions for the &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; album, Fairport Convention&#x27;s manager, Joe Boyd, hired Swarbrick to play some overdubs on the Richard Thompson-penned track &quot;Cajun Woman&quot;. Fairport had decided to play a traditional song &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot;, which Swarbrick had previously recorded with Carthy in 1969, and he was asked to contribute fiddle to the session. The result was an eleven-minute mini-epic that appeared on the 1969 album &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; and which marked out a new direction for the band.

Subsequently, Swarbrick was asked to join the group and was the first fiddler on the folk scene to electrify the violin. Martin Carthy later recalled that Swarbrick had been indecisive about joining, telling Carthy: &quot;I just played with this guy Richard [Thompson] and I want to play with him for the rest of my life.&quot; Together, now with Swarbrick co-writing with Richard Thompson &quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot;, they created the groundbreaking album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; (1969). His energetic and unique fiddle style was essential to the new sound and direction of the band, most marked on the medley of four jigs and reels that Swarbrick arranged for the album and which were to become an essential part of almost every subsequent Fairport performance. Before the album was released, key members of the band, founder Ashley Hutchings and singer, guitarist and songwriter Sandy Denny left, and Swarbrick stayed on with the band full-time, excited by the possibilities of performing traditional music in a rock context. His greater maturity, knowledge of folk song, reputation and personality meant that he soon emerged as the leading force in the band and continued to be so for the next decade, encouraging the band to bring in Dave Pegg, another graduate of the Ian Campbell Folk Group, on bass. However, Swarbrick was already beginning to suffer the hearing problems that would dog the rest of his career.

The first album of this new line-up, &quot;Full House&quot; (1970), although not as commercially successful as &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, sold relatively well, and remains highly regarded. Like &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; it contained interpretations of traditional tunes, including the epic &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; and another instrumental arranged by Swarbrick, &quot;Dirty Linen&quot;, but also contained songs jointly penned by Swarbrick and guitarist Richard Thompson, including what would become their opening live song &quot;Walk Awhile&quot;, and the nine-minute long anti-war anthem &quot;Sloth&quot;. The partnership produced another three songs on &quot;Full House&quot;. However, the fruitful collaboration was ended when Thompson departed the band soon after. The song &quot;Sloth&quot; has since been covered by other artists such as Plainsong and Nikki Sudden. After Swarbrick&#x27;s death 2016, in poet Ian McMillan recalled how &quot;his playing on Fairport Convention&#x27;s &quot;Sloth&quot; broke my heart every time&quot;.

As ex-Fairport Convention members embarked on their own careers, Swarbrick was often called upon to provide musical support, as he did for albums by Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson. He also played on some of the most significant folk albums of the era, including work by John Renbourn, Al Stewart and Peter Bellamy. In the second half of the 1970s, he began to release a series of solo albums.

Without Thompson, Swarbrick shouldered even more responsibility for leadership, writing and singing and the result was a folk-rock opera album &quot;&quot;Babbacombe&quot; Lee&quot;, mostly written by Swarbrick (telling the true story of John Babbacombe Lee, a man convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. The scaffold apparatus failed three times and Lee survived to spend much of his life in penal servitude). The result gained the band some mainstream attention, including a BBC TV programme devoted to the work, but was a mixed artistic achievement, with critics noting the lack of variety in the album. When Simon Nicol quit the band in 1971, Swarbrick was the longest-standing member and responsible for keeping the group afloat through a bewildering series of line-up changes and problematic projects.

The next album &quot;Rosie&quot; is chiefly notable for the title track, written by Swarbrick, which is perhaps the song most closely associated with him, but overall it was not a critical success. The following release, &quot;Nine&quot; (1974), relied heavily on the writing partnership between Swarbrick and new member Trevor Lucas, but it perhaps lacked the vitality of previous collaborations. The fortunes of the band rallied when Sandy Denny rejoined in 1974 and on the resulting album &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; Swarbrick took more of a backseat in writing and singing.

After Denny&#x27;s final departure from the band, Swarbrick managed to steer it through three more studio albums, turning a solo project into a Fairport album &quot;Gottle O&#x27;Geer&quot; (1976) and two albums for Vertigo; &quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tipplers Tales&quot; (1978), which sold poorly, but have since been seen as containing some of Swarbrick&#x27;s best fiddle work. However, all this was done amid financial and contractual difficulties and Swarbrick&#x27;s hearing problems were becoming severe and were aggravated by amplified performances. In 1979 the band played a farewell concert in Cropredy, Oxfordshire, then disbanded.

===Return to the folk circuit from 1980===
Apart from occasional reunions, particularly at the Cropredy Festival, Swarbrick&#x27;s performing career since 1980 focused on small venues and acoustic performances. His first project was a highly regarded duo with former Fairport guitarist Simon Nicol, which produced three albums. In 1984 Swarbrick decided to move to Scotland, while Nicol remained in Oxfordshire and the partnership dissolved. This also meant that he was unavailable when Fairport regrouped to record the album &quot;Gladys&#x27; Leap&quot; (1985). When the band re-formed in 1986 it did so without him, although he played with them on several occasions, particularly at the Cropredy Festival.

By the time of the Fairport reformation Swarbrick was already occupied with his next project as part of a quartet under the name Whippersnapper, with the highly regarded musicians Martin Jenkins, Chris Leslie and Kevin Dempsey. The group produced four albums between 1985 and 1989. From this point Swarbrick left to renew his partnership with Martin Carthy, but after two albums: &quot;Life And Limb&quot; (1990) and &quot;Skin And Bone&quot; (1992), he emigrated to Australia.

There he formed a new partnership with guitarist and singer-songwriter Alistair Hulett. They produced one album in Australia, &quot;Saturday Johnny and Jimmy The Rat&quot; (1996), and following Hulett and Swarbrick&#x27;s return to the UK soon after, made two more; &quot;The Cold Grey Light of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Red Clydeside&quot;. In this period Swarbrick guested on projects with some of the most highly regarded figures in folk rock, including Steve Ashley, John Kirkpatrick and Bert Jansch, as well as continuing with solo work and recording and touring with Martin Carthy. He also guested with artists who were not folk musicians. In 1991 he toured with ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band frontman Vivian Stanshall as part of Stanshall&#x27;s return to the live stage in &quot;Dog Ends&quot;.

For many years Swarbrick suffered steadily worsening health due to years of heavy smoking resulting in emphysema. There was considerable embarrassment for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper when in April 1999 it published a premature obituary for Swarbrick after he was admitted to hospital with a chest infection. He commented, &quot;It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve died in Coventry.&quot;

Dave and Christine Pegg launched SwarbAid, including a fund-raising concert at Birmingham&#x27;s Symphony Hall in July 1999 and releasing a limited-edition 1999 live EP &#x27;SwarbAid&#x27; with Fairport Convention in order to raise funds for Swarbrick whilst his poor health was preventing him from working. After another health relapse, they launched SwarbAid II, with a similar concert, in 2004. Swarbrick received a double lung transplant in October 2004 at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham and thereafter resumed his career with fervour, as a solo performer and annually on tour in the UK, every autumn, with Martin Carthy.

===Later work===
In 2006 Swarbrick resumed touring again with ex-Fairporter Maartin Allcock and Kevin Dempsey as Swarb&#x27;s Lazarus, producing the album &quot;Live and Kicking&quot; (2006); and appearing at the Cropredy Festival. The band&#x27;s name was chosen as a reference to the premature publishing of Swarbrick&#x27;s obituary, by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1999. On 10 August 2007, Swarbrick joined the 1969 Fairport Convention line-up at Cropredy with Chris While standing in for the late Sandy Denny, to perform the whole of the album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;. Most notably, The Liege &amp; Lief line-up plus Chris While had initially reformed to play at the BBC Radio 2 folk awards in the same year.

Swarbrick&#x27;s much lauded solo album &quot;Raison d&#x27;être (Shirty Records) w&quot;as released in July 2010.

In 2014 Swarbrick released a full-length album with the Canadian musician Jason Wilson entitled &quot;Lion Rampant&quot;. The critically acclaimed album included special guests Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Pee Wee Ellis and John Kirkpatrick.. Working with the Jason Wilson Band, brought Swarbrick back playing with a significant big group again, contributing to gigs playing around Canada and the UK. British Folk music critic Ken Hunt described the album: &quot;Head and shoulders, the most eclectic, catholic and coherent musical banquet of 2014 thus far.&quot; Their final studio album together; Kailyard Tales, was released on 12 January 2018.

In April and May 2014, Swarbrick completed a 17-venue tour of the UK, supported by folk trio Said the Maiden at his personal request. The tour, organised by Helen Meisner of the Folkstock Foundation, of which Swarbrick was the patron, also featured at each venue young, up-coming folk artists, several of them from the Folkstock stable.

Swarbrick and Carthy made their final UK tour in autumn 2015.

Swarbrick died from pneumonia on 3 June 2016, at hospital in Aberystwyth.

==Personal life==
Swarbrick was married several times. He had three children (Emily, Alexander and Isobel), eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His last marriage was to the painter Jill Swarbrick-Banks. They met in 1998 and married at Coventry Register Office the following year. They lived together in Coventry and mid-Wales until his death in June 2016.

==Awards==
In 2003, he was awarded a &#x27;Gold Badge&#x27; by the English Folk Dance and Song Society and the &#x27;Gold Badge of Merit&#x27; by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. In 2004 he was given a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. At the 2006 Folk Awards he shared with current and past Fairport Convention members when they received an award when their seminal album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was voted &#x27;Most Influential Folk Album of All Time&#x27; by Radio 2 listeners. At the 2007 awards Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick won the &#x27;Best Duo&#x27; Award.
At the 2012 Fatea Awards, Swarbrick was awarded The Life Time Achievement Award.

==Discography==

Taking account of his early work with the Ian Campbell Folk Group, as well as with Ewan MacColl, A. L. Lloyd and Peggy Seeger, and including his work as a guest musician on the albums of many artists, Swarbrick can be credited with over 167 album appearances.

<text>A collective is a group of entities that share or are motivated by at least one common issue or interest or work together to achieve a common objective. Collectives can differ from cooperatives in that they are not necessarily focused upon an economic benefit or saving, though they can be.

The term &quot;collective&quot; is sometimes used to describe a species as a whole—for example, the human collective.

For political purposes, a collective is defined by decentralized, or &quot;majority-rules&quot; decision-making styles.

==Types of groups==
Collectives are sometimes characterised by attempts to share and exercise political and social power and to make decisions on a consensus-driven and egalitarian basis.

A commune or intentional community, which may also be known as a &quot;collective household&quot;, is a group of people who live together in some kind of dwelling or residence, or in some other arrangement (e.g., sharing land). Collective households may be organized for a specific purpose (e.g., relating to business, parenting, or some other shared interest).

Artist collectives, including musical collectives, are typically a collection of individuals with similar interests in producing and documenting art as a group. These groups can range in size from a few people to thousands of members. The style of art produced can have vast differences. Motivations can be for a common cause or individually motivated purposes. Some collectives are simply people who enjoy painting with someone else and have no other goals or motivations for forming their collective.

A worker cooperative is a type of horizontal collective wherein a business functions as a partnership of individual professionals, recognizing them as equals and rewarding them for their expertise. The working collective aims to reduce costs to clients while maintaining healthy rewards for participating partners. This is accomplished by eliminating the operating costs that are needed to support levels of management.

<doc id="766370" wikidata="Q332074" url="?curid=766370" title="René Barrientos">
<text>René Emilio Barrientos Ortuño (30 May 1919 – 27 April 1969) was a Bolivian military officer and politician who served as the 47th president of Bolivia from 1964 to 1966 and 1966 to 1969. During his first term, he shared power with Alfredo Ovando as co-president of a military junta and was the 30th vice president of Bolivia in 1964.

General Barrientos came to power after the 1964 Bolivian coup d&#x27;état which overthrew the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro. During his three-year rule, Barrientos and the army suppressed leftist opposition to his regime, including a guerrilla group led by Che Guevara in 1967.

On 27 April 1969, Barrientos was killed in a helicopter crash near Arque, Bolivia. He may have been assassinated, but that has not been conclusively proven.

== Early years ==
Barrientos was a native of Tarata, department of Cochabamba. His father was of Spanish ancestry while his mother was Quechua. After his father died when he was a child, Barrientos was sent to a Franciscan orphanage. He left the orphanage at 12 and attended a private high school while working odd jobs to pay the tuition. After graduating, he entered the military academy in La Paz. He was a career military officer, graduating from the military academy in 1943 and earning his pilot&#x27;s license in 1945. Later in the 1940s, he gravitated toward the reformist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario, or MNR) party of Víctor Paz Estenssoro. Barrientos played a part in the Bolivian National Revolution of 1952, when the MNR toppled the established order and took power. In fact, he was given the task of flying out of the country to bring back the revolutionary leader Víctor Paz Estenssoro, then in exile, once the rebellion succeeded. In 1957, Barrientos was rewarded when he was named commander of the Bolivian Air Force.

== A new kind of general ==
Known as a rather obsequious, sycophantic supporter of the MNR, he slowly became famous throughout the country for his uncommon, and very public, feats of valor. In 1960, for example, a live parachute jump demonstration by Bolivian Air Force soldiers ended in disaster when their equipment failed and 3 of the 15 parachutists fell to their death before a large crowd assembled to view the event. Recriminations flew as to who should be held responsible for the carnage. Barrientos, as Air Force commander, decided to put on a demonstration of his own, and jumped from an airplane himself using one of the parachutes that had failed to open during the earlier debacle. His point was that there had been nothing wrong with the equipment or the training, simply bad luck; this incident cemented his popularity among certain sections of the population. Furthermore, the ruling MNR helped prop up his standing, as the MNR leadership constantly extolled General Barrientos&#x27; virtues, portraying him as a paragon of the new kind of military officer the revolution had fostered.

By the early 1960s, while the ruling MNR party had begun to fall apart due to personal and policy differences between its leading members, Barrientos&#x27; stock was clearly on the rise. In addition, President Paz Estenssoro (elected to a second term in 1960) was leaning more heavily on military support to restore order to various parts of the country where rival pro-MNR militias had turned against each other, often on behalf of specific MNR leaders. Disarming the militias (who had been allowed to keep their weapons since the 1952 Revolution) became a priority to Paz, and this enhanced the role the new armed forces played in the national arena. The most popular of these military leaders was, of course, the dashing Barrientos.

== Rise to power ==
In 1961, Paz Estenssoro had the Bolivian Constitution amended in order to be allowed to run for consecutive re-election, feeling that only he had the standing to keep the crumbling MNR together. Traditionally, attempts such as these (known as &quot;prorroguismo&quot;) have been strongly condemned by the Bolivian political elites, many of whose members may have been waiting for their turn to occupy the Presidential palace for years. This was no exception, and Paz&#x27;s controversial move would soon prove harmful to him. Paz, surprisingly to some, chose General Barrientos as his running mate in that year&#x27;s elections, and the two were sworn in on 6 August 1964. Just three months later, Barrientos — in tandem with the Army Commander Alfredo Ovando — toppled Paz in a violent coup d&#x27;état and installed himself as co-president in a Junta alongside General Ovando.

His idea all along was to capitalize on his popularity and run for elections, with the full support of the Bolivian military establishment now in control of the country. To this end, he resigned his co-presidency in early 1966 and registered himself as a candidate for president in the general elections that were held in July 1966. With the most important civilian leaders (Paz, Hernán Siles and Juan Lechín) in exile, Barrientos was easily elected, and was sworn in during August 1966.

== Barrientos as constitutional president ==
General Barrientos was quite charismatic, and was throughout his presidency popular with ordinary Bolivians, aided by the fluency with which he spoke Quechua, the most important native language among the Bolivian peasantry.

Barrientos was skilled at manipulating the masses with his oratory, which often allowed him to present himself as both a populist and conservative, a revolutionary and a &quot;law-and-order&quot; advocate. Purporting to be a staunch Christian, Barrientos actively courted the church, and in fact, chose as his running mate in the 1966 elections the leader of the small Christian Democrat Party of Bolivia, Dr. Luis Adolfo Siles. He was fiercely anti-communist and pro-free market. Accepting more military aid and acquiescing to the training of special forces designed to combat possible communist-inspired insurgencies (under the aegis of the Alliance for Progress) made Barrientos particularly popular with Washington.

==The 1967 guerrilla insurgency==

Barrientos had ample opportunity to prove his anti-Communist credentials in 1967, when a guerrilla force was discovered to be operating in the Bolivian southeast under the leadership of the Argentine-Cuban revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara in the Bolivian jungle. Barrientos was very concerned with Guevara&#x27;s alleged popularity among the miners in the southwestern part of the country, and clamped down in the area with some very heavy-handed measures (such as the San Juan massacre). Guevara felt that such an atrocity by the Bolivian Army and Air Force would be the tipping point in his favour in rallying the miners to his communist cause, but eventually the miners signed an agreement with the government-owned mining company Siglo XX, which agreement Guevara felt undermined his reason for being there. The war between the national forces under President Barrientos and Che Guevara&#x27;s militia did not end there, but eventually the Bolivian Army Rangers captured Guevara and executed him in October 1967. Barrientos had directly ordered Guevara&#x27;s execution after his capture.

==Political troubles and Barrientos&#x27; death==
While temporarily enhancing the president&#x27;s stature, this only started more troubles for Barrientos. While the army was fighting the guerrillas, the miners of Siglo XX (a state-owned Bolivian mining town) declared themselves in support of the insurgency, prompting the president to send troops to regain control. This led to the San Juan massacre, when soldiers opened fire on the miners and killed around 30 men and women on Saint John&#x27;s Day, called Día de San Juan in Spanish, 24 June 1967. Further, a major scandal erupted in 1968 when Barrientos&#x27; trusted friend and Minister of Interior, Antonio Arguedas, disappeared with the captured diary of Che Guevara, which soon surfaced in, of all places, Havana. From abroad, Arguedas confessed himself to have been a clandestine Marxist supporter, denouncing Barrientos and many of his aides as being on the CIA&#x27;s payroll. The episode embarrassed the administration and cast doubts about the president&#x27;s judgment (after all, it was he who was friends with, and had appointed, Arguedas to the most important ministry post in the government).

In the aftermath of the mining massacres and anti-guerrilla campaign, Barrientos was seen by some as a brutal dictator at the service of foreign interests while masquerading as a democrat. Eager to do some damage control and repair his once-excellent relations with the campesinos (Bolivian farm workers), the president took to traveling throughout the country to present his position, even to the smallest and remotest of Bolivian villages. It was a tactic that had yielded him good results in the past and Barrientos hoped to rebuild his political capital. However, on 27 April 1969, a Hiller OH-23 helicopter of the Bolivian Air Force (nicknamed Holofernes) that was carrying him struck telephone cables near Arque, killing Barrientos, his aide-de-camp and the pilot. An assassination has been considered a possibility but never proven.

The 1801 census recorded Sandiacre&#x27;s population as 405; by 1901 this had risen to 2,954, with the 1971 census reporting a population of 7,792. The current population is now hovering at an estimated 9,000.

The discovery of local ironstone led to the development of Stanton Ironworks in 1787. 

The Erewash Canal passes through the centre of Sandiacre, and the small basin immediately above Sandiacre Lock (No. 11 on the canal) was once the terminal link of the now-defunct Derby Canal. Situated next to the canal in the centre of Sandiacre is the Springfield Mill; it was built in 1888 as a lace mill and a reminder of Sandiacre&#x27;s industrial heritage, and has since been converted into a modern apartment complex. The building suffered a large fire in April 2020, which caused extensive damage.

Examples of lace making and furniture making can still be found today.

The country&#x27;s largest railway depot, Toton TMD, is located immediately south-east of Sandiacre, just over the border into Nottinghamshire.

==Transport==
Sandiacre was once served by Stapleford and Sandiacre railway station, which was situated along the border with Stapleford on the Erewash Valley line. It was opened in 1847 and closed in 1967.

The nearest National Rail station is now at Long Eaton, which is sited on the Midland Main Line. It is served by East Midlands Railway&#x27;s inter-city services between Sheffield and London St Pancras, via Chesterfield, Derby and Leicester; they also provide services between Newark Castle, Derby and Crewe, and between Nottingham and Matlock. 
CrossCountry provide services between Nottingham, Birmingham and Cardiff.

Bus services in Sandiacre are provided primarily by Trent Barton and CT4N. Routes connect Sandiacre with Nottingham, Beeston, Stapleford, Long Eaton, Derby, East Midlands Airport and Ilkeston.

Junction 25 of the M1 motorway lies in Sandiacre, where it crosses the A52 Brian Clough Way.

==Schools==
The schools in Sandiacre are Ladycross Infants School, Cloudside Academy junior school and Friesland School – a secondary school with sixth form.

==Sport==
=== Football ===
Sandiacre Town F.C. (established in 1978) play at St. Giles&#x27; Park. The first team compete in the Nottinghamshire Senior League Premier Division.

=== Cricket ===
Sandiacre Town Cricket Club (established in 1877) play at the ground on Longmoor Lane. Sandiacre Town CC compete in the Derbyshire County Cricket League; the top level for recreational club cricket in Derbyshire, England, and is a designated ECB Premier League. Since the League was founded in 1999, Sandiacre have won 6 Championship league titles: 2002, 2004, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2021. They have also been the winners of the ECB National Club Cricket Championship in 2003 and 2014.

<doc id="766372" wikidata="Q4572234" url="?curid=766372" title="1966 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1966 Atlantic hurricane season saw the Weather Bureau office in Miami, Florida, be designated as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and assume responsibility of tropical cyclone forecasting in the basin. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was an above-average season in terms of tropical storms, with a total of 15. The first system, Hurricane Alma, developed over eastern Nicaragua on June 4 and became a rare major hurricane in the month of June. Alma brought severe flooding to Honduras and later to Cuba, but caused relatively minor impact in the Southeastern United States. Alma resulted in 90 deaths and about $210 million (1966 USD) in damage.

The unnamed June tropical storm and Becky, Celia, Dorothy, and Ella all resulted in little to no impact on land. The next system, Hurricane Faith, developed near Cape Verde on August 21. It tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean until north of Hispaniola. After paralleling the East Coast of the United States, Faith moved northeastward across the open Atlantic and later became extratropical on September 4. Although it never made landfall, Faith and its remnants generated rough seas that resulted in four deaths, with one over the open Atlantic and the other four offshore Denmark. The two next tropical storms – Greta and Hallie – caused negligible impact.

The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Inez, a powerful Category 5 hurricane that devastated a large majority of the Caribbean, the Florida Keys, and parts of Mexico. Throughout its path, the storm caused about $222.5 million in damage and more than 1,000 deaths. Following Inez, the other cyclones reaching at least tropical storm intensity, Judith, Kendra, Lois, and two unnamed systems in November did not result in significant impacts on land. The final system, an unnamed tropical storm, degenerated into a trough over the western Atlantic on November 26.

== Season summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1. During the year, the Miami, Florida, Weather Bureau office was re-designated the National Hurricane Center. It was an above average season in which fifteen tropical storms formed, compared with the 1966–2009 average of 11.3 named storms. Seven of these reached hurricane status, slightly above of the 1966–2009 average of 6.2, and three of those reached major hurricane status, with the 1950–2000 mean being 2.3. In all, three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall in 1966. Also, collectively, the season&#x27;s storms caused at least 1,094 fatalities and about $432.6 million (1966 USD) in damage. The season officially ended on November 30.

The first storm, Hurricane Alma, developed over eastern Nicaragua on June 4. Alma crossed the Caribbean and struck Cuba. The storm made another landfall in Florida as a hurricane on June 9. This marked the earliest United States hurricane landfall since a hurricane in May and June of 1825. Alma continued northeastward across the Southeastern United States until becoming extratropical offshore Virginia on June 13. Later that month, another tropical depression developed. The month of July was highly active, with four named storms – Becky, Celia, Dorothy, and Ella. Additionally, a tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico. However, tropical cyclogenesis then halted for more than three weeks, until Hurricane Faith developed on August 21. On average, three or four named storms form in August.

Four tropical cyclones developed in September, including tropical storms Greta, Hallie and Judith, as well as Hurricane Inez. Peaking as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of , Inez was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. Although Inez persisted into October, no other system developed that month. Two named storms usually form in October. The final formally named storm, Hurricane Lois, existed from November 4 to November 11.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 145. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==

=== Hurricane Alma ===
A westward-moving tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and reached Central America in early June. Land interaction initially slowed development. However, after the wave turned northward and reemerged into the Caribbean, it quickly organized into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on June 5. While moving through Honduras, the precursor system dropped heavy rainfall that killed at least 73 people in the city of San Rafael. Offshore northern Honduras, the system produced heavy rainfall on Swan Island. The depression moved north-northeastward and intensified into Tropical Storm Alma around 00:00 UTC on June 6, about 18 hours before becoming a hurricane. After strengthening into a Category 2 hurricane on June 8, Alma made two landfalls in Cuba, first on Isla de la Juventud with winds of and then near Guanimar, Artemisa Province, at a slightly stronger intensity. Havana observed wind gusts up to . The hurricane caused heavy crop damage and water shortages. Over 1,000 houses were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $200 million. The storm killed 12 people in the country.

After emerging into the Straights of Florida around 13:00 UTC on June 8, Alma continued to intensify and reached major hurricane intensity five hours later. The storm then peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of as it passed between Dry Tortugas and Key West, Florida. The latter reported power outages and flooding. Alma dropped heavy rainfall and produced winds across most of Florida, which damaged crops and caused scattered power outages. The cyclone weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before moving ashore near St. Marks, Florida, late on June 9 with winds of . This was the earliest date of landfall in the United States since 1825. Damage in Florida was estimated at $10 million, and there were six deaths in the state. Alma crossed southeastern Georgia as a tropical storm, damaging a few houses and causing light damage. The storm re-intensified into a hurricane over the western Atlantic Ocean around 12:00 UTC on June 11, and its outer rainbands dropped heavy precipitation in Wilmington, North Carolina. Alma encountered colder water temperatures and weakened back to tropical storm intensity late on the following day, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone east of the Outer Banks. The remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by a frontal boundary just offshore Massachusetts on June 14. 
=== June tropical storm ===

A strong tropical wave developed into a tropical depression in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 28. The depression moved slowly northward and although it remained poorly defined throughout its duration, the system intensified into a tropical storm early the following day. Also despite being described as poorly defined, the wind field was well organized, especially in the northeastern quadrant. Around 14:00 UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall on Cuba&#x27;s south coast just west of the modern-day border of Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces with winds of . The cyclone emerged into the Straights of Florida several hours later. Early on June 30, the system peaked with sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of while approaching the Florida Keys. Continuing northward, the storm passed just west of the Tampa Bay area on July 1 before striking Cedar Key at 22:00 UTC with winds of . The system curved northeastward and weakened to a tropical depression over southern Georgia at 06:00 UTC on July 2, about 12 hours before dissipating.

The storm spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed two aircraft at Palm Beach International Airport; the other touched down in Vero Beach and caused minimal effects. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in some areas of Florida, with a peak total of in Everglade City and Jacksonville. The precipitation in Jacksonville resulted in $50,000 in damage to roadways. Additionally, the cyclone brought &quot;beneficial rains&quot; to South Carolina.
=== Hurricane Becky ===
In late June, a weakening frontal boundary and an upper-level trough traversed the western Atlantic. A significant convective flare occurred along the tail-end of the frontal system between the Bahamas and Bermuda on June 27. The frontal system also began interacting with the northern part of a westward-moving tropical wave over the Caribbean. After a well-defined center developed on June 30, the system became a subtropical depression near Bermuda at 12:00 UTC. Six hours later, the cyclone intensified into a subtropical storm. Based on satellite imagery, the system transitioned into a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC on July 1. Becky continued to intensify while heading northeastward under an upper-level trough. The storm reached hurricane status by midday on July 2, six hours before peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, Becky soon began weakening and losing tropical characteristics, becoming an extratropical cyclone early on July 3. A cold low then caused the remnants of Becky to turn northwest toward Atlantic Canada, before being absorbed by another extratropical system to the north several hours later.
=== Hurricane Celia ===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression west of the Leeward Islands at 00:00 UTC on July 13. Six hours later, ship reports indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Celia. However, because satellite imagery showed only a weak swirl with convection sheared well to the southeast, Celia degenerated back to a tropical wave early on July 14 north of Puerto Rico while moving westward. While nearing the central Bahamas late on July 18, the remnants of Celia regenerated into a tropical depression after regaining a low-level circulation. That day, Celia turned northward back into the open Atlantic. Observations from a ship indicate that Celia re-strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 20 as it accelerated northeastward ahead of a frontal boundary. The storm intensified significantly throughout the day, reaching hurricane status at 18:00 UTC. Celia then peaked with sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of . The cyclone soon began to weaken, falling to tropical storm intensity at 06:00 UTC on July 21. Six hours later, Celia transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which struck eastern Nova Scotia late on July 21 and then dissipated over Labrador on the following day.

Only light rainfall was observed in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, with a peak total of in Nova Scotia. Portions of Newfoundland experienced wind gusts up to .
=== Hurricane Dorothy ===

In late July, a low-level disturbance situated over the central Atlantic Ocean encountered a vigorous shortwave trough and developed into a surface low-pressure area on July 21. Initially, the depression had extratropical features and lacked tropical characteristics, such as a warm core and a well-developed central dense overcast. A weather ship in the area indicated an influx of baroclinity, suggesting that Dorothy derived its energy through non-tropical processes. Around 06:00 UTC on July 23, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy. Thereafter, it moved in quasi-stationary motion to the northwest and continued to intensify, reaching hurricane status late on July 24.

Upon reaching hurricane intensity, Dorothy possessed tropical characteristics, with evidence of a weak warm core beginning on July 25. The hurricane moved in a semi-circular path, and at 12:00 UTC the next day, Dorothy attained its minimum barometric pressure of . Later on July 26, the system curved north-northeastward. Further strengthening occurred and at 00:00 UTC on July 28, Dorothy attained its maximum sustained wind speed of . Moving across colder sea surface temperatures, the hurricane began weakening and fell to tropical storm status early on July 29. Dorothy continued to weaken and became extratropical around 18:00 UTC the following day, while located about north-northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores. The remnants continued northwestward and dissipated on July 31.
=== Tropical Storm Ella ===

On July 20, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. The wave organized while moving westward and developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on July 22. The depression initially moved west-northwestward at approximately and slowly intensified. Early on July 24, the cyclone strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella and peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Ella remained poorly organized throughout its duration and weakened back to a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on July 28, due to outflow from Hurricane Dorothy. Although Ella soon dissipated, its remnants turned northward and persisted until being absorbed by a frontal boundary two days later.
=== Hurricane Faith ===
An area of disturbed weather emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa in mid-August. It developed into a tropical depression while located between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking westward, the depression intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23. However, Faith weakened back to a tropical storm early on August 26 while approaching the Lesser Antilles, before re-gaining hurricane status about 24 hours later. The outer bands of Faith produced gale-force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor damage to boats and jetties occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. After curving north-northwestward near the Bahamas, Faith briefly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on August 28, reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of . The storm then weakened and fluctuated in intensity between Category 2 and Category 1 over the next few days. Faith remained well offshore the East Coast of the United States, turning northeastward on August 31 and then eastward on September 2.

Re-intensifying into a Category 3 hurricane early on September 3, Faith then attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm resumed a northeastward motion and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane early on September 4, before becoming extratropical about east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical remnants continued northeastward and later east-northeastward across the far north Atlantic. On September 6, the remnants of Faith passed near the Faroe Islands, several hours before striking Norway and crossing Scandinavia. Thereafter, the system meandered over the Soviet Union and the Arctic Ocean for the next several days, until finally becoming unidentifiable near Franz Josef Land on September 15. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm. In Norway, heavy rainfall from the storm caused record high glacier melting, flooding some areas. 
=== Tropical Storm Greta ===

A tropical wave traversed the Atlantic well east of the Windward Islands in late August. The wave developed into a tropical depression about east of Barbados at 12:00 UTC on September 1, based on Nimbus 2 satellite imagery showing that a circulation formed within the cloud mass. The depression moved west-northwestward and remained weak and disorganized, with convection highly sheared on its east side. Based on reconnaissance flight data, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta early on September 4. Based on reconnaissance data, ship reports, and the pressure-wind relationship, Greta is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of several hours later. The cyclone slowly weakened thereafter, falling to tropical depression intensity early on September 6. Around 18:00 UTC that day, Greta degenerated into an open trough, which turned northward over the western Atlantic before being absorbed by a frontal system on September 8.
=== Tropical Storm Hallie ===

Satellite imagery from ESSA 2 indicated that a large area of disturbed weather began merging with a frontal band in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. After an increase in convective activity and satellite imagery revealing a closed circulation on September 20, the system was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hallie. After initially remaining stationary, Hallie eventually began a southwestward drift toward Mexico. Early on September 21, Hallie peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, the storm abruptly weakened to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC due to cool, dry air and land interaction. Although post-season analysis indicated that Hallie soon made landfall near Nautla, Veracruz, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that the cyclone remained offshore and dissipated just after 18:00 UTC. The remnants of Hallie produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to at Nautla.
=== Hurricane Inez ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression well east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. It moved slowly westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Inez on September 24. The storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the French overseas region of Guadeloupe on September 27. After entering the Caribbean, Inez briefly weakened before a rapid intensification trend ensued, attaining peak sustained winds of on September 28. Continuing westward, Inez made landfall on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. Inez then struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September 30. The hurricane moved slowly over Cuba for two days before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. Inez stalled and later resumed its previous westward path. Between October 4 and October 5, the storm moved west-southwestward across the Florida Keys. Entering the Gulf of Mexico, Inez began to slowly re-strengthen. On October 10, Inez made landfall near Tampico as a Category 3 hurricane. The storm weakened rapidly and dissipated over Guanajuato on October 11.

In Guadeloupe, Inez severely damaged the island&#x27;s banana and sugar crops, and thousands of homes were damaged, leaving 10,000 people homeless. There were 40 deaths and damage totaled approximately $50 million. The storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800 houses in Dominican Republic. There were about 100 deaths and $12 million in damage. In Haiti, as many as 1,000 people were killed, and 60,000 people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35 million. About 125,000 people were forced to evacuate in Cuba, and there were three deaths and $20 million in damage. In the Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5 million in damage. Hurricane-force winds were observed in the Florida Keys, where 160 homes and 190 trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5 million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45 people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11 people. Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages in the Yucatán Peninsula. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000 people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500 houses. Damage was estimated at $104 million, and there were 74 deaths in Mexico.
=== Tropical Storm Judith ===

On September 26 and September 27, satellite imagery and ships monitored an area of disturbed weather located to the east of the Lesser Antilles and following Hurricane Inez. Based on reports of a circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on September 27. The depression intensified slowly and became Tropical Storm Judith around midday on September 28. While centered north of Barbados the next day, Judith attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of , both of which were observed by a reconnaissance aircraft flight. Shortly thereafter, the storm crossed through the Windward Islands and weakened to a tropical depression, possibly due to entering the outflow of Inez. At 12:00 UTC on September 30, Judith dissipated over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Winds up to were observed on Martinique.
=== Tropical Storm Kendra ===

A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on October 2 and spawned an area of disturbed weather that steadily organized as it moved northward between Africa and Cabo Verde. It became a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on October 3 and maintained that strength for a few days. On October 7, a ship measured winds, the impetus for upgrading the depression to Tropical Storm Kendra. The organized nature of the system on satellite imagery suggested it may have become a tropical storm as early as October 4, but the sparsity of observations precluded an upgrade. The cyclone curved toward the southwest and began to weaken as its convection dissipated. At 00:00 UTC on October 10, it degenerated to a remnant low which dissipated into an open trough over the central Atlantic the next day. Kendra has been the focus of multiple analyses, as it was originally classified as a tropical storm, revoked as a tropical cyclone in post-season review, and finally re-designated as a tropical storm during reanalysis.
=== Hurricane Lois ===

A vortex within an area of low pressure developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on November 4, while located about east-southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the depression featured cold temperatures near the center and did not completely possess tropical characteristics. During the next few days, the depression organized further and acquired a warmer center of circulation while heading west-southwestward and then to the east-southeast. Late on November 6, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lois, based on reconnaissance aircraft flight observations.
Passing west of the Azores on November 10, a sustained wind speed of was observed on Corvo Island. Moving over colder ocean waters, at 18:00 UTC on November 10 Lois transitioned from a hurricane into an extratropical storm while located about north of São Miguel Island. Transitioning at 42.7N, this made Lois the farthest north an Atlantic hurricane has traveled in the month of November on record, until surpassed by Hurricane Martin in 2022. The remnants curved southeastward while weakening until dissipating a few hundred miles offshore Portugal at 06:00 UTC on November 14.
=== Mid November tropical storm ===

On November 13, an area of low pressure developed in the eastern Atlantic at the tail-end of a cold front connected to the extratropical remnants of Lois. Surface observations and satellite imagery suggest a subtropical storm formed at 18:00 UTC that day. The system moved west and slowly shed its frontal boundaries; it is thus analyzed to have become a tropical storm on November 14. The small system developed organized banding features, and ship observations support it reaching winds of at least , although the sparsity of data suggests it could have become a hurricane. The storm began curving poleward and passed west of the Azores on November 17, where it intercepted cold, dry air and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 18:00 UTC that day.
=== Late November tropical storm ===

Similar to the previous system, an area of low pressure developed at the tail-end of a front over the central Atlantic on November 19. After persisting as an extratropical cyclone for a few days, the northeast-moving system acquired characteristics of a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on November 22. Two days later, it reached peak winds of as it curved toward the northwest. An intensifying non-tropical low progressing across the western Atlantic increased shear over the system, causing it to open up into a trough around 00:00 UTC on November 26.
=== Other systems ===
There were also two weaker tropical cyclones during the season.

A tropical depression was reported to have existed in late July. A tropical low-pressure area moved across Florida and entered the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 24. By the following day, coastal radars indicated a relatively well-defined circulation. As a result, it is estimated that the system became a tropical depression later on July 25. After minimal intensification, the depression made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana early on July 26. The depression then curved westward and dissipated on the next day. Other than heavy thunderstorms and a brief suspension of fishing activities, no other effects were reported.

There was a report of a tropical depression that lasted from September 27 to 30.
== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1966. Storms were named &quot;Dorothy&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hallie&quot;, &quot;Inez&quot;, &quot;Kendra&quot; and &quot;Lois&quot; for the first time in 1966.

=== Retirement ===

Early in 1967, at the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Hurricane Warning Conference, the name &quot;Faith&quot; was removed from the naming list. And later, following the 1969 interdepartmental conference, &quot;Inez&quot; was retired from further use as an Atlantic tropical cyclone name. &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Inez&quot; were replaced with &quot;Felice&quot; and &quot;Isabel&quot;, respectively, when the 1966 list was used again for the 1970 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the tropical cyclones that formed in the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1966 USD.

<doc id="766374" wikidata="Q467929" url="?curid=766374" title="Luis García Meza">
<text>Luis García Meza Tejada (8 August 1929 – 29 April 2018) was a Bolivian general who served as the &quot;de facto&quot; 57th president of Bolivia from 1980 to 1981. He was a dictator convicted of human rights violations and leader of a violent coup. A native of La Paz, he was a career military officer who rose to the rank of general during the dictatorship of Hugo Banzer (1971–78).

==Prelude to dictatorship==
García Meza graduated from the military academy in 1952, and served as its commander from 1963 to 1964. He then rose to division commander in the late 1970s.

He became the leader of the right-wing faction of the military of Bolivia most disenchanted with the return to civilian rule. Many of the officers involved had been part of the Hugo Banzer dictatorship and disliked the investigation of economic and human rights abuses by the new Bolivian congress. Moreover, they tended to regard the decline in popularity of the Carter administration in the United States as an indicator that soon a Republican administration would replace it—one more amenable to the kind of pro-US, more hardline anti-communist dictatorship they wanted to reinstall in Bolivia. Many allegedly had ties to cocaine traffickers and made sure portions of the military acted as their enforcers/protectors in exchange for extensive bribes, which in turn were used to fund the upcoming coup. In this manner, the narcotraffickers were in essence purchasing for themselves the upcoming Bolivian government.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

This group pressured President Lidia Gueiler (his cousin) to install General García Meza as Commander of the Army. Within months, the Junta of Commanders headed by García Meza forced a violent &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, sometimes referred to as the Cocaine Coup, of 17 July 1980, when several Bolivian intellectuals such as Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz were killed. When portions of the citizenry resisted, as they had done in the failed putsch of November 1979, it resulted in dozens of deaths. Many were tortured. Allegedly, the Argentine Army unit Batallón de Inteligencia 601 participated in the coup.

==Dictatorship, 1980-81==
Of rightwing ultra-conservative anti-communist persuasion, García Meza endeavored to bring a Pinochet-style dictatorship that was intended to last 20 years. He immediately outlawed all political parties, exiled opposition leaders, repressed trade unions and muzzled the press. He was backed by the Argentinian Military Junta and the Italian neofascist Stefano Delle Chiaie. Further collaboration came from other European neofascists, most notoriously Spanish Ernesto Milá Rodríguez (accused of the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing). Among other foreign collaborators were professional torturers allegedly imported from the notoriously repressive Argentine dictatorship of General Jorge Videla.

The García Meza regime, while brief (its original form ended in 1981), became internationally known for its extreme brutality. The population was repressed in the same ways as under the Banzer dictatorship. In January 1981, the Council on Hemispheric Affairs named the García Meza regime, &quot;Latin America&#x27;s most errant violator of human rights after Guatemala and El Salvador.&quot; Some 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the Bolivian Army and security forces in only 13 months. The administration&#x27;s chief repressor was the Minister of Interior, Colonel Luis Arce, who cautioned that all Bolivians who opposed the new order should &quot;walk around with their written will under their arms.&quot;

The most prominent victim of the dictatorship was the congressman, presidential candidate, and gifted orator Marcelo Quiroga, murdered and &quot;disappeared&quot; soon after the coup. Quiroga had been the chief advocate of bringing to trial the former dictator, General Hugo Banzer (who was in power from 1971 until 1978), for human right violations and economic mismanagement.

===Drug trafficking===
The García Meza government&#x27;s drug trafficking activities led to the complete isolation of the regime. In contrast to his position regarding the other military dictatorships in Latin America, the new conservative U.S. President Ronald Reagan kept his distance, as the regime&#x27;s unsavory links to criminal circles became more public. Eventually, the international outcry was sufficiently strong to force García Meza&#x27;s resignation on 3 August 1981. He was succeeded by a less tainted but equally repressive general, Celso Torrelio.

The Bolivian military would sustain itself in power only for another year, and would then retreat to its barracks, embarrassed and tarnished by the excesses of the 1980–82 dictatorships (it has never returned to the Palacio Quemado).

==Exile and jail==
García Meza left the country but was tried and convicted in absentia for the serious human rights violations committed by his regime. on march 14, 1995, he was extradited to Bolivia from Brazil and was given a 30-year prison sentence, at the San Pedro&#x27;s penitentiary in La Paz, the very same penitentiary where he once kept his enemies. His main collaborator, Colonel Arce, was extradited to the United States, where he served a prison sentence for drug trafficking.

García Meza had reportedly been living in considerable comfort whilst in prison, with a barbecue, a gym, and a telephone at his disposal, in addition with a sauna and the occupation of three cells. These privileges were later revoked in response to protests from human rights organisations and victims.

==Death==
García Meza died at the Cossmil military hospital, where he was serving the remainder of his 30-year prison term in La Paz on April 29, 2018, of a heart attack at the age of 88.

<text>Lúcio Marçal Ferreira Ribeiro Lima Costa (27 February 1902 – 13 June 1998) was a Brazilian architect and urban planner, best known for his plan for Brasília.

==Early life==
Costa was born in Toulon, France, the son of Brazilian parents. His father Joaquim Ribeiro da Costa, from Salvador, was a naval engineer, and his mother Alina Ferreira da Costa, was from Manaus. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and at the &quot;Collège National&quot; in Montreux, Switzerland, until 1916, he graduated as an architect in 1924 from the National School of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro. After some early works in the eclectic manner, he adopted Modernism in 1929.

==Career==
In 1930, Costa established a partnership with Russian-born Brazilian architect Gregori Warchavchik, and also became the Director of the National School of Fine Arts where he had studied. Even though he found students eager to be taught in the &quot;new style,&quot; his ruthless administration won him the opposition of the faculty and student body, and Costa eventually had to resign after a year in office. He joined the newly created SPHAN (&quot;Servico do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional&quot; – National Service of Historic and Artistic Heritage) in 1937 under Rodrigo Melo Franco de Andrade. He remained at the National Heritage Service until retirement, acceding to the top post of director, where he was followed by his granddaughter Maria Elisa Costa. During his tenure as regional and then national director, he became involved in numerous controversial decisions (see Controversies).

Costa became a figure associated with reconciling traditional Brazilian forms and construction techniques with international modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier. His works include the Brazilian pavilion at the New York World&#x27;s Fair of 1939 (designed with Oscar Niemeyer), the Parque Guinle residential complex in Rio de Janeiro of 1948, and the Hotel do Park São Clemente in Nova Friburgo of 1948. In the 1950s, Costa was invited to advise on the UNESCO building in Paris and to lecture at the Conference of Venice.

Among his major works are also the Ministry of Education and Health, in Rio (1936–43), designed with Niemeyer, Roberto Burle Marx, among others, and consulted by Le Corbusier, and the Pilot Plan of Brasília, a competition winner designed in 1957 and built mostly in 1958–1960.

Costa taught geometry and drawing at the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios of Rio de Janeiro from 1938–1954. The Liceu was affiliated with the Associação Académica de Coimbra where Costa also taught until 1966, and received a Medal of Merit from the Portuguese government.

==Controversies==
During his long tenure as regional, later national chief of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (&quot;Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional&quot; – IPHAN), Costa pushed for systematic documentation of existing architectural and urbanistic heritage, but his critics allege that he let his personal preferences and political opinions interfere with the bases of his decisions . 

In 1975, he created a public controversy by refusing to sign the landmarking act of the Monroe Palace, the former seat of the Brazilian Congress and later of the Brazilian Senate, built in 1906. The building was slated for demolition due to the construction of the Rio de Janeiro Metro, but in the face of public and media outcry, the construction company shifted the metro line to preserve the building. This effort, however, was in vain, because on October 11, 1975, Brazilian president Ernesto Geisel authorized the building&#x27;s demolition and a developer razed the building in March 1976. The decision was contrary to the State of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s decision declaring the building an Official Landmark in 1974. In 1979, the Cinelândia Station was opened as one of the first five stations of the then-new metro network, on the site of the demolished palace.

Costa preferred the Portuguese colonial architecture of Colonial Brazil over that of any other time or ethnic group (except for Brazilian Modernism). Because of that attitude, inculcated also on younger preservationists thanks to Costa&#x27;s influence in the architecture schools, much of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture, including the architecture of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants, was lost to urban renewal in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1936, when the competition to design the new Ministry of Education and Health was held, the winner was an eclectic design by architect Arquimedes Memória. Costa used his political connections within the government to scrap the competition result and instead form a new design team headed by himself, the Roberto Brothers and a young architect who had been Costa&#x27;s intern, Niemeyer.

==Design of Brasília==

===Summary===

Costa is best known for his urban plan for the city of Brasília, located in Brazil&#x27;s hinterland. Costa won the job in a 1957 public competition in order to replace Rio de Janeiro as the capital of Brazil. His &quot;Plano Piloto&quot; (Pilot Plan) for Brasília, is in the shape of an irregular cross, suggesting an airplane or dragonfly. While the majority of the project&#x27;s architecture was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, Costa&#x27;s own Parque Guinle project was the model for Brasília&#x27;s many residential tower-in-a-park superblocks. The new city was inaugurated on 21 April 1960 and represents one of the largest adoptions of Modernism in a singular project to the present day.

Although named as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, the city is notorious for its windswept emptiness and anti-pedestrian layout. Some streets are badly lit because the height and the spacing of light standards were not changed with the advent of mercury-vapor lamps, and World Heritage Site designation has prevented remediation. Overall, despite the city&#x27;s positive features, the concept and execution have sparked controversy which is explored in &quot;The Modernist City&quot;. Brasília has been expressed as an attempt at a utopian city or in the nickname &quot;ilha da fantasia&quot; (fantasy island), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and the surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization.

===Background and concept===

The middle of the 20th century saw urban struggles for Brazil. Brazilian cities, particularly Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo had seen an increase of problems regarding transportation, sufficient housing, public utilities, and distribution of essential goods such as food. By the 1950s, the frustration of the upper class residents of these locations had convinced the political elite that a long term solution was necessary, making the idea of constructing a new capital city a compelling idea.

There was no consensus on the project from the Brazilian people. Many thought that the new capital would be a &quot;monumental urbanistic and social disaster&quot;, believing that a project of that magnitude and cost would cause massive inflation in the Brazilian economy. The critics believed that the current state of Brazil, defined by poverty, corruption, and disease, would not be addressed by the building of a new capital city; it would merely distract from the nation&#x27;s real issues while giving the populist politicians, such as Juscelino Kubitschek, a way of enriching their personal legacies.

Despite the criticism, the idea of a new capital received widespread backing. To the supporters, Brasília would symbolize Brazil&#x27;s coming of age. The Brazilian coastal cities were remnants of the colonial era and the center for agricultural trade. Despite Brazil&#x27;s imposing geographic presence in South America, the country was largely a coastal country. There had been several publicists calling for a &quot;marcha para oeste&quot;, or westward march, in order to utilize the bountiful excess of land to the west. Also, it was felt that due to the current capital&#x27;s location at Rio, the government&#x27;s views of the nation was distorted. To be placed in a central location for these reasons, Brasília could become a new source for new growth for the country, a springboard for modernization and industrial production.

The new capital would be the diverging point for a series of new infrastructure development, such as long-range highways. It would be an optimistic step towards a unified, modern, and prosperous Brazil; towards fulfilling Brazil&#x27;s &quot;continental destiny&quot; while also relieving the pressure on the existing urban centers. As put by Brazilian writer and diplomat José Osvaldo de Meira Penna in 1958: &quot;A centrally located capital…might make Brazil more conscious of her role in the Americas, her terrestrial frontiers with Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. When the attention of the elites turns from their nearly exclusive interest in Europea, the &#x27;splendid isolation&#x27; will be broken which has until now separated, in spirit and in fact, Brazil from continental neighbors&quot;.

The idea to establish a new Brazilian capital was adopted, and the location for Brasília would be within the Brazilian State of Goiás. The search for the site had been calculated, based on factors such as the favorability of the climate, water supply, land quality for agriculture, a suitable power source within 100 kilometers, and access to ground and air transportation.

===Costa&#x27;s Design===

Once it had been determined that there would be a new capital and the location had been established, the project entered into the design process. The plan was to be selected among competing plans from various Brazilian architects and city planners by an international jury. The participating designers were given the necessary information to make suitable plans for the space. Each participant was to submit two pieces in their proposal, a basic layout of the city and a supporting report that exhibited logistical details.

The design of Lucio Costa was selected for Brasília. Although the design had not been as detailed as some of the other plans submitted, the jurors found it favorable due its features that would complement future population growth. The plan, called Costa&#x27;s &quot;Plano Piloto&quot;, conceptually demanded four components: (1) the government buildings, (2) the residential zones or superblocks, (3) the vehicular circulation and transportation infrastructure, (4) and the city center. In all, this original design was intended to hold a population of 500,000 people. In order to fulfill this, Costa&#x27;s design called for an urban plan in the form of a cross, often described as an airplane, bird, or dragonfly. Some scholars have found symbolism in this shape of plan, a reference to the cross of the early Portuguese conquerors, the bow and arrow of the native populations of Brazil, or the jet shape as a symbol for future innovation.

The plan essentially divided the new capital into two parts, the Monumental Axis and the Residential Axis. The Monumental Axis, which points east to west, would serve as the home for the new civic buildings. This wide mall was intended to create a feeling of grandeur and significance, and is the location of the ministries, national congress, supreme court and other administrative buildings. The two &quot;wings&quot; of the Residential Axis, which runs north to south, would contain the residential and commercial developments. Costa envisioned these as the most important aspect of the design, as they would be home to a majority of the city&#x27;s daily operations, such as local commerce, schools, recreation and churches. The Residential Axis consisted of 96 superblocks, which were limited to six-storey buildings, and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-storey buildings.

Each of the individual super blocks was supposed to have a distinct style for each superblock and a uniform paint scheme that set it apart from the surrounding superblocks. Costa&#x27;s goal for the superblocks was to create neighborhoods and communities that were small self-contained and self-sufficient. He envisioned that they would have apartment buildings of a consistent modern style that housed both upper and middle classes, making integration a key theme of the city&#x27;s design. The Residential Axis&#x27;s two wings were meant to have a character that was intimate and peaceful, rather than the Monumental Axis that was designed to be imposing.

One of the unique aspects about the plan was how it was designed to handle expansion and growth. Unlike most cities, which add to a grid or expand the urban plan with growth, Costa&#x27;s design provided the complete and large-scale plan. The original plan included paving streets in areas of the city that would not be put to immediate use, making the landscape of the city defined and hard to change during future construction. It was already &quot;born with an adult skeleton&quot;. However, this did mean that large portions of the city would not see high levels of activity in the early years. Another contributing factor in the thorough plan was an emphasis on establishing an organized road system that would best serve the expanding use of automobiles. Costa&#x27;s design of auto-routes was meant to create a system where traffic would be free flowing. He hoped that by establishing this grid at the city&#x27;s founding that future construction projects regarding traffic improvements could be avoided.

===Construction and Establishment===

The President of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek (1956-1961), approved Costa&#x27;s plan and construction of Brasília, fulfilling the promise of the Brazilian constitution and some of his own personal political campaign promises. Construction started in 1956, using the urban design of Costa and the services of chief architect Oscar Niemeyer. The building materials for the large project were primarily from local sources. The residential buildings in the superblocks were all constructed with local concrete. The initial phase of Brasília was completed on 21 April 1960, in only four years. By the time of the inauguration on this date, while the city was not fully complete, Costa&#x27;s vision had taken its physical form; the main buildings on the Monumental Axis, such as the Congress and Ministries had been built, along with the main transit center, the majority of the highway system, and several of the superblocks. In order to complete the large project in a short window of time, funding had to be organized swiftly, sufficient labor had to be acquired, and equipment and material had to be bought and transported onto the site.

Labor for the project required the migration of workers into the area and construction camps were built to house workers with the permission of the authorities. These temporary settlements, also called &quot;Cidade Livre&quot;, were eventually slated for removal. However, these efforts were ineffective, and the settlements grew into self-sustaining communities, and were eventually adopted as satellite cities (suburbs). Gradually over the decades to come, the satellite communities continued to form on the outskirts of Brasília, serving a valuable function towards battling low-cost housing issues that arose in the city. While alterations have been made to the design since the city&#x27;s construction, the original plan by Costa prominently survives.

Following the opening of Brasília, the modern design attracted the interest of artists, theater and musical groups, and younger generations of Brazilian citizens. One reason for this particular crowd was a coordinated effort to make Brasília the new cultural center of the country. There were venues during the city&#x27;s first years to help encourage artistic activities, such as the International Congress of Art Critics in 1959, an annual National Salon for several years in the early 1960s, and the establishment of several musical and theatrical groups.

Since its initial completion, Brasília has gone through several stages of population changes. After initial interest following the opening, population numbers decreased before recovering in the late 1960s. Brasília is now estimated to be Brazil&#x27;s 3rd most populous city.

<text>Savaii is the largest and highest island both in Samoa and in the Samoan Islands chain. The island is also the sixth largest in Polynesia, behind the three main islands of New Zealand and the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and Maui. While it is larger than the second main island, Upolu, it is significantly less populated.

Samoans sometimes refer to the island of Savaii as Salafai: This is its classical Samoan name, and is used in formal oratory and prose. The island is home to 43,958 people (2016 census), and they make up 24% of the population of Samoa.
The island&#x27;s only township and ferry terminal is called Salelologa. It is the main point of entry to the island, and is situated at the east end of Savaii. A tar sealed road serves as the single main highway, connecting most of the villages. Local bus routes also operate, reaching most settlements.

Savaii is made up of six &quot;itūmālō&quot; (political districts). Each district is made up of villages that have strong traditional ties with each other — of kinship, history, and land — and that use similar &quot;matai&quot; (titles for their village chiefs). Savaii&#x27;s relatively limited ecotourism operations are organized mostly at the village level. The Mau, Samoa&#x27;s non-violent movement for political independence during colonialism in the early 1900s, had its beginnings on Savaii, with the Mau a Pule movement.

The island is the largest shield volcano in the South Pacific. Its most recent eruptions were in the early 1900s. Its central region comprises the Central Savaii Rainforest, extending over which is the largest contiguous rainforest in Polynesia. It is dotted with more than 100 volcanic craters and contains most of Samoa&#x27;s native species of flora and fauna, making it one of the world&#x27;s most globally significant conservation areas.

==Society and culture==
Faʻa Sāmoa, the unique traditional culture and way of life in Samoan society, remains strong in Savaiʻi, where there are fewer signs of modern life and less development than on the island of Upolu, where the capital, Apia, is located.

Samoan society is communal and based on extended family relationships and socio-cultural obligations, so that kinship and genealogies are important. These faʻa Sāmoa values are also associated with concepts of love (&quot;alofa&quot;), service (&quot;tautua&quot;) to family and community, respect (&quot;faʻaaloalo&quot;) and discipline (&quot;usitaʻi&quot;). Most families are made up of a number of different households situated close to each other.

Like the rest of Samoa, Savaiʻi is made up of villages with most of the land collectively owned by families or &quot;ʻaiga&quot;. Most people on Savaiʻi, 93% of the island population, live on customary land. The heads of the family are called &quot;matai&quot;, the holders of family names and titles. An extended family can have a number of chiefs with different chief titles. Men and women in Samoa have equal rights to chief titles which are bestowed by consensus of the extended family. Traditionally, male and female roles are defined by labours and tasks, chiefly status and age. Women play an important role contributing to family decisions as well as village governance. Elders are revered and respected. Social relationships are dictated by cultural etiquettes of politeness and common greetings.

The Samoan language has a &#x27;polite&#x27; and formal variant used in Samoan oratory and ceremony as well as in communication with elders, guests, people of rank and strangers. In all villages, the majority of people are largely sustained by plantation work and fishing with financial assistance from relatives working in Apia or overseas.
Most people live in coastal villages although there are some settlements inland such as the villages of Aopo, Patamea and Sili.

Behind the villages are cultivated plantations with crops of taro, cocoa &quot;koko&quot;, coconuts &quot;popo&quot;, yams &quot;palai&quot;, &quot;ava&quot;, fruit and vegetables as well other native plants such as pandanus for weaving ʻie tōga fine mats and bark for tapa cloth.

There is a church in every village, mostly Christian denominations. Sunday is sacred and a day of rest as 98% of Samoans identify themselves as religious. White Sunday is one of the most important days of the year in Samoa when children are treated with special attention by their families and community.

==History==
===World War II===
During World War II, Savaii came under the Allies &#x27;Samoa Defense Group&#x27; which included Upolu, Tutuila and Wallis Island and later extended in 1944 to cover bases in other islands such as Bora Bora and the Cook Islands.
A military governor of the Samoa Defense Group was Brigadier General Henry L. Larsen who had secret orders mandating a defensive position of the islands from east to west. The code name for the entire group of islands was &quot;Straw&quot; and the code name for Savaii was &quot;Strawman&quot;. The code for Upolu was &quot;Strawhat&quot;, Tutuila &quot;Strawstack&quot; while Wallis Island was &quot;Strawboard&quot;. A small base was set up on the central north coast village of Fagamalo, which had a wharf and anchorage. Fagamalo was the main village for the colonial administration at the time on Savaii, situated where the small post office is today.

&quot;In its present unprotected state, Western Samoa is a hazard of first magnitude for the defense of American Samoa. The conclusion is inescapable that if we don&#x27;t occupy it the Japanese will and there may not be a great deal of time left.&quot;

—8 February 1943 Report on Western Samoa defence by 2nd Marine Brigade&#x27;s intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel William L. Bales.

On 18 May 1942 the 3rd Marine Brigade with 4,853 officers and men were on Upolu and Savaii under the command of Brigadier General Charles D. Barrett.

===1839 Wilkes Expedition===
In October 1839, Savaii and the Samoa Islands were surveyed by the famous United States Exploring Expedition led by Charles Wilkes. The survey of Savaii was performed by Lieutenant-Commandant Ringgold aboard the U.S. Brig &quot;Porpoise.&quot; Wilkes and other ships in the expedition were surveying Upolu and Tutuila at the same time. The &quot;Porpoise&quot; first touched down at the village of Sapapalii. Some of the team, Dr Pickering and Lieutenant Maury were dropped off while the brig surveyed the island&#x27;s coastline and tides. Dr Pickering and the lieutenant were hosted by the resident missionary at Sapapalii, the Reverend Mr. Hardie. The &quot;Porpoise&quot; examined the bay of Palauli where there was a missionary station under the supervision of a Mr M&#x27;Donald. Wilkes&#x27; report also described Saleaula village, Asau at the west end of the island and &#x27;the beautiful village of Falealupo&#x27; which was under the charge of a Tongan missionary. At the &#x27;north point&#x27; of the island, the brig found &#x27;good anchorage&#x27; in the bay of Matautu (where the village of Fagamalo is situated). The brig was anchored and the harbour surveyed. Wilkes&#x27; wrote that this was the harbour on the island where a vessel could anchor in safety. Here, in Matautu, the explorers noticed a difference with other parts of Savaii.
&quot;A great difference in form, physiognomy and manners...was observed here, as well as a change in the character of many articles of manufacture. The warclubs and spears were of uncommon form, and neatly made.&quot;
On 24 October, Wilkes writes, that the &quot;Porpoise&quot; arrived back at Sapapalii village, having been gone nine days. The team met paramount chief Malietoa and his son at the village. With local guides Dr Pickering had travelled some way into the interior of the island, reaching one side of a volcanic crater about one thousand feet above the sea and some inland.

One 10 November 1839, the Wilkes Expedition weighed anchor at Apia and sailed westward, and on 11 November, had lost sight of Savaii.

===Notable places and people===
* Archaeology in Samoa has uncovered prehistoric settlements inland in many parts of the island including sites at Sapapalii village and Vailoa in Palauli district.
* The exiled orator Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe (died 1915), leader of the Mau a Pule, a resistance group against colonial rule in the early 1900s, was from the traditional sub-district of Safotulafai.
* The missionary John Williams (1796–1839) arrived in the village of Sapapalii in 1830. Sapapalii was also a base for the Malietoa title on Savaii. A plaque by the main road in the village commemorates Williams&#x27; landing.
* In pre-history, the village of Safotu was a settlement for Tongans.
* Olaf Frederick Nelson, another exiled leader of the Mau movement in the 1920s, was born in Safune.
* The Pulemelei Mound in Palauli is the largest and most ancient structure in Polynesia.
* Pio Taofinuu (1923–2006), the first Polynesian cardinal and bishop, was from the village of Falealupo, Savaii.
* Reverend George Pratt (1817–1894), a missionary of the London Missionary Society during the 1800s, lived in Matautu on the north coast. Pratt authored the first Samoan English language dictionary &quot;A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan Vocabulary&quot;, first printed in 1862. Pratt&#x27;s valuable dictionary records many old words of special interest–specialist terminology, archaic words and names in Samoan tradition. It contains sections on Samoan poetry and proverbs, and an extensive grammatical sketch.
*Activist Leilua Lino is from Asau on the island. In 2019 she was presented with a Commonwealth Innovation for Sustainable Development Award by Prince Harry.

==Politics==

With the country&#x27;s independence in 1962, Samoa incorporates both traditional political structures alongside a western parliamentary system. The modern national Government of Samoa, based in the capital Apia with the roles of Prime Minister, Members of Parliament and western styled political structure, is referred to as the Malo. Only Samoans with chief &quot;matai&quot; titles are eligible to become Members of Parliament.

Alongside Samoa&#x27;s national and modern political structure is traditional authority vested in family chiefs (matai). The term Pule is applied to traditional authority in Savaii.

The word Pule refers to appointments or authorities conferred on certain clans or individuals, sometime in the political history of Samoa. This traditional Pule authority was centred in certain villages around Savaii. In the early 20th century, these Pule areas on Savaii island were Safotulafai, Saleaula, Safotu, Asau, Satupaitea and Palauli. Safotu, Asau, Satupaitea and Vailoa (Palauli district) gained &#x27;Pule&#x27; status at different times in the 19th Century, and together with the two older Pule districts, Safotulafai and Saleaula, became the six Pule centres on Savaii.

In 1908, the &#x27;Mau a Pule&#x27; resistance movement to colonial rule, which grew to become the national Mau movement, began on Savaii and represented traditional authority against the German administration of Samoa. The equivalent term &#x27;Tumua&#x27; is associated with traditional authority on Upolu island.

At the local level throughout Samoa, traditional authority is vested in a chiefs&#x27; council (&quot;fono o matai&quot;) in each village. The &quot;fono o matai&quot; carry out &#x27;village law&#x27; and socio-political governance based on their traditional authority and faa Samoa. The authority of the &quot;matai&quot; is balanced against central government, the Malo. Most of the matai are males, however, the women in each village also have a voice in domestic affairs through the women&#x27;s committees.
The main government administration offices of the Malo on Savaii are situated in the village of Tuasivi, 10 minutes north of the ferry terminal and market at Salelologa. There&#x27;s a district hospital, police station, post office and court houses in Tuasivi.

Vaai Kolone, a &quot;matai&quot; and businessman from Vaisala, at the west end of the island, became the Prime Minister of Samoa twice in the 1980s.

Samoa has 11 political districts (itūmālō) and 6 are in Savaii; Faasaleleaga, Gagaemauga, Gagaifomauga, Palauli, Satupaitea and Vaisigano.

==Scenery and landscape==

Savaii is mountainous, fertile and surrounded by coral reefs. Lonely Planet describes the Savaii landscape as &#x27;spectacular tropical terrain&#x27;. The island has a gently sloping profile, reaching a maximum altitude of 1,858 metres at Mt Silisili, the highest peak in the country and the Samoa Islands chain. Volcanic craters in the highlands are strung across the central ridges from Tuasivi (literally, &quot;backbone&quot;) village in the east towards Cape Mulinuu to the west. The lava fields at Saleaula village on the central north coast are the result of volcanic eruptions from Mt Matavanu (1905–1911). Most of the coastline are palm fringed beaches and there are rainforests, waterfalls, caves, freshwater pools, blowholes and coral reefs. There are also numerous archaeological sites, including star mounds, fortifications and pyramids such as the Pulemelei Mound in Palauli district. Archaeology in Samoa has uncovered many pre-historic settlements including sites at Vailoa and Sapapalii.

==Myths and legends==

Rich in Polynesian history and oral tradition, Savaii is mentioned in myths and legends across the Pacific Islands and has been called the &quot;Cradle of Polynesia.&quot;

The name of the island comes from the myth of the brother and sister Sava and I&#x27;i.

Samoan mythology tells stories of different gods. There were gods of the forest, the seas, rain, harvest, villages, and war. There were two types of gods: &quot;atua&quot;, who had non-human origins, and &quot;aitu&quot;, who were of human origin. Tagaloa was a supreme god who made the islands and the people. Mafuie was the god of earthquakes. There were also a number of war gods. Nafanua, Samoa&#x27;s warrior goddess, hails from the village of Falealupo at the west end of the island, which is also the site of the entry into Pulotu, the spirit world. Nafanua&#x27;s father Saveasiuleo was the god of Pulotu. Another well-known legend tells of two sisters, Tilafaiga and Taema, bringing the art of tattooing to Samoa from Fiti. Tilafaiga is the mother of Nafanua. The freshwater pool Mata o le Alelo &#x27;Eyes of the Demon&#x27; from the Polynesian legend Sina and the Eel is situated in the village of Matavai on the north coast in the village district of Safune. Another figure of legend is Tui Fiti, who resides at Fagamalo village in the village district of Matautu on the central north coast. The village of Falelima is associated with a dreaded spirit deity called Nifoloa.

Savaii is known as the &quot;Soul of Samoa.&quot; &quot;Here the 20th century has put down the shallowest roots, and the &quot;faa Samoa&quot;—the Samoan way—has the most meaning.&quot;

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===

The tropical climate and fertile soil results in a variety of flora. Vegetation types include littoral, wetland and volcanic vegetation. Rainforests include coastal, lowland and montane forests (above 500m elevation). Cloud forests are located in the highest elevations of the island which are often under cloud cover with wet conditions.
At Mt Silisili, cloud forest occurs above 1200 m elevation. The Savaii forest is dominated by a 15 to 20 m high canopy of &quot;Dysoxylum huntii&quot;, &quot;Omalanthus acuminatus&quot;, &quot;Reynoldsia pleiosperma&quot; and &quot;Pterophylla samoensis&quot;. Other common trees include &quot;Coprosma savaiiense&quot;, &quot;Psychotria xanthochlora&quot;, &quot;Spiraeanthemum samoense&quot; and &quot;Streblus anthropophagorum&quot;. There are nearly 500 species of flowering plants and about 200 species of ferns in Samoa, making it richer than that of any tropical Polynesian island other than those in the Hawaiian archipelago. About 25% of the species are endemic to Samoa.

The variety of tropical plant life is also a material source for floral adornment, tapa cloth, ie toga, perfumes, coconut oil as well as herbs and plants for traditional medicines. Common plants with everyday usage include the smooth reddish purple leaves of the &quot;ti&quot; (&quot;Dracaena terminalis&quot;) plant used with coconut oil for traditional massage, &quot;fofo&quot;, and the dried root stems of &quot;Piper methysticum&quot; (Latin &quot;pepper&quot; and Latinized Greek &quot;intoxicating&quot;) are mixed with water for the important &quot;ʻava ceremony&quot; conducted during cultural events and gatherings.

===Fauna===

Animal species include fruit bats such as the Samoa flying-fox (&quot;Pteropus samoensis&quot;), land and seabirds, skinks and geckos. The birdlife of Samoa includes a total of 82 species, of which 11 are endemic, found only in Samoa. Endemic birdlife found only on Savaii include species such as the Samoan white-eye (&quot;Zosterops samoensis&quot;) which is only found in the high cloud forests and alpine scrub around Mt Silisili, and Samoan moorhen (&quot;Gallinula pacifica&quot;), which was last recorded in 1873 near Aopo with possible sightings in 1984 and 2003. The tooth-billed pigeon, (&quot;Didunculus strigirostris&quot;), also known as &quot;the manumea&quot; is also endemic and now increasingly rare, leading to the current proposition to upgrade it to critically endangered. It is the national bird of Samoa and is found on some of the local currency. It is likely that the extensive loss of lowland forest, hunting and invasive species are responsible for the decline of this stunning species.

Samoa has more native species of ferns and butterflies than New Zealand, a country 85 times larger. In 2006, research samples of the blue moon butterfly species (&quot;Hypolimnas bolina&quot;) on Savaii found that males accounted for just 1% of the population and had almost been wiped out by an invasive species. Sampling a year later showed a dramatic comeback and recovery to 40%.

The surrounding Pacific Ocean, coral reefs and lagoons are rich in marine life and some are harvested as an important source of food in an economy that is mainly subsistence with locals reliant on the land and the ocean for survival. Dolphins, whales and porpoises migrate through Samoa&#x27;s waters.
The &quot;Palolo&quot; reef worm (&quot;Eunice viridis&quot;) is a Samoan cuisine delicacy which appear in the ocean only one day of the year. Palolo has cultural significance and entire villages flock to the sea for harvest.

Surrounded by a variety of tropical fauna, Samoan mythology is rich with stories of animals incorporated into their culture, traditional beliefs and way of life.

===Conservation===
The island is rich in biodiversity and endemic native species which are also highly threatened. The Central Savaii Rainforest comprising 72,699 hectares is the largest continuous patch of rainforest in Polynesia and contains most of Samoa&#x27;s native species. Seventy percent of Samoa&#x27;s settlements are by the coast with increasing threat from climate change and sea level rising. As most of the land in Samoa is under customary ownership, conservation projects are developed with the approval and cooperation of villages. The Government of Samoa supports conservation covenants for three natural areas on Savaii, the Falealupo Rainforest Preserve, Tafua Rainforest Preserve and Aopo Cloud Forest Reserve. The conservation projects are a partnership between the local &quot;matai&quot; and villages, government, conservation organisations and international funding such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These support community based projects in villages, many of which are developed with international support and micro financing in areas of sustainable livelihoods, land management and conservation on both land and in coastal marine areas. There are wetlands in the village of Satoalepai on the central north coast where large sea green turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) are kept by the locals as an eco-tourism experience for visitors and provide extra income for communities. Another turtle habitat is at the village of Auala on the north west coast.

==Travel information==
===Ferry terminal===
Salelologa is the main port and township, situated at the east end of the island where the inter-island ferry terminal is located. A regular passenger and vehicle ferry operates seven days a week in the Apolima Strait between Salelologa and Mulifanua wharf on Upolu. The ferry crossing takes about 90-minutes with views of Apolima and Manono islands to the south. The ferries operate only during the day. Local buses and taxis are available at the terminal and township. There&#x27;s also a wharf at Asau at the north west end of the island, sometimes used for yachting.

===Driving===
Savaii has an excellent tar-seal road circling the island. A leisurely drive around the island takes under 3 hours. The scenic drive is mostly along the coastline where most of the locals live in villages. Driving in Samoa is on the left side of the road, effective from 7 September 2009 when the government changed the law to bring motoring in line with neighbouring countries. Samoa is the first country in the 21st century to switch to driving on the left.

===Airport===

Maota Airport is a small airstrip with basic facilities situated 10-minutes south of Salelologa ferry terminal and township. Flights operate between Maota and Asau airstrip and Faleolo International Airport on Upolu. The inter-island flights take about 30-minutes. Asau Airport is an airstrip at the north west end of the island which mainly services chartered flights.

===Amenities===
A local market (open Monday – Saturday) at Salelologa sells fresh produce of fruit, vegetables and local crafts. There are also clothing stores, several small supermarkets, a wholesaler, petrol stations, bakeries, budget hotels and accommodation, buses, taxis, rental car companies as well as public amenities such as internet access, banks and Western Union money transfer outlets. There are small local shops in every village around Savaii, selling basic groceries. Markets and most shops in Samoa close on Sundays with smaller outlets opening late afternoon after church services.

===Hospitals===
The main hospital on Savaii is the Malietoa Tanumafili II Hospital, situated in Tuasivi village. Another district hospital is in Safotu, on the central north coast.

==Tourism==

===Cultural context===
With most of the land in Samoa under customary ownership with local governance by &quot;matai&quot;, tourism experiences take place on village land and within local culture. There are hotels, but like the rest of Samoa, many villages provide beach fale accommodation for visitors all around the island such as Manase on the central north coast. These are small local businesses run by families within their villages and most of the income goes directly back to the community.
There are island tours, diving, fishing, plantation trips, treks and other tourism related activities. Most shops are closed on Sundays with a few re-opening after church services in late afternoon. Every day, evening prayer (&quot;sa&quot;) takes place in every village around dusk before the evening meal and lasts about half an hour. It is usually signalled by the sound of a conch shell or the ringing of the church bell. The &quot;sa&quot; usually means no loud noise or walking through the village commons. &quot;Matai&quot; sometimes stand by the side of the main road, which pass through village land, to slow down traffic until prayers are over. Tourism is overseen by the government Samoa Visitors&#x27; Bureau, situated in the capital Apia, which can also help to settle disputes. At the village level, much of the country&#x27;s civil and criminal matters can be dealt with directly by the &quot;matai&quot; chief village councils.

===The last sunset in the world===
The village of Falealupo on the westernmost point of Savaii, is just from the dateline. It was arguably the last place in the world to see the sunset until a time zone change at end of 2011. Falealupo was the site of Millennium 2000 celebrations and reported by the BBC as &#x27;the last place on earth to enter the new millennium.&#x27; Falealupo also has protected rainforests.

===Surfing===
Savaii has surfing off reef breaks all around the island, with more waves during summer on the north coast and the south coast in winter. The conditions are not for novice surfers and there can be dangerous undercurrents and rips. Satuiatua on the south-west coast attracts surfers. Other surfing spots around Savaii include breaks off the villages of Lano, Aganoa Beach by Tafua, Lefagaoalii, Lelepa and Fagamalo.

===Tourism development===
In 2008, an American company South Pacific Development Group (SPDG) obtained a 120-year lease for of prime oceanfront customary land in Sasina, to build a luxury resort estimated to cost $450 – US$500 million. The developers pay less than one penny per square foot of land per month. The development will include a casino, timeshares and a cultural centre. The company is expecting to receive the casino licence for Savaii island in a new law legalising casinos proposed by the government, the &quot;Casino and Gambling Bill 2010&quot; tabled to parliament by the prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi in March 2010.

The announcement of the tourist development raised concern among environmental group O Le Siosiomaga Society about the impact of the development. The Samoa Hotel Association also expressed concern at the size of the development and its impact on the island&#x27;s environment and infrastructure. The development is supported by the Government of Samoa. The lease is unprecedented in Samoa where 80% of the land is under customary ownership, 6% freehold and the rest owned by the government.

==Film==

&quot;Moana&quot; (1926), one of the earliest documentaries made in the world, was filmed in Safune on the central north coast. The film was directed by Robert J. Flaherty who lived with his wife and children in Safune for more than a year. A cave with a pool in Safune was converted into a film processing laboratory and two young men from the village were trained to work there. Flaherty cast people from Safune in the film including local boy Taavale who played the lead role of &#x27;Moana&#x27;. Another boy called Pea played the role of Moana&#x27;s younger brother. Pea later became a chief with the title Taulealeausumai from the village of Faletagaloa. Playing the lead female role in the film was Faagase, a girl from Lefagaoalii. The film also showed the young hero &#x27;Moana&#x27; receiving a pea, a traditional Samoan tattoo.

==Geography==
Savaii island lies north west of Upolu. These two largest islands of Samoa are separated by the Apolima Strait which is about wide with the small inhabited islands of Manono and Apolima between them.
Savaii island is of volcanic origin and the mountainous interiors are covered with dense rain forests. The surrounding landscape consists of fertile plateaux and coastal plains with numerous rivers and streams.

===Climate===

The climate is oceanic tropical with high temperatures and humidity. The heaviest rainfall occurs between the months of November and April, and cyclones, which are relatively frequent, are most likely to occur during these same months. Two cyclones, Cyclone Ofa (1990) and Cyclone Valerie (1991) caused extensive damage on the north and west coast of Savaii.

==Geology==
Savaii is the largest shield volcano in the South Pacific and only 3% is above water.
It is an active volcano, which last erupted in 1905–1911 with lava flows that destroyed villages on the central north coast. The island is formed by a massive basaltic shield volcano which rises from the seafloor of the western Pacific Ocean. A possible model for the formation of the volcanic Samoa island chain is explained by the Samoa hotspot situated at the east end of the Samoa Islands. In theory, the Samoa hotspot is a result of the Pacific Tectonic Plate moving over a &#x27;fixed&#x27; deep and narrow mantle plume spewing up through the Earth&#x27;s crust. The Samoa islands generally lie in a straight line, east to west, in the same direction the Plate is moving. In the classic hotspot model, primarily based on studies of the Hawaii hotspot, the volcanic islands and seamounts further away from the Samoa hotspot should be progressively older. However, Savaii, the most western of the Samoa island chain, and Tau Island, the most eastern of the Samoa islands, both erupted in the 20th century, data which is an enigma for scientists. Tau last erupted in 1866. Another discrepancy in the data from the Samoa islands is that subaerial rock samples from Savaii were too young by several million years to fit the classic hotspot model of age progression in an island chain, raising arguments among scientists that the Samoa islands does not have a plume origin. The nearness of Savaii and the Samoa island chain to the Tonga Trench at the south became a possible explanation for these discrepancies as well as the possibility that the islands were formed by magma seeping through cracks in stressed fracture zones. However, in 2005, an international team gathered further submarine samples from the deep flanks and rifts of Savaii. Tests on these later samples showed much older ages, about five million years old, that fit the hotspot model. The discovery in 1975 of Vailuluu Seamount 45 km east of Tau in American Samoa has since been studied by an international team of scientists and contribute towards understanding of the Earth&#x27;s fundamental processes.

Prehistoric geological formations on Savaii have created natural sites such as the Alofaaga Blowholes and Moso&#x27;s Footprint. The Peapea Cave, named after the swallows that inhabit it, is a lava tube one kilometre in length, formed during the Mt Matavanu eruptions.

===Volcanic activity===
The island consists of a large shield volcano similar in form to the Hawaiian volcanoes. Savaii remains volcanically active, with recent eruptions from Matavanu between 1905 and 1911. The Matavanu eruptions flowed towards the central north coast and destroyed villages including Saleaula. Other recent volcanic eruptions include Mata o le Afi in 1902 and Mauga Afi in 1725. The lava field at Saleaula are extensive enough to be visible in high altitude photographs.

==Education==
===Samoa education system===
Like the rest of the country, the education system on Savaii is mostly public education covering primary and secondary schooling in villages. Education in Samoa is compulsory for children aged 5-years to 14-years or until the completion of Year 8.
* Primary education – Year 1 – 8 (8-years)
* Secondary education – Year 9 – 13 (5-years)
Entrance to secondary education is determined by a National Examinination at Year 8. Top achievers in government schools can enter Samoa College on Upolu island with the next group offered places at Vaipouli College in Gagaemauga district on the island&#x27;s central north coast. The rest attend the nearest secondary school in their district. With most of the land in the country under customary ownership in village settlements, schooling and education is a joint responsibility between the government and villages, governed at the local level by &quot;matai&quot;.

===Cost===
====Village responsibility====
In both primary and secondary schools across Samoa, villages are responsible for school buildings, equipment, furniture, fundraising and collection of school fees. With most of the population living off their land in a mostly traditional way of life with little paid employment available, villages such as Falealupo were forced to sell logging rights to their native forests in 1990, to pay for their school buildings, following threat of closure from the government. An American ethnobotanist, Paul Cox, who had lived in the village with his family, raised funds internationally to save the school and create a conservation covenant with &quot;matai&quot; to protect their native forest.

====Government responsibility====
The government is responsible for teachers, curriculum and educational materials as well as assessments and exams administered under the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture. The government also employs School Review Officers who are the main liaison with schools.

===International aid===
The government receives international aid for education from countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Japan through their foreign aid programmes. In 2006, a bilateral partnership between Ausaid (Australia) and NZAID (New Zealand) with the Asia Development Bank launched an education sector program (ESPII) focusing on primary and secondary education over a number of years. The contribution from AUSaid is up to $14 million dollars with NZAID committing NZ$12.5 million over five years. Australia is also contributing $2 million towards a School Fee Grant Scheme to 163 primary schools during 2009–2010. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) also constributes significant aid towards education.

===Tertiary education===
Most opportunities for tertiary education in the country are available on Upolu island, the location of the National University of Samoa and the Alafua Campus of the regional University of the South Pacific.
International volunteer programmes including the American Peace Corps also provide teachers throughout schools in Savaii and the rest of the country.

===School calendar===

===List of schools in Savaii===

There are 9 secondary schools and 48 primary schools on the island.

===Public library===
Savaii Public Library is the only public library on the island. It is situated by the old market in the township of Salelologa at the east end of Savaii. The library is a branch of the central Samoa Public Library in the capital Apia on Upolu island.

==Public holidays==
Public holidays;

Samoa gained political independence from New Zealand on 1 January 1962. However, independence celebrations take place on 1 June, each year.

<text>Ceraunus (Céran) was the Bishop of Paris from 606 to about 614. 

==Life==
Ceraunus was bishop of Paris. He established a school at the monastery of Saint-Vincent - on the site of the later monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. 

In 614 he took part in the Council of Paris, which was held in the Apostolic Church of Saintes-Pierre-et-Paul - on the site of the later monastery of Sainte-Geneviève and today&#x27;s Lycée Henri-IV -and was attended by 78 Frankish bishops. From these bishops he collected and compiled the Acts of the Martyrs. A copy of the acts of Speusippus, Eleusippus and Melapsippus was sent from Langres by one Varnahair, to Ceraunus.

Ceraunus was buried in the crypt of the then Church of the Apostles next to Genoveva of Paris. In 1253 his relics were placed there on an altar in the upper church.

He is a Catholic and Orthodox saint, his feast day is 27 September.

There is a statue of Saint Céran by Louis Desprez in Eglise Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois in Paris.

<text>In mathematics, computer science and network science, network theory is a part of graph theory. It defines networks as graphs where the vertices or edges possess attributes. Network theory analyses these networks over the symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between their (discrete) components.

Network theory has applications in many disciplines, including statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical engineering, biology, archaeology, linguistics, economics, finance, operations research, climatology, ecology, public health, sociology, psychology, and neuroscience.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-021-81767-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks, epistemological networks, etc.; see List of network theory topics for more examples.

Euler&#x27;s solution of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem is considered to be the first true proof in the theory of networks.

== Network optimization ==
Network problems that involve finding an optimal way of doing something are studied as combinatorial optimization. Examples include network flow, shortest path problem, transport problem, transshipment problem, location problem, matching problem, assignment problem, packing problem, routing problem, critical path analysis, and program evaluation and review technique.

== Network analysis ==

=== Electric network analysis ===
The analysis of electric power systems could be conducted using network theory from two main points of view:
# An abstract perspective (i.e., as a graph consists from nodes and edges), regardless of the electric power aspects (e.g., transmission line impedances). Most of these studies focus only on the abstract structure of the power grid using node degree distribution and betweenness distribution, which introduces substantial insight regarding the vulnerability assessment of the grid. Through these types of studies, the category of the grid structure could be identified from the complex network perspective (e.g., single-scale, scale-free). This classification might help the electric power system engineers in the planning stage or while upgrading the infrastructure (e.g., add a new transmission line) to maintain a proper redundancy level in the transmission system.
# Weighted graphs that blend an abstract understanding of complex network theories and electric power systems properties.

===Social network analysis===
Social network analysis examines the structure of relationships between social entities. These entities are often persons, but may also be groups, organizations, nation states, web sites, or scholarly publications.

Since the 1970s, the empirical study of networks has played a central role in social science, and many of the mathematical and statistical tools used for studying networks have been first developed in sociology. Amongst many other applications, social network analysis has been used to understand the diffusion of innovations, news and rumors. Similarly, it has been used to examine the spread of both diseases and health-related behaviors. It has also been applied to the study of markets, where it has been used to examine the role of trust in exchange relationships and of social mechanisms in setting prices. It has been used to study recruitment into political movements, armed groups, and other social organizations. It has also been used to conceptualize scientific disagreements as well as academic prestige. More recently, network analysis (and its close cousin traffic analysis) has gained a significant use in military intelligence, for uncovering insurgent networks of both hierarchical and leaderless nature.

===Biological network analysis===

With the recent explosion of publicly available high throughput biological data, the analysis of molecular networks has gained significant interest. The type of analysis in this context is closely related to social network analysis, but often focusing on local patterns in the network. For example, network motifs are small subgraphs that are over-represented in the network. Similarly, activity motifs are patterns in the attributes of nodes and edges in the network that are over-represented given the network structure. Using networks to analyze patterns in biological systems, such as food-webs, allows us to visualize the nature and strength of interactions between species. The analysis of biological networks with respect to diseases has led to the development of the field of network medicine. Recent examples of application of network theory in biology include applications to understanding the cell cycle as well as a quantitative framework for developmental processes.

=== Narrative network analysis ===

The automatic parsing of &quot;textual corpora&quot; has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale. The resulting narrative networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by Quantitative Narrative Analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.

===Link analysis===
Link analysis is a subset of network analysis, exploring associations between objects. An example may be examining the addresses of suspects and victims, the telephone numbers they have dialed, and financial transactions that they have partaken in during a given timeframe, and the familial relationships between these subjects as a part of police investigation. Link analysis here provides the crucial relationships and associations between very many objects of different types that are not apparent from isolated pieces of information. Computer-assisted or fully automatic computer-based link analysis is increasingly employed by banks and insurance agencies in fraud detection, by telecommunication operators in telecommunication network analysis, by medical sector in epidemiology and pharmacology, in law enforcement investigations, by search engines for relevance rating (and conversely by the spammers for spamdexing and by business owners for search engine optimization), and everywhere else where relationships between many objects have to be analyzed. Links are also derived from similarity of time behavior in both nodes. Examples include climate networks where the links between two locations (nodes) are determined, for example, by the similarity of the rainfall or temperature fluctuations in both sites.

====Web link analysis====
Several Web search ranking algorithms use link-based centrality metrics, including Google&#x27;s PageRank, Kleinberg&#x27;s HITS algorithm, the CheiRank and TrustRank algorithms. Link analysis is also conducted in information science and communication science in order to understand and extract information from the structure of collections of web pages. For example, the analysis might be of the interlinking between politicians&#x27; websites or blogs. Another use is for classifying pages according to their mention in other pages.

===Centrality measures===
Information about the relative importance of nodes and edges in a graph can be obtained through centrality measures, widely used in disciplines like sociology. For example, eigenvector centrality uses the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix corresponding to a network, to determine nodes that tend to be frequently visited. Formally established measures of centrality are degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, subgraph centrality, and Katz centrality. The purpose or objective of analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure to be used. For example, if one is interested in dynamics on networks or the robustness of a network to node/link removal, often the dynamical importance of a node is the most relevant centrality measure.

===Assortative and disassortative mixing===

These concepts are used to characterize the linking preferences of hubs in a network. Hubs are nodes which have a large number of links. Some hubs tend to link to other hubs while others avoid connecting to hubs and prefer to connect to nodes with low connectivity. We say a hub is assortative when it tends to connect to other hubs. A disassortative hub avoids connecting to other hubs. If hubs have connections with the expected random probabilities, they are said to be neutral. There are three methods to quantify degree correlations.

===Recurrence networks===
The recurrence matrix of a recurrence plot can be considered as the adjacency matrix of an undirected and unweighted network. This allows for the analysis of time series by network measures. Applications range from detection of regime changes over characterizing dynamics to synchronization analysis.

== Spatial networks ==
Many real networks are embedded in space. Examples include, transportation and other infrastructure networks, brain neural networks. Several models for spatial networks have been developed.

== Temporal networks ==

Other networks emphasise the evolution over time of systems of nodes and their interconnections. Temporal networks are used for example to study how financial risk has spread across countries. In this study, temporal networks are used to also visually trace the intricate dynamics of financial contagion during crises. Unlike traditional network approaches that aggregate or analyze static snapshots, the study uses a time-respecting path methodology to preserve the sequence and timing of financial crises contagion events. This enables the identification of nodes as sources, transmitters, or receivers of financial stress, avoiding mischaracterizations inherent in static or aggregated methods. Following this approach, banks are found to serve as key intermediaries in contagion paths, and temporal analysis pinpoints smaller countries like Greece and Italy as significant origins of shocks during crises—insights obscured by static approaches that overemphasize large economies like the US or Japan.

Temporal networks can also be used to explore how cooperation evolves in dynamic, real-world population structures where interactions are time-dependent. Here the authors find that network temporality enhances cooperation compared to static networks, even though &quot;bursty&quot; interaction patterns typically hinder it. This finding also shows how cooperation and other emergent behaviours can thrive in realistic, time-varying population structures, challenging conventional assumptions rooted in static models.

In psychology, temporal networks enable the understanding of psychological disorders by framing them as dynamic systems of interconnected symptoms rather than outcomes of a single underlying cause. Using &quot;nodes&quot; to represent symptoms and &quot;edges&quot; to signify their direct interactions, symptoms like insomnia and fatigue are shown how they influence each other over time; also, disorders such as depression are shown not to be fixed entities but evolving networks, where identifying &quot;bridge symptoms&quot; like concentration difficulties can explain comorbidity between conditions such as depression and anxiety.

Lastly, temporal networks enable a better understanding and controlling of the spread of infectious diseases. Unlike traditional static networks, which assume continuous, unchanging connections, temporal networks account for the precise timing and duration of interactions between individuals. This dynamic approach reveals critical nuances, such as how diseases can spread via time-sensitive pathways that static models miss. Temporal data, such as interactions captured through Bluetooth sensors or in hospital wards, can improve predictions of outbreak speed and extent. Overlooking temporal correlations can lead to significant errors in estimating epidemic dynamics, emphasizing the need for a temporal framework to develop more accurate strategies for disease control.

== Spread ==
Content in a complex network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread. In conserved spread, the total amount of content that enters a complex network remains constant as it passes through. The model of conserved spread can best be represented by a pitcher containing a fixed amount of water being poured into a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the pitcher represents the original source and the water is the content being spread. The funnels and connecting tubing represent the nodes and the connections between nodes, respectively. As the water passes from one funnel into another, the water disappears instantly from the funnel that was previously exposed to the water. In non-conserved spread, the amount of content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network. The model of non-conserved spread can best be represented by a continuously running faucet running through a series of funnels connected by tubes. Here, the amount of water from the original source is infinite. Also, any funnels that have been exposed to the water continue to experience the water even as it passes into successive funnels. The non-conserved model is the most suitable for explaining the transmission of most infectious diseases, neural excitation, information and rumors, etc.

===Network immunization===
The question of how to immunize efficiently scale free networks which represent realistic networks such as the Internet and social networks has been studied extensively. One such strategy is to immunize the largest degree nodes, i.e., targeted (intentional) attacks since for this case formula_1 is relatively high and fewer nodes are needed to be immunized. 
However, in most realistic networks the global structure is not available and the largest degree nodes are unknown.

<text>Sofiia Mykhailivna Yevdokymenko-Rotaru (; ; ; born 7 August 1947), known simply as Sofia Rotaru, is a Ukrainian pop singer of Romanian origin. 

Rotaru, nicknamed &quot;Bukovinsky Solovey&quot; (&quot;the Nightingale from Bukovina&quot;), emerged in 1966 as a pop folk star in the movie &quot;Solovei iz sela Marshyntsi&quot; (Nightingale from Marshyntsi) in the Romanian and Moldovian-speaking world after her manager and future husband Anatoliy Yevdokymenko made her change her music style from folk to pop music with Chervona Ruta.

In 1972, she released the multilingual album &quot;Sofia Rotaru&quot;, re-released three times and covered by numerous singers, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in the countries of the former Soviet Union. She first gained international recognition after participating in 1968 in the International Youth Song Festival in Bulgaria and winning first prize at the Golden Orpheus in 1973 and second prize in the category of Polish songs at the Sopot International Song Festival in 1974. In the former USSR her career was marked by her stage success and numerous controversies. She has been acknowledged by the Kyiv Patriarchate.

Rotaru has been performing for more than 40 years, and topped the Moscow airplay with &quot;Ya nazovu planetu imenem tvoim&quot; in 2008.

She reported the highest income of all celebrities in Ukraine in 2008 and 2010.

Her repertoire consists of more than 40 albums and 400 songs recorded in many languages. She has received awards, deemed a Meritorious Artist of the Ukrainian SSR, People&#x27;s Artist of Ukraine, People&#x27;s Artist of Moldavian SSR, Laureate of the Young Communist League Prize, Hero of Moldova, and Cavalier of the Republican Order of Moldova. In August 2002 former President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and President of Russia Vladimir Putin gave awards to Sofia Rotaru for her 55th birthday, bestowing upon her the high rank of the Hero of Ukraine for her &quot;outstanding personal merits in the sphere of art&quot;, and the Russian order &quot;For merits before the Nation&quot;, respectively.

Rotaru&#x27;s official surname is &quot;Yevdokymenko-Rotaru&quot; (). Yevdokymenko was the surname of her late husband. Yalta is her main residence, although she also has homes in Moscow, Kyiv, and Baden-Baden.

==Early life==
Sofia Rotaru, who comes from the Romanian minority in Ukraine, was born in Marshyntsi (&quot;Marșenița&quot;), Chernivtsi Oblast to a family of brigadiers and wine-growers. Marshyntsi is a village of Novoselytskyi Raion (&quot;Noua Suliță&quot;), close to the border with Moldova, and the majority of its population is Romanophone (Romanian-speaking). She was the second child in a family of six children. Her siblings are Zina, Lidia, Aurica, Eugen and Anatol. A passport office employee misreported her birthdate on her passport as 9 August; as a result, Rotaru reportedly celebrates her birthday twice.

Her father, Mykhail Fedorovich Rotaru, spent World War II as a heavy machine gunner and traveled to Berlin. Injured, he returned home only in 1946, and was the first person to join the Communist Party in the village. Her older sister, Zinaida (&quot;Zina&quot;), was born on 11 October 1942. Zina endured severe childhood illness and went blind, but possessed perfect pitch and easily memorized new songs, so she taught Sofia folk songs. Sofia said of her elder sister: &quot;We all learned from her – what a musical memory, what a soul!&quot;. Zina spent hours listening to the radio and learned numerous songs, as well as the Russian language, which she later taught to her brothers and sisters. At home, the Rotaru family spoke only Romanian. As a child, Sofia participated in regional competitions of pentathlon and running.

She started singing from the first grade in the school choir, as well as in the church choir. However, the latter was not acceptable to the school officials. Hence, she was threatened with an exclusion from the Young Pioneer organization. Rotaru was attracted by the theatre. She practiced in drama classes and sang popular folk songs in vocal classes. In the evenings, she used to take the only bayan at school and hide in the barn trying to find the proper melodies for her most loved Moldavian songs. Rotaru said:

==Career==
===1962–1964: Career start and Ukrainian pop-folk===
Rotaru&#x27;s victory at a vocal competition of amateur performers opened the door to a regional review in 1962. In 1963 in Chernivtsi, she earned a first degree diploma at the regional amateur art review. In 1964, she won the all-republic festival of popular talents in Kyiv. On this occasion her picture made it on the cover of No. 27 of the magazine &quot;Ukraine&quot; in 1965. After graduation from high school, Rotaru decided to become a singer and entered the vocal and conductor department of the Chernivtsi Musical College. In addition, she took lessons at Chernivtsi Philharmonic from the famed singer and actress Sidi Tal. In 1964, Rotaru performed at the State Kremlin Palace. The first pop song she performed was &quot;Mama&quot; by Alexander Bronevitskiy.

===1968–1973: International recognition===
In 1968, after graduation from college, Rotaru performed as a delegate of the IX World Festival of Youth and Students in the capital of Bulgaria, as a member of an artistic group. She won First Prize in the competition of singers of folk popular songs. Bulgarian newspapers were full of headlines: &quot;21-year old Sofia has conquered Sofia&quot;. Her performances of the Ukrainian folk pop song &quot;Na kameni stoyu&quot; (Standing on the Stone), Moldavian folk pop songs and &quot;Valentina&quot; by Gheorghite made headlines. The latter song was dedicated to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, who was present in the concert hall. In 1968, Rotaru married Anatoliy Yevdokymenko, who at that time was a student at Chernivtsi University and a trumpet player in a student pop band.

In 1971, producer Roman Alekseev shot a musical film &quot;Chervona Ruta&quot; for Ukrtelefilm. The plot was about the tender and pure love of a girl from the mountains (played by Rotaru) and her relationship with a man from the industrial city of Donetsk. The name of the film means rue, a flower derived from an ancient Carpathian legend. Rue blossoms only on Ivan Kupala Night and the girl who succeeds in finding a blooming rue will be happy in love. Songs of the composer Volodymyr Ivasyuk and other writers were co-performed by Zinkevich, Yaremchuk and other singers. The film enjoyed significant success. After the film was released, Rotaru received an offer to work in the Chernivtsi Philharmonic Society and with a backing ensemble called Chervona Ruta. Anatoliy Yevdokymenko, Rotaru&#x27;s husband, became the artistic director of the ensemble.

As a result of collaborating with Volodymyr Ivasyuk, a cycle of songs was written based on the roots revival material in an orchestration characteristic of the 1960s and the 1970s in Continental Europe. Resulting works brought Rotaru great popularity in the Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine. This was largely due to the fact that the Soviet authorities eagerly promoted her art as an example of international Soviet culture, as she was an ethnic Moldavian/Romanian singing in Moldavian/Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian languages. Consequently, Rotaru gained regular airplay on state radio and television and was systematically billed for state-organized concerts.

In 1972, Rotaru and Chervona Ruta participated in a tour in Poland with the programme &quot;Pesni i tantsy Strany Sovetov&quot; (Songs and Dances of the Country of Soviets).

In the same year Sofia Rotaru collaborated with Don Backy, performing the Ukrainian version of his hit from the 60s L&#x27;immensità - &quot;Syzokrylyi ptakh&quot;.

In 1973, she received First Prize at the international contest of Golden Orpheus in Burgas, Bulgaria, performing the song &quot;Moy gorod&quot; (&quot;My city&quot;) and Second Prize in the category of foreign performance of a song in the Bulgarian language. In 1973, she also was awarded the Meritorious Artist of the Ukrainian SSR. Later, the songs which she performed in the Moldavian/Romanian language, &quot;Codru&quot; and &quot;Moy gorod&quot;, became soundtracks for the film &quot;Vesenniye sozvuchiya – 73&quot;.

===1974–1979: New authors and Moldavian lyricism===
In 1974, Rotaru graduated from the Chişinău Art Institute of Gavriil Musicescu in the choral conducting class with professor Lydia Axionova and participated in the Sopot International Song Festival in Poland, performing &quot;Vospominaniye&quot; (&quot;Remembrance&quot;) by B. Rychkov, and &quot;Vodohrai&quot; by Ivasjuk. She received second prize in the category of &quot;Polish song&quot; for her performance of &quot;Ktoś&quot; (&quot;Someone&quot;). In 1976, she moved from Chernivtsi to Yalta, transferring from the Chernivtsi Philharmonic Society to the Crimean Philharmonic Society. After the death of Volodymyr Ivasyuk in 1979, a number of songs by Moldavian composers appeared in her repertoire penned by the Teodorovici brothers. By that time, Rotaru had ceased collaboration with Moldavian authors, primarily Eugen Doga.

Rotaru&#x27;s songs of the period were created in collaboration with the following composers and lyricists: Arno Babajanian wrote &quot;Verni mne muzyku&quot; (&quot;Bring Me the Music Back&quot;); Aleksey Mazhukov – &quot;A muzyka zvuchit&quot; (&quot;But the Music Plays&quot;) and &quot;Krasnaya strela&quot; (&quot;Red Arrow&quot;); Pavel Aedonitskiy – &quot;Dlya tekh, kto zhdyot&quot; (&quot;For Those Who Wait&quot;); Oscar Feltsman - &quot;Only For You&quot;; David Tukhmanov – &quot;Aist na kryshe&quot; (&quot;Stork on the Roof&quot;), &quot;V dome moyom&quot; (&quot;At My Home&quot;), and &quot;Val&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Waltz&quot;); Yury Saulsky – &quot;A Usual Story&quot; and &quot;Osennyaya melodiya&quot; (&quot;Autumn Melody&quot;); Aleksandra Pakhmutova – &quot;Temp&quot; (&quot;Tempo&quot;); Raimonds Pauls – &quot;Tanets na barabane&quot; (&quot;Dance on the Drum&quot;); Aleksandr Zatsepin – &quot;Sovsem kak na Zemle&quot; (&quot;Just like on Earth&quot;); Vladimir Migulya – &quot;Zhyzn&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Life&quot;), and others.

She was the first performer of Eugene Martyunov&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Lebedinaya vernost&quot; (&quot;Swan Fidelity&quot;), &quot;Yabloni v tsvetu&quot; (&quot;Blossoming Apples&quot;), and &quot;Ballada o materi&quot; (&quot;Ballad About Mother&quot;). A patriotic song, &quot;Shchastye tebe, Zemlya moya&quot; (&quot;Be Happy, My Earth&quot;), caused some political controversy.

===1980–1983: Acting career and new connections===
In 1980, at the international song festival held in Tokyo, Rotaru won first prize for her performance of the Yugoslavian song &quot;Obeshchaniye&quot; (&quot;Promise&quot;) and received the Order of the Badge of Honor. She continued to experiment and was the first Soviet female singer to appear wearing trousers on stage. While doing this, she performed a hip-hop style song &quot;Temp&quot; (&quot;Tempo&quot;) with music composed by Aleksandra Pakhmutova and lyrics written by Nikolay Dobronravov. The songs &quot;Temp&quot; and &quot;Ozhidaniye&quot; (&quot;Waiting&quot;) were specially written for the cultural programme of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The song was used as the soundtrack theme for the drama film &quot;Ballada o sporte&quot; (&quot;Ode to sports&quot;), produced by Yuri Ozerov. In the same year, for her performance of &quot;Ozhidaniye&quot;, Rotaru won the All-Union Song of the Year award.

In 1980, Rotaru starred in the leading role in a film released by Moldova-Film and called &quot;Gde ty, lyubov&#x27;?&quot; (Where are you, love?). Among other songs in the film, Rotaru performed &quot;Pervy dozhd&#x27;&quot; (&quot;First Rain&quot;). The movie featured her riding a motorcycle on a narrow sea embankment without a stunt double. According to the autobiographic plot, a village teacher is invited to join an ensemble and wins the Grand Prix at an international festival with the song &quot;Gde ty, lyubov&#x27;?&quot;. The music for the song was composed by Raimonds Pauls and lyrics by Ilya Reznik. A double album of the soundtrack was released. More than 25 million movie goers viewed the film in 1980. The title song of the film was banned from state radio by Gennadiy Cherkassov, director of the music department.

In 1981, at the XIVth All-Union Cinema Festival in Vilnius, the film received the jury&#x27;s prize for popularisation of the singing art of Soviet composers, in the section of drama films. This movie was the first public exposure for Rotaru in a dramatic role. Critics lambasted the film but it garnered support from audiences and some of its themes became popular. Rotaru&#x27;s next artistic period began with a new style – rock music. The film &quot;Dusha&quot; (Soul) with Rotaru&#x27;s new rock band Mashina Vremeni was released in 1981, including songs by Aleksandr Zatsepin and Andrey Makarevich. As she was ill, her doctors recommended she not participate in the movie production and that she cancel all concert performances.

This incident caused Alexander Borodyansky and Alexander Stefanovich to write an autobiographical scenario for the film using the dramatic situation in the singer&#x27;s life, characterising her loss of voice with an opening of her soul. This was shown in dialogue on a pier with an older man and included a reevaluation of her values. After having seen the new rewritten scenario and new songs, written in a completely new style, Rotaru agreed to star in the movie and decided to temporarily forego all concert performances. In 1983, Rotaru performed a national concert tour of Canada, organised by the National Concert Agency Inc. The concerts were supported by the issue of an LP, titled &quot;Canadian Tour 1983&quot; and released by Cansov Exchange Inc.

===1985–1989: Change of style – Europop and hard rock===
The mid-1980s evolved into a turning point in the creation of the singer&#x27;s image. Contrary to the previous &quot;Vas priglashaet Sofia Rotaru&quot; (Sofia Rotaru Invites You) (1985), the new film &quot;Monologue of Love&quot; (1986) explored the aesthetics of the new art. Only one song, &quot;Techët voda&quot; (&quot;Water Flows&quot;) by Ihor Poklad, carried on the folk music theme, presenting an image of a farm girl who became a star.

A new collaboration began in 1985 with the song &quot;Lavanda&quot; (&quot;Lavender&quot;), written by Vladimir Matetskiy for a duet with Estonian Jaak Joala. In 1986, she reversed artistic direction with the relatively unknown Moscow songwriter. He managed the transition of Rotaru to a Europop style (&quot;Bylo no proshlo&quot; (&quot;Once It Was But Now It&#x27;s Over&quot;), &quot;Luna&quot; (&quot;Moon&quot;)), including elements of hard rock &quot;Moya vremya&quot; (&quot;My Time&quot;), &quot;Tol&#x27;ko etogo malo&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s Not Enough&quot;). During the next 15 years, Matetskiy and his co-author, Mikhail Shabrov, collaborated heavily with Rotaru. They produced songs, most of which became part of her concert programmes in 1990–2000.

===1990–1991: Among different cultures===
The transition to a repertoire in the Russian language caused a certain amount of animosity in Ukraine. Accusations in betrayal of national culture were supported by the state producer unions, philharmonic societies, and concert companies who were losing control over the financial side of the concert and tour activity of Rotaru as a result of economic reforms.

To avoid large scale provocations, she refused to participate in the Chervona Ruta festival which took place in Chernivtsi in 1989. The diminution of proportion of Ukrainian songs was caused by the absence of high-quality lyrics in Ukrainian. Rare exceptions included the songs of Mykola Mozghovyi, &quot;Krai, myi ridnyi krai&quot; (&quot;Homeland&quot;), &quot;Minaie den&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Day Passes&quot;); Blizniuk, &quot;Vidlunnia virnosti&quot; (&quot;Echo of Fidelity);&quot; Rybchinskyi, &quot;Bal razluchennykh serdets&quot; (&quot;Ball of Separate Hearts&quot;); and Kvinta, &quot;Chekai&quot; (&quot;Wait&quot;), &quot;Odna kalyna&quot; (&quot;Lone Guelder-Rose&quot;), &quot;Tuman&quot; (&quot;Fog&quot;).

In 1991, during a concert in Lviv, some people from the audience put up a poster in Ukrainian, translating into: &quot;Sofia, a heavy penalty is waiting for you&quot;. Due to the incident, Rotaru did not perform in Ukraine until the end of the 1990s, after a personal request by the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. At the same time, Rotaru prepared a new concert program, presented to the public in 1991.

===1991–2004: New times===
After the collapse of the USSR and commercialisation of post-Soviet music, Rotaru has kept her top position in the market and has a stable public, including the Russian speaking diaspora in Europe, USA, Australia and Israel. In 2000 Rotaru was named the Best Ukrainian Pop Singer of the Twentieth Century. In 2001 Rotaru performed in a new solo concert program &quot;Zhyzn&#x27; moya – moya lyubov&quot;&#x27; (My Life Is My Love). The programme blended new songs with the hits of the previous years in a new manner. In 2002 Sofia Rotaru was awarded the title &quot;Hero of Ukraine&quot;.

After the death of her husband in 2002, and the loss of her parents, Rotaru stopped touring for a period and joined a nunnery. Following several months of mourning, Rotaru resumed her concert and recording activities and topped the Russian, Ukrainian and Moldavian charts again.

A new period started in 2003 with performances in the &quot;Koncertny Zal &quot;Rossiya&quot;&quot; of Moscow, dedicated to the opening of her statue in front of the hall. Composers working with Rotaru included Ruslan Kvinta (&quot;Odna kalyna&quot;), Oleg Makarevič (&quot;Bely tanets&quot;) and Konstantin Meladze (&quot;Ya zhe yego lyubila&quot; and &quot;Odin na svete&quot;), as well as lyricist Vitalij Kurovskij. She released the following albums: &quot;Yedynomu&quot; (&quot;For the Only One&quot;, 2003; with new songs and arrangements in Ukrainian and Moldavian/Romanian languages), dedicated to the memory of her late husband (&quot;Nebo – eto ya&quot; (&quot;Heaven – It&#x27;s Me&quot;, 2004), and &quot;Ya zhe yego lyubila&quot; (&quot;Didn&#x27;t I Love Him&quot;, 2005).

===2007–2016: 60th Birthday ===
In 2007, she celebrated her 60th birthday. Hundreds of fans, as well as artists and politicians, came to Yalta to congratulate the singer. The President of Ukraine awarded Sofia Rotaru with the II Degree Order for Merits. Her official reception and birthday party took place at the Livadia Palace in Yalta, in the presence of the President of Russia, the President of Ukraine and the President of Moldova. The event was covered live by Ukrainian and Russian state TV channels. Celebrations for her birthday continued into September in Sochi, where one of the young performers&#x27; music festival days, called &quot;Five Stars&quot;, was dedicated to Rotaru. In October 2007, more birthday concerts took place in Moscow, at the State Grand Kremlin Palace, featuring Russian singers performing her songs.
2006 and 2007 were busy for Rotaru. Three albums were released: &quot;Tuman&quot; (&quot;Fog&quot;) in Eastern Europe, and two albums exclusively for the German market, &quot;Serdtse ty moë&quot; (You Are My Heart) and &quot;Kakaya na serdtse pogoda&quot; (What&#x27;s the Weather Like in the Heart). The year included participation in numerous TV shows and concert programmes and a documentary made for Ukrainian TV. A Russian Anniversary Tour lasted from March until June 2007. Another TV musical show, &quot;Krasota Trebuet&quot; (&quot;Beauty Requires&quot;), with Rotaru singing the song &quot;Lavanda&quot; (&quot;Lavender&quot;), premiered on 8 March 2008.

=== Anniversary Tour (2012 – 2013) ===

=== 2017–present ===
In 2022, she condemned the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.

==Politics==
Rotaru does not support any particular political ideology. Nevertheless, her multicultural identity has both helped and harmed her. Soviet authorities, persecuting her family for celebrating Christmas, simultaneously lauded her as the top singer of the USSR. The German press wrote about her as &quot;The Nana Mouskouri of the Soviet Union&quot;. Some of her albums were recorded in Germany. After recording &quot;L&#x27;immensità&quot; (&quot;Immensity&quot;) in Italian, and &quot;Wer Liebe sucht&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s Looking for Love&quot;) (&quot;Deine Zärtlichkeit&quot; (&quot;Your Tenderness&quot;), &quot;Es muss nicht sein&quot; (&quot;It Mustn&#x27;t Be&quot;), and &quot;Nachts, wenn die Nebel ziehen&quot; (&quot;At Night When the Fog Spreads&quot;) in German, Ariola proposed releasing a larger studio album with these and other songs in French and English, and launching a concert tour in Western Europe.

However, a directive came from the Soviet government (Goskontsert) to sing only Soviet songs. Thus, only the initial single was released &quot;Deine Zärtlichkeit&quot;. The concert administration of the USSR prohibited her from leaving the USSR between 1983 and 1988. This interdiction was put in effect after the 1983 tour in Canada and the release of her Canadian Tour 1983 album.

During the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Rotaru, together with her family, sent food packages to people who came to the &quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot;, regardless of their political affiliation. In 2006 Rotaru took active part in parliamentary elections in Ukraine, balloting for the deputy chair as a second number in the list of Volodymyr Lytvyn&#x27;s political formation Lytvyn Bloc; however, the bloc could not gather enough votes to enter Parliament, one of the major surprises of the elections. She held an all-Ukrainian charitable campaign tour the same year. Rotaru cited her personal trust of Lytvyn and his steadiness, as well as her own interest in lobbying for arts issues in Ukraine. As a Crimean resident, she refused Russian citizenship following Russia&#x27;s annexation of the peninsula.

==Personal life==
Aurica, Sofia&#x27;s younger sister, has also performed professionally, combining a solo career with performances as a back-up vocalist, as well as dueting with sisters Lidia and Eugenia. In 1992, Aurica ended her singing career. Sofia&#x27;s husband, Anatoliy Kyrylovich Yevdokymenko (1941–2002), was a People&#x27;s Artist of Ukraine. He was the son of a conductor from Chernivtsi. He first saw Rotaru on the cover of the magazine &quot;Ukraine&quot; No. 27 in 1965 and immediately fell in love with her. At the time, Yevdokymenko was a serving his military duty in Nizhny Tagil, Ural region. After military service, he looked Rotaru up. Yevdokymenko had graduated from a musical high school, played the trumpet, and planned to create his own band. As a student at the University of Chernivtsi and a trumpeter in the student pop orchestra, he helped Rotaru discover the pop orchestra.

Singing in different languages caused fierce arguments about which culture Rotaru identifies with: Moldavian/Romanian, Ukrainian, or Russian.

<text>Scolopendra heros, commonly known as the Arizona desert centipede, giant desert centipede, giant Sonoran centipede, Texas black-tailed centipede, Texas redheaded centipede, and giant redheaded centipede, is a species of North American centipede found in the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.

==Description==

&quot;S. heros&quot; is the largest centipede in North America. It has an average length of , but can reach up to in the wild, and even longer in captivity. Its trunk bears either 21 or 23 pairs of legs.

It is aposematically colored, to warn off potential predators, and a number of color variants are known in the species. The &quot;castaneiceps&quot; variant found in Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, and other nearby areas is commonly known as the &quot;giant redheaded centipede&quot; or &quot;Texas redheaded centipede&quot; because of its distinct red head and greenish black body and tail.

==Distribution and ecology==
&quot;S. heros&quot; is found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, from New Mexico and Arizona in the west to Arkansas, Missouri, and Louisiana in the east. Although this species is commonly referred to as the &quot;giant desert centipede&quot; because of its presence in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, and other arid and semi-arid habitats, &quot;S. heros&quot; is also found in rocky woodland areas, such as in Arkansas. It remains underground on warm days, emerging in cloudy weather.

== Hunting and diet ==
&quot;S. heros&quot; is primarily a nocturnal predator and hunts invertebrates and small vertebrates, including rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. It is capable of reaching into the air to grab small flying insects. The centipede uses its venom to subdue prey.

== Life cycle ==
&quot;S. heros&quot; hatch from eggs. As they grow and mature, like all arthropods they shed and molt away their exoskeleton. Each time they molt they enter a new stage of its life cycle called an instar. Like all Scolopendromorph centipedes, the number of segments they possess remains the same throughout their life. &quot;S. heros&quot; is a slow-growing species capable of living over a decade. 

=== Venom ===
The venom of &quot;S. heros&quot; is similar in composition to the venom of other &quot;Scolopendra&quot; species, including components such as serotonin, histamine, lipids, proteins (including cardiotoxic proteins and enzymes such as hemolytic phospholipase A), and other substances. The mixture is known to act as a cytolysin, compromising cellular membranes and rupturing cells. &quot;S. heros&quot; venom also contains toxins targeted to its prey: one toxin numbs the nervous system of insects, rendering them unable to sense or escape, while another toxin interferes with the autonomic nervous system of vertebrates to make small vertebrates easier to subdue and devour. The exact effects and makeup of the venom have not been thoroughly evaluated, in part because it is difficult to extract in significant quantities and quickly deteriorates when processed.

&quot;S. heros&quot; bites are very painful to vertebrates. A rat bitten by &quot;S. heros&quot; in the leg showed signs of excruciating pain, followed by soreness, but returned to normal after five hours. For humans, a bite from &quot;S. heros&quot; usually causes sharp, searing, local pain and swelling, but has never caused any confirmed deaths. &quot;S. heros&quot; bites are known to occasionally cause nausea, headache, and localized skin necrosis. However, there are individual cases of severe symptoms and injury (including kidney failure due to rhabdomyolysis, and heart attack) in humans resulting from &quot;Scolopendra&quot; bites.

<doc id="766442" wikidata="Q3528933" url="?curid=766442" title="Time Crisis II">
<text>Time Crisis II is a 1997 light-gun shooter video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It is the second installment in the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series. The game incorporates the same mechanics of its predecessor, with some minor changes, but with the addition of co-operative two-player gaming. The game&#x27;s story focuses on the efforts of two secret agents, Keith Martin and Robert Baxter, as they attempt to thwart the efforts of an industry mogul&#x27;s plan for world dominance.

The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 in October 2001, as part of a bundle to coincide with the launch of the GunCon 2 controller (G-Con 2 in Europe), with enhanced graphics. Ports for the original PlayStation and Dreamcast were cancelled during development. The game received mostly favorable reviews for the arcade and console versions. A sequel to the game, &quot;Time Crisis 3&quot;, was released in 2002.

==Gameplay==

The game utilizes the foot pedal system, just like &quot;Time Crisis&quot;, allowing players to hide from enemy fire. The &quot;crisis flash&quot; system alerts players when the enemy&#x27;s attack would cause a direct hit, a feature not present in its predecessor, &quot;Time Crisis&quot;. When pressing down on the pedal, the player comes out of hiding and can shoot enemies. Releasing the pedal puts the player behind cover to avoid bullets and reload the weapon, though the player cannot shoot while hiding. Certain sections of the game give players a machine gun with unlimited ammo.

The player loses a life if hit by a critical bullet or an obstacle, and the game ends when the player loses all lives. Players also lose a life if the time limit (which is replenished after each area is cleared) drops to zero, unlike the first game, where running out of time results in a game over. Players can continue from their current position, as opposed to the PlayStation version of &quot;Time Crisis&quot;, which requires players to restart from the beginning of a section.

This was the first &quot;Time Crisis&quot; game to enable two people to play simultaneously, allowing each player to cover the other. In single player, the computer controls the other character. The arcade version used connecting cabinets to allow another player to join. The PlayStation 2 version features split-screen and System Link functionality, which requires two televisions, two consoles, two copies of the game, and an iLink cable. Points are deducted for shooting the other player, though neither player will lose lives as a result. The same system is utilized for events in &quot;Time Crisis 3&quot; and &quot;Time Crisis 4&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1997, NeoDyne Industries announces it plan to launch a series of 64 satellites, codenamed the &quot;StarLine Network&quot;, that will help to unify the world&#x27;s communication networks. However, V.S.S.E. agent Christy Ryan discovers that the company&#x27;s CEO, Ernesto Diaz, plans to launch an experimental nuclear satellite into space and sell it to the highest bidder, and is using StarLine as a front. Escaping to a safehouse with a suitcase of incriminating data, she quickly finds herself tracked down and captured by NeoDyne mercenaries, led by Jakov Kinisky, moments before V.S.S.E. agents Keith Martin and Robert Baxter arrive to collect her. While Christy is taken to Diaz, Kinisky flees with the suitcase, forcing the agents to pursue him. After killing him during a boat chase, the pair retrieve the case and learn that the experimental satellite is being transported by train.

Locating the train, Keith and Robert board and attempt to destroy it, but are thwarted by NeoDyne forces led by Buff Bryant, who manages to extract the satellite by helicopter but dies battling the agents. Surviving the subsequent derailment, the agents hijack a mercenary helicopter and make their way to NeoDyne&#x27;s remote oceanic spaceport, encountering further resistance led by Wild Dog - a former crimeboss thought killed in a previous V.S.S.E. operation. Both agents are forced into a firefight with Dog, who keeps them at bay with a prosthetic minigun and additional assistance from Diaz, but is defeated. He escapes with self-detonation by explosives, leaving the agents to focus on the satellite.

After rescuing Christy, Keith and Robert focus on Diaz, who initiates the launch sequence before activating the defense system of a prototype satellite to engage them. With precious few seconds on the clock, Keith and Robert destroy the prototype and shoot Diaz in the chest, sending him falling to his death. Without him to finish the sequence, the rocket malfunctions and explodes. Christy fishes out Keith and Robert from the waters before the trio are extracted by the V.S.S.E. just as the rest of the base goes up in flames.

=== PlayStation 2 port ===

The PlayStation 2 version of the game featured enhanced graphics and additional cutscenes. It was packaged with the GunCon 2 lightgun peripheral, although it was also compatible with the GunCon 45. When completed enough times, the player could unlock alternative weapons, such as a machine gun or shotgun, and had the option of wielding two lightguns at a time (with combinations of both GunCon 2 and original GunCon possible). There is also a Crisis Mission mode, in which the players have to complete and perform various tasks, including a simulated gun duel against Richard Miller, the lead protagonist of the first &quot;Time Crisis&quot; game. Extras also included a clay pigeon shooting mode (including a port of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Shoot Away II&quot; light gun clay shooting arcade game), and a virtual port of the mechanical arcade game, &quot;Quick &amp; Crash&quot;.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Time Crisis II&quot; on their June 15, 1998 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the week. It went on to be the sixth Japanese highest-grossing arcade game of 1999 and 2001 respectively.

The game was met with positive reviews upon release. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the arcade version the award for 1998 Coin-Op of the Year, above &quot;Sega Rally 2&quot; and &quot;Get Bass&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; described &quot;Time Crisis II&quot;″s &quot;separate-screen&quot; two-player mode as &quot;one of the most convincing forms of cooperative play ever seen in the arcade&quot;. AllGame gave it a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version and commented: &quot;Not as big a milestone as the first, but definitely a superb game from Namco&quot;. They were less enthusiastic about the PlayStation 2 conversion, saying that while it was &quot;great for what it is&quot;, wasn&#x27;t as good as other lightgun shooters.

Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0–100 range, calculated an average score of 81 out of 100 (&quot;Favorable&quot;) for the PlayStation 2 version, based on reviews from 21 professional critics. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; scoring &quot;Time Crisis II&quot; with GunCon 2 bundle a score of 32 out of 40. the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Time Crisis II&quot; was a nominee for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for &quot;Best Console Shooter Game&quot;, but lost to &quot;&quot;.

<text>Orbassano (; ) is a (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont, located about southwest of Turin.

Orbassano borders the following municipalities: Turin, Rivoli, Rivalta di Torino, Beinasco, Nichelino, Volvera, Candiolo, None.

==History==
The known origins of the city date back to the Roman conquest of Cisalpine Gaul, evidenced by two Imperial era tombstones found here in the second half of the nineteenth century.

By the end of the first millennium, Orbassano was among the lands of the Margrave of Susa, but in 1029 it found itself sold by Manfredi to the new Abbey of San Giusto in Susa. Shortly thereafter, in 1035, some of the land came into the possession of the Diocese of Turin. In the twelfth century Orbassano came under the control of its northern neighbours the Lords of Rivalta, the Orsini family.

==People==
Sonia Gandhi was raised here, although she was born in Lusiana, near Vicenza.

==Twin towns ==

Orbassano is twinned with:
* Ełk, Poland (since 2010)

<doc id="766470" wikidata="Q317863" url="?curid=766470" title="Mário Jardel">
<text>Mário Jardel de Almeida Ribeiro (; born 18 September 1973) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He was most noted for his positioning on the field and his heading ability. He was a legend for Grêmio, playing a major part in the squad that won the 1995 Copa Libertadores. With his exceptional positioning ability, he was able to become one of Europe&#x27;s most prolific strikers during his time at Porto, Galatasaray, and Sporting CP, scoring 206 goals in 274 matches for those clubs.

After leaving Sporting CP in 2003 at age 29, Jardel had a succession of brief and unsuccessful stints at clubs in England, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Argentina and Australia. He then played for several smaller clubs in Brazil before retiring in 2011.

Jardel made his debut for the Brazil national team in 1996, making a total of 10 appearances and being selected for the 2001 Copa América.

==Club career==

===Brazil===
Jardel played first for Vasco da Gama, but moved in 1995 to Grêmio, where he played a major role in the squad that won the 1995 Copa Libertadores, scoring 12 goals to be crowned the tournament&#x27;s top goal scorer, including a hat-trick in the quarter-finals against Roberto Carlos&#x27; Palmeiras, and a goal in the final against Atlético Nacional.

===Porto===
In 1996, Jardel was linked to several teams, and after failing to transfer to Benfica and Rangers (due to the strict British rules involving non-EU players), he signed with Portuguese side Porto, where with help from players such as Zlatko Zahovič, Sérgio Conceição and Ljubinko Drulović, he was the top goalscorer in Europe for three years (1998–99, 1999–00, 2001–02), with a goal average of slightly over one goal &quot;per&quot; match (129 goals in 125 matches for an average of 1.03 &quot;per&quot; match). Although he was top scorer three times, due to the use of coefficients based on each European league&#x27;s standards, he only won twice, the 1998–99 and 2001–02 European Golden Boots. He lost out to Kevin Phillips in 1999–2000 despite Phillips having scored six fewer goals than Jardel.

In a 2014 interview, Jardel revealed that, during his spell at Porto, he consumed cocaine with the knowledge of both the club&#x27;s doctor and physiotherapist.

===Galatasaray===
Before the 2000–01 season, Jardel was sold to Turkish club Galatasaray, winners of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup as the club activated his release clause of US$16 million.

Scoring five goals in his debut match in the Süper Lig suggested Jardel would adapt well to his new club, but towards the end of the season, injuries and growing personal problems hinted he was soon going to leave Turkey. Regardless, he was part of the Galatasaray squad that won the 2000 UEFA Super Cup, himself scoring twice with a golden goal to beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the Super Cup match, and reached the quarter-finals of the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League, with Jardel scoring six goals in the competition and helped in victories against teams such as Rangers, Deportivo de La Coruña, Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Milan and Real Madrid. He ended the season with 34 goals.

===Sporting CP===
In 2001–02, Jardel returned to Portugal; Sporting CP signed him on the last day of transfer window and offered a contract worth €11 million over three seasons. Sporting transferred Galatasaray three players: Mbo Mpenza, Robert Spehar and Pavel Horváth (valued €3.4 million), as well as US$5 million in cash.

The 2001–02 season proved hugely successful for Jardel, as he scored 42 goals in 30 matches (17 via penalties) as Sporting CP won both the Primeira Liga and the Taça de Portugal. He also won Portuguese Footballer of the Year by &quot;Record&quot; newspaper, one of the only two foreign players to achieve this, the other being the Argentinian Lisandro López.

===Decline===
While the 2001–02 season was arguably the best of Jardel&#x27;s career, the following 2002–03 season proved to be the beginning of the end. Again omitted from the Brazil national team squad, this time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup (despite his tremendous goal-scoring abilities he was rarely called up), and unfit at the start of the season, he spent the year on the injury list.

During the Christmas break, Jardel returned to his native Fortaleza, where he injured his knee in a swimming pool fall. He scored only nine goals that season. He was granted, alongside Deco, Portuguese citizenship in February 2003.

In August 2003, Jardel moved to English club Bolton Wanderers, with Sporting CP to receive a transfer fee up to €1.5 million based on his performances in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons. However, Jardel failed to score a league goal for the club, though he scored three goals in the League Cup, where Bolton were eventually losing finalists. These goals came in matches against Walsall, where Jardel scored twice, and Liverpool at Anfield.

During the winter break, Jardel went on loan to Italian side Ancona, but could not convince the staff of his physical capabilities. Ancona supporters called him &quot;lardel&quot; (a pun on the Italian &quot;lardo&quot;, meaning lard) due to him being overweight. Regarding his debut against Milan, an Italian journalist also said, &quot;We stretch a veil of silence in respect of what he has been.&quot;

In August 2004, Jardel signed a contract with Argentine club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, for which Bolton did not receive any transfer fee.

In September 2005, Jardel signed a contract with Brazilian first-division side Goiás until 31 December 2006.

Jardel returned to Portugal to sign for Beira Mar for the 2006–07 season, for an undisclosed fee. Despite arriving at the club overweight, he worked hard and trained specifically to lose weight and gain physical form and scored one goal on his debut for Beira-Mar in a 2–2 draw against Desportivo das Aves. In the winter transfer season, Jardel signed for the Cypriot team Anorthosis Famagusta.

On 14 July 2007, Jardel played for Scottish Premier League club St Mirren, as a trialist in a 3–0 win over first division side Stirling Albion.

===Newcastle Jets===
On 14 August 2007, Australian A-League side Newcastle United Jets officially announced at a press conference in Newcastle they had signed Jardel on a one-year contract as their marquee player. Jardel was rumoured to join the club for weeks before the official announcement was made. He arrived in Australia on 12 August 2007 and traveled to Newcastle on 13 August.

Jardel worked hard on his fitness before arriving in Newcastle. He was unable to play for the Jets in the first three rounds as he was in Australia on a tourist visa. He eventually had his sport visa approved before the start of Round 4. He made his debut as a substitute in the 70th minute at EnergyAustralia Stadium against Adelaide United in Round 4. Newcastle won the match 1–0 with a strike from Mark Bridge in the 81st minute.

After joining the Jets, Jardel saw little game time, usually making an appearance as a late substitute. The owner of Newcastle Jets, Con Constantine, who brought Jardel to Newcastle, expressed his desire for Jardel to stay on the field for longer. However, Newcastle head coach Gary van Egmond was reluctant to give the Brazilian a larger role.

On 3 November 2007, Jardel played nearly 20 minutes against Sydney FC. He showed some positive signs, nearly equalising for Newcastle with a trademark header from a Joel Griffiths corner kick. Sydney goalkeeper Clint Bolton saved the initial header before Jardel&#x27;s follow-up was cleared off the line.

However, after showing glimpses of class, manager van Egmond perceived Jardel to be surplus to requirements and was told he could leave the club halfway through the season. He was reportedly being paid $3,000 &quot;per&quot; week by club owner Con Constantine. He left the club on 24 January 2008 to be with his sick mother in Brazil. The Jets went on to win the 2008 A-League Grand Final.

===Brazil lower divisions (2008–10)===
On 29 June 2008, Jardel joined Campeonato Brasileiro Série B club Criciúma. He scored four goals in the Brazilian Serie B season 2008. Unfortunately for Jardel his club, was relegated from Serie B; finishing 18th with 41 points from 38 games.

Jardel joined to Ferroviário on 4 February 2009. On 11 March 2009, Jardel made his Ferroviário debut with a very classy goal, a reminder of his past years of glory as one of the best finishers ever to play on the Portuguese Liga. In August 2009 he signed a 6-month contract with América de Fortaleza, but released on 30 October 2009.

On 20 January 2010, Jardel signed a contract until the end of 2010 Campeonato Piauiense with Esporte Clube Flamengo. He became a free agent on 10 June 2010.

===Cherno More===
On 27 June 2010, Jardel arrived in Varna, Bulgaria in order to negotiate terms with Bulgarian club Cherno More Varna. A day later, on 28 June 2010, Jardel signed a one-year contract with the Sailors and was officially presented as a new signing of the club. Jardel was welcomed by 500 fans at his presentation at the Ticha Stadium. He made his new club debut on 17 July, in a friendly match against Romanian side Victoria Brăneşti, with the match ending in a 2–2 draw.

Jardel made his competitive debut for the Sailors during the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010 in a 0–2 away loss against Lokomotiv Plovdiv, coming on as a substitute for compatriot Marco Tiago. In the next round of A PFG Mário played 26 minutes as a substitute for a 1–0 home win against Akademik Sofia. On 31 October 2010, he scored his first goal for the Bulgarian team, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Lokomotiv Sofia.
On 28 November 2010, it was reported that Jardel had left Cherno More, in part due to concerns pertaining to the cold weather conditions in Bulgaria.

===Atlético Rio Negro Clube===
On 21 December 2010, it was reported that Jardel signed a one-year deal with Atlético Rio Negro Clube from Manaus, Amazonas.

==International career==
Jardel was capped for the national team first when he was 19 years old. In March 1993, Jardel capped one time for the Brazil national under-20 football team during the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Australia. Brazil became champions of the tournament.

Jardel&#x27;s debut for the &quot;Seleção&quot; was as a substitute replacing Ronaldo during a friendly game against Russia in August 1996.
He was also a part of the national team squad during the Copa América tournament in 2001.

==Political career==
In the 2014 general election, Jardel was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Social Democratic Party ticket, with 41,000 votes.

According to Brazil&#x27;s Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, Jardel and 10 other people have extorted staff, nominated fake members and diverted funds for their own benefit. The Prosecutor&#x27;s Office finished the accusation in February 2016 as a result of the investigation started in 2015 (Operação Gol Contra), triggering the process to terminate Jardel&#x27;s term in the Chamber of Deputies. Fellow politician Marlon Santos stated at the time that Jardel was involved in activities &quot;which are not compatible with parliamentary ethics&quot;. Jardel was also accused by Santos of being involved in drug trafficking, with Santos stating &quot;There is clear proof that the car allocated by the parliament has been used to drive drug dealers around&quot;.

On 8 June 2016, the Parliament Ethics commission approved the request to terminate Jardel&#x27;s term. The case was transferred to the Constitution and Justice Commission, who approved the case in December 2016. A final vote was held in the Parliament in December 2016 where it was unanimously decided to terminate Jardel&#x27;s term.

<text>Michael Delaney Dowd Jr. (August 11, 1920 – August 11, 2006), known as Mike Douglas, was an American &quot;Big Band&quot; era singer, entertainer, television talk show host of &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and actor.

==Early life==

Dowd was born in Chicago, Illinois. His birth year has been called into question, with years ranging from 1920 to 1925 having been given as his year of birth at some point. His family later moved to Forest Park, Illinois, where he attended Proviso Township High School, but left the school after his second year. After that, he began singing as a choirboy.

==Career==
By his teens, Dowd was working as a singer at nightclubs and on a Lake Michigan dinner cruise ship. He was a &quot;staff singer&quot; at the Oklahoma City radio station WKY. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II on a munitions ship, he resumed his performing career as a staff singer for WMAQ-TV in Chicago. He moved to Los Angeles. He was on the Ginny Simms radio show. After that, Douglas joined the big band of Kay Kyser as a singer.

Although big band swing faded from popularity, Kyser had to continue performing due to contractual obligations, and continued to log a few hits with Douglas, including two notable hits, &quot;Ole [or Old] Buttermilk Sky&quot; in 1946 and &quot;The Old Lamp-Lighter&quot; the following year. Kyser was responsible for giving Douglas his show business name, and Douglas continued to perform with the band until Kyser retired in 1951 due to health problems. In 1950, he provided the singing voice of Prince Charming in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

In 1953, Douglas was host of &quot;Showcase&quot;, a weekly program on WGN-TV in Chicago, and he sang on &quot;The Music Show&quot; on the DuMont Television Network. In 1957 Douglas was one of the Band Singers on Dennis James&#x27; &quot;Club 60&quot; a daily talk show on NBC out of Chicago. Douglas and James remained lifelong friends, with James occasionally serving as a co-host on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in Los Angeles in the 1970s.

Then living in Burbank, California, Douglas tried to keep his singing career going in the late 1950s working as house singer for a nightclub and traveling to perform elsewhere. By the middle of the decade, rock and roll and doo wop had taken over the charts, which left many older performers in the musical dustbin. In the leanest years, Douglas and his wife survived by successfully &quot;flipping&quot; their Los Angeles homes.

==Talk show==
Douglas next appeared in 1961 in Cleveland, where a onetime Chicago colleague hired him for $400 a week as an afternoon television talk-show host at KYW-TV. &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; rapidly gained popularity, and ultimately, national syndication in August 1963 on other stations owned by KYW-TV&#x27;s parent company Westinghouse Broadcasting. The show was broadcast live on KYW-TV in its city of origination, but this practice ended in 1965 after guest Zsa Zsa Gabor used the phrase &quot;son of a bitch&quot; when referring to stand-up comedian and comic actor Morey Amsterdam of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

Both Douglas and his program relocated to Philadelphia in 1965 after Westinghouse Broadcasting moved KYW-TV&#x27;s operations to that city, the result of a Federal Communications Commission-ordered reversal of Westinghouse&#x27;s 1956 station ownership swap with NBC. &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; aired its first Philadelphia-based show on August 30, 1965; the former KYW-TV in Cleveland, which is now NBC-owned WKYC, continued to carry the program for many years afterward. The format called for Douglas to invite guests to appear as co-hosts for the week; they would be on the show for all five weekdays. Guests ranged from Truman Capote, Richard Nixon, Jerry Lewis, and Edward Everett Horton to The Rolling Stones, Herman&#x27;s Hermits and Kiss, with an occasional on-camera appearance by Tim Conway (who would later be discovered at WJW-TV, also in Cleveland). Moe Howard of The Three Stooges was a guest several times, with a pie fight inevitably happening at the end of the interview, and platform speaker on nonverbal communication (body language) Dr. Cody Sweet. The show helped introduce entertainers such as Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin.

After the move to Philadelphia, Douglas also attempted to revive his own singing career, logging his lone Top 40 single as a solo artist, &quot;The Men in My Little Girl&#x27;s Life&quot;, in 1966. By 1967, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; was broadcast to 171 markets and 6,000,000 viewers each day, mostly women at home. It earned $10.5 million annually from advertisers, while its host was paid more than $500,000. In 1967, the program received the first Emmy Award for Individual Achievement in Daytime Television from the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. At the peak of his career, he was earning $2 million a year.

The afternoon show was usually quiet with an eclectic mix and such an approach would occasionally lead to confrontation, such as when soul singer James Brown took offense at racially charged comments from talk show host/producer David Susskind, who wondered on-air why black students often did not mix with white students, even after civil rights legislation and advances in integration. It got heated when Brown defended those who chose to learn first about themselves, having been systematically denied to do so, for centuries. Douglas never “muzzled“ his guests, as flamboyant as many were. Pop-soul co-host Sly Stone&#x27;s hyperactive behavior clashed with the calm deportment of Muhammad Ali in a 1974 show. Little Richard, a 1950s rock and roll originator, by 1969 was on a serious comeback bid and his many appearances with Douglas gave him a boost. In 1970, Douglas hired rocker Bobby Darin as co-host, just after the latter radically changed his image from lounge entertainer to folk artist Bob Darin. It appears, he would only sing his greatest hit “Mack the Knife”, if he could rewrite a verse to fit his changes. So Douglas was partially successful in expressing the wishes of fans, who demanded the original Bobby Darin.

Douglas invited John Lennon and Yoko Ono on the show to co-host for a full week in 1972, and there were some awkward moments with Yoko&#x27;s avant-garde art displays and with radical guests, John and Yoko&#x27;s friends. Chuck Berry, Ralph Nader, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale, Yellow Pearl (Nobuko JoAnne Miyamoto, Chris Iijima), Vivian Reed, David Rosenboom and George Carlin appeared on the program.

In July 1978, the talk show&#x27;s home base was transferred to Los Angeles, where it remained until finally going off the air in 1981. Near the end of its run, the series switched to a traveling roadshow format and became &quot;The Mike Douglas Entertainment Hour&quot;, but this change failed to boost falling ratings. After a 20-year run, Westinghouse canceled the Mike Douglas program and replaced him with singer and TV personality John Davidson. The Davidson show, using a similar format, had a comparatively brief run, ending in 1982.

After Douglas&#x27;s Westinghouse series was canceled, Douglas hosted CNN&#x27;s Los Angeles-based celebrity interview show, &quot;People Now&quot;, taking over the hosting duties from Lee Leonard. He was replaced in January 1983 by WTBS personality Bill Tush.

==Other notable achievements==
Douglas became a local cultural icon in Philadelphia, often inviting prominent players from the city&#x27;s professional sports teams to be guests on his show (he had a particular affinity for the city&#x27;s pro football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, constantly referring to the team as &quot;Our Eagles&quot;, and he could often be seen in attendance at Eagles&#x27; home games, especially whenever they appeared on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;). He also assisted in mayor Frank Rizzo&#x27;s campaign against derisive jokes often told by outsiders about the city, acting as chief spokesperson for the &quot;Anti-Defamation Agency&quot; Rizzo had set up for this purpose. He also held a landmark interview with Dr. Martin Luther King that revealed his wisdom about civil rights and his prophetic stance on the Vietnam war.

In February 1976, Hollywood recognized Douglas&#x27; contribution to television, honoring him with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located on Hollywood Boulevard.

Douglas sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before the first Philadelphia Phillies game at Veterans Stadium on April 10, 1971, and also sang the national anthem prior to a Cincinnati Bengals–Miami Dolphins playoff game on December 23, 1973. He wrote two memoirs: &quot;My Story&quot; (1979) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Right Back: Memories of TV&#x27;s Greatest Talk Show&quot; (1999). He also wrote a cookbook, &quot;The Mike Douglas Cookbook&quot; (1969), featuring recipes from him, his family, and the show&#x27;s guests. 40 years after Douglas began his talk show at KYW-TV, his granddaughter Debbie Voinovich Donley designed successor WKYC&#x27;s new broadcast facility on Lakeside Avenue, completed in 2002. In 2007, a new documentary film &quot;Mike Douglas: Moments and Memories&quot; was shown on PBS stations. The Lily Tomlin comedy &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot; shows the dwindling Pat Kramer appearing on Douglas&#x27;s show, where he sings &quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot; in her honor.

==Personal life==
Douglas married Genevieve, the marriage producing three daughters: Kelly and twins Michele and Christine, and he had several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Douglas developed prostate cancer in 1990, but after surgery, he was cancer-free and remained in good health until almost the end of his life. He died unexpectedly on August 11, 2006, his 86th birthday, at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. In media reports, he was usually cited as being five years younger than his true age. He claimed to be 36 years old, instead of 40, when he got his show.

Although the exact cause of his death was not revealed, his widow, Genevieve, told the Associated Press that he became dehydrated while golfing a few weeks earlier on a hot Florida summer day. Douglas was treated at a hospital following this episode, but he was apparently unable to recover. His body was interred in Riverside Memorial Park cemetery in Martin County, Florida.

==Legacy==
The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Douglas into their Hall of Fame in 2006.

<doc id="766481" wikidata="Q115632713" url="?curid=766481" title="Electronic voting machine">
<text>An electronic voting machine is a voting machine based on electronics. 
Two main technologies exist: &quot;optical scanning&quot; and &quot;direct recording&quot; (DRE).

==Optical scanning==


In an optical scan voting system, or marksense, each voter&#x27;s choices are marked on one or more pieces of paper, which then go through a scanner. The scanner creates an electronic image of each ballot, interprets it, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review.

The voter may mark the paper directly, usually in a specific location for each candidate. Or the voter may select choices on an electronic screen, which then prints the chosen names, and a bar code or QR code summarizing all choices, on a sheet of paper to put in the scanner.

Hundreds of errors in optical scan systems have been found, from feeding ballots upside down, multiple ballots pulled through at once in central counts, paper jams, broken, blocked or overheated sensors which misinterpret some or many ballots, printing which does not align with the programming, programming errors, and loss of files. The cause of each programming error is rarely found, so it is not known how many were accidental or intentional.

==Direct-recording electronic (DRE)==


In a DRE voting machine system, a touch screen displays choices to the voter, who selects choices, and can change their mind as often as needed, before casting the vote. Staff initialize each voter once on the machine, to avoid repeat voting. Voting data are recorded in memory components, and can be copied out at the end of the election.

Some of these machines also print names of chosen candidates on paper for the voter to verify, though less than 40% verify. These names on paper are kept behind glass in the machine, and can be used for election audits and recounts if needed. The tally of the voting data is printed on the end of the paper tape. The paper tape is called a Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). The VVPATs can be tallied at 20–43 seconds of staff time per vote (not per ballot).

For machines without VVPAT, there is no record of individual votes to check. For machines with VVPAT, checking is more expensive than with paper ballots, because on the flimsy thermal paper in a long continuous roll, staff often lose their place, and the printout has each change by each voter, not just their final decisions.

Problems have included public web access to the software, before it is loaded into machines for each election, and programming errors which increment different candidates than voters select. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that with existing machines could not be allowed because they could not be monitored by the public.

Successful hacks have been demonstrated under laboratory conditions.

<doc id="766488" wikidata="Q6770949" url="?curid=766488" title="Marketplace of ideas">
<text>The marketplace of ideas is a rationale for freedom of expression based on an analogy to the economic concept of a free market. The marketplace of ideas holds that the truth will emerge from the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse and concludes that ideas and ideologies will be culled according to their superiority or inferiority and widespread acceptance among the population. The concept is often applied to discussions of patent law as well as freedom of the press and the responsibilities of the media in a liberal democracy.

==History==
Support for competing ideas and robust debate can be found in the philosophy of John Milton in his work &quot;Areopagitica&quot; in 1644 and also John Stuart Mill in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; in 1859. The general idea that free speech should be tolerated because it will lead toward the truth has a long history. English poet John Milton suggested that restricting speech was not necessary because &quot;in a free and open encounter&quot; truth would prevail. President Thomas Jefferson argued that it is safe to tolerate &quot;error of opinion ... where reason is left free to combat it&quot;. Fredrick Siebert echoed the idea that free expression is self-correcting in &quot;Four Theories of the Press&quot;: &quot;Let all with something to say be free to express themselves. The true and sound will survive. The false and unsound will be vanquished. Government should keep out of the battle and not weigh the odds in favor of one side or the other&quot;. These writers did not rely on the economic analogy to a market.

Economic historian Joel Mokyr argues in his 2017 book &quot;A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy&quot; that political fragmentation in Europe (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India. China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an &quot;integrated market for ideas&quot; where Europe&#x27;s intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe&#x27;s classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the Republic of Letters.

However, the more precise metaphor of a marketplace of ideas comes from the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States. The first reference to the &quot;free trade in ideas&quot; within &quot;the competition of the market&quot; appears in 1919 within US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;. The actual phrase &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice William O. Douglas in the Supreme Court decision &quot;United States v. Rumely&quot;: &quot;Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas.&quot; The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1969 decision in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in American free speech law (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons, the 1976 decision &quot;Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council&quot; expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process. It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence, but the legacy of those decisions have led to subsequent decisions like &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; that curtailed the government&#x27;s ability to regulate corporate speech and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political than Americans had experienced previously.

If beliefs such as religions are regarded as ideas, the marketplace-of-ideas concept favors a marketplace of religions - with competition in the religious sphere to win hearts and minds - rather than (for example) forcing a state religion, favoring an established church, or forbidding &quot;incompatible&quot; beliefs. In this sense, the marketplace of ideas provides a rationale for freedom of religion.

==Reliability==
In recent years, questions have arisen regarding the existence of markets in ideas. Several scholars have noted differences between the way ideas are produced and consumed and the way more traditional goods are produced and consumed. It has also been argued that the idea of the marketplace of ideas as applied to religion &quot;incorrectly assumes a level playing field&quot; among religions. Additionally, the idea of a marketplace of ideas has been applied to the study of scientific research as a social institution. Some scholars have also questioned whether free speech advocates have relied upon the idea of the &quot;marketplace of ideas,&quot; offering other reasons for the importance of free speech.

<doc id="766490" wikidata="Q377997" url="?curid=766490" title="Boris Vallejo">
<text>Boris Vallejo (born January 8, 1941) is a Peruvian-American painter who works in the science fiction, fantasy, and erotica genres. His hyper-representational paintings have appeared on the covers of numerous science fiction, sword and sorcery, and fantasy fiction novels and movie posters. They are also sold through a series of annual calendars.

==Early biography ==
Born in 1941 in Lima, Peru, Vallejo began painting at the age of 13, in 1954, and obtained his first illustration job three years later in 1957 at the age of 16. He attended Escuela Nacional Superior Autónoma de Bellas Artes on a five-year scholarship, and was awarded a prize medal.

==Career==
After emigrating to the United States in 1964, at the age of 23, he quickly garnered a fan following from his illustrations of Tarzan, Conan the Barbarian, Doc Savage, and various other fantasy characters (often done for paperback-fiction works featuring the characters). This led to commissions for movie-poster illustration, advertisement illustration, and artwork for various collectibles, including Franklin Mint paraphernalia, trading cards, and sculpture. Along with his wife Julie Bell, Vallejo presents his artwork in an annual calendar and various books. 

Vallejo&#x27;s preferred artistic medium is oil on board, and he has previously used photographs to combine discrete images to form composite images. Preparatory works are pencil or ink sketches, which have been displayed in the book &quot;Sketchbook&quot;. He and Julie Bell have worked on collaborative artworks together, in which they sign the artwork with both names.

Vallejo has produced film posters for numerous fantasy and action movies, including &quot;Knightriders&quot; (1981), &quot;Q&quot; (1982), and &quot;Barbarian Queen&quot; (1985). He has also illustrated posters for comedies, notably &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; (1991) and &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; (2007), co-created with Bell.

He illustrated the 1978 Tarzan calendar. His sea serpent paintings hang in the queue of Loch Ness Monster, a rollercoaster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg.

His art was also featured in the 1995 card game Hyborian Gates.

==Awards==
He received the Inkpot Award in 1978. He received the British Fantasy Award for best artist in 1979 for his painting &quot;The Amazon Princess and her Pet&quot;. Vallejo also won the 2011 Chesley Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, and the 2014 Chesley Award for Best Product Illustration.

<doc id="766493" wikidata="Q748111" url="?curid=766493" title="Hellas Planitia">
<text>Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the fourth- or fifth-largest known impact crater in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon&#x27;s South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at It features the lowest point on Mars, serves as a known source of global dust storms, and may have contained lakes and glaciers. Hellas Planitia spans the boundary between the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle.

==Description==
With a diameter of about , it is the largest unambiguous well-exposed impact structure on the planet; the obscured Utopia Planitia is slightly larger (the Borealis Basin, if it proves to be an impact crater, is considerably larger). Hellas Planitia is thought to have been formed during the Late Heavy Bombardment period of the Solar System, approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago, when a protoplanet or large asteroid, suggested to be around in diameter, hit the surface.

The altitude difference between the rim and the bottom is over . Despite being deeper than the Moon&#x27;s South Pole-Aitken basin, Hellas&#x27; rim peaks are significantly less prominent. This may be because large Martian impacts such as Hellas induced global hot rainfall and meltwater flows that degraded crater rims, including their own.
The crater&#x27;s depth of below the topographic datum of Mars explains the atmospheric pressure at the bottom: 12.4 mbar (1240 Pa or 0.18 psi) during winter, when the air is coldest and reaches its highest density. This is 103% higher than the pressure at the topographical datum (610 Pa, or 6.1 mbar, or 0.09 psi) and above the triple point of water, suggesting that the liquid phase could be present under certain conditions of temperature, pressure, and dissolved salt content. It has been theorized that a combination of glacial action and explosive boiling may be responsible for gully features in the crater.

Some of the low elevation outflow channels extend into Hellas from the volcanic Hadriacus Mons complex to the northeast, two of which Mars Orbiter Camera images show contain gullies: Dao Vallis and Reull Vallis. These gullies are also low enough for liquid water to be transient around Martian noon, if the temperature were to rise above 0 Celsius.

Hellas Planitia is antipodal to Alba Patera. It and the somewhat smaller Isidis Planitia together are roughly antipodal to the Tharsis Bulge, with its enormous shield volcanoes, while Argyre Planitia is roughly antipodal to Elysium, the other major uplifted region of shield volcanoes on Mars. Whether the shield volcanoes were caused by antipodal impacts like that which produced Hellas, or if it is mere coincidence, is unknown.

==Discovery and naming==
Due to its size and its light coloring, which contrasts with the rest of the planet, Hellas Planitia was one of the first Martian features discovered from Earth by telescope. Before Giovanni Schiaparelli gave it the name Hellas (which in Greek means &quot;Greece&quot;), it was known as Lockyer Land, having been named by Richard Anthony Proctor in 1867 in honor of Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer who, using a refractor, produced &quot;the first really truthful representation of the planet&quot; (in the estimation of E. M. Antoniadi).

==Possible glaciers==
Radar images by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft&#x27;s SHARAD radar sounder suggest that features called lobate debris aprons in three craters in the eastern region of Hellas Planitia are actually glaciers of water ice lying buried beneath layers of dirt and rock. The buried ice in these craters as measured by SHARAD is about thick on the upper crater and about and on the middle and lower levels respectively. Scientists believe that snow and ice accumulated on higher topography, flowed downhill, and is now protected from sublimation by a layer of rock debris and dust. Furrows and ridges on the surface were caused by deforming ice.

Also, the shapes of many features in Hellas Planitia and other parts of Mars are strongly suggestive of glaciers, as the surface looks as if movement has taken place.
==Honeycomb terrain==
These relatively flat-lying &quot;cells&quot; appear to have concentric layers or bands, similar to a honeycomb. This &quot;honeycomb terrain&quot; was first discovered in the northwestern part of Hellas. The geologic process responsible for creating these features remains unresolved. Some calculations indicate that this formation may have been caused by ice moving up through the ground in this region. The ice layer would have been between 100 m and 1 km thick. When one substance moves up through another denser substance, it is called a diapir. So, it seems that large masses of ice have pushed up layers of rock into domes that were subsequently eroded. After erosion removed the top of the layered domes, circular features remained.

* Hellas Basin was a primary location in the 2017 video game &quot;Destiny 2&quot;. The location is part of the second game&#x27;s &quot;Warmind&quot; downloadable content.
* It is also featured as a main location in the 2016 Bethesda video game reboot &quot;Doom&quot;.
*In &quot;Planet-Size X-Men #1&quot;, the X-Men terraform Mars, turning the basin into Lake Hellas and building the Lake Hellas Diplomatic Ring, where galactic ambassadors can meet within the Sol system.

<text>: &quot;For the radioactive mineral, see Cleveite.&quot;

Clevite, Inc. was a Cleveland, Ohio based manufacturing company, founded as the Cleveland Graphite Bronze Company. The company was a leading producer of Babbit bearings and a significant US government defense contractor. The bearings were licensed in Britain to Vandervell Products Ltd; W. A. Robotham of Rolls-Royce said that &quot;it was an exceedingly difficult task for Tony Vandervell ... knowing the American company well&quot;. 

In 1952 the Cleveland Graphite Bronze Company absorbed the Brush Development Company and Brush Labs in a merger. In 1953 it acquired 51% of Transistor Products Inc., and with other acquisitions such as the German &quot;Intermetall&quot; in 1955 (a company founded in 1952 by pioneering German physicist and developer of the first &quot;European&quot; transistor Herbert Mataré, and subsequently sold to telecommunications giant ITT in 1965) developed a semiconductor division.

By 1959, over one-third of Clevite&#x27;s sales were in electronics, split over four units: Clevite Transistor Prods.; Brush Instruments; Clevite Electronic Components; and Clevite Ordnance. Clevite won defense contracts for some of its products and opened a new ordnance plant in 1967. Clevite purchased Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1960 and continued operating it until selling it (again to ITT as it had done with Intermetall) in 1968.

In 1969, Clevite was acquired by Gould-National Batteries, a firm one-quarter its size. It adopted the Gould name in the hopes of having better brand recognition in the marketplace.

<doc id="766495" wikidata="Q285784" url="?curid=766495" title="Yus">
<text>Little yus (Ѧ, ѧ; italics: &quot;Ѧ, ѧ&quot;) and big yus (Ѫ, ѫ; italics: &quot;Ѫ, ѫ&quot;), or jus, are letters of the Cyrillic script representing two Common Slavonic nasal vowels in the early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets. Each can occur in iotated form (Ѩ ѩ, Ѭ ѭ), formed as ligatures with the decimal i (І). Other yus letters are blended yus (Ꙛ ꙛ), closed little yus (Ꙙ ꙙ) and iotated closed little yus (Ꙝ ꙝ),and iotated blended yus.()

Phonetically, little yus represents a nasalized front vowel, possibly (like the French ‘in’ in “cinq” or Polish &#x27;ę&#x27; in “kęs”), while big yus represents a nasalized back vowel, such as IPA (like the French ‘on’ in “bon” or Polish &#x27;ą&#x27; in “kąt”). This is also suggested by the appearance of each as a &#x27;stacked&#x27; digraph of &#x27;Am&#x27; and &#x27;om&#x27; respectively.

The names of the letters do not imply capitalization, as both little and big yus exist in majuscule and minuscule variants.

== Usage and disappearance ==

All modern Slavic languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet have lost the nasal vowels (at least in their standard varieties), making yus unnecessary.

=== In Bulgarian and Macedonian ===
Big yus was a part of the Bulgarian alphabet until 1945. However, by then, in the eastern dialects, the back nasal was pronounced the same way as ъ . Since the new Soviet-sponsored regime wanted to break with the one which it replaced at the end of WWII and closer align the official language with Russian, which was closer to the eastern dialects and had already removed its Big Yus, the western pronunciations were deemed unliterary, and the letter was gone.

There were some Bulgarian and Macedonian dialects spoken around Thessaloniki and Kastoria in northern Greece (Kostur dialect, Solun dialect) that still preserve a nasal pronunciation e.g. (; &quot;Where are you going, dear child?&quot;), which could be spelled pre-reform as &quot;&quot; with big and little yus.

On a visit to Razlog, in Bulgaria&#x27;s Pirin Macedonia, in 1955, the Russian dialectologist Samuil Bernstein noticed that the nasal pronunciation of words like (hand), (child) could still be heard from some of the older women of the village. To the younger people, the pronunciation was completely alien; they would think that the old ladies were speaking Modern Greek.

=== In Russian ===
In Russia, the little yus came to be pronounced as an iotated () in the middle or at the end of a word and therefore came to represent that sound also elsewhere; the modern letter is an adaptation of its cursive form of the 17th century, enshrined by the typographical reform of 1708. (That is also why in Russian often corresponds to nasalized &#x27; in Polish; cf. Russian ; Polish &#x27;.)

=== In Polish ===
In Polish, which is a Slavic language written in the Latin alphabet, the letter &quot;Ę ę&quot; has the phonetic value of little yus, and &quot;Ą ą&quot; has that of big yus. The iotated forms are written &quot;ię/ję&quot; and &quot;ią/ją&quot;, respectively. However, the phonemes written &quot;ę&quot; and &quot;ą&quot; are not directly descended from those represented by little and big yus but developed after the original nasals merged in Polish and then diverged again. (Kashubian, the closest language to Polish, uses the letter &quot;ã&quot; instead of &quot;ę&quot;.)

=== In Romanian ===
Little and big yuses can also be found in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, used until 1862. Little yus was used for and big yus for unknown vowels, transcribed in later Romanian as and . Now Romanian uses the Latin alphabet and is written Îî or Ââ. is written as Ăă.

One of the first transcriptions of the big yus as î in Romanian is found in Samuel Klain, Acathist, Sibii, 1801.

=== In Slovak ===
Little yus in the Slovak alphabet has been substituted by &quot;a&quot; (&quot;desať&quot;, &quot;načať&quot;), &quot;e&quot; (&quot;plesať&quot;), iotated &quot;ia&quot; (&quot;žiadať&quot;, &quot;kliatba&quot;, &quot;mesiac&quot;), &quot;ie&quot; (&quot;bdieť&quot;) and &quot;ä&quot; in several cases (&quot;pamäť&quot;, &quot;päť&quot;, &quot;svätý&quot;). Big yus is transliterated and pronounced as &quot;u&quot;, or accented &quot;ú&quot; (&quot;budeš&quot;, &quot;muž&quot;, &quot;mučeník&quot;, &quot;ruka&quot;, &quot;navyknúť&quot;, &quot;pristúpiť&quot;, &quot;púť&quot;, &quot;usnúť&quot;). Iotated, and closed iotated form of little yus occur as &quot;ja&quot; (e.g. &quot;jazyk&quot;, &quot;svoja&quot;, &quot;javiť&quot;, &quot;jasle&quot;).

=== In Ruthenian ===
In Ruthenian language, little yus was used to transcribe the sound &quot;ja&quot; (as in руска(ѧ) мова (&quot;Ruthenian language&quot;) or ѧзыкъ (&quot;language&quot;)). This evolved into and corresponded with the letter я in the descendant languages of Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Rusyn.

=== In Interslavic ===

The Interslavic language, a zonal, constructed, semi-artificial language based on Proto-Slavic and Old Church Slavonic modified based on the commonalities between living Slavic languages, allows (though does not encourage it for intelligibility purposes) to use both the little and big yus when writing in the scientific variety of its Cyrillic script. The letters correspond directly to their etymological values from Proto-Slavic, but do not retain the nasal pronunciation, instead going for one aiming to convey the &quot;middle-ground&quot; sounds found in etymologically corresponding letters in living Slavic languages. The little yus corresponds to the Latin letter &quot;ę&quot;, while the big yus to &quot;ų&quot; in the etymological Latin script.

The iotated versions are not part of the standard scientific vocabulary, where the yuses are instead accompanied by the Cyrillic letter &quot;ј&quot;, also used in the modern Serbian and Macedonian alphabets, though their use is optionally permissible for aesthetic reasons if one opts for using the more standard iotated vowels in their writing, so that consistency is preserved.

As of May 2019, no official &quot;scientific Cyrillic&quot; is endorsed by the Interslavic Commission for the reason that while Latin is easier to modify by simply adding diacritics, Cyrillic requires completely distinct graphemes. That is very likely to significantly hamper intelligibility for first-time readers, so yuses should not be used in writing when aiming to convey an easily understandable message.

<text>Dahod is a city on the banks of the Dudhimati River in Dahod District in the State of Gujarat, India. It is said that it has taken its name from Saint Dadhichi, who had an Ashram on the bank of Dudhumati river. This city is known for being the birthplace of 6th Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, son of 5th Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The city serves as District Headquarters for Dahod District. It is from Ahmedabad and from Vadodara. It is also known as &quot;Dohad&quot; (meaning &quot;two boundaries&quot;, as the borders of the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are nearby).

Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was born in Dahod in 1618, during the reign of Jahangir. Aurangzeb was said to have ordered his ministers to favour this town, as it was his birthplace. Tatya Tope, the freedom fighter, is known to have absconded in Dahod. He is believed to have lived his last days in this region.

It was previously within the boundaries of Panchmahal District. However, in 2006, Dahod was recognized as a separate district. Urban Bank Hospital is situated here. The foundation stone for a dental college was laid by the trust of philanthropist Girdharlal Sheth.

The railway colony, also known as Parel area of Dahod was built by the British and it still follows the same architecture. There is also a western railway locomotive workshop here, and this area contributes to population of mostly people from other states, working here in railways workshop. Dahod is taking step into digital era also.
Iskcon Dahod also functions here for the welfare of society by providing them cultural and valuebased education, youth program.

<text>Becta, originally known as the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, was a non-departmental public body (popularly known as a Quango) funded by the Department for Education and its predecessor departments, in the United Kingdom. It was a charity and a company limited by guarantee. The abolition of Becta was announced in the May 2010 post-election spending review. Government funding was discontinued in March 2011. Becta went into liquidation in April 2011.

==Role==
Becta was the lead agency in the United Kingdom for the promotion and integration of information and communications technology (ICT) in education. Becta was a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. It was established in 1998 through the reconstitution of the National Council for Educational Technology (NCET), which oversaw the procurement of all ICT equipment and e-learning strategy for schools.

== Policy ==
Foremost among the 2005–2008 Becta strategic objectives were &quot;to influence strategic direction and development of national education policy to best take advantage of technology&quot; and &quot;to develop a national digital infrastructure and resources strategy leading to greater national coherence.&quot;

==National Grid for Learning==
The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) was managed by Becta and was set up as a gateway to educational resources to support schools and colleges across the UK. The NGfL portal was launched in November 1998, as one of several new programmes initiated by the new Labour government which took office in May 1997 and had a linked budget of earmarked funds to be spent on schools&#x27; internet connections and ICT.

==Purchasing Frameworks==
Becta awarded certain vendors placement on approved &quot;purchasing frameworks&quot;: 
The purchasing frameworks were criticised as being outdated, and for effectively denying schools the option of benefiting from both free and open source and the value and experience of small and medium ICT companies. Participating companies had to have a net worth of at least £700,000 to qualify and had to satisfy a list of functional requirements. A concern was raised about the &quot;over-comfortable relationship the government has with some of the bigger players.&quot;

In January 2007, Crispin Weston, who had helped Becta draw up the criteria used to select suppliers, asked the EC Competition Commission to investigate his allegation that a significant number of the successful tenders had failed to implement the mandatory functional requirements, including particular aspects of inter-operability. He also added in his letter to the Commission that they should take action on the further issue of:

<doc id="766514" wikidata="Q837402" url="?curid=766514" title="Australian wood duck">
<text>The Australian wood duck, maned duck or maned goose (Chenonetta jubata) is a dabbling duck found throughout much of Australia. It is the only living species in the genus &quot;Chenonetta&quot;. Traditionally placed in the subfamily Anatinae (dabbling ducks), it might belong to the subfamily Tadorninae (shelducks); the ringed teal may be its closest living relative.

==Taxonomy==
The Australian wood duck was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Anas jubata&quot;.

The flightless New Zealand species &quot;Chenonetta finschi&quot; (Finsch&#x27;s duck) which was formerly believed to constitute a monotypic genus (&quot;Euryanas&quot;) has been determined to belong to &quot;Chenonetta&quot;. It became extinct before scientists could properly survey the New Zealand avifauna, but possibly as late as 1870 (based on a report of a flightless goose caught in Ōpōtiki.)

===Etymology===
&quot;Chenonetta&quot;: &quot;khēn&quot;, χηνος &quot;khēnos&quot; &quot;goose&quot;; νηττα &quot;nētta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;.
&quot;jubata&quot;: &quot;maned, crested&quot;, from &quot;iuba&quot; &quot;mane, crest&quot;

==Description==
This 45–51 cm duck looks like a small goose, and mostly feeds by grazing in flocks.

The male is grey with a dark brown head, mottled breast and very thin white and black stripes on sides/flanks. The female has white stripes above and below the eye and mottled underparts. Both sexes have grey wings with black primaries and a white speculum. Juveniles are similar to adult females, but lighter and with a more streaky breast.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian wood duck is widespread in Australia, including Tasmania. The Australian wood duck is found in grasslands, open woodlands, wetlands, flooded pastures and along the coast in inlets and bays. It is also common on farmland with dams, as well as around rice fields, sewage ponds and in urban parks. It will often be found around deeper lakes that may be unsuitable for other waterbirds&#x27; foraging, as it prefers to forage on land. It has been recorded as a vagrant in New Zealand, although in 2015 and 2016 a pair successfully bred there.

==Behaviour==

===Call===
The most common call is a loud, rising croaky &quot;gnow&quot; sound by the females, and the male call is the same except smoother, shorter and higher than the females. Staccato chattering is also present in flocks.

===Protection===
Australian wood duck is widespread in its geographic range and can be observed in a range of environments. This species has benefited from agriculture and urban developments due to the abundance of fresh water sources. In comparison to other species of Australian ducks, the Australian Wood Duck is very common in urban areas, especially near permanent water sources such as dams, ponds, pools and irrigated grass areas such as sporting facilities, urban parks and residential nature strips.

The Australian Wood Duck is classified as a game bird in states and territories where recreational hunting is permitted and with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory, Australian Wood Duck can be harvested throughout its geographic range by licensed hunters in all states and territories either as a pest animal or during declared recreational hunting seasons.

In Western Australia the Australian Wood Duck is a declared pest of agriculture in the South West Land Division of WA under the provisions of Section 35 the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976 and can be legally harvested on private land between the 1st January and the 30th June, in accordance with a restricted open season notice, without the need to obtain a damage licence from the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation.

In New South Wales the Australian Wood Duck along with 9 other species of Australian duck can be harvested under the NSW Native Game Bird Management Program on private property by land owners and recreational hunters who have passed the nationally recognised &#x27;Waterfowl Identification Test&#x27; (WIT) and hold the appropriate New South Wales Game license.

In Queensland Australian Wood Ducks along with other species of waterfowl can be harvested by under the appropriate Damage Mitigation Permit (DMP) for culling and dispersal of wildlife identified as posing a risk of damage to property or agricultural production.

In addition to recreational and mitigation harvesting, Australian Wood Duck (&#x27;Ngawurk&#x27; in the Dja Dja Wurrung language ) and other species of waterfowl can be harvested by traditional owners using traditional and modern methods in all states and territories.

This species is not threatened and due to its environmental adaptability, its numbers are considered to be ascending.

===Reproduction===

Australian wood duck nests in cavities in trees or in nest-boxes above or near water. Nests are made with a pile of down.

===Breeding===
This duck nests in a tree cavity laying 9–11 cream-white eggs, similar to the Mandarin ducks. The female incubates them while the male stands guard. Once the ducklings are ready to leave the nest, the female flies to the ground and the duckling will leap to the ground and follow their parents. The males also secure their ducklings closely along with the females.

==Feeding==
The Australian wood duck eats grasses, grains, clover and other herbs, and occasionally, insects. It is rarely seen on open water, preferring to forage by dabbling in shallow water, or in grasslands and crops.

==Similar species==
The Australian wood duck can be distinguished from pygmy geese, &quot;Nettapus&quot; spp., which are smaller, have bold white face markings and are usually seen on water. Whistling ducks, &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; spp., have longer legs and necks, larger, more duck-like bills and tend to walk more upright. When flying, the Australian wood duck is the only duck with white secondary feathers and dark wingtips.

<doc id="766519" wikidata="Q843103" url="?curid=766519" title="Dickin Medal">
<text>The PDSA Dickin Medal was instituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by Maria Dickin to honour the work of animals in World War II. It is a bronze medallion, bearing the words &quot;For Gallantry&quot; and &quot;We Also Serve&quot; within a laurel wreath, carried on a ribbon of striped green, dark brown, and pale blue. It is awarded to animals that have displayed &quot;conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units&quot;. The award is commonly referred to as &quot;the animals&#x27; Victoria Cross&quot;.

Maria Dickin was the founder of the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), a British veterinary charity. She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Empire armed forces or civil emergency services. The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 – to 32 pigeons, 18 dogs, 3 horses, and a ship&#x27;s cat – to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the Second World War and subsequent conflicts.

The awarding of the medal was revived in 2000. In December 2007, 12 former recipients buried at the PDSA Animal Cemetery in Ilford, Essex, Greater London, were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a National Lottery-aided project to restore the cemetery.

, the Dickin Medal has been awarded 74 times, plus one honorary award made in 2014 to all the animals who served in the First World War.
==Recipients==
The first recipients of the award, in December 1943, were three pigeons serving with the Royal Air Force who contributed to the recovery of aircrews from ditched aircraft. The most recent recipient is Bass, a Belgian Malinois who served with the US Marine Special Operation Command in Afghanistan.



*A ^ Rob was awarded the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 parachute drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so that the dog would remain with the regiment.
*B ^ The German Shepherd Dog breed was renamed in the UK by The Kennel Club in 1919 to &quot;Alsatian Wolf Dog&quot;. During the 1920s, the &quot;Wolf Dog&quot; part of the name fell out of use and dogs of this breed were simply known as &quot;Alsatians&quot;. The name had been reverted in most countries by 1977 to &quot;German Shepherd Dog&quot;.

<text>Barbara Joan Estelle Amiel, Baroness Black of Crossharbour, DSS (born 4 December 1940), is a British-Canadian conservative journalist, writer, and socialite. She is married to former media proprietor Conrad Black.

==Early life and career==
Amiel was born into a Jewish family in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, the daughter of Vera Isserles (née Barnett) and Harold Joffre Amiel. A cousin was the oncologist, broadcaster and humorist Rob Buckman. Her father, originally a solicitor, became a Lieutenant Colonel serving in Italy during World War II, but was discharged because of injury. Her parents divorced when she was eight, after her father left her mother for another woman. Amiel attended North London Collegiate School in Edgware, Greater London, an independent girls&#x27; school.

Amiel&#x27;s mother remarried and, in November 1952, the couple emigrated with Barbara, her sister and half-brother, to Hamilton, Ontario. She never saw her biological father again after her mother remarried. Family difficulties, including a period when her step-father was unemployed, precipitated her living independently for periods of time from the age of 14 during which she gained employment to support herself. &quot;My mother loathed me and saw me as a hindrance to her life&quot;, she told Alice Thomson of &quot;The Times&quot; in 2020. Her natural father took his own life in 1956 after the discovery of theft from his clients. Amiel&#x27;s family decided not to disclose this information; she did not discover the truth for three years. In 1959, she entered the University of Toronto, and took a degree in Philosophy and English. Amiel was then sympathetic to communism, and was a delegate in 1962 to the Soviet-organised World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki, Finland.

In the late 1960s, Amiel was a story editor and, for a brief period, a presenter for CBC TV Public Affairs. In the 1970s she was intermittently on contract with both CTV and TV Ontario and was a regular on the CBC TV&#x27;s midday &quot;Bob McLean Show&quot;. Amiel first joined &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine in 1976 working as a senior writer, associate editor and columnist. &quot;By Persons Unknown: The Strange Death of Christine Demeter&quot; (1977, co-authored with her second husband), won The Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best non-fiction in 1978. She served as the first female editor of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; from 1983 until 1985.

==Marriages==
Amiel has been married four times, with three marriages ending in divorce. She entered a brief marriage to Gary Smith in 1964. Her second marriage was to poet, broadcaster and author George Jonas from 1974 to 1979. Her political orientation switched from left to right during her marriage to Jonas, a process which is described in &quot;Confessions&quot;, her 1980 memoir. A third marriage in 1984 was to cable businessman David Graham, but the couple split around 1988, eventually divorcing in 1990.

The publisher Lord Weidenfeld became Amiel&#x27;s friend and, for a time, her lover. On 21 July 1992, she married Conrad Black, a Canadian businessman with extensive mining and media interests. According to Tom Bower, Black&#x27;s goals in life vastly expanded after his marriage to Amiel. Peter Oborne described them as &quot;London&#x27;s most glamorous power couple&quot; during the 1990s in a 2004 &quot;Spectator&quot; article.

In 2001, Amiel became Lady Black after her husband gained a life peerage as Lord Black of Crossharbour.

==Career in British journalism==
After her return to London, from 1986 to 1999, Amiel was a columnist for &quot;The Times&quot; and, from 1991, a senior political columnist for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In 1995, she moved to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, then owned by Conrad Black&#x27;s company.

In December 2001, she alleged in &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine that coarse and reputedly antisemitic remarks had been uttered by the ambassador of a &quot;major EU country&quot; at a party she hosted. &quot;The Times&quot; of London identified the individual as then-French ambassador to the UK, Daniel Bernard. Amiel said he had described Israel as &quot;that shitty little country&quot;. Bernard, via a spokesman, did not deny making the comment.

Amiel&#x27;s journalism became known, according to Andy McSmith in 2007, for her &quot;ferocious&quot; defence of Israel and as an opponent of the BBC. She wrote in September 2003 that while &quot;it is too late to kill Arafat,&quot; the &quot;conflict in the Middle East is not amenable to a peaceful solution and can only be solved by the total victory of one side&quot; either by &quot;the Arabs annihilating the Israelis or the Israelis being forced to use every means, not excluding nuclear power, to defend themselves.&quot; She was accused in 2002 by Sir Peregrine Worsthorne, former editor of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, of writing &quot;enragingly narrow-minded and logic-choppingly unpersuasive apologies for Israel&quot;. After Amiel lost her &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; column in May 2004, Worsthorne described her, of all Black&#x27;s &quot;neo-conservative columnists&quot;, as the &quot;worst of the lot&quot;.

In a July 2003, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article, she wrote that the BBC had been &quot;a bad joke in its news and public affairs broadcasting for several decades&quot; with its &quot;relentless anti-Israel and anti-America biases&quot;. A few months earlier, in a March 26 &quot;Telegraph&quot; article, she said that the BBC Arabic Service had never analysed the power structures inside Iraq and how it merged into the interests of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s family. The head of the World Service, Mark Byford, said the Arabic Service had covered these issues with &quot;countless interviews and debates&quot;.

In a &quot;Telegraph&quot; article published on 3 March 2003, she compared the BBC&#x27;s Arabic Service to &quot;the controlled press in Arabic dictatorships&quot; who are not allowed to publish any criticisms of their governments.

Amiel was criticized in 2004 by William Dalrymple in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; for writing articles that portray Arabs and Islam in a derogatory manner. In an early 2004 &quot;Telegraph&quot; article, Amiel made claims which greatly overestimated Muslim demographics in France and its potential growth, asserting it was &quot;not impossible&quot; for a majority of the French population to be Muslims by the end of the 2020s. Michèle Tribalat, a demographer at Institut national d&#x27;études démographiques (INED) said the figures Amiel suggested were &quot;une sottise&quot; (&quot;a piece of foolishness&quot;). Nick Cohen, in a January 2002 &quot;New Statesman&quot; article, accused Amiel of being one of the people who believe &quot;objectively the anti-American is pro-Bin Laden&quot;. She had responded to a speech the dramatist Harold Pinter had delivered on 10 September 2001 calling for opposition to American foreign policies. According to Amiel, comments by Pinter on these lines had long &quot;been an incitement to violence. No amount of &quot;bons mots&quot; can quite distance him morally from what took place the next day&quot;, meaning the September 11 attacks.

Duff McDonald in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that &quot;her fiery prose makes Ann Coulter&#x27;s seem tame in comparison&quot;. According to McDonald, Amiel has used her outlets to &quot;defend nonviolent sexual harassment&quot; of the kind Anita Hill said she had endured from (then) Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas, to describe homosexuality as abominable, and to describe as &quot;horrifying&quot; the Princess of Wales&#x27; sympathy for AIDS sufferers.

In 2005, she rejoined &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; as a columnist under its new editor, Kenneth Whyte.

==Hollinger expenses==
In 2002, Amiel gave an interview to &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine which led to an enquiry into Hollinger&#x27;s accounts led by Gordon Paris. Amiel was then Vice-President: Editorial of Hollinger Inc.; her husband was then president and CEO. In her London home, she told &quot;Vogue&quot; her &quot;extravagance knows no bounds&quot;. She displayed &quot;a fur closet, a sweater closet, ... and a closet so crammed with evening gowns that the overflow has to be kept in yet more closets downstairs.&quot; There were a dozen Hermes Birkin bags, at least thirty handbags made by Renaud Pellegrino and over 100 pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes each costing between £250 and £800. Amiel&#x27;s excesses also extended to a large collection of jewellery. &quot;It is always best to have two planes, because however well one plans ahead, one always finds one is on the wrong continent&quot;, she said. &quot;Only a few hundred women in the world can afford to dress like Mrs. Black&quot;, wrote Margaret Wente in a November 2003 issue of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;and Mrs. Black may not be among them.&quot;

After the &quot;Vogue&quot; interview, Hollinger International began legal action in Illinois against the couple and other executives, seeking $1.25 billion in damages. The lifestyle that Lord and Lady Black of Crossharbour enjoyed was charged to Hollinger expenses. A court filing by Hollinger in the Chicago Court at the end of August 2004 said Amiel had been paid $6.7 million in salary, bonuses and fees by the company during the seven years she was vice-president whose indicated tasks were &quot;nothing more than euphemisms for ordinary activities&quot;. Between 1998 and 2003, Amiel served as a columnist at her husband&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and earned $1.3 million for a limited number of articles.

A biography of the couple by Tom Bower, &quot;Conrad and Lady Black: Dancing on the Edge&quot;, was published in November 2006. According to Bower, &quot;Black wanted to appear as a billionaire, and Amiel was an eager accomplice to his desire&quot;. She &quot;could have discovered that her husband&#x27;s income was insufficient to finance their ambitions, but she preferred not to investigate&quot;. Black denounced the book in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; finding &quot;disgusting&quot; Bower&#x27;s &quot;key-hole, smut-mongering side-piece portrayal&quot; of Amiel.

Black filed a suit in Canada against Bower in February 2007, claiming that the biography described Amiel as &quot;grasping, hectoring, slatternly, extravagant, shrill and a harridan&quot;. At the time of Black&#x27;s release from prison in 2012 the case was described as a &quot;$2.5-million suit&quot; and Bower said &quot;How can a convicted fraudster find a jury who will say that his reputation has been damaged by a book that says he&#x27;s a fraudster?&quot;

==Black&#x27;s trial and conviction==
Amiel accompanied Black to his trial in a Chicago courtroom, which lasted for 15 weeks, ending with convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice on 13 July 2007. Lord Black of Crossharbour was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment in December 2007. Amiel was reported to have lost her self control in court early in the trial, and to have spoken in anger to a handful of female journalists who gained her displeasure.

In August 2008, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine published Amiel&#x27;s defence of her husband (also published in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;), in which she portrayed herself as the victim of a gross injustice. &quot;My life was wiped out in Chicago at least all that mattered in it,&quot; she wrote. &quot;What does it matter if one well-off elderly white woman with too many pairs of expensive shoes now finds her social life largely limited to visiting her dearly missed husband in a U.S. federal correctional institution.&quot; Accompanied by his wife, Black had reported to Coleman Correctional Facility in Florida on 3 March 2008 to serve his sentence.

In the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; article, Amiel believed her husband&#x27;s experience demonstrated gross defects in the American judicial system: &quot;If ostensibly privileged defendants like us can be baselessly smeared, wrongfully deprived, falsely accused, shamelessly persecuted, innocently convicted and grotesquely punished, it doesn&#x27;t take much to figure out what happens to the vulnerable, the powerless, the working-class people whose savings have been eaten up trying to defend themselves.&quot; Roy Greenslade wrote that Amiel misrepresented the case of the prosecution in her &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article and, like her husband, was in denial.

Black was released from Florida Penitentiary, in the United States on 4 May 2012. He received a full pardon from President Donald Trump in May 2019.

Amiel&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Friends and Enemies: A Memoir&quot;, was published in October 2020. Of those who severed contact with her after her husband lost control of Hollinger, she comments: &quot;the only revenge would be to see our persecutors guillotined. I have worked out 1,001 ways to see them die, beginning with injecting them with the ebola virus and watching.&quot; Sarah Sands, in a review for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, describes it as &quot;more of an operatic reckoning&quot; than a memoir. Amiel &quot;pre-empts criticism. Is she a femme fatale? Of course she is.&quot;

<doc id="766523" wikidata="Q757271" url="?curid=766523" title="Pacific black duck">
<text>The Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa), commonly known as the PBD, is a dabbling duck found in much of Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and many islands in the southwestern Pacific, reaching to the Caroline Islands in the north and French Polynesia in the east. It is usually called the grey duck in New Zealand, where it is also known by its Māori name, .

==Taxonomy==

The Pacific black duck was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas superciliosa&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Supercilious duck&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the duck by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. His picture was drawn at Dusky Sound, a fiord on the southwest corner of New Zealand. This picture is the holotype for the species and is now held by the Natural History Museum in London. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet &quot;superciliosa&quot; is from Latin meaning &quot;supercilious&quot; or &quot;eye-browed&quot;, a reference to the prominent supercilium or eye-stripe.

Two subspecies are now recognised:
* &quot;A. s. pelewensis&quot; Hartlaub &amp; Finsch, 1872 – island black duck, breeds on the southwest Pacific islands and northern New Guinea
* &quot;A. s. superciliosa&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 − Australasian duck, breeds in Indonesia, southern New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, where it is known as the grey duck or pārera.

A third subspecies, &quot;rogersi&quot; from Australia, has sometimes been recognised but it not distinguishable either genetically or phenotypically from the nominate race.

==Description==
This sociable duck is found in a variety of wetland habitats, and its nesting habits are much like those of the mallard, which is encroaching on its range in New Zealand. It feeds by upending, like other &quot;Anas&quot; ducks.

It has a dark body, and a paler head with a dark crown and facial stripes. In flight, it shows a green speculum and pale underwing. All plumages are similar. The size range is 54–61 cm; males tend to be larger than females, and some island forms are smaller and darker than the main populations. It is not resident on the Marianas islands, but sometimes occurs there during migration. The now-extinct Mariana mallard was probably originally derived from hybrids between this species and the mallard, which came to the islands during migration and settled there.

Like its relatives the mallard and American black duck, the Pacific black duck is one of a number of duck species that can quack, with the female producing a sequence of raucous, rapid quacking which decreases in volume.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The nest is usually placed in a hole in a tree, but sometimes an old nest of a corvid is used and occasionally the nest will be placed on the ground. The clutch of 8–10 pale cream eggs is incubated only by the female. The eggs hatch after 26–32 days. The precocial downy ducklings leave the nest site when dry and are cared for by the female. They can fly when around 58 days of age.

===Feeding===
The Pacific black duck is mainly vegetarian, feeding on seeds of aquatic plants. This diet is supplemented with small crustaceans, molluscs and aquatic insects. Food is obtained by &#x27;dabbling&#x27;, where the bird plunges its head and neck underwater and upends, raising its rear end vertically out of the water. Occasionally, food is sought on land in damp grassy areas.

==Conservation status==
The Pacific black duck has declined sharply in numbers in New Zealand and several Australian islands due to competition from and hybridisation with the introduced mallard. Rhymer &quot;et al.&quot; (1994) say their data &quot;points to the eventual loss of identity of the grey duck as a separate species in New Zealand, and the subsequent dominance of a hybrid swarm akin to the Mariana Mallard.&quot; Studies of their three species of parasitic feather lice support this prediction. This same impact is occurring in many areas of Australia, Tasmania and Adelaide in particular.

It was assumed that far more mallard drakes mate with grey duck females than vice versa based on the fact that most hybrids show a mallard-type plumage, but this is not correct; it appears that the mallard phenotype is dominant, and that the degree to which species contributed to a hybrid&#x27;s ancestry cannot be determined from the plumage. The main reasons for displacement of the grey duck seem to be physical dominance of the larger mallards, combined with a marked population decline of the grey duck due to overhunting in the mid-20th century.

<text>[[Corporate governance of information technology|Information technology]] ([[Corporate governance of information technology|IT]]) governance is a subset discipline of corporate governance, focused on information technology (IT) and its performance and risk management. The interest in IT governance is due to the ongoing need within organizations to focus value creation efforts on an organization&#x27;s strategic objectives and to better manage the performance of those responsible for creating this value in the best interest of all stakeholders. It has evolved from The Principles of Scientific Management, Total Quality Management and ISO 9001 Quality Management System.

Historically, board-level executives deferred key IT decisions to the company&#x27;s IT management and business leaders. Short-term goals of those responsible for managing IT can conflict with the best interests of other stakeholders unless proper oversight is established. IT governance systematically involves everyone: board members, executive management, staff, customers, communities, investors and regulators. An IT Governance framework is used to identify, establish and link the mechanisms to oversee the use of information and related technology to create value and manage the risks associated with using information technology.

Various definitions of IT governance exist. While in the business world the focus has been on managing performance and creating value, in the academic world the focus has been on &quot;specifying the decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT.&quot;

The IT Governance Institute&#x27;s definition is: &quot;... leadership, organizational structures and processes to ensure that the organisation&#x27;s IT sustains and extends the organisation&#x27;s strategies and objectives.&quot;

AS8015, the Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), defines Corporate Governance of ICT as &quot;The system by which the current and future use of ICT is directed and controlled. It involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organisation and monitoring this use to achieve plans. It includes the strategy and policies for using ICT within an organisation.&quot;

==Background==
The discipline of information technology governance first emerged in 1993 as a derivative of corporate governance and deals primarily with the connection between an organisation&#x27;s strategic objectives, business goals and IT management within an organization. It highlights the importance of value creation and accountability for the use of information and related technology and establishes the responsibility of the governing body, rather than the chief information officer or business management.
The primary goals for information and technology (IT) governance are to (1) assure that the use of information and technology generates business value, (2) oversee management&#x27;s performance and (3) mitigate the risks associated with using information and technology. This can be done through board-level direction, implementing an organizational structure with well-defined accountability for decisions that impact on the successful achievement of strategic objectives and institutionalizing good practices through organizing activities in processes with clearly defined process outcomes that can be linked to the organisation&#x27;s strategic objectives.

Following corporate governance failures in the 1980s, a number of countries established codes of corporate governance in the early 1990s:
* Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (USA)
* Cadbury Report (UK)
* King Report (South Africa).

As a result of these corporate governance efforts to better govern the leverage of corporate resources, specific attention was given to the role of information and the underpinning technology to support good corporate governance. It was soon recognized that information technology was not only an enabler of corporate governance, but as a resource, it was also a value creator that was in need of better governance.

In Australia, the AS8015 Corporate Governance of ICT was published in January 2005. It was fast-track adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008.

IT governance process enforces a direct link of IT resources &amp; processes to enterprise goals in line of strategy. There is a strong correlation between maturity curve of IT governance and overall effectiveness of IT.

==Problems==
IT governance is often confused with IT management, compliance and IT controls. The problem is increased by terms such as &quot;governance, risk and compliance (GRC)&quot; that establish a link between governance and compliance. The primary focus of IT governance is the stewardship of IT resources on behalf of various stakeholders whose ranking is established by the organisation&#x27;s governing body. A simple way to explain IT governance is: &quot;what&quot; is to be achieved from the leveraging of IT resources. While IT management is about &quot;planning, organizing, directing and controlling the use of IT resources&quot; (that is, the &quot;how&quot;), IT governance is about creating value for the stakeholders based on the direction given by those who govern. ISO 38500 has helped clarify IT governance by describing a model to be used by company directors.

While directors are responsible for this stewardship it is not unusual to delegate this responsibility to management (business and IT) who are expected to develop the necessary capability to deliver the performance expected. Whilst managing risk and ensuring compliance are essential components of good governance, the primary focus is on delivering value and managing performance (i.e. &quot;Governance, Value delivery and Performance management&quot; (GVP)).

Despite the efforts to manage performance and create value, a study focused on fraud in the UAE demonstrated that corporate governance does not play a major role in reducing fraud, indicating that there is no significant difference in comparison to other traditional techniques for fraud prevention. Researchers have contended that due to this lack of contributions, there should be better oversight from senior management.

==Frameworks==
There are quite a few supporting references that may be useful guides to the implementation of information and technology (IT) governance. Some of them are:
* AS8015-2005 Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology. AS8015 was adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008
* ISO/IEC 38500:2015 Corporate governance of information technology, (very closely based on AS8015-2005) provides a framework for effective governance of IT to assist those at the highest level of organizations to understand and fulfill their legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations in respect of their organizations’ use of IT. ISO/IEC 38500 is applicable to organizations from all sizes, including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit organizations. This standard provides guiding principles for directors of organizations on the effective, efficient, and acceptable use of Information Technology (IT) within their organizations.
*COBIT is regarded as the world&#x27;s leading IT governance and control framework. COBIT provides a reference model of 37 IT processes typically found in an organization. Each process is defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process activities, process objectives, performance measures and a maturity model. ISACA published COBIT2019 in 2019 as a &quot;business framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT&quot;. COBIT2019 consolidates replaces COBIT 5, which itself replaced COBIT 4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with TOGAF and ITIL.
*IGPMM- The Information Governance Process Maturity Model depends on maturing 22 processes that help identify – and improve the management of – information value, cost and risk. CGOC updated the IGPMM in March 2017. The processes reflect the needs of the key information stakeholders, including legal, records information management (RIM), privacy and security, lines of business and IT. The maturation for each business process moves through four stages:
** Stage 1: Ad hoc and inconsistent
** Stage 2: Siloed and manual
** Stage 3: Siloed, consistent and instrumented
** Stage 4: Integrated, instrumented and optimized

Other frameworks offer a partial view on IT Management &amp; IT Governance Processes:
* CMM - The Capability Maturity Model: focus on software engineering
* ITIL - Focus on IT Service management
* ISO/IEC 20000 - Focus on IT Service management
* ISO/IEC 27001 - Focus on Information Security Management
*ISO/IEC 27005 - Focus on Information Security Risk Management
* ISO/IEC 29148 and IREB - Focus on Requirement Engineering
* ISO/IEC 29119 and ISTQB - Focus on Software Testing

Non-IT specific frameworks of use include:
* PRINCE2 and PMBOK - Focus on Project Management
* ISO 22301 - Focus on Business Continuity
* The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) - method to assess an organization’s performance in many different areas
* Six Sigma - Focus on quality assurance
* The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) - methodology to align business and IT, resulting in useful projects and effective governance

==Professional certification==
* Certified in the Governance of Enterprise Information Technology (CGEIT) is a certification created in 2007 by ISACA. It is designed for experienced professionals, who can demonstrate 5 or more years experience, serving in a managing or advisory role focused on the governance and control of IT at an enterprise level. It also requires passing a 4-hour test, designed to evaluate an applicant&#x27;s understanding of enterprise IT management. The first examination was held in December 2008.
* COBIT5 Foundation, COBIT5 Assessor and COBIT5 Implementation are certifications created in 2012 by ISACA.

<text>Paavo Heikki Ruotsalainen (; born Påhl Henrik; 9 July 1777 – 27 January 1852) was a Finnish farmer and lay preacher who became the leader of the revivalist Awakening religious movement in Finland.

==Religious views==
Born in Tölvänniemi (now a part of Lapinlahti) as the oldest son of plain farmers, he received his first Bible at age six. At the time of his confirmation he had already read it three times. His preoccupation with the words of the Bible gained him the nickname &quot;foolish Paavo&quot;. When he heard about the lay pastor Jakob Högman in Jyväskylä, he immediately walked the 200 km to Jyväskylä in the winter of 1799. This visit laid the foundation of his religious life.

Jakob Högman was known as an avid reader of a revivalist devotional booklet &quot;Kallis Hunajan Pisara&quot; (&quot;The Choice Drop of Honey&quot;). He gave Ruotsalainen a copy of the book which remained important to Paavo throughout his life. Högman illustrated to Paavo that there was one thing of utmost importance he was missing, so Högman said to Paavo:
==Revivalist movement==

Ruotsalainen became the leader of the revivalist movement called &quot;herännäisyys&quot; (Awakening) in Finland. He traveled around Finland to meet with other members of the movement, most notably pastors Jonas Lagus and Nils Gustav Malmberg in Ostrobothnia.

It is estimated that he traveled 40,000 km altogether, most of it on foot. With the spreading of the movement, both church and state authorities became worried about it. In 1838-39 he was put on trial and fined, yet this could not stop the movement.

==Death==
Ruotsalainen died on 27 January 1852 in Nilsiä, aged 74.

==In culture==
In 1975, Ruotsalainen became the subject of &quot;The Last Temptations&quot; (&quot;Viimeiset kiusaukset&quot; in Finnish), an opera by Joonas Kokkonen, with a recording in the Deutsche Grammophon label. The libretto of the opera was written by Lauri Kokkonen who had earlier written a play with the same title.

<text>Construction site safety is an aspect of construction-related activities concerned with protecting construction site workers and others from death, injury, disease or other health-related risks. Construction is an often hazardous, predominantly land-based activity where site workers may be exposed to various risks, some of which remain unrecognized. Site risks can include working at height, moving machinery (vehicles, cranes, etc.) and materials, power tools and electrical equipment, hazardous substances, plus the effects of excessive noise, dust and vibration. The leading causes of construction site fatalities are falls, electrocutions, crush injuries, and caught-between injuries.

== Overview ==
According to the International Labour Organization, construction has a disproportionately high rate of recorded accidents. In 2019, the ILO said the top causes of occupational fatalities on construction sites were falls, electrocution, crush injuries, and caught-between injuries. Although construction sites face significantly the same hazards, the rate of accidents varies in different regions and countries due to a variety of safety cultures and workers&#x27; behavioral safety.

Construction incurs more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union. In the US in 2019, 1,061, or about 20%, of worker fatalities in private industry occurred in construction. Construction has about 6% of US workers, but 17% of the fatalities - the largest number of fatalities reported for any industry sector.

In the United Kingdom, the construction industry is responsible for 31% of fatalities at work and 10% of major workplace injuries. In South Africa there are 150 fatalities and approximately 400 injuries each year related to construction sites. In Brazil, the incidence rate for all occupational fatalities is 3.6 per 100,000. (Little to no information regarding construction fatalities could be found in Asia, South American, Africa, and the Antarctic.) The chart below contains more countries and the rate of construction site fatalities.
==Hazards==

The leading safety hazards on construction sites include falls, being caught between objects, electrocutions, and being struck by objects. These hazards have caused injuries and deaths on construction sites throughout the world. Failures in hazard identification are often due to limited or improper training and supervision of workers. Areas where there is limited training include tasks in design for safety, safety inspection, and monitoring safety. Failure in any of these areas can result in an increased risk in exposing workers to harm in the construction environment.

Falls are the leading cause of injury in the construction industry, in particularly for elder and untrained construction workers. Several countries have regulations and guidelines for fall protections to prevent injuries and deaths. In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Handbook (29 CFR) states that fall protection is needed in areas including but not limited to ramps, runways, and other walkways; excavations; hoist areas; holes; form-work; leading edge work; unprotected sides and edges; overhand bricklaying and related work; roofing; precast erection; wall openings; floor openings such as holes; residential construction; and other walking/working surfaces. NIOSH developed a Ladder Safety App which was designed to improve extension and step ladder safety — a concern for those working in construction or any other task that requires ladder use.

Motor vehicle crashes are another major safety hazard on construction sites. It is important to be cautious while operating motor vehicles or equipment on the site. A motor vehicle should have a service brake system, emergency brake system, and a parking brake system. All vehicles must be equipped with an audible warning system if the operator chooses to use it. Vehicles must have windows and doors, power windshield wipers, and a clear view of site from the rear window. All employees should be properly trained before using motor vehicles and equipment.

Employees on construction sites also need to be aware of dangers on the ground. Cables running across roadways were often seen until cable ramp equipment was invented to protect hoses and other equipment which had to be laid out. Another common hazard that workers may face is overexposure to heat and humidity in the environment. Overexertion in this type of weather can lead to serious heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and heat cramps.

Noise is also an occupational hazard, a 2019 study found that construction sites had the highest noise levels when compared to several other industries. Other hazards found on construction site include asbestos, solvents, noise, and manual handling activities.

=== Infectious diseases ===
According to BLS data, about 1 out of 12 construction workers are exposed to infectious diseases more than once a month. This could happen because, in general, many employees continue to work while sick. Scientists studying this topic have reviewed many studies and found that the percentage of people who report going to work while sick ranges from more than a third to nearly 100%. An estimated 8 million employees in the U.S. worked while infected during the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, which likely caused infection of up to 7 million co-workers.

Infectious diseases that occur among construction workers include valley fever (in the southwestern U.S., including California), histoplasmosis (especially in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys), silico-tuberculosis, and tetanus.

Exposures from certain construction activities have been associated with an increased risk of death from infectious disease. A Swedish study of more than 300,000 male construction workers found increased mortality from pneumonia infection among workers exposed to inorganic dust, such as man-made mineral fibers, dust from cement, concrete, and quartz.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) plans should be considered as an important component of all construction site occupational safety and health plans. IPC guidelines are most successful with clear communication and mandatory training.

==== COVID-19 among construction workers ====
In 2019, nearly 60% of the construction work force had at least one COVID-19 risk factor (age 65+, medical condition, or others) for higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. About 1.4 million or 12.3% of construction workers were age 60 or older. One in five (19.7%) construction workers had a respiratory disease, and one in four (25.8%) had cancer, diabetes, or heart, kidney, or liver disease. About 30% of construction workers were Hispanic who make up 17.7% of workers in all industries. The Center for Construction Research and Training (CPWR) has developed a COVID-19 Construction Clearinghouse with a vast array of COVID-19 resources, developed specifically for the construction industry. Additional resources can be found at the bottom of this page and workplace hazard controls for COVID-19. Construction sites should implement safety measures to prevent the spread of infection. Industry-specific guidance documents for COVID-19 have been developed by various governmental and professional organizations. The CDC provides COVID-19 guidelines for construction workers. The CDC provides the following recommendations for the worksite which are applicable to several infectious diseases: Limit close contact with others by maintaining a distance of six feet or wearing cloth face covering when this is difficult. Limit tool sharing. Clean and disinfect surfaces at the beginning and end of your shift and throughout the day. Surfaces that need cleaning include shared tools, machines, vehicles, equipment, handrails, ladders, doorknobs, and portable toilets.

===Road construction===
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created over 12,600 road construction projects, over 10,000 of which were in progress as of 2010. Workers in highway work zones are exposed to a variety of hazards and face risk of injury and death from construction equipment as well as passing motor vehicles. Workers on foot are exposed to passing traffic, often at high speeds, while workers who operate construction vehicles are at risk of injury due to overturn, collision, or being caught in running equipment. Regardless of the task assigned, construction workers work in conditions in poor lighting, poor visibility, inclement weather, congested work areas, high volume traffic and speeds. In 2011, there were a total of 119 fatal occupation fatalities in road construction sites. In 2010 there were 37,476 injuries in work zones; about 20,000 of those were to construction workers. Causes of road work site injuries included being struck by objects, trucks or mobile equipment (35%), falls or slips (20%), overexertion (15%), transportation incidents (12%), and exposure to harmful substances or environments (5%). Causes of fatalities included getting hit by trucks (58%), mobile machinery (22%), and automobiles (13%).

Road construction safety remains a priority among workers. Several states have implemented campaigns addressing construction zone dangers and encouraging motorists to use caution when driving through work zones.

National Work Zone Safety Awareness Week is held yearly. The national event began in 1999 and has gained popularity and media attention each year since. The purpose of the event is to draw national attention to motorist and worker safety issues in work zones.

=== Common chemicals ===
Construction workers exposure to hazardous chemicals on construction sites is common. Hazardous chemicals can be found in many materials construction workers interact with daily life in paints, glues, fuels, dust, and insulation. Many construction sites use cements that contain harmful mineral binders, such as crystalline silica, calcium oxide, and chromium. Many of these chemicals are corrosive if in contact with the skin and damage the lungs if inhaled. Continuous skin contact with wet cement can eventually cause chemical burns. Chromium can cause allergic reactions, such as respiratory allergies, leading to occupational asthma. Exposure to cement dust by eye contact and/or inhalation can also have vast effects on workers&#x27; health leading to lung to term chronic diseases or blindness. Construction site workers can also be exposed to asbestos, most commonly used in heat insulation. The asbestos fibers can cause respiratory and lung problems if inhaled.

Harmful chemicals are also found in paint used by workers on construction sites. Paints contain materials like binders, solvents, and pigments that give the desired color. Resins can be made of many things like polyurethane, epoxy, vinyl acetate, and other similar compounds. Resin is most commonly used to protect materials from corrosion and damage but can also be absorbed through the skin. Solvents are used for binders and varnishes. Solvents are most commonly petroleum-based chemicals mixed with pigment and binders. Constant exposure to solvents by inhalation could increase the risk of chronic illness. A common compound found in solvents is benzene which is widely known to cause leukemia from exposure. Some solvents can also cause hearing loss from their ototoxicity. Pigments might contain heavy metals such as zinc and lead. Lead-based paints are extremely toxic and when exposed to the body can cause many harmful effects. Lead is absorbed into the body when workers inhale lead as dust, fumes, or mist from the paint. Children born to parents who were exposed to excess lead levels are more likely to have birth defects, mental disabilities, or behavioral disorders or to die during the first year of childhood.

PPE for Chemical Protection

The construction industry is responsible for 5-15% of the economy of most countries. Working as a construction worker is one of the most dangerous occupations, with nearly more than 60,000 annual fatalities worldwide. This is why it is not only essential for construction workers to use PPE, but it’s important that they use them properly.

In construction sites, there are many chemical hazards that serve as potential threats to the workers. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is required by law to protect and minimize exposure to these hazards. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires many categories of PPE to meet Hazard Communication Standards. Hazard communication standards provide criteria for hazard classification, chemical labels, safety data sheets, and information on training.

Personal protective equipment like face shields, gloves, respirators, and protective clothing is important in order to protect construction workers from chemical hazard threats like skin absorption, chemical burns, and inhalation of fumes. There have been studies shown that prove that there is a higher prevalence of work-related accidents among construction workers when there is low use of PPE and a lower prevalence of accidents when there is a higher use of PPE.

Studies also show that PPE reduces other health-related risks such as respiratory illnesses and chemical-related conditions in environments with high chemical exposure. (2 peer reviewed). Although it is important for construction workers to wear the proper PPE especially when handling chemical equipment, it is also important that they are properly trained. The Joint Commission emphasizes the importance of proper PPE training. They promote the regular need for audits and assessments of worker compliance and the condition of PPE in order to maintain a safe work environment.

Compliance with OSHA requirements, coupled with appropriate PPE selection and frequent worker training, is essential for lowering the dangers associated with chemical exposure in construction site settings. PPE is not just a critical barrier to danger, but it is also an essential component of a safety culture that protects workers’ long-term health.

== Hazard controls ==
Site preparation aids in preventing injury and death on construction sites. Site preparation includes removing debris, leveling the ground, filling holes, cutting tree roots, and marking gas, water, and electric pipelines. Another prevention method on the construction site is to provide a scaffold that is rigid and sufficient to carry its own weight plus four times the maximum intended load without settling or displacement.

Ways to prevent injuries and improve safety include:

* Management safety
* Integrate safety as a part of the job
* Design a safety management system and setup KPIs
* Apply technology to help overall site monitoring
* Create accountability at all levels
* Take safety into account during the project planning process
* Make sure the contractors are pre-qualified for safety
* Make sure the workers are properly trained in appropriate areas
* Have a fall protection system
* Prevent and address substance abuse to employees
* Review accidents and near misses, as well as regular inspections
* Innovative safety training, e.g. adoption of virtual reality in training
* Replace some of the works by robots (many workers may worry that this will decrease their employment rate)
* Adoption of BIM with three dimensional printing to make the building model first before put into real practice

The employees or employers are responsible for providing fall protection systems and to ensure the use of systems. Fall protection can be provided by guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, positioning device systems, and warning line systems. Making sure that ladders are long enough to safely reach the work area to prevent injury. Stairway, treads, and walkways must be free of dangerous objects, debris and materials. A registered professional engineer should design a protective system for trenches 20 feet deep or greater for safety reasons. To prevent injury with cranes, they should be inspected for any damage. The operator should know the maximum weight of the load that the crane is to lift. All operators should be trained and certified to ensure that they operate forklifts safely.

There are multiple digital tools that can be implemented to monitor over all site safety- including online inductions to construction sites, a digital site log, online construction site safety measurement and digital access control. Digital software keeps all construction inspections in one place and provides a permanent safety record for reporting purposes to help ensure job sites and equipment are safe. 

Operational Excellence Model to improve safety for construction organizations

There are 16 safety drivers associated with this model to improve safety for construction organizations:

# Recognition &amp; Reward
# Employee Engagement
# Subcontractor Management
# Training &amp; Competence
# Risk Awareness, Management &amp; Tolerance
# Learning Organization
# Human Performance
# Transformational Leadership
# Shared Values, Beliefs, and Assumptions
# Strategic Safety Communication
# Just &amp; Fair Practices and Procedures
# Worksite Organization
# Owner&#x27;s Role
# Digital transformation
# Knowledge transfer management
# Automation process

Each safety driver mentioned above has some sub-elements attributed to it.

=== Education and safety ===

Construction workers need to be properly trained and educated on the task or job before working, which will assist in preventing injuries and deaths. There are many methods of training construction workers. One method is coaching construction site foremen to include safety in their daily verbal exchanges with workers to reduce work-related accidents. It is important that the workers use the same language to assure the best communication. In recent years, apart from traditional face to face safety knowledge sharing, mobile apps also make knowledge sharing possible.

Another method is ensuring that all workers know how to properly use electronics, conveyors, skid-steer, trucks, aerial lifts, and other equipment on the construction site. Equipment on the job site must be properly maintained and inspected regularly before and after each shift. The equipment inspection system will help the operator make sure that a machine is mechanically sound and in safe operating conditions. An employee should be assigned to inspect equipment to insure proper safety. Equipment should have lights and reflectors if intended for night use. The glass in the cab of the equipment must be safety glass in some countries. The equipment must be used for its intended task at all times on the job site to insure workers&#x27; safety.

Each construction site should have a construction site manager. This is an occupational health and safety specialist who designs and implements safety regulations to minimize injuries and accidents. He or she also is in charge of conducting daily safety audits and inspections to ensure compliance with government regulations. Most construction site managers have an entry level experience or higher degree.

Before any excavation takes place, the contractor is responsible for notifying all applicable companies that excavation work is being performed. During excavation, the contractor is responsible for providing a safe work environment for employees and pedestrians.

Access and egress are also important parts of excavation safety. Ramps used by equipment must be designed by a person qualified in structural design. No person is allowed to cross underneath or stand underneath any loading or digging equipment. Employees are to remain at a safe distance from all equipment while it is operational. Employees who have training and education in the above areas will benefit their co-workers and themselves on the construction site.

==== OSHA&#x27;s Hazard Communication Standard in Construction Industries ====
Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) refers to laws created by OSHA for the purpose of keeping workers safe by having standards about how information about chemical hazards at jobsites are communicated to workers. This is meant to make sure that employees understand the safety-relevant facts of the chemicals they’re working around, allowing them to take protective measures against any chemical hazards. They were first put into effect in 1983, but at this time did not include the construction industry. Then, in 1987, they were expanded to include every industry where workers are exposed to potentially hazardous chemicals which includes the construction industry. As written in OSHA’s regulations, the HCS of the construction industry are the same as those OSHA set forth generally, even if they are contracted by a company within a company. 

In the hierarchy of hazard controls, Hazard Communication Standards are an example of administrative controls, meaning that they involve work processes that reduce exposure to hazards. A HCS-compliant employer provides factually correct labels on chemical containers, safety data sheets (SDS) on any hazardous chemical present, workplace training involving hazardous chemicals, and a physical, written hazard communication program. These four requirements work in tandem to keep construction employees safer from chemical hazards than they would otherwise be by decreasing their exposure to the chemicals they work with.

==== National Safety Stand Down ====
Every spring in the United States, many safety organizations sponsor a voluntary week-long campaign to raise awareness about falls in construction, the leading cause of death for construction workers. This event provides employers the opportunity to discuss safety hazards such as falls and how to prevent them. Even if a company doesn&#x27;t have employees exposed to fall hazards, the safety awareness campaign can still be used to discuss other job hazards, prevention methods, and company safety policies.

In 2016, falls from elevation caused 92 of the 115 fatalities in the roofing industry as well as 384 of the 991 overall construction fatalities recorded. In 2016, falls from elevation were the leading cause of construction worker deaths in the U.S., fatally injuring more than 310 construction workers seriously injuring another 10,350 by falls from elevation. In 2016, the main causes of these construction related fall fatalities were falls from roofs (124), ladders (104), and scaffolds (60). Eighty one percent of deaths from roofs occur in the construction industry, 57% of deaths from ladders occur in the construction industry, and 86% of deaths from scaffolds occur in the construction industry.

Several of the top 10 most frequently cited OSHA violations every year involve fall-protection safety standards. Annual number of construction fatalities in the United States are listed in the table below:

The program was originally launched as a two-year project on Workers Memorial Day in 2012 to raise awareness about preventing falls in construction, but due to its success, it has been continued at the start of every construction season. In 2015, over 150 public events were held across the country, with over 150,000 workers and 1.5 million US Air Force personnel participating.

Organizations partnering with OSHA to sponsor this annual event include the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Center for Construction Research and Training (CPWR), the American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP), the National Safety Council, and many others. Resources to assist employers in finding activities are also available from multiple sources. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and NIOSH have made several fall-prevention videos available to the public on YouTube, among others. The National Roofing Contractors Association has published three video webinars available for viewing. The Lergent Developers has published a mobile app available for download, which helps workers to find authorized fall prevention course provider.

=== Personal protective equipment ===

Hard hats, steel-toe boots and reflective safety vests are perhaps the most common personal protective equipment worn by construction workers around the world. A risk assessment may deem that other protective equipment is appropriate, such as gloves, goggles, or high-visibility clothing.

=== Company size ===
As the company size increases, the incidence rate drops due to the provision of better occupational health and safety programs.

==Hazards and hazard controls for non-workers==
Many construction sites cannot completely exclude non-workers. Road construction sites must often allow traffic to pass through. This places non-workers at some degree of risk.

Road construction sites are blocked off and traffic is redirected. The sites and vehicles are protected by signs and barricades. However, sometimes even these signs and barricades can be a hazard to vehicle traffic. For example, improperly designed barricades can cause cars that strike them to roll over or even be thrown into the air. Even a simple safety sign can penetrate the windshield or roof of a car if it strikes from certain angles.

The majority of deaths in construction are caused by hazards relating to construction activity. However, many deaths are also caused by non construction activities, such as electrical hazards.

==Construction safety research in academia==
Construction safety has been considered as a hot topic in academic research. As per the latest research. the largest number of published construction safety documents were published by scholars from the US and China; the total number of published articles by these two countries was 1,125, at 56% of the 2000 articles that were published. Both countries showed high levels of research collaboration. While the results suggest that economic development may drive academic construction safety research, there has been an increase in construction safety research conducted by developing countries in recent years, probably due to an improvement in their economic development. While authors’ keywords evidenced the popularity of research on safety management and climate, the network analysis on all keywords, i.e. keywords given by Web of Science and authors, suggest that construction safety research focused on three areas: construction safety management, the relationship between people and construction safety, and the protection and health of workers’ impact on construction safety. There is a new interdisciplinary research trend where construction safety combines with digital technologies, with the largest number involving deep learning. Other trends focus on machine learning, Building Information Modelling, machine learning and visualisation.

==Regulation==

=== European Union ===
In Europe, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work coordinates actions at the EU and national levels and the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion is responsible for regulation at the EU level.

Under European Union Law, there are European Union Directives in place to protect workers, notably Directive 89/391 (the Framework Directive) and Directive 92/57 (the Temporary and Mobile Sites Directive). This legislation is transposed into the Member States and places requirements on employers (and others) to assess and protect workers health and safety.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for standards enforcement, while in Northern Ireland, the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) is responsible. In Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is responsible for standards and enforcement.

===United States===
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets and enforces standards concerning workplace safety and health. Efforts have been made in the first decade of the 21st century to improve safety for both road workers and drivers in construction zones. In 2004, Title 23 Part 630 Subpart J of the Code of Federal Regulations was updated by Congress to include new regulations that direct state agencies to systematically create and adopt comprehensive plans to address safety in road construction zones that receive federal funding.

OSHA implemented the Final Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, which went into effect January 1, 2017. It requires employers to submit incident data electronically to OSHA. This data will enable OSHA to use enforcement and compliance assistance resources more efficiently. The amount of data required varies by company and industry.

According to the latest statistics from OSHA, there are more than 13 job-related deaths each day in the U.S. with one in five of these being in the construction industry.

=== Hong Kong ===
== Health Disparities Among Hispanic Construction Workers in the United States ==
Hispanics make up a sizeable portion of the construction workforce: in 2019, 30.4% of construction workers were Hispanic, compared to 17.7% of workers in all industries. Approximately 1 in 4 US construction workers did not have health insurance in 2018, more than double the uninsured rate among all US workers. Almost half (48%) or 2 in 4 Hispanic construction workers were uninsured, more than triple that of their non-Hispanic counterparts (13%). Compared to their White counterparts, the rate of fatal injuries for Hispanics is 41% higher. In addition, research has found that nearly half of all work-associated fatalities among Hispanics occur in small construction establishments with 1-10 employees. In the period 2003–2008, falling from elevated heights was the main contributor to 40% of all deaths for Hispanic construction workers. In terms of nonfatal injuries experienced by Hispanic workers, contact with objects (43.0%) was the leading cause. Of great concern is that minority workers have a higher risk of suffering from occupational illness and injury. US labor laws that create barriers to organizing a union, immigration policies, unregulated, unsafe work places, lack of health insurance, misclassified workers who lose protections, being an essential worker, not having sick leave, distrust of the healthcare system, language barriers, and the cost of missing work are just some of the possible contributing factors to this health disparity.

==Construction safety informatics and the role of artificial intelligence on construction safety==
Li (2019) proposes that there are three generations of construction safety informatics which are relevant to construction safety enhancement:
#The first generation of construction safety informatics consisted of technologies that relied completely on control by human beings; for example, structural equation modelling requires the work of an analyst.
#The second generation of construction safety informatics included smart features such as the Internet of Things which can send information to human operators, without human intervention — from sensors, etc. Yet, these “smart” tools cannot learn and improve on their own capabilities.
#The third generation of construction safety informatics uses state-of-the-art AI, to mimic human behavior and think, act, learn and improve on its own decision making. All that is required is that the relevant information is fed to these systems, so that they can be ‘taught’.

<text>City Building is a series of historical city-building games developed by Impressions Games, BreakAway Games, Tilted Mill Entertainment (following Impressions&#x27; demise), and published by Sierra Entertainment. The series began in 1992 with &quot;Caesar&quot;, set in the Roman Empire, and consists of twelve games to date, including expansion packs.

In the &quot;City Building&quot; series the player is put in charge of providing goods and services to the populace of their town, ensuring crime is low, and reducing the risk of disease, fire and building collapse. The player must also strike a balance between imports, exports and taxes to keep their town financially strong. The player is also responsible for defending their town against invasion by building a military.

The series covers four ancient civilizations: Roman, Egyptian, Greek and Chinese. Titles released up until 2004 used the same isometric view game engine, although progressively tweaked and modified according to the theme of the game. Subsequent titles use three-dimensional graphics engines.

== Games ==

The series includes:

*Set in the Roman Empire:
**Caesar (1992)
**Caesar II (1995)
**Caesar III (1998)
**Caesar IV (2006)
*Set in ancient Egypt:
**Pharaoh (1999)
***Expansion (2000)
***Remake (2023)
**Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile (2004)

*Set in ancient Greece:
** (2000)
***Expansion (2001)
*Set in ancient China:
** (2002)
*Set in the Middle Ages:
**Medieval Mayor (TBA)

==&quot;Medieval Mayor&quot;==
&quot;Medieval Mayor&quot; was an announced city-building game set in the Middle Ages by Tilted Mill Entertainment for the PC and tablets. Unlike the previous two games by Tilted Mill Entertainment, &quot;Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile&quot; and &quot;Caesar IV&quot;, the game would not use a 3D engine but return to the 2D engine, because Tilted Mill thought &quot;2D works better in terms of players being able to tell what’s going on at a glance&quot;. Walkers would once again be limited by roadblocks instead of the more recent radius-based or pseudo walker systems, and players would focus more on building a few cities to great heights, rather than restart a new city after each mission. There would be no multiplayer, but Tilted Mill was planning integration with social media.

As of October 2013 &quot;Medieval Mayor&quot; was put on hiatus due to funding challenges and other project commitments. In later interviews, Chris Beatrice expressed both his continued desire to eventually make the game and reticence to start development.

<text>Frank Humphrey Sinkler Jennings (19 August 1907 – 24 September 1950) was an English documentary filmmaker and one of the founders of the Mass Observation organisation. Jennings was described by film critic and director Lindsay Anderson in 1954 as &quot;the only real poet that British cinema has yet produced&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in Walberswick, Suffolk, Jennings was the son of Guild Socialists, an architect father and a painter mother. He was educated at the Perse School and later read English at Pembroke College, Cambridge. When not studying, he painted and created advanced stage designs and was the founder-editor of &quot;Experiment&quot; in collaboration with William Empson and Jacob Bronowski.

After graduating with a starred First Class degree in English, Jennings undertook post-graduate research on the poet Thomas Gray, under the supervision of a predominantly absent I. A. Richards, who was teaching abroad. After abandoning what looked like being a successful academic career, Jennings undertook a number of jobs including photographer, painter and theatre designer. He joined the GPO Film Unit, then under John Grierson, in 1934, largely it is thought because Jennings needed the income after the birth of his first daughter, rather than from a strong interest in filmmaking. Relations with his colleagues were difficult; they saw him as something of a &quot;dilettante&quot;, but he did form a friendship with Alberto Cavalcanti.

In 1936, Jennings helped with the organisation of the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition in London, in association with André Breton, Roland Penrose and Herbert Read. It was at about this time that Jennings, along with Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson, helped to found Mass Observation and co-edited with Madge the text &quot;May the Twelfth&quot;, a montage of extracts from observer reports of the 1937 coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth for Mass Observation. A fiftieth-anniversary edition of this text was published in 1987 by Faber.

In 1938, he edited an issue of the &quot;London Bulletin&quot; which included a &quot;collection of texts on the Impact of the Machine&quot; and he used this material to prepare a series of talks to miners in the Swansea Valley while making &quot;The Silent Village&quot; several years later. This prompted him to add more material and he obtained a contract from Routledge to prepare it for publication as a book; he worked on it fitfully and thought it was almost ready just before his death. His daughter, Mary-Louise, asked Charles Madge to assist in finally editing it for publication in 1985 as &quot;Pandaemonium, 1660–1886: The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers&quot;. The book was cited by writer Frank Cottrell Boyce as an influence in the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony, with an early section of the ceremony named after it.

==The war years==
The GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit in 1940, a film-making propaganda arm of the Ministry of Information, and Jennings joined the new organisation.

Jennings only feature-length film, the 70-minute &quot;Fires Were Started&quot; (1943), also known as &quot;I Was A Fireman&quot;, details the work of the Auxiliary Fire Service in London. It blurs the lines between fiction and documentary because the scenes are re-enactments. This film, which uses techniques such as &quot;montage&quot;, is considered one of the classics of the genre.

His films are otherwise shorts, inclusively patriotic in sentiment and very British in their sensibility, such as: &quot;Spare Time&quot; (1939), &quot;London Can Take It!&quot; (1940), &quot;Words for Battle&quot; (1941), &quot;A Diary for Timothy&quot; (with a narration written by E.M. Forster, 1945), &quot;The Dim Little Island&quot; (1948) and &quot;Family Portrait&quot; (his last completed film, which tells of the Festival of Britain, 1950). Co-directed with Stewart McAllister, Jennings&#x27;s best remembered short film is &quot;Listen to Britain&quot; (1942). Excerpts are often seen in other documentaries, especially portions of one of the concerts given by Dame Myra Hess in the National Gallery while its collection was evacuated for safe-keeping.

==Personal life==
Jennings married Cicely Cooper in 1929. The couple had two daughters. He was also associated with the American writer Emily Coleman and the American heiress Peggy Guggenheim in the 1930s. He died in Poros, Greece, in a fall on the cliffs of the Greek island while scouting locations for a film on post-war healthcare in Europe.

==Reputation==

Humphrey Jennings&#x27;s reputation always remained very high among filmmakers, but had faded among others. After 2001 this situation was partly rectified: firstly by the feature-length documentary by Oscar-winning documentary-maker Kevin Macdonald, &quot;Humphrey Jennings: The Man Who Listened to Britain&quot; (made by Figment Films in 2002 for British television&#x27;s Channel 4); and secondly by Kevin Jackson&#x27;s 450-page biography &quot;Humphrey Jennings&quot; (Picador, 2004). In 2003 two of his films, &quot;Listen to Britain&quot; and &quot;Spare Time&quot;, were included in the Tate Britain retrospective, &quot;A Century of Artists&#x27; Film in Britain&quot; which featured the work of over one hundred filmmakers. The Macdonald documentary is included in the Region 2 DVD of &quot;I Was a Fireman&quot; (&quot;Fires Were Started&quot;) released by Film First in 2008. An earlier BBC documentary written and directed by Robert Vas is entitled &quot;Heart of Britain&quot; (1970).

On 14 May 2014, his 1939 film &quot;Spare Time&quot; was one of those chosen to be commemorated in a set of Royal Mail stamps depicting notable GPO Film Unit films.

The edition of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Great Lives&quot;, on 18 December 2018, was devoted to the life of Jennings.

<text>Pierre Frogier (born 16 November 1950, Nouméa, New Caledonia) is a French politician, who was President of the Government of New Caledonia from 2001 to 2004. He has been French senator for New Caledonia since 2011, and was member of the National Assembly of France from 1996 to 2011. He served as President of the Congress of New Caledonia from 1995 to 1997.

He was born in Nouméa.

He was elected President of that collectivity by the territorial Congress (&quot;Congrès du territoire&quot;) on 5 April 2001, reelected in November 2002 when the government collapsed following the resignation of a minister, and left office on 10 June 2004, when a new government was elected after his party, the anti-independence The Rally–UMP, lost parliamentary elections.

When the new government collapsed, Frogier ran for president in elections two weeks later, on 24 June 2004, in which he was defeated, received 4 of the 11 votes in Congress.

He was elected second time as President of the Congress of New Caledonia from 2007 to 2009.

<text>171 Ophelia is a large, dark Themistian asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly on 13 January 1877, and named after Ophelia in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

This asteroid is a member of the Themis family of asteroids that share similar orbital elements. It probably has a primitive composition, similar to that of the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.

A 1979 study of the Algol-like light curve produced by this asteroid concluded that it was possible to model the brightness variation by assuming a binary system with a circular orbit, a period of 13.146 hours, and an inclination of 15° to the line of sight from the Earth. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Leura Observatory in Leura, Australia during 2006 gave a rotation period of 6.6666 ± 0.0002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.50 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This is in agreement with previous studies.

Ophelia is also the name of a moon of Uranus.

<text>172 Baucis is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly on February 5, 1877, and named after a fictional character in the Greek legend of Baucis and Philemon. The adjectival form of the name is &quot;Baucidian.&quot; It is classified as an S-type asteroid based upon its spectrum.

Photometric observations of this asteroid from the southern hemisphere during 2003 gave a light curve that indicated a slow synodic rotation period of 27.417 ± 0.013 hours and a brightness variation of 0.25 in magnitude.

Polarimetric study of this asteroid reveals anomalous properties that suggests the regolith consists of a mixture of low and high albedo material. This may have been caused by fragmentation of an asteroid substrate with the spectral properties of CO3/CV3 carbonaceous chondrites.

<doc id="766561" wikidata="Q214356" url="?curid=766561" title="173 Ino">
<text>173 Ino is a large asteroid and the parent body of the Ino family, located in the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 1 August 1877, by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly at Marseille Observatory in southern France, and named after the queen Ino from Greek mythology. The dark Xk-type asteroid has a rotation period of 6.15 hours.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Ino&quot; is the parent body and namesake of the Ino family (), an asteroid family in the intermediate main belt with nearly 500 known members. The adjectival form of the asteroid name is &quot;Inoan&quot;.

It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,659 days; semi-major axis of 2.74 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Düsseldorf-Bilk Observatory in January 1879, five months after its official discovery observation at Marseilles.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen classification, &quot;Ino&quot; is a common carbonaceous C-type, while in the SMASS classification it is a Xk-subtype that transitions between the X-type and uncommon K-type asteroids.

Multiple photometric studies of this asteroid were performed between 1978 and 2002. The combined data gave an irregular, asymmetrical light curve with a period of 6.163 ± 0.005 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10–0.15 in magnitude. The asteroid is rotating in a retrograde direction.

<doc id="766565" wikidata="Q2475666" url="?curid=766565" title="Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal">
<text>The Iraqi High Tribunal (IHT), formerly the Iraqi Special Tribunal and sometimes referred to as the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, is a body established under Iraqi national law to try Iraqi nationals or residents accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other serious crimes committed between 1968 and 2003. It organized the trial of Saddam Hussein and other members of his Ba&#x27;ath Party regime.

The court was set up by a specific statute issued under the Coalition Provisional Authority and was reaffirmed under the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Interim Government. In 2005 it was renamed after the constitution established that &quot;Special or exceptional courts may not be established.&quot; The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) promulgated by the Iraq Governing Council before the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty preserved and continued the Iraq Special Tribunal Statute in force and effect. 

The court was responsible for the trial of Saddam Hussein, Ali Hassan al-Majid (also known as &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;), former vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan, former deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz and other former senior officials in the deposed Ba&#x27;athist regime.

==Judges==
The tribunal follows the inquisitorial system which is standard in Iraq and uses investigative judges. Trials are heard before a panel of the five trial judges, who conduct hearings, pronounce judgements and impose the sentences, without using a jury. There is also a separate Appeals Chamber, with nine judges, a prosecutions department and an administrative department. The statute of the court allows for international judges to be appointed on the request of the court and approval of the Council of Ministers, but none have yet been appointed. Judges were initially appointed to a five-year term by the Iraqi Governing Council, in consultation with the Iraqi Judicial Council.

For security reasons, the names of the judges were not initially released, but five judges&#x27; identities were subsequently disclosed:
* Rizgar Mohammed Amin, a Kurdish judge, was presiding judge of the Trial Chamber until 23 January 2006 when he quit citing government interference
* Rauf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, the presiding judge of the Trial Chamber from 23 January 2006.
* Said Hameesh, the deputy presiding judge, who was removed from the Tribunal after the De-Baathification Commission found that he was a former member of the Baath Party, which made him ineligible to be a judge.
* Raed al-Juhi (also transliterated as Raid Juhi, Ra&#x27;id Juhi or Raid Juhi Alsaedi), the tribunal&#x27;s Chief Investigative Judge.
* Barwize Mohammed Mahmoud al-Merani, an investigative judge who was fatally shot on 2 March 2006

==Jurisdiction==
The tribunal has jurisdiction over any Iraqi national or resident accused of the following crimes:
* Genocide
* Crimes against humanity
* War crimes
* Manipulating the judiciary
* Squandering national resources
* The use of armed force against an Arab country

These crimes must have been committed:
* After the coup by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr on 17 July 1968 
* Before 1 May 2003 which was after the invasion of Iraq that brought an end to the rule of Saddam Hussein.

==Rights of the accused==

The rights of the accused are set out in the tribunal&#x27;s statute and include the presumption of innocence, equality before the tribunal, a public trial without undue delay, appointing counsel of the defendant&#x27;s own choosing, calling witnesses, and the right to remain silent.

==Penalties==

The tribunal must impose sentences in line with existing Iraqi law, which includes the death penalty. For crimes such as crimes against humanity which have no counterpart in Iraqi law, the statute says the trial chamber should take into consideration the gravity of the offense and sentences issued by international criminal tribunals.

==Investigations==

===Dujail trial===

From October 2005 to 5 November 2006, the tribunal tried eight people who were accused of crimes against humanity in a massacre of 148 Shiites in Dujail. The defendants included:

* Saddam Hussein, former president of Iraq (1937–2006)
* Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Hussein&#x27;s half-brother and former chief of intelligence (1951–2007)
* Taha Yassin Ramadan, former vice-president (1938–2007)
* Awad Hamed al-Bandar, a former chief judge (1945–2007)
* Abdullah Kadhem Roweed Al-Musheikhi (1925–2011)
* Ali Daeem Ali (1940–2015)
* Mohammed Azawi Ali (1943–2011)
* Mizher Abdullah Roweed Al-Musheikhi (1952)

At Saddam Hussein&#x27;s initial arraignment he was also accused of:

On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found guilty of all charges relating to the Dujail massacre and was sentenced to death by hanging. He received an automatic appeal. However, the appeal was rejected and the guilty sentence was upheld. It was ordered that he be executed within 30 days and he was executed by hanging on 30 December 2006.

===Al-Anfal campaign===
The Special Tribunal investigated the crimes of the al-Anfal campaign in 1988 and during the 1991 uprising. The judges issued arrest warrants against these persons for crimes against Kurds in 1988:
*Taher Tawfiq al-Ani
*Hussein Rasheed Mohammed
The judges also issued arrest warrants against these persons for crimes in 1991:
*Barzan Abdul Ghafoor
*Muzahim Sa`ab Al-Hassan

In June 2005 the judges investigated crimes carried out in 1990, ethnic crimes in the city of Kirkuk, and crimes against Faili Kurds, questioning these accused:
*Aead Futaih Khaleefa for the 1990 events and crimes in Kirkuk;
*Muhsen Khedher Abass for the 1990 events;
*Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti for exiling and killing Ufaili Kurds.
*Mohammed Zemam Abd Al-Razaq for ethnic cleansing in Kirkuk;
*Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti for exiling and killing Ufaili Kurds;
*Lateef Nusaif Jassim for ethnic cleansing in Kirkuk.

In late June the judges had investigated Tariq Aziz concerning the events of 1991.

The judges also questioned these persons concerning the use of chemical weapons in the al-Anfal campaign:
*Saber Abd Al-Aziz Aldori
*Sultan Hashim Ahmed
*Ali Hassan al-Majid (1941–2010)

The judges questioned these persons on various events:
*Awad Hamed al-Bandar about religious oppression and crimes in Balad, Iraq;
*Abd Al-Ghany Abd Al- Ghafoor about religious oppression and crimes in Balad, Iraq;
*Mahmood Faizi Al-Hazaa about the Jomaa crime in Al-Emara city in 1999;
*Hashim Hassan Al-Majeed;
*Hassan Azeba Al-Ubaidi.

On 24 June 2007, Ali Hassan al-Majid, Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tay, and Hussein Rashid Mohammed were sentenced to hang for their role in the al-Anfal campaign against the Kurds. Two other former regime officials, Saber Abd Al-Aziz Aldori and Farhan Mutlaq Saleh were sentenced to life in prison. All charges against former governor of Mosul Taher Tawfiq Al-ani were dropped because of insufficient evidence.

Al-Majid would receive three more death sentences for other crimes: one for the 1991 suppression of a Shi&#x27;a uprising along with Abdul-Ghani Abdul Ghafur on 2 December 2008; one for the 1999 crackdown in the assassination of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad al-Sadr on 2 March 2009; and lastly on 17 January 2010 for the gassing of the Kurds in 1988. Afterwards, he was hanged over a week later on 25 January.

==General Director==
The tribunal was initially led by Salem Chalabi a former exile and relative of Ahmed Chalabi. Critics pointed to Salem&#x27;s lack of experience and close ties to Iraqi dissidents, questioning US motives in his appointment. However, as his uncle Ahmed Chalabi fell from US favour in August 2004, warrants were issued for their arrest while they were both out of Iraq. Some saw this as an attempt to remove them from Iraqi politics. On 19 September 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi as saying that he had received Salem&#x27;s resignation.
Speculation immediately started on who would replace Salem; names mentioned include Taleb al-Zubaidi and Naim al-Oukaili. On 4 October 2004, the Iraqi National Council approved the nomination of Judge Ammar al-Bakri, who became the new Administrator of the Special Tribunal – but was ousted in turn. The nine Appellate Judges have selected an eminent Iraqi jurist as president, who is the tribunal&#x27;s leader. Tribunal procedures are governed by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Iraqi Criminal Procedural Code of 1971.

==Controversies==

The Iraqi High Tribunal was widely criticized for its methodical defects and its political dependency on the Iraqi government. One of its controversial acts included the sacking of its presiding judge in September 2006 by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who perceived the judge as biased towards defendants. Human Rights Watch considered the Dujail and Anfal trials to be unfair and stated that many of the charges were &quot;vague&quot;, concluding that the defendants were unable to bring their witnesses due to safety issues within Iraq. Video interactions from witnesses of the defendants were also denied by the court, thus hampering the defendants&#x27; ability to challenge the claims of the prosecutors. The trails were marked by absence of fundamental judicial proceedings, such as the murder of three defense lawyers and ample utilization of anonymous witnesses by the prosecution, whose claims could not be cross analyzed by the defendants. 

Both within and outside Iraq, the trials by the Special Tribunal were dubbed as a &quot;show parade&quot; designed to execute Saddam and deemed as illegitimate by numerous lawyers and human rights organizations. The tribunal itself was widely seen as a body that was influenced by the Bush administration since it was set by the Coalition Provisional Authority led by Paul Bremer, who himself directly reported to the US President. Numerous international lawyers have criticized the United States for playing too great a role in the foundation, financing, and operation of the tribunal. Richard Dicker, the director of International Justice Programme of Human Rights Watch, stated regarding the proceedings of Anfal trial: &quot;The court undercut the accused’s right to present a vigorous defense by allowing the prosecution to rely on vague charges and refusing requests to accommodate defense witnesses.. This includes refusing to hear testimony from defense witnesses abroad via videolink.&quot;

International legal experts argued for Saddam to be tried outside the country as it was believed that he would not receive a fair trial under inexperienced judges who had been long standing enemies of him and his regime. Following the re-introduction of capital punishment in August 2004, the Iraqi interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions, although some of his comments are open to misinterpretation: &quot;As for the execution, that is for the court to decide so long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly.&quot;

One of the judges, Ra’id Juhi, had indicted Moqtada al-Sadr for murder in April 2004, which British journalist Robert Fisk said had precipitated the Iraq spring fighting of 2004. Fisk said that Juhi, a Shia Muslim then 33, had served as a judge under Saddam for a decade, then worked as a translator, and was appointed to the tribunal by Paul Bremer.

== Other legal issues ==

The Iraqi Special Tribunal also contains an official English translation of the Iraqi Criminal and Civil Code, which Paul Bremer decreed would be the operating legal code of Iraq until it is changed or modified by the Iraqi government.

One emerging, critical issue to the mission of the Iraqi High Tribunal is that of women&#x27;s human rights. Women occupy a uniquely vulnerable position in conflict, and the Iraqi High Tribunal is charged with prosecuting gender-based crimes within the Hussein regime. Historically, rape has proven a prolific problem in conflict, and in many Mid-East countries, including Iraq, such phenomena as honor crimes (the killing of rape victims by male family members to restore honor to the family name) inhibited gender justice. The judges of the Iraqi High Tribunal have taken a pioneering interest in gender justice, requesting a training in fall of 2006 on international law tenets that protect women&#x27;s human rights. Attorney Janet Benshoof of the Global Justice Center was among the legal authorities stressing the importance of upholding women&#x27;s rights in future Iraqi High Tribunal decisions. The judges proved very interested in protecting women&#x27;s human rights in their future decisions, and have requested an amicus (friend of the court) brief from concerned attorneys and women&#x27;s civil society organizations regarding future gender jurisprudence.

<text>174 Phaedra is a sizable, rocky main belt asteroid that was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer James Craig Watson on September 2, 1877, and named after Phaedra, the tragic lovelorn queen in Greek mythology.

The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.84 years and an eccentricity of 0.14. Lightcurve data obtained from Phaedra indicates a rather irregular or elongated body. It has a cross-section size of ~35 km. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Shadowbox Observatory in Carmel, Indiana, during 2009 gave a light curve with a period of 4.96 ± 0.01 hours. This is consistent with previous studies in 1977, 1988, and 2008. The asteroid&#x27;s pole of rotation lies just 5–16° away from the plane of the ecliptic.

<doc id="766569" wikidata="Q14206042" url="?curid=766569" title="Porto Santo Island">
<text>Porto Santo Island () is a Portuguese island and municipality northeast of Madeira Island in the North Atlantic Ocean; it is the northernmost and easternmost island of the archipelago of Madeira, located in the Atlantic Ocean west of Europe and Africa.
The municipality of Porto Santo occupies the entire island and small neighbouring islands. It was elevated to city status on 6 August 1996. The sole parish of the municipality is also named Porto Santo. The population in 2011 was 5,483, in an area of 42.59 km2. The main settlement on the island is Vila Baleira.

== History ==
It appears that some knowledge of Atlantic islands, such as Madeira, existed before the discovery and settlement of these lands, as the islands appear on maps as early as 1339. From a portolan dating to 1351, and preserved in Florence, Italy, it would appear that the islands of Madeira had been discovered long before being claimed by the Portuguese expedition of 1418. In &quot;Libro del Conocimiento&quot; (1348–1349), a Castilian monk also identified the location of the islands in their present location, with the names Leiname (modern Italian &quot;legname&quot; with the same meaning as Portuguese &quot;madeira&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;), Diserta and Puerto Santo. Indeed, the move by Portugal to claim the Madeiran islands was probably a response to Spain&#x27;s efforts at the time to claim and subdue the Canary Islands.

However, humans never recorded the discovery of Porto Santo Island or the other Madeira islands until 1418, when Porto Santo was accidentally discovered after captains were storm blown into its sheltered harbor. They were in the service of Infante Henrique of Portugal. João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira had been ordered by King John I to discover new territory west of Africa and had been sent off-course by a storm while making the &quot;volta do mar&quot; westward swing return voyage. The island&#x27;s name &quot;Porto Santo&quot; (en: &quot;Holy Harbour&quot;) was derived from the sailors&#x27; stories of their discovery of a sheltered bay during the tempest, which was interpreted as divine deliverance. The first Portuguese settlers arrived in the 1420s.

Bartolomeu Perestrelo, a member of the team that later explored the Madeira Islands, became the first Captain-donatário of Porto Santo, by royal award in November 1445. It was he who released a female rabbit that had littered on the voyage, with her offspring, which multiplied catastrophically in a xeric island ecosystem that had evolved in isolation and had never known a flightless mammal. The loss of the native flora laid the island slopes open to erosion and colonization by European weeds that accompanied the settlers.

During the first centuries of settlement, life on Porto Santo was harsh, owing to the scarcity of potable water and the depredations of feral rabbits; there were also constant attacks by Barbary Coast pirates and French privateers.

The New World explorer Christopher Columbus married the Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, the daughter of Bartolomeu Perestrelo. For a while they lived on Porto Santo. The home is now a museum.

The island is characterized by two areas: the &quot;accidented&quot; northeast (mountainous, with rocky ledges and cliffs), and a coastal plain in the southwest (that includes a nine-kilometer long white sand beach, giving the island an advantage over neighboring Madeira). The mountainous northeast part of the island, consists of two geomorphological structures that includes: an area of peaks, Pico do Castelo (437 meters), Pico da Juliana (447 meters), Pico da Gandaia (499 meters) and Pico do Facho (517 meters); and between the eastern coast and this area, a series of minor peaks, Pico do Maçarico (285 meters), Pico do Concelho (324 meters) and Pico Branco (450 meters).

The southwest part of the island, although relatively flat, includes a series of elevations 100 meters in height or greater, such as Pico Ana Fereira (283 meters), Pico do Espigão (270 meters) and the Cabeço do Zimbralinho (183 meters). The slope of the western part of the island slopes from 150 meters to the south coast reaching the sandy beaches of Porto Santo. A third system, in the west-northwest, that includes Cabeço da Bárbara Gomes (227 meters) and Cabeço das Canelinhas (176 meters) is distinct from the areas identified. The island is encircled by an oceanic platform between 20 and 37 km2, with a minimum depth of 8 meters (Baixa do Noroeste), and limited by the flanks of a large submarine volcano.

The island&#x27;s submarine activity occurred during the Miocene epoch, producing basaltic eruptions that persisted to the Quaternary period. There were three phases of distinct volcanism, followed by periods of calm associated with sedimentation:

1st Phase - associated with basaltic lava, pyroclastic flows, trachyte domes that were to form Pico do Concelho, Pico do Facho, Pico do Juliana and the Ponta da Calheta. This period was followed by a period of marine fossil accumulation, concentrated in the northeast of the island to about 300 meters altitude (around Pico do Juliana, Pico de Ana Ferreira and Ribeira do Moledo);

2nd Phase - this was a period of fissural volcanism that cut across and metamorphosed the older formations, occurring in the early Pliocene period;

3rd Phase - was an intrusive phase, resulting in a number of faults and dikes that cut across the Calcareous fossils. Likely occurring in the Pliocene, it was followed by deposits of layers of detritic and calcareous sediments, that included brownish-red alluvial layers, along the island&#x27;s flanks and beach.

===Climate===
Porto Santo has a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with mild to warm winters and warm to hot summers. The driest months are July and August, and the wettest are November and December.

Unlike mountainous Madeira, which effectively traps rain clouds and the moisture of oceanic currents due to its high orography, the comparatively low profile of Porto Santo results in a dry climate. Despite this lack of precipitation, humidity remains high, averaging 77% year-round. The sunniest months are August and September.

===Human geography===

The main urban area is the city of Vila Baleira (), also known as Porto Santo.

Although a small island, the Porto Santo community has its own schools, health-care centre, police detachments, a gymnasium, churches, several local squares, a Congress Centre, museum, shopping centres, bars, hotels and restaurants.

==Economy==
The main industry on the island of Porto Santo is tourism, which has emerged through hotel construction in the 20th century and is based on the attractions of the beaches and temperate climate.

The island has a golf course that was designed by Spanish golfing champion Seve Ballesteros; Porto Santo Golfe hosted the Madeira Islands Open in 2009, as part of the European Tour. Once the planned second course is completed, Porto Santo Golfe will be the largest course in Madeira: there is currently one 18-hole golf course and one nine-hole course. In addition, Porto Santo&#x27;s Golf Complex includes eight tennis courts and an equestrian centre (Pico Ana Ferreira).

The island has an international airport, with daily flights to Madeira Airport (about a 15-minute flight away). The Porto Santo Airport (PXO) has connections with both domestic (Lisbon, Porto) and (occasionally) international flights (including several charters to England, Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, Belgium, France and Spain). The airport regularly serves as a diversion location for aircraft unable to land at Madeira Airport, due to the latter&#x27;s frequent closures as a result of high winds coupled with its strict meteorological requirements for landing.

== Notable people ==
* Bartolomeu Perestrello (–1457) – Portuguese navigator and explorer who is claimed to have discovered and populated Porto Santo Island from 1419
* Filipa Moniz Perestrelo (–) – Portuguese noblewoman, wife of Christopher Columbus
* Stephen Alencastre (1876–1940) – Roman Catholic bishop, fifth and last Apostolic vicariate of the Hawaiian Islands

<text>175 Andromache is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson on October 1, 1877, and named after Andromache, wife of Hector during the Trojan War. Watson&#x27;s telegram to Europe announcing the discovery became lost, and so notification did not arrive until several weeks later. As a result, another minor planet, later designated 176 Iduna, was initially assigned the number 175.

The initial orbital elements for 175 Andromache proved unreliable, and it was only in 1893 that an accurate ephemeris was produced. Because the orbital period is fairly close to being double that of the giant planet Jupiter, 175 Andromache initially became of interest in the study of gravitational perturbations.

Based upon its spectrum, this is classified as a C-type asteroid. It has a diameter estimated in the range 101–107 km with a roughly circular shape. The size ratio between the major and minor axes is 1.09 ± 0.09, as determined from the W. M. Keck Observatory. An earlier result published in 2000 gave a larger size ratio of 1.20.

<text>Surrey County Cricket Club (Surrey CCC) is a first-class club in county cricket, one of eighteen in the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Surrey, including areas that now form South London. Teams representing the county are recorded from 1709 onwards; the current club was founded in 1845 and has held first-class status continuously since then. Surrey have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England, including every edition of the County Championship (which began in 1890).

The club&#x27;s home ground is The Oval, in the Kennington area of Lambeth in South London. They have been based there continuously since 1845. The club also has an &#x27;out ground&#x27; at Woodbridge Road, Guildford, where some home games are played each season.

Surrey&#x27;s long history includes three major periods of great success. The club was unofficially proclaimed as &quot;Champion County&quot; seven times during the 1850s; it won the title eight times in nine years from 1887 to 1895 (including the first official County Championship in 1890); and won seven consecutive titles from 1952 to 1958. Surrey won 23 of its 28 county matches in 1955, the most wins by any team in the County Championship and a record which can no longer be beaten (as fewer than 23 matches have been played each season since 1993). Surrey have won the County Championship 22 times outright (and shared once), a number exceeded only by Yorkshire; their most recent championship win was in 2024.

The club&#x27;s badge is the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers, used since 1915, as the Prince of Wales owns the land on which The Oval stands. The club&#x27;s traditional colour is chocolate brown, with players wearing brown caps and helmets, and the club is sometimes known by the nickname &#x27;Brown Caps&#x27;.

==History==

===Earliest cricket in the county===
Cricket is thought to have evolved from bat and ball games, played by children in southeast England during the Middle Ages. The first written record of the sport is from a witness statement by the Guildford resident and former Royal Grammar School pupil, John Derrick. In 1597 (old style, 1598 modern style), Derrick testified in a court case over the disputed enclosure of wasteland in the town that, as a child, &quot;hee and his fellowes did runne and play there at Creckett and other plaies&quot;. In 1611, King James I gave to his eldest son, Henry, Prince of Wales, the manors of Kennington and Vauxhall, where the home ground of Surrey – The Oval – is today. To this day, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers feature on the club&#x27;s badge.

Cricket became well established in Surrey during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. It is believed that the earliest county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660. The earliest known first-class match in Surrey was Croydon v London at Croydon on 1 July 1707. In 1709, the earliest known inter-county match took place between Kent and Surrey at Dartford Brent with £50 at stake. Surrey would continue to play cricket against other representative teams from that time onwards. Probably its greatest players during the underarm era were the famous bowler Lumpy Stevens and the wicket-keeper/batsman William Yalden, who both belonged to the Chertsey club.

===1845–1864===
Surrey CCC was founded on the evening of 18 August 1845 at the Horns Tavern in Kennington, South London, where around 100 representatives of various cricket clubs in Surrey agreed a motion put by William Denison (the club&#x27;s first secretary) &quot;that a Surrey club be now formed&quot;. A further meeting at the Tavern on 22 October 1845 formally constituted the club, appointed its officers and began enrolling members. A lease on Kennington Oval, a former market garden, had been obtained from the Duchy of Cornwall – which owned the land – by a Mr Houghton, and the ground&#x27;s first game had been during the 1845 season. Mr Houghton was of the old Montpelier Cricket Club, 70 members of which formed the nucleus of the new Surrey County club. The Honourable Fred Ponsonby, later the Earl of Bessborough was appointed as the first vice-president.

Surrey&#x27;s inaugural first-class match was against the MCC at The Oval at the end of May, 1846. The club&#x27;s first inter-county match, against Kent, was held at The Oval the following month and Surrey emerged victorious by ten wickets. However, the club did not do well that year, despite the extra public attractions at The Oval of a Walking Match and a Poultry Show. By the start of the 1847 season the club was £70 in debt and there was a motion to close. Ponsonby proposed that 6 life members be created for a fee of £12 each. His motion was duly passed, and the club survived. The threat of construction on The Oval was also successfully dispelled in 1848 thanks to the intervention of Prince Albert.

In 1855, Surrey secured a new 21-year lease on their home ground and the club went on to enjoy an exceptionally successful decade, being &quot;Champion County&quot; seven times from 1850 to 1859 and again in 1864. In 1857, all nine matches played by the county resulted in victory. This was the time of great players like William Caffyn, Julius Caesar, HH Stephenson and Tom Lockyer, and a fine captain in Frederick Miller. An incident in 1862, at the instigation of Edgar Willsher in a match between Surrey and England, led to the introduction of overarm bowling into cricket.

===1866–1882===
Following a brilliant season in 1864 when the team won eight and drew three of its eleven first-class matches, Surrey went into free-fall in the latter half of the 1860s, owing to the decline of key players Caesar, Stephenson and Mortlock and a puzzling inability to find quality bowlers to support the incomparable James Southerton, whose combination with wicket-keeper Ted Pooley virtually carried the team. Although Southerton broke many bowling records and Harry Jupp developed into the most prolific scorer among professional batsmen, Surrey&#x27;s record in purely county matches during the seventeen seasons from 1866 to 1882 was 59 victories, 107 losses, two ties and 37 drawn games. The team bottomed out in 1871 when they did not win a single county match for the only time until 2008. Southerton, except in 1872 when fast bowler James Street helped him to win seven of twelve games, had no adequate support in bowling after underarm left-arm spinner George Griffith declined, and except when Richard Humphrey achieved prominence in 1872 the batting depended almost entirely on Jupp. The fielding was also generally below the standard expected of first-class cricket.

The appointment of renowned sports administrator Charles Alcock as secretary of the club – a paid position for the first time – in 1872 coincided with an improved performance; however, despite qualification rules being changed so that Southerton played every game for the county (up to 1872 he did not play whenever Sussex, the county of his birth, had a match on) Surrey performed poorly in the 1873 season. As mainstays Jupp and Southerton declined from 1875, matters were ameliorated by the discovery of class amateur batsmen in Bunny Lucas, Walter Read and William Game, but apart from 1877 Surrey never won half as many games as they lost and the inadequacy of the bowling on flat Oval pitches was a severe handicap.

===Dominance in the early years of the Championship (1883–1899)===
In 1880, although the county&#x27;s record remained bad, Surrey began to make the steps that would return them to the top of the table with the appointment of John Shuter as captain and of Walter Read – established as a class batsman but previously available only in August – as assistant secretary. The death of Southerton and retirement of other veterans paved the way for new talent in Maurice Read, William Roller, left-arm spinner Edward Barratt and pace bowler Charles Horner to lay a foundation for long-term success in the middle 1880s. With the rapid rise of George Lohmann in 1885, Surrey challenged for the unofficial title of Champion County for the first time in twenty years; then, by winning 32 of 42 matches in 1887, 1888 and 1889, Surrey were first or equal first in the final three years before official County Champions emerged.

Surrey then won official County Championship titles in 1890–1892 under John Shuter. After a disappointing season in 1893 when their batting failed on Oval pitches rendered fiery by several dry winters and springs, Kingsmill Key took over and led Surrey to further titles in 1894, 1895 and 1899. Leading players in these years were batsman Bobby Abel and a trio of top bowlers: George Lohmann, Bill Lockwood and Tom Richardson. In 1899, Abel&#x27;s unbeaten 357 helped Surrey to a mammoth total of 811 against Somerset; both scores remain club records over 100 years later.

===1900–1939===

The start of the 20th century brought a decline in Surrey&#x27;s fortunes, and they won the title only once during the next fifty years, in 1914. At the request of Surrey&#x27;s captain Lord Dalmeny, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) allowed the use of his feathers on the club badge. The club&#x27;s most famous player was Jack Hobbs, who began playing for the county in 1905, and he had a notable opening partner till 1914 in Tom Hayward, who scored 3,518 runs in all first-class cricket in 1906, equalled C.B. Fry&#x27;s record of 13 centuries in a season and, in one six-day period, scored two centuries at Trent Bridge and two more at Leicester. He scored his hundredth hundred at The Oval in 1913. Between the two World Wars, Surrey often had a good side, but it tended to be stronger in batting than in bowling; Hobbs played until 1934 with another good opening partner in Andrew Sandham. Hobbs scored more runs (61,760) and compiled more centuries (199) in first-class cricket than any other player in the history of the game. In recognition of his contribution to the team, the eponymous Jack Hobbs Gates were inaugurated at The Oval.

The side was not completely bereft of quality in the bowling department, however: Alf Gover took 200 wickets in both 1936 and 1937, a fine achievement for a fast bowler on the flat Oval track. The Oval pitches of this period tended to be very good for batting, and many matches were drawn. The club captain for much of this period was the affable and bohemian Percy Fender, whose closest colleague was the England captain of Bodyline fame (or infamy), Douglas Jardine. In 1938, Surrey played a home match away from The Oval for the first time, at Woodbridge Road in Guildford. After 1939, cricket took a break as the Second World War occupied the nation and The Oval was seized for Government use.

===1945–1958===
From 1948 to 1959, Surrey were the pre-eminent English county team, finishing either first or second in the county championship in 10 seasons out of 12. They finished runners-up in 1948, shared the championship with Lancashire in 1950, won seven consecutive outright titles from 1952 to 1958, and were runners-up again in 1959. Their margins of victory were usually large. For example, Yorkshire were runners-up in 1952 but finished 32 points behind.

Their great success was built on a remarkably strong bowling attack, with Test seamer Alec Bedser supported by the outstanding spin duo of Tony Lock and Jim Laker, the latter widely regarded as one of the finest ever orthodox off-spinners. Lock and Laker made the most of Oval pitches, which were receptive to spin, but the club&#x27;s success was also due to the positive and attacking captaincy of Stuart Surridge, who won the title in all five years of his leadership from 1952 to 1956. The team fielded extremely well and a feature was some brilliant close catching. The team had excellent batsmen, especially the elegant Peter May, and the determined and combative Ken Barrington.

===1959–2004===
A fallow period followed, and over the next forty years to 1998, Surrey won the County Championship only once, in 1971 during the career of England opener John Edrich and under the captaincy of Micky Stewart, but greater success was achieved in the shorter form of the game. In 1969, Surrey employed their very first overseas player: the very popular Pakistani leg break bowler Intikhab Alam. In addition to Intikhab, the Surrey attack in their Championship-winning side possessed four current or future England Test cricketers in Geoff Arnold, Robin Jackman, Bob Willis and Pat Pocock. Edrich was subsequently appointed captain in 1973 and led Surrey to second position in the County Championship in his first year in charge and then secured Surrey their first limited overs silverware the following year with victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Edrich&#x27;s replacement as captain, Roger Knight, led Surrey to NatWest Trophy glory at Lord&#x27;s in 1982. Following Intikhab Alam, other overseas players to appear for the county included the talented New Zealand opening batsman Geoff Howarth and two extremely fearsome fast bowlers, the West Indian Sylvester Clarke and the young Pakistani Waqar Younis.

Following a relative drought of first-class success, and with growing concern over the club&#x27;s internal structure, the club&#x27;s members forced a Special General Meeting in 1995. Following the resultant internal restructuring, a change of fortunes soon followed as new captain Alec Stewart – son of Micky – led the team to the Sunday League title in 1996. This in turn proved to be the catalyst for further success under the captaincy of Adam Hollioake and the influence of Keith Medlycott, who was county coach from 1997 to 2003. County Championship triumphs in 1999, 2000 and 2002 were complemented with Benson and Hedges Cup victories in 1997 and 2001, a National League Division Two title in 2000 and the inaugural Twenty20 Cup in 2003. This was in spite of the death of the highly talented all-rounder Ben Hollioake, Adam Hollioake&#x27;s younger brother, who was involved in a fatal car accident in early 2002. That same year, Ali Brown posted what remained until 2022 a world record List A score of 268 against Glamorgan at The Oval, beating Graeme Pollock&#x27;s former record score in the first of his two one-day double hundreds for Surrey. Adam Hollioake retired after the 2004 season.

===2005–2013===

The run of success came to an end in 2005 when an ageing Surrey team was relegated to Division Two of the Championship, but an immediate recovery took place in 2006 as Surrey won promotion as champions of Division Two. This proved short-lived however, and they were once again relegated to Division Two in 2008, failing to win a single game for the first time since 1871 and losing their last two games by an innings. Despite the end of a successful period, Surrey did post a List A world record score of 496–4 from 50 overs, the first of which was a maiden, against Gloucestershire at The Oval on 29 April 2007; Ali Brown top scored with 176 from just 97 deliveries.

The 2000s saw the retirement of Alec Stewart, Mark Butcher, Graham Thorpe and Martin Bicknell, who all represented England, as well as Saqlain Mushtaq who played for Pakistan. Another England player in Mark Ramprakash had joined Surrey in 2001 and, despite the club&#x27;s travails, became the nineteenth player to pass 15,000 first-class runs for the county, doing so at an average of over 70. Surrey did not threaten to achieve a return to Division One of the County Championship after their relegation, or to win either 40-over competition until 2011. However, the club did have more luck in the Twenty20 Cup following victory in 2003, reaching finals day in 2004, 2005 and 2006, but failing to win the competition. 2011 saw a revival in the team&#x27;s fortunes. They achieved a return to Division One of the County Championship by the margin of a single point, as they won their final four games of the season. They also won the CB40 competition.

After narrowly avoiding relegation in 2012, a season greatly overshadowed by the sad death of talented young batsman Tom Maynard in June, Surrey finished bottom of the Division One table the following year, and the Cricket Manager, Chris Adams, was sacked during the course of the season.

===2014 to present===
Under the new management team of Alec Stewart, appointed director of cricket, and Graham Ford, recruited before the 2014 season to be head coach, they won the Division Two title in 2015 and were also beaten finalists in the Royal London Cup. In January 2016 it was announced that Ford had left to rejoin Sri Lanka as head coach. Michael Di Venuto took over as head coach for the 2016 season and after a poor start, with Surrey bottom of Division One after seven games, the team had a strong finish to the season, finishing in the middle of the Championship and again runners-up in the Royal London Cup.

Gareth Batty stood down as captain at the end of 2017, and the 2018 season under Rory Burns saw Surrey dominate the Championship, winning the title with two matches remaining. Surrey won three consecutive County Championship titles in 2022, 2023, and 2024. This was the first time that a county had won three successive titles since Yorkshire did so in the 1960s. Rory Burns was captain and Alec Stewart was director of cricket for all four wins, and Gareth Batty was head coach for the last three.

== Branding ==
Since the club&#x27;s formation, its official colour has been chocolate brown. Traditionally, and in current first-class matches, Surrey fielders wear a brown cricket cap with their cricket whites, whilst batsmen wear a brown helmet. As a result, the club is occasionally nicknamed the &#x27;Brown Caps&#x27;.

Surrey&#x27;s badge is a brown shield with white Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers and the club name. The feathers were adopted in 1915, when Lord Rosebery (a former Surrey captain) obtained permission to use them from the Prince of Wales, whose Duchy of Cornwall estate is the landlord of The Oval. The feathers on the badge incorporate the number 1845, the year of the club&#x27;s establishment.

Surrey&#x27;s limited overs sides have played under a variety of names. The name Surrey Lions was used prior to 2006 and from 2010 to 2012, whilst from 2006 to 2010 they were the Surrey Brown Caps. They currently simply use the one-word name Surrey. They have also used numerous colours for their limited overs kits, including combinations of black, blue, brown, biege, gold, silver and green. Currently, players wear a predominantly black kit with fluorescent blue decoration for one-day matches, and black trousers with fluorescent blue shirts for T20 games.

== Grounds ==


Since their formation, Surrey have played the overwhelming majority of their home matches at The Oval. The stadium currently holds 25,500 people and is the third largest cricket ground in England, after Lord&#x27;s and Edgbaston. The Oval was first leased by the club in 1845 from the Duchy of Cornwall and it remains so to this day.

The Oval is a long-standing and frequent Test match venue for the England cricket team, traditionally hosting the last Test match of each English summer, in late August or early September.

Surrey play some matches each year at Woodbridge Road, Guildford, which holds 4,500 spectators. This is known as an &#x27;out-ground&#x27; and currently hosts one County Championship match and one List A match each season. All other home matches are played at The Oval.

Surrey have played home matches at fourteen different out-grounds in total. The Oval hosted all but two Surrey home matches between 1846 and 1938. The following table gives details of every venue at which Surrey have hosted men&#x27;s first-class, List A or Twenty20 cricket matches:

==Rivalry with Middlesex==

Surrey contest the London derby with Middlesex, so-called because of the two traditional counties&#x27; proximity to, and overlap with, today&#x27;s Greater London, which was only created in 1965. The match generally draws the biggest crowds of the season for either team. In first-class cricket, Surrey have won more of the 256 London derbies than Middlesex, but the commonest result is the draw, while Middlesex have the slight edge in one-day cricket with 28 wins to Surrey&#x27;s 26. Surrey have won 12 of the 17 Twenty20 London derbies.

==Finances==
Surrey County Cricket Club traditionally has relatively strong finances in terms of the county game (whose 18 counties&#x27; aggregate losses amounted to over £9 million in 2010), which is in no small part due to the capability of and agreement with its principal home ground, The Oval, to stage Test cricket on a yearly basis, alongside limited overs internationals. However, despite its reputation as an aggressively commercial club, this reputation took a hit with the club announcing pre-tax losses of £502,000 for the 2010 financial year, as turnover dropped by 20% to £20.5m. The club had previously benefited from a sunnier balance sheet due to the sale of ground naming rights and the re-development of the Vauxhall End at The Oval.

In the 2008 financial year, a year when the club did not win a single match in the Second Division Championship, Surrey had achieved pre-tax profits of £583,000 with a turnover of approaching £24 million, as membership swelled to 10,113. Record profit and turnover were announced for 2009 thanks to the staging of international cricket matches with the figures growing to £752,000 and £25.5 million, respectively. In 2010, the club was in a state of &quot;financial strife,&quot; with twenty staff fired after lackluster attendance. The club began focusing under new leadership in 2011 on marketing the Oval.

Between 2007 and 2020, the club had a period of &quot;steady revenue growth,&quot; and in 2020, the club was in the process of building a 95-room hotel across the road from the Oval House, to &quot;diversify&quot; its revenue mix. Surrey CCC launched a bond in September 2019 to fund redeveloping the Oval cricket ground. By 2020, its &quot;off-field arm&quot; brought in half the club&#x27;s revenue. The club&#x27;s finance director in March 2020 said a &quot;record-breaking season&quot; at the Kia Oval in 2019 would cushion the club from the financial impact of COVID-19. Events at the venue as well as &quot;wider interest in cricket, resulted in a record year with annual pre-tax profit at around £6m that more than doubled the previous year’s profits and revenue of £40m,&quot; which was 30 per cent higher than 2018.

==Sponsorship==

Surrey&#x27;s current main sponsor is Kia Motors, who paid £3.5m over five years to sponsor the shirts and the ground naming rights for The Oval. Former main sponsors were Brit plc who paid £500,000.00 per year (2004 to 2009) and AMP Limited who paid £250,000 (2002). Since 2023, the kit supplier has been Castore.

Surrey have had 41 club captains since 1846. The club captain leads the team on the field, unless he is on international duty, injured or otherwise unavailable. Surrey&#x27;s most successful County Championship captain is Stuart Surridge, who won the title in each year of his captaincy in a five-year run stretching from 1952 to 1956. The current captain since his appointment in 2018 is Rory Burns. For the 2018 season onwards, the club announced the creation of a separate captain specifically for Twenty20 matches, with experienced bowler Jade Dernbach being appointed to the role.

<text>François Bourgeon (born 5 July 1945, Paris) is a French comics artist. 

==Biography==
Bourgeon was originally educated as a master stained glass artist, but difficulties in finding employment and a passion for drawing altered his course onto a different career. Getting illustrations published in magazines from 1971 eventually led him to pursue graphic storytelling and to develop his craft over the next few years. His first major comic work became the two first outings in the medieval series &#x27;, created for publisher Glénat Editions who released the two titles directly in comic album format. These two titles already foreshadowed his later, more grim medieval epos &#x27; (&quot;The Companions of the Dusk&quot;), both thematically as well as art-wise. When the &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Passengers of the Wind&quot;) series was serialized for which Bourgeon abandoned &quot;Brunelle et Colin&quot; in &quot;Circus&quot; magazine in 1979, likewise published by Glénat, it became recognized as one of the most important European comic series of its era. His graphic novels have ranged from nautical and medieval historical fiction to science fiction, and characteristically, within settings of violence and sexuality, epic stories revolve around strong female characters. Brunelle, Isa, Mariotte and Cyann are the heroines of each their series, &quot;Brunelle et Colin&quot;, &quot;The Passagers of the Wind, The Twilight Companions&quot; and &quot;The Cyann Saga&quot;, respectively. Bourgeon is noted as a thorough researcher and his drawings, from 17th-century ships to 14th-century clothing, have a reputation for historical accuracy. For example, when working on &quot;The Passengers of the Wind&quot;, he did a vast amount of background reading, consulted academic specialists and visited the Maritime Museum in Nantes. For this series he also made scale models both of colonial architectural structures and one of the ships on which the main characters sail, in order to ensure that the dimensions and the interior layouts were correct. The same approach has been used for other works too. In &quot;The Cyann Saga&quot; he built models of the machines and buildings seen in the series, so he could walk around them and see them from different perspectives and light conditions.
His time-consuming and meticulous research has resulted in that his body of work is relatively modest in comparison to the ones created by his major contemporaries such as Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud, Hermann Huppen or André Juillard. He lives in Cornouaille in Brittany.
===The Cyann Saga affair===

When Bourgeon&#x27;s usual editor since 1983, the family-owned company Casterman, was bought by the large corporation Flammarion, problems arose. Bourgeon and Lacroix claimed that Flammarion had altered the sales numbers to slow down royalty payments to the authors, and then committed other irregularities. The authors took Flammarion to court in 1999. Flammarion countersued separately, charging the authors over failure to produce a new album of the Cyann series in less than three years. The contract between the authors and Casterman had never specified a fixed date or time period for producing any album, but despite this, on 30 October 2001 a court decided in favor of Flammarion and ordered the authors to produce an album (the third of the series), with a fine of €1000 per each day&#x27;s delay. On 27 April 2004 an appeals court finally overturned the judgment of the previous court. In the meantime these litigations had become a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in France, because of the intellectual freedom questions and copyright issues they raised in literary circles. In the end, the authors got their liberty and their rights and the third album of the cycle finally came out in 2005, eight years after the previous one, through a different publishing house, Vents d&#x27;Ouest.

==Nature of collaboration with Claude Lacroix==

In an interview in the &quot;Dare-Dare&quot; program of Radio Suisse Romande, as wall as a February 2007 interview on the launch of &quot;Les couleurs de Marcade&quot; installment in the &quot;Cycle de Cyann&quot; series, François Bourgeon revealed the nature of the collaboration between him and Claude Lacroix. For this most recent album as well as the others in the Cyann series Lacroix had the task of creating nearly all of the complex decors, natural or man made be they planets or islands, cities or buildings. In this way he created for Bourgeon the futuristic equivalent of the thorough documentation which had always been the basis for his previous series.

Lacroix, an old friend and collaborator of Bourgeon from times pre-dating those of his other series, created the decors and many of the more important objects of the Cyann series by making sketches and drawings and paintings, and also a few solid three-dimensional models at times. The solid model for the city in &quot;Les couleurs de Marcade&quot; took up several meters of space at Lacroix&#x27;s home. The process for this universe-making was always interactive and non-exclusive. In some instances Bourgeon would choose to make himself some of those background sketches, and he would later show them to Lacroix for his opinion. Regardless of who initiated a sketch or large drawing, the two would exchange comments at all steps as the decor went from early sketch form to finished product within the BD.

<text>176 Iduna is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters on October 14, 1877, in Clinton, New York. It is named after Sällskapet Idun, a club in Stockholm that hosted an astronomical conference; Idun (Iðunn, Iduna) is also a Norse goddess. A G-type asteroid, it has a composition similar to that of the largest main-belt asteroid, 1 Ceres.

An occultation of a star by Iduna was observed from Mexico on January 17, 1998.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Romer Observatory in Aarhus, Denmark during 1996 gave a light curve with a period of 11.289 ± 0.006 hours and a brightness variation of 0.35 in magnitude. A 2008 study at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado gave a period of 11.309 ± 0.005 hours, confirming the 1996 result.

<text>Sidney Dillon Ripley II (September 20, 1913 – March 12, 2001) was an American ornithologist and wildlife conservationist. He served as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for 20 years, from 1964 to 1984, leading the institution through its period of greatest growth and expansion. For his leadership at the Smithsonian, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Ripley was born in New York City, after a brother, Louis, was born in 1906 in Litchfield, Connecticut. His mother was Constance Baillie Rose of Scottish descent while his father was Louis Arthur Dillon Ripley, a wealthy real estate agent who drove around in an 1898 Renault Voiturette. Both his paternal grandparents, Julia and Josiah Dwight Ripley, died before he was born but he was connected to them through Cora Dillon Wyckoff. Great Aunt Cora and her husband, Dr. Peter Wyckoff, often hosted young Ripley at their Park Avenue apartment. Cora&#x27;s and Julia&#x27;s father (his great-grandfather) and partial namesake was Sidney Dillon, twice President of the Union Pacific Railroad. and his uncle was Sidney Dillon Ripley I. Both Gilded Age tycoons.

Ripley&#x27;s early education was at the Montessori Kindergarten School on Madison Avenue. As a young boy, he traveled widely including to British Columbia where his mother&#x27;s relatives lived. In April 1918, his mother, who had separated from his father, moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1919 the family moved again to Boston, where he studied in a school called Rivers. At the age of ten, he traveled again with his mother across Europe. In 1924 Ripley went to a boarding school called Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts.

In 1926 he followed in Louis&#x27; footsteps, attending St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. In 1936, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University. While at Yale he briefly considered a more traditional career path after a conversation with his brother. &quot;Louis told me we ought to have a lawyer in the family,&quot; he has said, &quot;but I really hated the idea, and in the summer of 1936, after graduating from college, I resolved to abandon all thoughts of a prosperous and worthy future and devote myself to birds, the subject I was overpoweringly interested in.&quot;

===Travel and education===
A friend of the Ripleys, John, whose father founded the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, and Celestine Mott were planning a visit to India to set up a YMCA hostel in India. This led to a visit to India at age 13, along with his sister. They stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay and then went to Kashmir and included a walking tour into Ladakh and western Tibet. In Kashmir, they flew falcons with Colonel Biddulph. They also visited Calcutta and Nagpur. One of Ripley&#x27;s brothers shot a tiger at a shoot hosted by a Maharaja. This led to his lifelong interest in the birds of India. He returned to St Paul&#x27;s to complete his studies. It was suggested to him that Yale would be the best for him. Ripley received a training in making specimens from Frank Chapman and even had tea once as a sophomore Erwin Stresemann. He decided that birds were more interesting than law and after graduating from Yale in 1936 he was advised by Ernst Mayr that &quot;the most important thing you can do is get a sound and broad biological training.&quot; He then enrolled at Columbia University. and he began studying zoology at Columbia University. As a part of his study, Ripley participated in the Denison-Crockett Expedition to New Guinea in 1937-1938 and the Vanderbilt Expedition to Sumatra in 1939. He later obtained a PhD in Zoology from Harvard University in 1943.

===War service and academic work===

During World War II, he served under William J. Donovan (&quot;Coordinator of Information&quot;) in the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early days Ripley acted as liaison with the British Security Coordination led by Sir William Stephenson at the Rockefeller Center. He later was in charge of American intelligence services in Southeast Asia. Others who joined the OSS early included Ripley&#x27;s Yale friends Sherman Kent and Wilmarth S. Lewis. Ripley held a high regard for his OSS colleagues and considered it unfair on the part of some to decry those who were socially inclined leading to some calling the organization as &quot;Oh So Social&quot;. Ripley trained many Indonesian spies, all of whom were killed during the war. He was posted briefly to Australia with the identity of a lieutenant colonel in case he was captured. He was to go through England, Egypt, China and then on to India and Ceylon. He then worked with Detachment 404 in Bangkok, working to recover Allied airmen who had been captured in the region with the help of friendly Thais who worked to keep them under cover from the Japanese forces. After this period he moved to Sri Lanka and never got to Australia as originally planned. He worked with and &quot;cultivated&quot; Lord Mountbatten throughout this period. The two often met at dinners and parties both in New Delhi and at Trincomalee. On one occasion, Ripley noticed a green woodpecker and went off to shoot it while dressed only in a towel. The specimen label reads &quot;Shot at cocktail party... towel fell off.&quot; It was in Kandy, Sri Lanka that he met his future wife Mary Livingston and her roommate Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams) both working with the OSS. The anthropologist Gregory Bateson was also here and he would introduce Julia to Paul Child, her future husband. An article in the August 26, 1950 &quot;New Yorker&quot; said that Ripley reversed the usual pattern, where spies posed as ornithologists in order to gain access to sensitive areas, and instead used his position as an intelligence officer to go birding in restricted areas. The government of Thailand awarded him the Order of the White Elephant, a national award for his support of the Thai underground during the war. In 1947, Ripley entered Nepal pretending to be a close confidante of Jawaharlal Nehru and the Nepal government, eager to maintain diplomatic ties with its newly independent neighbour, allowed him and Edward Migdalski to collect bird specimens. Nehru came to hear of this from an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and was furious, leading to a difficult time for his collaborator and coauthor, Salim Ali. Salim Ali came to hear of Nehru&#x27;s displeasure through Horace Alexander and the matter was forgiven after some effort. The OSS past however led to a growing suspicion that American scientists working in India were CIA agents. David Challinor, a former Smithsonian administrator, noted that there were many CIA agents in India, with some posing as scientists. He noted that the Smithsonian sent a scholar to India for anthropological research who unknown to them was interviewing Tibetan refugees from Chinese-occupied Tibet but went on to say that there was no evidence that Ripley worked for the CIA after he left the OSS in 1945.

He joined the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1938, became an Elective Member in 1942, and a fellow in 1951. After the war he taught at Yale and was a Fulbright fellow in 1950 and a Guggenheim fellow in 1954. At Yale, one of the key scientific influences on Ripley was the ecologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson, who had led the Yale expedition to India in 1932. Ripley became a full professor and director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. Ripley served for many years on the board of the World Wildlife Fund in the U.S., and was the third president of the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP, now BirdLife International).

===Smithsonian Institution===

He served as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1964 to 1984. He set out to reinvigorate and expand the Smithsonian, building new museums, including the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, now the Anacostia Community Museum, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Renwick Gallery, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of African Art, Enid A. Haupt Garden, the underground quadrangle complex known as the S. Dillon Ripley Center, and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.

In 1967, he helped found the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and in 1970, he helped found &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine. He believed that 75% to 80% of then-living animal species would become extinct in the next 25 years.

In 1985 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States. He was awarded honorary degrees from 15 colleges and universities, including Brown, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and Cambridge. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Ripley successfully defended the National Museum of Natural History against a lawsuit that objected to the &quot;Dynamics of Evolution&quot; exhibit.

==Legacy==

Ripley had intended to produce a definitive guide to the birds of South Asia, but became too ill to play an active part in its realisation. However, the eventual authors, his assistant, Pamela C. Rasmussen, and artist John C. Anderton, named the final two-volume guide as &quot;Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide&quot; in his honor.

The Smithsonian&#x27;s underground complex on the National Mall, the S. Dillon Ripley Center, is named in his honor. A garden between the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the Arts and Industries Building was dedicated in 1988 to his wife, Mary Livingston Ripley.

The first-ever full-length biography of Ripley, &quot;The Lives of Dillon Ripley: Natural Scientist, Wartime Spy, and Pioneering Leader of the Smithsonian Institution&quot; by Roger D. Stone, was published in 2017.

The Ripley Waterfowl Conservancy, a non-profit organization dedicated to research-driven breeding of rare and endangered waterfowl, is located on 150-acres of the Ripley estate in Litchfield, Connecticut. The Conservancy&#x27;s history began in the 1920s when Ripley began keeping and breeding waterfowl as a teenager, and he is credited with the first captive breedings of Red-breasted goose, Nene, Emperor goose, and Laysan Teal as well as the first US captive breedings of New Zealand scaup, Greenland Mallard (&quot;A. p. conboschas&quot;), and Philippine duck. In 1985, Dillon and his wife, Mary Livingston Ripley, donated the portion of their estate that is today the Conservancy to the non-profit organization that continues to operate it. Today the Conservancy remains one of the only facilities in North America dedicated to breeding and rearing rare and endangered waterfowl and houses over 90 species of birds, totaling over 500 individuals. Ripley&#x27;s daughters and grandchildren continue to their involvement with the Conservancy&#x27;s as members of the board of directors.

<doc id="766589" wikidata="Q7694467" url="?curid=766589" title="Teenage suicide in the United States">
<text>According to a 2023 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents between the ages of 10 and 14, and the third leading cause of death for those between 15 and 25 

In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of ChiId and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Children&#x27;s Hospital Association released a joint statement announcing a youth mental health crisis in the US. Emergency room visits for mental health issues have dramatically increased, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2015, the CDC stated that an estimated 9.3 million adults, which is roughly 4% of the United States population, had suicidal thoughts in one year alone. 1.3 million adults 18 and older attempted suicide in one year, with 1.1 million making plans to die by suicide. Amongst younger youths, suicide is the third leading cause of death of individuals aged from 10 to 14. Males and females are known to have different suicidal tendencies. For example, males take their lives almost four times the rate females do. Males account for approximately 77.9% of all suicides. The female population is more likely to have thoughts of suicide than males. College students aged 18–22 are less likely to attempt suicide than teenagers. 

A 2017 study by the CDC with the help of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard, and Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital revealed that suicide rates dropping in certain states has been linked to the legalization of same sex marriage in those same states. Suicide rates as a whole fell about 7% but the rates among specifically gay, lesbian, and bisexual teenagers fell by 14%. In 2013, an estimated 494,169 people were treated in emergency departments for self-inflicted, nonfatal injuries, which left an estimated $10.4 billion in combined medical and work loss costs.

Suicide differs by race and ethnic backgrounds. In 2015, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ranked suicide as the 8th leading cause for American Indians/Alaska Natives. Hispanic students in grades 9–12 have the following percentages: having seriously considered attempting suicide (18.9%), having made a plan about how they would attempt suicide (15.7%), having attempted suicide (11.3%), and having made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that required medical attention (4.1%). These percentages are consistently worse than those of white and black students.

Potential signs include threatening the well-being of oneself and others through physical violence, a desire to run away from home, property damage, giving away belongings, joking about/referencing suicide, using drugs, isolating themselves, sleeping too much or too little, fatigue, despair, and extreme mood swings, among other things. Parents witnessing such threats are recommended to immediately speak with their child and seek immediate mental health evaluation.

==Population differences==
===Sex ratio===

In 2005, male adolescents died by suicide at a rate five times greater than that of female adolescents. In 2005, suicide attempts by females were three times as frequent as those by males. A possible reason for this is the method of attempted suicide for males is typically that of firearm use, with a 78–90% chance of fatality. Females are more likely to try a different method, such as ingesting poison. Females have more parasuicides.
This includes using different methods, such as drug overdose, which are usually less effective.
===Ethnic groups===
Suicide rates vary for different ethnic groups. In 1998, suicides among European Americans accounted for 84% of all youth suicides, 61% male and 23% female. The suicide rate for Native Americans was 19.3 per 100,000, much higher than the overall rate of 8.5 per 100,000. The suicide rate for African Americans has increased more than twofold since 1981. A national survey of high school students conducted in 1999 reported that Hispanic students are twice as likely to report attempted suicide as white students.

From 2003 to 2023, the suicide rate for Black youth increased faster than any other racial or ethnic group. By 2021, suicide rates were increasing for Black children. From 2022, the suicide rate of Black youth exceeded that of White youth for the first time.

Black youth deal with the challenges of normal adolescence but also face issues created by systemic racism and discrimination. Racial disparities in the health care system and other institutions and the stigma associated with mental illness create barriers for black adolescents to access and obtain treatment. In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics came out with a statement about the impact of racism on black youth. Both overt racism and implicit bias take a psychological toll on black children. Institutional and systemic racism, overt and implicit, impact black youth&#x27;s physical and emotional well-being.

===2007 study===
On September 6, 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported suicide rate in American adolescents (especially boys, 10 to 24 years old) increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years. Specifically, in 2004 there were 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24, up from 4,232 in 2003, for a rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. Before, the rate dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Some psychiatrists argue that the increase is due to the decline in prescriptions of antidepressant drugs like Prozac to young people since 2003, leaving more cases of serious depression untreated. In a December 2006 study, &quot;The American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; said that a decrease in antidepressant prescriptions to minors of just a few percentage points coincided with a 14 percent increase in suicides in the United States; in the Netherlands, the suicide rate was 50% up, upon prescription drop. Despite the language of the study, however, the results appear to have been directly conflicted by the actual suicide rates in subsequent years. Youth suicide declined consistently every year from 2005 to 2007, and in 2007 reached a record low, even as the suicide rate for other groups increased.

===LGBTQ+ youth===

In 2008, researchers found that the rate of suicide attempts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth was higher than among the general population. LGBT teens and young adults have one of the highest rates of suicide attempts. In 2012, according to some groups, this is linked to heterocentric cultures and institutionalized homophobia in some cases, including the use of LGBT people as a political wedge issue like in the contemporary efforts to halt legalizing same-sex marriages. 

A 2010 study found that depression and drug use among LGBT people increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed. Bullying of LGBT youth has been shown to be a contributing factor in many suicides, even if not all of the attacks have been specifically addressing sexuality or gender.

== Methods ==
In 2015, males more commonly used a firearm to die by suicide, while females commonly used a form of poison. 

In 2018, the most common suicide method among females aged 15 to 25 was suffocation.

==Causes in teenage suicide==
Teenage suicide is not caused by any one factor, but likely by a combination of them. Depression can play a massive role in teenage suicide. Some contributing factors include:

*Eating disorders
*Drug abuse
*Sexual abuse/rape
*Divorce of parents
*Trauma
*Household financial problems
*Being bullied
*Social rejection
*Anger/guilt
*Relationship breakup
*Illness
*Disability/deformations
*Domestic violence or abuse
*Academic failure in school and grade retention
*Loneliness
*Feelings of being misunderstood
*Insecurities
*Extreme mood swings
*Loss of a loved one
*Mental disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia.

Eating disorders have the highest correlation with a suicide rate of any mental illness, most commonly affecting teenagers (since data is correlational it is not possible to say with certainty that A causes B, and it is instead possible that a third variable is causing both [see Correlation and dependence]). Teenagers with Eating Disorders&#x27; suicide risk is about 15%.
Perceived lack of parental interest is also a major factor in teenage suicide. According to one study, 90% of suicidal teenagers believed their families did not understand them.

Depression is the most common cause of suicide. About 75% of those individuals who die by suicide are depressed. Depression is caused by a number of factors, from chemical imbalances to psychological make-up to environmental influences.
According to a 2019 survey, 50% of female pupils and one-third of high school students reported having continuous feelings of melancholy or hopelessness, a 40% rise from 2009.

There is a correlation between the use of social media and the increase in mental illness and teen suicide. Recent studies are showing that there is a link between using social media platforms and depression and anxiety. A recent national survey of 1787 young adults looked at the use of 11 different social media platforms. The survey showed that the teens that used between 7 and 11 platforms were three times at risk for depression or anxiety. Depression is one of the leading causes of suicide. Another problem with teens and social media is cyberbullying. When teens are on social media that can say whatever they want about anybody and they do not feel there are any repercussions for their actions. They do not have to look their victims in the eyes and see the hurt and torment they are causing. The link between cyberbullying and teen suicide is one reason that people are trying to criminalize cyberbullying. In 2011 the US Center for Disease Control showed that 13.7% of teens that reported being cyberbullied had attempted suicide. A Facebook internal study found that 13.5% of teenage girls say Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse.

==Suicide prevention==

===Means reduction===
A 2009 study argued that limiting young people&#x27;s access to lethal means, such as firearms, has reduced means-specific suicide rates. Child access prevention (CAP) laws were put in place with the intention to reduce gun related deaths of those under the age of 17. CAP laws first focus is on negligent storage of firearms to encourage gun owners to safely store weapons and limit accessibility. CAP laws differ from state to state, but can carry felony charges if there is an incident of negligent storage.

Another focus is on the reckless provision of firearms, which refers to children being given guns, and then having an accident. These laws were a response to high volumes of children dying by suicide, crimes, and accidents, with the highest number of deaths in 1993. The highest rate was in 1993, with 4.87 children per 100,000 killed in firearm related incidents. The effects of these laws brought down firearm related incidents to 1.87 per 100,000 by 2009, which was a reduction from over 3,000 deaths to 1,400.

===Suicide awareness programs===
School-based youth suicide awareness programs have been developed to increase high-school students&#x27; awareness of the problem, provide knowledge about the behavioral characteristics of teens at risk (i.e., screening lists), and describe available treatment or counseling resources. However, the American Surgeon General David Satcher warned in 1999 that &quot;indiscriminate suicide awareness efforts and overly inclusive screening lists may promote suicide as a possible solution to ordinary distress or suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are normal responses to stress.&quot; The 1991 study Satcher cited (reference 45 in the report) for this claim, however, surveyed only two schools over 18 months, and the study&#x27;s authors concluded that the suicide awareness program did not affect. Satcher&#x27;s claim, while it may be correct, was not based on a consensus among public health professionals. The Canadian journal of public health references nine studies being done on the effects of awareness programs on teenagers. These studies were mainly conducted in the US showing five of them having positive effects on teenagers making them more likely to seek help. However, there was one study that had a negative impact making teenagers aware that suicide was a possible option rather than dealing with their problems. This study also found that males are more likely to suggest suicide as a solution rather than females.

===Threats of suicide===
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention advocates taking suicide threats seriously. Seventy-five percent of all suicides are of people who have given some warning of their intentions to a friend or family member. SAVE, the Suicide Voices of Education Foundation, states that threats of suicide are the main warning factors for someone taking their own life. Warning factors include planning a suicide, talking about dying by suicide, or looking for weapons to harm themselves. These signs can mean that a person is in need of immediate attention from health officials or a suicide prevention organization.

People who are at risk for suicide may be resistant to admit they have suicidal intentions because of the stigma that comes with mental illness. This is another obstacle of suicide prevention, because people do not want to be labeled by their mental illness. Someone who is making threats may be helped by recommending they talk to their family, religious leaders, clinical professionals, or suicide prevention organizations.

=== Suicide survivors ===
SAVE refers to people who have been affected by suicide, whether a friend or family member, as suicide survivors. Suicide begets suicide, because the loss of a loved one can place that person at risk to take their own life. A 1993 study showed that suicide survivors had increased thoughts of suicide, and other psychological problems, such as PTSD. Clusters of suicides are often found in communities, because it is a mental contagion that can influence others to commit the same act.

To prevent clusters, the CDC created guidelines to intervene with those affected by these incidents. The people considered to have had a close relationship with the victim should be given counseling as soon as possible, and then be referred to any additional treatment if needed. The section below list treatments for at people at Risk.

==Treatment==
A common treatment for a young, suicidal patient is a combination of drug-based treatment, e.g. imipramine or fluoxetine, with a &#x27;talking-based&#x27; therapy, such as referral to a cognitive behaviour therapist. This kind of therapy concentrates on modifying self-destructive and irrational thought processes.

In a crisis situation, professional help can be sought, either at a hospital or a walk-in clinic. There are several telephone help numbers for help on teenage suicide, depending on one&#x27;s location, by country or state. In the US, dialing 988 will connect to the nearest support hotline. Sometimes emergency services can be contacted.

==Suicide in colleges==
In colleges and universities in the United States, suicide is one of the most common causes of death among students. As of 2010, approximately 24,000 college students attempt suicide each year, while 1,100 students succeed in their attempt, making suicide the second-leading cause of death among U.S. college students. 

In 2010, roughly 12% of college students reported the occurrence of suicide ideation during their first four years in college, with 2.6% percent reporting persistent suicide ideation. In 2013, 65% of college students reported that they knew someone who has either attempted or died by suicide, showing that the majority of students on college campuses are exposed to suicide or suicidal attempts.

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), approximately 49% of the student population within the educational system have been diagnosed with or treated for depression. A 2016 study found that underclassmen are less likely to commit suicide compared to upperclassmen due to a lack of worry over bills or work. Many are full-time students living with their parents.

<text>The honorary citizen award () is the highest decoration of Hamburg, Germany. The awards have been given sporadically since 1813, originally only to non-Hamburg citizens (with one exception, Johannes Brahms in 1889) &quot;to make them as one of us&quot; (&quot;um sie zu einem der unseren zu machen&quot;). Since 1948, it has been extended to Hamburg citizens as well.

The awards are given by the Senate of Hamburg, and since 1848 the state parliament (&quot;Hamburgische Bürgerschaft&quot;) is asked to confirm the honor. It can also be revoked (as in the case of Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring), and gives no rights or duty.

==Honorary Citizens of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg==

<text>In the UK, the tax-exempt special savings account (TESSA) was one of a number of tax-free savings accounts. The TESSA was announced by John Major in his only budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1990 (the &quot;budget for savings&quot;) and at first had a five-year lifespan. The TESSA was intended to be a low-risk complement to the personal equity plan (PEP) which would be attractive to a wider range of savers. The accounts were replaced by Individual Savings Accounts in 1999.

==Eligibility==
An individual aged 18 or over was able to open a TESSA with a bank, building society or other financial institution from 1 January 1991 to 5 April 1999. A specific requirement was the presentation of the applicant&#x27;s National Insurance number, to ensure only one TESSA (tax free) account investment could be operated by the individual per year. Interest on the TESSA was free from UK income tax. The favourable tax treatment of a TESSA lasted for five years, and it was possible to invest up to £9,000, with a maximum investment of £3,000 in the first year and £1,800 in each of the second to fifth years (although, if the maximum was invested in the first four years, only £600 could be added in the fifth year). Withdrawals were permitted within the first five years: tax relief was clawed back if any of the invested capital was taken out, but withdrawals of interest did not trigger a clawback of the tax relief.

==Evolution==
&#x27;Follow-on&#x27; TESSAs were introduced in 1995 to permit all of the capital (but not the tax-free interest) from an original TESSA to be &#x27;rolled over&#x27; into a new TESSA. Other than permitting all of the capital from the original account to be invested in the first year, which could easily exceed the usual £3,000 first-year limit, a &#x27;follow-on&#x27; TESSA was subject to the same conditions as any other TESSA.

==Phasing out==
TESSAs were replaced from 1999 by Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs). The final TESSAs matured on 5 April 2004, and the original capital (but not the tax-free interest) could again be &#x27;rolled over&#x27; into a new income-tax-free investment, a TESSA-only ISA (TOISA). This was a form of cash ISA that could be opened using either capital that was originally invested in a TESSA and that had not been withdrawn, or with funds transferred from another TOISA.

From 6 April 2007 there was no practical difference between TOISAs and cash ISAs, and transfers into cash ISAs were permitted. On 5 April 2008, TOISAs ceased being legally distinct and are now interchangeable with cash ISAs.

<doc id="766600" wikidata="Q739612" url="?curid=766600" title="Matsumoto Castle">
<text>, originally known as Fukashi Castle, is one of Japan&#x27;s premier historic castles, along with Himeji and Kumamoto. It was the seat of Matsumoto Domain under the Edo Period Tokugawa shogunate. It is located in the city of Matsumoto, in Nagano Prefecture.

The keep , which was completed in the late sixteenth century, maintains its original wooden interiors and external stonework. It is listed as a National Treasure of Japan, and is one of the twelve surviving &quot;tenshu&quot; in Japan. It is surrounded by four other buildings also designated as National Treasures.

Matsumoto Castle is a flatland castle because it is not built on a hilltop or amid rivers, but on a plain. Its complete defences would have included an extensive system of inter-connecting walls, moats, and gatehouses.

==History==

The castle&#x27;s origins go back to the Sengoku period. A fortification was built at this location by the &quot;shugō&quot; of Shinano Province, Shimadachi Sadanaga of the Ogasawara clan during the Eisho era (1504–1520). This minor border post was originally called Fukashi Castle. In 1550 it was seized by the Takeda clan following the Siege of Fukashi.

Takeda Shingen appointed his retainer Baba Nobuharu as castellan. The castle was the Takeda field headquarters for their conquest of the Matsumoto Basin and as a redoubt in the constant conflict between the Takeda and the powerful Uesugi clan to the north. Following the defeat of the Takeda clan by Oda Nobunaga in 1582, the castle was surrendered to Oda Nagamasu. It was soon reassigned to Kiso Yoshimasa.

With the assassination of Oda Nobunaga in 1582, the castle was seized by Ogasawara Dosetsuzai with the backing of Uesugi Kagekatsu. His nephew, Ogasawara Sadayoshi, later pledged fealty to Tokugawa Ieyasu, and renamed the castle &quot;Matsumoto Castle&quot;.

Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s conquest of Odawara in 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was transferred from his ancestral domains to the Kantō region, and Ishikawa Kazumasa was placed in charge of Matsumoto. Kazumasa and his son Yasunaga built the tower and other parts of the castle, including the three towers: the &quot;tenshu&quot; and the small &quot;yagura&quot; in the northwest, both begun in 1590, and the &quot;Watari Yagura&quot;, the residence, the drum gate, the black gate, the &quot;Tsukimi Yagura&quot;, the moat, the innermost bailey, the second bailey, the third bailey, and the sub-floors in the castle, much as they are today. They were also instrumental in laying out the castle town and its infrastructure. It is believed much of the castle was completed by 1593–94.

During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate established the Matsumoto Domain. The Ogasawara returned briefly as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Matsumoto from 1613 to 1617. They were followed by the Toda-Matsudaira clan from 1617 to 1633, Matsudaira clan from 1633 to 1638, Hotta clan from 1638 to 1642, Mizuno clan from 1642 to 1725 and by the Toda-Matsudaira clan again from 1725 to the Meiji restoration in 1868.

==Preservation==

In 1872, the new Meiji government ordered the destruction of all former feudal fortifications. Most of the castle structures were razed, and the outer grounds of Matsumoto Castle were sold off at auction for redevelopment. When news broke that the &quot;tenshu&quot; was going to be demolished, an influential figure from Matsumoto, Ichikawa Ryōzō, along with residents from Matsumoto, started a campaign to save the building. Their efforts were rewarded when the tower was acquired by the city government.

The &quot;daimyo&quot; residence in the Ni-no-Maru enclosure was also preserved for use as the prefectural office for Chikuma Prefecture. However, it was burned down in an act of arson in 1876, with only a storehouse dating from the end of the Edo period surviving. At the time, Chikuma and Nagano prefectures were about to be merged to form modern-day Nagano Prefecture, and there was a controversy over where to locate the prefectural capital. The loss of this building decided the location in favor of Nagano city, and the Matsumoto District Court was built on the site in 1878.

In the late Meiji period the &quot;tenshu&quot; started to lean to one side. It was because of neglect coupled with a structural defect, but many people believed the tower leaned due to the curse of Tada Kasuke. He had been caught and executed for attempting to appeal unfair tax laws (Jōkyō uprising). A local high school principal, Kobayashi Unari, decided to renovate the castle and appealed for funds. The castle underwent &quot;the great Meiji renovation&quot; between 1903 and 1913.

The castle was designated a National Historic Site in 1930. The five surviving original structures in the main keep complex ( &quot;Tenshu&quot;, &quot;Inui-ko-tenshu&quot; (small northern tower), &quot;Watari-yagura&quot; (roofed passage), &quot;Tatsumi-tsuke-yagura&quot; (southern wing), and &quot;Tsukimi-yagura&quot; (moon-viewing room) ) were designated as National Treasures of Japan in 1952. This enabled access to government funding for a major restoration project from 1950 to 1955, during which these buildings were dismantled and rebuilt. The surviving storehouse from the Ni-no-Maru daimyo residence also still stands in the Ni-no-Maru.

In 1990, the &quot;Kuromon-Ninomon&quot; (second gate of the Black Gate) and &quot;sodebei&quot; (side wall) were reconstructed. The square drum gate was reconstructed in 1999.

On April 6, 2006, Matsumoto Castle was selected as one of Japan&#x27;s Top 100 Castles.

Matsumoto Castle was damaged in a 5.4 magnitude earthquake on June 30, 2011. The quake caused around ten cracks in the inner wall of the main castle tower.

There is a plan for restoring the &quot;soto-bori&quot; (outer moat), which was reclaimed for a residential zone.

The second floor of the main keep features a gun museum, &quot;Teppo Gura&quot;, with a collection of guns, armor, and other weapons.

<doc id="766619" wikidata="Q633570" url="?curid=766619" title="Cyclonic separation">
<text>Cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air, gas or liquid stream, without the use of filters, through vortex separation. When removing particulate matter from liquid, a hydrocyclone is used; while from gas, a gas cyclone is used. Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids. The method can also be used to separate fine droplets of liquid from a gaseous stream.

== Operation ==
A high-speed rotating (air)flow is established within a cylindrical or conical container called a cyclone. Air flows in a helical pattern, beginning at the top (wide end) of the cyclone and ending at the bottom (narrow) end before exiting the cyclone in a straight stream through the center of the cyclone and out the top. Larger (denser) particles in the rotating stream have too much inertia to follow the tight curve of the stream, and thus strike the outside wall, then fall to the bottom of the cyclone where they can be removed. In a conical system, as the rotating flow moves towards the narrow end of the cyclone, the rotational radius of the stream is reduced, thus separating smaller and smaller particles. The cyclone geometry, together with volumetric flow rate, defines the &quot;cut point&quot; of the cyclone. This is the size of particle that will be removed from the stream with a 50% efficiency. Particles larger than the cut point will be removed with a greater efficiency, and smaller particles with a lower efficiency as they separate with more difficulty or can be subject to re-entrainment when the air vortex reverses direction to move in direction of the outlet.

An alternative cyclone design uses a secondary air flow within the cyclone to keep the collected particles from striking the walls, to protect them from abrasion. The primary air flow containing the particulates enters from the bottom of the cyclone and is forced into spiral rotation by stationary spinner vanes. The secondary air flow enters from the top of the cyclone and moves downward toward the bottom, intercepting the particulate from the primary air. The secondary air flow also allows the collector to optionally be mounted horizontally, because it pushes the particulate toward the collection area, and does not rely solely on gravity to perform this function.

== Uses ==
Cyclone separators are found in all types of power and industrial applications, including pulp and paper plants, cement plants, steel mills, petroleum coke plants, metallurgical plants, saw mills and other kinds of facilities that process dust.

Large scale cyclones are used in sawmills to remove sawdust from extracted air. Cyclones are also used in oil refineries to separate oils and gases, and in the cement industry as components of kiln preheaters. Cyclones are increasingly used in the household, as the core technology in bagless types of portable vacuum cleaners and central vacuum cleaners. Cyclones are also used in industrial and professional kitchen ventilation for separating the grease from the exhaust air in extraction hoods. Smaller cyclones are used to separate airborne particles for analysis. Some are small enough to be worn clipped to clothing, and are used to separate respirable particles for later analysis.

Similar separators are used in the oil refining industry (e.g. for Fluid catalytic cracking) to achieve fast separation of the catalyst particles from the reacting gases and vapors.

Analogous devices for separating particles or solids from liquids are called hydrocyclones or hydroclones. These may be used to separate solid waste from water in wastewater and sewage treatment.

== Types ==

The most common types of centrifugal, or inertial, collectors in use today are:

=== Single-cyclone separators ===
Single-cyclone separators create a dual vortex to separate coarse from fine dust. The main vortex spirals downward and carries most of the coarser dust particles. The inner vortex, created near the bottom of the cyclone, spirals upward and carries finer dust particles.

=== Multiple-cyclone separators ===

Multiple-cyclone separators consist of a number of small-diameter cyclones, operating in parallel and having a common gas inlet and outlet, as shown in the figure, and operate on the same principle as single cyclone separators—creating an outer downward vortex and an ascending inner vortex.

Multiple-cyclone separators remove more dust than single cyclone separators because the individual cyclones have a greater length and smaller diameter. The longer length provides longer residence time while the smaller diameter creates greater centrifugal force. These two factors result in better separation of dust particulates. The pressure drop of multiple-cyclone separators collectors is higher than that of single-cyclone separators, requiring more energy to clean the same amount of air. A single-chamber cyclone separator of the same volume is more economical, but doesn&#x27;t remove as much dust.

=== Secondary-air-flow separators ===
This type of cyclone uses a secondary air flow, injected into the cyclone to accomplish several things. The secondary air flow increases the speed of the cyclonic action making the separator more efficient; it intercepts the particulate before it reaches the interior walls of the unit; and it forces the separated particulate toward the collection area. The secondary air flow protects the separator from particulate abrasion and allows the separator to be installed horizontally because gravity is not depended upon to move the separated particulate downward.

== Cyclone theory ==
As the cyclone is essentially a two phase particle-fluid system, fluid mechanics and particle transport equations can be used to describe the behaviour of a cyclone. The air in a cyclone is initially introduced tangentially into the cyclone with an inlet velocity formula_1. Assuming that the particle is spherical, a simple analysis to calculate critical separation particle sizes can be established.

If one considers an isolated particle circling in the upper cylindrical component of the cyclone at a rotational radius of formula_2 from the cyclone&#x27;s central axis, the particle is therefore subjected to drag, centrifugal, and buoyant forces. Given that the fluid velocity is moving in a spiral the gas velocity can be broken into two component velocities: a tangential component, formula_3, and an outward radial velocity component formula_4. Assuming Stokes&#x27; law, the drag force in the outward radial direction that is opposing the outward velocity on any particle in the inlet stream is:

:formula_5

Using formula_6 as the particle&#x27;s density, the centrifugal component in the outward radial direction is:

:formula_7
::formula_8

The buoyant force component is in the inward radial direction. It is in the opposite direction to the particle&#x27;s centrifugal force because it is on a volume of fluid that is missing compared to the surrounding fluid. Using formula_9 for the density of the fluid, the buoyant force is:

:formula_10
::formula_11

In this case, formula_12 is equal to the volume of the particle (as opposed to the velocity). Determining the outward radial motion of each particle is found by setting Newton&#x27;s second law of motion equal to the sum of these forces:

:formula_13

To simplify this, we can assume the particle under consideration has reached &quot;terminal velocity&quot;, i.e., that its acceleration formula_14 is zero. This occurs when the radial velocity has caused enough drag force to counter the centrifugal and buoyancy forces. This simplification changes our equation to:

formula_15

Which expands to:

:formula_16

Solving for formula_4 we have

:formula_18.

Notice that if the density of the fluid is greater than the density of the particle, the motion is (-), toward the center of rotation and if the particle is denser than the fluid, the motion is (+), away from the center. In most cases, this solution is used as guidance in designing a separator, while actual performance is evaluated and modified empirically.

In non-equilibrium conditions when radial acceleration is not zero, the general equation from above must be solved. Rearranging terms we obtain

:formula_19

Since formula_4 is distance per time, this is a 2nd order differential equation of the form formula_21.

Experimentally it is found that the velocity component of rotational flow is proportional to formula_22, therefore:

:formula_23

This means that the established feed velocity controls the vortex rate inside the cyclone, and the velocity at an arbitrary radius is therefore:

:formula_24

Subsequently, given a value for formula_3, possibly based upon the injection angle, and a cutoff radius, a characteristic particle filtering radius can be estimated, above which particles will be removed from the gas stream.

=== Alternative models ===
The above equations are limited in many regards. For example, the geometry of the separator is not considered, the particles are assumed to achieve a steady state and the effect of the vortex inversion at the base of the cyclone is also ignored, all behaviours which are unlikely to be achieved in a cyclone at real operating conditions.

More complete models exist, as many authors have studied the behaviour of cyclone separators. Simplified models allowing a quick calculation of the cyclone, with some limitations, have been developed for common applications in process industries. Numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics has also been used extensively in the study of cyclonic behaviour. A major limitation of any fluid mechanics model for cyclone separators is the inability to predict the agglomeration of fine particles with larger particles, which has a great impact on cyclone collection efficiency.

<doc id="766626" wikidata="Q285930" url="?curid=766626" title="MS Selandia">
<text>Selandia (after the Latin name for the Danish island of Sjælland) was the name of three ships of the Danish East Asiatic Company, the best known of which, the first MS &quot;Selandia&quot; of 1912, was the most advanced ocean-going diesel motor ship of her time.

== Construction ==
&quot;Selandia&quot; and sister ship &quot;Fionia&quot; were results of negotiations between the Danish East Asiatic Company&#x27;s president, Hans Niels Andersen, and Burmeister &amp; Wain shipyards, Copenhagen, Denmark which had been introduced to the concept of marine diesel engines by engineer Ivar Knudsen, who led the ship&#x27;s development. Negotiations were also underway for the Scottish firm of Barclay, Curle &amp; Company to build Diesel motors on the Danish system and a third ship, to be a counterpart of &quot;Selandia&quot; and &quot;Fionia&quot;, named .

She was built at Burmeister &amp; Wain in Copenhagen, and launched on 4 November 1911 before embarking on her maiden journey from Copenhagen to Bangkok on 22 February 1912. &quot;Selandia&quot; did not have a funnel; instead exhaust from her engines escaped through exhaust ports in the aft mast.

Built for cargo and passenger services between Scandinavia, Genoa, Italy, and Bangkok, Thailand, &quot;Selandia&quot; had &quot;very ample and rather luxurious&quot; cabins for 20 first class passengers, single-berth cabins of &quot;exceptional size, with toilet and bath for every two cabins, and an extra feature is the servants&#x27; rooms, arranged in connection with private cabins.&quot;

She is frequently referred to as &quot;the world&#x27;s first large ocean-going diesel-powered ship&quot;, an &quot;experiment,&quot; as previous powered vessels were driven by steam. The new motorships were described as &quot;smokeless&quot; and caused some to describe them as &quot;phantom ships&quot; with an incident during the trials for &quot;Selandia&quot; in which a captain of another ship ignored warnings and ran across her bows because he &quot;saw no smoke.&quot; Some onlookers in London, perturbed by this new system, called it &quot;the Devil Ship.&quot; The ship attracted curious crowds from London to San Francisco that were often skeptical of a deep ocean ship not powered by the commonly used triple expansion steam engine; yet within ten years there were over 2,000,000 deadweight capacity tons in commerce powered by diesel engines and British experts calculated the motorship had a 40% advantage in fuel costs, with fewer crew and steadier sea speeds.

There is evidence to say that the engine installation in &quot;Selandia&quot; was a world-first on numerous points, but she was not the world&#x27;s first diesel-driven ocean-going ship, having been beaten to it by the Dutch tanker &quot;Vulcanus&quot; two years earlier.

== Service ==
&quot;Selandia&quot; was the largest and most advanced diesel-driven ship at the time of her maiden voyage by way of Aalborg to London in January 1912 after completing trials in Øresund. She arrived in London on 27 February at West India Docks during a coal strike where she attracted attention as the first large transoceanic ship independent of coal and was visited by Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. On her passage upriver assistance had been offered as none had before seen a large ship without a smokestack and thought she had suffered damage. From London &quot;Selandia&quot; sailed for Antwerp with cargo and a number of the prominent guests that had visited the ship in London as well as members of the press. From Antwerp the ship began a voyage to east Asian ports and was noteworthy for burning only 800 tons of fuel from Copenhagen to Bangkok whereas a coal burning ship would have required fuel taking up greatly more cubic space and dead weight.

She was sold to Panama in 1936 and renamed &quot;Norseman&quot;, and &quot;Tornator&quot; in 1940. 1941:Chartered to Yamashita Kisen (Steamship Co.) K.K. of Tokyo. The Finnish crew stays on board. Referred to in all official Japanese records as Tornator GO. Assigned to the Japan-Darien, Manchuria line.

==Later ships named &quot;Selandia&quot;==
A second ship of the same name was built in 1938 and scrapped in 1962. The third &quot;Selandia&quot;, built in 1972, was sold to USA in 1994 and renamed in 1998. Eitzen Maritime Services owned and operated a third vessel named &quot;Selandia&quot;.
== Films ==
&quot;The Ship that Changed the World&quot; is a 60-minute drama documentary about the first oceangoing diesel-driven ship, M/S &quot;Selandia&quot;. The film was produced in 2012 by Chroma Film ApS, with executive producer Anders Dylov for the 100-year anniversary on 17 February of that year. It was directed by Michael Schmidt-Olsen.

<text>Dillingen or Dillingen an der Donau (Dillingen at the Danube) is a town in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is the administrative center of the district of Dillingen.

Besides the town of Dillingen proper, the municipality encompasses the villages of Donaualtheim, Fristingen, Hausen, Kicklingen, Schretzheim and Steinheim.

Schretzheim is notable for its 6th to 7th century Alemannic cemetery, 630 row graves in an area of 100 by 140 metres.

==History==
The counts of Dillingen ruled from the 10th to the 13th century; in 1258 the territory was turned over to the Prince Bishops of Augsburg. After the Reformation, the prince-bishops of Augsburg moved to the Catholic city of Dillingen and made it one of the centers of the Counter-Reformation.

In 1800, during the War of the Second Coalition, the armies of the French First Republic, under command of Jean Victor Moreau, fought Habsburg regulars and Württemberg contingents, under the general command of Pál Kray. Kray had taken refuge in the fortress at Ulm; Moreau diverted his army to approach Ulm from the east and, after a small group of men captured a foothold on the northern bank of the Danube, his forces were able to move against the fortress on both sides of the river. At this battle, the culmination of the Danube Campaign of 1800, Moreau forced Kray to abandon Ulm and withdraw into eastern Bavaria.

A university was established in 1549, but was closed by Napoleon in 1804. The philosophical and theological faculties still existed in the 20th century. In 1971, however, it became a part of the Bavarian Center for the Education and Training of Teachers and Personnel Management (Akademie für Lehrerfortbildung und Personalführung). One of the largest employers in the city is Bosch and Siemens Household Appliances, producer of household appliances.

<doc id="766631" wikidata="Q2432773" url="?curid=766631" title="Florida State Road 417">
<text>State Road 417 (SR 417), also known as the Central Florida GreeneWay, Seminole County Expressway (depending on the location), Eastern Beltway and Orlando East Bypass, is a controlled-access toll road forming the eastern beltway around the city of Orlando, Florida, United States. It is owned and maintained by the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise. The CFX section was posthumously named after former Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority chairman Jim Greene.

SR 417 was originally planned to be a full beltway around Orlando. Eventually, the beltway was divided, with the west side being designated SR 429, and the east side retaining the SR 417 designation. Until 2024, the two expressways were non-continuous. SR 429 is now extended via Wekiva Parkway to meet SR 417 in the Sanford/Heathrow area.

==Route description==
Although SR 417 is signed north–south throughout its entire route, it runs east–west between Celebration and CR 15. After the latter road, it runs north–south through the rest of its route.

The Southern Connector as well as the beltway begins at an interchange with I-4 in Celebration. This section, run by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise is , extending to the International Drive interchange.

Between the International Drive interchange and the Orange–Seminole county line, the tollway is known as the Central Florida GreeneWay, and is operated by CFX.

The Seminole Expressway section of the tollway begins at the county line. This section, also run by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise is , extends to an interchange with I-4 in Sanford at the end of the beltway.

==Tolls==
There are six mainline toll plazas on the tollway and have at least one express lane dedicated to E-Pass/SunPass for electronic toll collection (ETC), which do not require motorists to stop at a booth, as well as lanes dedicated to cash collection. The Celebration toll plaza has one ETC lane, and all of the others have at least two ETC lanes. The ramp toll plazas have a lane dedicated to ETC and exact change only, with no change provided.

While both E-Pass and SunPass are accepted at all interchanges along the toll road, portions maintained by CFX are signed as E-Pass and portions maintained by FTE are signed as SunPass.

==History==

===Phase I: The Eastern Beltway===

The first phase of SR 417, then termed the Eastern Beltway, extended from what was the east end of the East–West Expressway northward to SR 426 (Aloma Avenue) in Seminole County. It allowed commuters to bypass the crowded Semoran Boulevard, as well as give expressway access to the University of Central Florida.

The OOCEA began construction of phase I in July 1987 and the road was opened to the public on December 16, 1988, at a cost of $105 million, with $35 million being spent on acquiring the right-of-way for the route.

===Phase II: The Southeastern Beltway===

Phase II, the &quot;Southeastern Beltway&quot;, was considered one of the most important parts of the Eastern Beltway because motorists could use this portion to travel from downtown Orlando to the Orlando International Airport without ever getting off the expressway system. This portion of the GreeneWay had passed through some of the most barren portions of Orange County. It skirts the Econlockhatchee River marshes that cover some of eastern Orange and northern Osceola.

The OOCEA began construction of the Southeastern Beltway, from Colonial Drive to the Beachline Expressway in January 1989, and opened ahead of schedule in July 1990. The route cost $72 million, with an estimated $13 million being spent on acquiring the right-of-way.

===Phase III: The Southern Connector===
The &quot;Southern Connector&quot; was to become a route extending from SR 528 all the way to SR 535. The OOCEA began construction of the road in November 1991 and completed construction July 1, 1993, at a cost of $273 million. It was during the construction of this section that the Orange County portion of the beltway project was renamed the Central Florida GreeneWay. From 2015 through 2016, a limited interchange was completed with SR 417 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. The remaining ramps to complete the full interchange were opened May 21, 2021.

===Phase IV: The Seminole Expressway===

The Seminole Expressway, the northern leg of SR 417, is located in Seminole County and is owned and operated by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise. The section south of Aloma Avenue to the county line (less than one mile) was acquired from the Seminole County Expressway Authority in April 1990 as part of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Expansion Program authorized by Senate Bill 1316.

The initial stretch, from just south of Aloma to US 17/92 opened in phases in 1994. The final six miles (10 km) connect to Interstate 4 near Sanford/Lake Mary, and opened to traffic on September 15, 2002, approximately seven months ahead of the final schedule. This leg features only one mainline toll plaza (just south of CR 427), but it is also the priciest toll plaza on SR 417 at $2.50 per vehicle. This section also features the only &quot;free movement&quot; on SR 417. No toll is collected for motorists traveling between I-4 and Rinehart Road (whose interchange with SR 417 is used for travelers on SR 46 and CR 46A to get to and from SR 417).

===Phase V: Southern Connector Extension===
Due to the multiple entities involved, which included OOCEA, Walt Disney World, Osceola County, private landowners, the Reedy Creek Improvement District, and the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise, building the southernmost between I-4 and the GreeneWay became a complex task. Eventually, they agreed on the Southern Connector Extension, as well as the Osceola Parkway.

Florida&#x27;s Turnpike began construction of the extension from the GreeneWay to I-4 in 1994 and completed construction in mid 1996. The project cost almost $153 million, with $74 million coming from contributions from the private parties involved in building this route, making it possible to get from Walt Disney World to the Orlando International Airport without ever driving on Interstate 4.

===Later changes===
In 2008, the Turnpike Enterprise began a $49 million project to reconstruct the Lake Jesup toll plaza, allowing for the inclusion of SunPass/E-PASS express lanes. The project was completed in April 2011.

On December 14, 2011, the northern terminus of SR 417 was extended from Interstate 4 to International Parkway. The $11.4 million project began construction on November 29, 2010.

The Turnpike Enterprise and OOCEA (now CFX) agreed to build a partial interchange between SR 417 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike in the late 2000s, after negotiations dating back to a 1991 field study. The interchange was built in two phases. The first phase, built by CFX, added ramps from southbound SR 417 to southbound Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and from northbound Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to northbound SR 417. Construction on the first phase began in September 2013 and opened on January 26, 2015. The second phase to complete the interchange was built by the FTE, with construction beginning in late 2014 and completed in 2017, several years ahead of its original completion date.

In January 2015, the speed limit along the entire highway was raised to from the previous speed limit. The increase followed a study that found 85% of drivers on the highway already drove between .

In 2019, construction started on a new interchange between SR 429 (Wekiva Parkway), SR 417, and Interstate 4, and was completed in 2024 to finish the beltway around Orlando.

==Future==
The OOCEA 2030 Master Plan suggested widening the entire expressway to six lanes from International Drive to the Seminole County line. Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise has also completed a project development &amp; environment study (PD&amp;E) to evaluate the widening of the Seminole Expressway, the portion of SR 417 north of University Boulevard. Construction between University Boulevard and SR 434 was scheduled to begin in 2020, but hasn&#x27;t started yet as of 2023.

<doc id="766643" wikidata="Q1023044" url="?curid=766643" title="Akmenė">
<text>Akmenė () is a city in northern Lithuania.

Following the discovery of large reserves of limestone and clay in the region, in 1947 construction work began on one of the largest cement production complexes in the Baltic States. Nearby, a new town grew up which was to become the region&#x27;s administrative centre: Naujoji Akmenė (&quot;New Akmenė&quot;).

== Name ==

Most probably the name is derived from a rivulet that flows north of the town: the Akmenupis (approximate meaning – &quot;river with a lot of stones&quot;). Foreign renderings include: German: &quot;Akmene&quot;, Yiddish: אַקמיאַן/&quot;Akmian&quot;, Polish: &quot;Okmiany&quot;, Russian: Окмяны/&quot;Okmiany&quot;. Up to 17th century the place was known as &quot;Dabikinė&quot;.

== History ==

Akmenė is first mentioned as an estate owned by the Kęsgaila family circa 1511.
In 1531 a privilege was granted by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old to build a town, named Dabikinė near te Dabikinė River. It was built in Wallach reform style. The town grew fast, and by the time there were 3 streets, 82 households and 28 inns in 1561. In 1596 Grand Duchess of Lithuania Anna Jagiellon founded a wooden church.

City rights were granted to Akmenė in 1592.

The city was devastated and burned down in 1705 during the Swedish occupation after a nearby battle. A plague of 1710–1711 left the city without inhabitants, although it recovered fast, and in 1754 received a privilege to hold a market and four fairs per year. In 1792 Akmenė city rights were reconfirmed and a coat of arms was granted.

After the Partitions of Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth the neighborhoods were donated to the wife of Russian General Fitinhof.

==The Jewish community==

According to the records Jews arrived in Akmenė in the eighteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century the majority of the population in the town was Jewish. The first mass migration of Jews followed the notorious May Laws of 1881. Many of the Jews who left in the face of increasing Tsarist persecution settled in Cork, Ireland, where Jews today still refer to themselves as Akmianers.

In 1915, some of the Jews were expelled into the Russian interior.

By 1939 the Jewish community had fallen in number to around 30 families. At the end of June 1941, following the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, Jewish people were arrested. The Rollkommando Hamann with the help of local collaborators, shot and killed three Jews, and on August 4, 1941, all the remaining prisoners were transferred to three silos on the bank of the river Venta, near Mažeikiai. The men were taken immediately to dig pits and the women were imprisoned in Mažeikiai together with other Jewish women prisoners. All of them were murdered together with the Jews of Mažeikiai and the surroundings on August 9, 1941.

<text>Walther Heinrich Alfred Hermann von Brauchitsch (4 October 1881 – 18 October 1948) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) and Commander-in-Chief (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber&quot;) of the German Army during the first two years of World War II. Born into an aristocratic military family, he entered army service in 1901. During World War I, he served with distinction on the corps-level and division-level staff on the Western Front.

After the 1933 Nazi seizure of power, Brauchitsch was put in charge of &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; I, the East Prussian military district. He borrowed immense sums of money from Adolf Hitler and became dependent on his financial help. Brauchitsch served as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army from February 1938 to December 1941. He played a key role in the Battle of France and oversaw the German invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece. For his part in the Battle of France, he became one of twelve generals promoted to field marshal.

After suffering a heart attack in November 1941 and being blamed by Hitler for the failure of Operation Typhoon, the Wehrmacht&#x27;s attack on Moscow, Brauchitsch was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief. He spent the rest of the war in enforced retirement.

After the war, Brauchitsch was arrested on charges of war crimes, but he died of pneumonia in 1948 before he could be prosecuted.

==Early life==
Brauchitsch was born in Berlin on 4 October 1881 as the sixth child of , a cavalry general, and his wife, Charlotte Bertha von Gordon. The Brauchitsch family had a long tradition of military service, and like his forefathers, Brauchitsch was raised in the tradition of the Prussian officer corps. His family moved in the leading social circles of Berlin&#x27;s high society, and his family name and father&#x27;s military rank put him on equal footing with any officer or official. In his teens, Brauchitsch was interested in politics and was fascinated by art. To help him pursue these interests, his father enrolled him at Französisches Gymnasium Berlin rather than a military academy.

In 1895 Brauchitsch joined the military academy in Potsdam. He later transferred to the &quot;Hauptkadettenanstalt Groß Lichterfelde&quot;, where in his final year he belonged to the top class for gifted students and was chosen, like his brother Adolf five years before, as a page by Empress Augusta Victoria. During his time serving the empress at court, he learned manners and bearing that were noted for the rest of his life.

Upon graduation in 1900 he received his commission as a lieutenant in an infantry regiment. Alternative sources suggest that upon graduation he became a lieutenant in the Royal Elizabeth Guard Grenadiers but got himself transferred from this &quot;socialite outfit&quot; to the Third Field Artillery Regiment. A medical condition made him unfit for service in the infantry, so he was transferred to an artillery regiment. He was put in charge of training recruits in riding and driving. He then joined the General Staff office in Berlin, where he was promoted to first lieutenant in 1909.

==World War I==
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Brauchitsch had reached the rank of captain. He was appointed staff officer to the XVI Army Corps, stationed near Metz. During World War I, he served with the 34th Infantry Division and Guards Reserve Corps. Between 1914 and 1916, he took part in the Battle of Verdun and Battle of the Argonne Forest. In the remaining two years of the conflict, Brauchitsch took part in the Third Battle of the Aisne, the Aisne-Marne offensive, the Second Battle of the Aisne, the Battle of Armentières, and the Battle of Flanders. Brauchitsch was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and the House Order of Hohenzollern, and ended the war with the rank of major.

==Weimar Republic==
In 1918, together with thousands of other officers, he was dismissed to the Reserve Corps. But the next year he was back as a major. The German military underwent a forced reduction in 1919 to comply with the Treaty of Versailles, but Brauchitsch managed to remain in service. He remained with the General Staff, where he had no opportunity to use his knowledge of artillery. Eventually, in 1920, he was permitted to transfer to the staff of the 2nd Artillery Regiment. The following year, he worked in the Ministry of the Reichswehr, in the Artillery Department.

Brauchitsch&#x27;s assignment in the Artillery Department was to reorganize artillery formations and implement lessons learned in the closing months of the war. He added ideas of his own, including modifying the classification system for light, medium, and heavy artillery. Heavy artillery, formerly known as &quot;corps artillery&quot;, now became &quot;reinforcement artillery&quot;. He also added emphasis on the combination and cooperation between artillery and infantry.

After three years in the Artillery Department, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1925. As of 1 November 1927, Brauchitsch was appointed Chief of Staff of the 6th Infantry Division in Münster, Westphalia, one of the strongest garrisons in the west of Germany. In the last years of the Weimar Republic, he took over the Army Training Department and became a colonel (promoted in 1928). In October 1931, Brauchitsch received his major general promotion.

==Nazi Germany==
In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power and began to expand the military, in order to realize Hitler&#x27;s military ambitions. On 1 February 1933, Brauchitsch was named commander of the East Prussian military district (Wehrkreis I) and chief of the 1st Division in Königsberg. As a consequence of the German re-armament the command position &quot;Befehlshaber im Wehrkreis&quot; I (Commander of the 1st military district) was expanded. Brauchitsch was promoted to lieutenant general in October 1933. The staff of the 1st Division formed the staff of the 1st Army Corps and Brauchitsch was appointed its first commanding general on 21 June 1935.

Although Brauchitsch felt at home in Prussia, he had a clash with Erich Koch, the local &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (party head and de facto head of civil administration of the province). Koch was known as something of a crook who greatly enjoyed the power he possessed, and who would bring violence to his enemies. As neither Koch nor Brauchitsch wanted to lose their jobs in the region, the two attempted to keep their feud unofficial. As a result, Berlin hardly learned of their dispute.

A dispute emerged a few years later when Brauchitsch learned that &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler planned to replace the army guards in East Prussia with SS men, with the purpose of persecuting Jews, Protestant and Catholic churches in the district. Even though Brauchitsch managed to prevent the SS replacement of the army troops in the region, Himmler categorized him as &quot;a junker&quot;, and informed Hitler of the disagreement. Brauchitsch claimed he had done his duty, saying laconically, &quot;Civilians are not allowed to enter that area.&quot;

Brauchitsch obtained the rank of general of artillery in 1936. When the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Werner von Fritsch, was accused of homosexuality, Hitler promoted Brauchitsch to colonel general and appointed him the new army chief on the recommendation of the Army High Command on 4 February 1938. At the time of this promotion Brauchitsch was also granted cabinet-level rank and authority, though not the formal title of &quot;Reichsminister&quot;. The homosexual allegations were in reality a trap set by Hitler as an excuse to dismiss one of the aristocratic senior officers within the Army High Command. Fritsch&#x27;s removal was a severe test of the stability of the German internal administration of that time.

Brauchitsch welcomed the Nazi policy of rearmament. The relationship between Hitler and Brauchitsch improved during Brauchitsch&#x27;s confusion about whether to leave his wife for his mistress, in the middle of the Munich Crisis; Hitler set aside his usual anti-divorce sentiments and encouraged Brauchitsch to divorce and remarry. Hitler even lent him 80,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; so he could afford the divorce. Over time, Brauchitsch became largely reliant on Hitler for financial help.

Like Colonel General Ludwig Beck, Brauchitsch opposed Hitler&#x27;s annexation of Austria and intervention in Czechoslovakia, although he did not resist Hitler&#x27;s plans for war, again preferring to refrain from politics. Yet in April 1939 Brauchitsch, together with Colonel General Wilhelm Keitel, was awarded the Golden Party Badge by Hitler in commemoration of the occupation of Czechoslovakia.

In the final months before World War II, Brauchitsch focused on Italy&#x27;s potential to aid the Nazi military cause. In May 1939 he inspected the Italian military installations in Libya, and La Spezia, to affirm Italo-German alliance. However, this turned out not to be an easy task, as the Italian leader Benito Mussolini expected economic support from the Reich in return for his military collaboration. Fritsch had already told Brauchitsch that the Italian military was in &quot;extremely poor fighting shape&quot;. Joachim von Ribbentrop, Germany&#x27;s Foreign Minister and the main architect of the Axis alliance, constantly interfered with Brauchitsch&#x27;s efforts, as he wanted to see his work consolidated at all costs.

==World War II==
During the invasion of Poland, Brauchitsch oversaw most plans. The Polish campaign was often cited as the first example of &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, but blitzkrieg was not a theory or an official doctrine. The campaign did not resemble the popular perception of what became known as blitzkrieg. The Panzer divisions were spread thinly among the infantry and were not granted operational independence or grouped &quot;en masse&quot;, as they would be in the 1940 invasion of Western Europe. The operative method of the Wehrmacht in Poland followed the more traditional &quot;Vernichtungsgedanke&quot;. What is commonly referred to as blitzkrieg did not develop until after the campaign in the west in June 1940. It was not the cause but rather the consequence of victory. Brauchitsch himself had to be convinced that armour could act independently at the operational level, before the campaign.

Brauchitsch supported harsh measures against the Polish population, which he claimed were needed for securing German &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;). He had a central role in the death sentences for Polish prisoners taken in the defence of the Polish Post Office in Danzig, rejecting the clemency appeal.

===Invasion of Western Europe and the Balkans===

By early November 1939, Brauchitsch and Chief of the General Staff Franz Halder started to consider overthrowing Hitler, who had fixed &quot;X-day&quot;, the invasion of France, as 12 November 1939. Both officers believed that the invasion was doomed to fail. On 5 November 1939, the Army General Staff prepared a special memorandum purporting to recommend against launching an attack on the Western powers that year. Brauchitsch reluctantly agreed to read the document to Hitler and did so in a meeting on 5 November. Brauchitsch attempted to talk Hitler into putting off X-day by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than in 1918. Brauchitsch went on to complain: &quot;The aggressive spirit of the German infantry is sadly below the standard of the First World War ... [there have been] certain symptoms of insubordination similar to those of 1917–18.&quot;

Hitler flew into a rage, accusing the General Staff and Brauchitsch personally of disloyalty, cowardice, sabotage, and defeatism. He returned to the army headquarters at Zossen, where he &quot;arrived in such poor shape that at first he could only give a somewhat incoherent account of the proceedings.&quot; After that meeting, both Brauchitsch and Halder told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a key leader of the anti-Nazi movement, that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do and that he should find other officers to take part in the plot. Hitler called a meeting of the General Staff, where he declared that he would smash the West within a year. He also vowed to &quot;destroy the spirit of Zossen&quot;, a threat that panicked Halder to such an extent that he forced the conspirators to abort their second planned coup attempt. On 7 November, following heavy snowstorms, Hitler put off X-Day until further notice, which removed Brauchitsch and Halder&#x27;s primary motivation for the plot.
While preparations were underway for the Battle of France, General Erich von Manstein, then serving as chief of staff of Army Group A, produced his famous &quot;Sichelschnitt&quot; (&quot;sickle cut&quot;) plan. Brauchitsch and Halder did not approve of &quot;Sichelschnitt&quot;. When Manstein demanded that &quot;Sichelschnitt&quot; be presented to OKH, Halder suggested transferring Manstein somewhere to the east, excluding him from the planning process. Brauchitsch agreed and transferred him to Silesia. However, Hitler invited a group of officers to lunch, and Manstein was among them. He managed to present his plan directly to Hitler. The following day, Hitler ordered Brauchitsch to accept Manstein&#x27;s plan, which the Führer presented as his own. Despite his original scepticism, Brauchitsch eventually saw the plan&#x27;s potential and felt that the army had a real chance of success in France.

After the surprisingly swift fall of France, Brauchitsch was promoted to field marshal in July 1940, during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. After France had been occupied and divided, he and the rest of the high command were looking forward to a similarly easy and swift campaign against Great Britain, now seriously weakened by the French campaign. He was confident that Britain would be easily defeated: &quot;We consider the victory already won. England remains secure, but only so long as we choose.&quot; Had Operation Sealion, the plan for the invasion of Britain, succeeded, Hitler intended to place Brauchitsch in charge of the new conquest. As the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; could not gain the requisite air superiority, the Battle of Britain was lost and so the plan was shelved and eventually cancelled.

In the swift invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece in early April 1941, the Germans committed some 337,000 men, 2,000 mortars, 1,500 artillery pieces, 1,100 anti-tank guns, 875 tanks and 740 other armoured fighting vehicles, all of which were under the overall command of Brauchitsch. By the end of the month, all of Yugoslavia and Greece were in German hands.

===Operation Barbarossa===

Brauchitsch ordered his army and commanders to cease criticism of racist Nazi policies, as harsh measures were needed for the &quot;forthcoming battle of destiny of the German people&quot;. When Germany turned East and invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he again played a key part, making modifications to the original plan. Like his friend and colleague, Wilhelm Keitel, Brauchitsch did not protest when Hitler gave the German army the same instructions as the SS on whom to kill in the occupied territory, but he later issued a series of decrees that ordered that Commissars were to be shot only if their anti-German sentiments were &quot;especially recognizable&quot;.

As the Battle of Moscow got underway, his health was starting to fail. Even so, he continued his work, as he was determined to take Moscow before the start of winter. The army&#x27;s failure to take Moscow earned him Hitler&#x27;s enmity, and things worsened for him, as he suffered a heart attack in November. He was also informed that he had a malignant cardiac disease, most likely incurable.

=== Dismissal ===

In the aftermath of the failed offensive at Moscow, Brauchitsch was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on 19 December and transferred to the &quot;Führerreserve&quot; (officers reserve), where he remained without assignment until the end of the war; he never saw Hitler again. He spent the last three years of the war living at his castle-like hunting lodge &quot;Dreiröhren&quot; in the Brdy mountains southwest of Prague. One of his few public comments after retirement was a statement condemning the 20 July plot against Hitler for which he denounced several former colleagues. Later, he excused himself to Halder, claiming he had been forced to do so to save a relative&#x27;s life.

==Postwar confinement and death==
In August 1945, Brauchitsch was arrested at his estate and imprisoned by the British at Island Farm in South Wales and later transferred to a British military hospital in Münsterlager. He was held until August 1948, when the British government announced that he would be brought to trial before a British military tribunal in the British occupation zone, most likely in Hamburg. However, he died, aged 67, on 18 October 1948 of bronchial pneumonia in a British-controlled military hospital in Hamburg before facing trial for conspiracy and crimes against humanity.

==Personal life==
In 1910, Brauchitsch married his first wife, Elizabeth von Karstedt, a wealthy heiress to in Brandenburg. The couple had a daughter and two sons, including Bernd von Brauchitsch, who later served in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II as Hermann Göring&#x27;s adjutant. They were divorced in 1938 after 28 years of marriage, as Brauchitsch had developed another romantic interest.

In 1925, Brauchitsch met Charlotte Rueffer, the daughter of a Silesian judge. He wanted a divorce, but his wife refused. Rueffer later married a bank director named Schmidt, who drowned in his bath during a visit to Berlin. When Brauchitsch returned from East Prussia in 1937, the pair resumed their affair. They married immediately after Brauchitsch had divorced Karstedt.

Brauchitsch was the uncle of Manfred von Brauchitsch, a 1930s Mercedes-Benz &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; Grand Prix driver, and also Hans Bernd von Haeften and Werner von Haeften, who were members of the German resistance against Hitler.

==Assessment==

Historian Helmut Krausnick characterizes Brauchitsch as &quot;an outstanding professional who lived up to the traditions of his profession, but especially lacked the strength of personality to deal with Hitler&quot;. Historian Ian Kershaw describes him less sympathetically as a &quot;spineless individual, who was frightened by Hitler. He was no person to lead any type of front or revolt.&quot;

<text>Denizli Province () () is a province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey in Western Anatolia, on high ground above the Aegean coast. Neighbouring provinces are Uşak to the north, Burdur, Isparta, Afyon to the east, Aydın, Manisa to the west and Muğla to the south. It is located between the coordinates 28° 30’ and 29° 30’ E and 37° 12’ and 38° 12’ N. Its area is 12,134 km2, and its population is 1,056,332 (2022). The provincial capital is the city of Denizli.

== Districts ==


== Geography ==

Approximately 28-30% of the land is plain, 25% is high plateau and tableland, and 47% is mountainous. At 2571m Mount Honaz is the highest in the province, and indeed in Western Anatolia. Babadag in the Mentes range has a height of 2308 meters. The biggest lake in Denizli is Acıgöl, which means &quot;bitter lake&quot; and indeed industrial salts (sodium sulphate) are extracted from this lake which is highly alkaline. There is a thermal spring to the west of Sarayköy, at the source of the Great Menderes River, which contains bicarbonates and sulfates. There is another hot spring in Kızıldere which reaches 200˚C.
A geothermal steam source was first found in the region in 1965 during drilling work. Today there is a power plant producing electricity from the geothermal steam. Only 11% of the geothermal energy source is used to produce electricity and 89% of it, which flows into the Great Menderes, is 150˚C at source (it is contains energy equal to 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of fuel oil).

=== Climate ===
In general the Aegean region has a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures can rise to 40 °C during summer and fall to -5 °C in winter. There are about 80 days with precipitation, mainly during winter.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

There are traces of prehistoric cultures throughout the province, including evidence of pre-Hittite cultures and the Hittites themselves. The Hittites were followed by Phrygians, Lydians and Persians, and then cities founded by the ancient Greeks and Alexander the Great. The first real settlement was the city of Laodicea on the Lycus which was established by King Antiochus II for his wife Laodice. Laodicea is located 6 km north of the city of Denizli.
The city of Hierapolis was established around 190 BC by the Pergamene Kingdom, one of the Hellenistic states of Anatolia. The calcified terraces and pools of Pamukkale (&quot;Cotton Castle&quot;) now stand below the ruins of Hierapolis. The two cities, Laodicea and Hierapolis later came under Roman rule, and with the division of the Empire in 395 were left within the boundaries of the East Roman Empire.

=== Christian era ===
The province has strong biblical connections: in the Book of Revelation, John the Evangelist hears a loud voice which sounded like a trumpet when he was on the island of Patmos. The voice says: &quot;Write down what you see and send the book to the Churches in these seven cities: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea&quot;. The Church of Laodicea was a sacred place even in pre-Christian times, and is still visited by Christians today, although it lost its importance to a great extent during Byzantine rule.

=== Turkish era ===
Turks were first seen in Denizli in 1070 when Afşin Bey, under the control of the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan, raided the area. The second and third Crusades fought here against the Seljuk Turks under the command of Kazıkbeli, who managed to flee with a small force to Antalya which was also captured by the Crusaders. Later, after the Turks had established control of the ancient cities, they moved south to the site of the present city of Denizli, where drinking water was brought through stone pipes. The name Laodicea slowly changed into “Ladik” then since the 17th century other names were given “Tonguzlu”, ”Tonuzlu”, ”Tenguzlug”, ”Donuzlu” and finally “Denizli”.
After World War I, when the Greek Army captured the city of İzmir on May 15, 1919, one of the first centres of Turkish resistance formed at an open-air meeting in Denizli. A Turkish militia formed lines on the Menderes organized by Yörük Ali Efe and Demirci Efe, involving large numbers of volunteers from the local peasantry. Stiffened by the Turkish regular army, Greek forces were repelled, and Denizli remained in Turkish hands throughout the Greco-Turkish War.

<doc id="766672" wikidata="Q32429" url="?curid=766672" title="Jhelum District">
<text>Jhelum District () is a district, located partially on the Pothohar Plateau and in Indus Plain, in Punjab, Pakistan. Jhelum is one of the oldest districts of Punjab. It was established on 23 March 1849. Jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the British and later to the Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as &#x27;city of soldiers&#x27; or &#x27;land of martyrs and warriors&#x27;. The district of Jhelum stretches from the river Jhelum almost to the Indus. Salt is quarried at the Mayo mine in the Salt Range. There are two coal mines in the district from which the North-Western railway obtains parts of its supply. These are the only coal mines in Punjab province which are in working condition. The chief center of the salt trade is Pind Dadan Khan. The district is crossed by the main line of the North-Western railway and also traversed along the south by a branch line. It is located in the north of the Punjab province, Jhelum district is bordered by Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin to its south, Khushab to its southwest, Jhelum River to its south and east, Gujrat to its east, Chakwal to its west, Mirpur to its northeast, and Rawalpindi to its north.

==Administration==
The district of Jhelum, which covers an area of , Jhelum City is the main city of the district. District is administratively divided into following tehsils:
==History==

===Early history===
The history of the district dates back to the Hindu mythological period of the Mahabharata. The epic represents the Salt Range as the refuge of the five Pandava brethren during the period of their exile, and every salient point in its scenery is connected with some legend of the national heroes. Modern research has fixed the site of the conflict between Alexander and Porus as within Jhelum district, though the exact spot at which the Macedonian king affected the passage of the Jhelum (or Hydaspes) has been hotly disputed. The Panhwars, Janjuas and Jats, who now hold the Salt Range and its northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants.

The Janjuas, who appear to represent the oldest breed of Punjab and who still inhabit a large tract in the east of the District; while the Awans and Ghakars who cluster in the western plain, are apparently later invaders, the Janjuas were the dominant race during the before and early Muslim era and they long continued to retain their independence until the time of Sikh invaders, both in Jhelum itself and in the neighboring District of Rawalpindi.

===Sultanate era===

In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of northern Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region, which is also reflected in Jhelum.

===British era===
During British rule, Jhelum was a district of Rawalpindi Division, and was larger than the current district of Jhelum. On 1 April 1904, the tehsil of Talagang was detached from the District and incorporated with the new District of Attock. According to the Gazetteer of the Jhelum District of 1904, 88.7% of the population were Muslim.

The old Jhelum district (minus Talagang) covered an area of 2,813 square miles (7285 km2) and included Chakwal Tehsil – it was bordered by Shahpur and Attock to the west, and by Rawalpindi to the north – the Jhelum River separated it from Kashmir to the north-east and from Gujrat and Shahpur to the south-east and south.

==Independence==
The predominantly Muslim population supported under the leadership of Raja Ghazanfar Ali khan of PD Khan Muslim League and Partition of India. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Jhelum District.

Since independence the agriculture and industry of Jhelum developed and forms part of the economy of Pakistan.

==Topography==
===Jhelum City===

The district capital, Jhelum City, is situated on the right and left bank of the Jhelum River, the left side of Jhelum is known as Sarai Alamgir and it also contains the Military College Jhelum (MCJ). The 16th-century Grand Trunk Road passes through the city. Jhelum city is near the site of the Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander and Porus This battle took place a few miles downstream from the city center, along the river banks. Population of the Jhelum city (proper) is about 172,073 (2009) and it is the 35th largest city of Pakistan by population. A cantonment was built during the British rule, which has grown up into a strong Garrison, with an Infantry Division commanded by a Major General.

===River Jhelum===

The river Jhelum is navigable throughout the district, which forms the south-eastern portion of a rugged Himalayan spur, extending between the Indus and Jhelum to the borders of the Sind Sagar Doab. Its scenery is very picturesque, although not of so wild a character as the mountain region of Rawalpindi to the north, and is lighted up in places by smiling patches of the cultivated valley. The backbone of the district is formed by the Salt Range, a treble line of parallel hills running in three long forks from east to west throughout its whole breadth.

The range rises in precipices, broken by gorges, clothed with brushwood, and traversed by streams which are at first clear but become impregnated with the saline matter over which they pass. Between the line of hills lies a table-land, in which the small lake of Kallar Kahar nestles amongst the minor ridges. North of the Salt Range, the country extends upwards in an elevated plateau, diversified by a number of ravines and fissures, until it loses itself in tangled masses of Rawalpindi mountains. In this rugged tract, cultivation is rare and difficult, the soil being choked with saline matter. At the foot of the Salt Range, however, a small strip of level soil lies along the banks of the Jhelum and is dotted with prosperous villages.

The drainage of the district is determined by a low central watershed running north and south at right angles to the Salt Range. The waters of the western portion find their way into the Sohan, and finally into the Indus; those of the opposite slope collect themselves into small torrents and empty themselves into the Jhelum River.

===Khewra Salt Mine===
The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) is located in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an administrative subdivision of Jhelum District, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan&#x27;s largest and oldest salt mine and the world&#x27;s second largest. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 40,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander&#x27;s troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite.

Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.

===Tilla Jogian===
Tilla Jogian is the highest peak in the Eastern Salt Range. At 975 meters (3200 ft) above sea level, it is about 25 km to the west of Jhelum City and 10 km west of the model village of Khukha. The view from the top of Tilla is highly rewarding. Rohtas Fort is located to the east of Tilla Jogian at a distance of about 7 km from Dina, a rapidly expanding town on the Grand Trunk Road.

===Rohtas Fort===

Rohtas Fort (Qila Rohtas) is a historical garrison fort located near the city of Jhelum. It was built by Raja Todar Mal, under the orders of the Afghan king Sher Shah Suri, to subdue the rebellious tribes of the northern Punjab region, in the 16th century. This fort is about 4 km in circumference. The Rohtas fort was built to crush the local Gakhar tribes of Potohar, who rebelled against the Sur dynasty after the Mughal emperor Humayun was ousted by the former.

It took eight years to build the fort, it was captured by Mughal emperor Humayun in 1555. Nader Shah, the Turkic ruler of Persia, Afghan ruler Ahmed Shah Abdali and the Maratha army also camped here during their respective campaigns in the Punjab region. Rohtas was also occasionally used for administrative purposes by Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire, after he captured it in 1825.

==Agriculture==

Jhelum District has a total area of , out of which are cultivated. The area is located on the eastern part of Potohar upland along with River Jhelum.

Agriculture in the District Jhelum depends mainly on rainfall. The average rainfall of the area varies from 20 to . About three-fourths of this precipitation is received in monsoon season and the remaining one-fourth is received during the rest of the year. The irrigated area at present is limited but the emphasis on the construction of small dams is gradually increasing. Wheat remains the main crop.

In Tehsil P.D. Khan, salt is the predominant feature that is spoiling the rich agricultural land day by day. There is a long strip of very rich and virgin soil along the river which could be made a paradise of citrus plantation by drip irrigation if the local people are motivated and the Government of Punjab expressed some interest in it.

==Sports==

The main sports of the area are centred on agricultural pursuits and excellence and include &quot;bugdar&quot; (stone) lifting by young men. A localised version of kabaddi, bull races centered on a Persian water wheel at the villages of Kantrili, Nathwala, and Jada near the suburban town of Kala Gujran. &quot;Tent pegging&quot; also known as &quot;neza bazi&quot; which indicates the region&#x27;s prowess during war and battle and hence the city has attributed the name of the land of martyrs and warriors. Zamir Jaffri Cricket Stadium near Suleiman Park is named after Zamir Jafri, a poet from Jhelum. Hockey is another sport that is common in Jhelum.

==Flora and fauna==

Vegetation of the forests of Jhelum Forest Division is dry, deciduous shrub type, phulai, Kahu (wild olive), and sanatha are the main species. The stocking, on the whole, is poor and the forests are open. Vegetation is poor on sandstone and red marl. The southern slopes are often devoid of vegetation while northwestern slopes carry good forests. The forests of Jhelum Forests Division are burdened with the right of grazing, browsing, and firewood. Under settlement out of total area only about (45%) are right free. The remaining 55% are open to grazing.

The fauna of the district is mostly indigenous restricted, like the vegetation, but similarly varied and interesting. The rugged and rough terrain, low rainfall, the scantly cover of vegetation, and the burning passions of the increasing number of hunters, all have their share in limiting the animal kingdom in the district. The river offers a better environment than elsewhere though the hills support more interesting wildlife. Urial (an animal from a deer family) and chinckara are spot aids while wild boar are found in the Salt Range. Wolves, foxes, and wild cats are also found. Hare is fairly common. Chikor grey and black partridge are also found in the parts of the district. Migratory ducks like teal pintail and mallard and some geese visit during winter.

==Climate==
The climate of the tract is extreme. In winter it is very cold and summer is very hot. The average rainfall varies from 48 to 69 m.m per annum which is much below the required quantity but in the rainy season, the water torrents flow from north to the river Jhelum at a very fast speed and cause damages to the crops, bridges, roads, and are responsible for the soil erosion in the District.

Over the years, global climate change has affected Jhelum as well as any other place on Earth and below comparison charts from Weatherbase show the difference in climate between 2008 and 2015:

<text>Richard Dale Kotzen Jr. (born February 3, 1970) is an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. As a solo artist, Kotzen has a back catalogue of more than 20 album releases. He was signed to California-based Shrapnel Records from 1988 to 1991, and again from 1995 to 1997. He was a member of glam metal band Poison from 1991 to 1993, Mr. Big from 1999 to 2002, and since 2012, has been the frontman of the band The Winery Dogs. 

==Biography==
Kotzen began playing piano at the age of five. At the age of seven, he was inspired to learn the electric guitar, by the band Kiss. He started his career in a band named Arthur&#x27;s Museum. Kotzen was eventually discovered by Shrapnel Records&#x27; Mike Varney, and he recorded his first solo album by the age of 19, the first of two instrumental records, simply entitled &quot;Richie Kotzen&quot;. He created the video &quot;Rock Chops&quot; for REH video in 1989, highlighting many of his formative techniques, including using wide-intervals and fluid sweeping. One year later, a second solo album called &quot;Fever Dream&quot; was released, which was the first one to also feature his lead vocals. Since then, Kotzen has released a long series of more than twenty albums with musical influences ranging from rock, hard rock, pop, blues, blue-eyed-soul, R&amp;B and funk to jazz fusion.

In 1991, at age 21, Kotzen joined glam metal band Poison, co-writing and performing on the album &quot;Native Tongue&quot;. This album produced two top-twenty singles which Kotzen co-wrote, &quot;Stand&quot; and &quot;Until You Suffer Some (Fire and Ice)&quot;. Kotzen was fired from Poison in 1993 when it was discovered that he had become romantically involved with Rockett&#x27;s then-fiancée Deanna Eve,

Kotzen then focused on his solo career, regularly releasing song oriented, R&amp;B/soul/blues and funk influenced melodic rock albums. He also made guest appearances on several albums by artists like Glenn Hughes, Stevie Salas and T.M. Stevens. In 1995 and 1997 he collaborated with Greg Howe on two jazz rock fusion albums.

In 1999, Kotzen replaced Paul Gilbert as guitarist in the mainstream hard rock band Mr. Big, performing on their album &quot;Get Over It.&quot; He also contributed guitars and songwriting to their subsequent release &quot;Actual Size&quot;. The record included the Kotzen song &quot;Shine&quot;.

In 2001, while still in Mr. Big, Kotzen recorded and released another solo album called &quot;Slow&quot;, which contains a mix of bluesy rock for which a music video was filmed. On some of the songs on &quot;Slow&quot; Kotzen experimented with the use of a drum computer, while on others he played drums. After Mr. Big disbanded in 2002, Kotzen continued his solo career, and didn&#x27;t return when the band was reformed in 2009, with Gilbert returned on guitars. He released his next solo album &quot;Change&quot;, in 2003.

In 2002, Kotzen established a recording studio and production company. He has since produced his own albums and collaborated with various figures in rock (e.g. Gene Simmons), jazz and fusion, including jazz legend Stanley Clarke, with whom he realized the project Vertú.

The 2004, follow-up-album to &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;Get Up&quot; featured a more edgy, aggressive rock sound. It was more hard rock oriented than any of his previous solo outputs since &quot;Fever Dream&quot; and contains the ballad &quot;Remember&quot;.

In 2005, Kotzen teamed up with three Japanese punk rockers to form the short-lived Forty Deuce-Project, which only lasted long enough to record and release one album.

Later in the same year, Kotzen collaborated with Funk Rock Fusion guitarist Steve Saluto on his album &quot;Rough Beat.&quot;

In 2006, Kotzen was the opening act for The Rolling Stones in Japan on their Bigger Bang tour.

During the year 2006, Kotzen produced and released two solo studio albums, first &quot;Ai Senshi Z×R&quot;, an album on which he played several English sung rock covers of theme songs from the Japanese &quot;Gundam&quot; anime franchise, and only nine months later &quot;Into the Black&quot;, containing ten self-penned rock songs

In 2007, &quot;Go Faster&quot; was released, which alternatively was named &quot;Return of the Mother Head&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot; in Europe and Japan. It includes the eight-minute-song &quot;Fooled Again&quot;, and the soft pop ballad &quot;Chase It&quot;, for which a music video clip was filmed in Venice.

In 2008, Kotzen&#x27;s first live album, simply entitled &quot;Live in São Paulo&quot; was released, followed by the acclaimed &quot;Peace Sign&quot; album in 2009, for which Kotzen played and recorded all instruments.

In 2009, Kotzen also teamed up with songwriter/producer Richie Zito for a short-lived project they called Wilson Hawk. Wilson Hawk produced one album called &quot;The Road&quot;, on which they celebrate some R&amp;B and soul influenced pop music in the style of the late 60s and 70s and many soulful pop ballads.

After the &quot;Peace Sign&quot; world tour, Kotzen released one single in 2010, &quot;Angry Boy.&quot;

In 2011, Kotzen released a full-length Solo album titled &quot;24 Hours.&quot; The release was followed by another tour.

In 2012, he joined forces with Mike Portnoy and Billy Sheehan to form the rock supergroup The Winery Dogs who released their self-titled debut album on May 15, 2013, in Japan, with a worldwide release on July 23 of the same year. A world tour followed.

After that, Kotzen went on an acoustic solo tour and started working on his 20th solo effort, which became the &quot;Cannibals&quot; album, that was released on January, 5th, 2015. &quot;Cannibals&quot; features a more relaxed, and often R&amp;B influenced rock/pop sound. Kotzen&#x27;s wife, bassist/vocalist Julia Lage, added some background vocals and also appears in the music video for the song &quot;In An Instant&quot;. On the song &quot;I&#x27;m All In&quot; Kotzen shares the vocals with Doug Pinnick of King&#x27;s X 

Only nine months later, on October 2, 2015, The Winery Dogs released their second album &quot;Hot Streak&quot;, followed by another world tour.

By the end of 2016, The Winery Dogs went on hiatus and Kotzen focused on his next solo record &quot;Salting Earth&quot;, which came out on April 14, 2017. The album incorporates a mix of blues rock and laid back pop/rock songs. From August until late September Kotzen completed a European tour.

On January 25, 2018, Kotzen released a video for his new single called &quot;The Damned&quot;, a heavy blues rocker, via YouTube, which was filmed at Paramount Ranch in Agoura, California by director Vicente Cordero. On June 5, 2018, a second video single called &quot;Riot&quot; was released via YouTube, which was again directed by Vicente Cordero. On December 11, 2018, Kotzen announced a Winery Dogs Tour through the US for May 2019, via his official Facebook page, which they completed successfully then.

On June 11, 2019, another solo single titled &quot;Venom&quot; was published, in the style of The Winery Dogs, accompanied by a music video.

For his 50th birthday in 2020, Kotzen wanted to offer his fans something special. This resulted in the 50-track triple-album titled &quot;50 for 50&quot;. For the song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hand&quot;, a video clip was filmed by the seaside, which was again directed by Vicente Cordero, and also includes scenes with Kotzen&#x27;s wife, Julia Lage. Another music video for the song &quot;As You Are&quot; was shot by Kotzen himself, dancing and playing in his kitchen wearing a pajama, while he was in quarantine with COVID-19.

In the second half of 2020, Kotzen began working on a project called Smith/Kotzen with Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith. Nine songs were created and appear on the eponymous album. The album was released on March 26, 2021, and was produced by Smith and Kotzen and mixed by Kevin Shirley.

On November 26, 2021, Smith/Kotzen released a four-track EP titled &quot;Better Days&quot;.

In January 2022, they went on a club tour through California (US), with a UK tour following in February and March. Kotzen&#x27;s wife, Julia Lage, took over on bass guitar. In June 2024 Kotzen toured Europe and played at the Sweden Rock Festival.

==Guitar playing style==

Kotzen has described his style as a mix of rock, blues, heavy metal, jazz, fusion, and soul music. Kotzen utilizes a heavy amount of legato and sweeping in his playing. As his main influences, he lists Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eddie Van Halen, Jason Becker (who produced his first album), Allan Holdsworth, and many other jazz and fusion players. Kotzen, since around 2007, has opted to stop using guitar picks and been playing exclusively with his fingers ever since.

==Instruments and equipment==
Kotzen has used Fender electric guitars for most of his career, most notably his signature model Telecasters and Stratocasters, as well as other custom-made models. Currently, there are two Richie Kotzen signature models made by Fender Japan – a Stratocaster (STR-145RK) and a Telecaster (TLR-155RK). Both guitars feature ash bodies with laminated flame maple caps, maple necks and one piece maple fretboards with abalone dot inlays and 22 super jumbo frets. The Telecaster model features a DiMarzio Chopper T pickup in the bridge position (single-spaced humbucker) and a DiMarzio Twang King in the neck position. The Stratocaster is fitted with three custom made DiMarzio single coil pickups.

At the beginning of his career, Kotzen used Ibanez guitars and Laney amplifiers before switching to Fender guitars and Marshall amplifiers in the early 1990s. He used Marshall Super Lead, JCM800 and JCM900 models as well as Yamaha DG Series amps in the late 1990s. Yamaha DG1000 preamp with Marshall EL34 100/100 power amp, and Yamaha DG130H, Yamaha DG100 combo etc.

In 2005, Cornford Amplification issued a Richie Kotzen signature model – RK100, a single channel tube amp head developed and designed in collaboration with Kotzen to suit his expansive playing style. Cornford ceased production of all amplifiers, including the RK100, in 2013. There were also matching signature model speaker cabinets, equipped with one or four Celestion Vintage 30 12&quot; speakers. Both the amplifier head and the speaker cabinets were the only Cornford models generally supplied with Kotzen-spec black Tolex covering. The 4 x 12&quot; cabinet also includes a special locking jack socket on the rear.

In 2013 he used a Fender Vibro-King amp with Winery Dogs.

Now Richie uses Victory Amplifiers. He has his very own Signature Victory Amp. 
Kotzen prefers not to use many pedals (or effects, in general) when playing live. However, over the years, he has been using several versions of Sobbat Drivebraker and Glowvibe pedals on top of Marshall amps when not playing with the Cornford. He also uses reverb and delay effects of his signature series Zoom G2R effects processor, which is connected in the effects loop of the amplifier. In 2014, Tech 21 started selling the Richie Kotzen Signature RK5 Fly Rig, which was developed in close collaboration with Richie, who used the final prototype for the bulk of his 2014 tour with the Winery Dogs.

<doc id="766674" wikidata="Q720240" url="?curid=766674" title="Mike Varney">
<text>Michael Varney (born 1958) is an American record producer and music publisher. He is the founder of the Shrapnel Label Group, which includes Shrapnel Records, Tone Center Records, and Blues Bureau International. He also owns 50% of Magna Carta Records, a New York–based label. Varney is often credited with popularizing the mid-1980s shred guitar boom, and has continuously specialized in producing musicians within the genres of instrumental rock, hard rock, jazz, jazz fusion, blues, blues-rock, progressive metal, and speed metal.

== Early life ==
Mike Varney grew up in Novato, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before forming Shrapnel Records, Varney played extensively with the pre-punk band, The Nuns. The Nuns were one of the most successful bands in the Bay Area at that time, regularly selling out at the local venues and clubs. He co-wrote and performed &quot;Rock Justice&quot; along with Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship&#x27;s Marty Balin, released by EMI in 1980. Varney also led his band, &quot;Cinema&quot;, which received wide recognition in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was known for searing lead guitar runs performed on his collection of Gibson SG guitars.

== Career ==

=== Shrapnel Records ===
Shrapnel Records was founded in 1980 by Mike Varney at the age of 22. It was the first record company in the U.S. strictly dedicated to heavy metal. Shrapnel was at the forefront of the neo-classical electric guitar and shred movements. Shrapnel Records was the first label to bring world attention to guitarists such as Yngwie Malmsteen (Steeler), Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Paul Gilbert, Racer X, Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, Greg Howe, Richie Kotzen, John5, and many others. Today Shrapnel continues to record guitarists and has also returned to his metal roots by releasing some classic metal and hard rock records due to a resurgence in interest.

=== &quot;Guitar Player&quot;&#x27;s Spotlight column ===
Mike Varney began his &quot;Spotlight&quot; column in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in 1982 as a vehicle for discovering talent among the magazine&#x27;s audience. His monthly column featured many so-called hometown heroes who sent in demos to showcase their abilities. Several players who were featured received opportunities to record with Shrapnel Records.

=== Blues Bureau International ===
Blues Bureau International, founded in 1991, is a label that has focused its attention on the blues-rock genre. Through the years the label has recorded many artists including Pat Travers, Rick Derringer, Eric Gales, Scott Henderson&#x27;s solo records as well as records from his group &quot;Tribal Tech&quot;, Glenn Hughes, Marc Ford, Chris Duarte, Neal Schon, The Outlaws, Joe Louis Walker, etc. The label continues to record artists in the electric blues style.

=== Tone Center ===
Tone Center Records, founded in 1997, is an independent record company owned by Varney, dedicated to recording high-level jazz, jazz/rock and fusion music. The roster is made up of some of the most well-known names in the instrumental jazz/rock/fusion world. The label&#x27;s records include performances by Frank Gambale, Eric Johnson, Warren Haynes, Steve Morse, Victor Wooten and Mike Stern.

<doc id="766675" wikidata="Q2595197" url="?curid=766675" title="Kanklės">
<text>The kanklės () is a Lithuanian plucked string instrument (chordophone) belonging to the Baltic box zither family known as the Baltic psaltery, along with the Latvian &quot;kokles&quot;, Estonian &quot;kannel&quot;, Finnish &quot;kantele&quot;, and Russian &quot;gusli&quot;.

== Etymology ==
According to Finnish linguist Eino Nieminen, the name of the instrument, along with the names of most of its neighbouring counterparts (Latvian &quot;kokles&quot;, Finnish &quot;kantele&quot;, Estonian &quot;kannel&quot; and Livonian &quot;kāndla&quot;), possibly comes from the proto-Baltic form &quot;*kantlīs&quot;/&quot;*kantlēs&quot;, which originally meant &#x27;the singing tree&#x27;, most likely deriving from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*qan-&quot; (&#x27;to sing, to sound&#x27;; cf. Latin &quot;canto, cantus, canticum&quot;, Italian &quot;cantare&quot;, French &quot;chanter&quot;, English &quot;chant, cantor&quot;).

A Lithuanian ethnologist Romualdas Apanavičius believes &quot;Kanklės&quot; could be derived from the Proto-European root &quot;*gan(dh)-&quot;, meaning &#x27;a vessel; a haft (of a sword)&#x27;, suggesting that it may be related to the Russian word &quot;gusli&quot;.

==Construction==

Although kanklės vary both regionally and individually, there are some common characteristics in their construction.

Kanklės belong to the zither family, which means that their strings are parallel to the soundboard (not perpendicular, like in a harp) and do not extend beyond it (not like in e.g. a guitar, where they extend to the neck). The body of the kanklės is made from one trapezoidal piece of linden tree, ash tree, oak, maple or black alder, which is hollowed out to create a cavity. A thin sheet of softwood (usually spruce) is used to make a soundboard, which covers the body. Soundholes, which traditionally take the shape of a stylized flower or star, are cut into the soundboard, allowing sound to project outward. At the narrowest side of the body, a metal bar is attached to which the strings made of wire or gut are anchored. The opposite ends of the strings are attached to a row of tuning pegs inserted into holes at the opposite side of the body.

Kanklės is usually rested on the player&#x27;s lap and played with the fingers or a pick made of bone or quill.

== History ==
According to Birutė Žalalienė, psaltery, coming from Western Europe, could have been used in Lithuania to accompany church singing since the 15th century, and later in folk music in Lithuania Minor and Samogitia.

The word &quot;kanklės&quot; is first used in writing in 1580 by Jonas Bretkūnas in his Bible translation. Vincas Kudirka published two collections of folk songs adapted for choirs, titled &quot;Kanklės&quot;, in 1895 and 1898. In 1906, Pranas Puskunigis established an ensemble of kanklės players, mostly from the students at the Veiveriai Teachers&#x27; Seminary, in . This ensemble, known simply as &quot;Kanklės&quot; since 1984, continues to this day. A school for kanklės players was opened in 1930 in Kaunas. Kanklės are taught at the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre since 1945. Concert kanklės were first constructed in 1964.

==Types==

Apanavičius classifies the kanklės into three basic traditional types, although there are variations within each type and some overlap of areas. Each type has its own playing technique.

* Kanklės of Northeastern Aukštaitians: the simplest and most ancient form. Carved out of a single piece of wood into a boat or coffin shape.
* Kanklės of Western Aukštaitians and Samogitians: somewhat larger than those of Northeastern Aukštaitija, usually having between eight and twelve strings. They have a flat bottom, and in some cases, the shortest end is carved with the stylized figure of a bird&#x27;s or fish&#x27;s tail.
* Kanklės of Northwestern Samogitians and Suvalkians: usually the most decorated type, and kanklės used in concert performance are most often based on this variety. The most prominent identifying feature is the addition of a carved spiral figure to the point of the instrument&#x27;s body and sometimes, the rounding of the narrow end of the body. Typically these instruments have between nine and thirteen strings.

Concert kanklės, with an expanded range of more than four octaves (29 strings, C3-C7) and added chromaticism, provided by means of metal levers at the side of the instrument, similar to the ones used in a Celtic or lever harp, were constructed in 1964 by P. Kupčikas following the design of P. Stepulis and D. Mataitienė. In the 1960s they followed the lead of Latvian concert kokles which had first been constructed in 1951.

<text>Miles Naismith Vorkosigan is a protagonist of a series of science fiction novels and short stories known as the Vorkosigan Saga, written by American author Lois McMaster Bujold.

==Personality==

===Traits===
Miles is depicted as both brilliant (especially in military tactics) and hyperactive; one of his girlfriends describes him as &quot;addicted to adrenaline rushes&quot;. He compulsively and constantly challenges the world, sometimes with disastrous consequences, although more often than not, his mind overcomes his physical weakness. As Simon Illyan says to Ekaterin when Miles is courting her in &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;, &quot;Do you know all those old folk tales where the Count tries to get rid of his only daughter&#x27;s unsuitable suitor by giving him three impossible tasks? Don&#x27;t ever try that with Miles. Just don&#x27;t.&quot;

He has a strong tendency to manipulate people and is very good at bluffing. The Dendarii Free Mercenaries, for instance, begin as pure imaginative figment, and through frantic improvisation, he conceals his deception from his recruits; their accomplishments make real his invention. Despite the initial successes of this &quot;lie first, fix later&quot; strategy, it always makes for manic juggling of various falsehoods and stories, and often ends up working against him. For instance: first, he is caught lying about his seizure disorder, and then the widow he loves is enraged when she discovers that he has been attempting to court her by stealth during her socially-recognized period of mourning.

===Romance and Sexuality===
His childhood love interest is Elena Bothari, the daughter of Sergeant Konstantin Bothari, but the feeling is not reciprocated. In the novel &quot;Cetaganda &quot;(1996), Miles has an unrequited crush on Rian Degtiar, the &quot;Handmaiden of the Star Crèche&quot; who later becomes an Empress of Cetaganda. As his alter ego, Admiral Naismith, Miles has relationships with Admiral Elli Quinn of the Dendarii Mercenaries and Taura, a sergeant of the same mercenary outfit who was originally created as a military experiment and later rescued by Miles in the short story &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. In the long term, Miles is looking for a wife who will become the future Lady Vorkosigan, a prospect that drives his non-Barrayaran lovers away. Eventually he falls for and wins the love of Ekaterin Vorsoisson in the novel &quot;Komarr&quot; (1998). 

While Miles primarily falls for women, in &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; (2002) he is forced to confront and admit his attraction for Betan Bel Thorne, a non-binary and intersex character:

===Inspiration ===
In an article in &quot;The Vorkosigan Companion&quot;, Bujold acknowledged several real-life inspirations for the character: T. E. Lawrence, a young Winston Churchill, &quot;a physical template in a handicapped hospital pharmacist I&#x27;d worked with&quot;, and even herself (the &quot;great man&#x27;s son syndrome&quot;). She also noted that she and her creation adopted dual personas, she as a housewife and writer, he as an aristocratic Vor scion and mercenary Admiral Naismith. However, she also asserted that Miles developed a personality all his own from the first book, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;.

==Reception==
In the&quot; New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;, October 1998 (Number 122), Miles is summarized as follows:

==Fictional character biography==

===Traumatic birth===
Miles Vorkosigan is the son of Aral Vorkosigan of the planet Barrayar and his Betan wife Cordelia Naismith. He has several physical impairments due to an assassination attempt directed at his parents. A poison gas grenade was thrown into their bedroom during Cordelia&#x27;s pregnancy with Miles but the couple&#x27;s lives were saved by quick administration of the antidote—a violent teratogen that destroys skeletal development in a growing fetus.

The only available treatment for the fetus was experimental at best, and would have been fatal to the mother. Miles was therefore transferred to an artificial uterine replicator in an effort to salvage his bone development. While in the replicator, Miles was kidnapped from the hospital and used as a hostage against his father by Vidal Vordarian, the leader of the Vordarian pretendership, putting a temporary halt to the treatments. He was ultimately born with &quot;chalk-stick bones, friable as talc&quot;, and is described as &quot;wizened as an infant homunculus.&quot;

===Appearance===
Despite repeated corrective surgeries, Miles&#x27;s height only reaches four-foot-nine at maturity. He has his mother&#x27;s sea grey eyes and his father&#x27;s dark hair. Miles is described as winter pale with laugh lines around his eyes and pain lines around his mouth. Miles was slightly hunch-backed, but after his death and cryo-revival, a surgeon managed to straighten his spine a bit, giving him a valued additional centimeter of height. Miles has fine scars running all over his body from having his easily broken bones replaced with synthetics in his twenties. Many people on Barrayar are prejudiced against him because they incorrectly believe him to be a mutant. &quot;Mutants&quot; (real or perceived, which are common on Barrayar due to a small population at the beginning of the Time of Isolation) are highly undesirable on Barrayar, and children visibly carrying a mutated gene are often killed by their families. Though the Time of Isolation is over, prejudice against mutants and the physically disabled is still very high.

===Abnormal name for the abnormal lord===
When his famous grandfather learns of the prenatal damage, he tries to abort the fetus in the replicator, and later tries to kill the infant because he believes that &quot;We cannot afford to have a deformed Count Vorkosigan.&quot; Count Piotr is thwarted in this by his own armsman, Sergeant Bothari, who is devoted to Cordelia. Vor male heirs are usually named with the first name of the paternal grandfather as the child&#x27;s first name, and the first name of the maternal grandfather as the middle name, and before the soltoxin Miles was to be named &quot;Piotr Miles Vorkosigan&quot;. When the Count, frustrated in his attempted infanticide, disinherits Aral and his family from his name and his property, Cordelia instead bestows her deceased father&#x27;s full name on her son, henceforth Miles Naismith Vorkosigan.

General Count Piotr is reconciled to his son, daughter-in-law and grandson when Miles becomes able to walk at age five, and shows a forceful interest in his grandfather&#x27;s beloved horses. This common ground, and observation of Miles&#x27; intelligence and determination, earns the boy Piotr&#x27;s respect and acceptance, and they have a closer though still challenging relationship until the Count&#x27;s death.

===Childhood and adolescence===
As a child, Miles is highly energetic and enjoys swimming and horseback riding, despite frequent injuries and broken bones. To compensate for the social disadvantage of his appearance, he develops tremendous charm and manipulation skills, even getting the Koudelka girls to march around as a &quot;precision drill team&quot;. He has a series of adventures and misadventures, including driving a hover tank through a barn at age 12. His companions when growing up include Elena Bothari, Miles&#x27;s bodyguard&#x27;s daughter; his cousin, Ivan Vorpatril; and his foster-brother, Emperor Gregor Vorbarra.

Miles grows up around the corridors of power, and learns to see his father&#x27;s powerful colleagues not as objects of awe but as fixtures in his home, as he listens to their frank discussions and arguments. This behind-the-scenes perspective will profoundly influence the course of his career.

At the age of 17, he fails the physical test to enter the Barrayaran Imperial Military Service Academy by jumping from a wall obstacle and breaking both legs on landing. To get over this disappointment, he takes a trip to his mother&#x27;s home world, Beta Colony; has (unintended) space adventures for a few months; and improvises a force called the Dendarii Mercenaries into existence. In the process, his lifelong protector Sergeant Bothari is killed. Miles is charged with treason, exonerated, and (through a little nepotism) accepted into the Barrayaran Imperial Military Service. After graduating he is asked to resolve an infanticide charge in Silvy Vale, a rural area of his father&#x27;s district (described in &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot;). The people he encounters and his experiences there strongly influence his sense of purpose and identity throughout the rest of his life.

===ImpSec career===
Shortly after graduating from the academy Miles is assigned to the worst posting in the Barrayaran Empire: Kyril Island. Kyril Island is a winter infantry training post often called &quot;Camp Permafrost&quot;. Miles is assigned as the weather officer for the base. There is an accident where a mutagenic poison is spilled and a few soldiers are ordered to clean it up without adequate protective gear. They refuse the order, and the infuriated base commander orders them to strip at gunpoint and stay outside in the snow until they are ready to comply. Deciding to join the objectors on ethical grounds, a naked Miles convinces the base commander to use an alternative method, but at the cost of ending his career as he is charged with mutiny.

When the full story comes out, Miles&#x27;s father leans on Simon Illyan to have Miles work in Covert Ops directly under Illyan. Miles is given difficult, sometimes seemingly impossible missions. He works only under Illyan with one rule: &quot;Deliver results or pay with your ass&quot;. Working deep cover missions in the persona of Miles Naismith, Miles is forced to improvise solutions to difficult questions extemporaneously. More often than not Miles talks his way into and out of life-threatening situations. Unfortunately, his physical appearance makes him hard to forget. When cornered by a reporter who sees the similarity between Miles Vorkosigan and Miles Naismith, he says that they are clone brothers.

At age 24, Miles&#x27; life becomes more complicated when he discovers that he has an actual clone, created by a Komarran terrorist with the aim of killing Miles, his family, and the Emperor, and ultimately becoming himself Emperor of Barrayar. His friends urge him to kill the clone, but due to the Betan influence on his upbringing, Miles thinks of the clone as his brother and lets him go free. Four years later, Miles is killed while trying to rescue his clone-brother, and although he is successfully cryo-frozen and revived, he is left with a condition which causes periodic seizures, particularly under great stress. He tries to conceal this from Simon Illyan, his boss and chief of Imperial Security (ImpSec). Miles falsifies a report after he has a seizure in combat, but this is detected and he is fired from ImpSec, putting an end to his life with the Dendarii as well. Miles is devastated as the character of Naismith had become the expression of everything he ever wanted, in essence he loses himself and his sense of purpose.

Almost immediately, he becomes suspicious of a plot against Illyan who has fallen ill and is being kept isolated; he requests the assignment of an Imperial Auditor to help him investigate the situation, but instead, the Emperor surprises him by making him the &quot;Ninth Auditor&quot;, a temporary designation by tradition, but nonetheless endowed with full Auditor powers. During the course of the investigation Miles confronts his quest for identity and wins.

His handling and solving of the case is reviewed by the other Auditors and his status as Auditor is made permanent. Miles is the first Imperial Auditor in the history of the Vorkosigans.

===Mid life—30s on===
Shortly thereafter, Vorkosigan accompanies one of his new colleagues, Lord Auditor Vorthys, to Komarr, home to the sole wormhole connecting Barrayar to the rest of the Nexus. (Barrayar, led by his father, conquered Komarr some years before Miles&#x27; birth in order to gain control of that vital access). Their mission is to investigate an accident involving the solar energy array orbiting Komarr; the accident turns out to have been caused by the secret testing of a new weapon with which Komarran conspirators hope to permanently collapse the wormhole and isolate Barrayar again. Miles is quartered with Lord Auditor Vorthys&#x27; niece and her husband, a Barrayaran official. In the course of the investigation, Miles survives yet another brush with death although his host, who has become ensnared in the plot, does not survive. To make a bad situation worse, Miles has fallen in love with his host&#x27;s wife (later widow), Ekaterin, who just happens to be on the verge of leaving her emotionally abusive husband when disaster strikes. She is then instrumental in foiling the plot. The entire affair is classified as secret due both to the political nature of the conspiracy and the new technology of the Komarran secret weapon.

Ekaterin, professing after her bad experiences with her late husband to be violently allergic to marriage, moves back to Barrayar with her nine-year-old son, Nikolai, to stay with her uncle, Lord Auditor Vorthys. Miles embarks upon a bizarre, if typically complicated, strategy: he will woo Ekaterin without telling her, in the hope that she can be persuaded to reconsider her stance. Miles&#x27;s plan backfires during a particularly disastrous dinner party to which Ekaterin is invited. She is initially furious when she discovers his machinations. An additional complication arises when rumors arise alleging that Miles murdered her husband in order to marry her. Due to the Imperial security concerns surrounding her husband&#x27;s death, she is not at liberty to refute the allegations, even when her relatives attempt to move her son to &quot;safety&quot;. This provokes her to drastic action: she proposes to Miles herself in a most public fashion; he accepts without hesitation.

In &quot;Winterfair Gifts&quot;, they are married during the mid-winter festival that marks the beginning of a new year on Barrayar, and survive yet another attack in which Ekaterin is poisoned by one of Miles&#x27; Auditorial suspects. The plot is foiled by Taura, one of his many former lovers, and Roic, one of his Armsmen.

Their honeymoon is delayed by a considerable period, during which they conceive twins who are nurtured in uterine replicators; while this is by now normal for well-to-do Barrayaran couples, it also conveniently allows the happy couple to leave the planet while their unborn children remain safely at home. In &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;, Emperor Gregor dispatches his youngest Auditor to defuse a diplomatic crisis at a Quaddie space station. The couple becomes embroiled in yet another deadly, complicated situation involving potential war with Cetaganda. Happily, Miles survives a near-death illness caused by exposure to a Cetagandan nanotech biological weapon, though he does suffer permanent damage, and they are able to return to Barrayar just in time for their children&#x27;s birth—a son named Aral Alexander and a daughter named Helen Natalia.

===Countship===
Following the death of his father from a brain aneurysm on Sergyar, Miles, at age 39, succeeds to the Countship of the Vorkosigan District. At that time, he has a stepson (Nikolai [approximately 17]), a son (Aral Alexander [5]), and three daughters (Helen Natalia [5], Lizzie [3], and Taurie [10 months]). In &quot;Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen&quot;, Alex and Helen are 11, Elizabeth is 8, Taurie is 5 and Selig with his not-twin Simone are two-ish.

Bujold has stated that she feels Miles dies at age 57; however, when later asked if she still had that opinion, she emphasized that &quot;The writer should always reserve the right to have a better idea.&quot;

==Admiral Naismith==
Admiral Naismith is an alter ego and cover identity that Miles developed as a youth and used until the novel &quot;Memory&quot;.

===Creation of Naismith===
Miles Vorkosigan developed an alternative identity as &quot;Admiral Naismith&quot;, under which he ran the Dendarii Mercenaries (formally the Oseran Mercenaries until Miles took over from Admiral Oser) until the novel &quot;Memory&quot;. It began as a lie but eventually evolved into a real cover identity. Even this was an improvisation, as Miles found himself facing charges of treason for raising a private army, and had to offer the Dendarii as a &quot;Crown Troop&quot; working in the service of Emperor Gregor to deflect the charges. Necessarily he had to be Admiral Naismith so that the Dendarii could carry out missions on behalf of Barrayar without the responsibility for those missions being traced back to Barrayar itself. Given the restricted life of a Vor lordling, and the galaxy-spanning horizons available to Naismith, Miles eventually came to value Naismith&#x27;s life over the one he was born to.

According to his mother, Cordelia, Miles invented Naismith, because Barrayar gave him &quot;so much unbearable stress, so much pain, he created an entire other personality to escape into. He then persuaded several thousand galactic mercenaries to support his psychosis, and ... conned the Barrayaran Imperium into paying for it all&quot;

===Identity===
Miles Vorkosigan himself once said to Emperor Gregor Vorbarra of Barrayar, &quot;I guess Naismith is me with no brakes. No constraints.&quot; This characteristic makes him a very dangerous enemy, as he is willing to take risks that most normal people would avoid. He also improvises brilliantly. Sent into a Cetagandan prison camp to find and extract one important Marilacan guerrilla leader, he managed to convert the mission into a full-scale breakout of most of the prisoners, using nothing more than the force of his personality, a screwball religion espoused by one of the inmates, and some coded comments picked up by his support team, who had infiltrated the Cetagandan garrison to monitor the mission. The success of this mission, and the ensuing rebellion on Marilac, caused the Cetagandans to put a price on Miles&#x27; head.

In theory, Naismith is a Betan by birth and speaks with the distinctive nasal Betan accent, which Miles learned from his mother. The typical Barrayaran accent is described as guttural in comparison. The back story that Miles improvised when taking over the Oseran mercenaries had him being part of a larger mercenary group, but in time it became apparent to veterans such as Captains Ky Tung and Bel Thorne that this was a lie. Officially the truth was known only to Miles, Elena Bothari, her husband Baz Jesek, Arde Mayhew, and Miles&#x27;s second-in-command and lover Elli Quinn.

Later, Miles developed a cover that he was a clone made by the Cetagandans meant to infiltrate Barrayar by replacing Miles Vorkosigan. This turned out to be ironic, as there was a real clone made for just that purpose, but by Komarrans. When Miles encountered, and made peace with, his clone brother Mark, this allowed Miles to cement his cover by having two Cetagandans, an officer and an intelligence agent, see both Miles and Mark together.

Eventually, switching between Naismith and Vorkosigan became a problem for Miles. This was especially true on Earth, when fleeing the Cetagandans, he had to work in the Barrayaran embassy as Miles Vorkosigan, while still commanding the fleet during a difficult and expensive refit. It was complicated by his developing affair with Elli Quinn, who was adamant that while she loved Admiral Naismith, she did not like Lord Vorkosigan at all. It also complicated his dealings with various plots on his life, since he did not always know which were directed at Naismith, and which at Vorkosigan.

===Decline and fall===
Naismith—and Vorkosigan—was fatally shot with a needle grenade during a botched rescue mission on the planet Jackson&#x27;s Whole. Miles was trying to rescue his clone brother Mark, who had impersonated Naismith for his own purposes. Fortunately cryo-preservation was available and eventually Miles was revived. Meanwhile, Mark, despite gorging himself into obesity, had to become Naismith for a time. The chaotic story is described in the novel &quot;Mirror Dance&quot;.

As a result of his death and cryo-preservation, Miles Vorkosigan suffered neurological damage resulting in seizures triggered by the buildup of stress-related neurotransmitters, ensuring that he is most likely to have a seizure when he most needs to be lucid. When a seizure results in a badly botched mission, Miles covers it up. Illyan quickly discovers the coverup and Miles, in both personas, is fired from ImpSec. This precipitates a crisis for Miles, for whom Admiral Naismith was not just a role but his life—a better one, perhaps, than his &quot;real&quot; life on Barrayar. On hearing the news of Miles&#x27; dismissal, his mother, Cordelia Vorkosigan, bet her husband Aral Vorkosigan that Miles would choose &quot;the little admiral&quot; and run off with the Mercenaries.

Miles Vorkosigan mourned the loss of Admiral Naismith for a long time. However, his new role as Imperial Auditor gives him the opportunity to use Naismith&#x27;s talents once more but as part of Lord Vorkosigan&#x27;s life. As Ivan Vorpatril describes it, Vorkosigan as Naismith means &quot;full tilt forward, no inhibitions, innocent bystanders scramble for their lives.&quot; Miles at last finds that he doesn&#x27;t need to run away from Barrayar to have both the Lord and the Admiral.

Even had Miles not been fired from ImpSec, Naismith&#x27;s effectiveness as a cover was coming to an end. During the celebration of Emperor Gregor&#x27;s wedding, &quot;ghem&quot;-General Dag Benin passed Miles a message from the Cetagandan Emperor, expressing condolences over Naismith&#x27;s death. The clear implication is that the Cetagandans have at some point learned the truth. Benin also informs Miles that the Emperor would prefer Naismith to remain deceased, to which Miles responded, &quot;I &quot;trust&quot; his resurrection will not be required.&quot;

===Fictional appearances===
Miles Vorkosigan first appeared in Bujold&#x27;s novel &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1986), although his parents had appeared in the earlier &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; (also 1986), set before Miles&#x27;s birth.

According to &quot;The Vorkosigan Companion&quot;, the internal sequence of the books featuring Miles (although not the order in which they were written) is:

== Mark Vorkosigan ==
Mark Vorkosigan is Miles&#x27; clone-brother, born six years after Miles. He is created in a plot by Ser Galen, a Komarran terrorist, to replace Miles, assassinate Miles&#x27; father Aral and Emperor Gregor Vorbarra, claim the Imperial Throne, and foment chaos and revolution. Miles, under the influence of his mother&#x27;s Betan upbringing, refuses to kill Mark or even hinder him, and only desires that he come to Barrayar as a true Vorkosigan. Mark, after he kills Ser Galen (who had become both his tormentor and father-figure) refuses, and goes his own way. Mark looks a bit different than Miles because of crude attempts to simulate the effects of the chemical Miles was exposed to &quot;in utero&quot; that affected the development of his bones (&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;)

However, after a few years, Mark resurfaces and infiltrates the Dendarii Mercenaries by posing as Admiral Miles Naismith, planning to send them on a mission to liberate more than 40 clones who are scheduled for body harvesting. The scheme is only semi-successful, as the clones are rescued, but Miles is seemingly killed by a needle grenade. While Miles&#x27; body is missing (it turns out he is in stasis in cryogenic freeze, but found by people who do not know his true identity), Mark is returned to Barrayar, now uncomfortably situated as Count Vorkosigan&#x27;s heir if Miles is dead. Mark is able to convince Countess Vorkosigan to allow him to mount a rescue mission—to Illyan&#x27;s dismay—for Miles. Mark is captured by Baron Ryoval, who subjects him to physical, sexual and mental torture, during which Mark develops an unusual psychosis that he later dubs &quot;The Black Gang&quot;, a group of specialist sub-personalities: &quot;Grunt&quot; (Mark&#x27;s sexuality), &quot;Gorge&quot; (Mark&#x27;s gluttony), &quot;Howl&quot; (Mark&#x27;s masochism), and &quot;Killer&quot; (Mark&#x27;s assassin personality). 
&quot;The Black Gang&quot; protects a fifth personality, &quot;Lord Mark&quot; (Marks own, fragile and newborn personal identity) from the tortures inflicted on it by Ryoval, and after Killer kills Ryoval, Lord Mark emerges to take charge, being the only one who can think outside of one purpose. The Black Gang serve Lord Mark well—using his split personality, he is able to kill the Baron, and sell 90% of his assets to the Baron&#x27;s rival, Fell, receiving a healthy cut (of a value of approximately 2 million Betan dollars, or 8 - 10 million Barrayaran marks) of Ryoval&#x27;s estate and ownership of a bioresearch firm that Mark subsidizes to combat the &quot;clone chop shops&quot; of Jackson&#x27;s Whole. He also attracts the attentions of Kareen Koudelka, the youngest daughter of Count and Countess Vorkosigan&#x27;s closest family friends. (&quot;Mirror Dance&quot;)

To distinguish himself from Miles, Mark allows himself to grow grotesquely overweight. Contrary to Miles, Mark is deadly in unarmed combat, having been trained as an assassin, and having developed masochistic tendencies. When he is relatively thinner, he has been described as &quot;a small tank&quot;. His romance with Kareen deepened while they were both studying on Beta Colony. Unfortunately, his relationship became strained upon their return to Barrayar when Kareen&#x27;s parents learned of their sexual relationship at Miles&#x27; famously disastrous dinner party. Countess Vorkosigan ultimately stepped in and brokered an arrangement for them. During this time, Mark invested in a business deal with the galactic scientist Enrique Borgos, who had created a new insect livestock he called &quot;Butter Bugs&quot;. Initially grotesque, if highly functional, Ekaterin Vorsoissons&#x27;s design changes made the newly renamed &quot;Glorious Bugs&quot; highly popular. (&quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;).

Mark&#x27;s legal status changes depending on which set of laws is applied. There is no Barrayaran tradition or law regarding clones, but as several characters observe during the Saga, &quot;anything done twice on Barrayar is a tradition&quot;. Mark is pushed out into Vor society as Miles&#x27; brother and, at first, potential heir to the title of Count Vorkosigan. Other Vor may challenge this, if they dare. Under the laws of Beta Colony, the birthplace of Cordelia Naismith, Mark could be considered Cordelia&#x27;s son, Miles&#x27;s son, or the son of Ser Galen, depending on how the circumstances of his creation are interpreted. Mark regards himself as a native of Jackson&#x27;s Whole, where there is no law of any kind other than the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, as in &quot;He who has the gold makes the rules.&quot; Thus, on Jackson&#x27;s Whole, Mark was created with no human rights and could have been killed at any time.

He is half-owner of the Durona Group, sharing control with Lily Durona. He travels across the galaxy of his far-flung financial empire with his unmarried life partner Kareen Koudelka, who serves as the good cop to his bad cop during business meetings.

== Analysis ==
Miles has been discussed as an example of an atypical space opera, science fiction hero - &quot;short and handicapped, unlike the traditional tall, dark and handsome heroes of popular space opera&quot;. He wins against adversity because of his skills, including rhetorical ones, rather than physical prowess.

<text>The Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party/Re-Organized Movement of the Party of the Proletariat (, PCTP/MRPP) is a Maoist political party in Portugal.

== History and overview ==
The party was founded in 1970 as the (MRPP), led by Arnaldo de Matos. It changed its name to the Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party in 1976.

The PCTP-MRPP has held a Maoist political orientation since its foundation. In 1971, the party began to publish a newspaper called &quot;Luta Popular&quot; (People&#x27;s Struggle), directed by Saldanha Sanches. The party was among the most active resistance movements before the Carnation Revolution, especially among students in Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large murals. The party became intensely active during 1974 and 1975. At that time, the party boasted members who later became important political figures, including José Manuel Durão Barroso and Fernando Rosas, who subsequently left the party. The party, however, never managed to elect a single Member of Parliament in legislative elections.

During the revolutionary period of 1974 and 1975, the MRPP was accused by the Portuguese Communist Party of being an agent of the CIA, a belief that was fueled by cooperation between the MRPP and the Socialist Party against the communist program defended by the Portuguese Communist Party.

The party&#x27;s youth wing, now extinct, was the Marxist–Leninist Students Federation, to which José Manuel Durão Barroso, a future Prime Minister from the centre-right Social Democratic Party, briefly belonged.

The party entered a phase of internal turmoil following the 2015 legislative elections, with its leader António Garcia Pereira leaving the party. Details about the internal functioning of the party became difficult to obtain, since none of the official contacts responded to contacts, and even the official headquarters seemed to no longer be functioning. An extraordinary congress was announced, but it is unknown if it really happened. Some sources claim the party is now operating at a clandestine level.

Despite this, the party contested the 2017 local elections, gaining 12,387 votes (0.24%) but losing the two council seats they held.

On 22 February 2019 Arnaldo Matos, founder and leader of the PCTP/MRPP since 1970, died.

<text>A cant is the jargon or language of a group, often employed to exclude or mislead people outside the group. It may also be called a cryptolect, argot, pseudo-language, anti-language or secret language. Each term differs slightly in meaning; their uses are inconsistent.

==Etymology==
There are two main schools of thought on the origin of the word &quot;cant&quot;:

* In linguistics, the derivation is normally seen to be from the Irish word (older spelling ), &quot;speech, talk&quot;, or Scottish Gaelic . It is seen to have derived amongst the itinerant groups of people in Ireland and Scotland, who hailed from both Irish/Scottish Gaelic and English-speaking backgrounds, ultimately developing as various creole languages. However, the various types of cant (Scottish/Irish) are mutually unintelligible. The Irish creole variant is termed &quot;the cant&quot;. Its speakers from the Irish Traveller community know it as &quot;Gammon&quot;, while the linguistic community identifies it as &quot;shelta&quot;.
* Outside Gaelic circles, the derivation is typically seen to be from Latin , &#x27;to sing&#x27;, via Norman French . Within this derivation, the history of the word is seen to have referred to the chanting of friars initially, used disparagingly some time between the 12th and 15th centuries. Gradually, the term was applied to the singsong of beggars and eventually a criminal jargon.

==Argot==
An &quot;argot&quot; (; from French &quot;argot&quot; &#x27;slang&#x27;) is a language used by various groups to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term &quot;argot&quot; is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which sense it overlaps with &quot;jargon&quot;.

In his 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables,&quot; Victor Hugo refers to that argot as both &quot;the language of the dark&quot; and &quot;the language of misery&quot;.

The earliest known record of the term &quot;argot&quot; in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name , given to a group of thieves at that time.

Under the strictest definition, an &quot;argot&quot; is a proper language with its own grammatical system. Such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are lexically divergent forms of a particular language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; &quot;argot&quot; used in this sense is synonymous with &quot;cant&quot;. For example, &quot;argot&quot; in this sense is used for systems such as and , which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words). Such systems are examples of &quot;argots&quot; , or &quot;coded argots&quot;.

Specific words can go from argot into everyday speech or the other way. For example, modern French &#x27;crazy&#x27;, &#x27;goofy&#x27;, now common usage, originated in the transformation of Fr. &#x27;crazy&#x27;.

In the field of medicine, physicians have been said to have their own spoken argot, cant, or slang, which incorporates commonly understood abbreviations and acronyms, frequently used technical colloquialisms, and much everyday professional slang (that may or may not be institutionally or geographically localized). While many of these colloquialisms may prove impenetrable to most lay people, few seem to be specifically designed to conceal meaning from patients (perhaps because standard medical terminology would usually suffice anyway).

==Anti-language==
The concept of the &quot;anti-language&quot; was first defined and studied by the linguist Michael Halliday, who used the term to describe the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of an anti-society. An anti-society is a small, separate community intentionally created within a larger society as an alternative to or resistance of it. For example, Adam Podgórecki studied one anti-society composed of Polish prisoners; Bhaktiprasad Mallik of Sanskrit College studied another composed of criminals in Calcutta.

These societies develop anti-languages as a means to prevent outsiders from understanding their communication and as a manner of establishing a subculture that meets the needs of their alternative social structure. Anti-languages differ from slang and jargon in that they are used solely among ostracized social groups, including prisoners, criminals, homosexuals, and teenagers. Anti-languages use the same basic vocabulary and grammar as their native language in an unorthodox fashion. For example, anti-languages borrow words from other languages, create unconventional compounds, or utilize new suffixes for existing words. Anti-languages may also change words using metathesis, reversal of sounds or letters (e.g., apple to &quot;elppa&quot;), or substituting their consonants. Therefore, anti-languages are distinct and unique and are not simply dialects of existing languages.

In his essay &quot;Anti-Language&quot;, Halliday synthesized the research of Thomas Harman, Adam Podgórecki, and Bhaktiprasad Mallik to explore anti-languages and the connection between verbal communication and the maintenance of a social structure. For this reason, the study of anti-languages is both a study of sociology and linguistics. Halliday&#x27;s findings can be compiled as a list of nine criteria that a language must meet to be considered an anti-language:

* An anti-society is a society set up within another society as a conscious alternative to it.
* Like the early records of the languages of exotic cultures, the information usually comes to us as word lists.
* The simplest form taken by an anti-language is that of new words from old: it is a language relexicalised.
* The principle is that of same grammar, different vocabulary.
* Effective communication depends on exchanging meanings that are inaccessible to the layperson.
* The anti-language is not just an optional extra; it is the fundamental element in the existence of the &quot;second life&quot; phenomenon.
* The most important vehicle of reality-maintenance is conversation. All who employ this same form of communication are reality-maintaining others.
* The anti-language is a vehicle of resocialisation.
* There is continuity between language and anti-language.

Examples of anti-languages include Cockney rhyming slang, CB slang, verlan, the &quot;grypsera&quot; of Polish prisons, thieves&#x27; cant, Polari, and Bangime.

===In popular culture===
Anti-languages are sometimes created by authors and used by characters in novels. These anti-languages do not have complete lexicons, cannot be observed in use for linguistic description, and therefore cannot be studied in the same way a language spoken by an existing anti-society would. However, they are still used in the study of anti-languages. Roger Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Languages in Fiction&quot; analyzes Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and William S. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; to redefine the nature of the anti-language and to describe its ideological purpose.

&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is a popular example of a novel where the main character is a teenage boy who speaks an anti-language called Nadsat. This language is often referred to as an argot, but it has been argued that it is an anti-language because of the social structure it maintains through the social class of the droogs.

== Regional usage of term ==
In parts of Connacht, in Ireland, &quot;cant&quot; mainly refers to an auction, typically on fair day (&quot;Cantmen and Cantwomen, some from as far away as Dublin, would converge on Mohill on a Fair Day, ... set up their stalls ... and immediately start auctioning off their merchandise&quot;) and secondly means talk (&quot;very entertaining conversation was often described as &#x27;great cant&#x27;&quot; or &quot;crosstalk&quot;).

In Scotland, two unrelated creole languages are termed &quot;cant&quot;. &quot;Scottish Cant&quot; (a mixed language, primarily Scots and Romani with Scottish Gaelic influences) is spoken by lowland Roma groups. &quot;Highland Traveller&#x27;s Cant&quot; (or &quot;Beurla Reagaird&quot;) is a Gaelic-based cant of the Indigenous Highland Traveller population. The cants are mutually unintelligible.

The word has also been used as a suffix to coin names for modern-day jargons such as &quot;medicant&quot;, a term used to refer to the type of language employed by members of the medical profession that is largely unintelligible to lay people.

=== Thieves&#x27; cant ===
The thieves&#x27; cant was a feature of popular pamphlets and plays, particularly between 1590 and 1615, but continued to feature in literature through the 18th century. There are questions about how genuinely the literature reflected vernacular use in the criminal underworld. A thief in 1839 claimed that the cant he had seen in print was nothing like the cant then used by &quot;gypsies, thieves, and beggars.&quot; He also said that each of these used distinct vocabularies, which overlapped, the gypsies having a cant word for everything, and the beggars using a lower style than the thieves.
